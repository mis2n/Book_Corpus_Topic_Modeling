REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
DerparTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, 
Bureau or Epucation, 
Washington, September 25, 1909. 
Si: It is now possible, in accordance with an arrangement between 
the Secretary of the Interior and the Public Printer, to count with 
confidence on the issuance of the first volume of the annual report 
of this office by the first week in December next following the close 
of the fiscal and scholastic year to which it relates; and the second 
volume, including the statistical tables, by the first week of the next 
following month of March. In view of this relatively early issuance 
of the first volume we may fairly expect that it will be widely used 
as a yearbook for ordinary reference in connection with educational 
movements of the recent past and the educational programme of the 
immediate future. Accordingly, every effort has been put forth in 
this office to render those portions of the volume which might serve 
such purposes as full and accurate as possible. 
As a result of this effort the volume herewith presented will be 
found to contain numerous bare statements of fact. These several 
statements are necessarily packed, each of them, into small compass 
and with very little of connective tissue. It is believed that, in this 
form they will best serve the diverse uses to which they will be put 
by different readers, each of whom will supply his own oe and 
interpretation of the facts which he employs. 
There are, however, many readers of such reports to whom some 
provisional coordination and interpretation of these various mate- 
rials may be of service. It is not to be forgotten that the changes 
and incidents herein set forth are not in reality unrelated one to 
another, but are, all of them, parts of one great movement of our 
civilization, each holding a place of its own in some current of that 
general movement. It is obvious that any survey which should at- 
tempt to map out the limits or determine the direction of these 
several currents must be altogether provisional in character. Even 
so, it would seem to promise a certain usefulness, in view of present 
needs. Accordingly attention will be called in the following para- 
graphs to some of the more important tendencies which can already 
be discerned in the educational world, particularly within the limits

of the United States, in the period under consideration. Inasmuch 
as the statistical portion of the report is to follow this volume within 
a brief period, the numerical summaries which have in the past 
appeared in connection with the commissioner’s introduction are this 
year deferred for presentation in the second volume. 
EDUCATION AND MORALS. 
1. The year 1908-9 has been marked in our educational history by 
an unusual emphasis upon the moral aspects of instruction. In the 
month of September, 1908, there was held at the University of Lon- 
don what was known as the First International Moral Education 
Congress. The published record of the proceedings of this congress 
opens with the following brief survey of recent movements in moral 
education : 
The remarkable success of the First International Moral Education Congress 
is explained by the fact that during the last decade the interest in moral educa- 
tion has grown on all sides. In 1905 a new Italian education code was pub- 
lished, laying the utmost stress on moral education and making detailed regu- 
lations with regard to moral instruction. In the following year a new Hun- 
garian education code was issued, which is even more emphatic and detailed 
in its references to moral education. In 1905 a new Austrian education code 
came to light, containing a large number of references to moral education. In 
Portugal an excellent manual of moral instruction for primary schools, as dis- 
tinct from religious instruction, was officially published in 1906, and approved 
by the cardinal of Lisbon (Compendio de Moral e Doutrina Christa, by Conego 
Manuel Anaguim, Lisbon; Livraria Ferreira). In the United States schemes of 
moral instruction have been elaborated in many places. In Germany the most 
recent reading books for elementary schools contain abundance of ethical mat- 
ter. In Switzerland several cantons have taken distinct steps in the direction 
of drawing up moral instruction programmes. In Belgium excellent moral 
instruction syllabuses for primary schools and for training colleges exist. In 
France and Japan, where moral instruction has already been introduced, the 
subject is being studied with redoubled interest. In Russia the authorities are 
turning their attention to this subject. And, finally, in England the code of the 
board of education for 1906 stated that “ moral instruction should form an 
important part of every school curriculum.” 
While this congress was initiated by the International Union of 
Ethical Societies, it was given a broadly inclusive character, and 
achieved a noteworthy success in bringing together the representa- 
tives of widely divergent schools of thought. The substantial inter- 
est which it aroused is evidenced by the fact that it embraced repre- 
sentatives of twenty-one governments. A volume of Papers on Moral 
Education was published for the executive committee of the congress. 
The articles included in this volume present the subject in the greatest 
variety of ways, and give an impression of the astonishing amount 
of thought and interest which it has of late aroused. The separately 
published Records of the Proceedings includes an illuminating memo-
-P-A-G-E-15
  THE COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. 3 
randum on his “General impressions of the outcome of the congress,” 
contributed by Prof. J. H. Muirhead. Professor Muirhead’s first 
impression was of the vast amount of thought that is being given, in 
all parts of the civilized world, to the y\roblem of moral education. 
Along with this was the impression a the countries represented 
were able to show in their reports a great amount of solid achieve- 
ment in this field, particularly as regards the newer type of school 
under municipal control. The second impression was “ that school 
is only a part, and at the best a very small part, of the means.” These 
impressions as to matters of general agreement are followed by a 
third impression as to the great significance of the discussions in 
which marked disagreement appeared. Such differences were in evi- 
dence in the discussion of the moral value of coeducation and of 
systematic moral instruction. These, however, were insignificant in 
comparison with the differences concerning the relation between moral 
and religious education. It would appear from Professor Muirhead’s 
memorandum that the discussion of this, the most delicate and diffi- 
cult subject with which the congress could deal, was marked by 
dignity and seriousness, and might be expected to contribute some- 
what to a common understanding on the part of those approaching 
the question from opposite sides. 
There have been other years in which attention has been strongly 
centered upon this subject. Moral education has, however, been 
mainly discussed in the past, outside of ethical societies and purely 
pedagogical circles, as subsidiary to some other interest. The dis- 
cussions of the past year show a marked tendency toward the con- 
sideration of morals as an independent and dominant concern in all 
educational procedure. While the relations of ethics to other subjects 
necessarily occupy a large place in these discussions, it is a normative 
rather than a tributary part which is commonly assigned to the 
ethical view of life. 
In addition to the papers of the Moral Education Congress, a num- 
ber of other significant publications have appeared. Foremost among 
these is the report on Moral Instruction and Training in Schools, in 
two volumes, edited on behalf of the international committee on moral 
training by Dr. Michael E. Sadler. The initial steps which led to the 
appointment of this international committee were taken by the Rev- 
erend Doctor Paton, of Nottingham, England, Mr. Harrold Johnson, 
Mr. Clifford W. Barnes, and Mr. W. T. Stead. The first fruits of 
their labors, as presented in this two-volume report, add greatly to 
the rich materials presented by the Moral Education Congress. It 
embraces brief accounts of the teaching of morals in many lands. 
A brief list of recent books and articles relating to moral educa- 
tion is appended to this introduction.

RECOMMENDATIONS. 
One of the definite forms which the question of moral education 
assumes in this country is the question as to provision in our courses 
of study for the direct and systematic teaching of morals. With 
reference to this question, it should be remarked in the first place that 
any such instruction can furnish at best only a small part of the actual 
moral education to be effected by the school. The view has been re- 
peatedly emphasized that all school training and instruction that is 
worth anything is moral in its influence. It should be added that 
mere talk about morals is the driest part, as the mere appeal to moral 
emotion is the least substantial part, of what the school can accom- 
plish in this field. The moral life is rooted in every serious occupa- 
tion in life. The pursuit of the sciences, the preparation for indus- 
try, and all other school occupations are not only associated with per- 
vasive moral influences, but they offer also some of the substantial 
materials of moral character. It is none the less true that, because 
the moral life is rooted in all forms of human occupation and interest, 
the intellectual interest in clear thinking and system is one of its sup- 
ports; and one of the available and necessary modes of approach to 
the subject is that of direct instruction concerning its various aspects, 
forms, and characteristics. Such detailed and orderly instruction, 
moreover, may be mightily reenforced by examples drawn from his- 
tory and literature and from every-day experience. 
The achievements of France and Japan as regards systematic moral 
instruction in the public schools is worthy of the most careful con- 
sideration. With all of its deficiencies, such instruction in these two 
countries has apparently accomplished much that is well worth the 
doing. As President Thwing has said in his recent work on Educa- 
tion in the Far East, speaking of Japan: 
No subject of the whole course of study, from the primary school to the uni- 
versity, is so commonly taught or is so constantly honored in its teaching as 
the science of right living (p. 14). 
No subject has taken a serious place in the make-up of an educated 
man until it has been consciously thought about and studied, and 
morals can be no exception to the rule. Much interest, accordingly, 
attaches to the efforts which have been making, particularly within 
the past year in this country, to prepare really interesting and in- 
forming manuals of moral instruction and to devise methods of teach- 
ing this subject in the public schools. The outcome of some of these 
efforts is indicated in the list of publications at the end of this intro- 
duction. I wish to call the especial attention of school authgrities to 
the importance of providing in some way for explicit instruction in 
this subject in the public schools, not omitting reference to the side of
-P-A-G-E-17
  THE COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. 5 
civic and industrial obligations and that of courtesy in manners. Let 
it be frankly admitted that such explicit teaching is the smallest part 
of the work to be done, but let it not be forgotten that it is also an 
indispensable part. 
Those who would maintain that the moral life has other rootings 
than that in religion, would, for the most part, admit that it is deeply 
rooted in religion, and that for many of our people its strongest 
motives are to be found in their religious convictions; that many, in 
fact, would regard it as insufficiently grounded and nourished with- 
out such religious convictions. The teaching of religious systems is 
no longer under serious consideration so far as our public schools are 
concerned. Historical and social influences have drawn a definite line 
in this country between the public schools and the churches, leaving 
the rights and responsibilities of religious instruction to the latter. 
It would be futile, even if it were desirable, to attempt to revise this 
decision of the American people. There has been, however, within 
the past two or three years a widespread discussion of the proposal 
that arrangements be made between the educational authorities and 
ecclesiastical organizations under which pupils should be excused 
from the schools for one half-day in the week—Wednesday afternoon 
has been suggested—in order that they may in that time receive re- 
ligious and moral instruction in their several churches. This proposal 
has been set forth in detail by the Rev. George U. Wenner, D. D., in 
a volume entitled “ Religious Education and the Public School ” (see 
the list of references at the end of this chapter), and has been under 
consideration by a representative committee during the past two or 
three years. 
A good deal of interest attaches to this proposal, which is closely 
related to the practice followed in the public schools of St. Louis 
many years ago during the superintendency of Dr. William T. Harris. 
Whether the plan is workable on a large scale or not, under American 
conditions, can only be determined by a fair trial in communities in 
which public sentiment clearly supports the experiment. It is not to 
be supposed that it will even be put upon its trial in the absence of 
such public sentiment. In any community which should provide for 
the withdrawal of pupils from the public schools, by their parents, 
for such hours of religious instruction, it is fair to expect that 
emphasis will be laid by the religious teachers upon those moral 
values which are the immediate concern of the state; and these hours, 
moreover, should be utilized by the school authorities for such serious 
and well-considered moral instruction as may properly be given to 
those pupils who, by their parents’ choice, should spend them in the 
public school under the care of their regular teachers.

  6 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
ART EDUCATION. 
2. However faithfully the fine arts may be taught for their own 
sake, without moralizing, their moral implications are subtle and 
profound. For this reason and for every reason a large significance 
attaches to the efforts which are now making to further the develop- 
ment of art education in this country. We are still too prone to treat 
the fine arts, including music, as a pretty embroidery upon our edu- 
cational fabric. It is safe to say that we shall not get a well-balanced 
education as regards moral influence, civic ideals, or personal and 
industrial efficiency, until instruction on the side of the arts shall 
become as seriously and effectively organized in our courses of studies 
as is instruction on the side of the sciences. Art is, indeed, as Dr. 
Halsey Ives has put it, “a constructive influence in the development 
of civilization.” 
As regards the general diffusion of art education, the significant 
event of the year was the Third International Art Congress for the 
Development of Drawing and Art Teaching and their Application to 
Industries. The congress was held in London, in the month of 
August, 1908. Its title relates it to the renewed activity in respect to 
industrial or vocational training. This latter movement reaches down 
to the very foundations of democratic society where, also, in every 
modern nation must be laid the basis of national art. 
A permanent and valuable result of child study is exemplified in 
the importance attached, in this congress, to the child’s own interest 
in the initial stages of art instruction. This principle was emphasized 
in the discussions, and it is a marked feature of the new system of 
art instruction adopted by the French Government for its schools 
during the present year. In this particular the influence of American 
precedents is recognized. But while, as the art work of our schools 
plainly shows, we hold a commanding position in respect to the early 
stages of instruction in this branch, our own representatives at the 
London congress were struck by the weak points in the more ad- 
vanced stages of our school work. Their opinions on these oe 
quoted elsewhere in this report, deserve special attention. 
The effort to secure unity of action on the part of the various 
agencies engaged in this country in the development of the fine arts 
led to a meeting at Washington in May, 1909, which resulted in the 
formation of a federation of American art societies. The proceed- 
ings of the convention which called this association into existence 
indicate its broad purpose. The province of fine arts, as an expression 
of ideal beauty, was here related to the creation of a national sense 
of beauty through the instrumentalities of common life—the school, 
the home, rural highways, and the “ city beautiful.”
-P-A-G-E-19
  THE COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. % 
On account of the signal interest in the subject of art instruction 
at the present time, and the broader aspects which the subject is 
assuming, the moment seemed opportune for a comprehensive survey 
of the agencies for the promotion of this interest in our own country. 
Such a survey has accordingly been presented in .a statistical mono- 
graph issued as a number of the bulletin of this office, bearing the 
title “ Instruction in the Fine and Manual Arts in the United States,” 
which was prepared by Mr. Henry Turner Bailey, one of the repre- 
sentatives of this department at the London congress. (Bureau of 
Education, Bulletin, 1909, No. 6, 184 p.) Attention should be called 
also to the attractive illustrated volume entitled “Art Education in 
the Public Schools of the United States,” which was edited by Mr. 
James Parton Haney, as part of the American exhibit at the con- 
gress. (New York, American Art Annual, 1908, 432 p.) 
EDUCATION FOR HEALTH. 
8. The hygienic side of education has been brought under strong 
emphasis in the course of the year. Such emphasis was first laid and 
most conspicuously by the International Congress on Tuberculosis, 
held in the city of Washington September 21—October 12, 1908. This 
congress was attended by many of the foremost authorities of all 
lands in matters relating to tuberculosis. By its discussions, its 
exhibits, and its awards, it directed the attention of our people as 
never before to the need of general knowledge touching the preven- 
tion of tubercular diseases; and inasmuch as these preventive meas- 
ures are in large part those which make for the general health of the 
body, the influence of the congress has counted for the advancement 
of educational hygiene in all of its aspects. 
The measures adopted in this country to check the spread of tuber- 
culosis have been reviewed by Mr. Phil P. Jacobs, of the National 
Association for the Study and Prevention of Tuberculosis, who states 
that appropriations of over $4,000,000 for the suppression of con- 
sumption have been made by 28 States in the year 1909. With ap- 
propriations from cities and counties and nearly $1,000,000 from the 
National Government, it is estimated that about $8,000,000, all told, 
have been publicly appropriated during the past year for the fight 
against tuberculosis. Of the 48 States and Territories whose legis- 
latures held sessions after January 1, 1909, 28 passed laws pertain- 
ing to this disease. (The Survey, vol. 22, p. 821-822, September 18, 
1909.) 
It is indeed fortunate that this special propaganda should have 
given to the movement for health-teaching in the schools such an 
impetus as many years of more general advocacy had failed to bring
-P-A-G-E-20
  8 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
about. Particular attention should be called to the findings of the 
jury of awards of the Tuberculosis Congress with reference to edu- 
cational leaflets submitted in competition. The following is a list 
of the more important of these awards: 
CLASS A.—LEAFLETS FOR ADULTS GENERALLY. 
$100 prize (highest award).—Plain facts about tuberculosis. Pennsylvania 
Society for the Prevention of Tuberculosis. 
Silver medal.—Schutz vor Schwindsucht. Verein zur Bekiimpfung der 
Schwindsucht in Chemnitz und Umgebung. 
Special award, gold medal.—Consumption is the most common form of tuber- 
culosis and is a germ disease. O. D. Wescott, M. D., Denver, Colo. 
CLASS B.—LEAFLETS FOR TEACHERS. 
Gold medal.—Tuberculosis, a leaflet for teachers. H. S. Goodall, M. D., New 
York. 
Silver medal.—The warfare against tuberculosis and the relation of teachers 
thereto. George H. Kress, M. D., Los Angeles, Cal. 
CLASS C.—LEAFLETS FOR MOTHERS. 
$100 prize (highest award).—Schutz vor Schwindsucht. Merkblatt fiir Miit- 
ter. Verein zur Bekiimpfung der Schwindsucht in Chemnitz und Umgebung. 
Gold medal.—Facts a mother should know concerning tuberculosis. George 
H. Kress, M. D., Los Angeles, Cal. 
Silver medal.—Educational leaflet for mothers. Miss Mabel Jaques, Phila- 
delphia. _ 
In medical schools lectures on hygiene have been given for many 
years. Harvard University has recently established a department 
of preventive medicine and hygiene, the object of which is to prepare 
men to serve on boards of health, state or municipal, and to investi- 
gate the causes of epidemics and methods of preventing the spread of 
epidemics. 
The training for health in the public schools appears in the form 
of various activities which overlap and reenforce one another. Med- 
ical inspection of the schools has received unusual attention within 
the past year. Louisiana has provided for the testing of the sight 
and hearing of all pupils during the first month of the school year 
(act of July 9, 1908), and a similar act in Colorado provides for the 
more general inspection of all school children, with a view to detect- 
ing and correcting physical defects. Indiana has passed an act pro- 
viding for medical inspection of schools, Ohio an act authorizing 
city school boards to employ medical inspectors and nurses in the 
public schools, and New Jersey an act requiring boards of education 
to employ competent physicians as medical inspectors. Traveling 
physicians have within the year been employed for the first time in 
the Alaska school service, whose business it is to treat the sick among 
the Eskimo and Indians and teach them the practice of hygienic 
living.
-P-A-G-E-21
  THE COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. a 
Open-air schools for tubercular children have been established in 
Boston, Brookline, Providence, New York, Pittsburg, Chicago, and 
other cities. The playground movement and the promotion of whole- 
some play among school children, together with related efforts repre- 
sented by athletic and other associations, have made marked progress. 
The comprehensive programme for the supervision and promotion 
of those school activities which have most to do with the health of 
pupils, particularly as it is carried out in the cities of New York, 
Boston, and St. Louis, has excited warm interest and admiration. 
An important contribution has been made to the literature of 
medical inspection in a volume prepared by Doctors Gulick and 
Ayres under the auspices of the Russell Sage Foundation, entitled 
“Medical Inspection of Schools.” (New York, Charities Publication 
Committee, 1908, x+276 p.) This work presents a general survey 
of the subject, brought down to the year 1908. Another publication 
relating to health in the schools may be mentioned here, namely, 
“The Daily Meals of School Children,” by Miss Caroline L. Hunt 
(Bulletin of the United States Bureau of Education, 1909, No. 3, 
62 p.), which has proved useful in suggesting to parents and teachers 
wholesome measures relative to the feeding of children of school age. 
The year has been a good one in what it has done for wholesome 
living as regards the physical life. The bearings of such wholesome 
living upon the moral character of our people are incalculable but 
none the less obvious. 
The Third International Congress on School Hygiene will be held 
at Paris, France, August 2-7, 1910. These congresses have proved 
a valuable aid in the extension of interest and information relative to 
school hygiene, and American school men will follow with unusual - 
interest the proceedings of the Paris meeting. 
TRAINING FOR VOCATION. 
4. Industrial education has continued to command attention in all 
parts of thé country. While progress in this field is still represented 
mainly by inquiries and discussions, itis a fact of no small impor- 
tance that those discussions are manifestly tending to greater clear- 
ness in our conception of the problem. What will probably rank as 
the best statement, up to this time, of the nature and conditions of 
that problem, was the presidential address of Dr. L. D. Harvey, of 
the National Education Association; presented at the Denver meeting, 
in July of this year. Doctor Harvey showed that skill in industrial 
processes must be related to a broad knowledge not only of industrial 
needs and conditions, but also of the larger demands of human life. 
His survey of the various types of industrial school was comprehen- 
sive and suggestive. 
 
-P-A-G-E-22
10 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
While the subject of industrial education was one of the leading 
topics at the meeting of the national association, it was the sole topic 
of an extremely interesting meeting of the National Society for the 
Promotion of Industrial Education, held at Atlanta in November, 
1908. In addition to the reports of proceedings of these organiza- 
tions, a considerable literature on industrial education has appeared 
in the course of the year. One number of the Annals of the Ameri- 
can Academy of Political and Social Science at Philadelphia (vol. 
33, No. 1) was devoted to a symposium upon this subject. Prof. 
Paul H. Hanus has issued a volume on Beginnings in Industrial 
Education. Important reports, bulletins, and circulars have been 
issued by the New York State Education Department, by the indus- 
trial education commissions of Massachusetts and New Jersey, and by 
the National Society for the Promotion of Industrial Education. It 
is a fact of more than ordinary significance that the American Fed- 
eration of Labor has appointed a committee to report on the subject 
of trade schools, and that this committee has arranged for a confer- 
ence upon the subject, to be held in the city of Washington in October, 
1909. The committee on industrial education of the National Asso- 
ciation of Manufacturers, which was created at the Pittsburg meeting 
of that organization in 1904, presented its fifth annual report at the 
New York meeting in May, 1909. At least four other national indus- 
trial organizations have committees dealing with the same subject. 
Certain aspects of industrial education which have commanded 
attention in the course of the year are the following: 
It becomes increasingly evident that one of the vital elements of 
the problem is the question of the relation of school training to shop 
practice or apprenticeship. Indeed there is danger that the plans and 
discussions of industrial training in schools will be “ up in the air” 
unless due account be taken of these two necessary sides of such 
training and of their relation the one to the other. A preliminary 
study of this subject was made by President Carroll D. Wright 
shortly before his death, and was published by this office. (Bureau 
of Education, Bulletin, 1908, No. 6, 116 p.) 
The special combination of shop practice with regular scholastic 
training, which was introduced two or three years ago by the Univer- 
sity of Cincinnati, is still followed with much interest. A modifica- 
tion of this plan has been carried into effect in the public schools of 
Fitchburg, Mass. The interest which the city of Fitchburg has com- 
manded during the year has been deepened by the provision which 
has now been made for model and practice schools for the teaching of 
manual arts in connection with the state normal school located in that 
city. A new building for the use of these schools is now nearing com- 
pletion. A cooperative course in preparation for the metal trades has 
been introduced into the Lewis Institute, in Chicago, for boys from
-P-A-G-E-23
  THE COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION, Be 
16 to 20 years of age. Each boy in each of the two years of this 
course spends twenty-six weeks in the shop and twenty-four weeks 
in school, receiving from his employer the school tuition fee of $50 
a year and $5 a week for the time he works in the shop. 
The subject of industrial education is found to be most intimately 
connected with that of continuation schools. This connection is 
touched upon by a number of our American writers upon this sub- 
ject, notably by Professor Hanus in his volume on “ Beginnings in 
Industrial Education,” to which reference has already been made. 
This office published a survey of the organization of continuation 
schools in this country and abroad in 1907 under the title “ The 
Continuation School in the United States,” by Mr. Arthur J. Jones 
(Bureau of Education, Bulletin, 1907, No. 1, 157 p.). A notable 
English work on this subject which has attracted much attention in 
this country is that of Dr. Michael E. Sadler, entitled “ Continuation 
Schools in England and Elsewhere; Their Place in the Educational 
System of an Industrial and Commercial State.” (Manchester, at 
the University Press, 1907, xxvi++-779 p.) 
Many diverse and often opposing interests are concerned in the 
effort to work out an American system of industrial education. All 
of these interests and the views which they have to present are to be 
given full and fair consideration. The point to be emphasized here 
is that to render such a system stable and altogether American it must 
be made a genuinely educational system. Our trade schools, in the 
long run, must be satisfactorily related to our whole system of schools. 
The only ultimate solution of the problem must necessarily be an 
educational solution. 
Agricultural education has been stimulated during the year by the 
inquiries and the report of the Commission on Country Life, ap- 
pointed by President Roosevelt. The establishment of agricultural 
high schools in different parts of the country goes steadily forward. 
Mississippi and Arkansas have made important beginnings in the 
establishment of such schools during the past year. Minnesota has 
provided for agricultural departments in the graded schools of the 
State. 
The organization of the American Home Economics Association 
at the city of Washington in December, 1908, has given a new impetus 
to one of the most important branches of our industrial education, 
that which is commonly known as domestic economy or domestic 
science. One speaker at the meeting of the National Education Asso- 
ciation at Denver proposed that the plain word “housekeeping ” be 
used to describe this branch of school training. It is doubtful 
whether any other kind of industrial education has advanced more 
rapidly than this toward definite and practicable courses of training.

12 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
STATE SYSTEMS OF EDUCATION. 
5. The most conspicuous change within the year in the field of 
state school administration is the reorganization of the Massachusetts 
Board of Education. The new board is in effect a consolidation of 
the old board, as it has been from the days of Horace Mann, with 
the more recent commission on industrial education. It is a matter 
of great significance for the development of education in the State 
that the unfortunate division of interest between representatives of 
the older system of schools and the advocates of industrial education 
is to all appearance brought to an end by this consolidation. The 
new board of nine members, appointed by the governor and con- 
firmed by the council, includes certain individuals who had been 
members of the old board and of the industrial commission. This 
board is to appoint a commissioner of education for a five-term 
period, whose salary will be fixed by the governor and council. In 
addition to the powers formerly exercised by the secretary of the 
board of education, this new commissioner “ shall have supervision 
of all educational work supported in whole or in part by the Com- 
monwealth.” He is to be assisted by two deputy commissioners, one 
of them being especially qualified to deal with industrial education. 
The reorganization went into effect on the 1st day of July, 1909. 
There is a widespread effort toward a far-reaching revision of 
state school laws. This effort, as was shown in my report for the year 
1908, has in several States taken the form of the appointment of 
educational commissions, upon whom has devolved the preliminary 
study of the proposed revision and the recommendation to the legis- 
lature of needed changes in the public statutes. Such a movement 
is still under way, as is shown by the appointment of new commis- 
sions of a similar character in the States of Connecticut, Michigan, 
Nebraska, North Dakota, Texas, West Virginia, and Vermont. Thus 
far, however, this method of dealing with the question has proved in 
a measure disappointing. Some of the commissions have issued pub- 
lications of an informing character and have made valuable sugges- 
tions as to statutory improvements. In the States of Pennsylvania, 
Illinois, and Iowa, however, in which some of the most important 
work by educational commissions has been done, the definite measures 
which they have laid before-the legislatures have failed to become 
laws. In West Virginia, on the other hand, which was a pioneer in 
this method of dealing with the problem, the labors of a state commis- 
sion eventuated in a greatly improved school code, adopted March 6, 
1908. 
It is not to. be supposed, however, that the good influence of any 
one of these state commissions is even now at an end; and in some 
instances, as in Kentucky, Maryland, and Virginia, their formal

reports are not due until the year 1910. In the States just mentioned 
and in other States of the South the educational campaign, to which 
attention was called in my report for the year 1908, is still command- 
ing the deepest interest. In Kentucky special “whirlwind cam- 
paigns” have been conducted in the shape of a large number of 
public addresses in different parts of the State, condensed into a few 
days or a few weeks at the most, the purpose of which is to concen- 
trate public attention on particular needs of the state school system. 
It would be impossible to enumerate here any considerable number of 
the interesting developments in southern education within the period 
under review. As examples, however, mention may be made of the 
employment by the State of Virginia of a state supervisor of rural 
schools, and the provision made in the State of North Carolina for 
supervision, from the office of the state superintendent of public 
instruction, of all agencies in the State which deal with the training 
of teachers. 
Two important conferences of the chief school officers of the several 
States and Territories with representatives of the Bureau of Edu- 
cation have been held within the year, one at Chicago in February, 
1909, in connection with the meeting of the department of super- 
intendence of the National Education Association, and one at Denver 
in July of this year, in connection with the general meeting of the 
National Education Association. 
In the recent history of city school administration more than ordi- 
nary interest attaches to the resignation of Dr. Edwin Gilbert Cooley, 
who for nine years was superintendent of schools of the city of 
Chicago. Superintendent Cooley has been succeeded by Mrs. Ella 
‘Flagg Young, for many years connected with the schools of Chicago, 
and for the past four years principal of the Chicago Normal School. 
PUBLICATIONS. 
6. As one studies the educational movements of the year and 
their expression in books and magazine articles the conviction is 
deepened that there has been an unusual activity in educational 
authorship, and that its course has been marked by the appearance 
of a number of really notable works. Some of these have already 
been mentioned. Attention is called here to the fact that both in 
England and in the United States a high grade of scholarly research 
has been devoted to historical studies in the field of education. 
For a single example reference may be made to the work of Mr. 
Foster Watson, which is this year represented by his volume on 
The English Grammar Schools to 1660; Their Curriculum and Prac- 
tice (Cambridge, 1908, x+548 p.). Another class of publications 
in which marked progress has been made in this country during the

year is that having to do with the actual practice of educational insti- 
tutions. Several recent volumes deal with the management of rural 
schools, of city grammar schools, of high schools, etc., while there 
are also substantial and interesting works devoted to the general 
administration of city school systems. A conspicuous example is 
The Administration of Public Education in the United States, by 
Drs. Samuel T. Dutton and David Snedden (New York, 1908, viii+- 
G01 p.). 
The twenty-seventh volume of the Documentary History of Educa- 
tion in Upper Canada, by Dr. J. George Hodgins, F. R. G. S., libra- 
rian and historiographer of the education department of Ontario 
since 1890, was completed in 1908. This history has involved immense 
research and discriminating judgment, and is,indispensable to all 
students interested in the social and educational history of Canada. 
Doctor Hodgins, who has reached the advanced age of 88 years, is 
still actively engaged in his monumental work as well as in the duties 
of his official position. 
The annual Bibliography of Education for the year 1908-9, pre- 
pared by this office, will be issued as a number of the Bulletin in the 
near future, probably appearing before the issuance of this volume of 
the annual report. It presents a summary of a significant year’s work 
on the part of the educational writers of this country, and to some 
extent of European writers. 
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. 
7. No part of the educational literature of the year has been of 
greater interest than that having to do with our colleges and univer- 
sities. Much of this literature has been in the nature of adverse criti- 
cism, although it must be admitted that such criticism has been tem- 
pered by evidence of the great respect, and indeed the affectionate 
regard, with which the most of the critics look upon the institutions 
concerning which they have written. u 
“Two distinct but converging lines of criticism,” says President 
Nicholas Murray Butler in an article in the New York Evening Post 
for September 25, 1909, “ appear to confuse the public mind as to the 
present position and value of the American college.” He continues: 
The one proceeds from those serious-minded and constructive men, within 
college service or without it, who are jealous for the college and who are 
anxious promptly to meet and to solve each new problem as it arises, and so 
to keep the work of the college as nearly perfect as may be. The other is set 
in motion by the lapping waves of that presently popular tide whose yellow 
is, as the dictionaries have it, a token or symbol of jealousy, envy, melan- 
choly. Probably, through inadvertence, the dictionaries omit to add the word 
“ ignorance.” 
President Butler’s article discusses the criticism of the college 
rather than that of the university, and deals particularly with the
-P-A-G-E-27
  THE COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. 15 
relations of the college to the secondary school, to its instruction, and 
to its discipline. 
There is a promise of a better understanding of the whole situation 
with which this criticism deals, in the fact that it has led up to utter- 
ances of marked significance by several of our leading college and 
university presidents, of which President Butler’s article is an exam- 
ple. One can not get a better idea of the discussion at its present 
stage than by a careful reading of these utterances. They are for the 
most part too compactly written to admit of much condensation. A 
few selected paragraphs, however, will be presented here as embody- 
ing some of the more striking and significant opinions which they 
have conveyed. In some instances dependence has been had on reports 
in the daily press, which must be taken as subject to correction in 
more authoritative publications. 
An article by President Arthur Twining Hadley in the New York 
Times for August 28, 1909, entitled “ College education and general 
culture,” deals in particular with the college ideal of culture as re- 
lated to technical instruction. The following passages are taken 
from this article: 
* * * There is a vigorous movement, whose strength those of us who live 
in the East do not always realize, to approximate our American system of higher 
education to the German type—to make our universities almost entirely places 
of technical training and leave to the high schools and academies the work of 
caring for general culture. 
* * * The men who have had charge of technical education have known 
what they wanted; they have had a consistent and settled policy. The men who 
have been charged with the duty of promoting general culture have not ade- 
quately defined their aim, nor have they pursued it by consistent and practical 
gneans, -* "#20 * 
But how shall we define culture? This is a question which even Matthew 
Arnold has found it no easy matter to answer. Culture is one of those complex 
things which it is easier to describe than to define. 
As a starting point for a description, I should say that culture was the oppo- 
site of absorption in the obvious. The obvious is that which gets in our way— 
the thing we can not help seeing in its full size, The cultivated man or woman 
is the one who in the various fields of life, material and social, literary and 
political, values in proper proportion the things which are unseen, or at best 
very imperfectly seen, by the less trained vision. 
* * * Tt is the characteristic of the uncultivated man that he sees the 
maple tree and ignores the landscape. It is characteristic of the man of culture 
to insist on knowing and feeling what is behind. Where others are content to 
be blinded by their emotion, [he] as instinctively asks for evidence; and in 
proportion as he is a man of true culture he weighs that evidence objectively. 
Where others see present interests large and future interests small he gets 
things in their right relations to one another. It is from this practice (often 
unconscious) of weighing evidence and getting things in their large and perma- 
nent relations that the man of real culture acquires what is. perhaps his most 
universal characteristic—a certain habit of repose. He keeps quiet while others 
are tossed to and fro; and as a result he sees the same signals and keeps the 
same course from hour to hour, while others lose their bearings. * * *  
-P-A-G-E-28
  16 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
Of the public importance of culture in this broad gense there can be no ques- 
tion at all. Without it the people will pursue small things instead of large 
ones—will be dazzled by immediate success or daunted by immediate difficulties, 
until they lose their way wholly. ‘“ Where there is no vision the people perish.” 
This is true everywhere. It is particularly true in a republic like our own, 
whose destinies depend not on the sagacity of men specially educated in the 
arts of statecraft, but upon the intelligence of the people as a whole. In Ger- 
many at the present day the training of each individual for his special walk in 
life is unequaled; but in the opinion of many the training of the nation for its 
national duties is inadequate, and would be still more inadequate than it is were 
it not for the compulsory service which every man must render to the army. 
If such a state of overspecialization should come about in America, it would, I 
think, do more harm than it does in Germany; first, because we are not likely 
under any circumstances to have compulsory military training, and, second, 
because specialization in a monarchy only interferes with the development of the 
individual, while in a republic it menaces the intelligent conduct of the whole 
body politic, A republic of specialists is a contradiction in terms. * * * 
The growing complexity of the American social organization, the increase of 
wealth and the comforts and luxuries which wealth brings with it, the develop- 
ment of games and sports of every kind, and the great stress which all branches 
of society lay upon proficiency in those sports create a set of very distracting 
conditions in college as well as out of it. They lead the student who has no 
special intellectual interest, but comes to college for the sake of general culture, 
to seek that general culture on the lines of least resistance. But if our definition 
of culture is correct, we can hardly expect to obtain it in this way. The student 
who looks only at the immediate interests of the moment is becoming uncultured 
rather than cultured—is being trained to narrow angles of vision instead of 
wide ones. * * * 
Are there any means at our command for meeting this difficulty in the future 
better than we have done in the past? I believe that there are. 
In the first place, I would have every boy who goes to college impress himself 
with the idea that he is being trained for public service in some form or 
otier,.< #.<* 2% 
In the second place, I would have the culture coursés of the American college 
so arranged as to assist the student in making an intelligent choice of a pro- 
fession. This is not so difficult as it sounds. The old theory that each student 
had a special adaptation for particular subjects and that the college had to pro- 
vide as many different courses as there were different careers in life is now 
abandoned. We are learning that there are three or four main types of mind. 
There is a scientific type, which is interested in the orderly arrangement of 
facts and which subdivides itself according as a boy is possessed of mathe- 
matical or nonmathematical tastes. There is a literary type, which is con- 
cerned not with the arrangement of facts, but with the expression and communi- 
cation of ideas. There is a practical type, which cares not so much for the 
arrangement or the expression as for the utility of the things learned. Hach 
type of mind is fitted for a certain group of professions. From the scientific 
type we make our engineers, technologists, and physicians. From the literary 
type we make our journalists, our preachers, our teachers, and our jury lawyers. 
From the practical type we make our consulting lawyers, our administrators, 
and our successful men of business. Which group of callings a boy can success- 
fully choose is determined by the mental type. Which calling within the group 
falls to his lot is, in nine cases out of ten, the result of outside circumstance. 
If you train a college boy in the methods appropriate to his profession without 
attempting to choose prematurely what his exact calling will be or to specialize

on any particular set of topics which you think he will use in after life, you 
can make a course broad enough to meet the needs of general culture and yet 
give the student ‘a large part of the interest which attaches to professional 
training. You can teach him to study things that he is not going to use by 
methods that he is going to use. The latter element provides the mental dis- 
cipline of the old curriculum; the former gives us ta breadth of the elective 
system without involving us in its weaknesses, 
President Woodrow Wilson has commanded general attention by 
several addresses in which he has recently dealt with the college and 
university problem. The following paragraphs are taken from one 
of these, bearing the title “The spirit of learning,” which was de- 
livered before the Harvard Chapter of Phi Beta Kappa on the 1st 
of July, 1909: 
Here is the key to the whole matter: The object of the college, as we have 
known and used and loved it in America, is not scholarship (except for the few, 
and for them only by way of introduction and first orientation), but the in- 
tellectual and spiritual life. Its life and discipline are meant to be a process 
of preparation, not a process of information. By the intellectual and spiritual 
life I mean the life which enables the mind to comprehend and make proper use 
of the modern world and all its opportunities. Thé object of a liberal training 
is not learning, but discipline and the enlightenment of the mind. The educated 
man is to be discovered by his point of view, by the temper of his mind, by his 
attitude toward life, and his fair way of thinking. He can see, he can discrimi- 
nate, he can combine ideas and perceive whither they lead; he has insight and 
comprehension. His mind is a practiced instrument of appreciation. He is more 
apt to contribute light than heat to a discussion, and will oftener than another 
show the power of uniting the elements of a difficult subject in a whole view; 
he has the knowledge of the world which no one can have who knows only his 
own generation or only his own task. 
What we should seek to impart in our colleges, therefore, is not so much 
learning itself as the spirit of learning. You can impart that to young men; 
and you can impart it te them in the three or four years at your disposal. It 
consists in the power to distinguish good reasoning from bad, in the power to 
digest and interpret evidence, in a habit of catholic observation and a preference 
for the nonpartisan point of view, in an addiction to clear and logical processes 
of thought and yet an instinctive desire to interpret rather than to stick in the 
letter of the reasoning, in a taste for knowledge, and a deep respect for the 
integrity of the human mind. It is citizenship of the world of knowledge, but 
not ownership of it. Scholars are the owners of its varied plots in severalty. 
* * * College is a place of initiation. Its effects are atmospheric. They 
are wrought by impression, by association, by emulation. The voices which do 
not penetrate beyond the doors of the class room are lost, are ineffectual, are 
yoid of consequence and power. No thought will obtain or live there for the 
transmission of which the prevailing atmosphere is a nonconducting medium. 
If young gentlemen get from their years at college only manliness, esprit de 
corps, a release of their social gifts, a training in give and take, a catholic taste 
in men, and the standards of true sportsmen, they have gained much, but they 
have not gained what a college should give them. It should give them insight 
into the things of the mind and of the spirit, a sense of having lived and formed 
their friendships amidst the gardens of the mind where grows the tree of 
knowledge of good and evil, a consciousness of having taken on them the vows 
9228—xp 1909—vot 1——2
-P-A-G-E-30
  18 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
of true enlightenment and of having undergone the discipline, never to be shaken 
off, of those who seek wisdom in candor, with faitHful labor and travail of 
spirit. 
These things they can not get from the class room unless the spirit of the 
class room is the spirit of the place as well and of its life; and that will never 
be until the teacher comes out of the class room and makes himself a part of 
that life. Contact, companionship, familiar intercourse is the law of life for the 
mind. The comradeships of undergraduates will never breed the spirit of 
learning. The circle must be widened. It must include the older men, the 
teachers, the men for whom life has grown more ‘serious and to whom it has 
revealed more of its meanings. So long as instruction and life do not merge 
in our ‘colleges, so long as what the undergraduates do and what they are 
taught occupy two separate, air-tight compartments in their consciousness, so 
long will the college be ineffectual. 
* * * T have no jealousy of athletics; it has put wholesome spirit into 
both the physical and the mental life of our undergraduates. There are fewer 
morbid boys in the new college which we know than there were in the old 
college which our fathers knew; and fewer prigs, too, no doubt. Athletics are 
indispensable to the normal life of young men, and are in themselves whole- 
some and delightful besides. In another atmosphere—the atmosphere of 
learning—they could be easily subordinated and assimilated. The reason they 
can not be now is that there is nothing to assimilate them, nothing by which 
they can be digested. They make their own atmosphere unmolested. There is 
no direct competition. 
The same thing may be said, for it is true, of all the other amusements and 
all the social activities of the little college world. Their name is legion; they 
are very interesting; most of them are in themselves quite innocent and legiti- 
mate; many of them are thoroughly worth while. They now engross the atten- 
tion and absorb the energies of most of the finest, most spirited, most gifted 
youngsters in the undergraduate body, men fit to be scholars and masters in 
many fields, and for whom these small things are too trivial a preparation. 
They would not do so if other things which would be certain to grip these 
very men were in competition with them, were known and spoken of and per- 
yasive in the life of the college outside the class room; but they are not. The 
field is clear for all these little activities, as it is clear for athletics. Athletics 
has no serious competitor except these amusements and petty engrossments; 
they have no serious competitor except athletics. The scholar is not in the 
game. 
* * * §o soon as the things which now dissipate and distract and dissolve 
our college life feel the things which should coordinate and regulate and inspire 
it in direct contact with them, feel their ardor and their competition, they will 
fall into their proper places, will become pleasures and cease to be occupations, 
will delight our undergraduate days, but not monopolize them. They are exag- 
gerated now because they are separated and do not exchange impulses with 
those greater things of whose presence they are sometimes hardly conscious. 
No doubt there are many ways in which this vital association may be effected, 
but all wise and successful ways will have this in common, that they will abate 
nothing of the freedom and self-government which have so quickened and puri- 
fied our colleges in these recent days of change, will have no touch of school 
surveillance in them. You can not force companionships upon undergraduates, 
if you treat them like men. You can only create the conditions, set up the 
organization, which will make them natural. * * * 
My plea, then, is this: That we now deliberately set ourselves to make a 
home for the spirit of learning; that we reorganize our colleges on the lines
-P-A-G-E-31
  THE COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. 19 
of this simple conception, that a college is not only a body of studies but a mode 
of association; that its courses are only its formal side, its contacts and con- 
tagions its realities. It must become a community of scholars and pupils—a 
free community, but a very real one, in which democracy may work its reason- 
able triumphs of accommodation, its vital processes of union. I am not sug- 
gesting that young men be dragooned into becoming scholars or tempted to be- 
come pedants, or have any artificial compulsion whatever put upon them, but 
only that they be introduced into the high society of university ideals, be ex- 
posed to the hazards of stimulating friendships, be introduced into the easy 
comradeships of the republic of letters. By this means the class room itself 
might some day come to seem a part of life. 
In this review of the discussion touching college education, as well 
as in other portions of the present volume, no attempt is made to hold 
to the hard-and-fast limit of the scholastic year which ended with the 
month of June. The more conspicuous contributions of university 
presidents to this discussion have generally appeared since the begin- 
ning of this current year. One of the latest of these, which has been 
put forth while this volume is going through the press, is too impor- 
tant to be omitted from such a symposium. Reference is made to 
the inaugural address of President Abbott Lawrence Lowell, delivered 
at Cambridge on the 6th of October, from which the following ex- 
cerpts have been taken: 
If, then, the college is passing through a transitional period, and is not to be 
absorbed between the secondary school on the one side and the professional 
school on the other, we must construct a new solidarity to replace that which is 
gone. The task before us is to frame a system which, without sacrificing indi- 
vidual variation too much, or neglecting the pursuit of different scholarly inter- 
ests, shall produce an intellectual and social cohesion, at least among large 
groups of students, and points of contact among them all. This task is not con- 
fined to any one college, although more urgent in the case of those that have 
grown the largest and have been moving most rapidly. A number of colleges 
are feeling their way toward a more definite structure, and since the problem 
before them is in many cases essentially the same, it is fortunate that they are 
assisting one another by approaching it from somewhat different directions. 
What I have to say upon the subject here is, therefore, intended mainly for the 
conditions we are called upon to face at Harvard. * * * 
The individual student ought clearly to be developed so far as possible, both 
in his strong and in his weak points, for the college ought to produce not de- 
fective specialists, but men intellectually well rounded, of wide sympathies and 
unfettered judgment. At the same time they ought to be trained to hard and 
accurate thought, and this will not come merely by surveying the elementary 
principles of many subjects. It requires a mastery of something, acquired by 
continuous application. Every student ought to know in some subject what 
the ultimate sources of opinion are and how they are handled by those who 
profess it. 
* * * Our law school lays great stress upon native ability and scholarly 
aptitude, and comparatively little upon the particular branches of learning a 
student has pursued in college. Any young man who has brains and has 
learned to use them can master the law, whatever his intellectual interest may 
have been; and the same thing is true of the curriculum in the divinity school. 
Many professors of medicine, on the other hand, feel strongly that a student 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
  20 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
should enter their school with at least a rudimentary knowledge of those 
sciences, like chemistry, biology, and physiology, which are interwoven with 
medical studies; and they appear to attach greater weight to this than to his 
natural capacity or general attainments. Now, that we have established grad- 
uate schools of engineering and business administration, we must examine this 
question carefully in the immediate future. If the college courses are strictly 
untechnical, the requirement of a small number of electives in certain subjects, 
as a condition for entering a graduate professional school, is not inconsistent 
with a liberal education. But I will acknowledge a prejudice that for a man. 
who is destined to reach the top of his profession a broad education, and a firm 
grasp of some subject lying outside of his vocation, is a vast advantage; and 
we must not forget that in substantially confining the professional schools at 
Harvard to college graduates we are aiming at the higher strata in the 
professions. 
* * * We have heard much of the benefit obtained merely by breathing 
the college atmosphere, or rubbing against the college walls. I fear the walls 
about us have little of the virtue of Aladdin’s lamp when rubbed. What we 
mean is that daily association with other young men whose minds are alert 
is in itself a large part of a liberal education. But to what extent do under- 
graduates talk over things intellectual, and especially matters brought before 
them by their courses of study? It is the ambition of every earnest teacher 
so to stimulate his pupils that they will discuss outside the class room the prob- 
lems he has presented to them. The students in the law school talk law inter- 
minably. They take a fierce pleasure in debating legal points in season and 
out. This is not wholly with a prospect of bread and butter in the years to 
come; nor because law is intrinsically more interesting than other things. 
Much must no doubt be ascribed to the skill of the faculty of the law school 
in awakening a keen competitive delight in solving legal problems; but there 
is also the vital fact that all these young men are tilling the same field. They 
have their stock of knowledge in common. Seeds cast by one of them fall into 
a congenial soil, and, like dragon’s teeth, engender an immediate combat. 
Now, no sensible man would propose to-day to set up a fixed curriculum in 
order that all undergraduates might be joint tenants of the same scholastic 
property ; but the intellectual estrangement need not be so wide as it is. There 
is no greater pleasure in mature life than hearing a specialist talk, if one has 
knowledge enough of the subject to understand him, and that is one of the 
things an educated man ought so far as possible to possess. * * * 
A discussion of the ideal college training from these three different aspects, 
the highest development of the individual student, the proper relation of the 
college to the professional school, the relation of the students to one another, 
would appear to lead in each case to the same conclusion—that the best type of 
liberal education in our complex modern world aims at producing men who know 
a little of everything, and something well. Nor, if this be taken in a rational 
rather than an extreme sense, is it impossible to achieve within the limits of 
college life * * *. 
A large college ought to give its students a wide horizon, and it fails therein 
unless it mixes them together so thoroughly that the friendships they form are 
based on natural affinities, rather than similarity of origin. Now these ties 
are formed most rapidly at the threshold of college life, and the set in which 
a man shall move is mainly determined in his freshman year. It is obviously 
desirable, therefore, that the freshmen should be thrown together more than 
they are now. 
*, * * The university touches the community at many points, and as time 
goes on it ought to serve the public through ever-increasing channels. But
-P-A-G-E-33
  
THE COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. 21 
all its activities are more or less cevnected with, and most of them are based 
upon, the college. * * * A greater solidarity in college, more earnestness 
of purpose and intellectual enthusiasm, would mean much for our nation. 
* * * When the young men shall see visions the dreams of old men will 
come true. 
It is evident from the passages quoted above that among the 
leaders of American university education there is a growing and 
surprisingly unanimous conviction regarding the directions in which 
improvement should be made in our system of higher education. It 
is to be rendered more coherent, more vital, more democratic. In 
the words of President Butler: 
The American college is under fire, no doubt. Well-directed, intelligent firing 
will do it good. It is far from perfect, but it knows its job and is working at it 
with the skill born of long and successful experience. 
No publication of the year touching our higher education has ex- 
cited more widespread interest than the series of articles by Mr. 
Edwin E. Slosson in The Independent, each of which has been de- 
voted to an entertaining and more or less critical account of a single 
institution. It is doubtless due in part to the undeniable skill with 
which these articles have been prepared, but also to the wide hold 
which the universities have gained upon the attention and the affec- 
tion of the American public, that this series has been followed with so 
much of interest. 
The issuance of Mr. Clarence Birdseye’s second volume relating to 
college administration, “ The Reorganization of Our Colleges,” has 
been followed by the incorporation of the Higher Education Associa- 
tion. This association represents the interest of the public, and par- 
ticularly of the alumni of the colleges, in the effective administration 
of the colleges and the increase of their influence for good, with par- 
ticular reference to the immediate needs of the student body. It is 
significant of the American attitude toward all educational institu- 
tions, from the lowest to the highest, that such an organization should 
be formed outside of the membership of college faculties. More and 
more the universities become institutions of the people and for the 
people. In the case of the state universities, we may add, by the 
people. 
The democratic movement in higher education has been emphasized 
during the year by the notable effort to organize in Massachusetts an 
institution which should bring courses of college instruction home to 
all communities in the State in which it may be desired—a project 
which has been referred by the legislature to the new state board of 
education for an opinion as to its advisability; by the step taken by 
the Cornell University authorities in the direction of the state-uni- 
versity form of organization, a step consisting in a modification of the 
university charter to provide for the appointment of five of its tr'us-
-P-A-G-E-34

tees by the governor of the State; and by the beginnings at the Uni- 
versity of Wisconsin of a more comprehensive and widely diffused 
system of university extension than any which has been previously 
undertaken in this country. 
Within the year the University of Wisconsin has been a center of 
public interest in a variety of ways, not the least important of which 
is the Vilas bequest to that institution, which is expected to amount to 
about $2,000,000, and to be so administered that it shall eventually 
reach a total of $20,000,000. The fact that the available income of this 
fund is to be devoted largely to research renders it no less than an 
epoch-making endowment. 
The criticism of our colleges and universities during the year has 
been freely extended to those great private foundations which are 
concerned with the encouragement of education by financial grants— 
one of the latest developments of our educational system—and par- 
ticularly to the General Education Board and the Carnegie Founda- 
tion for the Advancement of Teaching. There are undoubtedly dan- 
gers connected with these great and beneficent endowments, and in 
several portions of the country attention has been called to those 
dangers with unsparing frankness. In an address before the Na- 
tional Association of State Universities, meeting in the faculty room 
of Harvard University in the latter part of the week of President 
Lowell’s inauguration, President J. G. Schurman of Cornell Univer- 
sity, the presiding officer of the association, stated the case as follows: 
An irresponsible, self-perpetuating board, whose business is to dispense money, 
necessarily tends to look at every question from the pecuniary point of view; 
it wants its money’s worth; it demands immediate and tangible results. Will 
not its large powers and enormous influence in relation to the institutions 
dependent upon it tend to develop in it an attitude of patronage and a habit of 
meddling? 
I make no exception even of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement 
of Teaching, to which Mr. Carnegie has given such large endowment for the pen- 
sioning of professors in the colleges, technical schools, and universities of the 
United States and Canada. And I certainly speak with no prejudice, as I 
regard that endowment as the best thing any benefactor hds ever done for 
higher education in America, and I have myself the honor of being one of the 
trustees. But I look with concern and anxiety on the influence of such corpo- 
rations on the free and independent life of our institutions of learning and 
research. 
So clear and fearless a recognition of the dangers and limitations of 
great general and private endowments for education, on the part of 
those directly concerned with the administration of such endowments, 
will go far to reassure our people as to the general usefulness and 
safety of those foundations under judicious management. 
The year has been marked by an unusual number of notable changes 
in the personnel of our higher education. Mention may be made here 
of the death of Daniel Coit Gilman, who, as president of Johns Hop-
-P-A-G-E-35

kins University, was the pioneer of organized graduate study in this 
country; the retirement of President Charles W. Eliot, of Harvard 
University, whose educational leadership, covering a period of forty 
years, has influenced all grades of instruction in America from the 
primary school to the schools of graduate and professional studies; 
and the resignation of the foremost leader of state university educa- 
tion of the past forty years, President James Burrill Angell, of the 
University of Michigan. President Cyrus Northrop, of the Univer- 
sity of Minnesota, whose influence in his State through the long term 
of his service has been powerful and uplifting, has also resigned his 
high position. Many other changes of like significance and impor- 
tance are mentioned in this volume in the chapter on current topics. 
INTERNATIONAL AND FOREIGN. 
8. Every year shows more clearly that the interests and the prob- 
Jems of education are in the main common to all civilized nations. 
Even those who have followed closely the trend of education in dif- 
ferent parts of the world are often surprised with new illustrations 
of this fact. In all culture lands, broadly speaking, the different 
types and grades of education are coming into closer union, oppor- 
tunities for advancement from the lowest schools to the higher are 
increased, the schools are made to concern themselves with prepara- 
tion for a wider range of occupation in life, and a greater number of 
processes closely related to education are brought into organic con- 
nection with educational institutions. The recognition of education 
as a common interest has gone forward during the past year, finding 
expression in numerous international exchanges. Of these mention 
may be made here of but one, which is in a measure typical. The 
Latin-American countries have in recent years held a series of 
scientific congresses. This series culminated in a Pan-American 
Scientific Congress, which was held at Santiago, Chili, in December 
last. This country accepted the invitation to send delegates and was 
represented by a strong body of men, who exercised a marked influ- 
ence upon the deliberations of the gathering. Their meeting with 
the leaders of South American thought was extremely promising of 
closer relations in the future between this country and its Latin- 
American neighbors. Steps were taken toward the convening of a 
second congress of a similar character in the year 1912 at the city of 
Washington. 
The following notes upon education in a number of foreign coun- 
tries have been prepared by specialists in this office: 
THE UNITED KINGDOM, 
In a broad survey of educational movements the most impressive 
feature of progress in Great Britain is the extension of the, state sys- 
tems in two directions—the one social, the other scholastic. Under
-P-A-G-E-36
24 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
the first head may be included those services which pertain to the 
physical and moral well-being of the children of the poorer classes. 
The Scotch law authorizes school boards to take practical measures 
for the protection of children from neglect and abuse and for the 
supply of food and clothing at public cost to needy children. School 
boards are also empowered to defray the expenses of agencies for col- 
lecting and distributing information as to employments open to chil- 
dren on leaving school. In these respects the Scotch law is even more 
comprehensive and explicit than the “Education (administrative 
provisions) Act, England,” passed in 1907. The latter is reenforced 
by the “ Children Act ” passed during the year, which deals in a com- 
prehensive manner with problems of child life and juvenile offenders. 
Its important contribution to social welfare is the provision for the 
establishment of juvenile courts in the principal centers of England. 
The Scotch law referred to above, like the earlier law for England, 
makes the establishment of the service of medical inspection of 
schools mandatory upon the local education authorities. In these 
social-welfare services the Government is following the lead of the 
chief cities of England and Scotland, but the action of the supreme 
authority not only gives new impetus to municipal and private 
agencies engaged in the work, but makes the service as wide as the 
nation itself. 
It is significant that the measures above referred to have been 
adopted for economic reasons rather than altogether from prompt- 
ings of benevolence. It is this conception that has led to recent ex- 
haustive investigations of the conditions of school attendance in Eng- 
land as related to the social conditions and the enforced labor of chil- 
dren of school age. These investigations, of which somewhat ex- 
tended accounts are given in the chapter on Education in Great 
Britain and Ireland, have brought the child population of England 
under a survey even more searching than that accomplished when the 
education law of 1870 was passed. The reports of the committees 
appointed for the work show, both by facts and by authoritative 
opinions, that enforced juvenile labor under present industrial condi- 
tions stunts the individual child and is a waste of national force, 
measured solely by the industrial outcome. 
The most significant fact in respect to the scholastic extension of 
the system of education here considered is the authority conferred by 
the Scotch law upon school boards to require the attendance at con- 
tinuation classes, according to their discretion, of young people be- 
tween the ages of 14 and 17 years. The right is also reserved to the 
education department to enforce upon school boards the provision of 
continuation classes suited to local needs. 
The extension of government authority to the sphere of secondary 
education has aroused critical scrutiny and fruitful discussion in
-P-A-G-E-37
THE COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. 25 
England of measures pertaining to this new field of action. During 
the year the board of education has issued important regulations and 
circulars for secondary schools, affecting, particularly, the courses of 
study. As a consequence, the subject of secondary curricula has 
engaged the attention of all associations and specialists in this de- 
partment of education. The wide-reaching importance of this class 
of investigations is illustrated by a report on science teaching in 
public (endowed) schools, published by the board of education, and 
embodying the results of an investigation conducted by the associa- 
tion of science masters connected with the said schools acting in con- 
sultation with officials of the board. 
The importance of the teaching profession has been emphasized 
during the year by the regulations of the English board of education 
for the staffing of schools, and by the clauses of the Scotch law giving 
teachers greater security of tenure and the prospect of a fair retiring 
allowance; and also by regulations for the preliminary training of 
intending teachers, which provide, in fact, for the rapid elimination 
of the pupil teacher from the service. 
In the record of university movements the year has been eventful 
by reason of the reforms proposed by Lord Curzon, in his capacity 
as chancellor of Oxford, and by the initial measures for the organiza- 
tion of the two universities for Ireland in accordance with the recent 
law. Great results are eventually looked for through the influence 
of these two centers of learning in the work of unifying the public 
agencies of education in Ireland. Such action, which is confidently 
anticipated, will, it is believed, develop resources already available 
for education in Ireland, and bring the standard of popular education 
up to the level of the other divisions of the United Kingdom. 
CENTRAL EUROPE, 
There is one feature of the present movement in behalf of improve- 
ment of public education in central Europe which makes it more re- 
markable than like efforts of former decades. It is a movement of 
large dimensions; it is, as one has said, “ grossziigig.” Accordingly, 
we observe progress in legislation concerning public education, enor- 
mously increased expenditures for schools, new conceptions as 
to girls’ schools, continuation schools, auxiliary schools, etc., new 
foundations for higher education, the extension of compulsory at- 
tendance, and the establishment of schools for vocational education. 
The imperial statistical office now issues reports of school attend- 
ance and expenditures for all of the States of Germany, as the Aus- 
trian central commission now does for all of the Austrian crown 
lands, and as the Swiss yearbook has done for many years for all of 
the cantons of the federation. It has recently made a comparison of 
the school and other expenditures of the twenty-six States that consti- 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
  26 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
tute the German Empire. This showing is naturally a better one 
than is commonly supposed, inasmuch as the expenditures of the cen- 
tral governments for public education in Germany are often com- — 
pared with those of other lands, in disregard of provincial and mu- 
nicipal expenditures for school purposes. The same central author- 
ity in Germany, giving a résumé of school attendance in all of the 
lower schools and other related matters, reports that the number of 
pupils in the elementary schools (ages 6 to 14) was 9,779,356, or 94 
per cent of all children of school age, about 6 per cent being taught 
in middle, secondary, and ‘private schools. The reports summarized 
relate chiefly to the year 1906. Since 1901 the daily attendance shows 
an increase of 9.1 per cent. During the same period the number of 
men teachers increased 10.6 per cent, that of women teachers 30.5 per 
cent. The annual cost per pupil in public elementary schools in- 
creased from $11.20 in 1901 to $12.86 in 1906, according to the latest 
quinquennial report. The average number of pupils to each teacher 
in 1906 was 58. 
Especially worthy of note is the legislative activity shown in Prussia, 
Wiirttemberg, Oldenburg, Saxony, Saxe-Weimar, and other States. 
Where formerly the administration and supervision of schools was 
mainly based on ministerial orders, attempts are now made to pass 
Jaws which embody the modern spirit and the latest pedagogical 
experience. In particular, legislative bodies have taken cognizance 
of the necessity of giving the schools professional supervision in 
cities together with the related question of denominational instruc- 
tion. Teachers’ salaries also have been the subject of legislative enact- 
ment in several States of Germany. The new salary law in Prus- 
sia, though not altogther satisfactory to the teachers, is a great 
step in advance. Social games on playgrounds and school gardens, 
parents’ meetings, school savings banks, school kitchens, and manual 
training halls are among the newer interests which center in the school 
system. School physicians give attention to diseased pupils. In so 
doing they have entered upon the establishment of forest schools and 
open-air colonies for sickly children. Elsewhere in this report are 
given accounts of schools for weak-minded children, of the number 
of cripples, of the care of dependent and criminally inclined children, 
of the feeding of hungry school children, of the cost of caring for 
children’s teeth, and other humanitarian interests. 
Steps have been taken toward enlarging the usefulness of continua- 
tion (day and evening) schools. There are three kinds of continua- 
tion school in Germany—industrial, commercial, and agricultural. 
These schools are subsidized by nearly all of the States. In many 
States attendance is obligatory, but there is still a large number of 
voluntary schools of this kind. While many are directly vocational, 
the greater number of them are vocational only in part.

THE COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. 27 
Secondary and higher institutions of learning are not falling 
behind in the general forward movement. While the schools without 
Latin and Greek are increasing rapidly, the classical schools are by 
no means decreasing. New foundations, such as the Colonial Institute 
at Hamburg, the Commercial University at Cologne, the Poly- 
technicum at Dantzig, show that a variety of institution is needed to 
satisfy the varied needs and wishes of the people. Sharp differences 
of opinion, such as characterize all living institutions, appear in the 
resolutions of professors recently passed at a meeting at Jena, con- 
cerning the liberty to teach; and in the rejection of a petition for the 
establishment of chairs of pedagogy in Bavaria on the ground “ that 
pedagogy as a university discipline would presuppose universal 
knowledge in its representative, which is manifestly an impossibility.” 
SPANISH AMERICA, 
The modernizing tendency in education in Spanish South America, 
which was noticed somewhat fully in the last report, is further mani- 
fested in the reports which have reached this bureau within the past 
year. The report of the Chilean minister of public instruction shows 
that more and more attention is now given to practical branches of 
instruction in the schools, as well as in the higher institutions. In 
the latter, for example, special attention is to be paid to the chemistry 
and technology of saltpeter, in which Chile is remarkably rich; while 
manual training has been introduced into the schools, and the spirit 
of the instruction generally, as revealed in the report, is inspired by a 
desire and determination to prepare the present rising generation in 
Chile for an active business life. 
The same observation applies to the report of the minister of public 
instruction of Guatemala, the programmes of instruction which he pub- 
lishes all showing a decided preponderance of the scientific, technical, 
and commercial over the literary branches. The minister takes 
occasion to insist upon the importance of a good knowledge of Eng- 
lish, in view of the increased intercourse which the new railway will 
open with English-speaking people. Teachers in the public schools 
are required to know and teach English. This is one of the many 
indications that English is becoming the principal international 
language of the commercial world. 
The Fifth Pan-American Medical Congress met at Guatemala on 
the 6th of August, 1908. It is interesting to note that a number of 
the papers presented were from physicians in all parts of the United 
States, showing that the interest in the congress was widespread 
among the American medical profession. 
Prof. L. S. Rowe, of the University of Pennsylvania, has made 
studies of the condition of education in South American countries 
during visits to the various Spanish Republics and has given the  
-P-A-G-E-40
  28 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
results of some of his observations in a valuable paper which is pub- 
lished in this report under the title “ Educational progress in the 
Argentine Republic and Chile.” 
THE BUREAU OF EDUCATION. 
9. The Bureau of Education has now been removed from the rented 
building at the corner of Eighth and G streets, which it had occupied 
for a generation or more, to somewhat larger and much more comfort- 
able quarters in the old Post-Office Department building, between 
Seventh and Eighth and E and F streets northwest. Mr. Lewis A. 
Kalbach, who had served as clerk to the commissioner, has been made 
chief clerk of the bureau; Prof. James E. McClintock, of the Univer- 
sity of Maine, has been appointed specialist in land-grant college 
statistics, his principal work having to do with the relations of this 
office with the colleges of agriculture and mechanic arts; Dr. Harlan 
Updegraff, chief of the Alaska division, has been appointed collector 
and compiler of statistics, succeeding Mr. W. Dawson Johnston, who 
has become librarian of Columbia University. These two specialists 
are to spend a portion of their time in the field, with a view to becom- 
ing intimately acquainted with such needs as the bureau may properly 
serve. Dr. John D. Wolcott has been made acting librarian. 
An inventory of the library, the first of which we have record, was 
taken on the occasion of its removal to the new quarters. It was 
found to contain 47,230 bound volumes and approximately 80,000 
pieces of unbound material. 
Arrangements have been made with the Bureau of the Census for 
the collection, by its experts in the field, of financial statistics of the 
school systems of the larger cities. The statistical blank used by the 
Census Office for the purpose has been prepared by that office and the 
Bureau of Education in cooperation, and will be used jointly by the 
two offices. Copies will be furnished this year by the Bureau of 
Education to cities that can not be reached by the census agents. 
Mr. William T. Lopp, who has served as district superintendent 
of schools in Alaska, has been appointed superintendent of the educa- 
tion of natives of Alaska, including the reindeer industry. The 
bureau maintained 69 United States public schools in Alaska during 
the year 1908-9, with 89 teachers and an enrollment of 3,809 pupils. 
Nine physicians have been employed in widely scattered localities, 
whose chief duties are to introduce sanitary methods of living, to 
collect vital statistics regarding the natives, and to furnish medical 
relief. In communities having no physicians, the teachers of 29 of 
the United States public schools administer nonprofessional aid in 
sickness, for which purpose they are furnished with medical supplies 
and text-books. The schools for natives of Alaska are now generally 
equipped for instruction in the industries and in domestic economy. 
 
-P-A-G-E-41
  THE COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. 29 
The correspondence division, of which Mr. Lovick Pierce is chief, 
has distributed during the year 143,315 copies of the publications of 
this office. Provision was made by the last Congress for the employ- 
ment of an editor of the bureau’s publications. A civil-service exami- 
nation will be held in the near future for the purpose of filling this 
position. 
The topics which have been touched upon above and many others 
are treated more at length in the following chapters. In spite of 
the foresight which has been exercised and the pains taken in the 
preparation of these chapters, some portions have necessarily been 
prepared in haste. In some instances it has been found necessary to 
depend upon second-hand materials, and subjects of importance have 
been passed over because reliable information of any kind has as yet 
failed to reach this office. We must, accordingly, still ask indulgence 
for possible inaccuracies and omissions. It is believed that the infor- 
mation here presented, which is for the most part drawn from official 
publications, will be found to be substantially correct. The reor- 
ganization of such a report, however, with a view to making it fairly 
represent the most recent tendencies and developments, is not a thing 
to be fully accomplished in a year or even in two. Criticism of both 
the methods and the materials of this report is invited, and it is confi- 
dently believed that that of the next year will show as great an 
improvement over the volume here presented as it is believed this 
report will show in comparison with that of a year ago. 
All of which is respectfully submitted.

GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD. 
The activities of this board during the current year are in some 
degree indicated by the following statement, giving a general view 
of the principal, income, and expenditure of the different funds under 
the jurisdiction of the board for the year ending June 30, 1909: 
(1) John D. Rockefeller special fund (subject to order of Mr. 
Rockefeller) —The principal of this fund amounted to $16,955,841. 
The income (including balance and amount accrued but not yet paid) 
was $959,714. Gifts to institutions were: University of Chicago, 
$265,739; Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, $213,125. 
(2) John D. Rockefeller general fund.—Principal: Original gift,

The above statement shows that on June 30, 1909, the principal of 
the three larger funds under the control of that board, known as the 
“special,” the “general,” and the “ foundation” fund, aggregated 
$38,537,066.66, a net increase of $223,966.37 over the preceding year. 
The available income account of the three funds amounted to 
$3,825,489.21. Appropriations aggregating $746,234.69 were made 
to 23 universities and colleges in sums ranging from $1,300 to 
$100,000. From the income, investments were made and added to 
the capital to the amount of $1,206,197.11. After expenses were paid 
‘there were balances on hand aggregating about $500,000. 
The latest gift of Mr. Rockefeller, amounting to $10,000,000, was 
made July 7, 1909, subsequent to the close of the fiscal year of the 
board, and consequently is not included in the above statement. 
CARNEGIE FOUNDATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF TEACHING. 
Two new features were incorporated in the rules of the Carnegie 
Foundation during the year covered by the Third Annual Report of 
President Pritchett (Oct. 1, 1907—-Sept. 30, 1908), namely: The maxi- 
mum amount of a retiring allowance was raised from $3,000 to 
$4,000 and a certain provision was made for widows’ pensions by 
the adoption of the following rule: 
Any person who has been for ten years the wife of a professor either in 
receipt of a pension or entitled to receive one shall receive during her widowhood 
one-half of the allowance to which her husband was entitled. 
Pensions to widows had previously been only permissory. The 
executive committee have ruled that a widow’s pension ceases upon 
remarriage. 
During the year 78 names were added to the retiring-allowance 
roll, at a total cost of $113,765. Of these 39 were professors in 
accepted institutions and 24 in institutions not on the accepted list, 
while 15 were widows of professors. Thirteen persons in the retired  
-P-A-G-E-48
  36 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
list died during the year and 2 temporary allowances were discon- 
tinued, so that the total addition to the list was 63 names. 
The total number of retiring allowances in force September 30, 
1908, was 211, as follows: One hundred and sixteen to professors in 
accepted institutions, 66 to professors not in accepted institutions, 
and 29 to widows. The increase for the year was 63. The total 
grant in force was $303,505, being greater by $101,360 than at the 
close of the preceding year. 
The geographical distribution of retiring allowances was as fol- 
lows: North Atlantic division, 104; South Atlantic division, 24; 
South Central division, 20; North Central division, 51; Western 
division, 5; Canada, 5; Newfoundland, 2. 
Seven institutions were admitted to the privileges of the retiring 
allowance system during the year, as follows: Bowdoin College, the 
Central University of Kentucky, Drake University, Drury College, 
Franklin College, Rose Polytechnic Institute, and the University of 
Cincinnati. 
Upon the subject of the exchange of teachers between Prussia and 
the United States President Pritchett has to remark: 
In response to a request from the minister of instruction of Prussia, the 
trustees voted at their meeting on November 20, 1907, to authorize the president 
of the foundation to act as the agency in America for an exchange of teachers 
of English between the United States and Prussia. * * * 
Although the exchange has scarcely more than begun, several matters have 
developed respecting it to which it seems desirable to call attention. 
In Prussia a very large number of well-qualified teachers applied for the 
opportunity to exchange, and a large number of gymnasia asked for the assign- 
ment of American teachers. 
In the United States a considerable number of teachers applied, nearly all 
of whom were from the Central West. Very few applications came from New 
England, New York, or the Atlantic States, a result somewhat disappointing. 
This, however, was not so disconcerting as the lack of high schools or under- 
graduate colleges desiring to take, at the small expense involved, a German 
teacher. This arose, I am inclined to believe, from a misconception of the plan 
StRGIf Ros BGS : 
The trustees may have noted that the inauguration of this exchange pre- 
cipitated in English and German periodicals an amusing discussion as to 
whether Americans ought to be chosen to teach the English language. The 
fitness of Americans to teach English was warmly defended by Professor 
Brandl and other German university professors who had visited the United 
States. 
To the absence of uniformity in college financial reports is chiefly 
due the difficulty the foundation has met with in presenting com- 
parative college statistics. Absolute uniformity, the president says, 
is probably impossible, and perhaps undesirable, but he gives a form 
of financial statement containing the more simple and fundamental 
items in which the public is interested and which are needed in the 
study of educational administration, to be incorporated in the finan-
-P-A-G-E-49
EDUCATIONAL BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. 37 
cial report of each institution, whatever form such report might in 
other respects take. 
The question of the admission of tax-supported and state-con- 
trolled institutions to the accepted list had been constantly before the 
* trustees during the two years of the foundation’s administration. 
On the ground of established public policy it seemed altogether 
desirable that retiring allowances should be established in tax- 
supported colleges and universities by the States which governed 
and supported them. On the other hand, considering the interests 
of education, it appeared to be a misfortune to divide the colleges 
and universities of the country into two groups separated by the line 
of state support. President Pritchett disposed of the argument 
respecting the conflicting claims of a divided allegiance between the 
state college and the foundation by stating that no such case could 
arise. 
Once a college has been admitted to the privileges of the retiring allowance 
system, its professors receive their retiring allowances through the college 
exactly as they receive their salaries. They have no occasion to know the 
foundation in the matter. 
Tn view of all the considerations, Mr. Carnegie made to the trustees 
of the foundation the offer contained in the following letter ad- 
dressed to the president of the foundation and dated March 31, 1908: 
Dear Sir: Your favor of to-day informs me of the desire of the professors 
of state universities to be embraced in the pension fund, as shown by a resolu- 
tion unanimously adopted by their national association. 
In my letter of April 16, 1905, handing over the fund to my trustees, the fol- 
lowing occurs: “We have, however, to recognize that state and colonial goy- 
ernments which have established or mainly supported universities, colleges, or 
schools may prefer that their relations shall remain exclusively with the State. 
I can not, therefore, presume to include them.” 
I beg now to say that should the governing boards of any state universities 
apply for participation in the fund and the legislature and governor of the 
State approve such application, it will give me great pleasure to increase the 
‘fund to the extent necessary to admit them. I understand from you that if 
all the state universities should apply and be admitted five millions more of 
5 per cent bonds would be required, making the fund $15,000,000 in all. 
From the numerous letters I have received from pensioners and their wives 
and the warm approval of the press and the public, I am satisfied that this 
fund is, and must be for all time, productive of lasting good, not only to the 
recipients, but to the cause of higher education. 
Most grateful am I to be privileged as trustee of this wealth to devote it to 
such use. 
Truly, yours, ANDREW CARNEGIE. 
At a special meeting, held May 7, 1908, the trustees voted unani- 
mously to accept the offer of Mr. Carnegie to supply the $5,000,000 of 
additional endowment.

THE CARNEGIE FOUNDATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF TEACHING AND 
THE GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY. 
The following letter, reprinted from Science (June 18, 1909), was 
addressed by the president of the Carnegie Foundation for the 
Advancement of Teaching to the president of the George Washington 
University : 
June 4, 1909. 
President CHARLES W. NEEDHAM, 
The George Washington University, Washington, D. 0. 
Dear Sir: I am directed by the executive committee of the Carnegie Founda- 
tion for the Advancement of Teaching to send to you, as president of the George 
Washingon University, the following communication : 
The George Washington University reported to the foundation a productive 
endowment of $219,832.96 as of date August 21, 1907. In the financial state- 
ment submitted some time since it reported as of date October 3, 1908, a pro- 
ductive endowment of $123,500. 
The rules of the Carnegie Foundation require that an institution, to be en- 
titled to the privileges of the retiring-allowance system, must have a productive 
endowment of not less than $200,000. This proviso was made because experi- 
ence has proved that no college can maintain fair educational standards without 
adequate endowment. 
The examination which I have just caused to be made of the George Washing- 
ton University shows that its announced standards of admission to the various 
Schools are not enforced. 
In the college division of the university regular students are admitted with 
reasonable regard to the stated admission requirements, but of the total enroll- 
ment more than one-third are special students. The value of the A. B. degree, 
however, is seriously lowered by the lax administration of the college of political 
sciences and the division of education, to which admission is granted with little 
regard to the published entrance requirements. The law school announces a 
four-year high-school education as a prerequisite for admission, but does not 
enforce it. Similarly in the medical school the announced requirements for 
admission have been repeatedly evaded. If the entrance requirements to this 
school were actually enforced, the enrollment would be so greatly reduced that 
the department could not continue—a result, I may add, entirely in the interest 
of medical education, since the District of Columbia and the region about it 
are oversupplied not only with physicians, but with weak medical schools. 
The executive committee feels compelled also to protest against the extraordi- 
nary action of the institution in forcibly retiring two professors, both of whom 
are in the prime of their active teaching, on the ground that the institution 
needs to save money by the retiring-allowance system, but it is entirely contrary 
to the spirit in which this foundation was conceived and is a blow at academic 
dignity and academic freedom. 
The committee further calls your attention to the extract from the rules for 
the admission of institutions: ‘‘ The trustees of the Carnegie Foundation for the 
Advancement of Teaching reserve the right to discontinue the privilege of par- 
ticipation in the system of retiring allowances of the foundation whenever, in
-P-A-G-E-51
  
EDUCATIONAL BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. 89 
the judgment of the trustees, an institution ceases to conform to the regulations 
maintained by the trustees. Such withdrawal shall not, however, result in the 
discontinuance of retiring allowance already granted.” 
The executive committee, by virtue of the authority conferred upon it under 
the by-laws, in view of the conditions existing in the George Washington Uni- 
versity referred to above, conditions which are entirely out of harmony with 
the educational ideals for which the foundation stands, informs you with great 
regret that the relation of the George Washington University as an accepted 
institution is terminated with this date. 
Very truly, yours, Henry S. Pritcuert, 
President. 
The foregoing letter called forth a detailed statement by President 
Needham of the plans and work of the George Washington Univer- 
sity, which was published in Science, June 25, 1909. Those portions 
of the statement that deal more directly with the points raised by 
President Pritchett are as follows: 
In regard to the pensioning of teachers, so far as I understand it, it has 
always been construed where a pension system existed that when a professor 
has become entitled to a pension, either by length of service or by age limit, 
he has the right to retire voluntarily at any time, and the university has the 
equal right to retire him when for any cause it seems expedient to do so. 
In the recent action it became necessary to reduce the expenses about $25,000 
and to distribute that retrenchment among each of the departments of the 
university. Of necessity the services of some of the teachers had to be dis- 
pensed with, and in selecting the ones to be retained, all things being equal, 
it was natural to retain those who were thoroughly in harmony with the 
general plans and development of the university. 
The action of the Carnegie Foundation in assuming that the university had 
no option but could retire only those eligible who voluntarily sought retire- 
ment seems to be contrary to the usual construction of pension systems. Waiv- 
ing this point, however, their action in our case was hasty and arbitrary. * * * 
The productive investments in 1900 were $223,509.65. In 1908 they were 
$127,740.91. This change in the productive assets was caused by the drain 
upon the funds occasioned by the increase in the cost of maintaining the uni- 
versity. The contributions toward the current expenses were insufficient to 
meet the annual deficit, and thus funds which were properly applicable had 
to be used to pay the salaries and current expenses or close the doors to 
progress. 
ACTION OF STATE LEGISLATURES REGARDING CARNEGIE PENSIONS. 
A joint resolution of 1909 of the Idaho legislature approves the 
application of the regents to have the University of Idaho placed 
upon the accepted list of institutions eligible to receive the benefits 
of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. 
Act No. 241 of the legislature of South Carolina, approved March 
1, 1909, authorizes the trustees of all institutions of higher learning 
supported in whole or in part by the State of South Carolina to se- 
cure the benefits of the retiring funds for their teachers.  
-P-A-G-E-52
  40 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
A joint resolution of the legislature of Vermont, approved Janu- 
ary 15, 1909, authorizes and instructs the board of trustees of the 
University of Vermont and State Agricultural College to accept the 
benefits of the retiring fund-of the Carnegie Foundation for the Ad- 
vancement of Teaching. 
Resolutions to similar effect were passed by the legislatures of a 
number of other States, including California, Illinois, Massachusetts, 
Michigan, and New Hampshire. 
THE RUSSELL SAGE FOUNDATION. 
In 1907 Mrs. Russell Sage, of New York City, gave to-a board of 
trustees the sum of $10,000,000 for the improvement of social and 
living conditions in the United States of America. The scope of the 
foundation as defined by the trustees at one of their earliest meetings 
is as follows: 
(a) The foundation will not attempt to relieve individual or family need. 
Its function is to eradicate so far as possible the causes of poverty and igno- 
rance, rather than to relieve the sufferings of those who are poor or ignorant. 
Not that it is not a noble work to relieve suffering, however caused, but that 
if the foundation should attempt to relieve such suffering there would be noth- 
ing left with which to perform the higher function of trying to prevent its 
existence. There is another equally cogent reason for this conclusion. The 
relief of individual need is not one of the “larger and more difficult problems.” 
It is a duty which every one of us who is more prosperous owes to our less 
prosperous neighbor. Every neighborhood should relieve its own cases of 
individual need for its own sake, and every neighborhood is measurably meet- 
ing this obligation. The sources of neighborly charity would be dried up if 
such needs were supplied from without. 
(b) The sphere of higher education, that served by our universities and col- 
leges, is not within the scope of the foundation. It is sufficiently cared for by 
the General Education Board. Not so, however, elementary education. of the 
kind that directly affects social and living conditions, e. g., industrial educa- 
tion, education in the household arts, training of charity workers, ete. 
(c) Aid to churches for church purposes, whatever ‘their denomination, is 
not within the scope of the foundation. 
Among the propagandist movements to which the foundation has 
contributed both direction and financial support are the following: 
Prevention of tuberculosis; playground extension; care of children; 
children’s school gardens; charity organization extension; and pre- 
vention of blindness. Among other work that has been fostered by 
the foundation are the following: A study of the causes of slow 
progress among school children; the schools in Boston, New York, 
Chicago, and St. Louis have been given the means to establish de- 
partments for social investigation. Among the publications issued 
by the foundation are First Steps in Organizing Playgrounds, by 
Lee F. Hanmer; The Field Day and Play Picnic for Country Chil- 
dren, by Myron T. Scudder; Medical Inspection of Schools, by Luther 
H. Gulick and Leonard P. Ayres.

EDUCATIONAL BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. 41 
FEDERAL COMMISSION ON COUNTRY LIFE. 
On August 10, 1908, the President of the United States appointed 
a commission of five members, afterwards increased to seven mem- 
bers, to investigate and report to him “upon the present condition 
of country life, upon what means are now available for supplying the 
deficiencies which exist, and upon the best methods of organized per- 
manent effort in investigation and actual work” along the lines of 
betterment of rural conditions. The field of inquiry covered by the 
commission included the general social, economic, sanitary, educa- 
tional, and labor conditions of the open country. The investigation 
was conducted by means of circular letters of inquiry sent to about 
550,000 persons, and through public hearings held by the commission 
at thirty places throughout the United States. The commission 
rendered its report to the President on January 23, 1909, who trans- 
mitted it to Congress on February 9, 1909. It was printed as Senate 
Document No. 705, Sixtieth Congress, second session. 
Among the reasons ascribed by the commission for the lack of a 
highly organized rural society is a “ lack of good training for country 
life in the schools.” Respecting this phase of the investigation the 
commission reports as follows: 
The subject of paramount importance in our correspondence and in the hear- 
ings is education. In every part of the United States there seems to be one 
mind, on the part of those capable of judging, on the necessity of redirecting 
the rural schools. There is no such unanimity on any other subject. It is 
remarkable with what similarity of phrase the subject has been discussed in all 
parts of the country before the commission. Everywhere there is a demand that 
education have relation to living, that the schools should express the daily life, 
and that in the rural districts they should educate by means of agriculture and 
country life subjects. It is recognized that all difficulties resolve themselves 
in the end into a question of education. 
The schools are held to be largely responsible for ineffective farming, lack 
of ideals, and the drift to town. This is not because the rural schools, as a 
whole, are declining, but because they are in a state of arrested development and 
have not yet put themselves in consonance with all the recently changed condi- 
tions of life. The very forces that have built up the city and town school 
have caused the neglect of the country school. It is probable that the farming 
population will willingly support better schools as soon as it becomes convinced 
that the schools will really be changed in such a way as to teach persons how 
to live. 
The country communities are in need of social centers—places where persons 
may naturally meet, and where a real neighborhood interest exists. There is 
difference of opinion as to where this center should be, some persons thinking 
it should be in the town or village, others the library, others the church or school 
or grange hall. It is probable that more than one social center should develop 
in large and prosperous communities. Inasmuch as the school is supported by 
public funds, and is therefore an institution connected with the government of 
the community, it should form a natural organic center. If the school develops 
such a center, it must concern itself directly with the interests of the people. 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
   
        42 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
It is difficult to make people understand what this really means, for school- 
teaching is burdened with tradition. The school must express the best coopera- 
tion of all social and economic forces that make for the welfare of the com- 
munity. Merely to add new studies will not meet the need, although it may 
break the ground for new ideas. The school must be fundamentally redirected, 
until it becomes a new kind of institution. This will require that the teacher 
himself be a part of the community and not a migratory factor. 
The feeling that agriculture must color the work of rural public schools is 
beginning to express itself in the interest in nature study, in the introduction of 
classes in agriculture in high schools and elsewhere, and in the establishment of 
separate or special schools to teach farm and home subjects. These agencies 
will help to bring about the complete reconstruction of which we have been 
speaking. It is specially important that we make the most of the existing pub- 
lic-school system, for it is this very system that should serve the real needs of 
the people. The real needs of the people are not alone the arts by which they 
make a living, but the whole range of their customary activities. As the home 
is the center of our civilization, so the home subjects should be the center of 
every school, 
The most necessary thing now to be done for public-school education in terms 
of country life is to arouse all the people to the necessity of such education, to 
coordinate the forces that are beginning to operate, and to project the work 
beyond the schools for youth into continuation schools for adults. The schools 
must represent and express the community in which they stand, although, of 
course, they should not be confined to the community. They should teach health 
and sanitation, even if it is necessary to modify the customary teaching of 
physiology. The teaching should be visual, direct, and applicable. Of course 
the whole tendency of the schools will be ethical if they teach the vital subjects 
truthfully ; but particular care should be taken that they stand for the morals 
of the pupils and of the communities. 
We find a general demand for federal encouragement in educational propa- 
ganda to be in some way cooperative with the States. The people realize that 
the incubus of ignorance and inertia is so heavy and so widespread as to con- 
stitute a national danger, and that it should be removed as rapidly as possible. 
It will be increasingly necessary for the national and state governments to 
cooperate to bring about the results that are needed in agricultural and other 
industrial education. 
The consideration of the educational problem raises the greatest single ques- 
tion that has come before the commission, and which the commission has to 
place before the American people. Education has now come to have vastly 
more significance than the mere establishing and maintaining of schools. The 
education motive has been taken into all kinds of work with the people, directly 
in their homes and on their farms, and it reaches mature persons as well as 
youths. Beyond and behind all educational work there must be an aroused 
intelligent public sentiment; to make this sentiment is the most important work 
immediately before us. The whole country is alive with educational activity. 
While this activity may all be good, it nevertheless needs to be directed and 
correlated, and all the agencies should be more or less federated. 
The arousing of the people must be accomplished in terms of their daily lives 
or of their welfare. For the country people this means that it must be largely 
in terms of agriculture. Some of the colleges of agriculture are now doing this 
kind of work effectively, although on a pitiably small scale as compared with 
the needs. This is extension work, by which is meant all kinds of educational 
effort directly with the people, both old and young, at their homes and on their 
farms; it comprises all educational work that is conducted away from the  
-P-A-G-E-55

institution and for those who can not go to schools and colleges. The best exten- 
sion work now proceeding in this country—if measured by the effort to reach 
the people in their homes and on their own ground—is that coming from some 
of the colleges of agriculture and the United States Department of Agriculture. 
Within the last five or ten years the colleges of agriculture have been able to 
attack the problem of rural life in a new way. This extension work includes 
such efforts as local agricultural surveys, demonstrations on farms, nature 
study, and other work in schools, boys’ and girls’ clubs of many kinds, crop 
organizations, redirection of rural societies, reading clubs, library extension, 
lectures, traveling schools, farmers’ institutes, inspections of herds, barns, crops, 
orchards, and farms, publications of many kinds, and similar educational effort 
directly in the field. 
To accomplish these ends we suggest the establishment of a nation-wide 
extension work. ‘The first, or original, work of the agricultural branches of the 
land-grant colleges was academic in the old sense; later there was added the 
great field of experiment and research; there now should be added the third 
coordinate branch, comprising extension work, without which no college of 
agriculture can adequately serve its State. It is to the extension department 
of these colleges, if properly conducted, that we must now look for the most 
effective rousing of the people on the land. 
In order that all public educational work in the United States may be ade- 
quately studied and guided, we also recommend that the United States Bureau 
of Education be enlarged and supported in such a way that it will really repre- 
sent the educational activities of the nation, becoming a clearing house, and a 
collecting, distributing, and investigating organization. It is now wholly inade- 
quate to accomplish these ends. In a country in which education is said to 
be the national religion, this condition of our one expressly federal educational 
agency is pathetic. The good use already made of the small appropriations 
provided for the bureau shows clearly that it can render a most important 
service if sufficient funds are made available for its use. 
It is of the greatest consequence that the people of the open country should 
learn to work together, not only for the purpose of forwarding their economic 
interests and of competing with other men who are organized, but also to develop 
themselves and to establish an effective community spirit. This effort should 
be a genuinely cooperative or common effort in which all the associated persons 
have a voice in the management of the organization and share proportionately in 
its benefits. Many of the so-called “ cooperative” organizations are really not 
such, for they are likely to be controlled in the interest of a few persons rather 
than for all and with no thought of the good of the community at large. Some 
of the societies that are cooperative in name are really strong centralized cor- 
porations or stock companies that have no greater interest in the welfare of the 
patrons than other corporations have. 
At present the cooperative spirit works itself out chiefly in business organiza- 
tions devoted to selling and buying. So far as possible, these business organiza- 
tions should have more or less social uses. 
The commission consisted of Prof. L. H. Bailey, New York State 
College of Agriculture, Ithaca, N. Y., chairman; Mr. Henry Wallace, 
Wallace’s Farmer, Des Moines, Iowa; President Kenyon L. But- 
terfield, Massachusetts Agricultural College, Amherst, Mass.; Mr. 
Gifford Pinchot, United States Forest Service; Mr. Walter H. Page, 
editor of the World’s Work, New York City; Mr. Charles S. Barrett, 
Georgia; and Mr. William A. Beard, California.

SPECIAL EDUCATIONAL COMMISSION—CONNECTICUT. 
In 1907 the general assembly of Connecticut by an act continued 
the joint committee on education and directed them to investigate the 
public school system of the State and to make a report to the general 
assembly of 1909. Immediately after this action the joint committee 
met and designated five of their number to carry out the provisions 
of the continuing act. 
In their report, published by order of the general assembly in 1909, 
the special commissioners give the results of their investigations, 
which are summed up in twenty-two recommendations: 
1. That after a certain date the present “ district system” be abolished; that 
town school committees be elected; and that the towns be grouped so as to 
constitute territories for convenient supervision. 
2. That territorial supervisors be elected or appointed substantially in ac- 
cordance with the provisions of Chapter X of the Connecticut School Laws, 
their duties to be prescribed by the state board. 
3. That as a part of their duties the supervisors shall prescribe examinations 
suited to pupils in the eighth or higher grades, and issue to pupils satisfactorily 
passing these examinations diplomas certifying to their attainments. 
4, That after a certain date no teacher, not approved by the state board of 
education, shall be appointed to teach school in the State.

that children between 14 and 16 years of age are not exempt from school at- 
tendance under the law unless actually employed at labor.

free text-books are not supplied shall purchase text-books and other school 
supplies used in the public schools, and, subject to such regulations as to their 
care and custody as it may prescribe, loan them to the pupils of such schools 
free of charge, and, if instruction is given therein in the use of tools and 
cooking, may so purchase and loan the tools, implements, and materials neces- 
sary therefor: and no text-books not approved by the state board of edu- 
cation shall be used. 
14. That the state board of education be authorized to make provision for 
the teaching of agriculture in the normal schools in the State.

of the State, in the science and practice of common school teaching, under a 
course to be prescribed by the state board of education. 
17. That line 6 of section 76 of the Connecticut School Laws, relating to 
evening schools, be amended by striking out the word “ one,” so that instruction 
in any study usually taught in a high school may be given on petition of at 
least 20 persons over 14 years of age competent to pursue high-school studies.

cises as may be deemed by the board to be expedient, under such regulations 
and instructions as may best meet the varied requirements of the different 
grades in such schools. 
IOWA EDUCATIONAL COMMISSION. 
The educational commission of Iowa, the appointment of which 
was noted in Chapter I of the commissioner’s report for 1908, sub- 
mitted its report to the general assembly in January, 1909. A 
thorough codification of the school laws was made, and numerous 
important changes were suggested. Among the more important 
recommendations, as contained in the proposed new school code, were 
the following: 
1. That the county be made the unit of school control, and that a county 
board of education exercise supervision over the public schools. 
2, That provision be made for the consolidation, or dissolution, of small rural 
districts. 
3. That standards determining the character of district schools be fixed and 
maintained. 
4. That county superintendents be elected by county boards of education, that 
they need not be residents of the respective counties in which they are to serve, 
and that the salary paid in no case be less than $1,250. 
5. That the office of school treasurer be abolished, and that the county 
treasurer receive and disburse all school funds. . 
6. That the title “State Board of Educational Examiners” be changed to 
“State Board of Education,” and that its powers be enlarged and its facilities 
for supervision be increased. 
7. That the public schools of the State be thoroughly classified and the 
character of work prescribed, so that the terms “common school,” “graded 
school,” “ high school,” etc., may be well defined and understood. 
8. That the method of certification of teachers be changed, to the end that 
standards of qualifications of teachers may be raised. 
9. That legal sanction be given to the employment of teachers fora longer 
term than one year. 
10. That a state supervisor of public-school libraries be employed. 
11. That local school boards be permitted, if they see fit, to provide medical 
inspection for schools within their districts. 
Some general recommendations, not embodied in the proposed code, 
were made. Among these was the suggestion that a special commis-
-P-A-G-E-59
EDUCATIONAL BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. 47 
sion be appointed to supplement the work of the present commission. 
Questions suggested for the consideration of such a special commis- 
sion were: 
The establishment of a sufficient number of normal schools to provide ade- 
quate professional training for all the teachers in the rural and graded schools; 
the organization and determination of the scope of the higher educational insti- 
tutions; the provision of day schools for the deaf and blind in connection with 
existing public schools so as to afford opportunity for school education and also 
retain home advantages; the possible organization of the present schools for the 
deaf, blind, and incorrigibles as a part of the public-school system so as to secure 
more expert professional teaching in addition to the excellent business organiza- 
tion of the present; the possible incorporation of the state library commission 
under the state board of education; special state aid for high schools, graded 
and rural schools that maintain definite standards of work and efficiency. 
A constitutional amendment providing for the election of the 
state superintendent of public instruction by the state board of edu- 
cation was also suggested. 
BOARD FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF HIGHER STATE INSTITUTIONS, 
IOWA. 
By an act of the legislature of Iowa, approved March 29, 1909, the 
board of regents and the boards of trustees charged with the govern- 
ment of the state university, the college of agriculture and mechanic 
arts, and the normal school, were abolished on July 1, 1909, and the 
government of those institutions was committed to a board of educa- 
tion consisting of nine members appointed by the governor with the 
consent of the senate. Not more than five members of the board 
shall be of the same political party, and not more than three alumni 
of the above-mentioned institutions and but one alumnus from each 
institution may be members of the board at any one time. Appoint- 
ments subsequent to the first appointments shall be for a period of 
six years, and three members shall be appointed every second year. 
The board shall meet four times a year, and special meetings may be 
called. Each member of the board is allowed $7 for each day he is 
actually engaged in the performance of his official duties, not exceed- 
ing sixty days in any one year, and mileage at the rate of 2 cents per 
mile of necessary travel. The board has power to elect and fix sala- 
ries of officers, teachers, and employees of the three institutions men- 
tioned; to make rules and regulations for the management of the 
institutions, to manage and control their property; to direct the ex- 
penditure of funds; and to do other acts necessary for the execution 
of the powers and duties conferred on them by law. 
The board shall appoint a finance committee of three from outside 
its membership who shall devote all their time to the work of the 
institutions and shall each receive a salary of $3,500 per year and  
-P-A-G-E-60
  
48 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
necessary traveling expenses incurred in visiting the several institu- 
tions. The members of the finance committee shall, once each month, 
attend each of the institutions for the purpose of familiarizing them- 
selves with the work being done and transacting any business that 
may properly be brought before them as a committee. The office of 
the board and of the finance committee is at Des Moines, Iowa. 
KANSAS EDUCATIONAL COMMISSION. 
According to Bulletin No. 1 of the Kansas educational commission, 
published in December, 1908, the following recommendations were 
made to the session of the legislature to meet in January, 1909: 
1. That the legislature adopt a resolution providing for the appointment of an 
educational commission to codify the school laws and to recommend such further 
legislation as may seem best for the interests of the public-school system. 
2. That a longer term for rural schools be established. It is suggested that 
seven months be fixed as the minimum length of school term, and that state aid 
be given the weaker districts. 
8. That the existing law providing for the consolidation of weaker and smaller 
districts be simplified and made more efficient. <= 
4, That when two or more districts consolidate under prescribed conditions 
the consolidated district be given state aid to the amount of $75. 
5. That two state inspectors of schools be provided for; one for the common 
schools and one for the village and city schools. 
6. That a more uniform and efficient method of certification of teachers be 
adopted and that qualifications be fixed. Two classes of certificates are named— 
“country certificates,” to be of three grades, and “secondary (high school) cer- 
tificates,” to be of two grades. 
7. That the unit of school organization be made larger. It is suggested that 
the township displace the district as the unit of control. 
8. That provision be made for the employment of teachers for longer periods 
than one year. 
9. That the date of holding annual school meetings be changed, and that such 
meetings be held in the month of March. 
10. That local taxes derived from railroads be more equitably distributed, so 
that districts not lying on or contiguous to railroads may receive their share, 
11. That the constitutional provision relative to escheats be made more effec- 
tual, by legislative enactment, so that the permanent school fund may secure all 
property belonging to it under such constitutional provision. 
12. That objectionable features of the Barnes law relative to county high 
schools be removed, so that counties that have refused to take advantage of it 
may do so. 
18. That the compulsory education law be so amended as to apply to all chil- 
dren between the eighth and sixteenth birthdays. Certain exceptions are 
suggested. 
14. That normal courses be established in other high schools besides the 21 
county high schools now having such courses. 
15. That the elements of agriculture be required to be taught in all county 
high schools. 
16. That such legislation be enacted as shall insure thorough inspection of all 
school buildings with relation to their sanitary conditions,
-P-A-G-E-61
  
EDUCATIONAL BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. 49 
17. That legislation for the proper safeguarding of school buildings against 
fire be enacted. 
18. That in all cities of the first, second, and third class school boards shall be 
authorized and directed to prescribe definite fire drills. 
19. That the time, place, and manner of holding “county diploma examina- 
tions” be made uniform throughout the State, and that the same qualifications 
be required of all graduates. 
20. That a law be passed that will relieve certain county superintendents for 
a portion of the year of the purely mechanical work of the office, and that shall 
compel a larger amount of time to be devoted to the actual supervision of schools. 
To this end clerical help is suggested. 
21. That a library of not less than 50 volumes be established in every school 
district, and that a state school library board be constituted to prepare lists of 
suitable books and otherwise aid in their selection. 
22, That provision be made for the election of county superintendents in such 
a manner as to remove the office from politics. 
23. That appropriation be made to defray the expenses of superintendents 
attending the county superintendents’ annual meeting. 
24. That a uniform law relating to the size and organization of school boards 
be enacted. It is suggested that boards of education in cities of the first and 
second class consist of six members. 
25. That the uniform text-book law be so amended as to raise the price of 
certain books and reduce the price of others. 
26. That various minor changes in the school laws be made. 
MICHIGAN COMMISSION ON INDUSTRIAL AND AGRICULTURAL 
EDUCATION. 
A Michigan law, approved June-2, 1909, authorized the governor to 
appoint a commission of not less than five nor more than seven mem- 
bers, serving without pay, whose duty it shall be— 
to make a careful study of the conditions of elementary, industrial, and agri- 
cultural education in the State of Michigan, whether under public school or 
other auspices, including the study of conditions of labor as they affect children 
between the ages of 14 and 18, and it shall further be the duty of this com- 
mission to present a report showing these conditions, with recommendations 
for such a plan of elementary, industrial, and agricultural ‘training in con- 
nection with the public schools of the State as shall, in their judgment, best 
meet the conditions shown to exist. 
NEBRASKA EDUCATIONAL COMMISSION. 
The Nebraska educational commission, which was charged with 
preparing a new course of study for common schools, completed this 
work in season for its publication in June, 1909. According to a 
statement in the Nebraska Teacher for that month, in the new— 
course are incorporated the best features of the Illinois and South Dakota 
courses, with such modifications as seemed necessary, and with the introduc- 
tion of material especially adaptable to Nebraska conditions. The course of 
study will contain supplementary matter with reference to pupils’ reading- 
circle work, boys’ and girls’ associations, school libraries, and important sug- 
9228—rp 1909—voL 1——4

gestions with reference to carrying out the free high-school law. The Nebraska 
standard courses of study for one, two, three, and four year high schools are 
also included. 
NORTH DAKOTA SCHOOL LAW COMPILATION COMMISSION. 
An act of the North Dakota legislature, approved March 11, 1909, 
provides for a commission of five persons, to be created not later than 
August 1, 1909— 
of whom the attorney-general and the deputy state superintendent of public 
instruction shall be members, and the other three members shall be appointed 
by the governor from among the best known and the best posted school men 
of this State. 
The commission is directed to “report to the next session of the 
legislature any contradiction, inconsistencies, and omissions found 
in the existing laws,” and to— 
draft and report to that session of the legislature such school laws as, in its 
judgment, would be of use and benefit to the State, for information, assistance, 
and action of said legislature. 
BOARD OF HIGHER CURRICULA—OREGON. 
At the special session of the legislature of Oregon in 1909 a law 
was enacted providing for the establishment of “the board of higher 
curricula,” to consist of five members to be appointed by the governor 
with the consent of the senate. With the exception of the members 
first appointed the term of office shall be for a period of five years, 
one member to be appointed each year. No member of the board, 
alumni, or faculty of any of the higher educational institutions shall 
be appointed to the board. Meetings shall be held annually and 
special meetings shall be called on petition of any three members. 
It is the duty of the board to determine what courses of studies or 
departments, if any, shall not be duplicated in the University of 
Oregon and the State Agricultural College, and to determine and 
define the courses of study and departments to be offered and con- 
ducted by each of these institutions. 
PENNSYLVANIA EDUCATIONAL COMMISSION. 
The Pennsylvania educational commission, authorized by the legis- 
lature of Pennsylvania in 1907, presented to the legislature of 1909 
in the form of a bill an entire and complete school code for the public- 
school system of Pennsylvania. The bill was amended in so many 
important particulars by the legislature before it was passed that it 
was unsatisfactory to many people of the State and was finally vetoed 
by the governor. The proposed code contained provisions for the 
appointment of a state board of education; the establishment of two 
colleges of education in connection with the University of Pennsyl-
-P-A-G-E-63

vania and the University of Pittsburg; the appointment of assistant 
county superintendents of schools; medical inspection ; vocational and 
other special schools. 
EDUCATIONAL COMMISSION CONSTITUTED BY THE TEXAS CONFER- 
ENCE FOR EDUCATION. 
The first meeting of the educational commission constituted by 
the Texas conference for education (see p. 62) was held in Austin, 
Saturday, May 1, 1909. The commission was organized for the work 
of study by division into three committees, as follows: 
Committee on maintenance: R. B. Cousins, of Austin; R. B. Bin- 
nion, of Paris; and W. D. Cleveland, of Houston. 
Committee on organization and correlation: W. S. Sutton, of Aus- 
tin; C. P. Fountain, of College Station; and Theodore Harris, of San 
Antonio. : 
Committee on teachers and instruction: P. W. Horn, of Houston; 
W. H. Bruce, of Denton; and Mrs. Maggie Barry, of Sherman. 
The first committee will consider the whole subject of taxation and 
support of the common schools. The second committee will study 
the whole subject of school administration, from the rural schools to 
the university, and the harmonizing of the entire system by means of 
such boards and agencies as may be devised. The third committee 
will study the whole course of qualifications of teachers and course of 
study and of the internal affairs of the schoolroom, 
The commission enters upon the task with no fixed notion, and 
is seeking information and advice from the whole body of Texas 
teachers and others who may be interested in educational better- 
ment, to the end that Texas may have the very best educational sys- 
tem that may possibly be constructed. (Texas School Magazine, 
May, 1909.) 
UTAH SCHOOLHOUSE COMMISSION. 
An act of the legislature of Utah approved March 9, 1909, pro- 
vides for a schoolhouse commission to consist of the state superin- 
tendent of public instruction, the secretary of the state board of 
health, and an architect to be appointed by the governor, to whom 
must be submitted for approval the plans and specifications of any 
schoolhouse, or addition thereto, costing more than $1,000, to be 
erected in any school district in the State outside of cities of the first 
and second class. The act requires a minimum amount of 15 square 
feet of floor space and 200 cubic feet of air space for each pupil, pro- 
vision for proper ventilation and egress in case of fire, and forbids 
the erection of any schoolhouse with the furnace or heating apparatus 
in the basement or immediately under such building.

VERMONT STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION. 
By an act approved December 14, 1908, the legislature of Vermont 
created a state board of education consisting of the governor as 
chairman, the state superintendent of education, and three members 
appointed by the governor. After the first appointments the ap- 
pointed members are to serve for three years, one member to be ap-

term of two years one resident commissioner in each town where a 
normal school is located who shall act with the state board of educa- 
tion in matters pertaining to the normal school in the town of his 
residence. The board is to assume all the powers and duties of the 
board of normal school commissioners, and will have full control 
and management of the normal schools and any normal-industrial 
or industrial school that may be established by the State. 
VERMONT EDUCATIONAL COMMISSION. 
By an act approved January 28, 1909, the legislature of Vermont 
provided for the appointment by the governor of a commission con- 
sisting of five members— 
to investigate and consider ways and means of improving the public schools by 
increasing facilities for training teachers, by making the work in such schools 
more practical through instruction in agriculture and manual arts, and by 
adjusting the present system of public education to ends more promotive of the 
public interests of the State. 
The commission is to render a report to the general assembly of

[From a report made to Science by C. R. Mann, secretary of section L.] 
The Baltimore meeting of Section L showed that this new section 
is growing in strength and usefulness. The section’s policy of devot- 
ing each session to a single topic with set papers by invited speakers 
was tried and proved a great success. The section plans to devote

AMERICAN FEDERATION OF ARTS. 
The American Federation of Arts was organized at a convention 
held in Washington, D. C., May 11-18, 1909, of persons interested in 
the improvement of art conditions. The objects of the federation, as 
stated in the constitution, are “to unite in fellowship all institutions 
and organizations interested in architecture, sculpture, painting, 
landscape, craftsmanship, collections of art, and village and city 
development; to harmonize and nationalize the art interests of the 
country ; to stimulate the love of beauty and to cultivate public taste.” 
The active membership is limited to institutions and organizations, 
each of which shall constitute a chapter. 
Among the officers elected at the organization meeting are Mr. 
Charles L. Hutchinson, Chicago, Ill., president; Miss Leila Mechlin, 
Washington, D. C., assistant secretary. ‘The headquarters of the 
federation are located at 1741 New York avenue, Washington, D. C. 
The more specific purposes of the association, as outlined by Sena- 
tor Root in an address delivered at the meeting, include the fol- 
lowing: 
1. To encourage the organization of art societies; the establishment of art 
schools and art galleries; to encourage the exhibition of private art collections 
for the benefit of the public; to encourage American artists and to aid in secur- 
ing higher recognition for merit. 
2. To encourage the study of art in the public schools, particularly in the 
towns and villages; to encourage boards of education, school superintendents, 
and the faculties of seminaries, academies, colleges, and universities to pay 
more attention to the cultivation of the taste of their students and to teach 
them correct ideas in art and the advantage of making things beautiful. 
3. To encourage the appointment of competent commissions in municipalities 
and States to supervise public architecture, monuments, parks, plans, and other 
improvements in order that they may be in accordance with the best rules of 
art. 
4. To improve the standard of private architecture; to encourage the plant- 
ing of trees, shrubbery, hedges in the farms and dooryards, and whatever may 
be done to embellish the public streets of cities, towns, and villages. 
5. To support the plan of the park commission for beautifying the city of 
Washington, and to aid in persuading Congress to follow its suggestions in the 
location of future public buildings, monuments, and other improvements at 
the national capital.

6. To assist in preserving natural scenery from destruction and desecration ; 
to extend the national-park system, the forest reserves, and preservation of 
historic and natural landmarks. 
7. To promote the movement for public playgrounds, school gardens, and 
other efforts to cultivate the love of nature and of art in the minds of children, 
8. To support the movement for the enlargement of the jurisdiction of the 
Supervising Architect of the Treasury and the organization of a bureau of 
arts which shall have supervision of all public buildings, monuments, and other 
improvements ordered by Congress throughout the United States, and the 
appointment, pursuant to legislation, of an advisory council of experts*to ad- 
vance the standard of public architecture. 
9. To support and advance the National Gallery of Art, which has already 
been established under the Smithsonian Institution by gifts and bequests of im- 
portant collections from the late Harriet Lane Johnston, of Washington; Mr. 
William T. Evans, of New York, and Mr. Charles L. Freer, of Detroit. 
10. To assist in securing the erection of an appropriate building for the Na- 
tional Gallery at Washington corresponding to the Congressional Library and 
the National Museum. 
11. To afford an organization through which the general opinion of all Ameri- 
cans who are lovers of beauty in art and in nature may find expression and be 
made effective as from time to time public questions shall arise which ought to 
be determined by the highest standards of taste. 
In the course of an address at the organization meeting, Elmer 
Ellsworth Brown, United States Commissioner of Education, made 
the following remarks upon the function of art in the schools: 
The most obvious thing to the great majority of our people is the fact that 
scientific education has to do with the increase of human convenience and 
human comfort. For that very reason this thing that is so absolutely essential 
and is, in some respects, the highest and the finest thing in our modern educa- 
tion, may frankly be admitted to be a thing that is attended with danger. It is 
attended with a danger of the subtlest materialism. There can be no doubt that 
this science must be supplemented by something else, if it is to escape that 
subtle danger of materialism, a danger that is perhaps more serious in the case 
of those whom it affects least grossly—in the case of those whom it affects upon 
the most spiritual side. 
Our science, as we teach it in the schools, lays stress such as no earlier edu- 
cation could lay upon the ability of the present age and the ability of the single 
individual to put things to the test. Our knowledge is to be verified now and 
here, not by a slow process, but by an immediate process. It is to be verified on 
the spot. We come, accordingly, to have only incidental care for the slow mak- 
ing of human thought and human character, through the ages, because we have 
so much greater interest in the discovery of natural laws which can be worked 
out right here in this laboratory by this single man. We need, for the sake of 
our common humanity, to have a new emphasis upon those things that can not 
be done on the spot. 
We need a new insistence upon those things which can be tested and verified 
and determined only in the long course of human experience, of racial experi- 
ence, otherwise we tend to isolate ourselves and become simply crumbling units, 
having only a loose connection one with another in an intense individualism. We 
need to acquire a new respect for those values that only time can reveal, and 
that is what art has to give to us. It is to give to us a new appreciation of 
things that are old, of things that are capable of standing the test of time. It 
is to correct that modern danger of valuing things in proportion as they are new.

AMERICAN FEDERATION OF TEACHERS OF THE MATHEMATICAL 
AND THE NATURAL SCIENCES. 
A meeting of delegates of associations interested in the formation of 
the American Federation of Teachers of the Mathematical and the 
Natural Sciences was held in Chicago, January 1, 1908. There were 
present representatives of the following associations: Association of 
Physics Teachers of Washington City; Association of Mathematics 
Teachers of New England; Central Association of Science and Mathe- 
matics Teachers; Colorado Mathematical Society; Connecticut Asso- 
ciation of Science Teachers; Indiana State Science Teachers’ Associa- 
tion; Kansas State Association, mathematics -section; Michigan 
Schoolmasters’ Club, mathematics, physics, and biology sections; Ne- 
braska State Association, physical science section; New England 
Association of Chemistry Teachers; New York State Science Teach- 
ers’ Association; North Dakota Association of Science Teachers; 
Northeastern Ohio Association of Science and Mathematics Teachers. 
Articles of federation were adopted which provide that only associa- 
tions whose purpose is the study of the problems of science and mathe- 
matics teaching and whose active members number 25 or more are 
eligible to membership; that an association joins the federation by 
appointing delegates to a body known as the “ Council of the Ameri- 
can. Federation; ” that the duties of the council shall consist in devis- 
ing methods by which the associations may work together for the bet- 
terment of the teaching of science and of mathematics. 
The council of the federation met in Baltimore, Md., December 28, 
1908. The report of the executive committee outlined the work of 
the year, including the appointment of a special committee on the 
bibliography of science teaching. Three committees were authorized, 
as follows: One on a syllabus of propositions in geometry; one on 
publication and publicity, to report in 1909 on the present needs and 
facilities for publishing material of interest to the federation, and to 
make recommendations as to ways and means of improving these 
facilities; and one to investigate the present conditions of college 
entrance, to define the attitude of the federation toward college- 
entrance problems, and to recommend action that may tend to unify 
and simplify college-entrance requirements. 
The officers for 1909 are as follows: Dr. H. W. Tyler, president; 
Dr. C. R. Mann, University of Chicago, secretary-treasurer.

(The Independent, Sept. 9, 1909.) 
ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES AND PREPARATORY SCHOOLS OF THE 
MIDDLE STATES AND MARYLAND. 
The twenty-second annual convention of the Association of Col- 
leges and Preparatory Schools of the Middle States and Maryland 
was held at Franklin and Marshall College, Lancaster, Pa., on 
November 27 and 28, 1908. One hundred and eighty-one delegates 
were registered, representing 94 institutions of learning. 
The committee on the establishment of a college entrance certifi- 
cate board reported that a number of meetings had been held during 
the year, and that a constitution and rules had been adopted by the 
committee. The committee reported also that the revised constitu- 
tion had been referred back to the colleges, and that as soon as it 
had received the approval of not less than 15 colleges the board 
would be organized. The report was unanimously adopted by the 
association. The principal officers for 1908-9 are: James D. Moffat, 
Washington and Jefferson College, Washington, Pa., president, and 
Prof. Arthur H. Quinn, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, 
Pa., secretary. 
The next convention will be held in Washington, November 26 and 
27, 1909. 
ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES AND PREPARATORY SCHOOLS OF THE 
SOUTHERN STATES. 
The fourteenth annual meeting of the Association of Colleges and 
Preparatory Schools of the Southern States was held at Chattanooga, 
Tenn., November 5-6, 1908. The object of this association, as stated
-P-A-G-E-70
  58 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
in its constitution, “shall be to consider the qualifications of candi- 
dates for admission to colleges, the methods of admission, the charac- 
ter of the preparatory schools, the courses of studies to be pursued 
in the colleges and schools, including their order, number, etc., as 
well as such other subjects as tend to the promotion of interests com- 
mon to colleges and preparatory schools.” 
The fourteenth meeting was occupied almost exclusively with 
the consideration of the adoption of new by-laws, in which a higher 
standard is exacted of candidates for admission to college. The by- 
laws finally adopted, to become operative in September, 1910, are 
as follows: 
1. No college belonging to this association shall maintain a preparatory 
school as part of its college organization. In case such school is maintained 
under the college charter, it must be kept rigidly distinct in students, faculty, 
and discipline. 
2. Every. college belonging to the association shall seek to promote the 
development of high schools in every way, and to this end shall admit no stu- 
dents except those who have completed a reputable high school course. In 
measuring the amount of work done by such students, the association accepts 
the valuation indicated in the first annual report of the Carnegie Foundation 
for the Advancement of Teaching, published in 1906. 
8. Candidates seeking full admission to college for any degree course in the 
literary department must offer 14 units of work. Irregular students may be 
admitted to partial standing by offering 10 units of work. Students may be 
admitted either on certificate or on written examination, but they must in all 
cases comply with the above requirements as to the amount of work offered. 
Conditions may not be so construed as to excuse students from offering at 
least 10 units of preparatory work. The association strongly recommends 
that all candidates be required to offer English and mathematics, and that 
all candidates for full admission or for any degree courses be required to 
offer the necessary preparation in two languages besides English. Irregular 
students may become regular, that is, may secure full admission to college 
by passing off the necessary number of units in subjects prescribed for admis- 
sion as the result of private study or in class; but college work thus offered 
for admission must not be counted toward a degree. 
4. Special students may be admitted to college without the usual form of 
examination under the following conditions: (a) They must be of mature 
age (not less than 20 years is suggested); (b) they must not be admitted to 
classes for which entrance examinations are required unless they pass such 
examinations; (c) they must give proof of adequate preparation for the course 
sought; (d) their names must be separately printed in the catalogue. 
5. No preparatory school that confers degrees shall be eligible to membership 
in the association. Any school seeking membership must have a curriculum of 
study amply sufficient to meet the fullest requirements of the association for 
admission to college and must have students regularly finishing such course of 
study each year. 
President F. P. Venable of the University of North Carolina was 
elected president of the association for 1908-9, and Dr. Frederick W. 
Moore, of Vanderbilt University, secretary.

Through the kindness and courtesy of Dr. Robert C. Ogden and 
the Southern Education Board the members of the Association of 
Southern State Superintendents of Public Instruction were afforded

the opportunity of visiting and inspecting the schools of New York 
City and Boston and of examining the work of the state department 
of education at Albany, N. Y., in October, 1908. 
The following superintendents met at the Seymour Hotel, in New 
York City, on the morning of October 12, 1908; J. N. Powers, Mis- 
sissippi; R. B. Cousins, Texas; H. C. Gunnels, Alabama; R. L. Jones, 
Tennessee; T. C. Miller, West Virginia; J. G. Crabbe, Kentucky; 
T. C. Harris, Louisiana; G. B. Cook, Arkansas; J. M. Pound, 
Georgia; O. B. Martin, South Carolina; W. M. Holloway, Florida; 
J. Y. Joyner, North Carolina. 
By special invitation, Hon. J. B. Aswell, retiring state superin- 
tendent of Louisiana; Dr. Wickliffe Rose, general agent of the Pea- 
body fund; Dr. P. P. Claxton, chairman of the campaign committee 
of the Southern Education Board, were present and accompanied 
the Southern State Superintendents on their itinerary. Dr. Robert 
C. Ogden also accompanied the party throughout the itinerary. 
October 12 and 18 were spent in visiting Teachers College of Co- 
lumbia University, the City College of New York, and the public 
schools of Greater New York, including the normal schools of the 
city. October 15 and 16 were devoted to a visit to Harvard Univer- 
sity and the Boston public schools. October 17 was spent in exam- 
ining the work of the New York State department of education at 
Albany. 
The party was cordially welcomed everywhere and given every 
opportunity to observe and study the work in the schools visited. 
The superintendents made a special study of teacher training and 
industrial work. 
At the close of the itinerary it was the unanimous verdict of the 
Southern State Superintendents that they had derived inspiration 
and information for the educational work of their respective States 
from this study at first hand and this observation in the concrete of 
the best work of some of the best schools of New York and Massa- 
chusetts. 
            
                             CALIFORNIA TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
The California Teachers’ Association, at its meeting at San Jose, 
December, 1908, provided for a permanent secretary at a salary of 
$2,400, who will devote his whole attention to the duties of the office 
and will act as editor of an organ to be published monthly. 
            
  CATHOLIC EDUCATIONAL CONVENTION.    
       At the annual convention of the Catholic Educational Association, 
held in Cincinnati in July, 1908, Right Rev. D. J. O’Connell, of the 
Catholic University, being president-general, more than two score 
     
-P-A-G-E-74
  62 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
States were represented by the 500 delegates to the different depart- 
ments of the association, including a large attendance of nuns repre- 
senting the teaching orders in all parts of the United States. 
Archbishop Moeller, who officiated, in his opening address spoke 
of the growing conviction among thoughtful educators outside the 
church of the necessity of combining religious with secular knowl- 
edge in the schools. 
A report on “The present condition of education in the United 
States,” by Very Rev. E. A. Pace, of the Catholic University, empha- 
sized the necessity of greater unification, systematization, and cor- 
relation in Catholic schools. He noted the fact that a closer union 
between the parochial school, the college, and the university is 
gradually being effected, whereby it will become possible to give a 
child a thorough Catholic education from his first school days to his 
graduation from the university. 
Rev. Dr. T. E. Shields, also of the Catholic University, advocated 
a system of teaching religion in the schools similar to that employed 
with secular branches, that is, by comparison and object lessons, 
which would be more effective than the usual method whereby a child 
is compelled to commit to memory a cut-and-dried course without 
grasping its meaning. Other speakers objected to this method as too 
revolutionary, insufficient, vague, and unpractical. 
A paper by Dr. John E. Griewe, of Cincinnati, advocated the in- 
struction of parochial-school teachers in the nature of infectious and 
contagious diseases and a system of medical inspection of the schools. 
Apparatus for physical training is entirely unnecessary, he asserted, 
walking, running, and jumping in the open air being the best exercises. 
A proposition to require uniform text-books for the schools of a 
diocese received approval at a teachers’ meeting. In the school de- 
partment the subject of children’s reading was discussed, and a mo- 
tion carried to appoint a library committee to work in cooperation 
with the Catholic Truth Society in preparing a list of children’s 
books. At the superintendents’ conference the examination of teach- 
ers and teachers’ meetings furnished topics for discussion. 
Practically all the officers of the preceding year were reelected, and 
Boston was selected for the 1909 meeting. 
CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION IN TEXAS. 
The Conference for Education in Texas was organized February 
22, 1907, to supply a popular need for a nonpartisan association com- 
posed of business and professional men to promote the interests of 
education in the State. More than 500 citizens responded to the call 
for the organization meeting. Since its formation the conference has 
been unceasing in its efforts to create a public opinion favorable to 
 
-P-A-G-E-75
EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS, CONFERENCES, ETC. 63 
good schools and improved school equipment. Up to April, 1909, it 
had issued ten bulletins, of which it had distributed more than 250,000 
copies, and it has sent speakers to all sections of Texas. The confer- 
ence has been mainly instrumental in securing the passage of impor- 
tant laws that increased the appropriation per capita for the support 
of the public free schools, lengthened the school term from five months 
to more than six months, established professional county supervision 
in more than sixty counties, and otherwise contributed to the improve- 
ment of the whole system in the State. 
It was through the efforts of the state-wide campaign conducted by 
the conference that the adoption of a constitutional amendment was 
brought about in 1908, which substitutes majority rule for the two- 
thirds rule in the school-tax elections and authorizes districts to levy 
certain local taxes. Of nine amendments submitted to the people of 
the State at the November election this was the only one adopted. 
At the meeting of the conference held at Austin in March, 1909, 
a resolution was adopted directing the president to appoint, with the 
advice of the executive board, a commission to formulate a plan for 
the reorganization of the educational system of Texas, and report 
the same at the next annual meeting. An account of the action taken 
at the first meeting of this commission is given on page 51. 
Officers: Clarence Ousley, Fort Worth, president and chairman of 
the executive board; J. L. Kesler, Waco, vice-president; A. N. Mc- 
Callum, Austin, recording secretary; W. S. Sutton, Austin, corre- 
sponding secretary; C. E. Evans, Austin, general agent. 
CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH. 
The Twelfth Annual Conference for Education in the South was 
held in Atlanta, Ga., April 14-16, 1909. Its recommendations are 
embodied in the following resolutions adopted by the conference: 
First. Improvement in county supervision as the strategic point in the entire 
educational system. 
Second. The professional training of teachers to meet the just demand for 
more efficient service, and especially the strengthening of the Department of 
Hducation in the higher institutions for the training of men as teachers and 
principals of high schools and as superintendents. 
Third. The extension of local school improvement leagues to every community 
in the South and the earnest effort to place this inspiring work upon a self- 
supporting basis. 
Fourth. Continued efforts in behalf of compulsory education in such a manner 
as may be deemed wise in each State. 
Fifth. We recognize with delight the increase in dignity and power of the 
office of state superintendent of education, which is attracting the strongest 
men among us, and the growing recognition of these leaders as the real shep- 
herds of the people. 
Sixth. The National Bureau of Education at Washington has made such use 
of its limited resources as has rendered it a valued reenforcement of every good

educational movement throughout the land. We are glad to note that Congress 
has begun to make a distinct increase in the appropriations for this office. Such 
increase as has hitherto been made is, however, wholly inadequate to the needs 
of the office and painfully disproportionate to the importance of the interests 
which it serves. We respectfully urge upon Congress that it undertake without 
further delay the placing of this bureau upon such a plane of efficiency as will 
enable it to render in full the service which the States represented in this con- 
ference require and expect from such a Federal office. 
CONFERENCE FOR THE ORGANIZATION OF A CHILD-WELFARE 
BUREAU. 
A conference was held at Worcester, Mass., July 6 to 10, 1909, the 
ultimate object of which was an organization of all the societies and 
movements having to do with child life. To President G. Stanley 
Hall, of Clark University, is due the initiative in the new movement. 
A number of prominent educators attended the meeting, including 
not only those directly associated with colleges and universities, but 
also many leaders in the playground, kindergarten, medical care, 
child labor, and kindred organizations. A committee was appointed 
to prepare a plan of organization of a child-study bureau. 
The new organization will be known as the “ Child Conference for 
Research and Welfare.” Mr. Henry S. Curtis has been elected general 
secretary. The following societies, movements, and agencies are em- 
braced in the organization: Mothers’ congress, day nursery, the kin- 
dergarten, child institutional homes, scientific child study, special 
education of defective and subnormal children, juvenile psychological 
clinic, tuberculosis agencies for children, eugenic movements, health 
associations, courts of child labor, playground movement, children’s 
libraries, drama, music and dancing for children, recreative nature 
study, American Home Economic Association, the General Federation 
of Women’s Clubs, the Association of Collegiate Alumne, and others. 
The child study bureau, which will be established this fall at Clark 
University, will be entirely independent of the new organization, but 
will be represented in it to the extent that all the other societies are. 
CONFERENCE OF CAMPAIGN MANAGERS FOR THE SOUTHERN 
STATES. 
There was a special conference of the campaign managers for the 
Southern States, held at Atlanta, April 15, 1909, in connection with 
the Twelfth Conference for Education in the South, P. P. Claxton 
presiding. The following campaign managers for the several States 
were present: J. Y. Joyner, North Carolina; Henry E. Fries, North 
Carolina; O. B. Martin, South Carolina; W. H. Hand, South Caro- 
lina; Jere M. Pound, Georgia; Mrs. Walter B. Hill, Georgia; H. C.

ensuing year. 
CONFERENCE OF CHIEF STATE SCHOOL OFFICERS. 
[Report of the secretary.] 
The Third Conference of Chief State School Officers was held at 
Denver, Colo., July 8, 1909, and was called to order by Elmer Ells- 
worth Brown, United States Commissioner of Education, who spoke 
briefly of the good resulting from the two conferences previously 
held in Washington, D. C., and in Chicago. 
On motion, the conference selected State Superintendent Nathan 
C. Schaeffer, of Pennsylvania, as chairman, and State Superintendent 
John F. Riggs, of Iowa, as secretary. 
State Superintendent J. Y. Joyner, of North Carolina, State 
Superintendent Edward Hyatt, of California, County Superintend- 
ent Kate Logan, of Cherokee County, Iowa, and President John W. 
Cook, of the State Normal School, De Kalb, IIl., spoke to the topic 
“Supervision and rural school improvement; district superintend- 
ent; county superintendent; township superintendent, etc.” 
State Superintendent Katherine M. Cook, of Colorado, State 
Superintendent S. Belle Chamberlain, of Idaho, and State Superin- 
tendent E. D. Cameron, of Oklahoma, spoke to the topic “ Revenues 
and school improvement.” 
State Superintendent Howard A. Gass, of Missouri, and State 
Superintendent R. B. Cousins, of Texas, spoke to the topic “The 
country school and farm life.” 
The talks were all informal, and in the main recited the experiences 
of the several speakers in dealing, in their respective States, with 
the paramount problem of rural school improvement. 
On motion of State Superintendent Robert J. Aley, of Indiana, 
the Commissioner of Education was requested to call a fourth con- 
ference of the chief school officers of the United States, to be held 
at Indianapolis in connection with the National Convention of the 
Department of Superintendence in March, 1910. 
The following States were represented in this, the third conference, 
by the persons named: : 
California, State Superintendent Edward Hyatt. 
Colorado, State Superintendent Katherine M. Cook. 
Idaho, State Superintendent S. Belle Chamberlain. 
Illinois, State Superintendent F. G. Blair.

CONFERENCE OF OFFICERS OF STATE ASSOCIATIONS. 
[Communicated to the Bureau by Mr. W. W. Remington, secretary to the conference.] 
At the conference of officers of state associations held in Denver, 
Colo., July 9, 1909, the following-named persons were constituted a 
committee on permanent organization: 
Supt. Ebenezer Mackey, Trenton, N. J., chairman of the committee. 
Supt. B. G. Shackelford, Cape Girardeau, Mo. 
Secretary L. E. Armstrong, San Francisco, Cal. 
Supt. N. R. Baker, Ensley, Ala. 
Secretary W. W. Remington, Denver, Colo., secretary to the com- 
mittee. 
Corresponding Secretary J. Fred Olander, Pierre, S. Dak. 
Supt. Charles S. Foos, Reading, Pa., was made permanent chair- 
man of the conference for the term of one year, and W. W. Remington 
was made permanent secretary for the same term. Superintendent 
Foos is expected to act with the committee on permanent organization. 
The committee is instructed to present a petition to the directors of 
the National Education Association for the formation of a depart- 
ment to be known as the “Conference of Officers of State Associa-
-P-A-G-E-79
  
EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS, CONFERENCES, ETC. 67 
tions.” The statement of the purposes of the conference as con- 
tained in the petition is as follows: 
It is expected that the conference of officers of state associations will collect 
and disseminate information regarding the organization and the activities of 
state teachers’ associations; that it will serve as a means of securing coopera- 
tion among such associations in engaging speakers and preparing annual pro- 
grammes; that it will consider educational topics upon which concert of action 
by teachers’ organizations may be desirable, and make recommendations concern- 
ing such concert of action, and that it may, in all ways practicable, serve as a 
means of advancing the efficiency of teachers’ organizations in constructive work 
of every sort for the advancement of education and of the teacher. 
The petition is to be circulated by mail for signatures and presented 
to the directors at their next meeting. In case the petition shall be 
refused, the committee is to prepare a programme as a “ Society 
meeting with the National Education Association ” for publication 
in the official programme for the meeting of 1910. 
Chapter III of this report. contains a paper on state educational 
associations by Mr. Charles S. Foos, superintendent of the public 
schools of Reading, Pa. 
CONFERENCE OF PROFESSORS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION IN 
THE SOUTH. 
On April 12-14, 1909, there were held in connection with the con- 
ference for education in the South a number of conferences of pro- 
fessors of secondary education in the South. The general conclu- 
sions of the conference are expressed in the following resolutions, 
adopted at the final meeting on Wednesday: 
1. It is most necessary to impress upon the public the fact that the elementary 
school, the high school, the college, and the university, whether supported by 
taxation or in other ways, are parts of one system of public instruction, not 
unrelated and independent schools. A State can secure educational efficiency 
only when these different parts of its educational system articulate and co- 
operate. 
2. To secure such cooperation and coordination some effective form of organi- 
zation and supervision must be adopted by each State. 
8. This form of organization would include expert superintendence over public 
instruction, both in State and county. 
4. Such officers should be chosen from the best educational experts, and their 
places should be made equal in dignity, responsibility, remuneration, and free- 
dom from political interference to those of the best paid officers in colleges and 
universities. 
5. Such supervisors of education should work in effective cooperation with the 
institutions of higher learning. AIl colleges and universities, whether upon pub- 
lie or private foundation, are public institutions, and owe it to themselves and 
to the cause of education to take an intelligent and sympathetic interest in the 
upbuilding of secondary and elementary schools; not simply as feeders to them- 
selves, but as factors in the economic and social advancement of the State.
-P-A-G-E-80
    68 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
6. In virtue of their duties as public institutions, all colleges, whether con- 
nected with the State or with a denomination ought to give free access to 
their records and full information to the public concerning all details of their 
academic and financial administration. The honest college has everything to 
gain and nothing to lose by taking the public into its confidence. 
7. While the elevation of standards in the colleges and professional schools is 
greatly needed, the honest enforcement of the standards already adopted will 
go far toward the proper differentiation between the functions of the college 
and the high schools, and would tend toward their articulation rather than the 
overlapping, now so common. 
8. More generous provision for the training of teachers is a pressing need in 
the educational systems of many States. It will require the most effective work 
on the part of normal schools and the departments of education of the univer- 
sities to meet the extraordinary demand for teachers during the next two 
decades. Such work should, however, only be undertaken by institutions with 
adequate resources in income, equipment, and in teachers. 
CONFERENCE OF STATE SUPERVISORS OF WOMAN’S SCHOOL 
IMPROVEMENT WORK IN THE SOUTHERN STATES. 
The state supervisors of the woman’s school improvement work 
in the Southern States met in special conference at Atlanta April 14, 
1909, P. P. Claxton presiding. The following supervisors partici- 
pated in the conference: Mrs. B. B. Munford, Virginia; Mrs. Charles 
D. McIver, North Carolina; Miss Mary T. Nance, South Carolina; 
Mrs. Walter B. Hill, Georgia; Miss Susie V. Powell, Mississippi; 
Miss Agnes Morris, Louisiana; Mrs. Clio Harper, Arkansas; Miss 
Virginia P. Moore, Tennessee; Mrs. Thames, Alabama. The reports 
of the supervisors made an inspiring story of the work of the state 
associations with organization in the State, the county, the local 
center. The interest of the conference centered in the improvement 
of the country school, in making the school the center of community 
life where teachers, pupils, and parents become educated by doing 
things together. 
CONFERENCE ON UNIFORM ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS IN ENGLISH. 
The conference on uniform entrance requirements in English met 
on February 22, 1909, at Teachers College, Columbia University, for 
the purpose of preparing a revised statement of the uniform require- 
ment which it recommends to the various bodies which it represents. 
A special committee of the conference has been studying carefully 
for some months the various questions involved, and had been in 
communication with many associations, teachers, head masters, and 
professors. 
The changes of importance in the revision made by the conference 
are the following: 
1. The study of English grammar and rhetoric is further empha- 
sized, as is also the need of securing good English in all the student’s 
exercises and recitations.
-P-A-G-E-81
  EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS, CONFERENCES, ETC. 69 
2. A group of translations of the ancient classics—the Bible, the 
Iliad, the Odyssey, and the Aineid—is added to the books prescribed 
for reading. 
3. The division of the examination into preliminary and final is 
retained and emphasized. The main elements of the preliminary 
examination reappear in the final examination. 
4. Most important of all, the student’s skill in composition and his 
knowledge and appreciation of literature are, to a large extent, to 
be tested separately. The topics for composition, whether in the 
preliminary or the final examination, are no longer to be chosen 
entirely from the prescribed books. This last change is welcome and 
thrice-prayed for, but it must not be forgotten that the conference’s 
first requirement of fifteen years ago, whereby the study of composi- 
tion and that of literature were closely bound together, has had a 
far-reaching influence in encouraging the reading of the English 
classics in the secondary schools, and that it is only because this 
practice is thoroughly well established that a modification of the 
requirement is now wise. 
The conference has now established itself definitely as a permanent 
advisory body, and has adopted a constitution by which each of the 
following bodies is entitled to send delegates: The New England 
Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools, the similar asso- 
ciations of the Middle States and Maryland, of the North Central 
States, and of the Southern States, the conference of the New Eng- 
land Colleges on entrance requirements in English, and the College 
Entrance Examination Board. Additions to membership are also 
provided for. The present officers are, Prof. F. H. Stoddard, New 
York University, chairman; Prof. C. T. Winchester, Wesleyan 
University, vice-chairman; Principal Wilson Farrand, Newark 
Academy, secretary-treasurer. These officers, together with Prof. 
F. N. Scott, University of Michigan, and Prof. W. L. Cross, Yale 
University, constitute the executive committee. (Educational 
Review, April, 1909.) 
DENTAL FACULTIES ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES. 
The Dental Faculties Association of American Universities was 
organized at the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel, Philadelphia, Pa., on 
June 5, 1909, by representatives of Harvard University, University 
of California, University of Iowa, University of Michigan, Univer- 
sity of Minnesota, and University of Pennsylvania. 
The objects of the association are to promote dental education, to improve the 
standard of the preliminary education required for admission to dental schools, 
to establish reciprocal educational relations with its members and ultimately 
to establish a national standard, which may serve as the basis for a reciprocal 
interchange of dental licenses among the several States. The membership of  
-P-A-G-E-82
  70 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
this association is limited to dental schools which are integral parts of state 
universities or of chartered universities of equal standing of the United States, 
holding membership in tlie Association of American Universities, demanding 
graduation from accredited high schools, that require four years of high school 
work or the equivalent amount of education for matriculation. 
The officers of the association for the year 1909-10 are Dr. J. G. 
Sharp, University of California, Berkeley, Cal., president; Dr. Eugene 
H. Smith, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass., vice-president; 
Dr. Edward C. Kirk, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pa. 
EASTERN PUBLIC EDUCATION ASSOCIATION. 
This association is composed of volunteer organizations which 
have made successful attempts at securing humanitarian laws, such 
as laws providing for compulsory school attendance, free popular 
lectures, increase of teachers’ salaries, regulation of child labor, and 
improvements in the organization and management of schools. Its 
last meeting was held in Washington, September 28 to October 3, 
1908. Its object was a thorough discussion of the public school as 
a safeguard to public health, and in order to make this more impres- 
sive, the meeting was held in conjunction with the tuberculosis con- 
gress in Washington, held at the same time. The exhibition pre- 
pared for this congress was utilized to illustrate the lectures on school 
hygiene. The programme was varied and was carried out by the 
chairman, Supt. George I. Aldrich, of Brookline, Mass. The papers 
read dealt chiefly with the hygienic features of public education. 
The chief speakers were Dr. Pearce Kintzing, of Baltimore; Prof. 
A. Duncan Yocum, of Philadelphia; Mr. Milton Fairchild, of New 
York; Miss Julia Richman, of New York; Representative J. van 
Vechten Olcott, of New York; Dr. Adolph Knoph, of New York; 
Health Commissioner Thomas Darlington of New York; and others. 
The association resolved to extend its activity to the entire country 
and abandon the word “eastern” in its name and constitution. 
INTERCOLLEGIATE CIVIC LEAGUE: COMMONWEALTH CLUB OF THE 
UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN. 
[Statement made to the Bureau by Mr. Gustave W. Buchen.] 
The Commonwealth Club of the University of Wisconsin was 
organized in the spring of 1908 for the purpose, as its constitution 
states, “of developing higher ideals of social and political service 
among its members; and of arousing within the student body of the 
University of Wisconsin a lively interest in public affairs. 
The club is one which, with some 30 or 40 others in the leading col- 
leges and universities of the country, constitute the Intercollegiate 
Civic League. The central organization is located in New York City, 
but it acts only in an advisory capacity. The clubs make their own
-P-A-G-E-83
  
EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS, CONFERENCES, ETC. 1 
constitutions and rules, and outline their programmes, cooperating 
with the league only when some definite concerted action is necessary. 
Each year one or more delegates are sent to the national convention 
at New York, where the executive committee is elected and the reports 
of the work of the various clubs are made. 
The Commonwealth Club of the University of Wisconsin is closely 
connected with the department of political science, and members are 
selected with reference to reasonable scholarship combined with a 
keen interest in public affairs. The membership is limited to 40, 
not by thought of exclusiveness, but by a desire to secure capable, 
active men and an efficient working organization. The members are 
selected only from the junior and senior classes and from the graduate 
school. 
The officers for the ensuing year are as follows: President, Reuben 
McKitrick; vice-president, Raymond T. Zillmer; secretary-treasurer, 
Clarence C. Tolg. 
The work carried on by the various clubs in the Intercollegiate 
Civic League differs according to the communities in which they are 
located. Some of the clubs confine their activities to the student 
body, encouraging them, irrespective of party, to work and vote for 
worthy candidates for office. Other clubs in large cities cooperate 
with the good-government leagues in their fight against graft and cor- 
ruption. The Commonwealth Club of the University of Wisconsin 
has not extended its activities along these lines. Regular meetings 
were held during the year, at which papers were read and discussions 
held on subjects of vital political and social interest, with special 
reference to conditions in Wisconsin. Realizing, however, that this 
plan limited its field of usefulness, the club has decided on a new 
and broader course of action. By virtue of the close relation existing 
between the university and the State, the former is able to render 
valuable assistance in administrative work and in guiding the policies 
of the State for the good of the Commonwealth. At the special ses- 
sion of the legislature which is to be convened in January, 1910, sev- 
eral important matters are to come up for consideration, among them 
being guaranty of bank deposits, industrial insurance, income tax, 
and water power and dams. With a view to aiding in the considera- 
tion of these problems, the Commonwealth Club has been divided 
into four sections, each section to make a thorough study of one of the 
above-mentioned subjects. From time to time reports of their prog- 
ress will be made to the club, and finally the members will appear 
before the legislative committees and present the results of their in- 
vestigation. In this way the club hopes to be of direct service to the 
State by aiding it in progressive and scientific legislation. 
Nor are the larger aspects of a club of this kind to be overlooked. 
Our political system has become so complicated and oftentimes so
-P-A-G-E-84
  72 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
inefficient that enlightened democracy demands enlightened leaders. 
It is from our colleges and universities that the greatest portion of our 
future leaders is to come. It is therefore highly important that the 
college man be not only a trained man, but a man of steady purpose, 
stern resolves, and high ideals. These are the qualities which the 
Commonwealth Club seeks to instill in its members; and if its mis- 
sion is fulfilled, it will be a potent force in the fight for clean politics. 
NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION. 
  
Report of the Secretary to the Commissioner of Education. 
Winona, Minn., September 9, 1909. 
My Dzar Sir: By the provisions of section 4 of the act of incorpo- 
ration of the National Education Association by Congress, approved 
June 30, 1906, I am required to render to you, on behalf of the corpo- 
ration of said association, an annual report stating the amount of 
property, real and personal, held by the corporation, and the various 
receipts and expenditures during the past year. 
Iam submitting herewith such a report, as follows: 
The association holds as personal property approximately 10,000 
volumes of proceedings in the depository of the association at the 
office of the secretary in Winona, Minn., valued at $10,000; 5,000 
pamphlets and reprints, valued at $800; office furniture, cases, and 
equipment, valued at $500; total personal property at Winona, 
$11,300. 
An office is maintained in the city of Washington at 1860 Fairmont 
street, in accordance with section 8 of the act of incorporation, but 
the association owns no property, real or personal, in the city of 
Washington. 
The business of the association is transacted at the office established 
by authority of the board of directors at Winona, Minn. 
The association has a permanent invested fund, referred to in sec- 
tion 7 of the act of incorporation, which is the charge of the board of 
trustees. This fund, at the close of the last fiscal year, June 30, 1909, 
amounted to $170,000, as per the accompanying Exhibit A, which 
constitutes the twenty-third annual report of the board of trustees. 
You will note that the net revenue from this fund amounted to 
$6,743.17, which was transferred to the treasury of the association 
for current expenses. 
The fiscal year of the association is from July 1 to the following 
June 30, the last fiscal year closing June 30, 1909. For this last 
fiscal year the total receipts for current expenses from all sources
-P-A-G-E-85
EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS, CONFERENCES, ETC. 73 
were $37,418.67; the total expenses for the year were $33,609.67; 
leaving a balance in the treasury June 30, 1909, of $3,809. 
The chief sources of revenue are: 
Membership fees; 
Proceeds of sale of volumes and reports; 
Revenue from the invested fund. 
The chief sources of expense of the association are: 
The printing and distribution of the annual volumes; 
The maintenance of the secretary’s office and clerical force 
at Winona, Minn.; 
The expense of preparing for and conducting the annual 
convention. 
While a large part of the revenue comes from the associate mem- 
bership fees received at the annual convention, a still larger amount 
comes as annual dues of $2 for each member from the 6,000 active 
(permanent) members of the association. 
The last convention of the association, held at Denver July 3 to 
9, was in every respect successful; but no special action was taken 
which would probably be deemed essential or important to embody 
in this report. 
I am, respectfully, yours, 
Irwin Sueparp, Secretary.

Commissioner of Education of the United States,

The report is signed by the trustees as follows: Nicholas Murray Butler, James M. 
Greenwood, Henry B. Brown, Carroll G. Pearse, and Lorenzo D. Harvey. 
The total registration of the Denver convention (the forty-seventh) 
was about 6,000. While, therefore, not the largest in point of num- 
bers, it was one of the most important in its results, and particularly 
in the stimulus given to industrial education. The three great 
features of the convention were those bearing upon industrialism, 
hygiene, and morals in education. These have become permanent 
factors in the educational system of the United States and will con- 
tinue to occupy the highest rank. 
The following officers were elected for the ensuing year: Presi- 
dent, State Supt. James Y. Joyner, of North Carolina; vice-presi- 
dents, Lorenzo D. Harvey, of Wisconsin (the outgoing president), 
Harvey B. Work, of West Virginia, Mrs. Katherine M. Cook, of 
Colorado, W. M. Holloway, of Florida, M. B. Stevens, of Maryland, 
W. J. Kerr, of Oregon, T. H. Harris, of Louisiana, F. B. Dyer, of 
Cincinnati, and L. E. Wolf; treasurer, Arthur H. Chamberlain. 
Irwin Shepard remains secretary, having been given that office for life. 
A vote taken by the directors favored San Francisco as the place 
of next year’s meeting. 
DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES AND AIMS, 
The following declaration of principles and of aims was made by 
the association in convention assembled : 
The National Education Association, now holding its forty-seventh annual 
convention in Denver, representing teachers and friends of education in every 
State of the Union, makes the following declaration of principles and of aims: 
1. A free democracy can not long continue without the assistance of a system 
of state-supported schools, administered by the chosen agents of the people and 
responsible to the people for its ideals, its conduct, and its results. The com-
-P-A-G-E-87
  
EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS, CONFERENCES, ETC. 75 
manding position of the American people is largely due to the general diffusion 
of knowledge and culture by its free schools. 
2. Our system of state-supported schools must include elementary schools, 
secondary schools, schools for the training of teachers, and state universities. 
The changed conditions of the twentieth century also demand the establishment 
of free schools whose purpose shall be the training of our youth for commerce 
and the industries, as well as for the professions. 
8. The purpose of our system of free common schools must continue to be 
chiefly culture for the individual and the transmission to posterity of the results 
of investigations and deliberations of the past. Our free schools must advance 
along the lines of educational democracy in the sense that they must provide 
equal educational opportunities for all. Although they must give practical 
preparation, not only for the professions but also for commercial life, the 
demands of any part of the business world that courses of study be subordinated 
to particular interests is not in accord with the proper aims of a national system 
of common schools. 
4, A system of common schools that will meet the needs of the times must be 
democratic in its purpose and its administration; must recognize the importance 
of expert supervision, of better and more numerous high schools, of better and 
more numerous schools for the training of teachers, of a merit system for the 
appointment and promotion of teachers; and it must exclude fraternities and 
secret organizations of every sort from the social life of the school. 
5. The common schools of our country must recognize more fully than ever 
the necessity of training our youth for citizenship. The perpetuation of democ- 
racy depends upon the existence in the people of that habit of will which is 
justice. Liberty under law is the process for attaining justice which has thus 
far been most successful among civilized men. The call to citizenship is a call 
to the exercise of liberty under law, a call to the limitation of liberty by law, 
and a call to the pursuit of justice, not only for one’s self but for others. 
6. The National Education Association indorses the purpose of the American 
School Peace League. The association believes that the principles of the league 
‘will make for effective citizenship, and urges all teachers to acquaint themselves 
with the work of the league and to cooperate with it. 
7. The increased tendency to congestion of population in cities makes neces- 
sary greater and more systematic attention to the physical development of 
our children. No vigorous race of people has long maintained a high state of 
civilization under conditions that did not take into consideration the physical 
as well as the mental and moral development of its youth. The association 
recommends that provision be made by the United States Bureau of Education 
for effective promotion of physical education through the diffusion of scientific 
information on this subject. 
8. The National Education Association approves the ever-increasing demand 
for better qualified teachers in the common schools. This higher standard must 
lead logically to a longer tenure and to a compensation more nearly commen- 
surate with the quality of preparation and with the nature of the service 
rendered. 
9. The National Education Association heartily indorses the use of school 
buildings and all school equipment for community interests and social better- 
ment. 
10. The Nationai Education Association indorses the movement to consoli- 
date the rural district schools wherever practicable, and expresses the hope 
that this movement will be encouraged until the children of rural communities 
enjoy the benefits of public education to an extent approximating those now 
supplied to children of urban communities,

eral Education Board, and all associations, institutions, and organizations that

REORGANIZATION OF DEPARTMENTS. 
The committee on reorganization of departments, Alfred Bayliss, 
chairman, presented to the board a report containing a number of 
recommendations which, as finally amended, read to the following 
effect: 
First. That the department of school administration be consolidated with 
the department of superintendence; the department of child study with the 
department of normal schools; the department of business education and science 
instruction with the department of secondary education; the departments of 
art education and manual training and of rural and agricultural education 
with the department of technical education, and the department of kinder- 
garten education with the department of elementary education. 
It further recommends that the department of special education and the 
library department be discontinued as such, their subjects being intimately 
associated with the other subjects of elementary, secondary, and higher 
education. 
Second. That the department of Indian education be cordially invited to 
continue to hold its meetings with the National Education Association, and to 
maintain an affiliated relation corresponding to that of other societies and 
associations now meeting with this association. 
Third. That the consolidated department of child study and normal schools 
be hereafter designated as the “department of professional preparation of 
teachers.” 
Fourth. That the department which shall include art education, manual 
training, rural and agricultural education, technical instruction, and domestic 
science (the last named not represented as such in the present organization) 
be designated as the “ department of industrial education.” 
Fifth. That the department of women’s organizations be designated as the 
“department of school patrons.” 
Sixth. That the regular departments of. this association be as follows until 
otherwise ordered by the board of directors: 
1, The national council of education. 
. The department of superintendence. 
The department of professional preparation of teachers. 
. The department of elementary education. 
. The department of secondary education.

TRAVELING SCHOLARSHIPS. 77 
At a meeting of the new board of directors, held July 8, 1909, the 
committee on traveling scholarships reported that, in view of the 
uncertainty of the financial outlook of the association, no appropria- 
tion for traveling scholarships could be made at that session.

NORTH CAROLINA COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS’ ASSOCIATION. 
[The annual meeting of the North Carolina County Superintendents’ Association was held 
at Hendersonville August 31 to September 3, 1909. The following information regarding 
the meeting was communicated to the Commissioner of Education by Dr. Wickliffe Rose, 
general agent of the Peabody education fund.] 
1. The meeting was called, arranged, and conducted by the state 
superintendent of education. Attendance on the part of county 
superintendents is required; each county bears the expense of its 
superintendent. 
2. There are 98 counties in the State; there were 89 superintend- 
ents present at this meeting. 
3. They were in session five hours a day for three days. All were 
present all the time. It was a business meeting from beginning to 
end. 
4. There were no addresses; the discussion of each topic came to 
final definition in a clear-cut, practical programme of activities. 
5. To the state department of education has been added a state 
supervisor of teacher training. Mr. Bivins, the present incumbent, 
had charge of the discussion of Topic I, “ Teacher training.” The 
discussion was devoted to defining a plan for improving the teachers 
now in the service. The outline in the programme suggestssthe plan 
which he proposes to put into operation in all the counties of the 
State. 
6. Another recent addition to the state department of education is 
the state inspector of elementary rural schools. For the present 
this work is to be maintained by the Peabody fund. Mr. Brogden 
has been appointed and began his work at this meeting. He led the 
discussion of Topic II, “Supervision and inspection of elementary 
schools.” 
7. The secretary of the state board of health was present and 
opened the discussion of Topic III, “ Public health and the public 
school as a factor in the promotion of it.” A number of physicians 
were present. There is no more live question in North Carolina 
to-day than this one of public health. The schools are taking it up 
with an earnestness that promises definite and far-reaching results. 
The school-improvement leagues are organizing a campaign against 
the fly, the mosquito, the hook-worm, typhoid, and tuberculosis. 
8. The state high-school inspector conducted the discussion on 
“ Public high schools” (Topic IV). The whole time was devoted to
-P-A-G-E-91
  
EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS, CONFERENCES, ETC. 79 
clearing up points of difficulty which had arisen in the practical 
administration of these schools. With the system only 3 years old, 
the State now has 176 high schools in operation. The feature of this 
discussion was the active and intelligent way in which the county 
superintendents are beginning to handle this new problem of super- 
vision. 
9. Another recent addition to the state department of education 
is a supervisor of agricultural education. This work is identified 
with the state department and the Agricultural and Mechanical Col- 
lege, and is supported by the General Education Board. The business 
of this man will be to organize the teaching of agriculture in the 
public schools. This man conducted the discussion of Topic V, 
“ Agricultural instruction.” 
This meeting is significant as indicating growth in supervision in 
the South. The state high-school inspector, the state inspector of 
elementary rural schools, the state supervisor of teacher training, 
the supervisor of agricultural education are so many new arms by 
which the state department of public instruction is reaching out 
and laying its hands upon the details of the State’s educational busi- 
ness. This meeting of county superintendents with state superin- 
tendent and state supervisors in a three-day business session for the 
clearing up of practical problems of administration marks a long 
step forward in efficient business methods. 
A meeting similar to this was held in August at Farmville, Va. 
PLAYGROUND ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA. 
The Third Annual Congress of the Playground Association of 
America was held at Pittsburg, Pa., May 10-14, 1909. Eighty-five 
cities in all were represented at the congress by 281 delegates, each 
of whom was accredited either directly by a municipality, an active 
playground association, a city park board, a board of trade, or some 
other organization directly concerned with the local extension and 
improvement of playground facilities. 
Among the committee reports made to the congress was that of 
the committee on normal courses in play, which reported a tentative 
normal course; it is expected that this will be crystallized into a 
definite working curriculum, which many normal schools and uni- 
versity departments will offer in whole or in part. The committees 
on folk dancing and story telling endeavored to meet the demand 
for information in those matters by supplying lists of dances, music, 
stories, etc., together with complete bibliographies. A new applica- 
tion of organized play—the use of playground games and exercises 
and the social group system of the playground as a remedial agency 
in hospitals for epileptics and the insane, as well as a method of 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
  80 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
achieving voluntary order and discipline in orphan asylums, cus- 
todial institutions, and reformatories—was strongly advised by the 
committee on play in institutions. 
In connection with the congress there was held a conference of 
municipal representatives for the purpose of discussing the ques- 
tion of a “safer, saner Fourth of July;” 45 municipalities were repre- 
sented by delegates at this conference. Among the points noted 
by the secretary in a general summing up of the sense of the con- 
ference was the following: : 
We indorse all movements for safe and sane civic celebrations, and it is 
the sense of this meeting that the Playground Association of America should 
aid such movements in a constructive way by preparing and distributing pro- 
grammes for civic celebrations of Independence Day and other public holidays. 
In addition to the municipal conference, there was a second spirited 
meeting, conducted by delegates from the various branches of the 
Young Men’s Christian Association. The objects of the conference, 
as stated in the call for the meeting, were: (1) To consider what the 
Young Men’s Christian Association has done and can do to promote 
playgrounds, either directly or in cooperation with other civic bodies; 
and (2) to review the work for athletics for boys and to determine 
the future policy which should be followed. 
A play festival held on the concluding day of the congress exhib- 
ited the unwonted spectacle of 18,000 children playing organized 
games on a great playground nearly a mile square, while 50,000 other 
children and adults looked on and thoroughly enjoyed the sports of 
the little players. This festival showed in practice four important 
phases of playground life: (a) The free play of children; (0) the 
spirited athletic contests between teams of boys, in which playground, 
school, neighborhood, and team loyalty is strongly in evidence; 
(c) folk dancing on the lawns; and (d) the dramatic pageant, used 
as a means of instilling pride in city and country. 
While this great play festival was both in point of numbers and 
elaborateness of programme the chief exhibition feature, three other 
festivals and exhibitions illustrating certain phases of playground 
work are also worthy of special mention. One of these festivals 
dealt with games for little children; the second showed what could 
be accomplished in industrial and art training in the regular play- 
grounds, and how these studies could be made certain rivals of ordi- 
nary play; the third festival demonstrated how under proper train- 
ing vocal music could be made a most effective feature of recreation- 
center work. 
The following information, showing the progress of the playground 
movement and illustrating some of the different directions it is
-P-A-G-E-93
ee 
EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS, CONFERENCES, ETC. 81 
taking, is compiled from the report of Henry S. Curtis, secretary of 
the congress: 
The growth of the last few months has been many-sided. The cities generally 
are appropriating considerably more money for maintenance than they did last 
year. In many cities the season is being extended in the school playgrounds to 
include a considerable part of the school year as well as the vacation. There 
is a general tendency to lengthen the playground day so as to include the after- 
noon and evening session, and there has been a great increase of interest in the 
School as a social center. 
The tendency among wealthy men to contribute memorial playgrounds to 
home cities, which began to be noticeable last year, has increased until there is 
now a large number of such playgrounds. 
Throughout the country probably the most significant single event has been 
the Massachusetts playground law. This is essentially a local-option law. It 
has required every city of 10,000 or more inhabitants to vote as to whether 
or not it would maintain playgrounds. Thus far 42 cities have voted, and 40 
have voted favorably. The State of New Jersey passed an enabling act in 1907 
and the State of Ohio in 1908. A law has been passed in the last few days by 
the State of Minnesota permitting cities of 50,000 inhabitants to issue bonds to 
the extent of $100,000 to acquire and improve sites for playgrounds. Playground 
laws are now pending before the legislatures of the States of Montana and 
Indiana. 
A very significant movement during the last eight months has been the 
tendency of the various municipalities to form playground commissions to look 
into the needs of the cities and make plans for the future. Some of the cities 
that have appointed such commissions are Minneapolis, San Francisco, Oakland, 
Berkeley, Philadelphia, and New York. A movement that has been begun 
during the past few months is a movement to correlate all the work for chil- 
- dren through a juvenile commission. Such a commission has been recently 
organized in Hartford. Of even greater interest in idea is the new recreation 
commission of New York City, though it is still in the initial stage. This is of 
great interest, because it plans to inventory all the recreational facilities of the 
city and try to make them adequate to actual needs. 
A very interesting experiment has been tried in Buffalo in the way of organ- 
izing tramping trips with the playground children. The school journey, which 
often takes the children off on‘walking trips which last two or three weeks, 
is very popular in Germany, and is one of the things regularly promoted by 
the German association. Such trips are also conducted on an extensive scale 
by the People’s Palace of London. The Chicago Playground Association has 
been conducting similar trips for the last two years, but there they are for 
the adults instead of children. 
One of the most suggestive things along the line of equipment -is the report 
of Mr. L. W. Rapeer of the work that has been done by his school in Minne- 
apolis. The school has made all of an extensive equipment for its own play- 
ground. Such a playground is worth far more to the children than any play- 
ground that can be bought. 
The congress adopted the following summary statement of its 
beliefs and its sphere of work: | 
We believe that the main work of this association as an association should be 
not the promotion of playgrounds, but of the ideals of the movement. : 
9228—xp 1909—vor 1——6    
-P-A-G-E-94
  82 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
We take as our proper province the promotion of the play spirit and play 
opportunities everywhere for all ages and both sexes. We believe that there 
are very many other play opportunities essential to the development of child 
and community life besides those offered by the normal playground, and we 
regard the making available for play the dooryards, vacant lots, streets, interior 
of the blocks, and the roofs of tenements, armories, and other suitable buildings 
as no less important than the playgrounds themselves. 
We regard the promotion of play festivals, picnics, tramps, summer camps, 
the school journey, play periods in connection with the school, and all sorts 
of activities that call the people to a recreative life in the open air as legiti- 
mate objects of our endeavor. 
We believe, also, that we should aim to show to the modern factory and 
business world ways in which the grinding drudgery of monotonous conditions 
can be relieved by recreational elements which may add a play interest to 
work. 
RELIGIOUS EDUCATION ASSOCIATION. 
The Sixth General Convention of the Religious Education Asso- 
ciation was held in Chicago, February 7-13, 1909. Over 40 separate 
meetings were held and 118 addresses delivered and papers read. - 
Resolutions were adopted, among others, (a) affirming the necessity 
of industrial education, not only for economic reasons, but also to 
humanize industrial life, always with the understanding that in 
conducting it the primacy of the moral aim is to be recognized, and 
the development of character held in view; (0) urging upon colleges, 
universities, and theological seminaries the establishment of courses 
looking toward the preparation of teachers of religion. 
Among the activities of the association during the year 1908 have 
been, (1) the Washington convention, with 27 important meetings; 
(2) over 200 conferences and institutes on moral and religious train- 
ing; (3) the publication of a volume of 350 pages, entitled “ Educa- 
tion and National Character;” (4) the promotion of special work 
by the departments; (5) ‘increased cooperation with general denomi- 
national and educational societies looking toward improvements in 
moral and religious training; (6) the maintenance of the work of the 
bureau of information, answering inquiries and aiding teachers, 
schools, churches, etc.; (7) development of the library and permanent 
exhibit, including its removal to quarters at the very heart of 
Chicago; (8) strengthening the membership numerically; (9) a 
financial campaign which has practically ended the long struggle 
with old debts; (10) extensive preparations for the sixth general 
convention. 
Prof. George Albert Coe, of Northwestern University, was elected 
president of the association for 1909, and Mr. Henry Frick Cope, of 
Chicago, general secretary. Nashville was selected for the 1910 
meeting.

COMMITTEE ON WEEK-DAY RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION. 
The Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in America, at its 
last meeting in Philadelphia, December 2-8, 1908, passed the follow- 
ing resolution: 
We hereby invite the National Education Association and the Religious Edu- 
cation Association to appoint committees to confer with the committee of this 
body, to be appointed by its executive committee, made up of at least one mem- 
ber from each of the constituent bodies of this council, for the full consideration 
of ways and means to promote week-day religious instruction; the committee 
of this council to report to the executive committee, and at the next meeting of 
the federal council. 
In accordance with this action committees were appointed by the 
Federal Council and the Religious Education Association, and a 
preliminary meeting of the joint committee was held at Chautauqua, 
N. Y., July 15-16, 1909, with Mr. Henry F. Cope as secretary. Con- 
cerning this meeting Mr. Cope writes to the bureau: 
The following persons were present: Rev. W. H. Boocock, Prof. G. A. Coe, 
Rey. E. B. Sanford, Prof. C. W. Votaw, President A. T. Perry, and H. F. Cope. 
Doubtless on account of the meeting following so closely the National Educa- 
tion Association convention no official representatives of the National Education 
Association were present. A temporary organization was determined on by the 
election of the presidents of the committees from the three bodies, namely, the 
Federal Council, the National Education Association, and the Religious Edu- 
cation Association, as an executive committee with authority to call a joint 
committee meeting and, preceding this meeting, to conduct the necessary corre- 
spondence with reference to several lines of investigation which were proposed. 
REQUIREMENTS FOR ADMISSION INTO THEOLOGICAL SCHOOLS, 
While theological schools do not always announce the requirement 
of a bachelor’s degree for admission, they usually indicate clearly 
that for the full and regular courses of instruction graduation from 
college or equivalent education is necessary. In fact the regular 
courses, which include Hebrew, Greek, etc., could not be pursued suc- 
cessfully without a collegiate education. Promising students with 
less education may be admitted to special courses, and for such stu- 
dents English courses are provided in a few schools, but those who 
wish to complete the full regular course must be college graduates. 
Catholic students receive instruction in both philosophy and theology 
in the same school. 
RURAL LIFE CONFERENCE HELD AT THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. 
A conference was held at the University of Virginia summer school 
in 1908 to discuss the problems of rural life. The success of this con- 
ference led to the calling of a second one, which was held at the same 
   
-P-A-G-E-96
  84 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
school July 138-16, 1909. Aided by the interest in the subject devel- 
oped by the Federal Commission on Country Life, the conference was 
able to bring together a most interesting group of speakers. Ad- 
dresses were given upon the following subjects: “ Possibilities of 
extension work in Virginia;” “The country school and its neigh- 
bors;” “ Rural life attractiveness;” “ Extension work in the West;” 
“School extension;” “ Boys’ and girls’ clubs;” “The traveling 
school; ” “Forestry and conservation of resources; ” “ School agri- 
culture in its relation to the community; ” “ The agricultural revolu- 
tion—what it means and how it is to be brought about;” “A prac- 
tical lesson in agriculture; ” “A cooking lesson in a country school; ” 
“How to reduce the death rate among farm children from typhoid 
and anemia; ” “Adulteration of foods.” 
SOUTHERN ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGE WOMEN. 
The Southern Association of College Women held two meetings at 
Atlanta, April 15 and 16, 1909, in connection with the Twelfth Con- 
ference for Education in the South. The meetings were well attended. 
In addition to a word of greeting from Mrs. John King Ottley, 
speaking for the club women of Atlanta, and from Miss Emily 
McVea, Dr. Lillian W. Johnson, and Miss Celeste Parish, repre- 
senting the founders of the association, the following subjects were 
discussed: “'The physical betterment of school children,” by Miss 
Edith Howe, chairman committee on physical welfare of school 
children, National Congress of Mothers; “A plan for concerted work 
in education by the club women of five national organizations,” by 
Dr. Laura Drake Gill, president of the Association of Collegiate 
Alumne; “ Tlliteracy and compulsory school attendance laws,” by 
Dr. Elmer Ellsworth Brown, United States Commissioner of Educa- 
tion. President of the association, Mrs. Emma Garrett Boyd, At- 
lanta; secretary-treasurer, Miss Eula Denton, San Antonio. (Pro- 
ceedings of the conference.) 
SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
The Southern Educational Association met at Atlanta, Ga., De- 
cember 29-31, 1908. Among the topics that were given prominence 
in the proceedings were: “ Improvement of public schoolhouses and 
grounds; ” “'The high school; ” “ Education of the negro; ” “ Voca- 
tional education ;” “ Secondary agricultural education in the Southern 
States ;” “ Education and public health.” Resolutions were adopted 
favoring public industrial education; recommending a broader and. 
higher training for teachers; appreciating the work of voluntary 
organizations that cooperate with educators in improving the social 
and physical conditions of the school population; indorsing the sani-
-P-A-G-E-97
  
EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS, CONFERENCES, ETC. 85 
‘tary supervision of schools; and approving the Davis bill, to grant 
federal aid to agricultural high schools. 
Secretary H. E. Bierly writes that— 
The meetings of the board of directors were largely given to the development 
of the organization and the formulation of plans for active and effective work. 
The board organized a southern educational council, composed of 30 of the 
ablest educators in the South, which will have for one of its main objects the 
making and publishing of investigations by special committees appointed for 
this purpose, together with the formulation of the policy of the association. 
An organizing committee consisting of Prof. P. P. Claxton, chair- 
man, President D. B. Johnson, and President J. W. Abercrombie 
was appointed. The principal officers for 1909 are Supt. James H. 
Van Sickle, Baltimore, Md., president; Prof. H. E. Bierly Chatta- 
nooga, Tenn., secretary. The following statement of the organiza- 
tion, field of work, and activities of the association is taken from a 
circular issued in the summer of 1909: 
PLACE AND DATE OF NEXT MEETING, AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE 
ORGANIZATION. 
The next meeting of the Southern Educational Association will be held at 
Charlotte, N. C., on December 28, 29, and 30, 1909, in response to cordial 
invitations from the educators of the State and the citizens of Charlotte. This 
promises to be the largest, most important, and notable educational gathering 
that ever assembled in the South. It is the first meeting to be held since the 
extensive and complete organization of the association recently effected. The 
last meeting at Atlanta, during the Christmas holidays, was the largest and best 
in its history. Hitherto the organization has had few departments devoted to 
special lines of work, but realizing that it was not so active and effective as it 
should be in organizing the educational forces and in developing educational 
literature adapted to southern needs and conditions, and that it had great pos- 
sibilities, opportunities, and obligations in this constructive period of southern 
education, the association now has developed an organization almost as exten- 
sive as the National Educational Association. 
ITS TERRITORY AND DEPARTMENTS. 
The Southern Educational Association has for its special territory the States 
of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mis- 
sissippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas. 
Virginia, and West Virginia, and District of Columbia, and has the following 
departments: Southern educational council, department of higher education, 
department of secondary education, department of normal education, department 
of superintendence, department of manual and industrial education, depart- 
ment of higher technical education, department of drawing and art, department 
of physical education, department of libraries, department of child study, de- 
partment of kindergarten, department of music, and department of the southern 
organizations of women. | 
DEPARTMENT OF COOPERATIVE COMMITTEES. 
Besides increasing the number of departments the association has just ap- 
pointed cooperative committees for each of its departments, so that the depart- 
ments are actively represented by 15 individuals in each State, each of whom
-P-A-G-E-98
  86 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
is the leading specialist in that State in the work of his department. It is the 
duty of members of cooperative committees to work up the special phase of 
education in their respective States and help the president of the department 
in developing the best plans and in selecting the best persons and subjects for 
the annual programme. 
COMPILATION OF ‘BIOGRAPHICAL EDUCATIONAL DIRECTORY OF SOUTH- 
. ERN STATES. 
The association is also compiling a biographical educational directory of the 
Southern States only, by means of which it will learn directly the special edu- 
cational ability and lines of past, present, and future interest, study, or re- 
search in which men and women of special ability are engaged, some of whom 
are not yet so widely known and all of whom the association needs. Thus, by 
means of the biographical educational directory and the cooperative committees, 
special educational ability is found out, organized, and more fully utilized than 
it otherwise would be by the association in its work in advancing the cause of 
education. The association is conducting an extensive and vigorous campaign 
to increase its membership, and is meeting with great success, as a large num- 
ber have identified themselves with the organization since the last meeting. 
SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS AND REPORTS. 
The association has just organized a southern educational council, composed 
of 30 of the ablest educators in the South, which will have as one of its main 
objects the making and publishing of investigations by special committees 
appointed for this purpose, together with the formulation of the policy of the 
association. What is greatly needed is more correct knowledge of southern 
educational conditions. These investigations and reports will be valuable con- 
tributions to southern educational literature. 
THE PROGRAMME. 
The officers of the association are arranging one of the best and most 
attractive programmes both for the general sessions, which are held during 
the forenoons and nights, and the department meetings, which are held in the 
afternoons. Some of the very ablest educators in our country have accepted 
invitations to participate in the discussion of the larger civic and general 
educational problems of the general sessions as well as in professional aspects 
of education in the department meetings. Several southern governors, United 
States Senators, Members of Congress, and a few Huropean ambassadors will 
honor the association with addresses. Among the subjects that will be dis- 
cussed in the general sessions are the following: Educational ideals and 
problems of the new South as compared with the old South, the industrial 
development of the South, the development of southern rural life and the 
public schools in relation to it, the movement for the improvement of school- 
houses and grounds, the call for educational citizenship, national aid to southern 
schools, educational legislation and progress during the year, the trend of 
state administration of public schools, present status of illiteracy in the 
Southern States, methods of state and local taxation for public schools, present 
conception of negro education in the South, methods of educational campaigns, 
the service of the state university, present status of college education, higher 
education of women, the movement for the education of adults, the supervision 
of rural schools, the improvement of teachers in the South, southern summer

schools, development of rural high schools, secondary agricultural education 
in the South, secondary education in Europe, Huropean and American trade 
schools, ete. | 
EDUCATIONAL EXHIBITS. 
One of the most effective means of education is through carefully selected 
exhibits. The most progressive southern universities, colleges, and normal 
schools will make exhibits as to their equipments, special facilities, etc., bear- 
ing especially upon the professional preparation of teachers in secondary and 
elementary schools. Some of the most progressive southern industrial high 
and elementary schools, also several kindergarten schools, will exhibit the work 
done in their schools. The exhibits in general will be closely related to the 
different departments of the association, with considerable attention to the 
professional preparation of teachers, industrial education, ete. They will 
exhibit in the line of architecture, equipment, courses of instruction, etc., of 
higher institutions, normal schools, high schools, industrial schools, agricul- 
tural schools, ete. Apparatus for the examination of defective hearing, seeing, 
lung capacity, fatigue, etc., will be on exhibit and children examined by a 
specialist. 
OTHER ORGANIZATIONS MEETING WITH THE SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL 
ASSOCIATION. 
The following organizations will meet with the Southern Educational Asso- 
ciation: Southern Society of Philosophy and Psychology, Religious Educational 
Association, American School Peace League, Southern Association for the 
Improvement of Public School Houses and Grounds, ete. Among the associa- 
tions that will be also invited are the following: Association of State Super- 
intendents of the Southern States, Southern Association of College Women, 
Editorial Press, Association of the Southern States, ete.

-EDUCATION. 
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF STATE UNIVERSITIES. 
The thirteenth annual meeting of the National Association of State 
Universities was held at Washington, D. C., November 15-16, 1908. 
The committee on recognition of the state universities by the Car- 
negie Foundation submitted a report detailing the progress of their 
endeavors to secure such recognition, and announcing their final suc- 
cess. The state universities are now placed in the same relation to 
the foundation as private institutions, except that they are subject to 
the following conditions: 
In the case of tax-supported institutions the applications must be accompanied 
by the approval of the governor, and of the legislature of the State or province 
in which the institution is situated. The trustees of the foundation reserve 
the right to decline the application of any such institution if it is subject to a 
political control or interference which, in the opinion of the trustees of the 
foundation, impairs its educational efficiency. A tax-supported institution must 
be in receipt of an annual income of not less than $100,000. 
Through the munificence of Mr. Carnegie, $5,000,000 have been 
added to the endowment of the foundation, to meet the increased 
demands that will be made upon it through this action. 
REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON STANDARDS. 
The committee on standards of American universities made at this 
meeting of the association its first full report. The committee had 
originally been appointed in 1905 under a resolution that read: 
That a committee be appointed that shall report later to this body upon 
standards for the recognition of American universities and upon standards for 
the recognition of the A. B. degree and higher degrees. 
The report of the committee, after having been debated at great 
length and amended in certain particulars, in its final form as 
adopted by the association contained the following statements and 
recommendation : 
Your committee believe that there are certain clearly marked tendencies or 
forces at work in our American society toward the development at no distant 
date of a typical institution of learning which we may not improperly call the 
standard American university. 
This institution will, for an indefinite time, include as an important part of 
its organization what we may call a standard American college with a four 
years’ curriculum with a tendency to differentiate its parts in such a way that 
the first two years will be looked upon as a continuation of and a supplement to 
the work of secondary instruction as given in the high school, while the last two 
years will be shaped more and more distinctly in the direction of special, 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
  
UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES—-HIGHER EDUCATION. 89 
advanced, or university instruction, rising gradually into the advanced work 
of the graduate school. 
The standard American university will also include as a distinct department 
the graduate school or philosophical faculty. 
It will also include as organic parts of the institution, in its fully developed 
form, various professional schools, such as law, medicine, and engineering. 
Present tendencies point, in our opinion, then, to a definite differentiation in 
the work of the college at the close of the sophomore year toward university 
work in the real sense. If these views are just, we suggest the following formu- 
Jation of principles underlying the organization of such an institution, and we 
may define the standard American university to be an institution— 
1. Which requires for admission the completion of the curriculum of a stand- 
ard American high school with a four years’ course, or, if you prefer the state- 
ment, the completion of a course which will enable the pupils to offer for ad- 
mission not less than 14 units of five periods each, or their equivalent. 
2. Which offers in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences two years of gen- 
eral or liberal work completing or supplementing the work of the high school. 
3. Which offers a further course of two years so arranged that the student 
may begin work of university character, leading to the bachelor’s degree at the 
end, and reaching forward to the continuation of this work in the graduate 
school or the professional school. 
4, Which offers professional courses in law or medicine or engineering, based 
upon the completion of two years of college work. 
5. Which offers in the graduate school an adequate course leading to the de- 
gree of doctor of philosophy. 
It is recommended that this association recognize any institution, in whole or 
in part, doing work of this grade as, in so far, doing work of university quality. 
In recommending that university work begin with the junior year of the col- 
lege, and that the professional schools be based on the first two years of college, 
the report is in line with present tendencies. It is in accord with the growing 
belief that the work of the last two years of college should be organized into 
groups that aim at more definite results and lead to greater efficiency. But this 
is only the first of many problems. (We are facing questions of the time be- 
yond the junior year for attaining the Ph. D. degree, of adjusting the scheme of 
counting the last two years toward both arts and professional degrees, of the 
place of the A. B. degree, of the age when the period of general education 
should end, and of a possible reorganization of elementary and secondary edu- 
cation. But these questions are not ready for solution and hardly belong to the 
work of the committee at the present time. 
It is to be noted that the definition of standards in terms of time are used as a 
matter of convenience, but there shall be due opportunity in individual cases to 
show equivalents. In the definition of units, it is recommended for collegiate 
entrance requirements that we recognize those now current in the North Cen- 
tral Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools and in similar associations, 
and those that have been indorsed by such associations which have come from 
associations of experts, and those in use by the college entrance requirements 
board. 
I. It is recommended that not less than sixty year-hours or units of collegiate 
work be required for the bachelor’s degree. 
II. Qualifications of teachers and institutional facilities.—It is expected that 
the scholastic qualifications of the teachers in the high schools should be not 
less than the bachelor’s degree or the equivalent, and it is recommended that it 
be a master’s degree. As a rule, the professors of all grades in the collegiate  
-P-A-G-E-102
  90 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
work shall have the degree of doctor of philosophy or its equivalent. The pro- 
fessors giving the instruction in graduate work are expected to show, in addi- 
tion to the possession of a doctor’s degree or its equivalent, their scholastic 
ability by successful research and publication, and above all, they must have 
demonstrated that they have power as teachers to inspire the students with zeal 
for research. Indeed, it is understood that all the teachers should possess the 
power of imparting knowledge and of character building. In addition, the pro- 
fessors in the professional schools should give evidence of doing investigative 
work, and those in technical schools the power of practical research. 
Ill. Equipment.—1. There should be adequate general and departmental 
libraries with: 
(@) Sufficient equipment in the way of duplicate books for purposes of under- 
graduate instruction. 
(b) Where graduate work is offered, books, monographs, and other materials 
for purposes of research. 
2. Modern laboratories and apparatus, with sufficient supervision for the 
undergraduate teaching, are demanded, and where graduate work is offered, 
research laboratories, 
(In the use of the term “ laboratories” we include not only those for the ma- 
terial sciences, with opportunity for proper field work, but also museums and 
the proper laboratories for the educational, political, and social sciences.) 
IV. Time units for degrees.—Institutions providing for advanced work shall 
require three years, or 45 units, from the beginning of the junior year for the 
degree of master of arts, and five years, or 75 units, for the degree of doctor of 
philosophy, and with work in residence. The units are not necessarily schedule 
hours in graduate work, but their equivalent, and include credit for research 
and thesis work. It of course is understood that from the beginning of the 
junior year there is the adoption of the group system suggested by the honor 
schools in English universities or the separate faculties in the German univer- 
sities, and that the kind of instruction contemplates investigation—in short, 
science with power—as the purpose. It is the intent that the cultural atmos- 
phere shall pervade the work of the student who begins specialization, and that 
something of the spirit of discovery and the earnestness it brings shall affect 
the cultural temper. 
V. Scope of curriculum.—To be a standard university an institution shall 
be equipped to give instruction leading to the degree of doctor of philosophy in 
at least five departments, according to the standard prescribed in this report, 
and shall have at least one university professional school. The term “ univer- 
sity professional school” shall not be applied to any professional school that 
does not require the two years’ collegiate training for admission. 
VI. Provision for recognition and committee on standards.—1. Provision 
shall be made whereby institutions other than state universities may be freely 
welcomed to adhere to the standards set up by this association. 
2. There shall be a standing committee on standards of five, of which the 
honorable vice-president of this association shall be one. The committee on 
standards further may invite into conference representatives of other educa- 
tional organizations interested in formulating standards. When institutions 
within or without the association seek to adhere to the standards, said commit- 
tee shall have the power to recommend to this association for recognition insti- 
tutions meeting these standards, and may, after report to this association and 
its approval, issue certificates to institutions, departments, and even to indi- 
vidual instructors. 
3. The committee may employ assistance upon the approval of the executive 
committee, to be paid, together with necessary traveling expenses, from a fund
-P-A-G-E-103
  
UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES—HIGHER EDUCATION. 91 
created for the purpose raised by appointment among the members of this 
association, in accordance with the sum expended by each institution for 
salaries. 
The committee or their representative may, when invited, visit an institu- 
tion applying for recognition, the expense of such visitation to be borne by the 
institution concerned. 
4, In making recommendations as to institutions, the committee on standards 
shall give great weight to the character of the curriculum, the efliciency of 
instruction, the scientific spirit, the standard for regular degrees, conservatism 
in granting honorary degrees, and the spirit of the institution. 
Upon motion, the association ordered that “this committee on standards 
shall report further upon standards and classification, and shall cooperate, so 
far as possible, with a similar committee of the Association of American Uni- 
versities.” 
VII. This committee shall further be charged with the duty of correspond- 
ence with institutions and governments at home and abroad to gain proper 
recognition of graduates and students of these recognized institutions, depart- 
ments, and individuals. 
VIII. This association shall publish the standards that have been adopted, 
and from time to time the list of institutions adhering to them. 
Respectfully submitted.

UNIVERSITY NOMENCLATURE. 
An important report, presented by President Van Hise, of Wisconsin 
University, chairman of the committee on university nomenclature, 
was made the special order for the 1909 meeting. The report of the 
committee concluded with the following recommendations: 
1. That the term “college” be restricted to a branch of the university, which 
has a considerable faculty devoted to teaching the special subjects of that 
branch. The following lines of work in the university should be organized as 
colleges : 
(a) Arts and sciences, 
(b) Medicine. 
(c) Law. 
(d) Engineering. 
(e) Agriculture. 
2. That the term “school” be applied to a grouping of courses to a definite 
end, either in a single college or in two or more colleges. The following illus- 
trations of the use recommended may be given: In the college of engineering 
there may be the schools of civil engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical 
engineering, chemical engineering, mining engineering, etc. In the college of 
letters and science there may be schools for the training of teachers, journalism, 
commerce, etc. An illustration of a school located in several colleges would be 
the graduate school. 
3. That the term “department” be restricted to the various subjects taught 
in the university, as, for instance, the department of latin, department of 
mathematics, department of physics, etc.  
-P-A-G-E-104
  92 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
4, That the term “course” be restricted to the subdivisions of a subject, as, 
for instance, course 1 in English. 
5. That the term “division ” be assigned a loose meaning to indicate groupings 
of the different branches of a university organization, or branches which do not 
adapt themselves to classification under the above terms, as, for instance, 
extension division. 
If the above recommendations be adopted your committee further recommend 
that the National Association of State Universities urgently recommend to 
each president that at the earliest possible time the usages approved be adopted 
by the authorities of his institution and introduced into all of its official 
publications. 
The officers of the association for 1908-9 are as follows: President, 
Jacob G. Schurman, Cornell University; vice-president, John W. 
Abercrombie, University of Alabama; vice-president (ex officio), 
Elmer Ellsworth Brown, United States Commissioner of Educa- 
tion; secretary-treasurer, George Emory Fellows, University of 
Maine; executive committee, the above officers and William O. 
Thompson, Ohio State University, and Frank Strong, University of 
Kansas, 
The next meeting will be held in Boston, October 8 and 9, 1909. 
ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES. 
The Tenth Annual Conference of the Association of American 
Universities was held at Cornell University, Ithaca, N. Y., on Jan- 
uary 7 and 8, 1909. Four sessions were held. 
The special committee appointed and instructed to report on the 
standardization of the colleges and to recommend new candidates 
for membership in the association recommended the universities of 
Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, and Nebraska. These institutions were duly 
elected. 
The special committee on nomenclature submitted recommendations 
which were adopted in part and in part referred back to the same 
committee for further consideration. Such of the recommendations 
as were adopted follow: 
That the term “department” be restricted to the various subjects taught in 
the university, as, for instance, the department of Latin, department of mathe- 
matics, department of physics. 
That the term “course” be restricted to the subdivisions of a subject, as, 
for instance, Course I in English. 
That the term “college” be restricted to a part of the university, the stand- 
ard of admission to which is the equivalent of that required by the Carnegie 
Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, and which offers instruction 
leading to a first degree in arts, letters, or sciences. 
That the term “school” be restricted to a part of the university, the stand- 
ard of admission to which is not less than the equivalent of two years’ work 
in the college and which offers instruction of not less than two years in duration 
leading to a technical,or professional degree.
-P-A-G-E-105
  UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES—HIGHER EDUCATION. 93 
The terms “group,” curriculum,” and “ division” were left for 
future definition. 
The association consists now of the following universities: Cali- 
fornia, Catholic, Chicago, Clark, Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Ili- 
nois, Indiana, Iowa, Johns Hopkins, Kansas, Leland Stanford Junior, 
Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Princeton, 
Virginia, Wisconsin, and Yale. The officers for 1909 are Princeton 
University, president; University of Virginia, vice-president; Harv- 
ard University, secretary. The next annual conference will be held at 
the University of Wisconsin. 
HIGHER EDUCATION ASSOCIATION. 
The Higher Education Association was incorporated at Albany, 
N. Y., on May 21, 1909, by Col. Chas. E. Sprague, Dr. Edwin E. 
Slosson, and Mr. Clarence F. Birdseye, of New York City. The 
purposes of the association as stated in the articles of incorporation 
are as follows: 
(a) To improve higher education throughout the United States, and in 
particular the internal and external conditions of the American college, by 
furnishing an agency and funds whereby a careful study can-be made and 
improvements can be brought about in the institutions of higher learning in 
the following ways, among others: 
(1) In the financial department: A fuller and clearer treasurer’s annual 
account; an improved and more complete system of bookkeeping; and through 
the development of an internal cost accounting system, in addition to the present 
method of merely accounting for the cash proceeds of trust and other funds, 
a more economical and intelligent administering of the resources, funds, and 
activities of the colleges. 
(2) In the department of instruction: The improvement of the pedagogical 
training of those proposing to teach in colleges; the conservation of the health 
and other interests of the instructional forces; the increase of their compensa- 
tion; the provision of pensions; the safeguarding and fostering of the interests 
of tutors, preceptors, assistants, and other grades of junior or associate instruc- 
tors; and the improvement of the administrative and other conditions affecting 
the teaching forces, collectively or individually. 
(3) In the department of the student life: The betterment of the college 
community life and of the college home life, whether in the fraternity home, 
the college dormitory, or the local boarding house; the restoration, so far as 
possible, of the individual training of the students, mentally, morally, and 
physically, during their college course and for their widest future usefulness 
as educated citizens. 
(4) In the administrative department: The systematic study and wide adop- 
tion of better and more advanced college administrative methods to secure the 
most efficient use of the college capital in character building and scholarliness ; 
the devising and putting into force of new units of internal valuation of student 
and instructional work; the reduction of college waste and the college waste 
heap in the student, instructional and other departments; the study of the 
college plant and field; the oversight and assistance of graduates; the bringing 
about, so far as is wise and desirable, of standardization and uniformity in 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
  
  94 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
college methods and standards; the making possible of the interchange of stu- 
dents and instructors; the relieving of the instructors from administrative de- 
tails and the putting of these under charge of administrative experts, whose 
duty it shall be to produce in every possible way conditions conducive to more 
efficient work of the instructional forces and to scholarliness. 
(5) In the department of citizenship: The study of the civics and economics 
of the college itself, and of its various planes and departments, and of the 
relations of the student-citizens to the college state, the college community, and 
the college home—all with reference to their future duties as citizens to their 
commonwealth, their community, business or profession, and their homes; the 
founding of chairs for the study of citizenship; the reorganization and fulfill- 
ment of the duties and responsibilities which the colleges themselves owe to the 
state as the capstones of a system of compulsory public-school instruction, which 
has educated, at the public expense, most of the students who enter the colleges; 
and the restoration of the clear conceptions which the earlier institutions had 
of their direct and high obligations to the state as its public servants, to which 
had been intrusted public and private funds and powers. 
(6) And generally to furnish means to determine and fix the true present 
position of the college in our educational system; to minimize the danger of 
injury to the colleges because of the push of the preparatory schools from below 
and of the drain of the professional and graduate schools from above; and to 
inaugurate and foster an active forward movement in the development of the 
colleges and their curriculum. 
(b) To print and publish a magazine or magazines and other periodicals, 
newspapers, pamphlets or books, and to do a general publishing business. 
(c) To organize and carry on a bureau or department for the employment 
of professors, teachers, and others connected with college instruction or admin- 
istration. 
(d) To investigate, through experts or otherwise, the exact conditions pre- 
vailing in the colleges and to formulate plans to improve such conditions; to 
organize, develop, and maintain, within or without the State of New York, 
voluntary and unincorporated associations and assemblages of college alumni 
or others interested in the affairs of the colleges or their students whose direct 
object shall be to advance the cause of higher education and to improve the 
administrative, business, and financial situation in the colleges in order to 
insure that the revision of the place, policy, and ideals of the American college 
and the reorganization of its administration shall be in the hands of its friends 
and well-wishers; to raise and disburse the funds and money necessary or 
desirable to effectuate any of the purposes or objects of the company or the 
advancement of education within the United States. 
The directors for the first year are Col. Charles E. Sprague, Hon. 
George B. Cortelyou, Dr. John H. Finley, Dr. Edwin E. Slosson, 
Dr. Virgil Prettyman, Mr. Clarence F. Birdseye, and Mr. Arthur 
H. Pogson, all of New York City. It is the purpose of the associa- 
tion to publish The American College, a magazine to be devoted to 
the interests of the college at large. 
THE VILAS BEQUEST. 
One of the largest gifts to the cause of higher education in recent 
years is that provided for in the bequest of Col. William F. Vilas, 
formerly United States Senator and member of President Cleveland’s
-P-A-G-E-107
UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES—HIGHER EDUCATION. 95 
Cabinet, who died on August 27, 1908. Under the provisions of his 
will, his estate will be held in trust for the benefit of the University 
of Wisconsin. During her lifetime Mrs. Vilas will receive the net 
income; after her death, with the exception of $30,000 a year for the 
daughter during her lifetime and a few minor charges, the entire 
income goes to the university. One-half of the income will be set 
aside every year and added to the principal until the value of the 
fund shall reach $20,000,000. After that time one-quarter of the 
income will be added in like manner until the sum shall be $30,000,000, 
at which point the accumulation is to cease unless the legislature shall 
otherwise direct. 
Provision is made for the erection of a university theater, to be 
known as “ The Vilas Theater,” at a cost of not less than $250,000. 
This is intended as a meeting place for the student body and will be 
equipped with lecture halls, reading rooms, and other conveniences. 
Numerous scholarships, fellowships, and professorships are provided 
for, and others are to be added from time to time as the increase in 
the income permits. Important among these provisions is that for 
the establishment of ten professorships “ to promote the advancement 
of knowledge rather than to give instruction.” It is provided that 
not more than three hours in one week nor more than one hour in one 
day shall be exacted of these professors for the purpose of teaching or 
lecturing. They shall be given large opportunities to do original 
research work for the advancement, of learning in any branch of hu- 
man knowledge to which the regents may assign them. 
The provisions of the Vilas will were accepted by the legislature 
of Wisconsin in 1909. 
eae FOR ENTRANCE TO MEDICAL DEPARTMENT OF 
WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY. 
On recommendation of the faculty of the medical department of 
Wesiern Reserve University, the trustees have voted that beginning 
with the academic year 1910-11 the requirement for unconditional 
entrance to the medical department shall be graduation from an ap- 
proved college or scientific school granting the bachelor’s degree (or 
equivalent) following the completion of a course of at least: three col- 
legiate years and including inorganic chemistry, physics, biology, 
and Latin. Conditional entrance will be granted upon the comple- 
tion of the work of the junior year in the course of an approved col- 
lege or scientific school enforcing a four-year course (or equivalent 
degree), including the subject requirements enumerated above, con- 
ditioned upon the student obtaining a baccalaureate degree before he 
enters the third year in the medical school. (Science, Feb. 5, 1909.)

TWENTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF CLARK UNIVERSITY. 
In September, 1909, came to its close at Worcester, Mass., the three 
weeks’ celebration of the twentieth anniversary of Clark University. 
No martial pomp or splendor marked the occasion, but its proceedings 
will make the event well known in scientific and educational circles. 
It was a gathering mainly of professors and scientists of America and 
Europe, who delivered addresses and then discussed them in con- 
ference—a method of celebration pronounced unique and admirable. 
Prof. E. H. Moore, of Chicago, lectured on “ Postulational methods 
in mathematics,” followed by Professor Pierpont and Professor Van 
Vleck. In physics, Prof. Albert Abraham Michelson, of Chicago, and 
Prof. Ernest Rutherford, of Manchester, England, represented win- 
ners of Nobel prizes. Prof. Vito Volterra, of Rome, Italy, lectured 
on “ The theory of electric and luminous waves on elasticity, and on 
the mechanics of ‘heredity.’” In psychology, Sigmund Freud, of 
Vienna, and Dr. C. G. Jung, specialist in psychiatry in the University 
of Zurich, were prominent. Dr. Leo Burgerstein, of the University 
of Vienna, a leading authority on school hygiene, gave an interesting 
lecture on coeducation and hygiene, emphasizing the importance of 
differentiating secondary education of boys and girls when taught 
together, and expressed the belief that coeducation is extending in the 
countries of central Europe. There were other lectures by distin- 
guished scholars of America and Europe. Honorary degrees were

UNIVERSITY. 
An act of the New York State legislature of 1909 provides for the’ 
appointment of five trustees of Cornell University by the governor 
of the State. As the law now stands the composition of the board of 
trustees is as follows: The governor, lieutenant-governor, speaker of 
the house of assembly, commissioner of education, president of the 
State Agricultural Society, commissioner of agriculture, librarian of 
the Cornell library, and president of Cornell University, ex officio; the 
eldest lineal male descendant of Ezra Cornell for life; 5 appointed by 
the governor; 15 elected by the board of trustees; 10 by the alumni 
of the University; and 1 each year by the executive committee of the 
New York State Grange. 
THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA SUMMER SCHOOL. 
[From the official report.] 
The last session of the University of Virginia Summer School appeared one 
of the most successful ever assembled in Virginia. There were in attendance 
1,144 students who paid for courses, to say nothing of the numerous visitors. 
Of the students present, 218 were. from 24 States other than Virginia. Of this

UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES—-HIGHER EDUCATION. 97 
large number of students only 180 had no teaching experience. There were 
301 college graduates and 193 high-school graduates in the student body. 
The distinct contribution which the University of Virginia Summer School 
has made during the last three years toward the improvement in the number 
and efficiency of well-trained teachers has been through its courses leading 
toward the professional certificate. This is the only summer school in Vir- 
ginia which the state department of education allows to offer credits toward 
professional certificates. Teachers may take certain advanced courses during 
two or more summer sessions of six weeks each, and if they pass the examina- 
tions after doing creditable daily recitation work, they may procure this 
coveted certificate. There were 294 teachers taking the courses counting 
toward this certificate. 
It is to be noted that the students took what they needed without regard 
to the difficulty of the courses. For example, there were 325 taking mathe- 
matics; 120 taking Latin, some of which was advanced Latin; 118 taking 
agriculture; while the various courses in education contained 352 students. 
English, in which most persons are more or less deficient, numbered 433 stu- 
dents, while drawing, which is a comparatively new subject in Virginia, num- 
bered 445. Manual training, which three years ago had only 12 students, 
enrolled 147. Physics, chemistry, zoology, and botany, which were given with 
great thoroughness by men distinguished in their line, enrolled 119 students. 
Several conferences were held during the session. The first of these was 
the state high-school conference, which has an important work to do in the 
continuous development of the newly established high schools of the State. 
This conference was largely attended by public and private high-school men 
and college professors of the State. The discussions were exceedingly valuable. 
Quite the most interesting conference, and perhaps the most valuable, was 
the rural-life conference. These gatherings were held in the afternoon on 
the lawn and in Cabell Hall at night. Speakers, well known and practical, 
were assembled from various parts of the country to discuss such topics as 
good roads, forestry, school and home sanitation, how to reduce the death 
rate among farm children, improved methods of agriculture, adulteration of 
foods, improved methods of cooking, and similar problems. These addresses 
proved so valuable that it was thought wise to publish them in pamphlet form. 
Two thousand copies were printed and distributed among the teachers and 
other citizens. Five hundred copies were placed at the disposal of the State 
Farmers’ Institute, which met in Cabell Hall immediately after the close of 
the summer school. It is believed that this is one of the ways by which the 
university has rendered some direct service to the State. 
The pleasure of the students was not entirely overlooked. Various plans 
were wrought out, but one of the most interesting was the picturesque his- 
torical pageant commemorating the Fourth of July. Each county and State 
endeavored to represent its most distinguished historical personages. There 
were 1,000 in costume, and the line of march was fully one-fourth of a 
mile long. 
ALUMNI REPRESENTATION ON BOARD OF TRUSTEES. 
On December 7, 1908, the board of trustees of Columbia Univer- 
sity, in the city of New York, took action providing that after Jan- 
uary 1, 1909, six places on the board may be filled upon the nomina- 
tion of the alumni. The nomination shall be made by a nominating 
committee of the alumni, which shall be composed of representatives 
9228—xp 1909—voL 1——7  
-P-A-G-E-110
  98 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
of alumni associations registered with and accepted by the trustees. 
Every association is entitled to cast as many votes by its representa- 
tive or representatives as it has graduate members whose dues for the 
current year have been paid. The resolution adopted by the trustees 
provides that the election of an alumni trustee shall not take effect 
until he shall have filed an irrevocable letter of resignation as alumni 
trustee, to take effect at the end of six years from the date of his 
election. 
EVENING COURSES OF THE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY. 
The Western Reserve University inaugurated in February, 1908, a 
system of evening courses. Classes meet twice weekly for one and 
one-half hour periods. The courses are open to any man or woman 
not regularly registered in any other department of the university, as 
follows: 
1. A graduate of an approved high school, or any person who shall have com- 
pleted such courses of study as are necessary for admission to Adelbert College 
or the College for Women, may secure for work done in these evening courses 
due credit toward a bachelor’s degree. 
2. A person by maturity and preparation rendered capable of pursuing these 
courses with profit may do so without credit toward a degree. 
3. A person holding a baccalaureate degree may receive for these evening 
courses credit toward a master’s degree. 
Since the organization of this system of instruction courses have 
been given in the following departments of study: Economics, 
French, German, history, biology, English, philosophy, political sci- 
ence, mathematics, biblical literature, and sociology. 
  
An act of the legislature of Utah, approved March 22, 1909, pro- 
vides that the government and control of the Agricultural College of 
Utah shall be vested in a board of nine trustees to be appointed by 
the governor for terms of four years. Of the members first ap- 
pointed four shall serve for two years and five for four years. 
Prof. John W. Burgess, dean of the faculty of political science of 
Columbia University, has been appointed also dean of the faculties 
of philosophy and pure science, thus uniting the three nonprofes- 
sional graduate faculties under one administrative head. This ar- 
rangement will result undoubtedly in simplification and economy of 
administration and saving of time to students. 
Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Md., from its organization 
to the present time, has conferred only the bachelor of arts and doctor 
of philosophy degrees for work done outside of the medical depart- 
ment. The board of trustees have now decided to confer the degree 
of master of arts to meet the wishes of those graduate students of 
the university who can not spend the necessary time for completing
-P-A-G-E-111
_STANDARDIZATION OF EDUCATION. 99 
the work for the degree of doctor of philosophy. According to the 
rules adopted, the candidates must have obtained the baccalaureate 
degree from a college of good standing, and must then have followed 
courses of university study under proper guidance for at least two 
years. The academic year immediately preceding the final exami- 
nations must be passed in Johns Hopkins University, unless special 
permission to the contrary is granted for some extraordinary reason. 
The trustees of Lawrence University, Appleton, Wis., decided on 
December 2, 1908, to change the name of the institution to Lawrence 
College, to drop at the close of the scholastic year 1908-9 the pre- 
paratory department and the school of commerce, and to concentrate 
their efforts upon the college of liberal arts. 
The charter of Swarthmore College, Swarthmore, Pa., has been 
amended by removing the requirement that the officers and members 
of the board of managers should be members of the religious Society 
of Friends. (Swarthmore Bulletin, Vol. VI, No. 3.) 
The University of Idaho will open a law school in September, 
1909. The course of study will extend through three years. 
The University of Michigan has established the degree of doctor 
of law for students in the law department who have already received 
the bachelor of arts degree. (Michigan Alumnus, March, 1909, 
p. 224.) 
In order to assist the cities of Wisconsin in framing their ordinances 
by giving them the advantage of information regarding the best 
municipal legislation throughout the world, the extension division 
of the University of Wisconsin has just established a new department 
to be known as the “bureau of municipal reference.” This new 
department will undertake to do for the city councils of the State 
what the legislative reference department at the capitol has been 
doing for the state legislature.

veterinary colleges whose graduates may be deemed qualified for the 
positions they are expected to fill in the department, the Secretary 
of Agriculture appointed a committee on veterinary education com- 
posed of Dr. Richard P. Lyman, secretary of the American Veteri- 
nary Medical Association; Dr. Joseph Hughes, president of the 
Chicago Veterinary College; Dr. Tait Butler, secretary of the Asso- 
ciation of Veterinary Faculties and Examining Boards of North 
America; Dr. Paul Fischer, state veterinarian of Ohio, and Dr. A. M. 
Farrington, Assistant Chief of the Bureau of Animal Industry, to 
visit the veterinary colleges throughout the United States in order 
to gain definite information regarding their equipment and facilities 
for teaching, and also to indicate to the department the necessary 
matriculation examination and course of instruction to qualify grad- 
uates for admission to the civil-service examination. The committee 
submitted a report, which was approved by the Secretary of Agri- 
culture on June 8, 1908. On August 9, 1909, the following regula- 
tions, based on the committee’s report, were issued by the Bureau of 
Animal Industry of the Department of Agriculture (Circular 150) :

V. AID TO STUDENTS. 
INDUSTRIAL FELLOWSHIPS—UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS. 
The University of Kansas has inaugurated a system of industrial 
fellowships for the promotion of learning along scientific industrial 
lines. The work is under the direction of Robert Kennedy Duncan, 
professor of industrial chemistry, and is supported financially by 
private donors, usually some manufacturing establishment interested 
in the development of a particular process. An agreement is entered 
into by the university, the donor, and the fellow, by which the fellow 
is to spend two years in investigation of the subject chosen and is to 
receive, in addition to the amount of the fellowship, a part of the 
profits or proceeds derived as a result of his research. 
The first ten fellowships, as described by Professor Duncan, were 
as follows: 
1, An investigation into the chemistry of laundering, having for its object 
an improvement which will save in some measure laundered fabrics. It yields 
$500 a year, together with 10 per cent of the net profits. 
2, A search for a new diastase. The present source of the best diastase is 
expensive. The investigation has as a matter of fact developed into an attempt 
to make a new fodder upon scientific principles. It yields $500 a year and, 
under the original agreement, 10 per cent of the gross proceeds for three years. 
3. An attempt to utilize the constituents of waste buttermilk, which, at pres- 
ent, in butter factories goes down the drains. These constituents, which it is 
desirable to conserve, are primarily casein, and secondarily, lactic acid and 
sugar of milk. The fellowship yields $500 a year and 10 per cent of the net 
profits. 
4. An investigation into the chemistry of baking. This investigation was 
established by the National Association of Master Bakers with the object not 
only of improving the chemistry of bread, but, as well, of providing for the 
association a trained expert upon whom they could afterwards rely. It yields 
$500 a year, together with a lump sum to be settled by arbitration, if necessary. 
5, An investigation into the constituents of crude petroleum. The fellowship 
yields $1,000 a year and 10 per cent of the net profits. 
6. An attempt to improve the enamel upon the enamel-lined steel tanks used 
in all kinds of chemical operations on a large scale. This fellowship was estab- 
lished by the largest manufacturer of these tanks in the world. It yields $1,300 
a year, together with an additional consideration to be decided upon, for the 
service rendered, by the chancellor of the university or one whom he may 
appoint. 
7. An investigation into the relation between the optical properties of glass 
and its chemical constitution. This fellowship yields $1,500 a year and 10 
per cent of the net profits. 
8. The discovery of new utilities for Portland cement and of improvements 
in its manufacture. This fellowship yields $1,500 a year and a large additional 
consideration dependent upon success. 
9, An investigation into certain glands of deep-sea mammals, It yields $1,500 
a year and an additional consideration to be decided upon by arbitration. This 
fellowship is to be a benefaction.

PRINCETON BUREAU OF STUDENT SELF-HELP AND COOPERATIVE 
STORE. 
The bureau of student self-help at Princeton University, which 
is conducted under the auspices of the college Young Men’s Christian 
Association, is rendering excellent service in the interest of under- 
graduates who are working their way through college. This bureau 
keeps a classified list of opportunities for employment, and a list 
of students wishing to work. Through these lists the applicant 
for work is assigned to the job he is capable of handling, and the 
bureau guarantees that the work will be done satisfactorily. Expert 
service in stenography and typewriting is one of its specialties, and 
in addition men are furnished for all sorts of general work, such as 
tending furnaces, mowing lawns, raking leaves, addressing envelopes, 
caring for tennis courts, distributing advertisements, etc. No charge 
is made -by the bureau, its object being purely philanthropic. In 
every class there are several men who pay all their college expenses 
by their own exertions, and about one-third of all the students earn 
the money to pay part of their expenses. 
Another student organization which reduces expenses for the un- 
dergraduates is the university store, the Princeton codp. This in- 
stitution, which since its establishment a few years ago has prospered 
until now it occupies several rooms in West College, furnishes sup- 
plies to students at reduced rates, on the payment of a nominal mem- 
bership fee to meet its expenses. A graduate manager is in charge, 
and members of the faculty and alumni have a general oversight of 
the store. (Boston Transcript, Nov. 14, 1908.) 
  
Bryn Mawr College has established ten graduate scholarships, five 
open to English, Irish, or Scotch, and five to German women students, 
who have attained a standard equivalent to that of the bachelor’s 
degree. The scholarship covers the fees for board, residence, and 
tuition at Bryn Mawr College for one academic year, and as these 
fees for graduate students amount to $405 this is equivalent to a 
scholarship of £81 or of 1,620 marks. (Science, Feb. 5, 1909.) 
Two fellowships of an annual value of $400 each, and two graduate 
scholarships of $225 each were established in the College of Agricul- 
ture of the University of Wisconsin at the recent meeting of the 
regents. These fellowships and scholarships are open to graduates 
of colleges of recognized standing or other students whose education 
is equivalent to that represented by a college degree. Both men and 
women are eligible. :

The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts announces the award 
by its board of directors of the academy’s gold medal of honor, the 
highest award which it is in the power of the institution to bestow 
upon an artist, to Thomas P. Anshutz. This medal is awarded in the 
discretion of the board of directors of the academy in recognition of 
high achievement, or for eminent services in the cause of art or to the 
academy. 
The committee in charge of the Sarah Berliner research fellow- 
ship for women will offer every two years a fellowship of the value 
of $1,200, available for study and research in physics, chemistry, 
or biology, in either America or Europe. Applicants must hold 
degrees of doctor of philosophy or be similarly equipped for the 
work. Chairman of committee, Mrs. Christine Lad Franklin, Johns 
Hopkins University. : 
VI. CHANGES IN PERSONNEL OF OFFICIALS. 
President J. B. Angell, of the University of Michigan, resigned 
February 17, 1909, to take effect at the close of the university year; 
Harry B. Hutchins, dean of the law school of the university, has 
been chosen acting president for one year. 
The board of regents passed a resolution expressing their desire 
to record at that time and in some measure their appreciation of the 
services of President Angell to the institution of which he had so long 
been the head, and whose “ advance in effectiveness of educational 
work and in all that goes to make a university great,” had been no 
less prominently marked than the growth in its student attendance 
(from about 1,200 to more than 5,000). The resolution closes as 
follows: 
Proud as he may justly be of the homage which the world justly yields him 
as educator, diplomat, and publicist, he has even greater cause for pride in the 
grateful affection of the people of this State, whom he has served so long and 
so abundantly, and in the love of the army of students, whose lives he has 
directly enriched and to whom he will always stand for all that is highest and 
best in scholarly attainments, in private character, and in public and private 
citizenship. : 
President Charles W. Eliot, of Harvard University, on October 10, 
1908, tendered to the corporation his resignation, to take effect not 
later than May 19, 1909, on which date he would complete forty 
years of service as president. The resignation was regretfully ac- 
cepted by the corporation on October 26, 1908, and by the overseers 
on November 4, 1908, to take effect May 19, 1909. On January 13, 
1909, the corporation elected Abbott Lawrence Lowell, LL. D., pro-

fessor of the science of government, as president of the university. 
On June 28 Doctor Eliot was elected by the corporation president 
emeritus of the institution. This is stated to be the first honor of the 
kind in the history of the university, and one of the few such compli- 
mentary actions taken by higher institutions in this country. 
The new president, Doctor Lowell, is a Harvard man, having been 
graduated with the class of 1877, and having finished his training at 
the Harvard Law School. From 1880 until 1897 he was engaged in 
the active practice of law. During this period he found time to make 
extended studies in comparative government, the result of which was 
his work on governments and parties in continental Europe, pub- 
lished in 1897. From 1897 to 1899 he held the position of lecturer 
on government at Harvard. In 1900 the (Dorman B.) Eaton pro- 
fessorship of the science of government was founded at Harvard, and 
Doctor Lowell occupied this chair until the time of his election as 
president of the university. 
Dr. Richard Cockburn Maclaurin was inaugurated president of 
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology June 7, 1909. Dr. Ernest 
Fox Nichols has been elected to succeed Doctor Tucker as president 
at Dartmouth, and will enter upon his duties at the beginning of the 
fall term, 1909. It is noteworthy that both men were called from the 
department of physics in Columbia University, and both have 
attained considerable distinction in abstract, science. 
Mrs. Ella Flagg Young, since 1905 principal of the Chicago Nor- 
mal School, was chosen in July, 1909, to be superintendent of the Chi- 
cago public schools. She will be the first woman to occupy this posi- 
tion, having been elected in competition with a number of candidates 
who had been urged for the position since the resignation of Superin- 
tendent Edwin G. Cooley. Mrs. Young has been engaged in teaching 
since 1862. She was district superintendent of schools for Chicago 
from 1887 to 1899 and professor of education at the University of 
Chicago from 1899 to 1905. The Chicago school board has created a 
new position in the schools, that of assistant to the superintendent. 
Jobn D. Shoop, supervisor of vacation schools, was chosen to fill it. 
Other changes are the following: 
Samuel Avery was elected chancellor of the University of Ne- 
braska to succeed E. B. Andrews, whose resignation took effect 
January 1, 1909. Dr. Francis Brown was inaugurated as president 
of Union Theological Seminary, New York City, November 17, 1908. 
Rev. Marion Leroy Burton, Ph. D., has been elected president of 
Smith College, Northampton, Mass., in place of Rev. L. Clark Seelye, 
resigned. Donald J. Cowling, of Baker University, Baldwin, Kans., 
has been elected president of Carleton College, Northfield, Minn. 
Thomas F. Crane, dean of the faculty of Cornell University, retired 
at the end of the year 1908 on a Carnegie pension. Rey. William

University, died January 1, 1909. Dr. R. C. Hughes, president of 
Ripon College, has resigned. Miss Agnes Irwin, dean of Radcliffe 
College since 1894, has resigned to take effect September 1, 1909.

John H. Wright, professor of Greek at Harvard and dean of the 
graduate school, died in November, 1908. 
VII. PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
  
REPORT OF THE SUPERVISOR OF ELEMENTARY RURAL SCHOOLS 
IN VIRGINIA. 
A work has been inaugurated by the trustees of the Peabody fund 
among the elementary rural schools of Virginia, which is described in 
the following extracts from the first report made by Mr. James S.
-P-A-G-E-123
  PUBLIC SCHOOLS. SEY 
Thomas, supervisor of rural schools of Virginia, to Mr. Wickliffe 
Rose, general agent of the fund, and dated June 30, 1909. Mr. Rose, 
in forwarding a copy of this report to the bureau, states that it is 
necessarily tentative. 
From the Report of the Supervisor. 
* * * Jn accordance with the understanding reached as to the beginnings 
of this work, it was deemed wise to make choice of a few typical counties and 
concentrate on them in shaping a definite ideal or plan for the guidance of 
local school authorities. Two counties have been selected for special work and 
eleven others for general improvement. In selecting these counties care was 
taken, not so much to find counties with somewhat ample funds, but to strike 
an average of conditions, regardless of the present state of school finances. 
The first thing deemed necessary in all of these counties was to take ad- 
vantage of the new law passed by the last general assembly to have the salary of 
the office of division (county) superintendent supplemented in order that good 
men might be selected for these offices. Twelve of the thirteen counties 
responded and raised the superintendent’s salary to a point that would justify 
the employment of a good man for his entire time. The thirteenth was already 
paying an adequate salary. It is now possible to undertake work with the 
cooperation of competent superintendents in these counties, where previously, 
in some instances at least, this would not have been possible. In addition to 
this supplement to the superintendents’ salaries in these counties, the boards 
of supervisors, which is our taxing body, increased the school levy in sums rang- 
ing from 5 to 20 cents on the hundred dollars on assessed values. This 
increase augmented the school funds in amounts ranging from a minimum of 
$1,300 to a maximum of $5,000 per year in each county, the total aggregate 
being $36,000 increase. In addition to this, $22,250 was raised by private sub- 
scription for the purpose of helping to build new and modern schoolhouses and 
to help carry on our special work. 
Six of these counties have been organized for some industrial work. In 
inaugurating this movement, we have used every agency found in the county 
willing to help. Briefly, the plan is as follows: 
Prizes are offered the children of the schools for certain products of the 
home and farm. These must be produced by the boys and girls. The prize 
lists are made up to suit the needs of each individual county. Pamphlets are 
prepared by experts setting forth in a thoroughly practical way just how the 
work is to be done to get the best results. ‘These are distributed to the schools 
before the sessions close. The teachers go over them with the children two or 
three times each week explaining how to use them. This forms a basis for 
elementary agriculture and domestic science. The teachers also advise with 
the boys and girls about the classes of contests they are to enter. Each child 
then fills out an entry blank and these are forwarded to the office of the 
division superintendent. The work is to be done during the summer vacation 
and does not in any way interfere with the regular school work. This has 
made the movement many friends among a certain class of individuals who 
insist upon a close adherence to the “three R’s.” 
In October, just before the session begins, a two days’ “ educational fair” will 
be held at the county seat. Prizes will be awarded, spelling bees conducted, 
oratorical contests held, and educational addresses delivered. We hope to make 
these the biggest days of the year. * * * 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
    112 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
Reports to date show 2,860 boys and girls entered in the six counties. The 
number will be largely increased before the entry lists close. The prizes range 
from $1 to $65 and the amounts given in each county from $160 in Augusta to 
$450 in Campbell. All prize money is supplied locally. Another year will see 
50 counties fully organized for this work. The State Federation of Women’s 
Clubs is helping us, and we are in close touch with the Department of Agri- 
culture in Washington. 
Through the teachers’ association of one of the counties some special work 
has been undertaken. Friday afternoon is set aside as a sort of “ party lunch 
hour.” Girls are asked to bring various things to eat, prepared by themselves. 
The boys are requested to make report on the “meat bill at home this week” 
or the “ flour account,” stating to the “ Home Club” such information as they 
may have obtained as to where the meat was produced or from what source 
the flour was derived. AIl of the home matters will be studied in this way. 
We hope by this means to emphasize such facts as, for example, that an in- 
competent farmer raises one thing in Virginia and buys his pork from Iowa 
and his corn in Illinois; while an intelligent farmer in Virginia raises all that 
he eats or uses about the farm, and more besides. The people are responding 
to this rational treatment of our problem, and my future reports will reveal 
certain facts of progress which I am sure will be of interest to you. 
The two counties which have been decided upon for special work are Halifax 
and Sussex. In these counties I am making a close study of the educational, 
economic, and social conditions. A map is just being completed which will set 
forth the farm and home conditions in Halifax County. Everything is recorded 
that has to do with the improvement, or its reverse, in rural life. Conditions 
of homes, schools, churches, farms, outhouses, sanitation, stock, crops—in short, 
a complete census of everything pertaining to the life of the people * * * 
When this map of Halifax County is completed, a similar map of Sussex 
County will be made. In Sussex County also a good deal of work has been 
done, but not a sufficient amount upon which to base a map and statistical 
report. * * * 
It is peculiarly fitting that the work now being done by myself, through the 
generosity of the Peabody board, should begin just at a time when there will 
be in the various divisions of the State an amount of expert supervision of 
schools heretofore impossible. This means cooperation by the local superin- 
tendents, who are, indeed, the key to the situation in the work now being under- 
taken for the scientific development of our rural schools. 
SCHOOL SUPERVISION. 
  
Georgia.—A. bill was passed in 1909 by the Georgia legislature 
providing for the popular election of county school commissioners. 
The examination now required by law to be taken for this office is 
to be held at least ninety days before the day of election, and all 
candidates must stand said examination, and those who fail to make 
85 per cent shall, by the board of education, be declared ineligible 
to hold the office of county school commissioner. 
Missouri.—The legislature of Missouri, at the session held in 1909, 
passed a law creating the office of county superintendent of public 
schools in each and every county of the State, who shall be elected 
every four years by the qualified voters of the county. The law pre- 
scribes that he shall be at least 24 years old, a citizen of the county, 
 
-P-A-G-E-125
  
  PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 113 
shall have taught or supervised schools as his chief work during at 
least two of the four years next preceding his. election, or shall have 
spent the two years next preceding his election as a regular student 
in a normal school, college, or university, and shall at the time of his 
election hold a diploma from one of the state normal schools or teach- 
ers’ college of the State University, or shall hold a life state certifi- 
cate authorizing him to teach in the public schools of Missouri, 
granted by the state superintendent of public schools as the result of 
an examination which shall include the subjects of school supervision 
and teaching in the rural schools, or shall hold a first-grade county 
certificate. The salary of the county superintendent ranges from 
$700 in counties having less than 12,000 population to $1,500 in coun- 
ties having 50,000 population or more. .The State appropriates to 
each county the sum of $400 toward the salary of the superintendent. 
Ohio.—An act of the legislature of Ohio, which became a law on 
March 25, 1909, provides for the appointment by the state commis- 
sioner of common schools of two inspectors, at an annual salary of 
$2,000 each, to aid in the recognition and classification of high schools. 
The inspectors are appointed for terms of two years, one being 
appointed annually. 
EDUCATIONAL CAMPAIGN IN KENTUCKY. 
Hon. J. G. Crabbe, state superintendent of public instruction of 
Kentucky, opened a whirlwind campaign for better education in that 
State on November 28, 1908. The campaign covered a period of 
‘nine days and was carried on by 29 speakers, who delivered nearly 300 
public addresses. The entire State was covered, and nearly 60,000 
people heard the addresses. Much good to education is expected to 
result from the campaign, which is described in Bulletin No. 10 of 
the Kentucky department of education. ; 
(See also account of the work of the conference for education in 
Texas, p. 62.) 
PUBLIC-SCHOOL FRATERNITIES. 
By an act approved March 16, 1909, the legislature of California 
forbids the formation and existence of secret fraternities, sororities, 
or clubs in the public elementary and-secondary schools in California, 
and requires boards of education and boards of school trustees to 
enforce the provisions of the act by suspending, or, if necessary, 
expelling a pupil who refuses or neglects to obey any rules or regula- 
tions that may be made in pursuance of the provisions of the act. 
The legislature of the State of Oregon, by an act (Session Laws, 
1909, p. 318), declares unlawful secret societies of every kind and 
character, including fraternities and sororities, which may now or 
9228—xp 1909—voL, 1——8

  114 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
hereafter exist among the pupils of any of the public schools of the 
State, including high schools, either local or county. It authorizes 
each school board to suspend or expel from school all pupils who 
engage in the organization or maintenance of such societies. 
An act of the legislature of Vermont, approved January 7, 1909, 
prohibits the pupils attending any public school in the State which 
is wholly or partly maintained by public funds from joining or from 
soliciting any other pupil of said school to join any secret fraternity, 
club, or society, except such societies or associations as are sanctioned 
by the school authorities. The school authorities are empowered to 
suspend or dismiss any pupils violating the provisions of the act. 
VIL TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
NORTH CENTRAL COUNCIL OF STATE NORMAL SCHOOL 
PRESIDENTS. 
The eighth annual meeting of the North Central Council of State 
Normal School Presidents was held at Chicago March 24-25, 1909. 
Each of the three sessions of the council was devoted to a particular 
topic, which was open for general discussion. The discussion of the 
topic “ The present and future place of the normal school in American 
education ” is stated by President Guy E. Maxwell to have shown— 
that in most States of this section of the country the normal schools are press: 
ing upon the legislature and the people the necessity, or at least the desirability, 
of developing the present normal schools into what was nominated the “ com- 
plete normal school;” that is, a school preparing for all grades of teaching in 
public schools. This policy contemplates the enlargement of present courses of 
study to include four years of college work and the increase of the practice 
department so as to include the high-school grades. 
Another topic considered was “ The academic content of the course 
of study, answering the question, ‘To what extent is the inefficiency 
of the public schools due to the lack of scholarship and a disciplined 
mind on the part of the public-school teacher?’ ” 
Debate upon this question took the direction of “raising the 
academic standards of the schools with somewhat less emphasis upon 
so-called professional subjects.” 
An important paper was presented by President William W. 
Parsons, of the Indiana State Normal School, upon “ the kinds and 
relative amounts of work in a standard normal school course of 
study, with a statement of entrance requirements, relative amounts 
of (1) academic, (2) theoretical or professional, and (8) practice 
work, assuming that the normal schools are required to meet three 
 
-P-A-G-E-127

demands—better trained teachers for (1) rural schools, (2) elemen- 
tary graded schools, (3) high schools.” 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS FOR THE RURAL SCHOOLS OF 
WASHINGTON. 
The State Normal School at Cheney, Wash., has organized a de- 
partment for the training of rural school teachers. The course of 
study will extend through two years for graduates of the eighth 
grade and through one year for those who have completed the ninth 
and tenth grades. In addition to advanced work in mathematics, 
English, history, science, and language, it will embrace a thorough 
review of all the common branches, work in agriculture, nature study, 
and that special professional training that will fit students for rural 
school teaching. The head of the new department will be Mr. N. D. 
Showalter, now county superintendent of Whitman County. (North- 
western Journal of Education, September, 1908.) 
  
The general education board established a professorship of second- 
ary education in the University of Arkansas, November, 1908. 
An act of 1909 of the legislature of Kansas appropriates $50,000 
per annum for two years for the maintenance of normal training 
courses in public high schools. Each school designated by the state 
board of education is to receive $500 per annum to be expended only 
in the payment of salaries. The amount that may be granted to 
high schools in any one county is limited to $1,000. In case more 
than two schools are designated in any county, the state aid of $1,000 
will be equally divided among said schools. 
An act of the legislature of Minnesota approved March 26, 1909, 
provides that the state normal schools shall hold a summer session of 
twelve weeks each under the direction of the state normal board, 
unless said board shall direct that a shorter session be held at any 
of said schools. 
State Supt. E. C. Bishop, of Nebraska, has appointed Prof. E. L. 
Rouse of the state normal school at Peru, and Supt. E. J. Bodwell, of 
Beatrice, as directors of normal training in the high schools of 
Nebraska. These men give supervisory attention to the new work and 
receive actual traveling expenses only. 
The board of estimate of New York City has appropriated $500,000 
as the first installment of the $2,000,000 needed to rebuild the normal 
college. At a meeting of the student body held on Monday night, 
April 19, 1909, President George S. Davis announced that the work 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
  116 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
of rebuilding would begin as soon as plans could be made. When 
finally completed, the college will be a well-equipped school for its 
purpose. The new chapel will stand in the center, and other build- 
ings will be placed around it on open courts. 
The State of North Dakota has granted the sum of $60,000 for a 
teachers’ college building. : 
The legislature of Oregon during its session in 1909 abolished the 
Central Oregon State Normal School, at Drain, and authorized the 
board of regents to convey the real property belonging to said school 
to the public-school district in which the same lies, free of charge for 
educational purposes. No appropriations were made for the other 
state normal schools. 
An act of the legislature of Tennessee approved April 27, 1909, pro- 
vides for the establishment and maintenance in each grand division of 
the State of one normal school for the education and professional 
training of white teachers; also, the establishment and maintenance 
of one agricultural and industrial normal school for the industrial 
education of negroes and for preparing negro teachers for the com- 
mon schools. The management and control of these normal schools 
is vested in the state board of education. 
By an act approved November 20, 1908, the legislature of Vermont 
provided an appropriation of $6,000 annually for the establishment 
and maintenance at Middlebury College of a department of pedagogy 
for the education and training of high-school teachers. 
An act of the legislature of Virginia approved March 14, 1908, pro- 
vides for the establishment of state normal and industrial schools for 
women at Harrisonburg and Fredericksburg and appropriates $75,000 
for the purpose. 
Closer cooperation between the. University of Wisconsin and the 
normal schools of the State in the training of high-school teachers is 
the aim of the plan just adopted by the university after a conference 
with representatives of the normals. Hereafter graduates of the 
German and Latin courses in any of the normal schools will be admit- 
ted to the university with two years’ credit, so that they can complete 
their work for the degree of bachelor of arts in two years more, mak- 
ing a four-year course. The adoption of this plan by the normal- 
school regents will make possible the full utilization of the existing 
institutions of the State for better academic and professional prepa- 
ration of teachers. (University Bulletin, Aug. 16, 1909.)

    TEACHERS’ TENURE, SALARIES, PENSIONS, ETO. 117 
IX. TEACHERS’ TENURE, SALARIES, PENSIONS, ETC. 
TENURE OF SERVICE IN NEW JERSEY. 
An act of the legislature of New Jersey approved April 21, 1909, 
provides that— 
The service of all teachers, principals, supervising principals of the public 
schools in any school district of this State shall be during good behavior and 
efficiency, after the expiration of a period of employment of three consecutive 
years in that district, unless a shorter period is fixed by the employing board: 
Provided, That the time any teacher, principal, or supervising principal has 
taught in the district in which he or she is employed at the time this act shall 
go into effect, shall be counted in determining such period of employment. No 
principal or teacher shall be dismissed or subjected to reduction of salary in 
said school district except for inefficiency, incapacity, conduct unbecoming a 
teacher, or other just cause, and after a written charge of the cause or causes 
has been preferred against him or her, signed by the person or persons making 
the same, and filed with the secretary or clerk of the board of education having 
charge of the school in which the service is being rendered, and after the charge 
shall have been examined into and found true in fact by said board of education, 
upon reasonable notice to the person charged, who may be represented by counsel 
at the hearing. Charges may be filed by any person whether a member of said 
school board or not. 
The act reserves to any school board the right— 
to reduce the number of principals or teachers employed in any school district 
when such reduction shall be due to a natural diminution of the number of 
pupils in said school district: And provided further, That the service of any 
principal or teacher may be terminated without charge or trial who is not a 
holder of a proper teacher’s certificate in full force and effect. 
The provisions of the act are not limited to any particular section 
or sections of the State, but apply to all the teachers, principals, and 
supervising principals of the public schools in the State of New 
Jersey. They do not, however, apply to superintendents. 
TEACHERS’ RETIREMENT FUNDS. 
The annual report of 1908 contains the provisions for teachers’ 
pensions made by law in Massachusetts and Virginia. During the 
year 1909 several acts were passed in other States dealing with 
annuities or establishing pension funds. 
California.—The legislature amended the pension-fund act of 1905 
by defining the sources of the fund’s income, as follows: (1) Twelve 
dollars a year from each member regardless of amount of salary; 
(2) gifts and bequests; (3) all portions of salary forfeited on 
account of absence from duty.

  118 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
Maryland.—The legislature recently passed a teachers’ retirement 
act for the city of Baltimore, which authorizes the establishment of a 
separate pension fund independent of the state fund. 
Minnesota.—An act was passed in April, 1909, granting to teachers 
of cities of 50,000 inhabitants and over the right to establish teachers’ 
retirement-fund associations; which must be incorporated. It pro- 
vides that the city boards of education approve of the plan of the 
associations. Only contributors to the fund are entitled to its bene- 
fits, but a portion of the fund may be raised by taxation, as part of 
the local school taxes, not exceeding one-tenth of a mill of the tax- 
able property of the city. The term “teachers” embraces all em- 
ployees of the board, except janitors. The amount of the annual 
contribution of the teachers to the fund is not mentioned, but is left 
to the board administering the fund, which can be established only 
if a majority of the teachers of the city have signified their willing- 
ness to join the association. 
Nebraska—An act of 1909 of the legislature of Nebraska provides 
that in every school district in a city of the metropolitan class there 
shall be created a public-school teachers’ retirement fund, which shall 
be under the control of the board of education of such school district. 
The fund is to be created and maintained (1) by an assessment of not 
less than 1 nor more than 1} per cent of every installment of salary 
paid to a teacher regularly employed; (2) by setting aside from the 
general fund of the school district of an amount which shall be not 
less than one and one-half times the amount of salary assessments, and 
not less than the amount necessary to meet the payments provided for; 
(8) by the receipt by gift or otherwise of any real, personal, or mixed 
property, or any interest therein. The law provides that any teacher 
who has been credited under the rules and regulations of the board 
of education with an aggregate of thirty-five years of teaching ex- 
perience may be retired, and any teacher who has been so credited 
with an aggregate of forty years of teaching experience shall be 
retired for no other cause than length of service, and shall receive 
from the retirement fund $500 per annum so long as such teacher may 
live, provided that at least twenty years of such teaching experience 
shall have been in the public schools of such school district. Any 
teacher who has been credited with an aggregate of twenty-five or 
more years of teaching experience may be retired on account of dis- 
ability or incapacity, physical or otherwise, and shall receive from 
the retirement fund, during the period of retirement, monthly install- 
ments, the annual aggregate of which shall be such percentage of the 
sum of $500 as the number of years of accredited teaching experi- 
ence of the beneficiary shall bear to the term of thirty-five years, pro- 
vided that at least twenty years of such accredited teaching experi- 
ence shall have been in the public schools of such school district.

TEACHERS’ TENURE, SALARIES, PENSIONS, ETC. 19 
Teachers under a tenure of permanent employment at the time of 
the approval of the act may, with the approval of the board of educa- 
tion, be exempt from its provisions. 
Pennsylwania.—A retirement fund for teachers has been established 
in Harrisburg, which is administered by a separate board. The sa- 
lient features of the scheme are: (1) All the teachers in service at the 
time of the establishment of the fund get full annuity when retired. 
(2) Teachers now in service are exempt from minimum age and 
minimum length of service requirement. (8) Full annuity is half 
salary—that is, not less than.$300, and not more than $800. (4) 
All teachers contribute 2 per cent of their salaries during the first ten 
years of service; 8 per cent thereafter. (5) The city school board 
contributes annually an amount equal to the amount contributed by 
the teachers. (6) Teachers hereafter coming into the service of the 
city may retire after thirty years of service, twenty years of which 
must be in Harrisburg, and after they become 60 years of age. (7) 
Partial annuities for those hereafter coming into service are propor- 
tionate to the time taught in Harrisburg. (8) The maximum con- 
tribution per annum is $50, no matter what the salary may be.. The 
most striking feature of the scheme is, that if any present teacher 
should become incapacitated in any way, she may retire, regardless of 
age or length of service, on full annuity. (Journal of Education, 
Boston.) 
Rhode Island.—The legislature by an act of April 29, 1909, amended 
the pension law of 1907 by extending its provisions to teachers who 
had retired before the law was passed. The amended law omits the 
age requirement of 60 years. 
Virginia.—Concerning the law in Virginia, the following official 
explanation is made: ; 
Every teacher who is pensioned will receive one-half “of the annual salary 
earned by such person at the time he or she was placed on such list,” to be 
paid in quarterly installments, provided that no teacher shall receive more 
than $400 annually and no principal more than $500. 
The law provides: 
_ “1, That whenever any person, not including superintendents, has taught in 
the public schools of this State an aggregate of twenty years, if said person has 
maintained a good record and by reason of physical or mental infirmity or old 
age is incapable of rendering efficient service as a teacher, or if said person has 
taught for twenty-five years in this State, and desires to be retired, as herein 
provided, he or she may make application to the state board of education to be 
retired and pensioned as hereinafter provided. If the state board of education 
shall find the facts as above stated it shall place the name of the said person 
upon a list to be known as the ‘retired teachers’ list,’ and the said board may, 
of its own motion, place any teacher on said list who has served for twenty 
years if said board shall deem it best for the good of the school system to take 
such action. A careful record shall be kept by the said board of the names of 
the teachers retired and pensioned under the provisions of this act, and every 
person so placed upon said list shall receive a pension as hereinafter provided.
-P-A-G-E-132
    
120 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
“2, The fund; whence derived: In order to provide a fund to pension said 
retired teachers all contracts with teachers shall provide that the chairman and 
clerk of the school board or other officers whose duty it is to pay public school 
teachers shall deduct monthly from the salary of each teacher in the State a sum 
equal to 1 per cent of his or her salary. Each teacher shall be furnished a 
statement showing the amount so deducted. The sum so deducted shall be 
promptly remitted by the officers deducting the same through the office of the 
second auditor of Virginia to the state board of education, which shall imme- 
diately deposit the same with the state treasurer. All amounts so received 
shall be placed by the state treasurer to the credit of a fund to be called ‘ the 
retired teachers’ fund,’ and an accurate account shall be kept of all funds so 
received.” (Virginia Journal of Education.) 
Wisconsin.—The Milwaukee authorities determined that in place of 
a pension fund partly provided for by taxation, the teachers shall help 
themselves by paying, or having withheld from their salaries, $2 a 
month for twenty-five years. No teacher is to receive an annuity 
unless he or she has paid into the fund $500, and has taught twenty- 
five years. 
District of Columbia—The special committee of the board of 
education on “ teachers’ retirement” has prepared a bill to be pre- 
sented to Congress providing for the creation of a retirement fund 
for the teachers of the District of Columbia. Section 1 of the bill 
provides for the creation of the fund from the following sources: 
(1) Unused balances at the close of the fiscal year on account of sal- 
aries of teachers and officers. (2) Donations, legacies, gifts, bequests, 
etc. (3) A sum equal to 14 per cent of annual appropriation for 
salaries of teachers and officers to be placed in the retirement fund by 
the Treasurer of the United States. (4) A certain per cent deducted 
from the teachers’ salaries: (a) One per cent of all salaries of the 
teaching and supervising force who have taught less than ten years; 
(b) 14 per cent of the salaries of all who have taught more than ten 
years and less than twenty years; (c) 2 per cent of the salaries of 
all who have taught more than twenty years. Time is to be calculated 
on June 30, and salaries to be calculated in even hundreds of dollars. 
Not more than $30 is to be deducted from the salary of a principal 
or teacher in any one year and not more than $40 from the salary of 
any supervising official. 
Section 2 provides for a board of retirement, whose members shall 
be the president of the board of education and one member designated 
by him; the superintendent of schools; the colored assistant superin- 
tendent; the director of intermediate instruction; and six teachers, 
two representing the high schools and special subjects, two repre- 
senting intermediate grades, and two representing primary grades. 
The six teachers are to be elected by the teachers whom they represent. 
Section 3 provides that, on recommendation of the retirement board, 
the board of education shall have power, by a two-thirds vote, to retire 
any teacher or officer mentally or physically unfit for service who has
-P-A-G-E-133
TEACHERS’ TENURE, SALARIES, PENSIONS, ETC. 121 
taught twenty years, ten years in the District of Columbia. It may 
retire any member of the teaching corps who has attained the age of 
65 and has taught thirty years, ten years in the District of Columbia. 
The board of education is also given power, by a two-thirds vote, to 
retire, on his or her application, any member of the teaching staff who 
has been engaged in teaching thirty years, and any member of the 
supervising staff who has been engaged in that work or in teaching 
for thirty-five years, fifteen of which have been spent in the District 
of Columbia. (Atlantic Educational Journal.) 
TEACHERS’ SALARY COMMISSION FOR NEW YORK CITY. 
Mayor McClellan, of New York City, in June, 1909, appointed a 
commission consisting of Hon. Joseph H. Choate; Mr. William C. 
Brown, president of the New York Central Railroad; and Prof. 
John C. Clark, of Columbia University, to investigate the financial 
needs of the teachers of New York City. Its duties will be to in- 
vestigate— ; 
first, the average rates of living of teachers, both men and women, in this city,” 
and to ascertain, if possible, the general trend of responsibilities which they 
have to meet on the salary offered by this city; second, to compare, as near 
as possible, the salary rates in other cities with those offered in this city; third, 
to investigate and accurately determine what increases to the budget such 
recommendations as they may deem proper to submit will make. 
SAN FRANCISCO TEACHERS NOT CITY, BUT SCHOOL DISTRICT 
EMPLOYEES. 
On March 10, 1909, on the urgent recommendation of Mayor 
Taylor, the board of education of San Francisco passed a resolution 
that, beginning August 1, all teachers in the schools must live within 
the city, as required by the city charter. 
A teacher brought suit to restrain the board from enforcing the 
rule. 
The city attorney, in an opinion, held that teachers were not city 
employees, but employees of the school district, an entirely separate 
body politic from the city and county of San Francisco, and subject 
to the provisions of the general school law and not those of the city 
charter. 
On August 10, 1909, Judge Graham, of San Francisco, ruled that 
the resolution of the board of education could not be enforced, and 
issued a restraining order, saying: 
i The political code of the State fixes no such residential qualification. The 
board can not add to the qualifications for dismissal as laid down in the State 
law. 
  
Rhode Island establishes minimum salary of $400 per annum for 
teachers in all public schools of the State. (Act of May 7, 1909.)

BUSINESS. _ 
NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF COMMERCE. 
The Northwestern University School of Commerce was organized 
in June, 1908, sixty business men of Chicago, members of the Chicago 
Association of Commerce, the Illinois Society of Certified Account- 
ants, and the Industrial Club of Chicago, assuming financial responsi- 
bility for the school during the first three years of its existence. 
The cooperation of the university with active business men insures 
the maintenance of university standards and serves at the same time 
to keep the instruction in close touch with actual business life and 
modern commercial methods. | 
To-accommodate the large number of men who are precluded by 
their employment from pursuing regular day work at a university, 
* the school began by inaugurating, in October, 1908, an evening course 
leading to a diploma in commerce. This work is given five evenings 
a week, between the hours of 7 and 9, from October to May, inclusive. 
Students who are able to carry the work of four courses one evening 
each per week can complete the diploma course in three years. : work bee 
The demand for business training of university grade among men 
regularly employed in business has been amply demonstrated by the 
success of the school during its first year. In the six courses offered, 
constituting together only a small part of the ultimate curriculum, 
there have been registered a total of 255 students. 
In accordance with the plan of expansion adopted when the school 
was organized, the size of the faculty has been greatly increased and 
the amount of instruction offered during the ensuing year (1909-10) 
will be more than double that of the year just ended. 
The establishment of a degree course in the near future is contem- 
plated. Requirements for admission to this course will probably be 
essentially as follows: Applicants will be required to present at 
entrance at least two full years of credit in a college of recognized 
standing. 
It is not proposed to confine the work in commerce to students in 
evening courses. A large proportion of the subjects which should 
come within the scope of a day course in commerce are now offered 
at Evanston, as a regular part of the curriculum in the College of 
Liberal Arts. The combined course in Evanston and Chicago will 
' offer a maximum opportunity for cultural development directed to 
practical ends. (Announcement, 1909-10.)

HARVARD GRADUATE SCHOOL OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION. 
Harvard University has created the degree of master in business 
administration, to be conferred on graduates from the graduate school 
of business administration. 
The enrollment of students in the school at the opening of the 
school year was 56, of whom more than half devoted their entire time 
to the school as regular students. President Eliot stated in his annual 
report (1908) that— 
the general project, though novel, has commended itself very much to both the 
educational and the business world; and it is apparent from the increased 
choosing for the current year of courses in economics that a considerable num- 
ber of undergraduates are preparing to become members later of the graduate 
school of business administration. 
CLEVELAND HIGH SCHOOL OF COMMERCE. 
The board of education of Cleveland, Ohio, has established the 
Cleveland High School of Commerce, which will be opened for 
instruction in the fall of 1909. The school year is divided into four 
terms of twelve weeks each, with a vacation of one week between 
terms. Twelve quarters are necessary to complete the course of study, 
and a student may therefore complete the course in three years. The 
aim of the school is to afford efficient training for mercantile pursuits, 
and opportunity to specialize is given in the third and fourth years. 
The course of study includes instruction in English language and 
literature, mathematics, commercial geography, local industries, 
physiology, botany, physics, chemistry, history of commerce, Ameri- 
can history, political economy, civics, municipal activities, German, 
French, Spanish, penmanship, business practice, bookkeeping, sten- 
ography, typewriting, accounting, transportation, business organiza- 
tion, auditing, freehand drawing and design, mechanical drawing, 
music, and physical training. 
  
The High School of Commerce, Boston, Mass., through the public 
spirit of certain Boston business men, was enabled to establish travel- 
ing scholarships, and during the summer of 1908 sent two young men 
from the senior class on a trip of visitation and observation to the 
east coast of South America. This school has entered upon a system 
of cooperation with the business men of Boston, by which some of the 
students are enabled during the summer months to work in business 
establishments. 
Tufts College, Massachusetts, has received a bequest of $500,000 
from Mr. Henry J. Braker for the purpose of establishing a school 
 
-P-A-G-E-136

of commerce, accounts, and finance. According to the report of 
the president of Tufts College for 1907-8 it is hardly probable that 
the school can be opened for the reception of students before 
September, 1910. 
Dr. Benjamin M. Rastall has been appointed associate professor of 
business administration in the university extension division in the 
University of Wisconsin. Seventy-eight courses in business organ- 
ization and methods are to be offered by correspondence. These 
include credits and collections, salesmanship, advertising, office meth- 
ods, business correspondence, markets and buying, accounting, and 
commercial law. 
CONSULAR SERVICE. 
NEW COURSE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN. 
The present training courses preparatory to consular service given 
at the University of Wisconsin are to receive an important addition 
next semester in the form of a new course on the consular service, to 
be conducted by Dr. Ernst C. Meyer, formerly of the United States 
consular service at Chemnitz, Sonneberg, and Dresden, and recently 
appointed lecturer in political science at the university. 
The new course is to treat of the modern consular system, and will 
include a comparative study of the present organization and opera- 
tion, emphasis being placed on the existing rights, privileges, powers, 
and duties of American consuls. The larger matters of consular 
organization and functions which are of general interest and value 
will also be considered. 
Doctor Meyer will give a course in municipal government which is 
to consist of a comparative study of the systems of city government 
of leading European countries and of those of the United: States, 
with a discussion of municipal functions and current questions of 
municipal administration. (University Bulletin, February, 1909.) 
MODERN LANGUAGES. 
“ COSMOPOLITAN SCHOOLS” IN CALIFORNIA. 
An act of the legislature of California, approved March 18, 1909, 
provides that the board of education in every city of the first class 
shall establish and maintain in each of said cities of the first class at 
least one public school in which shall be taught the French, Italian, 
and German languages in conjunction with studies in the English 
language. Such schools shall be designated as “ cosmopolitan schools.”

ENGINEERING. 
COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING OF THE NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY, 
EVANSTON, ILL. 
The trustees of Northwestern University took action in June, 1907, 
which resulted in the establishment of the College of Engineering. 
Mrs. Gustavus F. Swift, of Chicago, and her son, Edward F. Swift, 
gave funds for the erection of an engineering building and for its 
endowment. The building, an imposing structure, was completed in 
March, 1909, and will be known as the “ Swift Hall of Engineering.” 
The basement floor will accommodate an engine laboratory and a 
dynamo laboratory. On the first floor is a spacious lecture hall 
seating 200 persons and a laboratory for the study of hydraulics. 
The lecture room is lighted by indirect illumination. The second 
floor will be given up to a laboratory and lecture room in mechanics, 
a library, reading room for students and for the use of the Engineer- 
ing Club, and to recitation rooms and offices. The third floor will 
accommodate a large drawing room, offices, class rooms, and a model 
room. The fourth floor comprises a drawing room, blueprint room, 
dark room, machine shop, and a large space for the storage of 
apparatus. 
The College of Engineering offers two courses of study, alike in 
character and nearly the same in content. In the first, civil engineer- 
ing subjects receive the most attention, while in the second course 
mechanical and electrical engineering are made prominent. The arts 
and science work is the same in both courses. 
In the work of the College of Engineering certain features will be 
emphasized, as appears from the following statement from the an- 
nouncement for 1909-10: 
Hach engineering course will extend through five years, and will require satis- 
factory employment during a part of each summer vacation. This extension of 
the time beyond the usual four-year course is made because of the large amount 
of liberalizing work introduced, and because five years is not too long a period 
for the intelligent young man to spend in preparation for the higher positions 
in engineering. 
A liberal education is believed to be essential to the highest success of the 
engineer, and the attempt is made to give every student such an education along 
with his engineering work. To this end the studies required by the college of 
liberal arts for the degree of bachelor of science are included in each course of 
the Engineering College. 
NEW COURSES FOR MINING ENGINEERS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN. 
The newly established department of mining engineering at the 
University of Wisconsin has just published (April, 1909) a bulletin 
announcing 13 special courses in mining engineering for undergrad- 
uates, and an advanced course is being arranged for next year. 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
  126 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
Ore dressing and assay laboratories are to be equipped in a building 
formerly occupied by the heating plant. 
The course in excavation and quarrying will include railway grad- 
ing, support of excavations, canal and submarine excavation, explo- 
sives, blasting, and allied subjects. Tunneling, boring, and shaft 
sinking will form another course, in which the ventilation, drainage, 
and timbering of mine shafts will be considered, with methods of 
sinking shafts through quicksands, rock, and earth, and hoisting 
expedients. 
In the course on prospecting and mine development the relation of 
mining geology to exploration will precede the various forms of pros- 
pecting on the surface and by shafts and drifts, and the development 
of veins discovered. A separate course in exploration of mines will 
aid the student in learning methods of hydraulic and dredge mining, 
ways of coal mining, and salt and sulphur mining, with the mainte- 
nance of entries and air ways. 
Mine accidents, their causes, control, and prevention, and rescue of 
men will be treated in the general course on mine engineering, in 
which the design, installation, and operation of all sorts of systems 
for draining, ventilating, lighting, hoisting, hauling, and signaling in 
mines will be taught. The generating and transmitting of power for 
surface plants, with the buildings, roads, and water supply for them 
will be a part of the work. 
One of the advanced courses will cover the subjects of gold and 
silver milling and cyanidation, showing how stamp mills are operated, 
the forms of amalgamation, and methods of treating precious metals. 
UTAH ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION. 
By an act approved March 11, 1909, the legislature of Utah estab- 
lished the Utah engineering experiment station as a department of 
the state school of mines of the University of Utah. The station is 
authorized— 
to carry on experiments and investigations pertaining to any and all questions 
and problems that admit of experimental and scientific methods of study and 
the solution of which would tend to benefit the industrial interests of the State, 
or would be for the public good; also to publish bulletins and employ other 
feasible means of giving information to the public concerning the results of 
experiments and other work of the station. 
It is not authorized to concern itself with problems that properly 
belong to the agricultural experiment station. 
  
JOURNALISM. 
UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN. 
The course in journalism at the University of Wisconsin is a four- 
year course, leading to the degree of bachelor of arts. The condi-
-P-A-G-E-139
  
  DEPARTMENTS AND BRANCHES OF STUDY. 127 
tions of admission are those governing entrance to the college of 
letters and science of the university. The following information 
concerning this course is compiled from University Bulletin No. 296 
(May, 1909) : 
The course includes studies of three kinds: (1) Those designed to familiarize 
the student with present social, political, and industrial conditions in the light 
of their history and development, as well as with the literature of his own and 
other languages; (2) those designed to develop the power of expressing his ideas 
. effectively in writing; (3) those intended to give the necessary technical in- 
struction in the history, development, organization, and methods of modern 
journalism. The course has been arranged in the belief that although the 
greater part of the time should be devoted to a study of the subjects of the 
-first group, such as history, political science, economics, sociology, philosophy, 
psychology, language, and literature, which are fundamental to journalistic 
work, four years of practical training in all the details of newspaper work can 
also be given as a part of a regular college course. 
The technical courses in journalism proper have been arranged with a view 
to giving four years’ instruction and practice in all the important details of 
newspaper work. Two courses are devoted to the work of the reporter and 
correspondent, one to editing, one to editorial writing, and one to special feature 
and magazine work. The instruction includes a consideration of the organiza- 
tion and management of daily and weekly newspapers; the methods of local, 
state, and national news gathering; the mechanical side of newspaper making; 
and the history and development of American journalism. In addition to the 
regular instruction, special lectures on various phases of journalistic work are 
given every year by newspaper and magazine editors. 
Practical experience in all kinds of newspaper work is given in the courses 
in journalism ‘and on the Daily Cardinal, the official university paper, which 
is edited by the students in these courses, under the direction of the instructor. 
Students in courses 1 and 2 (newspaper writing and reporting) act as reporters 
on the Cardinal; those in course 3 (newspaper editing) fill, in rotation, the 
positions of managing editor, assistant managing editor, exchange editor, city 
or university editor, and copy readers; those in course 4 (editorial writing) 
do the editorial writing as editor in chief and associate editors. As the Car- 
dinal is published at one of the Madison newspaper offices, the student editors 
become familiar with the mechanical part of newspaper publishing. 
A course in the law of the press, including the law of copyright, literary 
property, libel, privileged publication, and other topics relative to the publica- 
tion of books and newspapers, and a course in current political topics and their 
effective literary presentation, are given for the students preparing for jour- 
nalism by the department of political science. 
The advanced courses in journalism, history, political science, political 
economy, and English offer students the opportunity of doing graduate work 
in preparation for journalism. 
A newspaper office, with typewriters, files, indexes, and reference books, is 
maintained as a laboratory for the students of journalism. Index and filing 
cases are maintained to show the methods of preserving photographs, illustra- 
tions, clippings, and biographical material. 
Although the course outlined is designed primarily for those preparing for 
newspaper and editorial work, the arrangement can be readily modified to 
meet the needs of students desiring preparation for technical or trade jour- 
nalism, Courses especially designed to meet the needs of those who desire to  
-P-A-G-E-140

take up agricultural journalism, either as contributors or editors, are offered 
in the College of Agriculture. 
The students of the university edit and manage a number of publications, all 
of which offer excellent opportunities for practical experience in various kinds 
of journalistic work. Places on the editorial and business staffs of these 
publications are awarded for the most part on a basis of literary and executive 
ability and are open to practically all students of the university. 
In accordance with the elective system of the university, students preparing 
for journalism are not restricted to a fixed course of study, but are permitted 
to elect any studies which they are qualified to pursue. 
UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI. 
The school of journalism of the University of Missouri is a pro- 
fessional school ‘for training in journalism, taking rank with the 
schools of education, engineering, law, and medicine. 
The distinctive feature of the work offered by the school of jour- 
nalism consists in the courses in the history and principles of jour- 
nalism, comparative journalism, reporting, newspaper correspond- 
ence, editorial writing, newspaper jurisprudence, illustrative art, 
newspaper publishing, advertising, and newspaper administration. 
While all knowledge may be helpful to the journalist, those branches 
which bear directly upon his daily work are most important. Among 
these, in addition to the professional courses, are English, history, 
economics, government, finance, sociology, and psychology. 
A small but well-balanced general newspaper, the University 
Missourian, is issued each school-day afternoon, giving to students 
actual laboratory work, the training of a real newspaper office. This 
laboratory work has been developed to supplement class instruction 
in the gathering, handling, and presentation of news and comment. 
The requirements for admission are those of the college of arts and 
science; but beginning with 1911 two years of college work, or its 
equivalent, will be required for entrance to this school. Only one 
undergraduate degree is conferred, that of bachelor of science in 
journalism. 
In order to secure the degree of bachelor of science (B. 8.) in 
journalism, the student must fulfill the following conditions: 
1. He must be regularly admitted to the department. 
2. He must complete during the first two years of his course five 
hours i. e., five periods a week for one semester) of English, five 
hours of history, and ten hours of the other social sciences (eco- 
nomics, sociology, political science), five hours of physical or bio- 
logical science (astronomy, chemistry, geology, and mineralogy, 
physics, botany, zoology, physiology), five hours of modern languages, 
and five hours of mathematics or logic and psychology. 
3. He must complete work in journalism to the amount of twenty- 
four hours. The greater portion of this work should be taken during 
the junior and senior years.

Courses in or schools of journalism have been organized or are in 
contemplation in several other universities, principally in the Middle 
West. The University of Virginia announces a course in journalism 
in its school of English literature, which “aims to give the student 
such instruction and practice in journalism as can be given outside of 
a newspaper office.” Columbia University several years ago received 
a million dollars from Mr. Pulitzer, proprietor of the World news- 
paper, for the endowment of a school of journalism, but it has not 
yet been put in operation. The students of Cornell University pub- 
lish the Cornell Daily Sun, which is said by a critic unfriendly to 
schools of journalism to be a better school of that kind than any 
board of trustees or faculty could produce. 
MEDICINE. 
COUNCIL ON MEDICAL EDUCATION OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. 
The Fifth Annual Conference of the Council on Medical Education 
of the American Medical Association was held in Chicago, April 5, 
1909. Besides the members of the council there were 90 delegates, 
representing 21 state examining boards, 3 national medical associa- 
tions, medical colleges, colleges of liberal arts, state medical societies, 
and departments of the National Government. The council on ‘med- 
ical education is a permanent committee on education of the Ameri- 
can Medical Association, and has its headquarters in Chicago with 
the association. The conference, therefore, was fully representative 
of American medical education, and its proceedings were of great 
importance. 
The chairman of the council, Dr. Arthur Dean Bevan, of Chicago, 
was explicit in his statement that the council was only an advisory 
body; that its conclusions were not binding on state boards or medical 
colleges. Doctor Bevan made the opening address, in which he re- 
ferred to the work of the four preceding conferences and concluded 
with mentioning the needs of the present time. At the third confer- 
ence, in 1907, a full report on the medical colleges of the United 
States was made after a personal inspection. Eighty-two colleges 
were reported as acceptable, having a grade of over 70, out of a

possible 100; 46 were placed in a conditional group, while 32 were 
rejected. At the fourth conference, in 1908, a full report was made 
of medical education in the United States and in 20 other of the most 
important countries of the world. It was stated that more than 50 
first-class medical schools in this country had agreed to require an 
additional preparatory year, to be given to physics, chemistry, and 
biology. The state medical examining boards were reported to be 
the most effective agents in raising the standard both of preliminary 
education and of the regular course. 
College mergers.—Doctor Bevan commended the plan of merging 
two or more medical schools into one strong institution. In Indiana 
all of the regular schools were consolidated with the state university ; 
the university of Louisville, Ky., now represents five former medical 
schools; in Cincinnati, two schools have been consolidated, and two 
in Minneapolis. 
Report of the secretary.—Dr. N. P. Colwell, secretary of the coun- 
cil, made a report of the work of the past year. A serious difficulty 
in the way of securing adequate general education of medical students 
was the lack of good, well-equipped high schools in some of the 
Northern States as well as in the Southern. In the latter section 
great progress is being made in the establishment of high schools, 
and it is thought that in a few years this obstacle will be removed. 
Seventeen medical schools now require for admission two or more 
years of work in a college of liberal arts; 11 other schools announce 
that they will require two years, and 22 others will require one year 
of a college course. Six state examining boards have adopted a regu- 
lation requiring one or more years of a college course as the prelim- 
inary education of applicants for medical licensure; Minnesota and 
North Dakota require two years; South Dakota, Colorado, Kansas, 
and Connecticut require one year. Several other States are contem- 
plating similar action. 
After the consolidation of the medical schools in Louisville, Ky., 
the city granted the medical school an appropriation of $25,000 and 
took steps to provide a new city hospital, to be under the control 
of the school. A new city hospital will also be built in Cincinnati, 
adjacent to the medical school, and a new medical college building 
will be erected. 
The College of Medicine of the University of Southern California 
has become a department of the state university, and hereafter the 
work of the first two years will be at Berkeley, while that of the 
last two years may be either in San Francisco or Los Angeles. 
Cooper Medical College, of San Francisco, has become the medical 
department of Leland Stanford Junior University and will be 
located at Palo Alto. The number of medical schools is now re- 
ported as 148, while five years ago there were 166. Two of these,
-P-A-G-E-143
    DEPARTMENTS AND BRANCHES OF STUDY. 131 
which formerly gave instruction at night, have changed to day 
schools. 
Three state boards, those of Colorado, Massachusetts, and Ohio, included 
practical tests in the examination of applicants for license. These tests in- 
cluded the making of urinalyses and the identification under the microscope of 
histologic, pathologic, and bacterial specimens. ‘Two other boards, those of 
Indiana and Minnesota, have announced that practical tests will hereafter be 
required. 
In three States—Alabama, Arkansas, and Rhode Island—amendments to the 
practice acts have been secured requiring that all applicants for license be 
graduates of reputable medical colleges. This leaves only three States—Massa- 
chusetts, Mississippi, and Tennessee—which still allow nongraduates to secure 
licenses other than through reciprocity. 
Indiana, Iowa, and Nebraska have provided for examinations in two parts, 
whereby the fundamental medical branches may be passed at the end of the 
sophomore year, this credit to be accepted toward the examination for license 
after the student has graduated. There are now eight States having this two- 
part examination, as follows: Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan, 
Nebraska, New York, and Virginia. 
In only one instance during the past four years has a State retrograded in 
its standards for medical licensure. This occurred during the last year in 
Oklahoma. * * * 
In only a few States is there any check on the incorporation or chartering 
of medical schools. In most States any body of men, by paying the required 
fee, can incorporate as a college or university, often with authority to grant 
any degree under the sun, no question being asked as to the ability to furnish 
education of the standard generally supplied by the better colleges and uni- 
versities. And seldom is there any means of control over such institutions, 
even after they are incorporated. 
No such unchecked educational institutions are allowed to exist in any other 
country and, so far as we have been able to learn, in no other country are to 
be found so many medical sects or pseudo-medical institutions. There are now 
some 80 or more nondescript medical fads in a long procession demanding 
legal recognition, separate boards, or representation on examining boards. In 
some instances the influence has been seriously demoralizing. 
The conclusions reached by the secretary are: 
1. There are too many medical colleges in the United States, being 
nearly as many as in all the rest of the world combined. 
2. As a result, there is an active competition for students, with a 
resultant disregard of preliminary qualifications and a hindrance to 
the development of high schools. 
3. The methods of teaching in vogue fifteen or twenty years ago 
are still pursued in some medical schools. 
4. Medicine to-day really demands more than a high-school edu- 
cation, and there should be at least one year’s work in physics, 
chemistry, and biology, and a reading knowledge of French and 
German. 
5. Medical schools need trained teachers, and, for the fundamental 
sciences, men giving their entire time, and paid full salaries.
-P-A-G-E-144
  132 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
6. Medical schools must have hospitals owned by them or under 
their control. The patients would receive better attention from the 
attending physicians on account of the presence of students. They 
should also have proper supervision. 
7. Medical schools should be departments of universities in reality, 
not in name only, and they should be liberally endowed. 
8. Reciprocity of licensure should be allowed in all the States, as 
its denial would involve great hardship on old practitioners who 
desire to move to another State, but it should have safeguards pre- 
venting young graduates from seeking admission by it to a State 
where they failed on examination. It should only secure a waiver 
of the examination, not of the other requirements. 
Standard medical curriculum.—The medical curriculum had been 
divided into ten sections, and as many committees had been appointed 
to report upon them. The council indorsed the recommendation of 
several of the committees that state examining boards cooperate in 
the effort for more thorough and sound instruction by confining 
their questions on drugs to the important and commonly used ones. 
The committee on anatomy condemned the old lecture system, which 
has given place to laboratory examinations and dissections. The 
average yearly expenditures for the anatomic departments were 
given as follows: At five endowed institutions, $19,600; at four state 
universities, $11,600. In surgery it was recommended that, not- 
withstanding the great progress that has been made in surgery, young 
graduates who have not served as internes in a hospital should not 
~ at once undertake full practice in surgery, unless located in rural 
communities where no experienced surgeon is accessible. In obstet- 
rics it was stated that over 6,000 women die annually in confinement, 
and that countless numbers are made invalids by injuries received 
at such times. 
Practical ewamination of medical students—Dr. Wm. T. Council- 
man, of the Harvard Medical School, is an earnest advocate of 
reform in examinations by state medical boards. He claims that the 
written examination, heretofore almost universally depended upon, 
is not an adequate test of fitness to practice, and that a serious objec- 
tion to it is that it encourages wrong methods of medical education ; 
that the medical schools endeavor to prepare their students to answer 
questions of the medical boards, instead of how to recognize and treat 
disease. He goes on to say: 
That this [the written examination] is the easiest and the quickest method 
of examination no one will deny. ‘That it is an absolutely unsuitable method 
every one who has been engaged in teaching and examining students will rec- 
ognize. In the first place there is a very great difficulty in the preparation of 
questions which will really test a candidate’s knowledge. * * * The matter 
of examination passing has been rendered very much more facile by the prepa- 
ration of quiz compends in which the questions of state boards are analyzed 
 
-P-A-G-E-145
  DEPARTMENTS AND BRANCHES OF STUDY. 133 
and suita\e’ answers given. Any man of proper intelligence by the use of 
such a quiz compend can prepare himself in the course of a few months for 
such an examination without any real medical training at all. 
The examination for admission to the practice of medicine should not be a 
written examination, to show what the candidate remembers and can write, 
but a practical examination to show what he really knows and can do. The 
real efficiency of a medical man depends largely on his knowledge of methods 
of diagnosis and treatment and his facility in the use of these methods, and that 
a candidate has this knowledge and ability can only be tested by the actual 
demonstration. This, I think, will be admitted on all sides. 
The objections which are urged against such methods of examination are 
numerous. In the first place, it is said that the examiners themselves at present 
are incapable of conducting such examinations. If this be true, and I hardly 
believe it, they should give up their offices to those who are capable of conduct- 
ing such examinations. * * * It is also said that the state boards have 
not the facilities for conducting such examinations. This is not true. I feel 
perfectly sure that every assistance will be given to the state examining boards 
by the medical schools in the State. ‘They will offer their laboratories and all 
their facilities. The examination should not be held in places where facilities 
of this sort can not be provided. The laboratory side of the practical examina- 
tion is the least. The practical examination should embrace the clinical as 
well as the laboratory side of medicine. There is no difficulty whatever in 
providing material for the clinical examination. 
As already stated, three States have adopted the practical-examina- 
tion method, and it seems probable that it will be very generally 
tried, and if the time and necessary facilities can be provided it will 
continue in use. The secretary of the Massachusetts board says that 
their experience indicates that it is practicable to conduct examina- 
tions in microscopy, in the laboratory, and with the manikin along 
the lines of practical work. 
The use of the microscope, stethoscope, anatomic demonstrations, bandaging, 
the application of surgical dressings, etc., will hereafter figure prominently in 
our examinations. 
Dr. Richard H. Whitehead, of Charlottesville, Va., spoke of medi- 
cal education in the South and the difficulty of adopting higher 
standards of preliminary education at present, but felt that this . 
trouble would soon be removed. He says: 
I am confident that it would be a mistake, so far as the South is concerned, 
for this council to lower the standard out of consideration for southern diffi- 
culties, or for any other reason. On the contrary, the South needs that stand- 
ard as a goal to be striven for; and it must not expect other sections of the 
country to retard their own progress. It must, in large measure, work out its 
own medical salvation; not in fear and trembling, however, but with courage, 
patience, and wisdom. That it can and will do so, I have no doubt. The 
revival in education—primary, secondary, and collegiate—now going on in 
many Southern States is, perhaps, imperfectly understood and appreciated in 
the North and West. It is a movement of great extent and power, well organ- 
ized, and intelligently directed toward a definite end. Just at present the bulk 
of this effort is being expended on the secondary schools. The public secondary 
schools have been strengthened greatly, and 680 new ones have come into
-P-A-G-E-146
  134 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. . 
existence in the last three years. During the same time there are fer southern 
colleges of any standing which have not increased their requirements by 
amounts varying from 25 to 150 per cent. Moreover, the material wealth of 
the South is increasing so rapidly that it promises soon to become a most 
prosperous country. The spread of the idea of local taxation guarantees in the 
near future a system of public schools of definite and permanent importance. 
So that the day is not so very far off when there will exist the proper basis 
for high standards in medical education. Already the leaven of high ideals is 
working in at least three southern universities. | And so, I say, do not worry 
about the South; it will work out its educational development in due time. 
In the meanwhile the council can be of much service by stimulating, encourag- 
ing, helping—but not by lowering its standard. 
Dr. Egbert Le Fevre, of University and Bellevue Hospital Medi- 
cal College, favored a broader training for entrance to medical 
schools, and the requirement of a knowledge of chemistry, physics, 
and biology. He doubted, however, whether this would be secured 
by the requirement of one or two years of a collegiate course. 
Ninety-eight per cent of those who enter college do so without know- 
ing what profession they will enter, and the instruction they receive 
there is designed to give a liberal education, not to prepare for med- 
ical study. Student work in colleges is not intensive, while in medical 
schools it is intensive. Moreover, a large number of medical gradu- 
ates, 69 per cent in Bellevue, secure hospital appointments. There 
they receive valuable technical instruction. 
Dr. John M. Dodson, dean of Rush Medical College, spoke of the 
difficulty under which the medical schools of Chicago labor, where 
they instruct students from many different States. The colleges 
endeavor to comply with the requirements of the state examining 
boards, but find it difficult on account of the variations. One State 
specifies a curriculum of 27 branches, giving the exact number of 
hours to be devoted to recitations, to laboratory work, to clinical 
work, etc. Another board will make a different arrangement. He 
therefore urges that examining boards, while insisting on a com- 
plete, practical medical training, shall not hamper the progress of 
education by preventing experiments in new and possibly better 
methods. 
MUSIC, 
MUSIC TEACHERS’ NATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
The Thirtieth Annual Convention of the Music Teachers’ National 
Association was held in Washington, D. C., December 28, 29, and 
80, 1908. Of especial educational interest was the adoption of the 
report of the subcommittee on public schools, which recommends 
raising the standards of attainment in music among public-school 
children.
-P-A-G-E-147
  
DEPARTMENTS AND BRANCHES OF STUDY. 135 
The report as read follows: 
AIM AND REQUIREMENT. 
The proper study of music trains the intellect, awakens the emotional nature, 
provides a medium for the expression of emotion, develops a love for the beauti- 
ful, leads to the recognition and appreciation of great works of art, adds to the 
pleasures of life, and exerts a cultivating and inspiring influence on character, 
GENERAL AIM. 
1. Briefly stated, the aim is as follows: First, to develop an appreciation of 
good music; second, to develop the emotional nature and the esthetic sense by 
the interpretation of good music; third, to teach the language of music for 
reading and singing. 
2. More specifically stated, the aim in the teaching of music in the grammar 
schools is to present the subject so that a pupil at graduation shall have 
acquired : 
(a) The ability to render any standard song, previously prepared, with agree- 
able tone and phrasing (implying breath control); feeling for the spirit, the 
tempo, and character of the song. 
(b) First, the ability to sing at sight, with words, a melody of moderate 
difficulty, such as the easier hymn tunes and folk songs, or any part of a three 
or four part song of that degree of difficulty ; second, the ability to sing at sight 
an eight-measure phrase, without words, in any major or minor key, with any 
time signature, employing the use of one, two, three, or four tones to the beat, 
common forms of the unequally divided beat, syncopation and chromatic tones 
in common use. 
(c) First, for writing, the knowledge of all fundamental principles of time, 
note values, measure structure, and signatures; second, the knowledge of two 
clefs, all fundamental knowledge of keys and key signatures, major and minor, 
sufficient knowledge of the five characters used to represent chromatic tones to * 
insure intelligent reading; third, the knowledge of common Italian terms for 
tempo and expression. 
(d) Some knowledge of good musical literature, implying the memorizing of 
some standard songs or themes from compositions, with some biographical 
knowledge of the great composers, 
Attention should be given to ear training and tone production. 
It will be the policy of the association in the future to seek to at- 
tain ends similar to those suggested in this report in high schools, 
colleges, and universities. 
Papers were read on other phases of musical education by Albert 
A. Stanley, of the University of Michigan; Henry Suzzallo, of 
Teachers College; Leonard B. McWhood, of Columbia University; 
President Waldo S. Pratt, of the Hartford Theological Seminary; 
Frederick W. Root, of Chicago; George L. Raymond, George Wash- 
ington University ; George W. Chadwick, of New England Conserva- 
tory of Music; Arthur L. Manchester, of Converse College; Oscar G. 
Sonneck, Library of Congress; and William H. Hunniston, of New 
York City. 
The principal officers of the association for 1909 are Rossetter G. 
Cole, University of Wisconsin, president; Ralph L. Baldwin, Hart- 
ford, Conn., secretary.

POLITICAL SCIENCE. 
A new course in the administration of punitive justice, to be given 
in the department of political science at the University of Wisconsin 
this year by Prof. R. B. Scott, will deal with the methods of discover- 
ing, prosecuting, and punishing crime; the functions of the police, 
prosecuting officials, and jury; and the defects in the administration 
of criminal laws. 
Another new course in the same department is that by Dr. Paul S. 
Reinsch on Latin-American political institutions, in which he will 
present a comparative study of the constitutional and administrative 
systems of the Latin-American republics. (University Bulletin, Aug. 
16, 1909.) 
RAILWAY ADMINISTRATION. 
The University of Michigan announces for 1909-10 a special course 
in railway administration. It is the design of this course to provide 
university instruction for four classes of students: 
First. Those who desire to enter any of the business or adminis- 
trative departments of railway service. 
Second. Those who desire to enter the service of the federal or the 
state governments as statisticians or economic investigators for rail- 
way commissions or other bureaus which have to do with the admin- 
istration of laws touching the business of transportation. 
Third. Those who propose to undertake statistical or appraisal 
work as a feature of the business of banking or brokerage. 
Fourth. Those who desire to attain, as a part of a general educa- 
tion, a scholarly understanding of that complex set of industrial and 
governmental interests and activities which make up what is known 
as the “transportation problem.” 
The programme offered covers four lines of instruction: 
1. General courses in mathematics, physics, chemistry, modern lan- 
guage, and rhetoric, such as are required of all candidates for a degree, 
and in addition eighteen credit hours of general elections. 
2. From the law department there have been selected certain courses 
of especial significance to students of transportation, on the ground 
that a man who is to move up in the railway service or who is to 
assume a position of responsibility in government employment should 
know certain fundamental principles of law. 
Among the required subjects will be found courses in contracts, in 
bailments and carriers, and in railway law. 
3. The faculty of the engineering department also provides certain 
lines of instruction of importance to students of the economics of 
transportation. Among these courses may be mentioned shop prac-
-P-A-G-E-149

tice, surveying, prime movers, and specifications and contracts. A 
special course in drawing and projections, given in the literary de- 
partment, and a course in railway engineering, given jointly by in- 
structors from the engineering and literary departments, fall within 
this group of studies. 
4, The department of political economy must, however, furnish the 
larger part of the special instruction offered in this course. Besides 
the general courses which this department offers, certain technical or 
semiprofessional courses have been provided, such as principles of 
accounting, railway organization and operation, railway finance, rail- 
way tariffs, and railway statistics and accounts. (Compiled from 
University Bulletin, Vol. X, No. 20.) 
XI. AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION. 
ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURAL COLLEGES AND 
EXPERIMENT STATIONS. 
The Twenty-second Annual Convention of the Association of 
American Agricultural Colleges and Experiment Stations was held 
at Washington, D. C., November 18-20, 1908. In addition to the 
delegates, a number of visitors representing foreign agricultural de- 
partments, societies, and institutions were admitted to the privileges 
of the floor. 
The committee on graduate study, in their report, urged the con- 
tinuance of the graduate school, and recommended that every college 
and experiment station make arrangements by which at least a por- 
tion of its staff might have an opportunity to attend each session. 
The report of the committee on extension work, of which President 
Kenyon L. Butterfield, of the Massachusetts Agricultural College, was 
chairman, emphasized the pressing need of organized work at the ag- 
ricultural colleges to reach more completely the working farmers of 
the country. It was stated that probably not one farmer in twenty- 
five ever attends a farmers’ institute. The recommendation that each 
institution represented in the association organize as soon as possible 
a definite scheme of extension work in agriculture was approved by 
the convention. 
In view of the circumstance that the trustees of the Carnegie 
Foundation have consented to admit to its benefits institutions of the 
class of the land-grant colleges on certain conditions (see p. 88), the 
convention, by formal resolution, expressed its appreciation of this 
action. Dr. Henry S. Pritchett, president of the Carnegie Founda- 
tion, addressed the convention upon the functions and policy of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
  138 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
foundation, upon agricultural college standards, and the relations 
of these colleges to the foundation and to the general educational 
system. The following abstract of his address, which was of general 
interest, was prepared for publication in the proceedings, which 
appeared in Bulletin 212 of the Office of Experiment Stations of the 
Department of Agriculture (issued July 10, 1909) : 
The Carnegie Foundation, which has now within its disposal some $16,000,000, 
is endowed not only as an agency for the establishment of a retiring-allowance 
system, but as a power in the direction of work in higher education. The re- 
tiring-allowance system is only one of the many avenues of work on which the 
foundation may enter. It is the first and principal work, and probably will be 
the principal work for some time to come. In administering this system it 
quickly became evident that to elevate the condition of the teaching body in 
America a retiring-allowance system must be such that men come under it as a 
right, not as a matter of vote by a board of trustees; under fixed rules, not un- 
der uncertain arrangement. The Carnegie Foundation realized that its business 
was to deal with institutions, not with individuals; to say what institutions are 
eligible by reason of the work they are doing, by reason of the standards which 
they are upholding, and by reason of their relation to the system of general edu- 
cation in their respective States; and that once an institution is declared eli- 
gible its professors shall receive retiring allowances under fixed rules, exactly 
as they receive their salaries. To carry this idea into administration, the prac- 
tice of the foundation is to pay the retiring allowance in such a recognized col- 
lege not directly to the professor, but into the treasury of the college. 
This being the basis of the retiring allowance system, the foundation was 
frankly brought to the consideration of what is a college. It found, approxi- 
mately, 1,000 colleges in the United States, Canada, and Newfoundland. By 
what rules should these colleges be admitted to share in our endowment? 
Should we say that all institutions are colleges which call themselves so, and 
attempt no educational criterion with respect to what is the work of a college? 
That would have been to throw away all educational significance from the 
foundation. 
So we were driven to the effort to discriminate between these 1,000 colleges. 
At the outset of our operations we had to study the organization of colleges 
in English-speaking America, and of course we had to consider college organi- 
zation from the standpoint, not of a single institution nor even of a great State, 
but from the standpoint of a continent. This is, I think, the first agency which 
has undertaken to examine American colleges in Maine, California, Florida, 
Colorado, in the Provinces of Canada, and in the colony of Newfoundland. 
Whether our work turns out to be wise or not, it seems to me worth while to 
have such an agency with such a point of view. 
In discriminating between the 1,000 institutions chartered as colleges we 
have assumed that in order to be truly a college or to be truly a technical school 
in the sense of higher education an institution must articulate with the stand- 
ard high school. But in order to serve the people of its State a college should 
not articulate with the standard four-year high school, unless that high school 
is a reasonable prerequisite for the kind of education the people wish to obtain. 
In other words, a college ought to place itself squarely upon the educational 
system of its State, and if that educational system includes the four-year stand- 
ard high school, then the Carnegie Foundation can recognize the college as an 
institution of higher learning. On the other hand, although by our charter the 
foundation can not recognize as an institution of higher learning a college which 
 
-P-A-G-E-151
  
AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION. 139 
is not thus based upon the standard four-year high school, a lower standard 
may be the only wise course for an institution, owing either to the nature of its 
work or to the condition of the community it is its duty to serve. For a college 
to attempt to put itself upon the top of a four-year high school, unless this 
. course was justified by the interests of the people of the whole State, would be 
an educational crime. 
The question, therefore, both for us and for you, is whether the agricultural 
and mechanical colleges supported from the land-grant donations are essen- 
tially institutions of higher education. There are really three kinds of these 
agricultural colleges. First, there is a small group of institutions, like the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Vermont, which 
are institutions upon private funds governed by self-perpetuating trustees, but 
which received a share from the original Morrill grant. This group need con- 
cern us little. The Morrill fund played but a small part in their development. 
Second, there is the group of state universities to which the Morrill grant was 
given for a separate college of agriculture within the university organization; 
and, third, there is the largest group of those institutions founded under the 
Morrill Act, supported in part by it, which undertake to furnish a course in 
agriculture and a course in what is ordinarily called the ‘‘ mechanic arts.” 
* The question of the comparative wisdom of these last two types of organiza- 
tion, whether it were wiser to make the college of agriculture a part of the state 
university, or whether it were wiser to organize the college of agriculture as a 
separate college, is a question which has already been practically settled in 
every State. There are advantages and disadvantges in both solutions. To 
have all the institutions of higher learning of a State brought into one great 
institution is a certain advantage from the standpoint of power and of the lack 
of duplication of work. It also avoids the tendency to pit one part of the 
State, which has the agricultural and mechanical college, against another part, 
which has the state university, in the attempt to secure favorable legislation. 
Also, I am inclined to think that when a college of agriculture is made a 
department of a state university it is more likely to attend to the business of 
agriculture and nothing more. The college of agriculture and mechanical arts 
has tended to become a school of engineering, with an agricultural feature 
added. For this there is a pedagogical reason—the teaching of engineering 
was already systematized when these institutions were established; it was 
pedagogically a simple thing to teach engineering. That is what mechanic 
arts came to mean. It did not mean teaching the work of a farmer or of a 
mechanic; it came to mean engineering, and from this it came to pass that 
there has been a tendency in the separate college of agriculture to develop 
along the lines of an engineering college. 
On the other hand, the separate college of agriculture has certain advantages, 
In any institution of learning we seek to separate incongruous phases of educa- 
tion. That is why we separate the high school from the college and the college 
from the university. We do this because experience has shown that we can not 
put incongruous phases of education—phases which seek to deal with men of 
very different preparation and men of very different aims—into one institution 
as successfully as we can into different institutions. 
Agriculture has certain duties, certain needs, certain opportunities which are 
distinctive, which belong to it, which do not fit together with what we have 
come to consider the work of a university. This gives the separate agricultural 
college its great advantage. Take, for example, entrance requirements. It is 
not at all clear to me yet that the entrance requirements for a student of 
agriculture ought to be the same as the entrance requirements for the ordinary

  140 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
college student. That question is an open one. I find, in looking over the 
agricultural and mechanical colleges, their curricula, their work, their cata- 
logues, and in visiting some of them, that the variation of their entrance re- 
quirements is much greater than the variation of entrance requirements in the 
state universities. Some of you have entrance requirements quite equal to 
those of the colleges of New England; some of you have entrance require- 
ments which do not necessitate one year of the standard high school. In other 
words, there is a wide divergence amongst yourselves as to what your duty 
is in education, of what your purpose is. You have not yet brought about in 
your own conception, so far as I can understand it, any uniformity as to what 
your mission is, as to what your work is, as to what your relations to educa- 
tion are to be. This is exactly what the Carnegie Foundation desires to know. 
I do not mean by this emphasis on entrance requirements that a college or 
university may deal only with the students who have regularly matriculated. 
A college which limited itself to that sort of teaching with a great body of men 
would be an extremely limited institution; a college which followed that policy 
ought really to adopt the business nomenclature of such-and-such a college, 
limited. But an institution which sets itself up to be a college and to print in 
its catalogue a list of 600 students, of whom 475 are in farmers’ courses, and 
in various courses for six weeks, does not, in my judgment, come up to the 
standard college which I allude to. You should make it clear to the people who 
come, to the public, to all who have to do with your constituency, that the extra 
work, however useful, however desirable, however important, is not college 
work. By all means do the work, but make it clear that only those are college 
students who come up to a certain standard; that the others are what the 
Germans call “ hospitanten.” 
The foundation not only wishes the agricultural colleges to make clear to us 
what their field of education is, but also what is their relation to the general 
educational system of their respective States and regions. It is not enough for 
a college to say, “ We put up our standard to a four-year high school.” I 
would say to that college, “ What arrangements have you made to have your 
men prepared for your college after you have put it up on these stilts? Where 
are the schools that are to prepare students for the college? What sort of 
relations do you have with these schools?” We can not too often bring 
before our minds that the educational system of our State is one, not a set of 
unrelated, separate schools. 
Then, finally, we ask you if you wish to come into relations with us, that in 
the establishment of your standards, concerning which, of course, we have 
nothing to say, that you make clear to us that the standards shall be real ones. 
A reasonable standard, honestly maintained, honestly lived up to, frankly and 
squarely applied, is worth more in the way of educational righteousness than 
any standard, however high, which is only on paper. 
In conclusion, I may say that I do not believe that any section of the United 
States, whether that section be north, east, south, or west, can afford to ask 
the foundation to accept special standards of entrance for itself. This is true 
if for no other reason than that the very act of asking for special standards is a 
confession of weakness. So long as one section remains outside the standard 
for which the great majority of educated men stand, just so long they cut 
themselves off from the opportunity to influence in a large way the intellectual 
standard of the whole country. I may say that since the Carnegie Foundation 
began its work three years ago great progress has been made toward the unify- 
ing of college entrance requirements. At that time there was scarcely a college 
south of Mason and Dixon’s line whose entrance requirements were such as to 
demand a four-year high-school preparation. Since that date a number of insti-
-P-A-G-E-153

tutions have placed themselves upon such a basis, and at a meeting of the 
Southern Education Association, which I attended two weeks ago, after a two 
days’ discussion the association resolved unanimously that, beginning with 1910, 
their colleges should all go upon the basis of the standard four-year high school 
as a prerequisite for college entrance. This seems to me a result not only of 
great value educationally, not only of great value socially, but also of great 
value as a national asset. 
The following officers were chosen for the ensuing year: President, 
M. A. Scovell, of Kentucky; vice-presidents—first, W. J. Kerr, of 
Oregon; second, C. E. Thorne, of Ohio; third, H. T. French, of 
Idaho; fourth, W. D. Gibbs, of New Hampshire; fifth, A. B. Storms, 
of Iowa; bibliographer, A. C. True, of Washington, D. C.; secretary 
and treasurer, J. L. Hills, of Vermont. Members of the executive 
committee: From the section on college work and administration, 
J. L. Snyder, of Michigan; W. E. Stone, of Indiana; W. O. Thomp- 
son, of Ohio; from the section on station work, W. H. Jordan, of 
New York; C. F. Curtiss, of Iowa. 
The next annual convention will be held at Portland, Oregon, 
August, 1909. 
REPORT ON THE RHODE ISLAND COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE. 
Resolution No. 8 of the general assembly of Rhode Island, passed 
May 26, 1908, designated a commission consisting of the commissioner 
of public schools; James E. Sullivan, of Narragansett; Charles H. 
Ward, of Middletown; George F. Weston, of Providence; and 
Etienne C. Delabarre, of Woonsocket (succeeded by Hormisdas J. 
Cartier, of Warwick)— 
to visit the Rhode Island College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, make a 
study of its aims, plans, and work, determine its educational value to the State, 
consider ways and means by which its service to the State may be enhanced— 
And report thereon to the general assembly in 1909. 
After a thorough examination of the work of the institution the 
commission rendered its report to the general assembly April 16, 
1909, making the following recommendations: 
In conclusion, the commission finds that, in accord with the purpose of its 
founding, the true function of the college is to provide free collegiate education 
for our youth of all classes, and that, in union of vocational and cultural educa- 
tion, its grand aim is to educate broadly for American citizenship. With this 
aim in view, the commission respectfully submits, as ways or means of increas- 
ing the value of the college, the following recommendations, which it has 
adopted after mature deliberation: 
1. That the name of the college be changed to Rhode Island State College. 
2. That the college be required by law to maintain the standard set by the 
Carnegie Foundation. 
3. That the governing board include in its membership representatives of 
public education, agriculture, and manufacturing. 
 
-P-A-G-E-154
   
    
      142 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
4, That to secure the advantages of a more permanent faculty of instruction, 
efforts be directed to insure longer terms of service to its members. 
5. That the managing board appoint official visitors, who shall report annu- 
ally to the board. 
6. That tuition be free to all students, 
7. That the extension department be enlarged and strengthened, so that the 
benefits of the college may be more widely and effectively applied, through 
correspondence, home courses, and lectures, to farming and manufacturing in- 
terests and to country and village life. 
8. That the experiment station, in practice as it is in law, be more closely 
affiliated with the college as a department to secure greater unity of effort. 
9. That the college maintain evening schools for industrial training in manu- 
facturing centers, so far as its means allow. 
10. That it offer to teachers summer courses in elementary agriculture and 
domestic arts. 
11. That the instruction now given in military science and art be expanded 
and organized as a collegiate department for efficient military training of high 
rank. That measures be taken to organize a company of engineers from en- 
listed students, to be affiliated with the Rhode Island National Guard. 
12. That the college be recognized as an integral part of the educational 
system of the State and that action be taken to bring it into closer relation with 
the high schools of the State. 
13. That, to meet the apparent needs of the college, the following buildings be 
erected as Soon aS means are available: (1) Science, (2) library, (3) auditorium, 
(4) gymnasium and drill hall. 
14. That, as favorable opportunity may offer, more land be secured to meet 
the future agricultural needs of the college, especially in experimental farming. 
15. That, in making its annual appropriations for the college, the State not 
only have regard for judicious expenditure and its financial resources, but also, 
in keeping with its dignity and honor, it give due consideration to its obligations 
assumed for the support and management of the institution in its compact 
with the National Government. 
The first three recommendations were at once acted upon favorably 
by the general assembly. 
SCHOOL FARM CONDUCTED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. 
By an act of the legislature of California passed in 1905, a school 
farm was provided for on which both the theory and the practice of 
farming could be taught. Seven hundred and eighty acres of land 
were purchased contiguous to the town of Davis and the necessary 
equipment was installed. The farm is conducted under the direction 
of the University of California. 
A notable feature of the institution is the short courses offered to 
farmers who are already engaged in farming, and whose business 
interests will not permit of a long residence away from home. These 
courses were introduced in 1908. They range in duration from two 
to eight weeks. Instruction is given in dairy manufacture; irriga- 
tion, soils, forage crops, and cereals; poultry husbandry; animal in- 
dustry and veterinary science; horticulture and viticulture, These

courses are open to all persons over 17 years of age. No entrance 
examinations are held nor is— 
any requirement imposed except an earnest desire to learn and to make the best 
use of the opportunities freely offered by the State through its university. 
The regular course designed to cover a period of three years is 
open to boys of good moral character over 15 years of age. In 
addition to training in the theory and practice of farming, instruc- 
tion is given in English, mathematics, history, and civics. No effort 
is made to prepare students for college. 
Matriculants must have completed the eighth grade of the gram- 
mar school, or must pass a satisfactory examination on the subjects 
included in the ordinary grammar school course. During the first 
year only boys have been received, owing to the lack of dormitory 
facilities and equipment for girls, but it is planned to offer in the 
near future courses in domestic science, domestic arts, and other 
subjects of interest to women in rural life. 
Prof. Leroy Anderson is superintendent of the farm. 
UNITED STATES FORESTRY STATION FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF 
WISCONSIN. 
The United States Forest Service has just decided to locate its ex- 
perimental laboratory station at the University of Wisconsin. The 
establishment of this station at the university was strongly advocated 
both by the State Timber Land Owners’ Association and by the Wis- 
consin conservation commission. 
The regents of the university at their last meeting agreed to 
provide a suitable building on the university campus for this labora- 
tory. Steps will be taken to have this building erected at the earliest 
possible date. The United States Forest Service will equip the 
laboratory, at a cost of $14,000, and will provide the entire staff of 
investigators, whose salaries will aggregate $28,000 a year. 
The new laboratory will be available to university students and 
members of the faculty for investigative work, and the members of 
the station staff will give lectures to students on the various phases 
of forestry in which work is being done in the laboratory. The uni- 
versity will thus have practically all the advantages of a school of 
forestry that will be the most thoroughly equipped in the country. 
The character of the investigations to be undertaken makes the 
establishment of the station at Wisconsin of the greatest importance 
to the paper and lumber industries of the State. Wood-pulp experi- 
ments to determine the fitness of various woods and other vegetable 
fibers for the manufacture of paper will receive much attention. A 
miniature pulp mill, fully equipped for the manufacture of pulp by

the sulphite process, together with such equipment as the lead-lined 
digester, a beating engine, a pulp screen, and a knuckle-joint press, 
will be installed. 
Timber tests to determine the mechanical properties of different 
woods and the influence on these properties of various methods of 
treating and handling will be of value to lumbermen. Testing and 
woodworking machinery valued at over $8,000 will constitute part of 
the equipment. The preservation of wood, such as railroad ties, ete., . 
by different processes and the use of preservative fluids is to be 
another important field of investigation for which complete equip- 
ment is to be provided in the form of treating cylinders, pressure and 
storage tanks, pumps, and air compressors. 
Experiments in wood distillation to determine the best methods of 
securing such products as turpentine, rosin, etc., from wood waste 
are to be carried on on a large scale. Chemical analyses of commer- 
cial products derived from wood will be conducted in the well- 
equipped chemical laboratory. 
The location of the laboratory in the heart of the great forest dis- 
trict of the country, the three great forest states being Michigan, 
Wisconsin, and Minnesota, will give the station unexcelled facilities 
for carrying on every phase of its work under the most favorable 
circumstances. (University Bulletin.) 
AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION EXTENSION. 
University of Minnesota—An act of the legislature of Minnesota 
approved April 22, 1909, authorizes and directs the establishment of 
a division of agricultural extension and home education in the depart- 
ment of agriculture of the University of Minnesota, and appropriates 
the sum of $50,000 for the purpose of establishing and maintaining 
the division during the two years beginning in September of 1909 and 
1910. It provides that all persons who reside in Minnesota shall have 
the right to take, free of charge, any courses of instruction offered in 
the division. 
Ohio State University.—An act of the legislature of Ohio, approved 
March 12, 1909, requires the college of agriculture and domestic sci- 
ence of the Ohio State University to arrange for the extension of its 
teachings throughout the State, and appropriates $20,000 for the pur- 
pose. It shall arrange to hold schools in which instruction shall be 
given in soil fertility, stock raising, crop production, dairying, horti- 
culture, domestic science, and kindred subjects. Each school shall 
not exceed one week in length, and not more than one shall be held in 
any county during a year. It shall also give instruction and demon-

AGRICULTURAL HIGH SCHOOLS. 
THE ARKANSAS SYSTEM. 
The legislature of the State of Arkansas at the session of 1909 
enacted a law for the establishment and maintenance of a public 
school of agriculture in each of four districts into which the State 
is divided for the purpose. The governor, with the concurrence of 
the senate, shall appoint in each of the districts five intelligent 
farmers to serve as a board of trustees of the school. After the first 
appointments, one member shall be appointed every second year to 
serve for a term of ten years. The course of study shall consist of at 
least practical experiment, treatises, or lectures on agriculture and 
horticulture, and as soon as practicable, and not later than one year 
after the opening of each school, there shall be established in con- 
nection therewith a textile school in which shall be taught the art of 
cotton manufacturing, and other textile manufacturing should the 
board deem it expedient. The faculty of each school shall consist 
of a principal, who shall be a graduate of some reputable school of 
agriculture; one instructor in stock raising and dairying; a competent 
textile instructor, and assistants as may be necessary. The duties of 
any of the faculty may be combined when practicable. The act pro- 
vides that after the first buildings are erected and ready for tempo- 
rary use, all work in, on, and about the schools or on the farm or 
in the barns, whether it be farming, building, care of stock, or what- 
ever kind of work, shall be performed by the students. The act 
appropriates $40,000 for each of the four schools provided for. 
MONTAGUE (MASS.) AGRICULTURAL SCHOOL. 
The Montague Agricultural School, Montague, Mass., was estab- 
lished by a vote of the town of Montague, June 30, 1908, displacing 
the Montague High School. It is organized under the Massachusetts 
commission on industrial education, and is under the management 
of a local board of trustees, in coopertion with the commission. 
The provisional course of study extends through five years and pro- 
vides courses in agriculture for boys and girls and special courses 
in carpentry and mechanical training for the boys and courses in 
sewing, cooking, and domestic science and arts for the girls. The 
faculty consists of seven persons. 
SCHOOL AT NORTHAMPTON, MASS. 
Smith’s Agricultural School and Northampton School of Tech- 
nology, at Northampton, Mass., was opened for instruction October 1, 
1908. To it are devoted the proceeds of a fund amounting to 
 
-P-A-G-E-159
  AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION. 147 
$310,660.39 bequeathed to Northampton by Mr. Oliver Smith for an 
agricultural school. The city of Northampton makes an annual main- 
tenance appropriation of $20,000, one-half of which is paid by the 
State. The institution offers four regular courses of study as fol- 
lows: Preparation for farming, preparation for mechanical work, 
and preparation for housekeeping and home making, each covering 
four years, and a course for persons desiring to enter a college of 
agriculture or a normal school. Rev. R. W. Stimson, formerly presi- 
dent of the Connecticut Agricultural College, is the director of the 
school. 
PETERSHAM (MASS.) AGRICULTURAL HIGH SCHOOL, 
The Petersham Agricultural High School, opened at Petersham, 
Mass., in 1906, is a new departure in secondary agricultural education 
in New England. In the high school four courses are offered: A 
college preparatory course, a course in agriculture, a course in manual 
training, and a course in domestic science. 
The course in agriculture includes instruction in— 
4. The wild flowers, birds, animals, and their habits. 
2. How to care for domestic animals, poultry, and bees. 
8. The noxious representatives of the insect world, harmful fungi, and the 
methods of destroying them. 
4. How to manage the dairy and culinary departments. 
5. The rocks, their chemical composition, and the process by which the earth 
has been changed from a molten mass to a fit home for man. 
6. The kinds of soil, their physical and chemical properties, the crops best 
suited to each, and the proper methods of improving, cultivating, and fertiliz- 
ing them. 
7. How to raise the best hay crop, and the culture of each of the standard 
crops grown on the farm. 
8. How to raise, care for, and market both the large and small fruits. 
9. How to conduct a market-garden business both in the open and under glass. 
10. The principles of forestry and landscape gardening. 
11. How to use the saw, plane, chisel, and to keep tools in good order. 
12. The cost, description, and practicability of the most modern machinery 
for each kind of farm work. 
18. The principles of rural architecture, road making, and village improve- 
ment, 
The instruction in agriculture is based on the sciences and correlated with 
them where it is practicable, without interfering with a systematic and pro- 
gressive course through the four years. The pupil’s time is not consumed in 
manual labor. His compulsory part in field and garden work is intended merely 
to supplement the discussions and experiments of the class room. While crops 
and fruit are not grown for the pecuniary return, they are in all cases managed 
so that the pupil may draw correct conclusions as to the practicability of those 
pursuits from a business standpoint.

MINNESOTA SYSTEM OF STATE-AIDED SCHOOLS. 
By an act approved April 19, 1909, the legislature of Minnesota 
provides that any state high school, graded, or consolidated rural 
school having satisfactory rooms and equipment may, upon applica- 
tion to the state high-school board, be designated to maintain an agri- 
cultural department. Each of such schools shall employ trained in- 
structors in agriculture, manual training, and domestic science, and 
have not less than 5 acres ‘of land. Instruction in the industrial 
department shall be free to all residents of the State. The depart- 
ment shall offer instruction in soils, crops, fertilizers, drainage, farm 
machinery, farm buildings, breeds of live stock, stock judging, animal 
diseases and remedies, production, testing, and hauling of milk and 
cream, manufacture of butter and cheese, growth of fruit, berries, 
management of orchards, market garden and vegetable crops, insects 
injurious to plants, diseases of plants, animal nutrition, including the 
use of forage crops, cereal grains, fine seeds, bookkeeping, farm ac- 
counts, and all other matters pertaining to general practice. Each of 
the schools shall receive state aid equal to two-thirds of the amount 
actually expended upon such department and vouched for, but in no 
case to exceed $2,500 per year. Not more than ten schools shall be 
aided the first year, nor more than ten added to the list every two 
years thereafter. No more than one school in any county shall be 
added to the list receiving aid in any two years. 
The act provides also that for the purpose of extending the teach- 
ing of agriculture, home economics, and manual training to pupils in 
rural schools, and for the purpose of extending the influence and su- 
pervision of state high or graded schools over rural schools, one or 
more rural schools may become associated with any state high or 
graded school maintaining a department of agriculture, which shall 
be designated as the central school. The act provides that rural 
school districts may levy a tax of not less than 1 mill nor more than 
4 mills for the maintenance of agricultural education in the rural 
schools, which shall be under the supervision and direction of the 
principal of the central school. 
TENNESSEE. 
An act of the legislature of Tennessee, approved April 27, 1909, 
authorizes the state board of education to employ an inspector of 
high schools, and requires the elements of agriculture and home eco- 
nomics to be taught in all county high schools. 
AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENTS IN VIRGINIA HIGH SCHOOLS. 
An act of the legislature of Virginia approved March 14, 1908, 
provides that so much of the sum of $575,000 appropriated for public
-P-A-G-E-161

schools and high schools as may be necessary, not to exceed $20,000, 
shall be devoted to the establishment of departments of agriculture, 
domestic economy, and manual training in at least one high school 
in each congressional district of the State, to be conducted under 
such rules and regulations as the state board of education and the 
president of the Virginia College of Agriculture and Poems 
Institute may prescribe. 
DAVENPORT (WASH.) HIGH SCHOOL, 
During the session of 1908-9 a beginning was made in agricultural 
instruction in the high school at Davenport, Wash. The plan has 
been in contemplation for several years, but did not reach its con- 
summation until the last school year. A four-year tentative course of 
studies is outlined as follows: 
First year: 
First semester, physical geography. 
Second semester, animal husbandry. 
Second year: 
First semester, botany. 
Second semester, soils. 
Third year: 
First semester, manual training and forge work. 
Second semester, manual training and forge work. 
Fourth year: 
First semester, fruit growing. 
Second semester, farm mechanics and farm economics. 
The course is given in the public high school, a part of the public- 
school system of the city of Davenport. 
  
Blackburn College, Carlinville, Ill., offers a course in the elements 
of agriculture. According to a published announcement, the work 
offered in 1908-9 is equivalent to that of the freshman year in any 
first-class agricultural college. The instruction is given by Mr. 
Orville M. Kiser, professor of physics, chemistry, and the elements 
of agriculture. 
The University of Florida inaugurated on November 1, 1908, a 
free correspondence course in agriculture for teachers. In June, 
1909, applicants for first and second grade teachers’ certificates will 
be required to pass examinations in agriculture. 
The Bussey Institution of Harvard University, which was opened 
in 1861 as a school for undergraduate instruction in agriculture, has 
been reorganized as a graduate school for advanced experimental 
work and research in those subjects of applied biology which relate 
to agriculture.

The University of Idaho has organized a four-year undergraduate 
course in forestry and is establishing a forestry station on a section 
of land located on Lake Coeur d’Alene, in Kootenai County, for 
demonstration purposes. 
A law of 1909 divided the State of Idaho into two educational dis- 
tricts and made provision for the establishment of a secondary agri- 
cultural school in each. 
With a record-breaking attendance of over 1,300, the farmers’ 
course, women’s course, and special dairy course at the college of agri- 
culture, University of Wisconsin, came to a successful close February 
19, again demonstrating that brief courses of practical instruction 
meet the demands and needs of the several classes for whom they are 
provided. The success of the special courses in home making and in 
the operation and management of creameries and cheese factories, 
both of which were given for the first time this year, was especially 
notable. 
Over 400 women, representing 29 counties of Wisconsin as well as 8 
other States, attended the lectures and demonstrations in cooking, 
nursing, and other subjects pertaining to home making. (University 
Bulletin, Feb. 22, 1909.)

The society held its second annual convention in Atlanta, Ga., 
November 19 to 21, 1908. One of the most important features of the 
meeting was the preliminary report of the committee of ten pre- 
viously appointed to consider the relation of industrial education to 
the general educational system of the country. This report was as 
follows: 
The committee appointed to consider the relation of industrial education to 
the general system of education of the country is composed of members living 
in widely separate parts of the country. Since the appointment of the commit- 
teé in the spring of 1908, it has been found practically impossible to prepare a 
final report. The following is therefore offered as a preliminary statement 
with regard to this matter. 
The need for industrial training and the facts concerning our own lack of it 
have been so often repeated that they may be accepted. All who are acquainted 
with education in European nations know that in the matter of industrial train- 
ing we are far behind such countries as Germany; that our apprentice system, 
even if materially extended, can offer industrial education to only a compara-
-P-A-G-E-163

tive few; that there are practically no facilities for the training of the youth 
between the ages of 14 and 18 for industrial pursuits, and the opportunities for 
those who are in the trades to improve their skill by theoretical training is con- 
fined to isolated and occasional schools. It is also perfectly clear that this is an 
industrial age, and that the education which is to serve for a whole people must 
take account of vocational training. 
Assuming these facts as clearly demonstrated, it is evident that two distinct 
groups of our population are to be considered: (1) Boys and girls between the 
ages of 14 and 18 who leave the grammar school and at present have no sys- 
tematic opportunity for training in the industries; (2) the men and women now 
in the industries who desire to increase their skill and efficiency by further 
study. The problem of industrial training seems, therefore, so far as the 
schools are concerned, to be divided into practically two parts, according as it 
applies to one or the other of these groups. 
I. THE INDUSTRIAL TRAINING OF YOUTHS. 
The vast majority of children leave school at the end of the grammar-school 
period, a number, in. fact, leaving the school before that time. Any vocational 
school which has to serve this great group of citizens must evidently fulfill the 
following conditions: 
(a) Such a school must articulate at some point with the public-school sys- 
tem of the country, preferably with the grammar school. In other words, the 
grammar school must at some point of its course lead a boy or a girl naturally 
into a vocational school, if such schools are to be fruitful to the great mass of 
youth. 
(b) If the grammar schools are to make this connection with vocational 
schools, it is clear that the grammar schools should at some part of their course 
do their part in developing the vocational purposes of the pupils on the basis of 
enlightenment concerning the advantages of skilled vocations, including the 
trades. It is clear, also, that every study should be so taught as to bring out 
its application to life, particularly to the skilled vocations, although those 
studies would not be so taught in the grammar school as to provide preparation 
for any particular trade. It is clear, too, that the grammar school should in- 
troduce elementary industrial training in some form, either in the form of 
manual training at the bench or at the forge or in household pursuits, wherever 
the training could be effectively given. Such an introduction of subjects for 
industrial training must come through the substitution of these subjects for 
something in the curriculum. The way to industrial education lies not in a 
more complex curriculum in existing schools, but in a larger variety of schools, 
each with a simpler programme and each seeking to do well the work it sets 
out to do. 
(c) Such schools as may articulate with the grammar school for the training 
of youths will therefore most likely assume the form of training schools for par- 
ticular industries. They will be local in their character and will seek to serve 
the needs of a local industry. The boy or girl trained in them will not be a 
skilled journeyman in any trade, but will have received a fundamental training 
in those things which will make him a skilled journeyman in a short time, and 
will at the same time prompt him to a higher form of vocational efficiency than 
he is likely to have had otherwise. In this respect the industrial training school 
for youth is likely to have much the same relation to the preparation of a skilled 
journeyman as the high-grade engineering school has to the preparation of a 
practical engineer.

  152 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
I. SCHOOLS FOR THOSE ALREADY IN THE INDUSTRIES. 
Experience would seem to indicate that the schools which seek to serve those 
already in the industries will assume one of two forms: 
(a) Industrial improvement schools. 
(6) Trade schools. 
The industrial improvement school has so far, as it is likely to do in the 
future, assumed the form of an evening school in which are taught the funda- 
mental sciences upon which a trade rests, together with such technical informa- 
tion as can be given in a physical, chemical, or mechanical laboratory. For 
example, those who are engaged in the power station of an electric railroad, as 
motormen, as electricians, or as linemen, may in such a school learn the funda- 
mental theory of electricity, the methods of insulation, of electrical measure- 
ment, and of the transformation of energy. All of these principles may be 
illustrated before their eyes in the electrical laboratory, and they may thus 
acquire a foundation of knowledge which will enable them to become in time 
foremen, managers, or perhaps inventors. Such a school appeals only to the 
men of more than usual ambition and energy. 
The pure trade school, on the other hand, undertakes to teach not alone the 
fundamental processes of a trade, but its technique. It therefore lays chief 
emphasis upon giving to its students such continuous practice as may bring 
them up to the point of expertness. It seeks to reproduce as nearly as possible 
the conditions of actual practice. 
GENERAL CONCLUSIONS. 
It seems clear to your committee that schools of all the types which have been 
mentioned here, both for youths and for adults, are likely to be attempted, and 
in fact are being attempted in the various parts of the United States. The 
committee believes that all these types of schools are to be welcomed as experi- 
ments in the general problem which we are seeking to solve. Success in indus- 
trial training does not depend upon the adoption of one type of school. A 
measure of success is likely to be achieved by all of these efforts, and in the 
judgment of your committee it is wise for those who have to do with industrial 
education to welcome during the next decade of experimentation all these forms 
of industrial education, whether they be in the form of a trade school for boys, 
an industrial improvement school for boys and adults, or a trade school for 
the workers of a trade. Ultimately all these efforts will, by the force of educa- 
tional gravitation, relate themselves to the public-school system of the country, 
partly by the adaptation of the public-school system itself, partly by the adapta- 
tion of these industrial schools. No series of schools can finally survive which 
does not so relate itself to the public-school education, since the source from 
which pupils are to be drawn must in the long run be the public schools. The 
committee therefore feels that any of these efforts, undertaken in an intelligent, 
sympathetic, and proper spirit, is to be welcomed as a new contribution to the 
general problem of industrial education in the United States. 
The officers of the society for 1909 are Alexander C. Humphreys, 
president; Walter C. Kerr, vice-president; Frederick B. Pratt, 
treasurer; James C. Monaghan, 546 Fifth avenue, New York City, 
secretary. 
The next annual convention will be held at Milwaukee, December 
1-8, 1909.

INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 153 
REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION OF THE 
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MANUFACTURERS. 
The National Association of Manufacturers held its thirteenth 
annual convention at New York City in May, 1908, on which occa- 
sion its committee on industrial education, Anthony Ittner, chair- 
man, made an extended report dealing with various phases of the 
subject, which report was duly adopted. The committee noted with 
satisfaction that at no time had the progress of industrial education 
been so marked as during the twelve months that had intervened 
since making its last report. The committee, the report states, was 
originally brought into being to remedy the conditions prevailing 
at the time of its first appointment, conditions “the result of which 
was that in some localities a father was not even permitted to teach 
his own son a trade and calling in which he himself was engaged.” 
The very positive attitude of the committee in favor of trade schools 
that will turn out finished journeymen mechanics may be seen from 
its “ conclusions,” which run as follows: 
And now, in bringing this report to a close, we want still further to empha- 
size what we have iterated and reiterated in our former reports—that it is 
genuine, practical industrial education that we stand for, an industrial educa- 
tion which will make of the American boy an all-around, full-fledged, skilled 
mechanic, able to take his place and hold his own alongside of the skilled 
mechanic having learned his trade in the skilled industries of this or any other 
country, and to this contention let us dogmatically adhere. * * * 
And while we can see the advantages that a trade-school training would 
be to a young man who is serving an apprenticeship in some of the industries, 
or to a journeyman who was working at his trade and receiving full journey- 
man’s wages and who might desire to make of himself a more expert and 
finished workman, we should nevertheless oppose with all our might granting 
trade-school privileges to such, until every young man who was not serving 
an apprenticeship or working at his trade as a journeyman had been provided 
for. * * * The argument that a finished, skilled workman can not be grad- 
uated from a trade school must be combated with the utmost persistency, as 
also the admission into night trade schools of young men serving apprentice- 
ships and journeymen working at their trades, until every young man applying 
for admission had been provided for. Should it then appear that there were 
vacancies, there should be no objection to admitting apprentices and journey- 
men mechanics into night trade schools. 
Similar views are expressed in the report of the same committee 
made at the fourteenth meeting of the association, held in New York 
City, May 17-19, 1909, and regret is expressed that such organiza- 
tions as the National Society for the Promotion of Industrial Educa- 
tion and the Massachusetts State Commission have not taken a more 
definite and determined stand in favor of complete trade schools. 
On the other hand, the committee highly commends the action of 
the National Education Association, which has cordially indorsed 
(1908) the establishment of public trade and industrial schools of 
   
-P-A-G-E-166
  154 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
such a character that “the graduates of these schools may at once 
become advanced apprentices or journeymen.” 
INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION FROM THE VIEW POINT OF ORGANIZED 
LABOR. 
The American Federation of Labor, at its twenty-ninth annual 
convention, held at Denver November 9-21, 1908, adopted the follow- 
ing resolution: 
Whereas industrial education is necessary and inevitable for the progress of 
an industrial people; and 
Whereas there are two groups with opposite methods, and seeking antagon- 
istic ends, now advocating industrial education in the United States; and 
Whereas one of these groups is largely composed of the nonunion employers 
of the country who advance industrial education as a special privilege under 
conditions that educate the student or apprentice to nonunion sympathies and 
prepare him as a skilled worker for scab labor and strike-breaking purposes, 
thus using the children of the workers against the interests of their organized 
fathers and brothers in the various crafts; and 
Whereas this group also favors the training of the student or apprentice for 
skill in only one industrial process, thus making the graduate a skilled worker 
in only a very limited sense and rendering him entirely helpless if lack of em- 
ployment comes in his single subdivision of a craft; and 
Whereas the other group is composed of great educators, enlightened repre- 
sentatives of organized labor, and persons engaged in genuine social service, 
who advocate industrial education as a common right to be open to all children 
on equal terms to be provided by general taxation and kept under the control 
of the whole people with a method or system of education that will make the 
apprentice or graduate a skilled craftsman in all the branches of his trade; 
and 
Whereas organized labor has the largest personal and the highest public 
interest in the subject of industrial education, and should enlist its ablest and 
best men in behalf of the best system, under conditions that will promote the 
interests of the workers and the general welfare: Now, therefore be it 
Resolved, That the president, in conjunction with the executive council of the 
American Federation of Labor, be, and is hereby, authorized to appoint a special 
committee of at least fifteen, to be composed of a majority of trade union 
members of this convention, who will serve without compensation and incur 
no expenses other than necessary and legitimate expenditure within the judg- 
ment of the president and executive council, to investigate the methods and 
means of industrial education in this country and abroad, and to report its 
findings, conclusions, and recommendations to the next annual meeting of the 
American Federation of Labor. 
The committee, as subsequently appointed, includes Charles P. 
Neill, United States Commissioner of Labor; Representative W. B. 
Wilson; Rev. Charles Stelzle, superintendent of the department of 
labor of the Presbyterian Church; Charles H. Winslow, former 
commissioner of industrial education, of Massachusetts; Mrs. Ray- 
mond Robins, president of the National Woman’s Trade Union 
League; James Duncan, vice-president of the American Federation 
of Labor; John B. Lennon, treasurer of the American Federation of
-P-A-G-E-167
    
INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 155 
Labor; Frank Duffy, secretary of the United Brotherhood of Car- 
penters; Agnes Nestor, John Golden, James Wilson, Edward Hirsch, 
James Roach, Hugh Frayne, D. J. Conlon, Stewart Reid, and John 
Mitchell, chairman. 
The committee held a meeting in New York City August 20, 1909, 
preliminary to a general meeting which will be held in Washington 
October 19. . 
Regarding the work of this committee, the chairman, Mr. John 
Mitchell, is quoted by the Literary Digest as stating in his report that: 
The committee has gone into the subject exhaustively, and finds that many 
manufacturers, because of the specialization of the different departments of the 
trades, find it very hard to get competent superintendents owing to the difficulty 
of finding all-around mechanics who have learned everything about any par- 
ticular trade. 
Further on he goes on to say: 
The high schools, for instance, teach pupils how to prepare for the professions, 
but as there are more people in mechanical trades than in the professions, they 
should also, we believe, teach the principles of mechanics. 
A man, for instance, may know that a joint at a certain angle is stronger than 
at any other angle, without knowing the reason why. Another man will know 
why that joint is stronger. This man will be more valuable than the first man. 
Ambition to excel would be stimulated if mechanics had a better opportunity of 
knowing the principles of a trade, as well as learning one branch of a trade in 
a routine way. In the end this would be better for both employers and 
employees. 
A number of recommendations on the subject will be made at the coming 
meeting of the committee in Washington, which will be submitted at the next 
meeting of the American Federation of Labor for approval before we ask for 
legislation on the subject. 
The attitude of organized labor toward industrial education has 
been also set forth in an address by Mr. John Golden, general presi- 
dent of the United Textile Workers of America, delivered before 
the American Institute of Instruction, July, 1909. In the course of 
his remarks he said: 
Organized labor, however, is strongly opposed to some forms of industrial 
education, namely, that represented by the “trade school,” that guarantees 
to turn out a young man in a few months’ time as a full-fledged tradesman. 
The results of such schools have been to flood the labor market with “ half- 
baked ” journeymen, to put a premium on securing the job, instead of a pre- 
mium on the skill necessary to do the job; and, what is worse still, these 
kinds of schools have on some occasions supplied strike breakers when union 
men have been endeavoring to secure that which they felt they were justly 
entitled to. And let me ask you, why should not the union craftsman jealously 
guard the only asset he has in the world against those who would not hesitate 
a moment to depreciate its value? It is the only means he has to maintain his 
home and provide for those dependent upon him. If he is somewhat slow in 
taking up with these new movements, it is because of what he has endured in 
the past, and because of the fact that he wants to make sure that those whom 
he loves are not going to suffer, 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
    
156 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
Organized labor realizes just as keenly as anybody else that this movement 
in the interest of industrial education is not a fad, but a stern reality and an 
absolute necessity. If this country is to preserve and maintain its industrial 
supremacy, men and women in all walks of life, irrespective of their station, 
must join hands together in one united effort. * * “* TI believe the question 
as to the need of such education has passed beyond the debating stage; what 
is now needed more than anything else is for all classes to get together and 
cooperate in this great movement, which is not a question of capital and labor 
any more than it is a subject to exploit our fads and fancies. I believe we 
should get right hold of the boy at 14, when his mind is becoming impression- 
able, when he is just beginning to feel his wants to do something tangible; 
teach him the why and the wherefore of certain things and the very best way 
to do them. 
DIVISION OF TRADE SCHOOLS OF NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT 
OF EDUCATION. 
The New York State department of education has organized a 
division of trades schools, with Mr. Arthur D. Dean as chief of the 
division, and is prepared to take up the organization of factory and 
trades schools with local school authorities, commercial or labor 
organizations, or any other citizens who may be interested. 
INAUGURATION OF PUBLIC VOCATIONAL TRAINING IN NEW YORK 
CITY. 
On September 13, 1909, will be opened in New York the first public 
vocational or industrial school established in conformity with the 
recommendation of the city school board committee on trade schools. 
Charles J. Pickett, Ph. D., has been appointed principal of the 
school, which will be known as “ Public School 100.” There will be 
25 men teachers, chosen on account of their mechanical skill, among 
other qualifications. - Regarding the general character of the school, 
the New York Tribune said (Aug. 30), in the course of an extended 
article upon the subject: 
Various equipments of the best quality and design are rapidly being installed 
in the handsome new building for the use of those boys who enter the course. 
In wood the pupils will learn carpentry, joinery, wood turning, pattern making, 
and the manipulation of milling machinery. In metal they will have forge 
work, sheet-metal work, and a complete line of machine-shop work. There will 
also be courses in plumbing, printing, architectural and mechanical drafting, 
including the making of plans and the drawing up of specifications and blue- 
prints. 
The nonvocational subjects that will occupy less than one-fourth of the stu- 
dent’s time will include trade mathematics, elementary bookkeeping, industrial 
history, civics, industrial and commercial geography, and English. ‘“ Every 
topic that is introduced,” said Doctor Pickett, ‘will be tested in terms of its 
efficiency as a correlative of the vocational subjects.” The hours will be from 
9 a.m.to5 p.m. The atmosphere of the school will be the atmosphere of the 
shops.” The boys are to be led to feel that they are working in an environment
-P-A-G-E-169
  
  INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 157 
closely approximating that of a well-conducted shop. This will mean a radical 
breaking away from ordinary school methods and conditions. 
The instruction will be mainly individual; “ mass work” will have no place 
in this new venture, and no pupil will be compelled to. mark time, it is said, 
because of the inability of his fellows to keep pace with him. Doctor Pickett 
described the difference between the aim of the manual-training schools and the 
new vocational school as follows: 
“The manual training is not to give a boy mastery of tools; it is simply an 
added appeal in the line of general culture. The vocational teaching idea aims 
specifically to give mastery of tools.” | 
The object of the school, according to Superintendent Maxwell, as 
set forth in his tenth annual report (p. 126), is this: 
The board of education does not propose to turn out “half-baked” journey- 
men to compete with union labor. What it proposes to do is to fit boys and 
girls more completely than they are fitted at present to commence learning any 
trade requiring skill of hand. 
Two things necessary for success seem to him to be: (1) The em- 
ployment of skilled workmen in our manual training and industrial 
processes. The boy gains respect for hand labor only when he has a 
master workman to imitate. (2) Some means must be found to 
secure the active participation of manufacturers and trades unions in 
our industrial work. 
The latter is to be accomplished through the organization of com- 
mittees to advise the educational authorities, and through a provision 
by which boys and girls between 14 and 16 at work might spend part 
of their working day in school. 
Doctor Pickett also says: 
I don’t plan to turn out boys who are going to take journeymen jobs. 
CONSOLIDATION OF INDUSTRIAL AND GENERAL EDUCATION IN 
MASSACHUSETTS. 
According to the terms of a Massachusetts act of 1909, the state board 
of education and the state commission on industrial education have 
been consolidated. The new state board of education so formed, con- 
sisting of nine members, is to exercise all the powers formerly con- 
ferred on both bodies. Prof. Paul H. Hanus, of Harvard, chairman 
of the commission on industrial education from 1906 to 1909, has 
been nominated a member of the new board. In addition to appoint- 
ing a state commissioner of education, the board is to appoint two 
deputy commissioners, “ one of whom shall be especially qualified to 
deal with industrial education.” 
HIGH SCHOOL INDUSTRIAL COURSES IN CHICOPEE AND FITCHBURG, 
MASS. 
The city of Chicopee has recently inaugurated a noteworthy ex- 
periment in the field of public industrial education, which is thus
-P-A-G-E-170
  158 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
described by Mr. Julius E. Warren, agent of the state board of 
education : 
The Chicopee high school in the morning session gives to those who choose to 
take the industrial work special courses in mathematics, drawing, science, 
English, history, the study of materials used, processes of manufacture, trans- 
portation, and the economic, civic, and social questions involved in production. 
In the afternoon these pupils work in a well-equipped shop connected with the 
high-school building. Provision has been made for: the teaching of pattern 
making, woodworking, molding, and the machinist’s trade. The girls have 
excellent courses in the domestic arts, AJl of the instruction is given by skilled 
mechanics or highly trained teachers. 
Another city of Massachusetts, Fitchburg, has adopted for its 
high-school pupils the system of cooperative instruction described 
elsewhere in this chapter. 
MANUAL ARTS SCHOOL IN FITCHBURG, MASS. 
Supt. Joseph G. Edgerly, of Fitchburg, Mass., informs the Com- 
missioner of Education, September 20, 1909, that a manual arts 
school has been opened in that city on what appears to be a unique 
plan. The State made an appropriation for a building for the 
school, which building is to be a part of the state normal school plant. 
The city will maintain the school, which is now being conducted in 
temporary quarters. Pupils from grades 7 and 8 are admitted to the 
school from any part of the city; they will accordingly have an 
opportunity to pursue the course of the school, while the students 
at the state normal school will have opportunity to learn how to teach 
the various branches of the course. The building is in process of 
erection and will probably be completed in December. Much is 
expected of this movement. 
INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION IN NEW BEDFORD, 
A system of free evening industrial courses was conducted in New 
Bedford, Mass., during the school year 1908-9, under the authority 
of the city school board. Courses were given in electricity, steam, 
mathematics, domestic economy, chemistry, gas engines, etc. An 
advisory board included a number of citizens connected with the 
local industries. These courses were designed for persons already 
engaged in some form of occupation, no pupils connected with the 
elementary or high schools being as a rule admitted. The sessions 
extended from 7.30 to 9.30 p. m., and any number of courses might 
be taken by a pupil, provided they did not come on the same night. 
The number of students in the various courses was 237. 
In October, 1908, the New Bedford city council passed an order 
establishing an independent industrial school. Charles R. Allen 
was elected principal, at a salary of $3,000. Active work was expected 
to begin in the ensuing September.

NEW INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL AT SPRINGFIELD, MASS. 
A new industrial or vocational public school was started in Spring- 
field, Mass., in September, 1909, inaugurating a new era in education 
in that city. The vocational work will be begun in two centers, and 
preparations are being made for about 60 boys, 30 in each place. 
Boys from 14 years of age and upward, those who have completed 
the work of the seventh and eighth grades, and who but for the in- 
stitution of the vocational school would drop their education for 
good, will attend the school. All of the work done at the school will 
be book work, these sessions coming from 9 to 12 o’clock in the morn- 
ing. In the afternoon the same classes will take their shopwork 
from 2 to 5 o’clock. There will be shopwork also Saturday morn- 
ings. The book work will center largely about the shops, having 
to do with the economic and industrial conditions of the country, 
descriptions of the machinery used, etc. The local vocational school 
will not fit boys for finished trade workmen, as they will have to 
serve apprenticeships in factories after attending the school. Each 
boy with the help of the instructors will try to discover which work 
he is best fitted for, wood or iron. (Abridged from the Springfield 
Republican.) 
THE MILWAUKEE SCHOOL OF TRADES—THE WISCONSIN LAW. 
The Milwaukee School of Trades, opened in January, 1906, under 
the auspices of the Merchants and Manufacturers’ Association, was 
incorporated into the public-school system in 1907. The school is in 
operation fifty-two weeks in the year and forty-four hours a week. 
Day courses are given in pattern making, machinist’s and tool-making 
trade, and carpentry and woodworking (two years), and plumbing 
and gas fitting (one year). Night classes are in session two hours 
four evenings a week during seven months of the year. Each pupil 
makes a study of a single trade. Tuition is free te pupils from 16 to 
20 years of age who can read and write and have a knowledge of the 
elements of arithmetic. Graduates of the eighth grade are preferred. 
The instruction in each trade comes under five heads: (1) Shop prac- 
tice and trade lectures; (2) mechanical and free-hand working draw- 
ing; (3) workshop mathematics; (4) lectures and illustrated talks 
on subjects pertaining to the trade; (5) shop-inspection trips. About 
three-fourths of the student’s time is devoted to the actual shop prac- 
tice coming under the first of the above heads. Each boy is a class 
by himself, and may finish his course in less than the prescribed time. 
The school does not claim to turn out journeymen mechanics. Its 
aim is to instruct its students thoroughly, in as short a time as possible, 
in all the fundamental principles and in the practice of the trade in

  160 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
question, so that they may upon graduation possess ability and con- 
fidence and be of immediate practical value to their employers and 
receive a fair remuneration at once. 
The most urgent problem, according to Mr, Charles F. Perry, the 
director of the Milwaukee school, is what to do with the boy between 
graduation from the grammar school and his admission to the trade 
school. He suggests the introduction into the high schools of trade- 
school preparatory courses. 
The Wisconsin trade-school law took effect July 1, 1907. It author- 
ized any city to establish, as a part of the public-school system, a 
school or schools for the purpose of giving practical instruction in 
the useful trades to persons of 16 years and upward. Such a school 
is not to be maintained, however, unless there is an average enroll- 
ment of at least 30. In 1909 the law was amended to include trade 
schools for girls, and the age limit for admission was lowered to 14 
years. 
State Superintendent C. P. Cary states, July, 1909, that “ no other 
city besides Milwaukee has made provision for the establishment of 
trade schools.” 
TRADE EDUCATION IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS OF MENOMONIE, WIS. 
Boys in the last two years of the Menomonie high schools are per- 
mitted to take work in a particular trade in place of the regular 
manual-training course. This has proved an incentive to boys to 
continue their education through the high school, as in the last two 
years all but two of the boys graduating from the eighth grade 
entered the high school. Supt. George A. Works, of the Menomonie 
schools, writes (July 31, 1909) that the work is still being continued: 
The trades offered at present are machine shop, drafting, plumbing, and brick- 
laying. The last two named have been in progress only a year, so not much 
can be said with reference to them. In fact, all the trade work has been in 
operation such a short space of time that it is somewhat early to draw infer- 
ences that may be considered final. I am of the opinion that the earning 
capacity of our students leaving school has been increased by this work. 
NEW JERSEY COMMISSION ON INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION. 
Pursuant to a joint resolution of the senate and general assembly 
of New Jersey approved April 14, 1908, the governor of the State 
appointed the following commission on industrial education: George 
R. Howe, president; William A. Bembridge, John W. Ferguson, 
F. W. Roebling, jr., and George G. Tennant. The commission was 
organized June 2, 1908, and its report was submitted to the legislature 
in January, 1909. The report as printed contains 177 pages, and is 
an excellent survey of industrial educational work in the country.

  INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 161 
The commission summarizes the results of its investigations as 
follows: 
(1) As the direct outcome of modern industrial conditions—factory organiza- 
tion, the introduction of machinery, and “ piecework ”’—the apprenticeship sys- 
tem has been virtually abandoned as a means of instructing the young in the 
various trades. 
(2) There is a lack of skilled and efficient workmen, and this will be largely 
increased unless a better means of vocational training is found. 
(8) Although the compulsory-attendance period in the public schools has been 
extended gradually in New Jersey, as elsewhere in the United States, the schools 
have not been able to offer vocational training. Fully 95 per cent of the pupils 
leave school between the ages of 14 and 17, and without having formed any 
idea as to what trade or vocation they should follow. In consequence they drift 
into occupations, rather than select those which might be most nearly suited 
to their aptitudes, and their progress is generally arrested at an early age be- 
cause of the restricted character of their experience and the failure to receive 
supplementary instruction. 
(4) The trades have become so specialized that there is but little chance for 
a learner to go beyond the narrow limits of the work to which he is assigned 
unless he has supplementary training. 
(5) The workers, mechanics, or craftsmen in the several trades are deeply 
sensible of their lack of opportunities for vocational training during the early 
years, and grown men among them would gladly take advantage of industrial 
schools if these institutions were established. 
(6) Although business conditions are such that the employers, in most in- 
stances, have neither the time nor the inclination to conduct vocational schools 
within the factories, they would gladly welcome any suitable means of providing 
the workers with the instruction which the latter require. 
(7) There is an urgent demand for facilities for industrial education to 
supplement the training of the shops. 
The following recommendations were made: 
(1) That manual training should be encouraged, especially through the 
compulsory-attendance period. 
(2) That vocational instruction should be provided for those who have com- 
pleted the compulsory-attendance period and who plan to enter some industrial 
pursuit at a later time. 
(8) That evening industrial schools should be established for those who leave 
the ordinary school early in life to go to work. 
(4) That a permanent state commission should be established to exercise 
control over industrial education through local boards of trustees appointed 
independently of the present boards of education, these boards to have full 
charge and control of the local industrial schools, subject only to the supervision 
of the state commission. 
STATE AID TO MANUAL TRAINING IN VERMONT. 
An act of the legislature of Vermont approved January 27, 1909, 
provides for the payment of $250 per year to any town, city, or dis- 
trict maintaining a manual training department in a high or gram- 
mar school whose course of study in manual training has been ap-

proved by the state superintendent of education. The amount to be 
expended under the act shall not exceed $5,000 in any one year. 
THE CLEVELAND TECHNICAL HIGH SCHOOL. 
The Cleveland Technical High School, Cleveland, Ohio, was 
opened for instruction in the fall of 1908, and is intended to be a 
finishing school whose graduates will leave school prepared to enter 
a vocation. It offers a course of study for boys and a course for 
girls. The school year is divided into four quarters of twelve weeks 
each, and may be completed in either three or four years at the option 
of the pupils. During the last two years of the course pupils will be 
allowed to specialize along lines to which they are particularly 
adapted, in order that upon graduation they may be better fitted for 
their life work. The department for girls has domestic science 
and domestic and industrial art for its basis. The school offers trade 
courses during the evening to men and women already engaged in a 
given trade. The trade instruction offered to men in the evening in- 
cludes carpentry, cabinet making, pattern making, foundry practice, 
tool forging, sheet metal and machine shop practice, architectural and 
mechanical drawing, free-hand drawing, charcoal and water-color 
rendering, clay modeling, bookbinding, leather work, art metal work 
and design as applied to the crafts. For women there will be courses 
in plain hand sewing, dress cutting and fitting, machine sewing, 
spring and fall millinery, plain cooking, etc. A new three story and 
basement building has been erected, for the construction of which 
bonds to the amount of $350,000 were issued. 
Respecting the enrollment in this school, Superintendent Elson 
says that— 
while it enrolls something like 600 students, more than 500 of these were largely 
from waste product, that is to say, they are pupils who would not have gone 
to high school had not this school been opened to them. 
THE SECONDARY INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL OF COLUMBUS, GA. 
This school, which forms a part of the public-school system of Co- 
lumbus, possesses some notable features. It may be described as an 
academic trade and commercial high school, in which, besides the 
usual branches of a high-school education (omitting foreign lan- 
guages, however), are taught a number of trades having reference to 
the dominant local industries. The session of this school continues 
throughout the year, except the month of August. The hours of the 
school are the ordinary working hours, from 8 to 4, with thirty min- 
utes’ intermission, for six days in the week, the traditional Saturday 
holiday being eliminated. Besides the academic work, the boys are 
taught carpentry, pattern making, machinist’s trade, cotton-mill
-P-A-G-E-175
  
INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 163 
work, and business pursuits; the girls, millinery, dressmaking, etc. 
Each of these courses extends over three full years, and requires from 
twenty-four to thirty hours a week in addition to academic work. 
The pupil on entering must be 14 years of age and have had an ele- 
mentary school education, and is required to select then the trade to 
which he is to devote himself throughout the course. 
The frequent change from academic studies to practical shopwork 
and other exercises relieves the strain upon the mind, so that the long 
school hours and almost uninterrupted session are said not to be 
prejudicial to the health of the pupils; rather, the pleasing variety of 
occupation holds their interest and leads to a wholesome and sympa- 
thetic activity. 
Mr. C. B. Gibson, city school superintendent, makes the following 
statement regarding this school under date of July 10, 1909: 
In the preparation of students for intelligent and efficient service in industrial 
pursuits the school is successfully fulfilling its purpose. So far I have not been 
able to discover any but the friendliest attitude toward the school on the part of 
Jabor unions. 
The increase in enrollment of students is not as rapid as I had hoped it would 
be, due almost entirely to its departure from the long-established and widely 
prevailing custom of short hours and long vacations. To educate the public 
upon the importance of economizing in time in the life of a youth, especially 
when other local schools maintain the traditional hours and annual sessions, 
will be a slow process. 
THE DAVID RANKEN JUNIOR SCHOOL OF MECHANICAL TRADES, 
ST. LOUIS. 
The David Ranken Junior School of Mechanical Trades is an en- 
dowed institution, founded by Mr. David Ranken, jr., of St. Louis, 
to be opened in September, 1909. According to a preliminary an- 
nouncement, the design of the school is to train and fit boys and men 
for the mechanical or manual trades and occupations. 
Mr. Ranken stipulates that the instruction to be given must always 
be practical— 
having in mind the need of the community and the State for practical workers 
in mechanical trades who shall be skilled in their respective trades and occu- 
pations and have such education as will best fit them to serve the community 
and the State in such occupations. 
Classes will be held both day and evening. For the first year, and 
perhaps longer, the instruction offered in the day classes will be 
limited to four trades: Carpentry, bricklaying, plumbing, and paint- 
ing. In all cases the instructors will be men’of practical experience 
and skill in their trades, fully competent to teach the best modern 
methods and theory. The scheme of operation provides for extensive 
practice in the manual and mechanical operations involved in the 
   
-P-A-G-E-176
  164 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
trades offered, and, in addition thereto, instruction in drawing, mathe- 
matics, elementary science, and building theory. 
The regular course will be open to men and boys of 16 or over who 
have completed the work of the seventh grade in the public schools, 
or its equivalent. Applicants who have had experience in a trade 
may be admitted with less schooling. No set time can be given for 
the completion of any one of the courses offered. The average stu- 
dent should be able to complete the work offered in any of the given 
trades in two years. The school year will run from September to 
August. Classes will be in session from 8 to 5 o'clock, from Monday 
to Friday, inclusive, and from 8 to 12 on Saturday. 
The present building, the first of a group, is three stories high, 
contains five shops, a drafting room, an assembly hall, a science 
room, a library, class rooms, and offices, and will be fully equipped 
with the best modern tools and appliances necessary for thorough 
instruction in the trades. 
Mr. Lewis Gustafson has been chosen for superintendent. 
ELEMENTARY INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL AT CLEVELAND, OHIO. 
The board of education of Cleveland, Ohio, has authorized the 
establishment, at the Brownell Annex, of an elementary industrial 
school for boys and girls who are more than 13 years old and not 
below the sixth grade. The course extends through two years and 
consists of two types of work, namely, (a) academic, (6) industrial, 
the time being equally divided between the two. The academic 
studies comprise English, arithmetic, and geography-history. The 
English includes spelling, writing, reading, literature, composition; 
the arithmetic includes accounts and shop problems; the geography- 
history deals with the industrial, commercial, and political phases 
of the subject, and will include civics and municipal studies. 
On the industrial side the work will include, for boys, bench work 
in wood and sheet metal, free-hand drawing and design, mechanical 
drawing; for girls, sewing and garment making, cooking, and house- 
hold arts, free-hand drawing, design, and construction. Throughout 
the work will be intensely practical. 
The day consists of nine periods, one of which is devoted to 
luncheon. The school accommodates 80 boys and 80 girls. It is 
intended for boys and girls to whom the regular course is unduly 
literary and who are not especially interested in bookish things. It 
is also of interest to those whose economic condition requires them 
to leave school early to, become wage-earners. 
An auditorium, gymnasium, shower bath, and swimming pool are 
available for the use of this special school. It is open to available 
pupils from all parts of the city. Each school building may name 
eligible boys and girls, naming a first choice and an alternate. If
-P-A-G-E-177
  
  INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 165 
possible, when a delegate named is a boy, or boys, the alternate should 
be a girl, or girls, and when the delegates are girls the alternates 
should be boys. 
WINONA TECHNICAL INSTITUTE, INDIANAPOLIS. 
The Winona Technical Institute, Indianapolis, Ind., is a group of 
trade schools. It was opened in 1904 with courses in pharmacy- 
chemistry and electrical wiring, but courses in the additional sub- 
jects of lithography, printing, tile and mantel setting, bricklaying, 
and foundry work are now offered. These courses vary in length 
from a few months to two years, depending upon the trade learned. 
Literary instruction is subordinate to practical mechanical work. 
The history of industry, chemistry, and other subjects kindred to the 
chosen trade of the apprentice are studied. 
The school of lithography, the only one of its kind in the country, 
offers practical work in every branch of the trade. The chemistry 
of the subject is taught. Thus pupils are trained not only to pro- 
duce the effect but to know the cause. Similarly, instruction in the 
other trades is made comprehensive. 
Recently, by an agreement between the institute and the Inter- 
national Stewards’ Association, a hotel employees’ training school 
has been planned. The Stewards’ Association will build a hotel on 
the ground capable of accommodating 400 students, and practical 
instruction in hotel work will be given. 
Tuition rates are reasonable. A number of scholarships are offered, 
so that the way to a remunerative trade is made comparatively easy 
for the deserving, energetic boy. 
THE WILLIAMSON FREE SCHOOL OF MECHANICAL TRADES. 
The Williamson school is a private endowed school, turning out 
skilled mechanics. Since 1891 it has graduated 726 pupils, as follows: 
One hundred and seventy bricklayers, 150 carpenters, 69 stationary 
engineers, 198 machinists, and 139 pattern makers. Its property 
consists of 24 buildings, located on 230 acres of ground, near 
Philadelphia. 
No pupils are received who are under 16 or over 18 years of age. 
The number of candidates for admission largely exceeds the capacity 
of the school. Candidates are required to pass scholastic, moral, and 
physical entrance examinations. The scholastic examination is in 
the common school branches. Candidates who prove satisfactory 
after a preliminary trial are indentured for a term of three years. 
Each apprentice takes but one of the five trades above mentioned. 
None are admitted but young men who intend following for a liveli- 
hood the trades taught them. 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
  166 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
The institution is open all the year, but regular exercises are sus- 
pended in August. The school is in session eight hours daily on five 
days of the week, and three hours on Saturday, each apprentice 
spending about one-half of the time in the shops during the first 
year, the proportion increasing until the last few months of the 
senior year, when shopwork occupies the entire day. 
The branches taught in the academic department are reading, writ- 
ing, grammar, arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, physical 
and political geography, United States history, English literature, 
physical science, physiology and hygiene, civil government, chemis- 
try, elementary vocal music, theory of the steam engine, strength of 
materials, building construction, mechanical and free-hand drawing, 
and estimating. 
The school was founded in the belief that if intelligent young men 
are given carefully graded and comprehensive exercises in trade work 
in properly equipped school shops by competent teachers who are 
high-grade mechanics, with suitable accompanying academic instruc- 
tion (especially in mathematics and mechanical drawing) and a 
course of sufficient length, they will surely become skilled workmen. 
How far this belief has been justified by the results is shown in the 
following statement recently made to the bureau by Mr. John M. 
Shrigley, the president of the school: 
The experience of the Williamson Free School of Mechanical Trades, cover- 
ing a period of nearly eighteen years, and the graduation of a large number of 
mechanics in the trades of bricklaying, carpentering, stationary engineering, 
machine work, and pattern making, has clearly shown the practicability of its 
methods. The large demand for its graduates year after year by the leading 
employers of the country shows unmistakably the thoroughness of the mechan- 
ical instruction given at the school, as well as the favorable results of the collat- 
eral academic courses, and the foundation laid for good citizenship. They are 
employed immediately on graduation as journeymen at journeymen’s wages, 
and have proven themselves to be skillful and intelligent workmen and already 
many of them have attained to positions of important mechanical respensi- 
bility. They make notably good foremen, and there has arisen a considerable 
demand for them as teachers of trade work in their lines. 
Ninety-five per cent of the graduates are said to enter at once on 
trade work at wages of 60 to 100 per cent of full journeyman’s pay. 
LUDLOW (MASS.) TEXTILE SCHOOL. 
At the Ludlow Textile School, Ludlow, Mass., which was estab- 
lished and is maintained by the Ludlow Manufacturing Associates, 
there is very close and intimate relationship between the school and 
the mills. Admission to the school is limited to the most intelligent 
boys between 14 and 16 years of age. They spend five hours each 
day in the mills and three hours each day in the school, receiving 
payment as if they worked the full eight hours in the mills. Each
-P-A-G-E-179
    
INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 167 
apprentice spends from three to six months in each department of the 
mills and his work varies but little from that of the regular mill 
workers. The course of study in the school extends through four 
years and includes arithmetic, algebra, geometry, English, geography, 
history, drawing, and mechanics. There is a vacation of one month 
in August. 
COOPERATIVE INDUSTRIAL COURSES. 
What promises to be one of the most significant movements in in- 
dustrial education in recent years is the establishment of cooperative 
courses, consisting of a combination of instruction in school and prac- 
tical shopwork in a factory. By an agreement between the school 
authorities and the manufacturer, the student is enabled to divide his 
time between technical class-room instruction and practical training 
as an apprentice. Following is a somewhate detailed account of the 
work of certain institutions that offer such courses: 
THE UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI, CINCINNATI, OHO. 
The cooperative courses of the University of Cincinnati are de- 
signed for students in engineering, but no cooperative course in civil 
engineering is given. By a contract signed by the student, the 
university, and the firm, the student enters upon a period of study 
and shopwork for six years. A class is divided into two sections; 
these sections alternate with each other, each one working one week in 
the factory and studying the next week in the university. During 
the summer full-time work is done in the shops, but several weeks of 
vacation are given within the year. Conferences are held between 
the manufacturer and the dean of the engineering college and the 
professor of electrical, mechanical, or chemical engineering, as the 
case may be, in order that the technical instruction and the practical 
training may be properly correlated and the needs of the student be 
met. In the factory the student follows the course of the machine 
being constructed, from the raw material to the finished product 
ready to be sold. Work is begun in the shop about July 1 of the 
summer preceding the opening of the college session. The entrance 
requirements for these courses are the same as for the ordinary four- 
year course. . 
A student is paid for the shopwork done an amount sufficient to 
cover a considerable portion of his necessary expenses. For the first 
period of approximately nine hundred and ninety hours he is paid 
10 cents per hour. After that an increase of 1 cent per hour for 
each period is made until the twelfth period is reached, when 21 
cents per hour is paid.
-P-A-G-E-180
  168 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
The university expenses for tuition and laboratory fees are about 
as follows: For the first year, $90; second year, $80; third year, $65; 
fourth year, $65; fifth year, $65; sixth year, $65. 
The university cooperates with railroads, bridge and structural 
steel firms, reenforced concrete companies, and general contractors. 
Mr. E. F. DuBrul, a member of the board of directors of the 
university, has been largely instrumental in introducing and per- 
fecting the cooperative courses of that institution. The following 
remarks of his regarding their practical operation were made at 
the Thirteenth Annual Convention of the National Association of 
Manufacturers (1908) : 
The cooperative course in the University of Cincinnati * * * has been 
so successful in the last two years during which it has been operating that we 
have at least seven or eight schools that are now working at plans in the 
cooperative line as to training mechanics in different branches. They do not 
propose to give any seven and a half hours a week for two years and expect 
to make a mechanic, as our friends do up in Menominee. We do not believe 
they can doit. * * * 
There are just two difficulties about it. One difficulty is a cooperation of 
the school with the shop and the other the cooperation of the shop with the 
school. Some shopmen thought we were going to get a lot of kid-glove appren- 
tices, and some professors thought we were going to get tobacco-chewing 
students. The foremen found that they got the best apprentices they ever 
had and the professors found they got the best students they ever had. The 
influence of the university is working on down to the high schools. More 
boys are going to the Cincinnati high schools with the idea of taking a technical 
education along those lines. We have over 2,000 applications to our university 
to enter this course, where they learn the trade, not as the schools of engineer- 
ing have been doing, puddling around for a few hours a week in a play shop, 
but where they sign for six years. During those six years they get just as 
many hours of apprenticeship at the trade as any other apprentice gets. They 
get the same sort of treatment that any other apprentice gets—no better and no 
‘worse, *::* * 
Now, the same principle is applicable to the lower grade of industrial training 
as well as it is to the higher grade. It is applicable in almost any kind of a 
manufacturing industry. It may be applicable in constructive industries, build- 
ing, and so on. We do not know, as we haye not tried that, but we have tried 
it in all sorts of manufacturing industries as far as the higher training goes, and 
we believe, going from the one premise to the other, that it is going to be 
applicable all the way through. 
It is an economical system. When it was shown to us that it would save all 
the expense of equipment that is necessary in a school shop and that it costs 
so very, very little after you have put it in, the board was very anxious to try 
the plan. And, as I say, we are more than delighted, and our students are 
more than delighted. This great saving can be made in the matter of equip- 
ment in any other line of business or in any other sort of school * * * It 
is curious, but it is a fact, that our boys are doing more intellectual work in 
half the time at the university than the other students in the regular classes 
are doing in their full time. They have gone through the same examinations, 
they have taken the same class work, and they have passed with 25 per cent 
better grades, * * *
-P-A-G-E-181
    
INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 169 
We propose to extend our system on down through the high schools, and our 
high schools, as I say, are asking that it be established. * * * 
The Bell Telephone Company proposes to make our university its training 
school and will take on from 10 to 15 students per year. These will be the 
brightest young men to be found by the various Bell managers in their respec- 
tive towns. 
Dean Herman Schneider, of the college of engineering in the uni- 
versity, writes (July, 1909) that many changes are being made in the 
university end of the cooperative courses. It is intended to operate the 
engineering college hereafter eleven months in the year, on the alter- 
nate week basis, for the course of six years. 
During this half-time work [he says] we shall give as much technical and 
cultural instruction as is given in the usual five-year regular course. This 
will seem astonishing, but a computation of the number of weeks of actual 
instruction our men will receive as compared with that received by the five- 
year regular men eight months in the year will show that we are not far 
wrong. There must also be subtracted the shopwork given in the usual “ regu- 
Jar” instruction, likewise a lot of the so-called technical courses, which are 
mere descriptions of technical processes, all of which our student learns in the 
commercial shops of Cincinnati during his regular apprenticeship. Moreover, 
the course through the shop is as carefully scheduled and looked after by the 
university authorities as the course through the university. We are introduc- 
ing this year shop coordinators, whose function will be to coordinate weekly 
the practice at the shops with the theory at the university. 
Dean Schneider states in another connection that a cooperative. 
course has been devised for a department store and is about to be put 
in operation. 
LEWIS INSTITUTE, CHICAGO, ILL. 
A plan modeled after that of the University of Cincinnati but par- 
taking more of the nature of secondary instruction, has been worked 
out by the Lewis Institute, and was put into effect at the opening 
of the winter quarter of 1908-9. The course covers a period of two 
years, and is open to approved students of from 16 to 20 years of age. 
Here, as at Cincinnati, a class is divided into two sections, which 
alternate with each other in class and shop from week to week. The 
institute gives instruction eight hours a day for five days in a week in 
subjects kindred to the chosen trade of the student. Saturdays and 
the summer months are devoted entirely to shopwork, but two weeks 
of vacation and rest from study are allowed. 
About 20 metal-trade manufacturing establishments of Chicago 
have taken advantage of the opportunity offered by this plan, and 40 
boys have been selected for apprenticeship. 
The manufacturer pays a tuition fee of $50 a year for each student, 
and pays the student $5 a week for every week he works in the shop. 
Thus the cost to the employer, including tuition fee, is $180 a year 
for each boy employed.

  170 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
FITCHBURG HIGH SCHOOL, FITCHBURG, MASS. 
In this case a cooperative industrial course has been introduced in 
a public high school. The course is of four years’ duration, but the 
first year is devoted wholly to literary studies. At the beginning of 
the second year any boy may, with the consent of his parents, elect 
the cooperative course. At the Fitchburg school, as in the case of the 
other two institutions considered, the class-room instruction and the 
work in a factory alternate with each other, a week at a time being de- 
voted to each. A two-months’ trial period begins on the 1st of July 
preceding the beginning of the course of study in the school. For 
the session of 1908-9 20 boys were enrolled. 
The scale of wages paid the apprentice for shopwork in each period 
of about one thousand six hundred and fifty hours is as follows: For 
the first period, 10 cents per hour; for the second period, 11 cents; 
for the third period, 124 cents. No tuition fee is charged the student 
in school. 
Of the success of the plan thus far Supt. Joseph G. Edgerly writes: 
The manufacturers have expressed great satisfaction with the plan, some of 
them having expressed the opinion at this early day that these boys are supe- 
rior to those formerly employed. They are boys who have their eyes and ears 
open, who think and ask questions of an intelligent nature. * * * With the 
course mapped out, it is expected that a thinking, progressive mechanic will be 
secured—one who will be able to reason things out for himself, and thereby to 
derive for himself the greatest advantage that can be attained in his life work. 
This plan is carried out without any expense to the city of Fitch- 
burg. No special buildings or equipment are required, such as would 
be necessary in the case of a regular trade school. The boys work in 
real shops under actual business conditions, and the pay they get 
enables many to learn a trade and at the same time continue their 
education up through the high school. 
The Fitchburg News devoted a recent issue (June 17, 1909) largely 
to the results of an investigation of the cooperative system as carried 
out in the high school of that place. In the course of an editorial 
summing up of conditions the paper said in substance: 
Early last year Professor Schneider explained his new system to a company 
of manufacturers in New York City, at a meeting attended by several men from 
the city of Fitchburg. These manufacturers came home, agitated the plan, and 
secured the interest of the local school board so that the same system was 
finally put in operation here last September. Results have more than justified 
this course. The most earnest enthusiast has seen his prophecies come true. 
It is a fact worthy of note that both the superintendent of schools and the 
manufacturers whom we quote in our news story to-day, and who now indorse 
the system unreservedly, were among the skeptics at the beginning of the year. 
For the first time, too, we learn what the boys think of the plan, and they are 
the ones most closely concerned and affected by it. Their replies are all in its 
favor, and there can be no doubt as to its success and practicability.

  INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. Lit 
Freeport, Ill, is reported to have also adopted a cooperative plan 
whereby high school students may work half time in factories. 
COOPERATIVE COURSE IN SHOE MANUFACTURING, AT BEVERLY, MASS. 
Beverly’s industrial school, planned along new lines, was opened 
yesterday for the first time with a registration of 42 students. 
Practical work was carried on at the model shop at the plant of the 
United Shoe Machinery Company, at Elliott street, where an equip- 
ment costing $35,000 has been installed by the company. The line 
of machinery embraces machines and tools that are found in the best 
equipped machine shops in the country. The shop is on the third 
floor of building B, with plenty of light and with every convenience. 
While one division is working at the machine shop the other divi- 
sion is taking up the theoretical work at the high school. The divi- 
sions will spend alternate weeks at the shop and at the school through 
the year. 
The school is the result of the investigation by a special com- 
mission, of which George H. Vose, assistant superiritendent of the 
shoe machinery company, was chairman. 
The shoe machinery company offered to fit up a shop at its plant 
at Ryal Side, and this made the school possible. The city appro- 
priated $1,800, which will pay for the instruction, and the State, 
it is expected, will make an equal appropriation. The company will 
pay an agreed price for the finished product, will furnish the ma- 
terials at cost, and has made other concessions. 
The theoretical work includes mathematics, mechanics, chemistry of 
materials used in the factory, free-hand sketching, blueprint reading, 
mechanical drawing, English, civics, and industrial economics. The 
shopwork will bring the boys in touch with the spirit of the big 
factory. The combination of school and shop work will be one which 
will be watched closely throughout the country. There are two 
practical instructors, skilled machinists. The school is in charge of 
a board of trustees, of which Mayor Trowt is chairman. (Boston 
Herald, Aug. 3, 1909.) 
METROPOLITAN STREET RAILWAY COMPANY’S TRAINING SCHOOL, 
NEW YORK. 
The following circular was issued by Oren Root, general manager 
for the receivers of the Metropolitan Street Railway Company, under 
date of May 15, 1909: 
To young men desiring to enter a street railway training school: 
It is my intention to establish a practical training school for young men, 
particularly graduates of high school, manual training schools, colleges, or  
-P-A-G-E-184
  172 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
universities, who have had more or less technical training and who intend 
to enter upon the vocation of operating street railroads. ss 
It is the aim to make the conditions advantageous to the young man who 
has an inclination to enter upon work of this character, but who, from lack 
of knowledge of practical conditions, does not feel able to make a definite 
decision. Such a man, under the proposed plan, will be afforded an opportunity 
of acquainting himself with the details of this work, while at the same time 
receiving a salary which, with strict economy, will enable him to be self-sup- 
porting. He may thus determine for himself whether he is fitted and has a 
liking for employment of this character; on the other hand, the Metropolitan 
Street Railway Company will profit by the experiment in that it will be possible 
to test the capacity, ability, and adaptability of applicants, who will constitute 
a body of candidates from whom men may be chosen when it becomes necessary 
to fill vacancies in the regular operating staff. 
During the first year, the student will be paid at the rate of $15 per week. 
In order to give him a general idea of the railroad system, he will be assigned 
to duty in the maintenance of way, the electrical, the equipment, and the 
transportation departments, spending three months in each department. [Here 
follow the details of the different lines of duty in each department.] 
It is expected that the membership in this school will be limited to approxi- 
mately eight men at any one time, thus involving an assignment of two such 
men to each of the departments above mentioned during each three months’ 
period, but the employment of students under such conditions will in no way 
constitute a guaranty that they will be continued in the service unless they are 
found to perform their duties in a satisfactory manner. On the other hand, 
they will be dropped if they prove incompetent; but if they complete the first 
year of apprenticeship, they will be definitely assigned to that department for 
the performance of the duties of which they have manifested the greatest 
ability, and dating from the time of such appointment they will be paid at the 
rate of $20 per week. 
After they have been so employed for one year, or, in other words, after the 
expiration of their second year’s service with the company, if there are any 
vacancies in the permanent staff of the company, these men will be given 
permanent positions; but if not they will be awarded a certificate of service, 
stating the character of the work which they have performed and containing 
such recommendation as they may be entitled to receive. 
It should be distinctly understood by those men who think they would like 
to take advantage of the opportunity thus afforded that the tasks which they 
will be called upon to perform will often involve night and Sunday work, as 
the street cars in New York City are operated twenty-four hours a day during 
the entire year. It is not recommended that any man should apply for such 
a position as above described unless he is strong physically and is prepared to 
perform hard work. 
In considering applications, preference will be given to those men who have 
received a technical education, including such courses as electrical or mechan- 
ical engineering, as a knowledge of such subjects will be of material advantage 
to the student. The lack of such a training, however, will not preclude the 
consideration of an application, nor will it necessarily militate against the 
success of the student in departments of the company where this technical 
training is not indispensable. Applications will be received from men who have 
been out of school or college for several years, as well as from men who are 
to be graduated this year. * * *

INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 173 
FRANKLIN UNION, BOSTON, MASS. 
At his death Benjamin Franklin left to his native city of Boston 
£1,000, which was to be loaned at 5 per cent interest per annum to 
aid young printers in starting business. At the end of one hundred 
years the accrued amount was to be divided, a portion being con- 
tinued at interest for a second century, and a portion being expended 
in “ public works which may be judged of most general utility to 
the inhabitants, such as fortifications, bridges, aqueducts, public 
buildings, pavements, or whatever may make life in the town more 
convenient to its people and render it more agreeable to strangers 
resorting thither for health or temporary residence.” 
The fund thus created became available in 1891, but litigation was 
necessary in order to secure a construction of Franklin’s will by the 
courts. Accordingly, the supreme court was asked to construe the 
will, which resulted in the appointment of a board of managers con- 
sisting of twelve citizens. It was decided by the board to establish 
an industrial school, and the fund of approximately $400,000 was 
expended in providing a building and equipment. To provide for 
maintenance, Mr. Andrew Carnegie gave sufficient funds to produce 
an annual income of about $20,000. The school was formally opened 
in September, 1908. Only men who are employed during the day 
are admitted to its classes. Evening classes are held on Mondays, 
Wednesdays, and Thursdays. The season comprises seventy-two 
evenings. 
Courses of two seasons’ duration are offered in machine construc- 
tion, industrial electricity, steam engines and boilers, structures, 
architectural working drawing, and industrial chemistry. Courses 
of one season duration are offered in sheet metal drafting, mechanical 
drawing, industrial arithmetic and shop formule, estimating for 
architects and builders, firemen’s class, heating and ventilating, prac- 
tical mechanics, heat, and hydraulics, and gas and gasoline fixtures. 
Tf sufficient interest can be secured, Saturday afternoon classes will 
be organized in the season of 1909-10. 
ROCHESTER FACTORY SCHOOLS. 
During the summer of 1908 the board of education of Rochester, 
N. Y., made an investigation “to determine what form of education 
would best fit boys and girls to enter the industries of the city.” The 
supervisor of manual training was directed to visit a number of local 
factories and ascertain their needs and requirements in this regard. 
Superintendents and foremen were asked these questions: 
1. What deficiencies do you find in the education of the boys and girls who 
come to work in your factories which prevent them from rapid advancement?
-P-A-G-E-186
  174 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
2. Can you suggest any form of manual or mental training which would in- 
crease their earning power and make their promotion more rapid? 
In response to these inquiries superintendents and foremen of fac- 
tories indicated in substance the class of boys wanted, as follows: 
1. Boys who can apply the mathematics they have learned in school to the 
actual problems of the factory. 
2. Boys who can state their needs to the foreman clearly and concisely. 
3. Boys of wider general information who know something of the materials 
used and the processes of their preparation. 
4, Boys who will take an interest in their work and stick to the trade being 
Jearned. 
As a result of this investigation it was decided to open an industrial 
improvement school, and the Rochester Factory School, opened De- 
cember 1, 1908, was the outcome. An 8-room elementary school 
building was fitted up with rooms for shopwork, drawing, and study. 
During the spring term of 1909, 100 boys received instruction. These 
were divided into four classes of equal size, as follows: Class A, ad- 
vanced woodworking; class B, elementary woodworking; class C, 
advanced mechanical and electrical work; class D, elementary me- 
chanical and electrical work. 
The following is the course of study for the first year:

The school is open from 8.30 a. m. until 3 p. m., with a half hour 
at noon for luncheon. On Saturdays the shops are open from 8.30 
a.m. to 12 noon. Only short summer vacations are allowed. 
Other factory schools are to be opened from time to time as the 
demand for them grows. Mr. Alfred P. Fletcher, formerly super- 
visor of manual training, is director of industrial training. (Circular 
of division of trades schools, New York, educational department.) 
SCHOOL FOR APPRENTICES OF THE LAKESIDE PRESS, CHICAGO. 
The school for apprentices of the Lakeside Press was organized 
July 6, 1908, with the object of training competent compositors, 
pressmen, and other workmen for its many departments, some of 
whom will be able to fill responsible positions in the factory and 
counting room. As stated in the announcement of the school, issued 
May 1, 1909, boys have a hard time learning a trade under modern 
conditions: 
The workmen are either too busy, or have no inclination to be bothered, and 
as a result the apprentices pick up what knowledge of the trade they can, 
usually imitating some workman, good or bad, alongside of whom they may 
work. 
 
-P-A-G-E-187
    HOME ECONOMICS. 175 
To meet this situation the Lakeside Press takes boys and teaches 
them the trade under factory conditions, at the same time continuing 
their academic education. 
Only grammar school graduates between 14 and 15 are admitted 
as apprentice compositors to the school. For apprentice pressmen 
the age requirement is between 16 and 18. A contract is entered into, 
the firm in each case agreeing to teach the boy the trade, and the 
parents agreeing that the son shall remain as an apprentice for a term 
of years. The boys are paid $2.40 per week the first year, this being 
at the rate of 10 cents per hour for the time actually in the factory. 
The second year the rate is $3 per week. Beginning with the third 
year the rate is $5 per week, with a substantial increase every six 
months, until the scale of $20 per week is reached at the end of the 
apprenticeship. 
The students are in school three and one-half hours daily the first 
two years, one-half of this time being devoted to trade instruction 
and one-half to academic work. They also work four and one-half 
hours daily in the shops in different departments, where they select 
ultimately the department they will enter. After the first two years 
they will work regular shop hours in the factory, except two or three 
hours a week devoted to school work, this latter including a review 
of arithmetic with applications to the printing trade, algebra, physi- 
ography, and particularly English. 
SCHOOL OF THE LEHIGH VALLEY COAL COMPANY. 
The Lehigh Valley Coal Company has opened a trial school for its 
employees at Lost Creek, Schuylkill County, Pa. The courses of 
study of the International Correspondence School, of Scranton, Pa., 
are used, supplemented by personal instruction. Employees are ad- 
mitted upon the application of their immediate superior. The only 
charge to students is the cost of the correspondence course. The com- 
pany provides teachers, rooms, equipment, and lecturers. The enroll- 
ment in February, 1909, amounted to about 100. The students were 
taking various technical courses, more or less directly connected with 
coal mining. 
XII. HOME ECONOMICS. 
  
SCHOOL OF HOUSEHOLD ARTS, TEACHERS COLLEGE, COLUMBIA 
UNIVERSITY. 
A school of household arts was organized in 1909 as a division of 
Teachers College, Columbia University. As stated in its first an- 
nouncement for 1909-10, it is designed primarily to provide prepara- 
tion for teaching positions of all grades, from the primary school to   
 
-P-A-G-E-188
    
176 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
the university, in the special fields of the household arts and sciences; 
also for positions as supervisors of domestic science and art in the 
public schools, heads of departments in normal schools, and superin- 
tendents and teachers in training schools for nurses; also special 
preparation for various social workers who teach the household arts 
in connection with settlements and other social institutions. : 
A two years’ professional curriculum, requiring the previous com- 
pletion of two years of academic or technical training in advance of 
the usual college-entrance requirements, leads to a bachelor’s degree 
in education. Graduate curricula for advanced students lead to 
higher degrees and diplomas. All candidates for degrees and diplo- 
mas must spend at least one year in residence. : 
Not only is provision made for the training of teachers, but a 
proper combination of courses provides the necessary technical train- 
ing for institutional positions which require much the same equip- 
ment, such as those of household manager in school and college 
dormitories, hospitals, and other institutional households, dietitian 
in institutions, superintendent of school lunch rooms, manager of 
institutional laundries, superintendent of day nurseries, house deco- 
rator, etc. 
The courses given in this school are grouped under 10 heads: (1) 
Household arts education; (2) nutrition; (3) household chemistry, 
physiological chemistry; (4) foods and cookery; (5) textiles and 
needlework; (6) household arts, fine arts; (7) household administra- 
tion; (8) hospital economy; (9) physiology, bacteriology, hygiene; 
(10) house structure and sanitation. 
Special classes are provided for nonmatriculated part-time students 
who wish to perfect themselves in such subjects as household manage- 
ment, buying, household accounts, home care of the sick, care of 
infants and small children; foods, and cookery in its various divi- 
sions; and various divisions of textiles and needlework. 
In September, 1909, will be opened a building costing more than 
$500,000, and devoted exclusively to instruction in the domestic arts 
and sciences. One floor is devoted to foods and cookery, another to 
textiles and needlework, another to the application of chemical and 
biological sciences to household matters. There will also be various 
special studios and laboratories. 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOL OF MANUAL ARTS AND HOME ECONOMICS 
AT SANTA BARBARA, CAL. 
On the 27th of March, 1909, Governor Gillett, of California, ap- 
proved a bill creating the above-named normal school, said to be the 
first of its kind in the United States. The legislature appropriated 
$10,000 with which to begin in August the work of the school in
-P-A-G-E-189

training teachers for this branch of public education. Miss Ednah 
A. Rich, through whose efforts mainly the school was established, 
has been elected president of the institution by the state board of 
education. Teachers who have had a year of successful experience, 
normal and university graduates, and students from such institutions 
who bring satisfactory recommendations, will be admitted as students. 
Previous preparation in methods of teaching, pedagogy, and psychol- 
ogy is required before entrance. The one-year course will entitle 
graduates to teach in elementary schools the special subjects studied. 
This state school absorbs the Anna 8. C. Blake Manual Training 
Normal School, heretofore conducted by the city. 
NEW COURSES IN HOME ECONOMICS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF 
WISCONSIN. 
A University of Wisconsin bulletin announces (June, 1909) that the 
courses to be given during the next college year in the reorganized 
department of home economics of the college of agriculture of the 
university include three distinct lines of work adapted to different 
classes of students, as follows: 
1. A four-year general course with special reference to preparation 
for home making, leading to the degree of bachelor of science. 
2. A general course in home economics, including supplementary 
work in pedagogy, which will prepare students for teaching domestic 
science in grade and high schools. 
3. A general survey course in home economics for those desiring 
only a general knowledge of this subject, which may be pursued by 
students in the college of letters and science who are candidates for the 
degree of bachelor of arts. 
For advanced students, a teachers’ course will take up more ad- 
vanced problems, and an opportunity for special investigation in 
home economics will be offered. 
STOUT INSTITUTE HOME MAKERS’ SCHOOL, 
Stout Institute, Menomonie, Wis., established a home maker’s school 
in 1907, designed to prepare young women for the responsibilities of _ 
home life. The subjects included in the course are the house, food 
study and cooking, clothing and household fabrics, care and nurture 
of children, home nursing and emergencies, and the social, industrial, 
and ethical relations of the woman in the home and in society. 
Eighteen students were enrolled in the course in the year 1908-9. 
In September, 1908, the institute organized a trade school for 
plumbers and bricklayers. There were enrolled 16 students in the 
course for plumbers and 1 in the course for bricklayers.

AMERICAN HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION. 
At the meeting of the Lake Placid conference on home economics, 
held at Chautauqua, N. Y., in 1908, a committee on organization was 
appointed to draw up a constitution and working plans for the 
American Home Economics Association. The committee submitted 
its report at the meeting of the teachers’ section of the Lake Placid 
conference at Washington, D. C., December 31, 1908, when the Ameri- 
can Home Economics Association was organized. 
The object of the association, as stated in its constitution, shall be 
“to improve the conditions of living in the home, the institutional 
household, and the community.” It shall aim to advance its pur- 
pose— 
by the study of problems connected with the household; by securing recogni- 
tion of subjects related to the home in the curricula of existing schools and 
colleges; by. securing the establishment and standardization of professional 
courses and schools for the training of teachers, and of home, institutional, 
social and municipal workers; by encouraging and aiding investigations and 
research in universities and by the state and federal governments; by publi- 
cations, professional and popular; and by meetings, local and national, that 
knowledge may be increased, and especially that public opinion may be in- 
formed and advancement made secure by legislative enactment. 
All who are interested in home problems are eligible to membership 
in the association. The association meets annually. It publishes 
The Journal of Home Economics, which is issued bimonthly. The 
principal officers for 1909 are Mrs. Ellen H. Richards, Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, Boston, Mass., president; Mr. Benjamin R. 
Andrews, Teachers College, Columbia University, New York City, 
secretary-treasurer. 
XIV. COEDUCATION OF THE SEXES. 
Coeducation, or the instruction of both sexes in the same schools 
and classes, which is always a subject of more or less discussion in 
this country, has recently occupied unusual attention in States in 
which the policy seemed to be most firmly established. This discus- 
sion pertains entirely to the sphere of secondary and collegiate educa- 
tion. The elementary public schools throughout the country are, as 
a rule, coeducational. The few exceptions are found in cities on the 
Atlantic seaboard, in which free public schools were first established 
for boys only, and the subsequent demand for similar provision for 
girls was necessarily met by new buildings and accommodations. 
This arrangement affects but a small proportion—not above 4 per 
cent—of the pupils enrolled in elementary schools.
-P-A-G-E-191
    COEDUCATION OF THE SEXES. 179 
i: 
SEGREGATION AT THE ENGLEWOOD HIGH SCHOOL. 
Separate high schools have long been maintained in Boston (the 
old city), New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Charleston, and 
New Orleans. In the West the high schools have universally fol- 
lowed the course of the elementary schools in this respect, and hence 
the experiment of segregation undertaken in the high school of 
Englewood (Chicago) some four years ago excited unusual attention. 
The following account of the experiment referred to has been fur- 
nished to the office by Principal Armstrong: 
The experiment in instructing boys and girls in segsegated classes was begun 
in the Englewood High School, Chicago, in February, 1906. The entering class 
at that time consisted of about 150 pupils. Their programmes were so arranged 
that while they met in the same division rooms and studied in the same study 
hall, they recited all lessons in segregated classes. Classes were so distributed 
that every teacher who had a boys’ class had also a girls’ class. This was not 
only to give teachers a chance to see the contrasts, but to prevent the criticism 
that one sex was to be given the advantage of the better teachers. 
At the end of the first half year a referendum of the parents was taken on 
the two following questions: 
1. Do you feel that your child was benefited by being in a segregated class? 
Yes or no. 
2. Would you advise that the plan be extended to the next incoming class? 
Ninety per cent answered both questions in the affirmative. The September 
class, consisting of about 500 pupils, was segregated in the same way, and after 
a year’s trial a second referendum was taken on the same questions, except 
that the ballots were accompanied by a stamped envelope addressed to the 
superintendent instead of being returned by the pupil to the school. The result 
of this larger referendum was that 85 per cent answered yes to both questions. 
The work was then extended to the second-year class, and now about 1,000 
pupils are being taught’in segregated classes in their first and second years. 
The immediate result has been to increase the relative number of boys in the 
second and third years of school, and to materially improve their scholarship. 
Heretofore the scholarship of boys was far inferior to that of the girls. Now, 
with the adaptations of the work which we have been able to make, the boy 
comes to the upper classes better equipped than ever before. The former plan 
of giving both a boys’ class and a girls’ class to the same teacher has not been 
kept up, for the reason that it was found that not all teachers are equally well 
adapted to teaching both sexes. Nor does it follow that all men are better 
adapted to teaching boys than women are. As a general rule, however, boys do 
better under men teachers during these beginning years of adolescence. 
The most obvious facts beside those stated above are that pupils and parents 
like the plan. Pupils say that they get closer together, understand each other 
better, and are not so afraid of being criticised. The leading traits of the sexes 
are more marked and so the teacher can see better how to adapt the work to 
the needs of the class. The classification of pupils makes grading more perfect, 
and hence less friction. The teacher can develop her subject more logically. 
There is a little more reserve noticed between the sexes, and the opportunities 
for the smart boy to show off are considerably less. Boys will not tolerate 
conduct in the segregated class that all wink at if there are girls present to 
laugh. The discipline in the boys’ classes can be made more stern without 
making it unnecessarily severe on the girls. In some studies, such as physi-
-P-A-G-E-192
  180 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
ology, the work is made more personal, and in written work the boys’ habit 
of postponing the disagreeable task is prevented by supplying the needed will 
power for immediate action. In history the boy is interested in a different line 
of events than the girl and so makes greater progress alone, while in all studies 
that require observation and logical reasoning and experiment he excels. The 
girl excels in all languages, literature, and art. In mixed classes neither one 
helps the other, as each is impatient to go on in his or her own course. 
As principal of the school I am highly gratified with the work, and believe we 
are doing far more for both sexes than ever before. I wish to deny the impli- 
cation that boys are superior to girls because they finally become, or may become, 
intellectual leaders, or that girls are superior to boys as shown by the scholar- 
ship records of every secondary school. This experiment has shown me that 
each is superior to the other sex in the traits of character and the kind of 
intellect nature requires of each. We, the educators, have been at fault in 
not recognizing that man and woman live and move in parallel courses, and that 
at the beginning of that period when nature is trying to differentiate the sexes 
we have been working against her by providing identical instruction, as if the 
life work of each was to be the same. 
My conviction is that we should keep the boy and the girl in the same high 
school so as to preserve the same social environment, but teach them in different 
classes so as to adapt the work to the highest needs of each. 
SYSTEM PURSUED AT THE CLEVELAND TECHNICAL HIGH SCHOOL. 
The Cleveland Technical High School is organized on a plan some- 
what different from that which prevails in other schools of its class 
in this country. 
As stated by Mr. Elson, superintendent of schools: 
The boys and girls are in separate classes, with separate study halls. This 
arrangement exists, not for reasons of sex, but because of the widely different 
kind of work. The academic work in this school is related very closely to the 
technical or shop work, so that the chemistry which the girls have, being 
chiefly applied chemistry, is different from that taken by the boys. The same 
is true of physics, English, mathematics, etc. 
Practically, it will be seen that a school’ for boys and a school for 
girls are conducted in the same building under one direction. The 
prospectus issued by the institution states: 
The department for girls will have domestic science and domestic and 
industrial art for its basis, and around these studies the rest of their work will 
be grouped. Home-making courses are of greatest value to girls, and to train 
in this direction will be the aim of these departments. Cooking will be very 
practical and comprehensive, covering preparation and analysis of foods, the 
study of food values, and the preparation and serving of complete meals. This 
will be supplemented by courses in home planning and house decoration, taking 
up the study and arrangement of rooms, wall and floor coverings, study of 
furniture and pictures, draperies, ete. This will be organized with particular 
reference to economy and good taste. Segregated classes for the study of 
physiology and personal hygiene will give students an opportunity to acquire 
a knowledge of those things which are so essential to their future health and 
happiness.
-P-A-G-E-193
COEDUCATION OF THE SEXES, 181 
This instruction will be supplemented by a complete course in home nursing, 
including first aid to the injured, the care of invalids and particularly of children. 
Instruction in our high schools has never been specific enough along these lines, 
but has been of a purely general nature. ‘These courses are to be very practical 
and to the point, to the end that when a girl has forced upon her the care of the 
home and the family she will be thoroughly prepared for functions of this 
sort. Keeping of household accounts, economic home management, marketing, 
ete., will receive due consideration. 
Similar opportunities for specialization during the last two years of the 
course will be offered girls as are provided for boys. In most classes the nature 
of the studies and method of teaching demand a separation of boys from girls, 
The school has been in operation over a year, and is conducted on 
the basis of four twelve-week terms with a week of vacation following 
each term. The experiment of a summer quarter has been tried the 
present year, and a large enrollment is reported. The superintendent 
expresses the opinion that this is the first instance in this country of 
the maintenance of a public high school all the year around. 
ADMISSION OF WOMEN DISCONTINUED AT WESLEYAN UNIVERSITY. 
The year has been marked by a few events that have excited 
renewed discussion of coeducation as related to universities. 
The admission of women students to Wesleyan University, Middle- 
town, Conn., is discontinued by a vote of the trustees at a special 
meeting held in New York in March last, 30 out of the 50 members 
of the board being present. 
The text of the resolution is as follows: 
Resolved, That no woman be admitted to Wesleyan University in any class 
later than that entering in the year 1909; but nothing in this action shall be 
construed as in any way conflicting with the rights and privileges of any woman 
who may be or become a member of that class or of any previous class. 3 
Wesleyan University is a. Methodist institution founded in 1831. 
Women were admitted in 1872, but they have never formed a large 
proportion of the students, and the present year numbered only 30 
as against 292 men. The alumni and undergraduate male students 
| have manifested decided opposition to the women students, and it is 
understood that a number of the trustees who voted for the above 
resolution are not opposed to the idea of coeducation, but were satis- 
fied that women students would not be accorded proper recognition 
under the existing circumstances. 
It is understood that the proposition to establish a coordinate col- 
lege for women is favorably viewed by the trustees, but this would be 
impossible unless new endowments are forthcoming. A committee 
has been appointed to secure the needed funds, and if this is accom- 
plished a college will be established for women holding relations to 
Wesleyan University similar to those existing between Harvard and 
Radcliffe, Columbia and Barnard, and Brown and Pembroke.

    182 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
COEDUCATION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN—ADDRESS BY PRESIDENT 
VAN HISE. 
An arrangement in the University of Wisconsin for the separation 
of students by sex in certain classes, intended primarily for the advan- 
tage of the women students, excited apprehensions in some minds that 
that university might adopt measures discriminating against women. 
The fear of such action is dissipated by the following resolution 
passed by the board of regents, June, 1908: 
Men and women shall be equally entitled to membership in all classes of the 
university, and there shall be no discrimination on account of sex in granting 
scholarships and fellowships in any of the colleges or departments of the 
university. rc 
It is not out of place to recall here an important contribution to the 
discussion of coeducation made by President Van Hise, of the Uni- 
versity of Wisconsin, in his address before the Association of 
Collegiate Alumnz at the quarter-centennial meeting in Boston, 
November 6, 1907, which has been the theme of much subsequent 
controversy. 
Among special aspects of the subject unfolded in that address is 
that of a social problem arising from “the increase in numbers of 
men and women in coeducational institutions with no very serious 
purpose.” As a consequence of this increase, President Van Hise 
says: 
There is undoubtedly a tendency among the women to regard as successful 
the one who is attractive to the young men—in other words, social availability 
rather than intellectual leadership is regarded by at least a considerable number 
of the young women as the basis of a successful college career. While this view 
may seem absurd, a little reflection will convince one that the tendency is 
perfectly natural—indeed, is as deep seated as many of the most-firmly 
established traditions in reference to the relations between the sexes. So far 
as I can see, this obstacle will always be a real one in coeducational institutions. 
A satisfactory solution of the problem of social affairs will only be accomplished 
by a recognition of its existence, by the development among the young women of 
their own ideals through insistence that they shall set their own standards in 
coeducational as in the women’s college—that they shall not accept the standard 
of the least earnest fraction of the young men—that of social availability. 
A second consideration arises from a tendency toward “ segregation 
by subjects and courses.” On this point Dr. Van Hise says: 
When, as a matter of fact, in a given course women, for one reason or 
another, become predominant; this acts as a deterrent to the free election of the 
course by considerable numbers of young men, and vice versa. 
To this natural segregation is added, he notes, “ segregation on a 
large scale by the establishment of courses and colleges which are 
practically for the one sex or the other.” Instances of this latter 
condition are the colleges of engineering, law, commerce, agriculture,
-P-A-G-E-195

and medicine, essentially men’s colleges, and similarly courses for 
training the heads of households, established for women. 
Doctor Van Hise sums up his whole presentation of this case as 
follows: 
Blindly ignoring facts and persisting in an old policy, regardless of results, 
will weaken rather than strengthen coeducation. Believing as I do that the 
adoption of coeducation in the West, which has led to the higher education of 
tens of thousands of women who would otherwise have had no opportunity to 
obtain a college training, has been of immeasurable importance to the nation; 
believing as I do that coeducation gives satisfactory scholastic results for both 
sexes, I am in favor of taking such steps as are necessary to maintain coeduca- 
tion in full vigor in the colleges of liberal arts.¢ 
ADJUSTMENT OF THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF 
PRACTICAL LIFE. 
The general movement for the higher education of women has 
apparently not been affected by the action of particular institutions in 
regard to coeducation. The public sensitiveness with respect to this 
subject obscures sometimes the importance of efforts on the part of 
university authorities to bring about a fuller and better adjustment 
of their facilities to the requirements of professional and social life. 
The consideration of sex necessarily determines some of these ad- 
justments, since they pertain to the opportunities and duties that 
practical life presents to students after formal education is completed. 
For example, the provision for courses of instruction in domestic 
science and arts has special reference to women students. The im- 
portance of such courses is greatly increased by the call for the appli- 
cation of the knowledge and training thus imparted in new fields of 
municipal service and institutional administration. In view of this 
enlarging field of activity, the department of instruction in household 
arts at Columbia University has been expanded into a school which 
will open in September fully equipped with a laboratory building 
and studios costing over half a million. The comprehensive plans of 
this school include courses of instruction for the preparation of 
teachers of household arts in schools and colleges, as well as for the 
technical instruction of women who wish to be qualified to manage 
their own households or become administrators of larger institutional 
households. There are certificate courses for the dietitian and for 
the training of women who purpose to apply their artistic gifts to 
interior decoration, and departments of dressmaking, millinery, cos- 
tume designing, home architecture, etc. This school is more fully 
described on page 175.

The regents of the University of Wisconsin have provided for the 
reorganization of the department of home economics, which is to be 
located in Lathrop Hall, a new building for women students, where it 
will occupy rooms specially fitted for its accommodation. 
Bedford College for women, one of the colleges of the University 
of London, offers a special course in hygiene extending over four 
terms. The calendar of the university states that the course is— 
suited to the requirements of women wishing to become factory or sanitary in- 
spectors, teachers of hygiene under county councils and inspectors and health 
visitors for municipal councils, health and education committees or other 
organizations for promoting the public welfare. The course is arranged on a 
scientific basis, and includes lectures on hygiene and public health with demon- 
stration visits and inspections, lectures and practical work in chemistry, 
physics, physiology, and bacteriology. 
Kings College, London University, has just organized in the 
woman’s department a three-year course in home economics, leading 
to the diploma of mistress of home science. 
PROVISION FOR ADVANCED STUDY. 
In connection with movements relating to the higher education of 
women it is interesting to note the increasing aid and recognition 
accorded to women who devote themselves to professional or scientific 
pursuits. Among the few funds now available for women who are 
prepared for advanced study and research, the following may be 
noted : 
The Baltimore Association for the Promotion of the University 
Education of Women offers a fellowship of $500, available for study 
at an American or European university. In exceptional instances 
the fellowship may be held two successive years by the same person.* 
“The Society of American Women in London,” in combination 
with the General Federation of Women’s Clubs with which it is affili- 
ated, has founded a scholarship for women available at Oxford, 
Cambridge, or London University. The holder of the scholarship 
for the present year is studying at Oxford. It is hoped, eventually, 
to raise a fund sufficient to endow two scholarships for each State. 
The Woman’s Educational and Industrial Union of Boston, de- 
partment of research,? offers a fellowship for an investigation of 
present-day conditions which concern the industrial life of women 
or the condition of women in industry. Two alternatives are pro- 
vided by the plan for the fellowship: One, an opportunity looking 
toward a college degree by combining work in college courses with 
training in industrial research; the alternative plan provides for the

pursuit of research work at the Educational and Industrial Union 
alone, giving full time for one year of ten months with a fellowship 
of $500. 
Bryn Mawr College announces 10 graduate scholarships, 5 open 
to English, Irish, or Scotch, and 5 to German women students who 
have attained a standard equivalent to that of the bachelor’s degree 
as given by any American college or university of acknowledged 
standing. The scholarship covers the fees for board, residence, and 
tuition at Bryn Mawr College for one academic year, and amounts to 
$405. 
PROFESSIONAL RECOGNITION OF WOMEN ABROAD. 
The most important event of the year under review affecting the 
professional recognition of women is the action taken by the Council 
of the Royal College of Surgeons of England admitting women to 
the diploma of the college. 
The resolutions to that effect, adopted at the quarterly meeting of 
the college, held October 15, 1908, are as follows: 
Resolved, (a) That steps be forthwith taken to admit women to the exami- 
nations of the conjoint examining board in England, and to the examination for 
the diploma in public health; (b) that women be admitted to the examinations 
for the fellowship and to the examinations for the license in dental surgery. 
Tn accordance with this decision a new by-law relating to the ad- 
mission of women was made and ordained at the quarterly meeting 
of the council of the Royal College of Surgeons held April 1, current, 
and the same was duly submitted to the government authorities for 
sanction and ratification. 
This action brings to successful issue an effort that has been main- 
tained through twelve years of agitation and discussion. 
In the preceding report of this series attention was called to a 
memorial addressed to the fellows of the Chemical Society of Great 
Britain asking for an inquiry as to the views of the society as a whole 
on the question of admitting women to the fellowship. It is reported 
that— 
at a meeting of the Chemical Society, held at Burlington House on October 22, 
the president, Sir William Ramsay, announced that 1,758 voting papers had 
been received on the question of the admission of women as fellows of the 
society. There were 1,094 in favor of the admission of women, and 642 against. 
Some sent in no papers at all, and 22 papers were returned with no particular 
mark on them. The result of the ballot was received with applause. 
The following citation from a current journal is significant of the 
change that is gradually taking place in university circles of Eng- 
land relative to the recognition of women students: 
There was interest of more than one kind attached to a debate held the other 
day at the Cambridge Union on the question of whether the university ought

not “immediately” to admit the women who earn degrees to receive those 
honors. Up to the present, though the ‘women students of Girton and Newn- 
ham may take the same examinations as men—and, as a matter of fact, a large 
number of those women have gained very high honors—the university which 
consents thus to examine their acquirements refuses to allow them to receive 
the degrees that they have thus earned. The last time the matter was voted 
upon was in 1897, when it was decided by a large majority of the graduates 
not to redress this grievance, and on that occasion the undergraduates of the 
period demonstrated hotly against the lady students. If the recent vote at 
their principal debating society is a sufficient index of the view of the present 
generation of young men, however, they are in advance of their predecessors on 
this subject, as a resolution to the effect that the university ought immediately 
to admit women to its degrees was carried by 147 votes for to 55 against. The 
mover of the resolution was the son of a lady who herself came out, some 
twenty-three years ago, at the very head of the list in classical honors. The 
Jady senior classic, then Miss Agnata Ramsay, married Doctor Butler, master 
of Trinity, and it is their son, Mr. J. R. M. Butler, who moved the resolution in 
favor of giving women degrees—a charming tribute on his part to his learned 
mother.® 
The board of Trinity College, Dublin, has elected a woman, Miss 
Constantia Elizabeth Maxwell, to be an assistant to the professor of 
modern history. Miss Maxwell is the first woman who has become a 
member of the teaching staff of Trinity College since its foundation. 
At the meeting of the Association for Maintaining the American 
Women’s Table at the Naples Zoological Station, held April 24, 1909, 
at the American Museum of Natural History, Miss Caroline McGill, 
of the University of Missouri, was appointed a scholar of the asso- 
ciation for research at the Naples station. The award of the prize of 
$1,000 offered every year for the best thesis written by a woman on a 
scientific subject embodying an independent laboratory research in 
biological, chemical, or physical science was made to Miss Florence 
Buchanan, D. Sc. of London University, fellow of University College, 
London, for a thesis entitled “ The time taken in the transmission of 
reflex impulses in the spinal cord of the frog.” Miss Buchanan has 
been engaged in research work at the University Museum, Oxford, 
since 1896, and has published 16 papers. It is worthy of remark 
that, of the 11 theses presented in competition, 5 were sent from Eng- 
land and 1 from Canada. The subjects of 4 were morphological, 
2 bacteriological, 2 zoological, 1 physiological, 1 was in the domain 
of physical chemistry, and 1 in parasitology. The general average 
of these investigations was very high, distinctly above those of the 
three previous competitions. A fifth prize will be offered in 1911.

XV. INTERNATIONAL CONGRESSES. 
THIRD INTERNATIONAL ART CONGRESS. 
The Third International Art Congress for the Development of 
Drawing and Art Teaching and their Application to Industries con- 
vened at London August 3-8, 1908. The following statements as to 
the sessions and scope of the Congress are taken from the published 
transactions: 
The full sessions of the congress were held in the Great Hall of the University 
of London, South Kensington. Sectional meetings were held and special lec- 
tures given in the lecture theaters of the Victoria and Albert Museum and the 
Royal College of Science. The international congress exhibition was housed 
partly in the Royal College of Art and partly in the reconstructed galleries of 
the Victoria and Albert Museum, kindly placed at the disposal of the British 
committee by the board of education. 
The growth of the congress affords striking testimony of the increasing ap- 
preciation of the importance of its aims and its work. At Paris—where the 
first congress was held in 1900—there were 30 delegates and 516 members from 
15 different countries. The second congress at Berne in 1904 was attended by 
172 delegates and 823 members (including associate members) from 21 coun- 
tries. The third congress had a membership of no less than 1,819, including 
299 delegates, of whom 74 were officially appointed by their respective govern- 
ments, and no fewer than 38 countries were represented. The congress exhibi- 
tion covered more than 60,000 square feet of wall space and showed the work 
of 21 nations. Exhibits were sent from countries as far distant as Australia, 
Mexico, and Newfoundland. An exhibit was promised from Siam, but at the 
Jast moment it was not found possible to dispatch it in time. To the regret of 
many, Italy, Japan, and Russia were unrepresented at the exhibition for various 
reasons. Exhibits from these countries will be looked forward to with interest 
at the next Congress. * * * 
The subjects for discussion at the congress were determined by the inter- 
national federation. They were as follows: 
(1) Drawing in conjunction with modeling and manual work. 
(2) The teaching of drawing in the professions; its definite inclusion in the 
university curriculum. 
(3) The training of art teachers. 
(4) The organization of professional art training. 
(5) Schemes of apprenticeship and scholarship. Progress made since the 
last congress. 
(6) Unification of signs and symbols in mechanical drawing. 
(7) Methods of disseminating ideas in art and of developing public taste. 
(8) International codification of terms used in the teaching of drawing. 
(9) Experiments made toward establishing methods of teaching young chil- 
dren adapted to their nature and capacity. iN 
The United States had above 200 representatives at the congress, 
including two members, Mr. Henry Turner Bailey, of Massachusetts,
-P-A-G-E-200
    
188 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
and Mr. Charles M. Carter, of Denver, Colo., accredited as national 
delegates. 
In a report on the professional aspect of the congress, comparing 
the impressions made by the presentation of art instruction in this 
country and in European countries, Mr. Bailey says: 
In the matter of elementary art education we have led and still lead the 
world. Some of the problems we solved long ago our friends across the water 
are still discussing; certain principles with us well established, they still hold 
as experimental. In equipment, both for actual work and for training the taste 
through schoolroom decoration, in flexible and comprehensive courses, in the 
free use of drawing for illustrative purposes, in originality and spontaneity of 
result, and, perhaps most notably, in the teaching of color, the United States is 
conceded by all to stand first. In the work of the secondary schools and more, 
advanced institutions our results do not appear to such advantage. The reason, 
I believe, is not far to seek. We have a different ideal, an ideal demanding 
more time for ripening its fruit. It is comparatively easy to secure mere 
technical finish, by aiming at that alone, to hold a boy who has never tasted of 
freedom, who knows nothing of the joys of free expression, of original design, 
to the painstaking production of a finished drawing after the manner of his 
fathers. It is quite another thing to fire a boy with the passion to think for 
himself, to see for himself, to express himself frankly and fearlessly in his own 
way—the very tap root of fine art—and to lead him to perfect his own technique. 
Our friends abroad lament our failure to secure good technique, but are in 
open revolt against their own traditions and conventional standards by which 
such technique has been secured. They envy us our freedom, our dash, our 
originality, but warn us against the methods by which we have retained these 
qualities in our work. Our ideals—thought, first, technique later; originality, 
not mimicry ; personality, not conventionality ; the child first, his expression as a 
natural consequence—will give to our advanced work, one of these days, 
qualities which will place it in the very forefront of advanced art educational 
achievement. 
Mr. Leslie W. Miller, principal of the Pennsylvania Museum 
School of Industrial Art, Philadelphia, says: 
Observers from this side are apparently pretty well agreed upon certain 
points that the congress, with its attendant exhibition, gave them a chance to 
observe. First of all, our observers are agreed that drawing, as such, is much 
bétter taught over there than it is with us. We do a good deal of hemming 
and hawing, and have a lot to say about the things that the study may be made 
to stand for and suggest, and all that, but we are all agreed that pupils of the 
same age draw a great deal better in the European schools than they do in ours. 
Second, we note that comparisons between the work of our high schools and that 
done by pupils of the same age over there are hardly fair, for the reason that 
they do not have in Europe high schools to teach everything to everybody, as 
we do, and that the work which they have to show over there is that of picked 
pupils, who go to schools that are devoted to technical aims, where a great deal 
more attention is paid to drawing than we give to it here. Third, we get 
all the comfort we can out of the fact that in America everything we have, 
such as it is, is for the benefit of everybody, without regard to class or capacity, 
and that along with our teaching of the subject goes a lot of work that possesses 
distinct value in the way of esthetic culture and general knowledge, which is,
-P-A-G-E-201

we believe, quite as important in the long run as any direct results in purely 
disciplinary work would be likely to be. * * * 
In the very elementary grades our work is excellent, but the elementary 
flavor persists entirely too long. Higher up in the grades our standards too 
often go to pieces and drawing fails to keep the place that we claim for it 
among the things that are to be taken more seriously as essentials in all 
general education. 
We need, I think, to insist more on the disciplinary element in drawing, which 
we are, just now, a good deal inclined to fight shy of through a dread of becom- 
ing “mechanical.” It is just because it is so close in spirit to mathematics that 
it is valuable as a means of discipline. Our drawing should be definite and 
exact, which means that it should make the utmost use of exercises that admit 
of having their rightness or wrongness demonstrable.?    
       
                                                      
   
   
   
   
   
    
       Mr. Carter notes as one of the most interesting discussions of the 
congress that on the earlier stages of art instruction. Among those 
who presented papers in this section were Doctor Kerschensteiner, of 
Munich, who has devoted several years to exhaustive study of the 
drawings of children. Mr. Carter cites the following conclusions em- 
bodied in the paper referred to: 
In the primary schools, at least, boys and girls require a different syllabus. 
Brush work should be preferred to all other technique in decoration drawing. 
As a rule drawing from nature can not be successfully taught in class before 
the age of 10. 
Where the systematic class teaching is begun at an early age it is desirable 
to organize it exclusively as drawing from memory following class discussion. 
Drawing from good copies should have no place in class work, but it may be 
unreservedly recommended for home work. 
Mr. E. Cooke, representing the Teachers’ Guild of England, who 
has given great attention to the same subject, differed from Doctor 
Kerschensteiner in several particulars. Mr. Cooke said in part: 
I want to say a word or two about the suggestion that Doctor Kerschensteiner 
made. We are working on much the same lines, but we have not come to 
exactly the same conclusions, and I should like to say a word or two about the 
conclusions to which he has come. First of all he suggested that in primary 
schools, at least, boys and girls require a different syllabus. I think not. I 
have neyer seen any reason why the girls and boys should have different 
treatment, either for drawing or anything else. I do not agree with that, al- 
though I agree with nearly all but that. He said next that “decorative draw- 
ing should only be eliminated from the curriculum of the primary schools whose 
teaching staff show no artistic taste; the children themselves are invariably 
ripe for such exercise.” I think he is right about the children, but it should 
not be eliminated from any school. Children ought not to draw plants first. 
They should learn something of the shape of the lines and forms of which the 
plants are composed, and put these lines and forms in order. Order is the basis 
iof decorative design, and every teacher in every primary school is able to do that. 
Then Doctor Kerschensteiner said that brush work should be preferred to all 
lother technique in decorative drawing. What does he understand by brush 
ork? The word has been confused intentionally in this country. It should 
efer especially to the powers of the brush itself. Drawing with the brush is

-P-A-G-E-202
    
190 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
not brush work. Brush work is the analysis and exercise of the peculiar powers 
of the brush, especially for design. The elements of brush drawing are, I 
suppose, “brush work.” * * * 
Doctor Kerschensteiner said that as a rule drawing from nature can not be 
successfully taught in class before the age of 10. That is a very difficult point. 
In London children do not get much communication with nature itself, and, 
though I agree with Doctor Kerschensteiner that to begin drawing from nature 
is not according to the natural development of the child and may be injurious, 
I think that children in London enjoy that drawing so much that I hesitate to 
say it is wrong, if the teacher is a motherly woman who takes what the children 
can give without insisting on accuracy. There are teachers of that kind in the 
London County council schools. 
Then Doctor Kerschensteiner said that where the systematic class teaching 
of drawing is begun at an early age it is desirable to organize it exclusively as 
drawing from memory following class discussion. There, again, I am inclined 
to differ from Doctor Kerschensteiner. Much of it should be drawing from 
memory or imagination, or from the child’s own knowledge, but systematic help 
to the child may be given in the way which I suggested the other day. The 
child begins with its own scribble when it has hardly any ideas at all and 
evolves form. I think, and I am sure Doctor Kerschensteiner will agree with 
me, that to follow the development of the child we must find it out first. To 
follow its development is far more important than drawing from nature. 
The resolution finally adopted by the congress regarding art educa- 
tion of the young “ embodied in part,” says Mr. Carter, the follow- 
ing: 
Guard the child’s sensibility, make drawing an aid in developing all faculties. 
Subjects should be chosen from nature, familiar objects, and incidents of child 
life. They should encourage careful and orderly work, demanding some judg- 
ment, as opposed to mere mechanical copies. All illustration and objects of 
study should be on a large scale easily seen by all pupils. 
The theory and practice of teaching as applied to art should be especially 
studied by teachers. 
An important permanent outcome of this congress is the literature 
to which it gave rise. This includes: The Transactions of the Con- 
gress, edited by C. Myles Mathews; A Conspectus of Art Education 
in the United States (illustrated), edited by Dr. James P. Haney; 
and an Illustrated Handbook to the Exhibition, edited by Keighley 
Snowden.* 
FIFTH INTERNATIONAL DENTAL CONGRESS. 
The Fifth International Dental Congress met at Berlin from the 
23d to the 28th of August, 1909. The invitation sent out by the or- 
ganizing committee stated that the meeting would celebrate the 
fiftieth anniversary of the Central Society of German Dentists, and 
that plans had been made to demonstrate by lectures and discussions 
at meetings and by an international dental exhibition the develop- 
ment of dentistry in recent years.

FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON DOMESTIC SCIENCE AND 
ARTS. 
The First International Congress on Domestic Science and Arts 
was held at Fribourg, Switzerland, September 29 and 30, 1908. The 
preparations for the congress had been carried on with great energy 
by the committee who inaugurated the enterprise,* and with such 
success that the participation of nearly 700 members was secured. 
The programme was exceedingly comprehensive, no less than 72 
papers having been accepted for consideration at the sessions of the 
congress. Fortunately printed copies of these had been circulated, 
so that discussion was limited to the principal points in each. The 
value of the congress consisted chiefly in the opportunity it afforded 
for bringing together accounts of what has already been done in dif- 
ferent countries in respect to the training of women for duties of 
domestic and social life. For the first time it was possible to take a 
comprehensive survey of the systems developed in the countries that 
have taken the lead in this matter. From the information collected 
it is possible to recognize three distinct systems of training in do- 
mestic science and arts: The German, the Belgian, and the Swiss. 
While these systems are very similar, it was agreed that the Germans 
have the most highly elaborated programme; the Belgians have shown 
great skill in combining theoretic and practical training, and so 
shortening the period of instruction; the Swiss excel in the system 
of training teachers for this specialty. Great interest was excited 
by the examination of the normal schools of Fribourg, Berne, and 
Zurich, in which the training of teachers of domestic science and 
household industries is conducted in a truly scientific manner. 
The most prominent questions before the congress were, first, as to 
the general diffusion of instruction in domestic science and industry ; 
second, the organization of special classes or school for a complete 
system of instruction in the subject considered; third, the training of 
teachers for this specialty. 
In regard to the first question, opinion was general that since the 
majority of girls can not continue their studies beyond the primary ‘ 
schools, it is important to introduce domestic arts into the elementary- 
school course, and for this reason they should be included also in the 
course of every normal school. 
The chief interest of the congress, however, centered in the question 
of the organization of a complete course of instruction in domestic 
science and the management of a home with all its varied demands. 
The wide scope given to this subject indicated that nothing less was 
purposed than the elaboration of a complete system of special educa-   
   «The committee consisted of M. Python, president of the state council of Fribourg; 
Mme. de Gottrau-Watteville, Mme. Coradi-Stahl, and M. Jean Brunhes

tion for women. The programme approved by the congress for such 
a complete course of instruction includes the subjects here enumerated 
in the order of their importance: 
First. The selection and preparation of food, including the study 
of prices, nutritive value, advantages of a vegetable diet, the utiliza- 
tion of garden products, and the management of a kitchen garden in 
the country. 
Second. Clothing, including study of fabrics, cutting and fitting 
garments, and drawing, design and harmony of colors as auxiliary 
branches. 
Third. Principles and application of natural sciences, physics, and 
chemistry, as related to food; physiology and hygiene in their relation 
to health and healthful living. 
Fourth. The care of children from infancy to the sixth year, having 
equal regard to their physical and moral natures. 
In order to make the instruction effective, it was urged that every 
school of the class proposed should include a fully equipped practice 
department. 
The congress agreed that passing beyond the exclusive circle of 
home, the course of instruction outlined should include the general 
relations and the social services of which the family is the center. 
Among the latter were mentioned, in particular, the three great evils 
that afflict society—alcoholism, tuberculosis, and infant mortality. 
The system of instruction advocated by the congress would require 
a certain maturity of mind for its mastery, hence it belongs to the 
stage of secondary or professional education. 
In the closing session of the congress a resolution was adopted pro- 
viding for the establishment of a permanent international committee 
to collect and distribute information relative to instruction in domes- 
tic science and arts. The central office of the committee will be in 
Switzerland, at some place to be determined. 
FIFTH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON ESPERANTO.    
The Fifth International Congress on Esperanto was held at Barce- 
lona, Spain, September 5 to 11 of the current year. Mr. Herbert 
Harris and Mr. Edwin C. Reed were accredited as official delegates 
from the United States. It may be noted in this connection that the 
First Pan-American Scientific Congress, held at Santiago, Chile, 
December, 1908, adopted a resolution strongly approving the use of 
the Esperanto language for international intercourse. Preceded by a 
preamble expressing the views of the congress as to the importance 
of this medium, the resolutions adopted were as follows: 
(1) The First Pan-American Scientific Congress decides to express to the 
American governments the pleasure with which it would view the call for a 
congress to which would come official representatives of all civilized countries,
-P-A-G-E-205
  INTERNATIONAL CONGRESSES, 193 
with the purpose of solving the problem of the adoption of a neutral inter- 
national auxiliary idiom; and 
(2) It agrees to urge upon the Government of the United States of North 
America that, under its grand auspices, this desire of the scientific congress 
may be effected. 
INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON THE TEACHING OF MODERN 
LANGUAGES. 
Among congresses affording special opportunity for the inter- 
change of opinions and experiences on the part of professors of the 
same subject in different countries should be mentioned the Inter- 
national Congress on the Teaching of Modern Languages, organized 
by the Society of Professors of Modern Languages in France, and 
convened at the Sorbonne, April 14-17, 1909. The importance of the 
subject was particularly emphasized by the recognition accorded the 
congress by the French Government. It was placed under the direct 
auspices of the minister of commerce and the minister of public 
instruction, and the director of secondary education in the ministry 
of public instruction and the vice-rector of the Academy of Paris 
gave active support to the preliminary arrangements. All the lead- 
ing European countries had large representation in the membership ; 
naturally the delegation from the United States was small, but the 
presence of Prof. C. H. C. Wright, of Harvard University, who had 
been appointed as a national delegate from this country, was an evi- 
dence that the importance of the subject is appreciated by ourselves. 
The report of the proceedings of the congress has not yet been 
issued, but from fragmentary accounts in current journals it appears 
that while the various topics appointed for consideration were treated 
mainly from the standpoint of French professors, there was practical 
agreement on the part of all the delegates that instruction in modern 
languages might be so organized and conducted as to afford a mental 
discipline equivalent to that attained by the study of the classical 
languages. At the same time it was conceded that under present 
conditions this equivalent has not been reached. It remains for the 
professors of modern languages in the different countries to apply 
themselves to the problem of developing the educational resources of 
the subject upon which they are engaged. It was urged that, in addi- 
tion to the study of the grammar of the respective languages and the 
practice that gives facility in writing and speaking the same, the 
course of study should be extended to include a systematic and pro- 
found study of the history, customs, and manners of the peoples 
themselves. The proceedings of the congress have given a great im- 
pulse to the discussion of the conduct of modern-language courses in 
the principal countries of Europe, and the interést thus created will 
doubtless be greatly increased by the full report of the proceedings.

194 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
FIRST INTERNATIONAL MORAL EDUCATION CONGRESS. 
The First International Moral Education Congress was held at the 
University of London September 25-29, 1908. The widespread in- 
terest excited in the preparations for this congress and the stimu- 
lating effect that it has had upon educational leaders in Europe and 
America justify a somewhat extended reference to the circumstances 
that gave rise to it. These are briefly set forth in the historical 
introduction to the record of the proceedings of the congress,* as 
follows: 
In 1905 a new Italian education code was published, laying the utmost stress 
on moral education and making detailed regulations with regard to moral in- 
struction. In the following year a new Hungarian education code was issued, 
which is even more emphatic and detailed in its references to moral education. 
In 1905 a new Austrian education code came to light, containing a large num- 
ber of references to moral education. In Portugal an excellent manual of 
moral instruction for primary schools, as distinct from religious instruction, 
was Officially published in 1906 and approved by the Cardinal of Lisbon (Com- 
pendio de Moral e Doutrina Christa, by Conego Manuel Anaguim, Lisbon; 
Livraria Ferreira). In the United States schemes of moral instruction have 
been elaborated in many places. In Germany the most recent reading books 
for elementary schools contain abundance of ethical matter. In Switzerland 
several cantons have taken distinct steps in the direction of drawing up moral 
instruction programmes. In Belgium excellent moral instruction syllabuses 
for primary schools and for training colleges exist. In France and Japan, 
where moral instruction has already been introduced, the subject is being 
studied with redoubled interest. In Russia the authorities are turning their 
attention to this subject, and finally, in England the code of the board of edu- 
cation for 1906 stated that “ moral instruction should form an important part 
of every school curriculum.” It is, therefore, not astonishing that 21 govern- 
ments were represented and that nearly 30 governments assisted the congress 
in one way or another. 
While these preparations were in progress the subject of moral 
education was earnestly discussed and societies were formed in many 
countries for the express purpose of stimulating action in this par- 
ticular. Among these may be named the moral instruction leagues 
of England and Germany. The initiative with reference to holding 
a moral instruction congress was taken by the International Union 
of Ethical Societies at its conference held in July, 1906, at Eisenach. 
It was this conference also that gave rise to the international inquiry 
into moral instruction and training, the conclusions of which were 
published under the editorial supervision of Professor Sadler.? 
The preparations for the congress were vigorously pushed by the 
executive committee, with the result that auxiliary committees were 
formed in all the principal countries of the world and 21 countries 
were officially or semiofficially represented in the membership.

INTERNATIONAL CONGRESSES. 195 
A great service was rendered by the congress in thus bringing 
together in one comprehensive view statements of the present state 
of moral education in the countries represented in the congress and 
unfolding the subject in all its varied aspects. Permanent value 
was imparted to the proceedings by the publication of the papers 
that had been prepared with great care, and which were ready for 
distribution in printed form when the congress convened. Not less 
than 2,000 copies of the published papers were disposed of within 
four weeks after the congress met. 
In a memorandum prepared for the record of the proceedings of 
the congress, Prof. J. H. Muirhead, of the University of Birmingham, 
sums up his general impressions of the congress. Professor Muir- 
head notes in particular: 
(1) The “common agreement that in the formation of character 
we come in view of the true end of all instruction and training. Not 
in what children are taught, the information and dexterities they 
acquire, but in the use they are taught to make of them must we 
look for the standard and test of all systems of education. Going 
along with this was a cheering impression of the great amount of 
solid achievement, of which the facts reported from many countries 
told.” 
(2) The distinctive recognition of the fact that as a means of 
moral education “the school is only a part and at the best a very 
small part.” Hence, “the extension of the leaving age and the co- 
operation of all religious and other educational agencies in continuing 
and solidifying the school teacher’s work are alone adequate to the 
situation.” 
(8) The difference that “emerged on the subject of the relation 
between moral and religious education.” The discussion, he says, 
occupied a central place, and the congress will be memorable for the oppor- 
tunity it gave of having the two great ideals of education, which for the last 
century have slowly been recognizing each other as mortal foes, clearly set 
forth in amicable public discussion by some of the ablest of their respective 
supporters. There was a dramatic element in the session which added to the 
sharpness of the antithesis. For the first half of the time it seemed as though 
the deepest issue would be confined to differences in doctrinal emphasis and in 
pedagogical methods. The wider question was first broached by M. Ferdinand 
Buisson, of Paris, who, in a short, courageous paper, made it clear that the 
leading French educationists had long ceased to regard religion as any part of 
the content of moral education, or as having any vital relation to it. Religion 
is to receive a formal acknowledgment. Children must be taught “the respect 
due to the idea of religion, and the tolerance due to all its forms without excep- 
tion.” But for the rest they are to be taught that “the chief mode of knowing 
God consists in each doing his duty according to his conscience and his reason.” 
After M. Buisson’s speech everyone present seemed to feel that in the conflict 
of ideals he had succeeded in indicating the whole problem of modern education 
was contained as in a nutshell; all other conflicts were trivial in comparison. 
 
-P-A-G-E-208
    
196 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
It was not that the supporters of each of these ideals did not know before of 
the existence of the other, but that the authority and sincerity with which the 
speeches were delivered on both sides, the touch of personal conviction in men 
of international reputation, arrested attention, and gave a depth and a meaning 
to the several contentions which they had not before possessed. On the one 
side—which, for want of a better name, may be called the “ positivist ’—there 
was the emphasis on the concrete; the connection of conduct with social, indus- 
trial, civic, and political well-being. In character lie the issues of life for indi- 
vidual communities and humanity at large. Along with this went an uncom- 
promising claim for freedom of conscience and an insistence on intellectual 
sincerity as the very fountain head of moral rectitude and integrity of character. 
No individual or society can for long undervalue veracity and continue to count 
as a member of a spiritual community. As compared with the interests here 
involved, theologies and doctrinal differences, if advocated in themselves, are 
as unsubstantial shadows, while if they are turned, as too commonly they are, 
into a ground of intolerance and superstition—or, worse still, of acquiescence 
in existing social conditions—they are the most serious obstacle against which 
progressive forces have to contend. 
Just here the other side made itself heard. These defects, it was maintained, 
are an accident of particular forms of religion. What religion stands for is 
not a particular system of dogma or discipline, but a claim for the inwardness of 
morality—for the recognition of the eternal distinction between the natural 
and the spiritual, and, going along with this, of the reality of sin and the 
necessity of rising, through a grace which is not our own, from what is at the 
best mere natural goodness of heart to a vivid sense of the demand that our 
souls’ deeper attachments make upon us. True, this implies the belief in the 
reality of these attachments; but this is itself part of the witness of conscious- 
ness. It is popularly called “faith in God,” but its essence is not the belief in 
anything supernatural and transcendental, but the sense of a wider fellowship 
than that represented by any individual society, or even group or succession 
of societies upon this planet—the conviction that, in ways we are far from com- 
pletely understanding, the real underlying forces of the world are on the side 
of our best aspirations, that the ideal is the real, and is most real where it is 
most true to itself as an ideal. Nor is this faith mere matter of speculation 
without effect on moral conduct. It is true that the connection is often misrep- 
resented. It is put on a false footing, and the faith itself compromised and 
forfeited, rather than fortified, by the advocacy of those who seek in it a super- 
natural sanction for moral conduct. But this ought not to prejudice us against 
religion, or blind us to the real influence which it has in purifying and refining 
character and in furnishing the natural breath of spiritual graces—humility, 
fortitude, resignation, hope, trust, joy—which live with difficulty in the more 
rarefied atmosphere of positivist belief. 
Are these two beliefs incompatible? 
In reply to his own inquiry Professor Muirhead continues: 
This was the question that was inevitably suggested by what all who were 
present recognized as a remarkable meeting. What was further remarkable, 
and was at the time noticed by some of the speakers, was that the answer to 
it was already hinted at in the very terms in which it was set. It was seen 
that neither ideal could really afford to ignore or repudiate the other, and that 
the hope of the future lay in a synthesis that should comprehend them both, 
and not merely compromise and compound between them.®

  INTERNATIONAL CONGRESSES. 197 
SIXTH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF PSYCHOLOGISTS. 
This meeting took place in Geneva, Switzerland, August 3-7, 1909. 
The greatest number of participants were of those who represent 
the science of physiological psychology, but while in Rome, 1905, at 
the occasion of the fifth congress, as many as 282 papers on the sub- 
ject of physiological psychology had been placed on the programme, 
the programme of the sixth congress announced only 40. The 
Danish philosopher, Professor Héffding, caused the most profound 
discussion with his paper on the psychology of religious phenomena. 
Professor Thiéry, of Louvain, and Professor Nagel, of Rostock, 
reported on the attempts at standardizing colors, which report is 
regarded epoch making, though Professor Asher, of Berne, opposed 
the recommendations of the two savants. A committee was ap- 
pointed for further investigations and report. It consists of Pro- 
fessors Nagel, of Rostock; Asher, of Berne; Thiéry, of Louvain; 
Larquier des Bancels, of Lausanne; and R. M. Yerkes, of Columbia. 
Attempts were made at agreeing upon uniform definitions to be 
used in psychology ; especially such German terms as “ Empfindung ” 
and “ Gefiihle,” which are rarely distinguished in common language, 
caused much trouble. Professor Kiilpe, of Bonn, read a paper on 
Gefiihle (emotions). Prof. Jacques Loeb, of the University of Cali- 
fornia, spoke on tropisms and their importance for psychology. He 
claimed that psychological phenomena could be traced to physical 
and chemical laws. He found much opposition to his materialistic 
view of soul life. The science of esthetics was represented only by 
one paper, on rhythmical gymnastics. 
THE PAN-AMERICAN SCIENTIFIC CONGRESS. 
The Pan-American Scientific Congress was held in Santiago, Chile, 
from December 25, 1908, to January 5, 1909. Twelve American uni- 
versities and three national scientific associations were represented 
in the congress in addition to the official delegation sent by the Gov- 
ernment of the United States.* 
The general character of the topics considered is illustrated by the 
following statement quoted from a report of the congress by Dr. L. 8. 
Rowe,’ chairman of the delegation from the United States.   
«The delegates of the United States to the Pan-American Scientific Congress were: 
Prof. L. 8S. Rowe, chairman, University of Pennsylvania; Prof. Thomas Barbour, Harvard 
University ; Prof. Hiram Bingham, Yale University ; Prof. Webster E. Browning, Princeton 
University ; Prof. Archibald C. Coolidge, Harvard University; Prof. H. D. Curtis, Cornell 
University ; Col. William C. Gorgas, Isthmian Canal Commission; Prof. Christopher W. 
Hall, University of Minnesota; Prof. Adolph Hempel, University of Illinois; Mr. W. H. 
Holmes, Bureau of Ethnology, Smithsonian Institution; Prof. J. Laurence Laughlin, 
University of Chicago; Prof. Albert A. Michelson, University of Chicago; Prof. Bernard 
Moses, University of California; Prof. Paul S. Reinsch, University of Wisconsin; Prof. 
W. F. Rice, Northwestern University ; Mr. George M. Rommel, Bureau of Animal Industry, 
Department of Agriculture; Prof. William R. Shepherd, Columbia University; Prof. 
William B. Smith, Tulane University ; Prof. Jay Backus Woodworth, Harvard University.

-P-A-G-E-210
  198 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
Doctor Rowe says: 
In the social science, educational, and agricultural sections (three of the 
nine into which the congress was divided) the main subjects discussed were: 
(1) International law; (2) financial and monetary problems; (8) educational 
problems; (4) economic, social, and political problems; and (5) improvement 
of agricultural methods. 
In the same report Doctor Rowe calls attention to the distinction— 
between the scientific congresses and the Pan-American diplomatic conference 
which last assembled in Rio Janeiro in 1906, and which will next meet in Buenos 
Aires in 1910. These scientific congresses possess one advantage over the diplo- 
matic conferences because of the possibility of a full and free interchange of 
opinion, untrammeled by diplomatic instructions or political considerations. 
Although the conclusions reached do not take the form of treaties and conven- 
tions, they possess the merit of expressing accurately the ripe judgment and the 
most advanced thought on the important problems confronting the republics of 
this hemisphere. Viewed in another light, these congresses mark the successive 
steps in the formation of a continental public opinion. The united and defi- 
nitely formulated views of the American republics on questions affecting the 
welfare of the continents must command universal respect. 
It was the good fortune of many of the delegates from the United States 
to visit Uruguay and the Argentine Republic on their way to or from Santiago. 
Not only was the traditional Latin-American hospitality shown them, but they 
were received with an enthusiasm so real and spontaneous as to leave a lasting 
impression on every member of the delegation. Far mere important and sig- 
nificant than the cordiality of this reception was the universal desire to be 
brought into touch with scientific and educational activities in the United States. 
All the countries of Latin America have received, and still receive, their intel- 
lectual stimulus and educational inspiration either from France or Germany. 
There is a growing feeling, however, that the lessons of educational experience 
in the United States contain much of value and profit for the people of Latin 
America. While in Uruguay, the Argentine, and Chile, the delegates from the 
United States were constantly questioned with reference to our educational 
organization, and advice and suggestion requested as to the plan best adapted 
to introduce American methods into their systems. * * * 
The Santiago congress also served to demonstrate that in all the countries 
of Latin America careful scientific research is being conducted in all the higher 
institutions of learning, and that this research is being directed primarily to 
the solution of the distinctively national problems. Probably the most vivid 
impression carried away by the delegates from the United States was the fact 
that in every Latin-American country there is a group of serious students will- 
ing and even anxious to cooperate with their colleagues in the United States in 
the investigation of problems affecting the welfare of the people of this hemi- 
sphere. Every delegate from the United States returned with a better appre- 
ciation of the significance of the Latin-American civilization and of the mutual 
services which the culture of the North and South may render each other. 
INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON TUBERCULOSIS. 
Among the topics discussed at the International Congress on Tuber- 
culosis, which met at Washington on September 28, 1908, two may 
be noticed here as showing the steps taken in our colleges and schools 
in relation to the disease,
-P-A-G-E-211
  INTERNATIONAL CONGRESSES. 199 
The first is a paper by Prof. W. H. Norton, of Cornell College, 
Iowa, with the title “The colleges of the United States and the 
campaign against tuberculosis,” in which the author describes the 
instruction given at higher institutions in regard to tuberculosis in 
connection with hygiene or social economics. As illustrations he 
cites (1) Columbia University, where in 1908 an entire term was 
devoted to seminar work on the social aspects and control of this 
disease; (2) the investigations of Professors Fisher, Bailey, and 
Farnham, of Yale, on the relation of tuberculosis to labor and tene- 
ment conditions; (3) the sociological work at the University of 
Chicago, where students accompany the patients of the college dis- 
pensary to their homes, and study local conditions and surroundings 
and the methods employed in improving the environment; and (4) 
the work of the University of Wisconsin, whose classes from the 
departments of political economy and sociology visit Milwaukee to 
study the social and industrial aspects of the disease. In-many 
colleges the students are securing data as to the prevalence of the 
disease. 
From answers to a questionnaire sent to 200 representative higher schools 
of the United States it is found that about one-fifth are engaged in investi- 
gative work in tuberculosis. 
Colleges also furnish lecturers to inform the people of the danger 
of the disease and the way to combat it. University-extension lec- 
tures on tuberculosis are now offered by at least 15 colleges and 
universities. In some colleges tests are made of the air to detect bac- 
teria, and where these are found in too great quantity the rooms are 
disinfected with formaldehyde. In some colleges the students are 
prohibited from rooming in families afflicted with tuberculosis, and 
others have a regular inspection of dairy herds which supply milk 
for their boarding halls. Special lectures on tuberculosis are given 
before student assemblies in about one-fifth of the 200 representative 
colleges, while regular class-room instruction is provided in many 
colleges on the causes, results, and prevention of the disease. This 
is in addition to the propaganda carried on in the special depart- 
ments of biology and hygiene, sociology, domestic science, sanitary 
engineering, and economics. (The paper is given in full in Science 
for July 2, 1909.) 
The other paper referred to was presented by Luther H. Gulick, 
M. D., director of physical training for the public schools of the 
city of New York, and has for its title “ Tuberculosis and the public 
schools.” Doctor Gulick mentions four steps to be taken in protect- 
ing the schools from the disease. They are, first, the detection of 
tuberculosis among the pupils, which must be effected by a more 
thorough medical inspection than the perfunctory examination now 
 
-P-A-G-E-212
    200, EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
usually made; second, the detection of tuberculosis among teachers 
and prospective teachers. In a large number of American cities, he 
says, principally in the West, persons having tuberculosis are not 
allowed to teach in the public schools; and here also the detection of 
the disease depends upon the thoroughness of the medical examina- 
tion, which sometimes is performed carefully while in other cases 
it is not. 
The presence of tuberculosis among teachers must be regarded as of the 
utmost danger to the community—of more danger than is the presence of tuber- 
culosis in any other class of persons, for they, even with the utmost care as 
to the disposal of sputum, will cough in the air, and so expose every pupil in 
the room to contagion. 
The third step advocated by Doctor Gulick is the instruction of 
the pupils themselves “with reference to the fundamental facts 
regarding tuberculosis.” This is to be effected by giving instruction, 
at first, in individual hygiene in such a manner that the pupils will 
understand and remember it, and later in the course the instruction 
should include personal, social, and community hygiene. The in- 
struction relating to tuberculosis would form part of the course in 
physiology and hygiene which, in accordance with the legal require- 
ments of the several States, extends practically through all the years 
of the school life. It will begin with simple facts within the child’s 
knowledge and be gradually extended from year to year, inculcating 
cleanly and healthful habits, until it ends with including public 
hygiene—the purity of waters, the cleanliness of streets and build- 
ings, and the lighting, heating, and ventilation of rooms. 
The fourth step in the preventive propaganda suggested by Doctor 
Gulick is the instruction of prospective teachers with regard to 
tuberculosis, in which, he adds, they are at present inadequately 
instructed at the normal schools. 
Besides these four specific or direct attacks upon tuberculosis, 
Doctor Gulick suggests other indirect means of preventing the spread 
of the disease, which he discusses under the heads of ventilation, 
exercise, playgrounds and playtime, and dust-free school buildings. 
FUTURE CONGRESSES. 
Among the congresses announced for the coming year (1910) are: 
The Third International Congress on Home Education, to be held 
in Brussels, 1910, in connection with the universal exposition. At 
the request of the Belgian Government an American committee has 
been formed to cooperate with the organizing committee in Belgium 
in the preliminary plans for the congress. Prof. M. V. O’Shea, of 
the University of Wisconsin, has consented to act as chairman of
-P-A-G-E-213
    INTERNATIONAL CONGRESSES. 201 
the American committee, a service which he rendered, also, in prep- 
aration for the first congress of the series, which was held at Liége 
in 1905. 
The International Congress on Administrative Sciences.—This 
Government has been notified that an international congress for the 
discussion of administrative sciences will meet July 28-31, during 
the exposition of 1910 at Brussels, under the patronage of the Bel- 
gian Government, the Belgian minister of the interior being the hon- 
orary president of the congress, while the other ministers of state 
will represent their respective departments in furthering its objects. 
The circular issued by the organizing committee of the congress 
recites that the conception of the functions of public administration 
has completely changed within the last few decades. The general 
governments of the various countries and their subordinate divisions, 
particularly the cities and communes, have undertaken new duties 
and responsibilities which are constantly increasing and becoming 
more complicated and delicate. Hence, the attention which is being 
given to administration as a science by savants as well as by men of 
affairs has increased to such an extent that in many countries the 
universities have established special faculties of political and admin- 
istrative sciences to give formal instruction in these branches, while 
cities give exhibits of their methods of conducting municipal affairs 
at expositions, and even the general public now seeks to familiarize 
itself with the principles of administration. It seems to the com- 
mittee, therefore, that the time has come to synthetize this general 
movement in an international congress at which all matters relating 
to public administration, its organization, support, personnel, and 
methods should be discussed and compared. Accordingly, the aim 
of this congress is to bring together all those who, by their position 
or duties, or by the nature of their studies, are especially interested 
in public affairs, and it is hoped that the best administrators of all 
countries will take occasion of the congress to give the results of their 
experience and studies. 
The congress being international, only questions of general inter- 
est affecting the greatest number of countries will be discussed, those 
which concern only some particular country being excluded. 
The five or six volumes of reports of the proceedings of the con- 
gress, which will be published in French, Dutch, English, and Ger- 
man, will afford, it is believed, a very complete and practical com- 
pendium of administrative science. 
Third International Congress on School Hygiene.—In Volume I of 
the report of this bureau for 1907 a report was given of the proceed- 
ings of the Second International Congress on School Hygiene, which 
was held at London August 5 to 10, 1907. The third congress will 
meet at Paris, France, August 2-7, 1910. From the “statute” or  
-P-A-G-E-214
202 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
constitution of the congress it is learned that all persons interested 
in school hygiene may become ordinary members of the congress 
upon payment to the treasurer of the required fee (the equivalent 
of 25 francs).* 
The texts of papers which members propose to read (and this priv- 
ilege is confined to members who have paid their subscriptions) must 
be sent to the general secretary at least two months before the meet- 
ing of the congress, and each should be accompanied by a short 
résumé which can be printed and distributed to members before the 
opening of discussion. Papers should not exceed 2,000 words in 
length and the résumés 300. While the papers presented may be 
written in any European language, preference will be given to 
French, German, and English, and papers written in other languages 
than these should be accompanied by a résumé written in one of 
them. Only those papers will be read at the congress which shall 
have been sent to the general secretary two months previously, and 
they must not have been published elsewhere. 
The congress will be divided into various sections with the usual 
officers as follows: (1) Buildings and school furniture; (2) hygiene 
of residential institutions; (8) medical inspection of schools and the 
individual records, practical results; (4) physical instruction and 
training; (5) hygiene of the school child, prophylaxis of contagious 
diseases at school, school diseases; (6) out of school hygiene, open- 
air schools, vacation colonies, etc.; (7) the teaching staff, its hygiene 
and relation with the homes and school doctors; (8) teaching of 
hygiene to the teachers, scholars, and parents; (9) time-tables and 
methods of education in their relation to school hygiene; (10) special 
schools for abnormal children. 
Standing committees in connection with the congress have been 
formed in the various States of Germany, and in England, Austria- 
Hungary, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cuba, Denmark, the United States, 
Finland, Greece, Italy, Japan, the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg, 
Norway, Sweden, Portugal, Roumania, Russia, and Switzerland, 
while similar committees are in process of formation in Argen- 
tina, Brazil, Chile, Spain, Holland, Mexico, Peru, and Servia. 
From this statement will appear the importance which is attached to

THE RHODES SCHOLARSHIPS—CONCESSION AS TO QUALIFYING 
. EXAMINATION IN GREEK. 
[Copy of letter sent to members of the American committees of selection.] 
Srymour Hovusn, Warertoo Pracs, 
London, S. W., February, 1909. 
Dear Sir: As you are aware, the University of Oxford exacts a 
certain minimum of Greek of all members of the university who in- 
tend to proceed to the ordinary degree. 
Greek has therefore formed one of the subjects for the examina- 
tion, accepted as exempting from responsions, which candidates for 
the Rhodes scholarships are required by the trustees to pass in order 
to become eligible. There is no immediate probability that the de- 
mand of the university in this particular will be changed. It has, 
however, been frequently pointed out that even the small amount of 
Greek required for this qualifying examination prevents a proportion 
of otherwise desirable candidates in the United States from compet- 
ing for the Rhodes scholarships. It is also claimed that some such 
students, who are unwilling to prepare the required Greek on the mere 
chance of getting a scholarship, would willingly do so when once the 
scholarship had been definitely awarded to them. 
The trustees are anxious, as far as possible, to bring the scholar- 
ships within the reach of every student of marked ability. They 
have accordingly decided that any candidate from the United States 
who has passed the qualifying examination in Latin and mathe- 
matics shall be eligible, even though he may not have passed in Greek. 
It must be distinctly understood, however, that Oxford University 
has not changed its requirements. Responsions, or its equivalent 
(and in either case Greek is a necessary subject), must still be passed 
by all who wish to follow the ordinary curriculum. 
American students who pass the Rhodes qualifying examination in 
all three subjects (Latin, Greek, and mathematics) will be in the 
future, as heretofore, exempt from responsions. ‘Those, however, who 
qualify in Latin and mathematics only will be obliged to satisfy the
-P-A-G-E-216
  204. EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
Oxford responsions examiners in Greek before they can offer them- 
selves for any examination which presupposes responsions. 
Moreover, it may be taken as certain that the Oxford colleges which 
accept scholars so selected will expect them to pass the Greek of 
responsions on coming into residence. A responsions examination is 
held at Oxford toward the end of September in each year. Rhodes 
scholars, therefore, who have not passed the qualifying examination 
in Greek should be prepared to come to Oxford in time for this 
examination. As it is expected that hereafter the election of scholars 
will be completed by the end of December in each year, a scholar-elect 
will have nine months in which to master the amount of Greek re- 
quired. Experience has shown that this allows ample time for a 
student of ability. 
This concession is made to meet exceptional cases, but the trustees 
hope that the great majority of candidates will still pass the qualify- 
ing examination as heretofore in all three subjects, since thus the 
scholar will have no further trouble with Greek, but will be at liberty 
to devote the nine months subsequent to his election to subjects more 
germane to the line of study which he proposes to follow at Oxford. 
Believe me, yours, very truly, 
Gro. R. Parkin. 
OXFORD LEGISLATION REGARDING COLUMBIA STUDENTS. 
In a meeting of the convocation of Oxford University held on May 
12, 1908, the following decree with reference to students of Columbia 
University was promulgated : 
1. That any member of Columbia University, New York, who, having satisfied 
the examiners in elementary Greek for admission, shall also have either received 
the grade of B or higher for courses in Greek aggregating at least six points, or 
received the grade of C or higher for courses in Greek aggregating at least ten 
points, shall be deemed to have shown a sufficient knowledge of Greek as re- 
quired by the provisions of Statute II, section 9, “On students from foreign 
universities ” (cl. 11). 
2. That any member of Columbia University, New York, who shall have pur- 
sued at that university a course of study extending over two years at the least, 
and shall have completed at least 72 points toward the degree of bachelor of arts 
or bachelor of science, including all the prescribed subjects, and shall have 
received throughout the grade of C or higher, shall be eligible for admission to 
the status and privileges of a foreign junior student. 
8. That any member of Columbia University, New York, who shall have pur- 
sued at that university a course of study extending over three years at the least, 
and who shall have completed at least 94 points toward the degree of bachelor 
of arts or bachelor of science, including all prescribed work, and shall have 
obtained either (a) third year or final general honors, or (0) the degree of 
bachelor of arts or bachelor of science with final departmental or divisional 
honors, shall be eligible for admission to the status and privileges of a foreign 
senior student.

AMERICAN-SCANDINAVIAN SOCIETY. 
On November 21, 1908, there’ was formed in New York City the 
American-Scandinavian Society. Its object is to encourage and 
organize cultural intercourse between the United States and Scandi- 
navia, especially by facilitating and promoting the following two 
forms of intercourse : 
1. Mutual visits of lecturers on scientific, professional, social, and other 
questions. The lecturers may be professors, teachers, or others. 
2. Mutual visits of students, the word “student” being used in its widest 
sense. These students may themselves be teachers, who may study educational 
features, and take certain courses at the universities or technical institutes; for 
Scandinavians visiting this country a study of the English lauguage will always 
be one of the objects of their visit. The students may also be undergraduates 
or graduates from colleges or technical schools, completing their education by 
a course at the foreign institution of learning. Finally, the students may be 
young men wishing to study industry, art, commerce, agriculture, or some 
profession. 
UNITED STATES UNIVERSITIES CLUB, ARGENTINE REPUBLIC. 
'The Bureau of Education has received information, through the 
Secretary of State, that a social club with the title “The United 
States Universities Club ” was organized in Buenos Aires on August 
4, 1909, at the American legation. There were enrolled 180 members, 
of whom 66 were present, representing 39 colleges and universities 
in the United States, but the membership includes Argentines as well 
as North Americans. Hon. Charles H. Sherril (Yale 89), the 
American minister to Argentina, was elected president of the club 
and Mr. Charles Lyon Chandler (Harvard ’05), secretary. 
In his address upon this occasion Mr. Sherril spoke of the great 
esteem felt among American university graduates for the name of 
the Argentine President, Sarmiento, because of his great service 
to education in Argentine Republic, but especially because of his 
admiration of the United States and the North American system of 
education, which led him to bring American teachers to his own 
country to establish a similar system there. The club was really 
founded, Mr. Sherril stated, in memory of President Sarmiento. 
In his letter to the Secretary of State, Minister Sherril expresses the 
hope that the club will be a factor in increasing the sympathetic 
understanding between Argentine Republic and the United States, 
and comments upon the cordial manner in which the Argentine young 
men received the plan and purposes of the club and their activity as 
members. 
The North American universities and colleges mentioned as being 
represented were the following: Harvard, Yale, Cornell, Columbia, 
Pennsylvania, Dértmouth, Williams, Brown, United States Naval

CHINESE STUDENTS IN THE UNITED STATES. 
By a joint resolution approved May 25, 1908, Congress provided 
for the remission of a portion of the Chinese indemnity for losses and 
expenses incurred during the so-called “ Boxer disturbances” in 
China in 1900. The arrangements approved by the President pro- 
vide for the remission of the following amounts in each of the years 
  indicated : :

  790, 196. 00 
  
In his message to Congress recommending the: remission of a 
portion of the indemnity the President said: 
This nation should help in every practicable way in the education of the 
Chinese people, so that the vast and populous Empire of China may gradually 
adapt itself to modern conditions. One way of doing this is by promoting the 
coming of Chinese students to this country and making it attractive to them to 
take courses at our universities and higher educational institutions. Our edu- 
cators should, so far as possible, take concerted action toward this end. 
The action of Congress was communicated to Prince Ch’ing, presi- 
dent of the board of foreign affairs of China, by the American 
minister, Mr. Rockhill, under date of July 11, 1908. In his letter of 
acknowledgment, dated July 14, 1908, the president of the board of 
foreign affairs of China says: 
The Imperial Government, wishing to give expression to the high value it 
places on the friendship of the United States, finds in its present action a
-P-A-G-E-219
    INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION RELATIONS. 207 
favorable opportunity for doing so. Mindful of the desire recently expressed 
by the President of the United States to promote the coming of Chinese students 
to the United States to take courses in the schools and higher educational institu- 
tions of the country, and convinced by the happy results of past experience of 
the great value to China of education in American schools, the Imperial Govern- 
ment has the honor to state that it is its intention to send henceforth yearly to 
the United States a considerable number of students there to receive their 
education. 
Under the same date the board of foreign affairs notified the 
American minster that— 
It has now been determined that from the year when the return of the 
indemnity begins 100 students shall be sent to America every year for four 
years, so that 400 students may be in America by the fourth year. From the 
fifth year and throughout the period of the indemnity payments a minimum of 
50 students will be sent-each year. 
As the number of students will be very great, there will be difficulty in 
making suitable arrangements for them. Therefore, in the matter of choosing 
them, as well as in the matter of providing suitable homes for them in America 
and selecting the schools which they are to enter, we hope to have your advice 
and assistance. The details of our scheme will have to be elaborated later, 
but we take this occasion to state the general features of our plan, and ask you 
to inform the American Government ‘of it. We sincerely hope that the American 
Government will render us assistance in the matter. 
Under date of December 29, 1908, the President of the United 
States issued instructions directing the Commissioner of Education 
of the United States— 
to aid in all appropriate ways within his power in the carrying out of the 
plans of the Chinese Government for the education of students in America. 
The following proposed regulations for the students to be sent to 
America were formulated by the Chinese Government: 
I. General statement. 
The students to be sent to America are to be supported out of the indemnity 
fund remitted by the United States. It is proposed to memorialize the Throne 
fixing the number of students to be sent abroad, with a statement of the general 
arrangements made for them, and at the same time to notify the American 
minister. 
The board of foreign affairs will be responsible for the establishment of the 
training schools and the appointment of the superintendent of students. 
The board of education will be responsible for the examination of the students 
after their graduation, as the board of foreign affairs may invite the board of 
education. 
The officials appointed by the board of foreign affairs and the American 
legation shall be jointly responsible for the selection of the students who are 
to be sent to America, and for their distribution in American educational 
institutions. 
II. The general purpose. 
The aim in sending students abroad at this.time is to obtain results in solid 
learning. Eighty per cent of those sent will specialize in industrial arts, agri-  
-P-A-G-E-220
  208 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
culture, mechanical engineering, mining, physics and chemistry, railway engi- 
neering, architecture, banking, railway administration, and similar branches, 
and 20 per cent will specialize in law and the science of government. 
Ill. Qualification of students. 
The requirements will be— 
(a) General intelligence. 
(6) Good character. 
(c) Good health. 
(d) Respectable social position. 
(e) Suitable age. 
(f) Knowledge of Chinese sufficient to write an essay of several hundred 
characters. 
(g) General knowledge of Chinese classical literature and history. 
(h) Knowledge of English sufficient to enable the student to enter an Ameri- 
can university or technical school. 
(i) The completion of a preparatory course in general studies. 
IV. The method of nomination of candidates. 
The board of education will choose the most promising students from all the 
schools and present them for examination. The board of foreign affairs will 
also call for applications. Students of both these classes must be fully up to 
the required standard or they will not be accepted as candidates. (Detailed 
regulations will be drawn up later.) 
V. The examination and choice of students. 
Officials appointed by the board of foreign affairs and one official appointed 
by the American legation will consult together and report to the board the 
detailed method of procedure. There shall be three tests: 
(a) Candidates must be inspected as to their physical condition by western 
trained physicians. 
(b) They must pass in Chinese. 
(c) They must pass in English and general branches. 
(Detailed regulations will be issued later.) 
Vi. The training school. 
The board of foreign affairs will establish a training school for students going 
to America (or branch schools will be established at Tientsin, Hankow, and 
Canton for the convenience of students from the different provinces). All the 
accepted candidates will enter this school or schools. Those sent out the first 
year will be trained for six months and those sent hereafter will be trained for 
one year. During this time the character and ability of the students will be 
closely inspected and only those found satisfactory will be sent abroad. Those 
found unsuitable will be rejected. (Detailed regulations will be issued later.) 
VII. The superintendence of the students abroad. 
At Washington, Chicago, or some other suitable place centrally located the 
office of the general superintendent will be established. Some one who has grad- 
uated from an American university and who has a reputation for ability will be 
appointed superintendent of students, and four or five assistants will be ap- 
pointed to attend to the placing of the students, to their finances, and to inspect 
their studies. These will make regular reports. (Detailed regulations will be 
issued later.)
-P-A-G-E-221
INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION RELATIONS. 209 
VIII. 
After the students have completed their courses of study and obtained their 
diplomas they will be presented by the board of foreign affairs to the board of 
education to be examined according to the regulations, and they will receive 
rank as may be determined by the board of education. 
NUMBER OF CHINESE STUDENTS IN THE UNITED STATES. 
The following statement respecting the education of Chinese stu- 
dents in the United States is taken from an article in the Outlook 
for November 28, 1908, by Mr. George Marvin, who has been for 
some time in official connection with the Chinese Government: 
The disposition on the part of the Chinese Government to send picked students 
to America for their education, although interrupted for many years after the 
first set of 20 came in 1872, has since 1890 shown a comparatively steady growth. 
During the past year 155 Chinese students were maintained at various educa- 
tional institutions in this country on foundations provided either by the imperial 
or the provincial governments. Out of this number, 71 are under the charge 
of the imperial Chinese legation at Washington; 27 are under the direction of 
Chang-Chuan, commissioner of education for the viceroyalties of Hupuh and 
Kiangnam; 57 others have been during the past year under the direction of 
Doctor Tenny, at present Chinese secretary of our legation at Peking. These 
last, although coming from various parts of the Empire, all received their 
elementary education at the Peyang College, in Tientsin, of which Doctor Tenny 
was formerly principal. At the request of Yuan-Shih-Kai, then viceroy of 
Chibli, of which province Tientsin is the chief city, Doctor Tenny in 1906 
assumed charge at Cambridge of the Peiyang candidates sent to America, includ- 
ing those now in Harvard and the various other colleges where, at his sugges- 
tion, they were quartered. Since Doctor Tenny’s return in July last to Peking, 
his position has been filled by the appointment of Mr. H. F. Merrill, for many 
years commissioner of customs at Tientsin, 
Quite apart from this official recognition of the advantages of an American 
education, many Chinese families send their sons, at their own expense, to 
schools and colleges in this country. It has been impossible to procure exact 
statistics of the number of these privately supported students, but, according 
to the best advices obtainable at the Chinese legation, there are about 200. 
PERSONNEL OF EXCHANGE PROFESSORS. 
On September 3, 4, and 5, 1908, Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler, presi- 
dent of Columbia University, New York City, lectured before the 
faculty and guests of the University of Copenhagen, Denmark. The 
subjects of the lectures were “The American as a political type,” 
“The American apart from his Government,” and “'The American 
and the intellectual life.” These lectures were the second of a series 
in the programme for an exchange of professors between American 
and Danish educational institutions. The American minister to Den- 
mark reports that— 
the effect was good. The leading journals gave full accounts of the lectures, 
and from many sources I have heard favorable comments on the satisfactory 
9228—rp 1909—von 1——14 
 
-P-A-G-E-222
    210 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
results to be accomplished by this scheme of university professional inter- 
changes. 
The trustees of Columbia University have appointed Prof. Otto 
Jespersen, Ph. D., of the University of Copenhagen, professor of 
English philology in Columbia for the academic year 1909-10. He 
will offer two lecture courses—one on phonetics, open to all language 
students, and one on historical English grammar. He will also give 
a seminar course on special problems of English syntax. (Columbia 
University Quarterly, March, 1909, p. 217.) 
The Kaiser Wilhelm professor at Columbia University for 1909-10 
is Dr. Karl Runge, of Gottingen. Doctor Runge’s first original work 
was in pure mathematics. His most recent specialty, and one upon 
which he will give a course at Columbia, is the study of graphical 
methods in physical and technological research. 
Prof. Eugen Kiihnemann, of Breslau, served at Harvard Univer- 
sity during the year 1908-9 as visiting German professor of German 
literature, and Prof. Joseph Redlich, of Vienna, was appointed lec- 
turer on government for the second half of the academic year. Dr. 
W. M. Davis, professor of geology at Harvard, served at the Uni- 
versity of Berlin during the year. Doctor Davis lectured during the 
first semester. 
Prof. George Foot Moore, Frothingham professor of the history 
of religion, has been selected as Harvard exchange professor at the 
University of Berlin for the academic year 1909-10. 
From the German universities Harvard has selected Edward Myer, 
professor of ancient history in the University of Berlin, to teach at 
Harvard during the first half year. 
Prof. Bliss Perry, of the department of English of Harvard Uni- 
versity, has been appointed Harvard lecturer at the University of 
Paris and other French universities for 1909-10. 
INTERNATIONAL BUREAU OF NATIONAL TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATIONS. 
The Berliner Tageblatt reports that there has been in existence, 
since 1905, an international union of national teachers’ associations in 
Europe. It held its last meeting in London. To this union belong 
the German National Teachers’ Association, with 116,000 paying 
members; the English Teachers’ Union, with 61,000; the Bohemian 
society, with 8,000; the Bulgarian society, with 4,000; the Union 
of Netherlandish Teachers, with 8,000; the Holland Teachers’ Guild, 
with about 8,000; the French Lay Teachers’ Association, with 60,000; 
the Belgian, with 6,500; and the Association of Luxemburg, with 
1,500, making a total of 273,000 paying members. The following 
associations have indicated their desire to join the union: The 
Italian, Norwegian, Danish, Spanish, Polish, Swiss, Hungarian, and
-P-A-G-E-223
  INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION RELATIONS. 211 
Croation teachers’ associations. In the last annual report of the 
bureau, or central office of the union, the activities of each association 
during the preceding year are given. A brief synopsis of the report 
may show that, despite all national animosities, there are a number of 
important points of contact in the professional aspirations of the 
teachers of Europe to aid in securing a better mutual international 
understanding. 
The English union chiefly occupied itself with the proposed re- 
vision of the school law then before Parliament. Another object in 
view of the English teachers was the diminution in the size of the 
classes, which in many places still have between 60 and 80 pupils; 
adequate pay for teachers—the universal demand in every civilized 
nation—engaged the English teachers also. 
The Belgian Teachers’ Association is waging a war with the cler- 
icals in favor of a system of secular common schools open to all chil- 
dren of whatever religious denomination. Special attention was 
given in this Kingdom to a revision of the law dealing with teachers’ 
pensions. 
The Bulgarian Teachers’ Society passed through a crisis. A 
former government considered teachers dangerous to the State, and 
submitted to Parliament two bills, subsequently passed, which pro- 
hibited teachers from being or becoming members of the teachers’ 
society, and likewise from participating in political affairs (elec- 
tions). The teachers would not submit to a loss of the rights and 
prerogatives of citizenship, and accordingly held meetings in which 
the two laws were denounced and resolutions passed which called for 
disobedience to these laws so hostile to the profession. The Govern- 
ment replied by discharging from office 500 delegates to the meetings 
of the society, but it did not dissolve the latter. Happily, a more 
liberal government coming into power at the beginning of 1908, all 
the discharged teachers were promptly reinstated, and the laws con- 
cerning the political rights of teachers were revised and purged of 
their objectionable features. 
In Italy, the teachers secured an increase of the minimum salary 
from 560 to 750 lire ($108 to $145), and an increase of the maximum 
salary from 1,350 to 1,500 lire ($260 to $290), with annual increases 
of 100 lire for a number of years. Success in Italy, as well as in 
other countries, was possible only through united action on the part 
of the teachers, who begin to recognize their own power as intel- 
lectual leaders in cities, towns, and villages. 
In France, also, an improvement in wages was secured through the 
efforts of the National Association of Lay Teachers. This associa- 
tion demanded for every school district the appointment of a pro- 
fessional commission, which is to take part in the administration of 
schools, and deal with questions of discipline, course/of study, text- 
 
-P-A-G-E-224
    212 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
books, and other exclusively pedagogical affairs. The Government 
has acknowledged these demands in principle, and has decreed the 
appointment of such commissions, though with prerogatives much 
more limited than originally demanded. 
In Denmark the National Teachers’ Union aims at an improve- 
ment in the teachers’ professional preparation, and at better school 
supervision. Their wishes concerning more liberal wages have been 
met to a gratifying degree, since the Government has granted a 
uniform increase of 25 per cent. 
The Berliner Tageblatt closes its account of the London inter- 
national meeting with the following words: 
Everywhere the same picture: The teachers in battle array! The teachers 
fighting for bread, for political liberty and social advancement, for the liberty 
of the school against the attacks of state and church, and for a just appre- 
ciation and valuation of their labor and their honor. 
FOREIGN STUDENTS IN GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 
During the summer semester of 1908 there were 3,594 foreign stu- 
dents enrolled in the 21 German universities, according to a statement 
in the K6lnische Zeitung, against 3,869 in the winter of 1907-8, 3,766 
in the summer of 1907, 3,889 two years ago, 2,819 four years ago, 
and 1,200 in 1881. In comparison with the winter semester of 1906-7, 
during which the number of foreign students reached the maximum, 
to wit, 4,151, the last enumeration shows a decrease of 557, which 
is partly attributable to the withdrawal of 227 Russians in conse- 
quence of more rigorous conditions of admission. 
The decrease in the number of foreign students can best be shown 
relatively. They formed 7.5 per cent of the entire number of en- 
rolled students in the winter of 1908-9, 8.3 per cent in the summer of 
1907, 9.2 per cent in the winter of 1907-8, and 8.6 per cent in the 
summer of 1906. Asiatic students, mostly Japanese, increased from 
144 to 181; also the students from southern and southeastern Europe 
increased in number, except from Greece. Bulgaria sent 150 (142 
in the previous year) ; Roumania, 92 (88) ; Servia, 66 (63) ; Turkey, 
43 (39) ; Italy, 41 (36) ; Switzerland, 293 (282); Belgium, 24 (18) ; 
Netherlands, 58 (54) ; France, 55 (52); Austria-Hungary, 660 (654). 
Decreases are recorded among the Russians, 1,373 (1,600 in the pre- 
vious year) ; Englishmen, 148 (151); Norwegians, 32 (86); Amer- 
icans, 252 (261). Europe as a whole sent 3,148, against 3,349 in the 
previous year. 
Most of the foreigners studied medicine, 948 (958 in the previous 
year) ; 881 (915) studied philology and history; 604 (651) mathe- 
matics and natural sciences; 488 (511) administration and political 
economy ; 426 (479) law; 190 (197) theology; 29 dentistry; 16 phar- 
macy; 12 forestry.

PROPOSED ANGLO-AMERICAN EXCHANGE OF STUDENTS. 
An influential committee has been formed in Great Britain to pro- 
mote international exchange of students between the universities of 
Great Britain, Canada, and the United States. Premier Asquith and 
Lord Strathcona head the committee, and included in it are Lord 
Curzon, chancellor of the University of Oxford; Mr. Balfour, chan- 
cellor of the University of Edinburgh; the lord chancellor, and other 
distinguished men, including a large representation of professors 
from the British universities. Committees have not been yet organ- 
ized in the United States and Canada, but leading educators -have 
promised their cooperation. The plan aims at providing oppor- 
tunities to students of the three countries to obtain some real insight 
into the life, progress, and customs of other nations, with a minimum 
of inconvenience to their academic work at the least possible expense. 
It is also proposed to establish two students’ traveling bureaus, one 
in New York and one in London; an American secretary (resident 
in New York) and a British secretary (resident in London), both 
_ of whom shall be college men, appointed to afford every facility to 
any graduate or undergraduate of any university who wishes to visit 
the United States, Canada, or the United Kingdom for the purpose 
of obtaining an insight into the student, national, and industrial life 
of those countries. 
PROVISION FOR FOREIGN STUDENTS. 
Columbia University, New York City, has received from Mr. Niels 
Poulson, of Brooklyn, N. Y., the sum of $650 for the establishment 
of an annual fellowship for a student from one of the Scandinavian 
universities. 
Beginning with September 1, 1908, Harvard University has under- 
taken for a period of ten years to accept as guests of the corporation 
each year five German students of advanced standing to be selected by
-P-A-G-E-226

the Prussian ministry of education; the students to have access to all 
departments of the university free of tuition. (Harvard Graduates’ 
Magazine, December, 1908, p. 280.) 
. The following gifts for the support of Chinese students at Harvard 
are reported: Henry L. Higginson, $2,000; Miss Ellen F. Mason, 
$1,500; Mrs. T. J. Bowlker, $1,500. 
There has been established in Géttingen, Germany, the Béttinger- 
Studienhaus, which is intended to serve not only as a bureau of in- 
formation where foreign students may obtain all necessary facts with 
regard to the German universities and technical schools, but also to 
assist such students to secure suitable accommodations in German 
families. It is intended to maintain in the Studienhaus courses of 
instruction in German. (Columbia University Quarterly, December, 
1908, p. 81.) 
A scholarship of $1,500, to be held at Oxford, Cambridge, or Lon- 
don University, for the year beginning October, 1910, will be 
awarded to an American woman by the General Federation of 
Women’s Clubs of America. The candidate for the scholarship must 
be under 27 years of age, unmarried, and a graduate of an American 
college of good standing. She must undergo the same qualifying 
examinations as are provided for men competing for Cecil Rhodes 
scholarships. 
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF COSMOPOLITAN CLUBS. 
The first international or cosmopolitan students’ club was started 
at the University of Wisconsin in 1903. Since then similar clubs have 
been formed at 16 other universities. Each of the clubs is composed 
of practically all of the foreign students at the university, with some 
Americans. These clubs have been organized into a body called the 
“ National Association of Cosmopolitan Clubs,” which held its second 
annual convention at Ann Arbor December 31, 1908-January 2, 1909. 
From an article in the Independent of January 28, 1909, by Louis 
Lochner, the first president of the association, it appears that the total 
membership of the clubs is about 1,500, and that 50 countries are rep- 
resented. The following extracts from Mr. Lochner’s article show the 
objects and activities of the clubs: 
The purpose of these clubs is to bring together college young men from differ- 
ent countries; to aid and direct foreign students coming to America to learn the 
customs, view points, and characteristics of other nationalities; and to establish 
international friendships. 
One of the most significant events [at the convention] was the taking of initial 
steps toward an affiliation of the association with the International Federation 
of Students of Europe, better known as “Corda Fratres.” This organization, 
which has a membership of 63 chapters or consulates, representing 15,000 stu- 
dents, aims to do for students at European universities what the Association of 
Cosmopolitan Clubs endeavors to accomplish in America. * * * The work
-P-A-G-E-227
    
INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION RELATIONS. 215 
will thus be on an international basis, and undoubtedly much more effective. 
Students coming from Europe will be received and aided by members of the 
association, and members going to Europe will be similarly aided and guided 
through the consulates of Corda Fratres. * * * 
By its enrollment as an auxiliary of the American Peace Society and its rec- 
ommendation to individual members to become correspondents of the Lake 
Mohonk conference on international arbitration the Association of Cosmo- 
politan Clubs took another great step in advance during the Ann Arbor conven- 
Home. +) *) * 
The activities of the cosmopolitan clubs are numerous and varied. Lectures 
on international topics, informal discussions on subjects of foreign interest, 
receptions to the newly arrived foreigners at the beginning of the college year, 
musicales at which national songs are the piéces de resistance, and occasional 
social functions are some of the forms which these activities take. * * * 
As an agency for promoting the final establishment of permanent peace among 
the nations, there is nothing in the educational sphere likely to bear richer 
fruit. The foreign students for the most part come from the very best fam- 
ilies. Many are sent by their governments. They will in many cases become 
leaders of public opinion and even of the political spirit and policies of their 
nation. In proportion as they can be brought in closer contact with their fel- 
low-student of different race or nationality, and learn that war and hostility 
are thoughts remote from the rising generation, will the hopes for the realiza- 
tion of world peace be increased. 
The third convention of the association will be held at Cornell 
during the Christmas holidays of 1909. : 
The officers of the association are: Louis P. Lochner, University of 
Wisconsin, president; Bjarue H. Graff, University of Wisconsin, sec- 
retary-treasurer; Frank D. Mitchell, Cornell University, recording 
secretary. The Cosmopolitan Annual is the official organ of the 
association. 
“CORDA FRATRES ”—INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF STUDENTS. 
[Founded at Turin (Italy), Nov. 15, 1898 ; proclaimed at Rome, the Roman Forum, Nov. 24, 
1898 ; reorganized at Liége (Belgium), Sept. 4, 1905.] 
Official list of the organization..—President founder, Dr. Efisio

Fundamental articles of the federation——(Approved at the First 
International Congress of the federation at Turin, Nov. 12-20, 1898.) 
I. The name of the federation is “ International Federation of 
Students,” translated into the national language, and preceded by 
“Corda Fratres ” as the motto of the federation itself.   
«Only the officers given in this translation, There are 63 local consulates distributed 
among most of the principal university centers of Europe.  
-P-A-G-E-228
  216 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
II. The principal object of the International Federation of Stu- 
dents is to protect and promote the idea of solidarity and of fraternity 
among the students. 
III. Any student has the right to become a member of the federa- 
tion provided he be registered in a university or institution of higher 
learning, regardless of his religious or political ideas. 
IV. Each member, upon his entrance into the federation, pledges 
himself upon his honor to employ unceasingly such means as his social 
position, his intelligence, and his activity afford to promote the spirit 
of international union among the youth, and to second all the mani- 
festations which he may believe useful in order to dissipate from any 
class of persons whatsoever the prejudices and hatred which render 
states reciprocally hostile and always on a war footing. 
V. The International Federation of Students proposes also to 
second by all the means in its power the work of peace and arbitra- 
tion between nations. 
VI. It is also the object of the federation to put in correspondence 
the students themselves, and in particular those who devote them- 
selves to the same branch of learning, in order to facilitate the means 
of information and scientific research, of which they may eventually 
have need, both before and after the doctorate. 
VII. To insure reciprocally hosts and friends in the large cities, 
distantly located, upon the occasion of travels, individual and col- 
lective, in foreign lands—travels which will thus be more easily under- 
taken and accomplished. 
VIII. The fundamental principles, unanimously accepted as here- 
tofore mentioned, shall regulate the federation and can not be 
changed.

CHINESE AND KOREAN STUDENTS IN JAPAN. 
[Compiled from the report for the year ending September 30, 1908, of J. M. Clinton, general 
secretary of the Chinese Young Men’s Christian Association, Tokyo.] 
There are to-day 5,000 students in Tokyo representing every Prov- 
ince of China. One year ago there were almost double this number. 
But while the number has decreased, the quality and standard of the 
students has greatly increased. The number for the past six months 
has remained almost stationary. There are many reasons for this 
decrease in numbers. Many who came to Tokyo at first were not real 
students but came because it was popular to come to Japan. Others
-P-A-G-E-231
  INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION RELATIONS. 219 
came for “short-term courses.” Still others came for political pur- 
poses. Now very strict examinations are held both in China and 
Japan. Every student coming to Japan must first pass these exami- 
nations. These restrictions have shut out the incompetent students. 
All “short-term” schools have therefore disappeared. The Japa- 
nese government schools and the large private schools, like Waseda 
University, will now not admit Chinese students unless they enroll 
for a term of four or more years. This at once shows the stability 
of the Chinese students now in Japan. The revolutionary class, so 
strong at one time, are now not so much in evidence. The Chinese 
students now here mean business. They have come to complete their 
courses and they are doing so. During the past year many, honors 
in the various schools have been won by the Chinese students. It is 
significant that most of these honors have been won by members and 
students of the Chinese Young Men’s Christian Association. 
How long this army of 5,000 Chinese students will remain in Tokyo 
is difficult to say. There are many facts which indicate that they 
may remain here for a number of years yet. In conversation with 
the Chinese minister a few days ago he said the Chinese Government 
was still supporting 2,500 students here and that there were no indi- 
cations or reasons for decreasing this number in the near future. 
The Chinese Imperial Government itself has decided to send at least 
200 new students to Japan each year for the next five years. 
In every sphere above the mere material the Chinese scholar is 
king in his own community. Many of these students in Tokyo are 
sons of landed gentry, a class very powerful for good or evil in their 
native places. Others are sons of officials and merchants and mem- 
bers of the literati. About one-half of the 5,000 Chinese students 
of Tokyo, as shown above, are supported by the provincial govern- 
ments, and are selected by competitive examinations. Some are sent 
by city or village guilds. Others are supported by groups of friends, 
relatives, or parents. The position of each is gained either by family 
influence or by the competitive test. Every one, therefore, is a picked 
man, selected on account of ability or social influence. 
Already the new leaven is working. A Chinese writing in a recent 
issue of the Westminster Review says of these men after returning 
from their studies abroad: 
Fairly educated, and having had proper training, the students return from 
Japan to establish private schools everywhere at their own expense. The work 
is disinterestedly carried on. Many teachers sacrifice their own fortunes in 
the enterprise. But they are gaining ground by degrees, especially in normal 
schools and kindergartens. The antiopium and antifootbinding movements 
, Would not have been so general but for the energetic preaching both by tongue 
and pen of the students returned from Japan. The doctrine in favor of the 
emancipation of women is spreading daily, and before long the education of the 
other sex will receive equal attention. 
 
-P-A-G-E-232
    
220 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
The writer of the article goes on to show how the literature of 
China is becoming reshaped by the new learning. Thousands of new 
words are being incorporated into the body of the national vocabu- 
lary. “ New expressions, new constructions of sentences ” are making 
a revolution in the Chinese literary world. A new activity has laid 
hold of the pens of ready and able writers, and ideas alive, pulsating 
with vitality, are being given forth without cessation. The student 
body is the mainspring of the movement in China; in fact, is the 
movement. 
The Chinese students are great readers. They are not only seeking 
all the knowledge they can get through the medium of their own lan- 
guage, but are reading books in other languages, especially Japanese, 
English, French, and German. The association reading rooms are 
supplied with many of the leading newspapers and magazines, pub- 
lished in Chinese, Japanese, and English. 
The stream of Korean young life continues to flow toward the land 
of the rising sun. And this is true regardless of the fact that there 
is a strong racial feeling between the two peoples. The Korean stu- 
dents are not coming to Japan because of any love for Japan, but for 
self-protection and self-preservation. They are willing to come for 
the sake of the learning they can get. Many have come to learn the 
secret of Japan’s success. Korea is now giving herself up to the 
acquirements of western civilization. She is now not only trying to’ 
learn what Japan can teach her in Korea, but she is sending in great 
numbers her young men to Japan. There are to-day 700 Korean 
students in Tokyo alone, enrolled in the various government and pri- 
vate schools. This is an increase of 200 over last year. Men of all 
ages are coming to Japan to study. Many of them are from 30 to 40 
years of age. There are also no less than 100 who are under 18 years 
of age. The average age of the total number now is about 19, as 
against 22 of last year. On the whole, a younger class of men and 
boys are coming. 
The educational work of the Korean association has grown in popu- 
larity until now more than 100 students are enrolled in its classes. 
English, Japanese, history, mathematics, and a few other subjects 
are being taught in the association classes. 
BRITISH AND GERMAN UNIVERSITIES IN CHINA. 
A British university is to be established in Hongkong, which will 
limit itself, in the first place, to instruction in medicine and engineer- 
ing, because these are the two branches of Western science for which 
at present there is the largest demand in China. A citizen has offered 
$135,000, to be used in constructing suitable buildings, on condition 
that adequate funds, computed at $500,000, are provided for purposes 
 
-P-A-G-E-233
  
INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION RELATIONS. 221 
of equipment and endowment. An essential feature of the scheme is 
that all students shall reside in colleges and hostels where they will 
be constantly in touch with the British professional staff, and thus 
withdrawn from the unwholesome influences which too often sur- 
round Chinese students in a Chinese city. 
The German educational establishment which is to be created at 
Kiao-chau is in name only a high school, but in reality its scope is 
much larger than that of the projected British university at Hong- 
kong. Besides medical and technical branches, it will comprise an 
agricultural branch (including forestry), and a political science 
branch, comprehending international law, state and administrative 
law, mining and maritime law, political economy, and finance. The 
technical branch, to which special importance is evidently attached, 
will cover not only mining, electrical and railway engineering, but 
also architecture and shipbuilding. 
Nor is this all. In connection with the high school there is to be a 
preparatory school of six classes on the lines of a German realschule 
(without Latin), for which pupils will be received from Chinese gov- 
ernment schools, as well as from other German schools already exist- 
ing in China. The German Government assumes the whole cost, ex- 
cept for a contribution of $10,000 from the Peking government, which 
has agreed, moreover, to accept the certificate issued by the Kiao-chau 
High School as a qualification for admission to the Chinese govern- 
ment service. The capital cost of the Kiao-chau establishment is 
estimated at $160,000, and the annual outlay at $50,000. 
A Tokyo correspondent of the London Times, from whom we obtain 
these facts, points out that another important feature of the Kiao- 
chau plan is the creation of a translating department, in which Ger- 
man linguists, assisted by Chinese scholars, will undertake the trans- 
lation of German text-books and other works into the vernacular, 
presumably the Mandarin or literary dialect. The activity of this 
department is not to be confined to school instruction alone, but to be 
extended to the whole field of literature. (Extracts from the Boston 
Transcript, Aug. 30, 1909.) 
CHRISTIAN EDUCATION IN CHINA. 
At the Sixteenth Annual Conference of the Foreign Mission Boards 
of the United States and Canada, held in New York in January, 1909, 
a committee on education in China was appointed. The resolution 
creating the committee, as passed by the conference, was as follows: 
Resolved further, That the proposal for the appointment of a committee on 
the present educational needs and opportunities in China be approved, and that 
this committee consist of the committee on reference and counsel with the addi- 
tion of twelve laymen, not more than half of whom shall be members of mission

boards, these laymen to be chosen by the committee on reference and counsel, 
and this new committee to appoint its own officers. 
Resolved further, That the function of this committee shall be to promote a 
larger interest in Christian education in China, but it shall not itself receive or 
administer funds therefor without further action of this conference.    
        
    
                      
    
   
    
   
    
     
    This will be the active committee, for at least a year, in this coun- 
try, for the union Christian educational effort for China. 
Mr. W. Henry Grant, 156 Fifth avenue, New York, is secretary. 
XVII. HEALTH AND HYGIENE. 
DEPARTMENT OF SCHOOL HYGIENE, ST. LOUIS PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
(The Rolow ing information is taken from a paper on the above subject furnished this 
office by Supt. Ben Blewett, of the St. Louis schools.] 
The St. Louis board of education in February, 1909, gave its ap- 
proval to a report by the superintendent of instruction, in which was 
presented a plan for establishing a department the function of which 
should be to discover and cause to be remedied, as far as possible, 
physical defects and communicable diseases that might interfere with 
efficient school work. In giving effect to this plan the following 
sections were added to rule 8: 
Src. XVI. There shall be a division of the department of instruction, desig- 
nated as the “department of school hygiene.” 
Src. XVII. The work of this department shall be— 
(a) To examine all of the pupils at least once’a year for the purpose of 
ascertaining the existence of any physical defect that interferes with the pupil’s 
progress in the school, and to report any such defect to the parents, and advise 
that the family physician be consulted. 
(0) To examine daily all evidences of the presence in the schools of com- 
municable disease and to make prompt report of all cases of such to the board 
of health or its officers. 
(c) To examine the sanitary conditions of the school premises and to make 
report of it to the superintendent of instruction. 
Src. XVIII. The superintendent of instruction shall have power to appoint 
for this work a supervisor of hygiene and as*many inspectors of hygiene as the 
board may from time to time determine. 
The supervisor and inspectors shall be graduates of medical colleges of 
recognized standing. 
Sec. XIX. The supervisor of hygiene shall be a skilled physician and shall 
have general supervision of the work of the department and such other duties 
connected with it as may be assigned to him by the superintendent of instruction. 
He shall devote his entire time to the work of the department. 
Src, XX. The inspectors of hygiene shall devote themselves to this work for 
ten months in each year, and shall during all school hours be engaged in their 
investigations in the school buildings; and during the school term shall use  
-P-A-G-E-235
  HEALTH AND HYGIENE. 223 
such further time as shall be required for making the necessary examinations 
and reports. 
No one shall be nominated for or appointed to the position of inspector of 
hygiene who has not passed successfully an examination offered by the board 
of education to all candidates for such positions. This examination shall be 
given both as a test of professional training and experience.as a physician, and 
of personal qualifications for this special work. 
Sec. XXI. The supervisor and inspectors shall be elected for a term of one 
year by the board of education upon nomination of the superintendent of 
instruction. The schedule of salaries shall be so fixed as to include the neces- 
sary expenses for car fare or livery, for which no extra allowance shall be made. 
Src, XXII. The supervisor and inspectors shall not treat any case of physical 
defect or disease that has been discovered by either of them while engaged in 
the work of this department. 
Src, XXIII. The provisions of the rules of the board of education and of the 
charter, relating to the suspension and removal of teachers, shall apply to the 
supervisor and inspectors in this department. 
Sec. XXIV. The work of the department shall be conducted under such fur- 
ther regulations as may be prescribed by the superintendent of instruction, with 
the approval of the board of education. 
Five districts were to be provisionally established, and each as- 
signed to one inspector of hygiene. The following scale of salaries 
was proposed: Supervisor, first year, $2,500; second year, $2,600; 
this salary to be paid in twelve monthly installments. Inspectors, 
first year, $1,200; second year, $1,300; third year, $1,400; fourth year, 
$1,500; these salaries to be paid in ten monthly installments. 
It was also recommended that a bacteriological laboratory be 
opened in the board of education building, or in some school building, 
and that it be equipped with necessary instruments and supplies. 
The opinion of the attorney was required on the suggested change 
of rules. The following portions of his opinion answer the question. 
of the right of the board to undertake the proposed work: 
Our state constitution declares that a “general diffusion of knowledge and 
intelligence is essential to the preservation of the rights and liberties of the 
people,” and therefore provides for the establishment and maintenance of free 
public schools. Pursuant to this constitutional provision, the general assembly 
in 1833 provided for the establishment of such schools in St. Louis, and in 
that act it was provided that the board of education “shall have power to 
make all rules, ordinances, and statutes proper for the government and man- 
agement of such schools and property, so that the same shall not be incon- 
sistent with the laws of the land,” and generally to do all lawful acts which 
may be proper or convenient to carry into effect the business of the corporation. 
It is a fundamental principle in statutory and constitutional construction that 
a comprehensive grant of power, particularly for the accomplishment of great 
public ends, necessarily carries with it the right to select any appropriate 
means which are not prohibited by law. 
It therefore follows that the board of education may determine, in the exer- 
cise of a wise discretion, whether the establishment of a department of school 
hygiene, with a supervisor and a number of inspectors in charge, is a necessary 
or proper means for maintaining the efficiency of the schools, whether such   
 
-P-A-G-E-236
    
224 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
means are reasonably required for “the general diffusion of knowledge and 
intelligence” which our constitution declares to be ‘‘essential to the preser- 
vation of the rights and liberties of the people.” 
The superintendent of instruction reported to the board in April, 
1909, as follows:. 
In accordance with the provisions of rule 8, Section XX, and the action of 
the board at the February meeting, an examination of candidates for the posi- 
tion of inspector of hygiene was held on April 28. 
The examination was conducted by the superintendent of instruction, assisted 
by the medical adviser and the assistant superintendents. 
The examination consisted of a written test of professional scholarship and 
experience and an oral test of special fitness for the work. 
The written test was covered by sets of questions on seven general topics. 
During the written examination the candidates’ papers were identified by 
the numbers and not by the names of the writers. In estimating the results 
of the examination, 50 per cent was allowed to the written test and 50 per cent 
to the oral test. The value of testimonials entered into the oral test. Fifty 
physicians having the qualifications required by the board presented them- 
selves for the examination. Of this number; 46 were white men, 2 white women, 
and 2 colored men. Complete reports on the examination, including sets of 
questions given in the written examination, are placed in the files in the super- 
intendent’s office. 
Eligible list.—Upon a careful review of the per cent returns of the examina- 
tion, without knowledge of the names of the candidates, it was thought best to 
report to the board the names of all who made 75 per cent or more, and in the 
order of their standing in the examination. 
The work of the new department will begin with the opening of 
the new school -year (1909-10). Each inspector will have under his 
care between three and four thousand pupils, including the pupils of 
one of the special schools for individual instruction. 
The details of administration of the department are being worked 
out. These details will include forms of reports and records for the 
guidance of the department and for the information of teachers, phy- 
sicians, and the general public. 
THE BROOKLINE DAY CAMP AND SCHOOL FOR TUBERCULAR 
CHILDREN. 
This camp and school combined, located in Brookline, Mass., a 
residence town adjoining the city of Boston, was opened July 7, 1908, 
and closed September 26 following. The officers of the Brookline 
Friendly Society, the Brookline Anti-Tuberculosis Society, and the 
health department united in an effort to arrest the development of 
tuberculosis found in its early stages in 23 boys and girls taken from 
the poorer districts of the town. The camp was located on the grounds 
of the board of health hospital, and was arranged, with reference to 
shelter and accommodations, very much as day camps for adult tuber- 
culosis patients are arranged in other parts of the country.

HEALTH AND HYGIENE. 225 
Visits were made to the camp daily, except on Sundays. A picnic 
barge collected the children early in the morning and carried them 
out for the day. A cook and an experienced nurse, who served both 
as nurse and teacher, were employed to accompany the patients. 
The primary object of the endeavor was to promote outdoor rest, 
recreation, and good feeling, but nature study was encouraged and 
books from the public library were supplied. 
_ Of the success of the work Supt. Arthur A. Wordell, of the Brook- 
line Friendly Society, writes: 
Seven of the children appear to have the progress of their disease entirely 
arrested, and with one exception all gained in weight and general condition, 
OPEN-AIR SCHOOL FOR TUBERCULAR CHILDREN AT PITTSBURG. 
The Tuberculosis League of Pittsburg, Pa., is maintaining an open- 
air school for the children in the hospital for tuberculosis who are 
well enough to go to school from one to five hours per day. There 
are 10 children in the school, which is conducted on one of the open 
verandas of the hospital. A new building has been promised by the 
Hebrew Benevolent Society which will accommodate 30 children. 
The teacher for the school is paid by the Civic Club and by private 
endeavors. 
COURSE IN SANITARY SCIENCE AT COLUMBIA. 
President Butler, of Columbia University, has appointed a com- 
mittee of 12 members to consider the establishment of a school of 
sanitary science and public health. While plans for the school are 
in course of development the committee deemed it advisable to inau- 
gurate the niovement by an introductory course of lectures on the 
topics that would be included in the school. The course was inaugu- 
rated during the second term of the academic year 1908-9. (Colum- ° 
bia University Quarterly, March, 1909, p. 213.) 
COURSE IN GENERAL HYGIENE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN. 
The prevention of disease among students in the university is the 
prime aim of the new course of study on general hygiene which has 
just been announced for the second semester, beginning February 23. 
The relation of the mind to health, the care of the nervous system, 
infectious diseases and antitoxins, the effects of drugs, alcohol, and 
tobacco, food supplies and their adulteration, exercise and health, 
water and milk supply, and a series of similar subjects are to be dis- 
cussed for the benefit of the students in weekly lectures by members 
of the faculty from the college of medicine, department of bacte- 
riology, physical training department, and chemistry department.

226 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
Prof. William Thompson Sedgwick, of the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology, will give two lectures in this course on air supply and 
ventilation and on water supply and water purification. (University 
Bulletin, February, 1909.) 
UNDERFED CHILDREN IN CHICAGO, 
The problem of underfed school children, which has engaged edu- 
cational thought in large European cities for a quarter of a century 
or more, has recently forced itself upon the attention of school author- 
ities in some of our American centers of population, notably New 
York and Chicago. In the latter city a special committee was ap- 
pointed to investigate conditions among indigent school children and 
to report the results of their investigations to the school board. Pur- 
suant to such appointment, reports and opinions were submitted in 
October, 1908. The superintendent of compulsory education, at the 
time of making his statement, estimated the number of underfed chil- 
dren in the city at 15,000. 
In the opinion of the attorney of the board of education, money ap- 
propriated for school purposes can not be expended for food, how- 
ever necessitous the case. Accordingly it was decided to cooperate 
with charitable organizations by using the truant-officer force and 
other agencies of the school system to find out and report needy cases. 
Basement rooms in school buildings and other suitable places have 
been fitted up in some of the poorer districts, and charity workers 
have furnished free breakfasts and lunches to many hungry children. 
In this way a double purpose has been served—the needy child’s hun- 
ger has been appeased and increased efficiency in its school work has 
been secured. 
XVIII. PLAYGROUNDS. 
Chicago.—The Playground Association of Chicago will hold the 
third annual Chicago play festival on Chicago Day, Saturday, Octo- 
ber 9, 1909. There will be three sessions—10 a. m., 2 p. m., and 7 
p.m. At the morning session kindergarten and younger school chil- 
dren will take part; at the afternoon session older children and 
younger people will present games and playground activities. At 
the evening session, as principal events in a varied programme, young 
people and adults will contribute gymnastic, national, and folk dances 
and games. 
The participants will come from playgrounds, schools, social set- 
tlements, turner societies, and other organizations interested in play
-P-A-G-E-239

and recreation. Many of the national dances will be given by immi- 
grant groups in costume. 
The 1908 festival had about 2,000 participants and an attendance 
for the day of 30,000, including many visitors from other cities. The 
occasion, to which everyone is freely welcome, is rapidly becoming a 
great yearly civic event in the life of Chicago. 
Indiana.—An act of the legislature of Indiana, dated March 5, 1909, 
authorizes the board of school trustees or commissioners in cities of 
the first, second, third, and fourth class to establish, equip, and main- 
tain public playground or playgrounds, to be used by the public 
during the summer-vacation period. Use may be made of school 
grounds and buildings, and the boards are authorized to purchase 
or lease additional grounds for the purpose out of the school reve- 
nues. The compensation of directors of playgrounds and their as- 
sistants shall be paid out of the school revenues. In cities having a 
board of park commissioners the duties respecting playgrounds shall 
devolve upon a playground commission consisting of five members, 
two of whom shall be members of the board of school commissioners 
or selected by such board, two shall be members of the board of park 
commissioners or designated by such board, and one shall be ap- 
pointed by the mayor. The board of park commissioners is author- 
ized to contribute toward the expense of establishing, maintaining, 
and equipping playgrounds. 
For an account of the Third Annual Congress of the Playground 
Association of America see page 79.

    234 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
XX. EDUCATION OF THE COLORED RACE. 
  
NEGRO RURAL SCHOOL FUND—ANNA T. JEANES FOUNDATION. 
[Compiled from statements made to the board by James H. Dillard, president and 
general agent.] 
From StateMent IV, Apri 10, 1909. 
We have paid for salaries to date, $9,862; for building and equip- 
ment, $1,905; for extension of term, $407.50. The disparity in salar- 
ies is striking. As a rule the higher salaries are at the instigation of 
the county superintendents, and at times the amount per month has 
apparently been regulated by the lateness of beginning thé work. 
In two places the salary has been divided by special arrangement. 
In the contributions made for building and equipment, and for exten- 
sion of terms, I have asked to be assured that at least an equal amount 
had been raised. Certain offers for these purposes are still out- 
standing. 
In selecting the schools in which we were to pay the salary of an 
industrial teacher, I have had in mind mainly the consideration 
whether the point seemed one in which the work would be encouraged 
and supported, and where its influence would be likely to spread. 
It can hardly be expected that some mistake has not been made, but 
from all the information I can obtain, I believe that our teachers have 
the right spirit and are trying to do good work in school and 
neighborhood. I have studiously avoided the danger of having our 
teacher used to supplant the work of other teachers, and have found 
but one instance in which this was being done, namely, at Ruther- 
fordton, N. C. I found that the industrial teacher to whom, at the 
request of the county superintendent, we are paying $40 a month 
was devoting only six hours a week to industrial work, being used, 
contrary to our understanding, to save the expense of an assistant 
teacher. Our teachers offer an excellent clientele for the distribution 
of leafiets and pamphlets dealing with any feature of rural improve- 
ment. I have sent out a pamphlet on school gardens, and am pre- 
paring to mail others on this and other subjects. 
Two of our teachers in the eastern part of North Carolina have 
begun to do good work in the way of organization. Both of these are 
men, and one of them, a graduate of the North Carolina Agricultural 
and Mechanical College at Greensboro, will work for us in this direc- 
tion a month or perhaps two months after the close of the school. 
I hope gradually to find more men like this one. I think very 
highly of the Henrico plan and hope that its suggestion will be 
adopted and tried in other places, and I have some reason to believe 
 
-P-A-G-E-247
  
EDUCATION OF THE COLORED RACE. 235 
that it will be. Already five superintendents have expressed a desire 
to try the plan next session. In my opinion the money expended has 
nowhere counted for so much as here. Good results are shown not 
only in the extension of the industrial work, but in the additional 
important fact that such a teacher serves incidentally as a supervisor, 
and supervision is one of the greatest needs of the rural schools. If 
we could have a hundred counties in the South supplied with super- 
vising teachers of this kind the influence would be tremendous. 
In February, March, and April I visited 2 counties in Virginia, 
4 in North Carolina, 1 in South Carolina, and 3 in Alabama. I 
everywhere met with a cordial reception from both white and colored 
people in the community where I stopped. With rare exceptions I 
found wretched conditions in the way of schoolhouses and school 
equipment. . 
As has been previously stated to the board, and especially to the 
members of the executive committee, all of our efforts the present 
year seem to be somewhat in the way of experiment and will supply 
data for information and discussion in the meeting of the executive 
committee soon to be held. The larger work and influence of the 
fund must, I think, be based upon actual accomplishment in the line 
of some constructive policy. My efforts during this first year have 
been largely directed toward getting some portion of the fund into 
use. In doing this I have had constantly in mind the policy which 
seemed announced in the very composition of this board, namely, 
union of effort. I believe this influence is already beginning to be 
felt. I am sure that whatever brings together the efforts of North 
and South is good. I was glad to hear a few days ago that a south- 
ern association is likely to assist a negro institution which has 
hitherto been entirely supported from the North. All such move- 
ments are good. With patience, tact, and wisdom I see no reason 
why there may not be a constant increase of harmony and coopera- 
tion in all the work that is being done for the education of the col- 
ored population of the South. 
   
        
       
    From SrareMent V, June 5, 1909. 
THE HENRICO PLAN. 
Members of the board may recall that in my last statement I men- 
tioned a plan of work which we have been carrying on in Henrico 
County, Va. I beg again to call the attention of the board to this 
plan, because it seems to me a most excellent one for us to adopt and 
promote as far as we can. 
In brief, the plan was this: We supplied the county superintendent 
with the salary for a competent teacher, whose duty it should be to 
introduce industrial work into the 22 colored rural schools of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-248
  236 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
county and to supervise the work. This teacher, Miss Virginia E. 
Randolph, began the work on October 26, 1908, and the schools closed 
June 1. She has spent her whole time in visiting these schools, some- 
times two or three a day, so that the schools have had the benefit not 
only of the industrial training, but of constant supervision, suggestion, 
and encouragement. It has also been a part of her work to form, in 
the various communities, organizations for school and home im- 
provement. 
Miss Randolph writes to me that the work of the schools is now 
on exhibition at the Henrico County Court House, and that the mem- 
bers of the Henrico board are agreeably surprised. I can state from 
letters received that the work is-very heartily approved by the county 
superintendent. j     
    
    
                        
    
                   MODIFICATION OF THE ABOVE PLAN. 
There are very many counties in which it would be impossible at 
present to carry out this plan. Whether from lack of schools, or the 
wide separation of those that exist, or the shortness of term, or the 
incompetence of the teachers, the plan would not yet be feasible. I 
find, however, that it will be possible in many places to adopt a modifi- 
cation of the plan; that is, we can supply the salary for a teacher 
at the most favorable point in the county, have this teacher give three 
or four days’ work to this school, and let her give the rest of her time 
to two, three, or four neighboring schools, with the intention of in- 
fluencing these schools and communities in the same manner as has 
been done in Henrico County. 
I have just returned from a trip through parts of Florida, Georgia, 
and Alabama, and at a number of places I found that this plan seemed 
feasible and that it met with very hearty approval. I believe that it 
can be carried out at most of the schools in which we have been sup- 
plying a teacher during the past session. The principals and school 
authorities whom I have so far heard from have approved the idea 
and have expressed a willingness to assist in carrying it out next 
session. 
FINANCIAL. 
I beg to report that during the present session, up to date, we have} 
paid out in salaries to teachers $14,011.50; in contribution toward| 
building and equipment, $1,965; and in contribution for extension of 
school term, $470. 
From STATEMENT V (SUPPLEMENTARY), JUNE 10, 1910. 
ADVANTAGE OF THE HENRICO PLAN. 
The great majority of the outlying rural schools are hopelessl 
isolated. They have practically no supervision. The work, so fai 
as I have been able to see, is crude and inefficient. The school build.
-P-A-G-E-249
    
EDUCATION OF THE COLORED RACE. 237 
ing, if there be one at all, shows neglect without and within. There 
is oftentimes not even the equipment which could be provided on the 
spot. I have seen benches supported on brickbats, holes in floors 
and roofs, doors and windows sagging, and other such signs of neglect 
which could easily be remedied. Neither within the school building 
nor on the school grounds is there any effort at tidiness. 
There are, of course, exceptions; but the picture is true for the 
great majority of cases, nor under all the circumstances should we be 
surprised that it is true. Yet it is these schools, and only these 
schools, which are within reach of the masses of children throughout 
the rural districts. 
Tt can readily be seen what a change might be effected in such 
schools, and in the neighborhood, by the supervision and the influence 
of a trained teacher, even if there were only two or three visits a 
month. 
From SratreMent VI, Jury 31, 1909. 
At a meeting of the executive committee held on July 1 the follow- 
ing expenditures during the first year. of the use of the fund were 
reported: For salary of teachers, $15,059 ; for building and equipment, 
$1,965; for extension of term, $547.50. Subject to the approval of 
the board at its next meeting, the committee agreed upon a tentative 
appropriation of $28,000 for carrying on the work. 
Several important matters were discussed, such as the appointment 
of an assistant to the president to aid in influencing legislation and 
public sentiment, the use of county organizers, and the gathering of 
reliable statistics. 
About three weeks ago an application came from State Supt. T. H. 
Harris, requesting that we supply to Louisiana a number of teachers 
to work in accordance with the Henrico plan. This is the first 
important business communication that has come from a state official. 
I may add that I know Professor Harris to be thoroughly interested 
in the improvement of the negro schools, and that he favors a fairer 
distribution of the school funds. Knowing his sentiments, I can not 
but think that we should do what we can to cooperate with him. 
COMMITTEE OF TWELVE FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE 
INTERESTS OF THE NEGRO RACE. 
The committee of twelve for the advancement of the interests of 
the negro race was appointed at a conference of prominent colored 
men held in the parlor of Carnegie Hall, New York City, January 
6, 7, and 8, 1904. At present, Booker T. Washington, president of 
Tuskegee Institute, Tuskegee, Ala., is chairman, and Hugh M.  
-P-A-G-E-250
  238 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
Browne, principal of Institute for Colored Youth, Cheyney, Pa., is 
secretary. 
The work of the committee thus far has been largely concerned with 
the civic rights of the colored man in the South, but a quotation from 
the proceedings of the appointing conference shows a favorable atti- 
tude toward the better education of the race. The conference held 
that the education of the negro race should consist of— 
(1) Thorough training of leaders and teachers in the higher institutions of 
learning. 
(2) Thorough elementary training for every negro child. 
(8) Industrial training of the masses in trades and handicrafts. 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOL FOR COLORED PERSONS—MARYLAND. 
The Maryland state board of education, in accordance with acts 
of the general assembly, session of 1908, has decided to establish State 
Normal School No. 3 in Montgomery County, and has purchased for 
the purpose a farm of 238 acres in that county. This normal school 
is for educating suitable colored persons, male and female, to become 
teachers in the colored schools of the State. Prof. George H. C. 
Williams has been elected principal by the state board. It is expected 
that the school will be opened in November, 1909. It is announced 
that, in addition to proper academic training, the mechanical arts and 
trades and agriculture for the males, and domestic science for the 
females, in all their branches, will be taught under the supervision of 
experts. 
The state board contemplates awarding one free scholarship to each 
county and three to Baltimore. Provision will also be made so that 
others who desire an education can attend the school and by moderate 
work cover their expenses. 
THE BEREA COLLEGE CASE. 
In 1904 the legislature of Kentucky enacted a law (Acts 1904, 
chap. 85, p. 181) making it “ unlawful for any person, corporation, 
or association of persons to maintain or operate any college, school, 
or institution where persons of the white and negro races are both 
received as pupils for instruction.” The law was contested by the 
authorities of Berea College, and the case was carried to the Supreme 
Court of the United States for final decision. The Supreme Court 
affirmed the decision of the court of appeals of Kentucky, that the 
right to teach white and negro children in a private school at the 
same time and place is not a property right, and that a corporation 
created by the State has no natural right to teach at all, but its right 
to teach is such as the State sees fit to give it. The State may with- 
hold it altogether or qualify it.

PROVISION FOR SPECIAL CLASSES, 239 
NEGRO FARMERS’ IMPROVEMENT SOCIETIES IN TEXAS. 
In Texas there are nearly 500 negro farmers’ improvement socie- 
ties. These are made up from 15 to 50 neighbors, who form a society 
for mutual encouragement in buying land, improving homes, keep- 
ing yards and fences in order, cultivating gardens, getting better 
stock, raising hogs and chickens, helping to improve schools, educat- 
ing their children, behaving well, and cultivating sociability. The 
members of these societies have begun to cooperate in business affairs, 
such as buying farm supplies, and later they aim to do the same in 
selling crops and produce. Anyone who tries honestly and perse- 
veringly can organize a farmers’ improvement society. (James H. 
Dillard.) 
XXI. PROVISION FOR SPECIAL CLASSES OF 
CHILDREN. 
  
CONFERENCE ON THE CARE OF DEPENDENT CHILDREN. 
On December 22, 1908, a request, signed by nine prominent men in- 
terested in the care of needy children, was directed to President 
Roosevelt, asking that a conference be called under his auspices, to 
meet in Washington in January, 1909, for the purpose of discussing 
and devising means of improving child-caring work in the country. 
In compliance with this request, the President three days later issued 
a call for a conference. 
Invitations to attend the conference were extended to over 200 
prominent workers, living in all parts of the United States. Among 
those invited were prominent pastors of Catholic and Protestant 
churches, Jewish rabbis, judges of juvenile and other courts, members 
of state boards of charities, educators, settlement workers, superin- 
tendents of orphan asylums and home-finding societies, and other 
leaders of this particular phase of philanthropic work. 
Pursuant to the call, the conference met in Washington on January 
25 and 26, 1909. Five sessions were held. President Roosevelt offi- 
ciated as chairman of the conference, the vice-chairmen being Hon. 
Homer Folks, secretary of the New York State Charities Aid Asso- 
ciation; Hon. Thomas M. Mulry, president of the St. Vincent de 
Paul Society of the United States; and Judge Julian W. Mack, ex- 
president of the National Conference of Jewish Charities; and the 
secretary, Mr. James E. West, secretary of the National Child-Rescue 
League. 
The conference devoted itself to a discussion of the nine proposi- 
tions contained in the memorandum accompanying President Roose-

velt’s letter of invitation and such other relevant questions as had 
been suggested by members of the conference. The conclusions of the 
conference, as incorporated in the report of the committee on resolu- 
tions, Dr. Hastings H. Hart, chairman, were as follows: 
1. Home care.—Children of worthy parents or deserving mothers should, as a 
rule, be kept with their parents at home. 
2. Preventive work.—Society should endeaver to eradicate causes of de- 
pendency like disease and to substitute compensation and insurance for relief. 
3. Home jfinding.—Homeless and neglected children, if normal, should be cared 
for in families when practicable. 
4, Cottage system.—Institutions should be on the cottage plan with small 
units, as far as possible. 
5. Incorporation.—Agencies caring for dependent children should be incor- 
porated, on approval of a suitable state board. 
6. State inspection.—The state should inspect the work of all agencies which 
care for dependent children. 
7. Inspection of educational work.—Educational work of institutions and 
agencies caring for dependent children should be supervised by state educational 
authorities. 
8. Facts and records.—Complete histories of dependent children and their 
parents should be recorded for guidance of child-caring agencies. 
9. Physical care——Every needy child should receive the best medical and 
surgical attention and be instructed in health and hygiene. 
10. Cooperation.—Local child-caring agencies should cooperate and establish 
joint bureaus of information. 
11. Undesirable legislation.—Prohibitive legislation against transfer of de- 
pendent children between States should be repealed. 
12. Permanent organization—A permanent organization for work along the 
lines of these resolutions is desirable. 
13. Federal children’s bureauw.—Bstablishment of a federal children’s bureau 
is desirable, and enactment of pending bill is earnestly recommended. 
14. Suggests special message to Congress favoring federal children’s bureau 
and other legislation applying above principles to District of Columbia and 
other federal territory. 
Pursuant to the last-mentioned recommendation, the President of 
the United States sent a special message to Congress, urging the 
establishment of a children’s bureau. Bills having that end in view 
were introduced in the Senate and the House of Representatives, but 
did not become law. 
COMPULSORY EDUCATION OF BLIND AND DEAF CHILDREN IN 
INDIANA. 
An act of the legislature of Indiana, approved March 6, 1909, re- 
quires the attendance at school, for a term or period of not less than 
that of the public school corporation where the child or children 
resides, of any blind or deaf child or children between the ages of 
8 and 16 years who are totally blind, deaf, or whose vision or hear- 
ing is so defective that they are unable to secure an education by

sight or hearing. Such child or children shall be required to attend 
the Indiana School for the Blind or the Indiana State School for the 
Deaf. 
UTAH COMMISSION FOR THE ADULT BLIND. 
The Utah commission for the adult blind was created by an act of 
the legislature approved March 22, 1909. It consists of the governor 
and four other members appointed by him, with the approval of the 
senate. The duties are to prepare and maintain a register of the adult 
blind in Utah; to establish, equip, and maintain one or more work- 
shops for the industrial training and employment of the adult blind; 
to maintain a bureau of information to assist in the finding of em- 
ployment and in the development of home industries for the adult 
blind; to furnish material and tools to adult blind persons; and to 
assist them in marketing their handiwork and products. The sum of 
$4,000 is appropriated for the purposes of the act. 
VACATION SCHOOLS FOR BACKWARD CHILDREN. 
Supt. William H. Maxwell, of the New York City public schools, 
has introduced in the vacation schools of that city summer classes for 
backward children. Such classes are organized in all the buildings 
where vacation schools are maintained, for the benefit of pupils who 
failed of promotion at the close of the spring term. Teachers are 
urged to enlist the interest of children who need the instruction 
contemplated. 
Doctor Maxwell points out that the increased influx in recent years 
of an inferior class of immigrants from southern Europe has been 
followed by a corresponding increase in mental defectives and delin- 
quents among school children. It is to correct, as far as possible, this 
condition that schools for backward children are maintained in vaca- 
tion time. 
XXII. SOME EDUCATIONAL EXPERIMENTS. 
Private schools offer opportunity for experiments in education, 
many of which prove to be of permanent and universal value and 
eventually modify entire systems of education. England is pre- 
eminently a country of private schools—that is, schools free from 
official restraints. The national character has been formed in institu- 
tions of this class, and their value as centers of new and fruitful in- 
fluences is abundantly illustrated by the work of Thring at Upping- 
ham and of Arnold at Rugby.

  242 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
Among private institutions in England embodying features or prin- 
ciples which are still in an experimental stage, the following are 
typical examples of coeducation boarding schools: Bedales, for boys 
and girls from 7 to 19 years of age, founded in 1893 by Mr. J. H. 
Badley, who had been an assistant master at Abbotsholme, and who 
transferred some features of the latter to the new establishment; Kes- 
wick School, founded in 1898 by the Rev. Cecil Grant, with the pur- 
pose of educating “ boys and girls together as far as possible on public 
school principles ” (“ public schools ” meaning endowed schools, such 
as Eton, Rugby, etc.). 
Abbotsholme, it may be explained, was founded by Dr. Cecil Reddie 
in 1889, for the purpose of educating “ boys of the directing classes 
according to the latest scientific principles.” The institution occupies 
a fine estate of 134 acres, extending on both sides of the River Dove, 
which divides Derbyshire from Staffordshire, and affording every 
facility for outdoor exercise and for the special forms of education 
which are conducted in garden and field. The latest prospectus of 
the school says: 
The curriculum is carefully planned to cover seven years. In conjunction with 
the school life, it provides an all-around education, free, as far as possible, from 
specialization up to the age of 17 or 18. It develops all sides of the boy’s nature 
harmoniously, brings him into intimate relation with nature and human life, 
teaches him to think for himself, and develops his power of initiative. 
The linguistic studies include a careful training in English, French, and 
German, taught according to the modern natural system; that is, by speaking 
as well as writing. Latin follows, and in some cases Greek, but the central aim 
in the linguistic studies is to give the boy a real scholarly grasp of his mother 
tongue, .*.. %)* 
On the side of nature study the elements of all the chief natural sciences are 
taught in intimate connection with mathematics, and largely in the open air in 
connection with work on the estate, in the garden, and on the school farm. This 
side of the boy’s life is intimately connected with the training in drawing, 
painting, modeling, and woodwork, all of which are compulsory. To create an 
interest in pictures and sculpture is a prominent feature of the school, the 
various rooms and corridors being used as picture galleries. Through this it is 
hoped every boy will be trained to appreciate art in all its chief forms. Through- 
out the school there is systematic teaching of hygiene and economics, the boys 
in this connection having a very essential share in the government and organi- 
zation of the place. 
The most important aim of the school is, of course, effective moral and re- 
ligious teaching. The latter is, as far as possible, unsectarian, leaving the 
peculiar tenets of particular religious bodies to be dealt with in each boy’s home. 
The school has its own liturgy printed at the school press. This contains, in 
addition to the ordinary daily morning and evening services, special services 
for the great church festivals. It also provides services for certain days of 
national rejoicing, such as Trafalgar Day. Other yearly festivals, which add a 
charm to the school life, are the parents’ gathering, the harvest home, founda- 
tion day, and the neighbors’ Christmas gathering; and one of the chief events 
of the year is the old boys’ gathering, covering five days, at Easter.
-P-A-G-E-255
    SOME EDUCATIONAL EXPERIMENTS. 243 
Abbotsholme has attracted wide attention, in particular, through 
the interest excited by the work of M. Edmond Demolins, on the supe- 
riority of the Anglo-Saxons,* in which this school was presented as 
the nucleus of an ideal society. Several schools have been established 
on the Continent, in which the principal features of Abbotsholme 
have been adopted in whole or in part. The best known of these con- 
tinental experiments is the Ecole (Nouvelle) des Roches, near Ver- 
neuil, department of Eure, France, founded in 1899 by M. Edmond 
Demolins himself. 
The distinction between England and France, in regard to the pos- 
sibilities of private initiative in education, is indicated by M. Steeg, 
in his report to the Chamber of Deputies on the budget for 1909, 
elsewhere referred to in this report. Discussing the need of changes 
in the scheme of liberal education in France, M. Steeg says: 
It is of little use to invite the aid of private initiative. The example of the 
Anglo-Saxons is often held up to us. Some establishments modeled after Eng- 
lish precedents have been created in France. M. Lavisse has welcomed their 
appearance on account of their freedom to try experiments before which the 
university (state teaching system) hesitates through indecision or helplessness. 
“We bear the weight of ages, which is enormous,” says this eminent master; 
“we are the servants of the State, which loves neither changes in purpose nor 
divided purposes.” Furthermore, these colleges have been instituted by wealthy 
capitalists for the children of the rich, and, indeed, the very rich, and this ena- 
bles them to view with such happy indifference the programmes and the sanc- 
tions of secondary education. 
In fact, private secular secondary education does not in reality exist among 
us. At Paris some valuable establishments still maintain their existence, as 
Sainte-Barbe and the Ecole Alsacienne, which have been, and still are, useful 
fields of experiment. What, however, would have become of these products of 
private initiative if they had not secured at critical moments the moral support 
of the university and material support from the budget of public instruction? 
Between the state college and the church college there is no longer any place 
for private education worthy of the name. If it exists in England, if it is 
indeed prosperous, this is because “ the weight of ages” does not operate there 
in the same way and in the same sense as with us. 
Among important experiments in industrial education may be 
noted the efforts going on in many countries for the revival or de- 
velopment of local industries. Ireland affords interesting proof of 
the value of such experiments, particularly the work of the Royal 
Trish Industries Association, which was founded about twenty-five 
years ago by the Countess of Aberdeen for the purpose of aiding the 
Irish peasantry in the establishment of home industry, such as the 
making of lace, embroidery, and knitting. The work is now done on 
a large scale throughout Ireland. All articles are sent to the central 
office of the association, and from there are distributed and sold in all

parts of the world, the proceeds going to the poor girls who do the 
work. 
Each county in Ireland has its own industries—some rugs and 
tweeds, others laces and embroidery. Among the peasantry of Kil- 
lJarney the industry is basket making and furniture. The girls are 
taught by experts in the various branches of the work; the products 
are taken by the association and the profits are turned over to the 
girls. 
The Government has recently aided in the endeavor by grants 
made to local committees for the purpose of enabling them to pro- 
vide instruction for workers in various forms of -cottage industries, 
such as lace and crochet making, embroidery, and drawn-thread work. 
Peculiar interest attaches to an endeavor to alleviate the misfor- 
tunes of the Boers resulting from the war with England by intro- 
ducing the spinning and weaving industry in the Transvaal and 
Orange River Colony. The spirit that prompted the enterprise is 
indicated in the following account of its beginnings: 
Two young Englishwomen—Miss Hobhouse and Miss Clark, the latter a grand- 
daughter of John Bright—on seeing the misery were stirred to help it, and, like 
true Englishwomen, devised a thoroughly practical way in which to do it. 
Why, they asked, should not these people, who can raise wool, spin and weave 
it, instead of sending their fleeces to other lands and getting in return, at great 
cost, the material for garments and bedding? ‘To be sure, there was no wood 
nor coal; there were no factories; hardly even means of transportation, as we 
should look upon it. Undaunted, they went to work in England not only to 
raise money to buy hand looms and spinning wheels, but they entered the fac- 
tories and learned how to dye, to spin, to “ warp up” a hand loom, to weave, 
and many more processes which could be of avail in South Africa. 
Miss Hobhouse was the pioneer as a teacher. Going back to the Boer country, 
she selected a remote village, Philippolis, in the Orange River Colony, where a 
good clergyman, who for forty years had shepherded his flock there, was eager 
to help her. In this obscure spot a little school for teaching fireside industries 
was opened by Miss Hobhouse on the 13th of March, 1905. It seems incredible 
that it could be of such recent date when we hear what that small beginning 
has resulted in. 
The school began with 6 girls. In a little more than six months 40 had been 
trained. The success was so immediate that interest was soon aroused in the 
Transvaal as well as in the Orange River Colony, and in August another school 
was started near Johannesburg, with a Swedish teacher, whose experience in 
her own country, where such beautiful work is done on hand looms, made her 
an admirable assistant in this new undertaking® 
According to a report issued in 1907, two years after the experiment 
was started, 22 teachers were then teaching spinning in as many 
villages.

  CHAPTER III. 
STATE EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS. 
By Cuartezs S. Foos, 
Superintendent of Public Schools, Reading, Pa. 
The temper of the present epoch is iconoclastic. In every depart- 
ment of human activity men and women are caviling at existing con- 
ditions. To be sure, some criticism is constructive, but much of it is 
destructive. Its seeming intent is not to build up, but to tear down; 
to extirpate, not to foster. Its tone is not optimistic, but pessimistic. 
The public-school system of America is to-day a victim of this cap- 
tious censure. If any pupil of the public schools fails to make good 
at any point, immediately there is a hysterical rhapsody against the 
public schools. Even educational organizations have not escaped 
the relentless causticity of newspaper and periodical writers. Edu- 
cational associations, they frequently write, are the forum for vagary 
instead of principle; are a drawback instead of an uplift to peda- 
gogical progress; are autocratic instead of democratic in their in- 
fluence. 
In spite, however, of this tendency, the public educational system 
will continue to grow and improve, and educational associations will 
flourish and broaden their functions and influence. This instinct to 
organize developed with the human race. From the earliest times 
men have banded together. At first, this disposition to group was 
for protection; as time went on, it was to improve physical condi- 
tions; and still later, for intellectual purposes. This inherent ten- 
dency in men to combine brought about the historic movements of 
the world. Organization of men resulted in the exodus from Egypt; 
in the formation of the Christian religion; in the abolition of slavery 
in this country; in the establishment of all that has been worth 
while. Benjamin Franklin foresaw the value of organization, and 
he devoted his genius to the organization of his fellow-citizens into 
groups for specific purposes, the greatest of which was the union of 
the colonies. 
DATE OF ORGANIZATION. 
Early in the history of education the need of meetings for exchange 
of views was evident. From the first days of the schoolmaster men 
have conferred in the interest of the betterment of educational proc- 
251 
 
-P-A-G-E-264
    
252 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
esses. These gatherings at first were informal and their results 
meager, but from crude beginnings have evolved the present helpful 
educational societies. Soon after the establishment of the public 
schools state organizations appeared, and this is the theme of my 
paper. So far as data are available, Rhode Island and Massachusetts 
have the oldest state educational bodies; both were organized in 1845. 
New York followed in 1846; Connecticut in 1847; Ohio in 1849; 
Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin in 1853; Illinois, Indiana, 
Towa, and New Hampshire in 1854; New Jersey in 1855. Other 
dates of organization are as follows: Minnesota, 1861; Missouri, 1862; 
Kansas, 1863; Maryland, 1866; California, Georgia, and Tennessee, 
1867; Arkansas, 1869; Kentucky, 1872; Colorado, 1875; Alabama, 
1882; South Dakota, 1883; North Carolina, 1884; New Mexico and 
Mississippi, 1886; North Dakota, 1887; Wyoming and Louisiana, 
1892. To-day every State and Territory, except Delaware, has an 
educational or teachers’ association. 
PLAN OF ORGANIZATION. 
The general plan of the various state educational associations for 
teachers is somewhat similar, but in detail they differ materially. 
Some are more elaborate than others. Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, In- 
diana, Wisconsin, Kansas, Louisiana, and Missouri are among those 
having extensive plans of organization. Tennessee, apparently, has 
the simplest plan of operation, holding only a general session. Cali- 
fornia centralizes authority in an admirable manner in a board of 
directors. There is no agreement in the scheme of organization. In 
the 47 associations there are at least 50 different departments. The 
plan of organizing is based largely on the several divisions of edu- 
cational work, although most have departments in branches of study 
as well as in school departments. Maryland has no departments, 
although there is a high-school teachers’ association in the State. 
Iowa subordinates the sections or round tables to the departments. 
It has four departments—college and university, county superin- 
tendents, normal and secondary, elementary and graded departments. 
These departments have the authority to crganize round tables. The 
elementary and graded department consists of these sections: super- 
intendents and principals, penmanship and drawing, primary, library 
and school directors. North Dakota has five departments—college 
and normal, high school, elementary education, county superintend- 
ents, and school directors. Rhode Island has four—high school, 
grammar school, primary and kindergarten, country and village 
school. Connecticut, on the other hand, organizes sections by branches 
of study and has sections in history, literature, physical training, 
manual arts, and music.

STATE EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS. 253 
The most frequent departments are: high school, elementary educa- 
tion, music, art and manual training, college, kindergartens, primary 
schools, county superintendents. Less frequent departments are: 
graded schools, school boards, rural schools, secondary schools, city 
superintendents, history, science, mathematics, grammar grades, phys- 
ical training, child study, normal school work, drawing, elocution, 
and reading. Missouri, Indiana, Louisiana, New Hampshire, and 
Colorado have departments of the classics; Maryland and Indiana, 
study of English; Maryland, study of history; Maryland, Colorado, 
Wisconsin, and Indiana, modern languages; Indiana and Arkansas, 
athletics; Illinois and Nebraska, principals; Arkansas, county ex- 
aminers; Michigan, school commissioners and education of the deaf; 
Michigan and Colorado, library; North Dakota and Pennsylvania, 
directors; Alabama, industrial arts and school improvements; Wis- 
consin and Pennsylvania, nature study; Wisconsin, domestic science; 
Connecticut, penmanship; New York, commercial teachers. Louis- 
iana has a department in civic effort. 
EDUCATIONAL COUNCILS. 
A council of education is a prominent factor in California, Colo- 
rado, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Wisconsin, Iowa, Mississippi, 
Missouri, New Mexico, and Idaho. The aim of the educational coun- 
cil in these States varies somewhat, but may be tersely summed up in 
the words of the Idaho constitution: “'To direct the educational 
agencies of the State and to prosecute original investigation in edu- 
cation.” In several States it serves as a central body for the affilia- 
tion of various educational and semieducational bodies. The mem- 
bership is generally made up of representatives from the various 
departments of the association, from affiliated organizations, colleges, 
and other educational bodies. 
The council in Massachusetts aims to unify and secure the coopera- 
tion of all the educational agencies of the State, to discuss and devise 
plans for increasing the efficiency of education, and to promote nec- 
essary legislation. The membership comprises the president of the 
state association and the secretary of the state board of education, ex 
officio; 24 delegates from the state teachers’ association; 5 each from 
the New England Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools, 
the Massachusetts Schoolmasters’ Club, and the Massachusetts Super- 
intendents’ Association; 3 delegates each from the New Eugland Nor- 
mal Council, the High School Masters’ Club, the Boston Association 
of School Principals, the Boston Teachers’ Club, and the Harvard 
Teachers’ Association; 1 each from the various county associations 
and any other educational organizations desiring to be represented, 
provided that the total membership shall not exceed 100. 
 
-P-A-G-E-266
    
254 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
The membership of the Missouri council comprises 3 members of 
each department, 12 members elected at large, 4 each year for a three- 
year term, and the following ex officio members: College presidents 
of the Missouri College Union; dean of Teachers’ College and nor- 
mal presidents, presidents and ex-presidents of the Missouri State 
Teachers’ Association, ex-state superintendents, city superintendents, 
and assistant superintendents. 
The Colorado Association Council is composed of representatives 
of the sectional departments on a ratio to be determined by the di- 
rectors and revised by them every three years.: The council itself elects 
6 members. This council considers matters referred to it by the asso- 
ciations; communicates with the directors respecting the work and 
welfare of the association; discusses advanced educational topics; pro- 
poses educational reforms in legislation and practice; stimulates and 
maintains a local interest in the National Educational Association; 
and cooperates in every practical way with the progressive educa- 
tional forces of the State and county. 
Towa provides an educational council, of which the superintendent 
of public instruction is chairman. The elective members are: six to 
be elected from the association, 6 from the college and university 
department, 6 from the county superintendents’ department, 6 from 
the normal and secondary department, 12 from the elementary and 
grade department, 6 by the educational council itself. The term is 
three years. Members, except those elected by the council itself, are 
not eligible to immediate reelection. The duties of the council are 
to recommend ways and means to adjust and control the educational 
forces and agencies of the State. 
The Mississippi council consists of 15 members of the association, 
elected for six years, half by the council and half by the executive 
committee. All ex-members become honorary members. 
Wisconsin has 9 members in its council, representing the various 
educational interests of the State. The appointments are approved 
by the association. The council acts on resolutions referred to it 
involving educational questions. The council may recommend any 
educational questions upon which action may be desirable. 
The California council of education consists of the members of the 
state board of education and 35 representatives elected by the asso- 
ciation, 7 elected each year for five years. The council acts as a 
special educational advisory committee of the association, and its 
special duty is to report annually to the general association desirable 
legislation and ways and means for securing the same, together with 
pedagogical recommendations, which are the outcome of their con- 
ferences. California proposes to affiliate its Various associations of 
teachers in an educational council.
-P-A-G-E-267
    
STATE EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS. 255 
The New Hampshire council consists of the state superintendent ; 
1 member elected annually by each county or district teachers’ asso- 
ciation; 6 members of tlie state association, 2 elected annually for a 
term of three years; 1 member from the association of academic and 
private schools, elected annually; 1 member from the state normal 
school; 1 member from each of the colleges—Dartmouth and the 
Agricultural and Mechanic Arts College. Each association or body 
represented in the council pays an annual fee of $5 for each member 
representing it. This council chooses its own officers and adopts its 
own rules. It holds its meeting at least one month before the annual 
meeting of the state association, and reports to that body. 
READING CIRCLES AND BOOK LISTS. 
A number of state bodies conduct state reading circles. In Georgia 
the library board prepares annually a list of the reading matter for 
the pupils of the public schools and for the teachers. New York, 
Illinois, Kentucky, and Nebraska prepare lists of books suitable for 
children, and current juvenile literature. Other state associations 
that encourage reading circles are: Mississippi, Indiana, Missouri, 
Ohio, Maryland, Arkansas, Virginia, and Colorado. 
COMMITTEES. 
Committees differ in the several associations. Resolutions, audit- 
ing, necrology, legislation, and nominating are the prevailing com- 
mittees. Other less popular committees are: enrollment, president’s 
address, educational progress, printing or publication, and finance. 
New York has a committee to present at the final session a résumé of 
the annual meeting. New Jersey has also a committee on résumé, 
that prepares for publication abstracts of all papers read. Minnesota 
and Illinois have a committee to arrange for state representation to 
the National Education Association. Illinois has a committee on 
appropriations, that passes on proposed expenditures; Missouri, Ohio, 
and Iowa a committee on teachers’ situations. This committee acts 
for persons wishing to teach and persons desiring to employ teachers. 
Illinois authorizes a committee on simplified spelling, the teaching of 
physiology and hygiene, and state course of study ; Mississippi, normal 
schools; Alabama, memoirs and good of the profession; Wyoming and 
Vermont, school laws; Michigan, school commissioners; New Jersey, 
retirement fund; Wisconsin, honorary members; Louisiana appoints 
a committee on the investigation of school problems and a committee 
of parish managers to create an interest in the association and to 
secure members. 
Except the nominating committee, almost invariably these com- 
mittees are appointed by the president; New Hampshire and Louisi- 
   
-P-A-G-E-268
  256 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
ana elect a legislative committee. In New Hampshire the president 
appoints a nominating committee of 10—1 from each county—and in 
Illinois 1 from each congressional district. —In New York the presi- 
dent appoints a committee of 7, composed of at least 1 member from 
each of the special educational associations of the State, to present 
candidates for all offices except president. In Massachusetts the presi- 
dent appoints 14. Wisconsin and Ohio also appoint this committee. 
In Iowa each department selects 8 members of a nominating com- 
mittee. New Jersey provides for a nominating committee of 1 man 
and 1 woman from each congressional district, elected by the members 
of that district. Independent nominations must be signed by 3 mem- 
bers from each congressional district. The Colorado association has 
a scheme of “ nominators,” 11 from the sections and the same number 
from the association, who nominate officers. Pennsylvania elects a 
nominating committee. The Idaho nominating committee consists of 
2 persons elected from each authorized section and 1 person appointed 
by the president. Members of each congressional district in Missouri 
and Kansas elect 1 member, and in Nebraska 3 members, of the nomi- 
nating committee. 
OFFICERS. 
The officers in most associations consist of a president, one or more 
vice-presidents, a secretary, a treasurer, an executive committee or a 
board of directors. Several States have a railway secretary or rail- 
way manager, an assistant secretary, a corresponding secretary, a 
recording secretary; a number have both a recording and a corre- 
sponding secretary. Indiana has a permanent secretary elected for 
life. Massachusetts has three assistant secretaries; New York elects 
an assistant treasurer; North Carolina and Tennessee, a secretary- 
treasurer; Arkansas, Georgia, and other States, a board of trustees; 
Maine and Connecticut, an auditor; Utah, a custodian, who is chair- 
man of the auditing committee and has charge of all papers; Michi- 
gan, a superintendent of exhibits. 
NOMINATION AND ELECTION OF OFFICERS—TERM. 
Officers are, as a rule, elected annually by ballot where there is 
more than one candidate, or viva voce or by the ballot of the secretary 
where there is only one candidate for an office. Generally, candidates 
for office are recommended by the nominating committee, although 
in a number of instances nominations are made in open sessions. West 
Virginia, Maine, and Ohio elect by ballot or by such method as the 
association shall direct; the first State elects a secretary and treasurer 
for two years and nominates all candidates for office in open session. 
In some States, notably Wisconsin, Louisiana, and Kentucky, secreta- 
   
-P-A-G-E-269
STATE EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS. 257 
ries are elected for three years. Asa rule, the executive committee or 
board of directors are elected, although in a few instances they are 
appointed by the president. North Carolina elects all officers by 
ballot, unless otherwise determined by a viva voce vote of two-thirds 
of the members present. In New York the annual election of officers 
occurs between the hours of 11 a. m. and 2 p. m. on the second day 
of the sessions. A plurality vote elects. The election is under the 
direction of three inspectors appointed by the president. Voting is 
by ballot, unless waived by unanimous consent of the members of the 
association present. Michigan elects the president by ballot, a major- 
ity vote being necessary for a choice. The election takes place between 
11 a. m. and 12.30 p. m. on the second day of the annual meeting. In 
Illinois the ballot is taken in such manner as the executive committee 
may prescribe. In South Dakota officers are elected by ballot, with 
polls open one and one-half hours. In Louisiana the names of per- 
sons nominated are placed upon a printed slip under proper heading, 
and members strike off the names of those for whom they will not 
vote. Polls are open to 8 p. m. of the day preceding the last day of 
the session. 
In Wisconsin the president and one member of the executive com- 
mittee are elected annually. All other officers are elected on nomina- 
tions made by the committee on elections, consisting of 10 members, 
5 of whom are appointed every year for a term of two years. This 
committee establishes polling places in the building in which general 
sessions are held, which are open from 9 a. m. to 5 p.m. Three judges 
are in charge of each polling place. Membership tickets have attached 
one nominating ballot and one election ballot for each officer to be 
elected. No other tickets are permitted. If any person receives a 
majority of the votes cast for any office, he is declared elected. If 
not, the two persons receiving the highest vote for any office are the 
nominees. A second election is then held on the second day, the names 
of the nominees being posted at the polling places and in other con- 
spicuous places. 
Minnesota nominates its candidates for the several offices at a 
primary election at an established polling place. A separate ballot 
is provided for each office to be filled. Candidates are presented by 
a committee on nominations, consisting. of three members appointed 
by the president and one member from each of the various sections. 
Members may vote for candidates on presentation of membership 
certificate or other satisfactory evidence. The nominating committee 
presents to the convention the names of candidates securing more 
than 20 per cent of the total vote cast. The election is held on the 
last day of the convention, in a similar manner. The polling place 
is open from 9 a. m. to 2 p. m.

WHO MAY BECOME MEMBERS—CLASSES OF MEMBERSHIP. 
Membership is generally limited to persons directly or indirectly 
interested in education. New York and Virginia elect only persons 
actively engaged in any branch of educational work. In Maryland 
all persons in any way connected with the work of public school edu- 
cation may be active members; all friends of education in the State, 
associate members; other distinguished persons, honorary members. 
Pennsylvania and Mississippi invite all friends of education; Indiana 
and Kansas, active friends of education; Wisconsin, Maine, and 
Idaho, persons interested in education; Michigan and Vermont, any 
person. New Jersey receives only teachers, principals, supervisors, 
superintendents, or persons holding certificates valid in that State; 
West Virginia admits to active membership persons engaged in edu- 
cational work and to associate membership persons interested in edu- 
cational work; Georgia extends membership also to persons associated 
with libraries and publications. In Virginia persons desiring mem- 
bership in the educational association join a local association most 
convenient. Local associations may be organized by five eligible 
persons. Louisiana has an active and an honorary membership— 
active, composed of public school teachers and superintendents; 
honorary, of parish officers and private school teachers. 
The usual classes of membership are active and associate, or active 
and honorary; occasionally active, associate, and honorary. Sev- 
eral States, notably California, Tennessee, and Pennsylvania, make 
no distinction. Most States provide for life membership, but this is 
contingent upon the payment of a certain fee. Ohio and Kentucky 
have a permanent membership for such as pay their dues regularly. 
New Jersey has two members at large.

In the majority of associations the anuual dues are $1; in Kansas, 
Utah, and Maryland, 50 cents; in a number of other associations, not- 
ably Maine, New. Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, New Jersey, 
Indiana, Michigan, South Carolina, and Wisconsin, the dues are 50 
cents for women and $1 for men; in Connecticut, 50 cents for men and 
25 cents for women. West Virginia assesses active members $1 and 
associate members 50 cents; Nevada, $1 biennially. In a few associ- 
ations applicants pay an enrollment fee and annual dues. For in- 
stance, in Minnesota, North Dakota, Illinois, and Georgia the enroll- 
ment fee is $1 and the annual dues $1. In North Carolina the enroll- 
ment fee is $2 and the annual dues $2; Kansas has a membership fee 
of $1, dues 50 cents; Washington, an initiation fee of 25 cents, annual 
dues 25 cents; Vermont, membership fee, $1 for men and 50 cents for 
women, annual dues the same. Local associations in Virginia assess

memoers 50 cents, half of which must be turned over to the state 
organization. The majority of States enroll life members for $10; 
North Carolina charges $25. In Colorado and West Virginia any 
member paying $10 or $1 annually for fifteen years becomes a life 
member. In California the life membership entails the payment of 
fifteen years in advance or 20 consecutive annual payments. In Ne- 
braska the life membership is $5; in New York, $10 for men and $5 
for women. Massachusetts assesses $1 for life membership. As 
there are no annual dues in this State, the board of directors has au- 
thority to levy an assessment, but no assessments have ever been 
levied. The revenues are derived from the State ($300) and a collec- 
tion authorized by tradition. 
OFFICIAL NAME. 
The official names of the several associations differ somewhat in 
phraseology. The Rhode Island teachers’ association is “'The Rhode 
Island Institute of Instruction,” and the North Carolina association 
is “ The North Carolina Teachers’ Assembly.” The Louisiana organi- 
zation is “ The Louisiana State Public School Teachers’ Association,” 
and that of West Virginia is “The West Virginia Education Asso- 
ciation.” Of the other organizations, the most popular title is: 
“ State Teachers’ Association,” 22 having this name, as follows: Con- 
necticut, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Michigan, 
Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New 
York, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Ver- 
mont, Virginia, and Wyoming. Nine are named “ Educational Asso- 
ciation,” as follows: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Minne- 
sota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Washington. 
Ten are named “ Teachers’ Association,” as follows: Arizona, Arkan- 
sas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Ohio, 
Utah, and Wisconsin. Two—Pennsylvania and Nevada—bear the 
name of “ State Educational Association.” 
CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES OF THE VARIOUS ASSOCIATIONS. 
Characteristic features of the various state associations lend inter- 
est to this investigation. The Alabama association regulations differ 
from those of many States in that they invite each school board in 
the State to send at least one representative to the annual meeting, 
and limit papers to thirty minutes; discussions to ten. To settle 
difficult questions and to exalt professional ideals, Alabama has a 
code of ethics which every teacher in America should read twice 
each year. In this Commonwealth, as in other Southern States, there 
is a state association for colored teachers. 
The Arizona association meets in connection with joint county 
institutes, and all join the association.
-P-A-G-E-272
  260 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
Arkansas rouses its teachers through vice-presidents in each con- 
gressional district and invites to membership persons interested in 
library work. The board of trustees controls the finances of the asso- 
ciation, audits bills and accounts, and directs expenditures. At the 
opening session the chairman of the local committee presides until 
the president delivers his annual address. 
California has very complete and specific by-laws. During the 
past four years the teachers’ association in this State has, as one of its 
leading members writes, “ abandoned the hit or miss manner of con- 
ducting the affairs of the association.” Beginning with July 1, 1909, 
a secretary devotes all his time to the work of the association, at a 
salary of $2,400 a year. The association also publishes a high-class 
educational monthly. Other characteristic features are: Nine di- 
rectors elected by ballot, having corporate powers; president, sole 
charge of the preparation of the programme; secretary, elected by the 
board of directors; no nominating speeches permitted. 
Colorado, in addition to its general sessions, assembles in 12 depart- 
ments, mainly divided by branches of study that qualify their own 
members. Any department that fails to meet in separate session for 
deliberation and action forfeits its organization, as it does when it 
falls below 20 members. 
Connecticut prefers a one-day session with meetings at both Hart- 
ford and New Haven. In 1908 the general meeting was held in New 
Haven in the morning and in Hartford in the afternoon. Sectional 
meetings were the reverse. The programme and participants were the 
same at each meeting. A business meeting was held in Meriden the 
following day, and this body was composed of 20 delegates, 10 elected 
in each meeting. The slogan of the conventions was inspiration, 
rather than information. 
Florida secures a good ‘enrollment through the efforts of the county 
superintendents. 
Georgia also dignifies its membership by a code of ethics. A board 
of directors takes the place of the usual executive committee, and a 
board of trustees regulates the finances. On account of a hotel agree- 
ment one meeting in three must be held at Cumberland Island. 
Idaho pays the expenses of teachers attending meetings of the asso- 
ciation. Enrollment blanks are sent the teachers. <A president is not 
eligible to reelection for three years. 
The Illinois organization consists of the usual officers; a board of 
directors; 9 sections, 1 of which is a village principals’ section. 
Illinois has a permanent committee of two members from each de- 
partment that considers all questions referred to it by the associa- 
tion and reports thereon at the next annual meeting. 
The Indiana association elects 7 vice-presidents and an execu- 
tive committee of 7, distributed in the several congressional districts. 
 
-P-A-G-E-273
   STATE EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS. 261 
Unusual sections of the 16 in this association are: One for elocution 
and 1 for institute instructors. The latter section discusses the 
institute as an agency in education. 
Iowa, on recommendation of 20 members of the association, adds 
anew department. At the request of 10 members, a round table may 
be established. 
Kansas, at its meetings, has round tables on the several school 
branches, such as modern languages, foreign languages, mathematics, 
etc. The association presents a silk flag to the county having the 
highest enrolled membership in proportion to the number of teachers 
employed in the county. Two prize libraries are given for the best 
attendance. In reference to enrollment, the report says: “ Profes- 
sional benefits involve professional obligations; if we receive the 
benefits, let us not neglect the obligations.” The vice-presidents of 
the association represent the executive committee in the several de- 
partments. Only persons employed in distinctively educational work 
are permitted to vote or hold office. The executive committee may 
expend $100 to maintain state headquarters at the meeting of the 
National Education Association. 
Kentucky regards its association as the teachers’ parliament to 
fight its battles, and as such declares it should receive their moral 
and material support. It has a relief committee to assist worthy 
members. It has two classes of members, permanent and temporary. 
The permanent are those who agree to pay their dues yearly and may 
hold office. The executive committee consists of the regular officers, 
1 member from the board of directors, and the presidents of the 
sections. 
Louisiana instructs its secretary at the close of each annual meeting 
to furnish treasurer a list of absent members in order to collect 
unpaid annual dues. Members who are absent from three successive 
meetings and who fail to pay dues three successive years are dropped. 
This association elects two vice-presidents—one lady and one gen- 
tleman. 
The Maine association urges library workers to join its ranks. The 
secretary registers members. The executive committee consists of 
the president, vice-president, secretary, treasurer, corresponding sec- 
retary, and one member elected by the association. 
Maryland promotes pedagogical investigation and study in the 
branches of the public school curriculum through nine standing com- 
mittees, appointed by the president. The topics are English, geog- 
raphy and history, mathematics, natural science, «esthetics, physical 
training, manual training, kindergarten, modern language. The 
committees report in writing at the annual meeting. 
The Massachusetts association is under the general superintendence 
of a board of 40 directors, 20 representing the state association and 
       
-P-A-G-E-274
   
      
262 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
20 the various counties, the latter elected either by county associa- 
tions or by the teachers of the counties. 
Michigan conducts its association as a state institute. Every mo- 
tion and resolution must be submitted in writing. AI] discussions 
must be without manuscript. Teachers may close their schools and 
attend without loss of pay, upon certificate of attendance. Various 
colleges, normal schools, societies, etc., announce reunions and ban- 
quets in the official bulletin. A significant feature at the 1908 meet- 
ing at Saginaw was school visiting. 
Minnesota had for its theme at the 1909 meeting, “ Efficiency in 
Education.” 
Mississippi has committees on superintendent’s salary, course of 
study, and libraries. This association limits expenses of each annual 
meeting to two-thirds of the receipts of the previous meeting. Ten 
active members may ask for a department. It has a committee on 
investigations. 
Missouri arranges extensively for the local entertainment of mem- 
bers. The executive committee is composed of 6 members. The ex- 
penses of each annual meeting are also limited to two-thirds of the 
receipts of each year.. 
Montana, in addition to strong programmes, has receptions, con- 
certs, and indoor athletic exhibitions. In 1908 meetings of the Inter- 
scholastic Athletic Association, Montana State Library Association, 
and other societies were held at the same time. Its section meetings 
are reported as superb. 
Nebraska eliminates factional controversy by having the members 
from each congressional district elect three members of a nominating 
committee that choose officers. Teachers from each congressional 
district assemble in separate bodies and each elects without nomina- 
tions, first by informal ballot, and second by formal ballot. Recep- 
tions to societies and officers are features. Conferences are held in 
the professional training of teachers, in popular medical education, 
and in specific subjects, such as German, Latin, history, and other 
branches. 
The Nevada State Educational Association meets biennially. In 
the odd year district institutes convene and work on instructions 
from and report to the state association. Its executive committee 
consists of one principal or superintendent of city graded schools, 
one principal of a county high school, one deputy superintendent, 
one grade teacher, one trustee, one member of the faculty of 
the University of Nevada, together with the president and corre- 
sponding secretary. This committee has power to organize disttict 
institutes,

New Hampshire issues an interesting “declaration of beliefs and 
desires,” in which it reviews legislation enacted and the result. Its 
legislative committee comprises 1 member from each county in the 
State. The executive committee comprises the president, vice-presi- 
dent, secretary, treasurer, and 2 other members elected annually. 
New Jersey provides for an enrollment committee consisting of not 
less than 1 member from each county. The legislative committee 
consists of 1 member from each congressional district. A desirable 
feature is a committee on educational progress that each year makes 
timely suggestions. 
The New Mexico Association has in its council, besides the mem- 
bers from the association, as advisory members, such citizens of New 
Mexico as in the judgment of the regular members may be desirable. 
The New York association has a committee of 61, one from each 
county, on legislation and professional interest. Other educational 
societies affiliate with the state association. The president, with the 
advice of the executive committee, arranges the programmes for the 
annual meeting. Four-fifths of the receipts from life membership 
are invested and only the interest used. 
North Carolina elects officers viva voce by a vote of two-thirds 
of the members present. No member may vote in more than one 
department and each member may select the department. It empha- 
sizes sectional meetings. The various sections hold from three to four 
meetings each, and general sessions are held only in the evening. 
North Dakota by law authorizes:the state superintendent to pub- 
lish as public matter 2,500 copies of the proceedings of the state 
educational association. At the general meetings addresses are made 
by the presidents of the various departments. Associate members 
become active after paying dues three years. 
Ohio compels permanent members, when dropped and reinstated, to 
pay dues in any year, together with all arrearage. 
Oklahoma is slowly awakening to the need of a stronger state asso- 
ciation, uniting the various educational elements of this progressive 
State. 
Oregon, on account of geographical conditions and transportation 
facilities, has two divisions of the:Oregon State Teachers’ Associa- 
tion—the eastern and the western. They are separate and inde- 
pendent organizations. Committees are now at work on plans for 
uniting the two associations. 
The Pennsylvania association permits its departments to hold 
regular and special meetings at such times and places as each may 
decide. Several of the departments meet at other times and at other 
places than the general meeting. This association has a permanent 
fund for educational research. 
 
-P-A-G-E-276
  
264 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
Rhode Island encourages, by committee, the study of marked edu- 
cational movements. It also has a committee to promote the study 
of Rhode Island history. 
The South Carolina educational societies, for the first time, met 
with the state association in a record-breaking meeting in the winter 
of 1908-9. Similar societies in other States are merely departments. 
Persons who desire to join the association certify in writing their 
intention to become permanent sustaining members. Members who 
desire to withdraw are required to notify the secretary before Jan- 
uary 1 of each year. 
South Dakota makes the state superintendent the legal agent of the 
association. Compensation of officers is determined by the executive 
committee. The convention designates who shall be members of each 
of the several departments, namely, county supervision, primary and 
kindergarten, elementary and rural, higher and secondary. If the 
departments grow too large, smaller divisions may be made. For 
the year 1902, and every six years thereafter, the association has the 
right to revise itseconstitution. It may amend it at any time. 
The Tennessee association, in its laws, in addition to the usual 
duties, gives the executive committee power to audit accounts, revise 
proceedings, prepare programmes, and nominate officers. Its meet- 
ing must be held during the vacation period not later than August 1. 
Texas, in spite of its size, enrolls at least a third of its teachers, and 
has enthusiastic meetings. Its purpose is cooperation among various 
factors. Texas has an executive board composed of one prominent 
teacher from each senatorial district that looks after educational 
legislation. 
Utah is alone, I think, in having a parents’ section. It also has arts 
and crafts, elocution, and physical culture sections. 
The Vermont association is for instruction, interest, and acquaint- 
anceship. The members of the board of directors are not allowed 
compensation for personal expenses for attendance at meetings of 
the board. The Vermont association places all ex-presidents residing 
in the State and engaged in educational work on the board of di- 
rectors. The annual meeting shall continue two or more days. 
Virginia strengthens the state organization by county and city 
organizations, auxiliary to the state organization. Each congres- 
sional district has a vice-president. Each vice-president is the stimu- 
lus for the district and reports to the president three times each year. 
In the state association there is one representative for every 25 mem- 
bers. Each member of the local association may vote unless there is 
a demand for roll call, when only representatives may vote. Local 
associations hold at least two meetings a year. The superintendent

of public instruction says in regard to the state association: “A con- 
siderable part of the progressive legislation enacted by the general 
assembly of 1908 was due to the effective work of the state teachers’ 
association, through its local organization.” 
The Washington Educational Association, in 1906, abolished its 
educational council by amendment. One member of the executive 
committee must be a resident of the place where the annual meeting 
is held. No expense is incurred by the executive committee without 
the approval of the president. 
West Virginia adopted a new constitution June 17, 1909, providing 
for five departments: City school administration, secondary education, 
elementary, normal, and county superintendence. The constitution 
provides for a June meeting, but the place of meeting is determined 
by the association. The executive committee must approve the pro- 
grammes of sectional meetings. 
Wisconsin arranges carefully details for the annual meeting. A 
bureau of information, a railway manager, a register, and guides help 
the unfamiliar. Entertainments, college alumni banquets, and re- 
ceptions are special features. The treasurer gives a bond of $2,000, 
the premium being paid by the association. Nonmembers pay 25 
cents admission to general sessions. 
The Wyoming association compels applicants who are elected mem- 
bers to sign the constitution. It has an amendment to its constitution 
stating that the president of the association shall not serve as a mem- 
ber of the executive committee. 
In order more ftilly to present conditions in state associations 
as they are to-day, I sent a syllabus to the various States, asking 
questions on topics that seem essential to a proper organization. 
These questions roughly divide themselves into questions of member- 
ship and organization and means for maintaining the same; the time 
and place of meeting; the programme; the aim and the influence of 
educational associations and personal opinions of leaders. From a 
great number and variety of replies I have endeavored to summarize 
such as appear to me to be helpful in the study of the problem which 
is before us. 
PERCENTAGE OF TEACHERS ENROLLED. 
In the year 1907 Rhode Island led in the percentage of teachers 
belonging to a state organization. The percentage in that State was 
81.4. Connecticut had 77.8; Utah, 67.6; Washington, 66.7; Cali- 
fornia, 60.7. Tennessee had the least enrollment. Pennsylvania, 
Georgia, Missouri, and Ohio, in an upward order, footed the list with 
Tennessee.

METHODS OF SECURING MEMBERS. 
The methods employed in the several States in securing members 
are varied. In a few, little or no effort is put forth; in others, com- 
mittees are constantly at work. On the whole, the answers to this 
inquiry are enigmatical. New Hampshire loyally responds: “ Little, 
if any, urging required.” In Idaho the expenses of the teachers are 
paid while attending such conventions. In Utah many school boards 
defray the expenses of the teachers. In Maryland solicitors canvass 
in each county. In Michigan the state department declares the meet- 
ing a state institute. In New Jersey a county chairman has charge 
and appoints any number of assistants.

   STATE EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS. 267 
Beyond these, the answers were more or less stereotyped. A few 
follow: “Notice by circular and bulletin;” through the news- 
papers;” “attractive programme;” “membership blanks sent to all 
teachers prior to the meeting ;” “secretary visits county institutes; ” 
“ouarantee live meetings;” “print proceedings;” “personal ap- 
peal;” “appeal to loyalty,” to which the writer facetiously adds, — 
“which often is not great;” “assign programme parts to teachers” 
in every part of the State; ” “work it up at county institutes; ” “city 
and county superintendents urge attendance.” It was not stated how 
the city and county superintendents were enthused. From the South 
comes this comment: “Girls in abundance; but men—rare.” Since 
girls fail to attract, all agree, I think, that the plan of Idaho and 
Utah commends itself as a surer means of securing a large enrollment. 
TIME OF MEETING. 
The proper time for holding the meeting is another mooted ques- 
tion. A canvass of 47 States and Territories disclosed the fact that 
2 associations hold their meetings in April, 1 in May, 9 in June or 
early in July, 5 in October, 7 in November, and 23 in December. In 
January, February, March, August, and September no meetings are 
held. As is readily seen from these figures the sentiment for a con- 
vention at the close of the school term is rapidly dissipating, and 
the preponderance of opinion is largely in favor of December, espe- 
cially the Christmas holidays, although Alabama reports that the 
thing that has helped its association to grow more than any other 
one thing was the change in the time of meeting from June to April. 
The constitution of the New Hampshire association requires that the 
annual meeting shall be held on the Friday and Saturday nearest 
the 20th of October. Many educators feel that the work of the 
convention is not entirely that of a summer-day picnic, and yet social 
features, such as the reunions in Michigan and the receptions at 
Atlantic City, N. J., and at other state meetings, are very helpful 
in acquainting members with one another. 
PLACE OF MEETING. 
   
        
                      The place of meeting often affects the success or nonsuccess of state 
educational meetings. The following States hold them in the same 
place each year: Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Towa, 
Kansas, Maine, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin. 
Massachusetts usually holds its meeting in Boston; Minnesota, in St. 
Paul; and Nebraska and Ohio, usually in the same place. South 
Dakota, in its constitution, directs that the annual meeting be held in 
cities of 5,000 or more population; North Dakota, alternately at 
Grand Forks and Fargo. Of the 16 usually following this custom    
-P-A-G-E-280
     
   
    
     
   
     
     
      
   
                    
          
          
           
    
          
      
    268 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
of holding the meetings in the same place, 12 state that it is a satis- 
factory plan, 2 think it unsatisfactory, and 2 are noncommittal. As 
a rule, the reason given for holding the meeting at one place is that 
hotel facilities demand it. Of the 29 States that hold meetings in 
different places each year, 22 feel that this is the proper method; 5 
think it is not; 2 are doubtful. It is evident that both plans meet 
with the approval of those who have them; consequently, the question 
of place of meeting does not enter very largely into the success of a 
meeting, if the hotel problem is eliminated, although it seems to me 
that meetings in different parts of a State arouse interest from time 
to time in the several sections of a State. Possibly no State is so 
fortunate in its permanent place of meeting as is New Jersey. Each . 
year this association gathers at its delightful sea resort, Atlantic 
City. 
TREND OF THE DISCUSSIONS. 
The programmes in the different associations vary. Industrial and 
vocational education is the most popular topic. In reply to the ques- 
tion, “ What do you emphasize in the programme?” the two general 
underlying themes in the replies are: The attitude of the teachers 
toward the profession, and the problems of instruction. Six States 
advocate the pedagogical side alone, and a very few the administrative. 
California, in one year, emphasized the spiritual element in educa- 
tion; in another year, sociological tendencies; Montana, industrial 
education; New Jersey, physical and industrial education; New York, 
everything new; Oregon, means of raising revenue; Texas, a certain 
theme each year; Virginia, progressive legislation; Washington, sec- 
tional meetings; West Virginia, school administration; Wyoming, 
state-wide interest in the schools; Pennsylvania, pressing problems 
in state education. Still others emphasize the inspirational side of 
teaching; finance; preparation of teaching; consolidation of schools; 
current educational problems; what conditions demand; what is of 
immediate importance; state problems. 
EMPLOYMENT OF OUTSIDE TALENT. 
   In regard to the use of outside talent on the programme, probably 
Connecticut, Rhode Island, California, Iowa, and Minnesota report 
the largest proportion of outside talent. Connecticut reports the best 
and largest meeting ever held was when only outside talent was em- 
ployed. Georgia, Oklahoma, and New Mexico report no outside 
talent. Other States use from 2 to 50 per cent. Florida reports that 
outside talent introduces and emphasizes new phases of education 
and arouses general enthusiasm. Kansas believes that outside talent 
pays; Kentucky, that local work is best, but that outside talent adds 
the “sauce; ” Virginia, that local talent stimulates local effort and
-P-A-G-E-281
  STATE EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS. 269 
reaches local conditions and that outside talent imparts inspiration 
and gives a basis for comparison. Practically the unanimous verdict 
is that both foreign and local people are desirable, each supplement- 
ing the other; that local men are best adapted to discuss local condi- 
tions, and outside men to impart breadth, interest, and inspiration. 
ATTITUDE OF COLLEGES AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS. 
As a rule, colleges cooperate with the state associations; private 
schools do not. The almost unanimous verdict is that colleges are 
helpful, but that private schools hold aloof. Of the States canvassed, 
2 report that private schools are active in association affairs, and 29 
that colleges are active. In 1 State, however, only 8 of 200 college 
instructors are enrolled. Oregon and several other States have a 
department in secondary education. In Illinois colleges have a sec- 
tion of their own. One State reports that the teachers in the colleges 
take more interest than the teachers in the common schools. In 
Louisiana private school teachers may only be honorary members. 
AIM OF THE SEVERAL ASSOCIATIONS. 
In order to probe the problem of state educational associations 
deeper, a few opinions in regard to the aim of the several associations 
as expressed by either state superintendents or officers of associa- 
tions, although more or less commonplace, are hopeful. For in- 
stance, Maryland reports its aim “to unite and cement our educa- 
tional forees;” Michigan, “to stimulate an appreciation of the 
responsibilities and opportunities of the profession ;” New York, “ to 
give trend to progressive movement; ” Washington, “ unity and har- 
mony in educational work;” Montana, “constructive education.” 
Others’ are thus phrased: “To create educational sentiment; ” “ ex- 
change ideas;” “inspiration;” “stimulation;” “widens teachers’ 
views;” “unity in school work;” “improve standards;” “ wider 
exchange of views; ” “ educational progress; ” “ elevate the character 
and advance the interest of teaching.” Illinois and South Dakota 
laconically state their objects to be “ the professional improvement of 
members and the advancement of school interests.” 
The New Mexico association in its prospectus urges teachers to 
attend the meetings of the association thus aptly: “It is the teacher’s 
professional duty; it adds to one’s resources; it clarifies one’s knowl- 
edge; it renews one’s enthusiasm; it increases one’s optimism; it 
dispels the blues; it helps to keep one out of the ruts. It may not 
remove gray hairs from the head, but it will help to keep gray hairs 
out of one’s methods.” 
It seems to me that the constitution of the New Jersey Educational 
Association covers the ground fully, thus: “To promote the educa-

tional interest of the State; to secure and maintain for the office of 
teaching its true rank among the professions; to promote and guard 
the interests of public and state school teachers by means of instruc- 
tion, conference, and united action.” 
INFLUENCE UPON LEGISLATION. 
As a legislative and political factor educational associations are not 
always potent. Possibly the New Jersey association is one of the 
most active in the line of influencing legislation for pupils, teachers, 
and schools. Much of the progressive school legislation on the statute 
books of this State has been due to its active state association. This 
association was called in extra session May 29, 1909, to protest and 
use its influence against the ruthless dismissal of teachers by boards 
of education on account of the thirty-five-year service law. Five 
hundred dollars was appropriated for expenses and counsel fees. 
New York, Virginia, Kentucky, California, Nevada, South Dakota, 
and Mississippi associations have also done much to help legislation. 
The influence in Pennsylvania has been more or less negative. Of the 
States canvassed, 28 reply that they influence state legislation more or 
less, 12 vote “no,” and 6 are silent. California replies, “ Voice very 
potent; ” Indiana, “ Very large factor; ” Mississippi, “ Very greatly; ” 
Nevada, “Initiates everything done;” New York, “Does not hesi- 
tate; South Dakota, “ All legislation has had its origin in the efforts 
of the association.” Kentucky reports, “No important legislation 
has been had except by its approval.” Other States, however, are 
not so optimistic. Maine participates in and influences legislation 
very little directly, and no specific acts have been passed through any 
direct influence of the association. Another association tries, but has 
little direct influence. Still another is unable to determine its influ- 
ence. Still another, “Can’t budge the gang.” Others meniorialize 
the legislature with little effect; and thus the story runs. It is evi- 
dent, however, that without state associations much less legislation 
would be on the statute books to-day. 
Specific acts passed through the influence of associations are numer- 
ous. Kentucky enthusiastically exclaims, “ Not room enough.” New 
York cordially reports, “Too numerous to mention in one line.” 
South Carolina reports that it helped the high-school act; South 
Dakota, compulsory-attendance certification of teachers by the State; 
Virginia, normal education; Washington, increase of 663 per cent in 
the state tax; West Virginia, revised school law; Wisconsin, compul- 
sory education; Alabama, redistricting act, uniform text-books, uni- 
form examination; California, increase in state and county school 
funds, state high-school law, compulsory-education law, act raising 
standard of certificates; Georgia, county institutes, graded course of 
study, summer schools; Illinois, creation of educational commission ;

In one State the result of one meeting was reported as four marriages

DESIRABLE AND UNDESIRABLE FEATURES. 
The persons interrogated were urged to give desirable and unde- 
sirable features in their respective associations. Washington and 
Kentucky write: “ Greatest single educational factor in the State;” 
Wisconsin, “ positively great, both to teachers and general public;” 
Alabama, “ leading force in educational advancement ;” Florida, “ the 
school interests of the State can not afford to be without it;” Illinois, 
“ absolutely necessary for progress ;” Mississippi, “ would lose much of 
inspirational spirit without it;” Nebraska, “no progressive State 
should be without it.” 
Other desirable features read thus: “ Brings teachers together,” 
“calls attention of people to educational forces,” “definite pro- 
gramme,” “ well-organized departments,” “publication of proceed- 
ings,” “study of vital educational problems,” “more teachers par- 
ticipating,” “ good programmes,” “ receptions,” “ time for social inter- 
course,” “ short speeches rather than papers,” “ unity,” “ cooperation,” 
“ cooperation of state department,” “ enthusiasm,” “ sympathy for each 
other,” “ best men on the programme,” “ live topics,” “ renewal of old 
acquaintanceship and making new friends,” “ wears away wrinkles,” 
“ opportunity to get a good wife,” and “ better than an operation for 
the ‘ set’ teacher.” 
Undesirable features read thus: “ Politics frequent,” “ schools that 
have hampered,” “ political ax grinding,” “ factional spirit and sec- 
tional feeling,” “ attempting to usurp the responsibilities of the legis- 
lature,” “overloaded formal programmes,” “long papers,” “ Chau- 
tauqua features,” “ meddling of school-book agents,” “ too many sub- 
jects,” “too great a variety of cliques,” “rivalry between institu- 
tions,” “ acrimonious debate,” “lengthy papers,” “ monopolistic col- 
lege element,” “lack of definiteness of purpose,” “too many side 
attractions,” “long-winded speeches of persons not in schoolroom,” 
“a dominant factor for selfish interests,” “dry papers,” “the know- 
all,” “the old fogy.” The answers invariably are “ indispensable,” 
“a good thing,” “ very great,” “helpful,” “ inestimable.”

  272 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
GENERAL OBSERVATIONS—OUTLOOK FOR THE FUTURE. 
The tenor of these fragmentary opinions, in my judgment, is ex- 
ceedingly encouraging. In spite of direful prophecy, the state asso- 
ciation survives and thrives; in spite of discontented murmuring it 
is a factor for progress; and in spite of the disgruntled carper, it will 
be the forum for the solution of the problems affecting the construct- 
ive reorganization of the public-school system in the States. The 
omens are entirely propitious. To be sure, many vexatious and dis- 
couraging problems confront it. The most distressing one, unques- 
tionably, is its seeming inability to unify its forces. With less than 10 
per cent of the half million teachers in this country regularly enlisted 
under its banner, little wonder that often its influence is imperceptible. 
With 40 per cent of the teachers only temporarily and occasionally 
enrolled, little wonder that its functions, as one critic puts it, are 
“ decidedly sporadic.” From every section of this land the report is: 
“The rank and file are indifferent; they see no immediate return; 
hence they are unwilling to build for the future, especially since that 
benefit may be for another.” ‘This selfish indifference is due chiefly 
to the fact that the average professional life of a teacher is four years. 
If one attends the meetings of two conventions five years apart, one 
is almost a total stranger. With the teaching force made up chiefly 
of men awaiting an opening to a more lucrative profession, and 
women awaiting an opportunity for the less distressing duties of 
wifehood, this problem of indifference is formidable. It will be met 
wholly only when teaching occupies its rightful place and men and 
women teach as they would practice law and medicine or preach the 
gospel. When once teachers feel the responsibility of their work as 
do men and women in other vocations, when their loyalty is no longer 
divided, and when the general public insists on discarding the in- 
competent and the favorite as a teacher, then the educational associa- 
tion will mean more to the teacher and to education. The solution, 
in my opinion, lies in placing teaching on such a plane that the 
indifferent and disloyal will soon fall by the wayside. 
It is asserted, too, that the state educational association often is 
dominated by selfish and ambitious persons, and that these persons 
use the organization to further their own aspirations and not to uplift 
the membership nor to forward the profession; that often the asso- 
ciation becomes the platform for persons who wish to exploit the- 
oretical devices rather than for those who desire to discover the fun- 
damental elements of pedagogy; that the advocates of delightful 
expedient are preferred to the expounders of rational principle. 
These are criticisms that are only too true, but they are not irreme- 
diable. Leaders of educational organizations must correct them if 
they would command, and look beyond self and beyond the oppor-
-P-A-G-E-285
    
STATE EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS. 273 
tunist. To be sure, with so very many who do not feel the least 
responsibility, an organization naturally drifts into the hands of the 
interested, the few who by choice or by compulsion survive in teach- 
ing. It behooves these few, however, to respect the rights of tem- 
porary teachers. It behooves them to recognize on their programmes 
those who have a message, and in the committees those who are will- 
ing to work. It behooves those who are ignored or timid to assert 
themselves, to make themselves felt. Of course, at present salaries, 
the large majority of teachers can not become prominent in any state 
organization. They are fortunate if they can attend several meet- 
ings in a lifetime. This, however, does not prevent them from giv- 
ing the association loyal support. With a loyal membership an asso- 
ciation soon becomes an influence that will uplift the teacher; will 
uplift teaching. Wherever teachers are alive to their honest inter- 
ests, there their conditions improve. “The most difficult legislators 
to convince,” said a prominent New Jersey educator to me recently, 
“are the members from the districts where the teachers are asleep 
professionally.” A prominent educator in my own State recently 
remarked: “TI will not urge my teachers to join the state association ; 
they need their dollars elsewhere.” In this same Pennsylvania we 
ask, “ Why do our teachers go to New Jersey?” They go because of 
improved conditions; I went there—for my life partner. I suggest 
that you go there for like reasons. 
This review discloses the fact that most of the associations are 
striving to be helpful factors in educational work. Each in its own 
way is doing much to improve school conditions. The pressing in- 
quiry now is, Would an organization of officers of state associations 
affiliated with the National Educational Association be helpful? In 
my opinion such a union would help to solidify the forces contending 
for the true and defeat the forces contending for the false. In union 
there is power. In the words of the revered Lincoln, if we would 
succeed, we must “ keep peggin’ away; keep peggin’ away.”

EDUCATION IN HAWAII. 
The following information relating to the schools and the school 
population in the Territory of Hawaii is taken from the report of the 
superintendent of public instruction to the governor of Hawaii for 
the biennial period 1907 and 1908. 
A comparative study of the enrollment in the public schools of the Territory 
for the last five years shows that there has been an increase in attendance of 
24 per cent, five nationalities representing over 90 per cent of the school enroll- 
ment as follows:

Of the increase during the last year, 68.33 per cent were Japanese; 13.12 
per cent Portuguese; 12.38 per cent Chinese. The above nationalities show 
an increase, with the exception of the pure Hawaiian, which is steadily decreas- 
ing from year to year. During this same five-year period the amounts expended 
for school purposes, aside from the loan fund, were:

  CHAPTER V. 
EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINES. 
The following extracts have been selected from the reports of the 
secretary and director of public instruction of the Philippines on 
account of the information they convey of the social conditions in the 
islands as affected by American customs and ideas, and especially by 
the introduction of the American school system. The documents 
relate to the year 1908. 
The attitude of the Filipinos toward the new education is shown 
in several acts of the Philippine assembly, a newly formed body, 
whose representatives are elected by the direct vote of the people. 
These acts are therefore significant of the real feeling of the people 
in the matter. The secretary writes as follows: 
The first act of the Philippine assembly and of the Philippine legislature, No. 
1801—known as the “Gabaldon Act”—appropriated the sum of 1,000,000 
($500,000) for the construction of public-school buildings in the barrios, or 
outlying hamlets, of the islands. One-fourth of this amount was made available 
on January 1, 1908, and one-fourth on the first day of each of the three next suc- 
ceeding calendar years. * * * 
The passage of this law by the newly formed Philippine assembly has proved 
of great moral support to the public-school system, and has done much to put 
at rest statements and arguments to the effect that public education was not 
really desired by the Filipino people. 
‘Throughout the entire session of the Philippine legislature the public-school 
system has received the warmest support from the assembly, both as a body 
and individually, and the effect of this attitude on the part of men of promi- 
nence and influence throughout the islands can not but make for the improve- 
ment of the schools and the spread of popular education in the English 
language. * * * 
SCHOOL DIVISIONS. 
Public educational work in the islands is now performed under the bureau of 
education, with a central office located in Manila, having 36 divisions, each in 
charge of a division superintendent, embracing in all 460 school districts, each 
in charge of a supervising teacher. The union of the provinces of Benguet and 
Bontoe in the ‘mountain (school) division,’ and of the province of Romblon 
with that of Capiz, reduces the number of school divisions to 36—not counting

SCHOOL-CONSTRUCTION WORK. 
Since the creation of the present bureau of education there have been con- 
structed in these islands a total of 2,696 schoolhouses of all kinds. In the year 
1903 the number constructed was 479; in 1904, 754; in 1905, 464; in 1906, 298; 
in 1907, 269; in 1908, 482. According to the best information obtainable there 
were 726 public schools in existence at the time of the American occupation of 
these islands. The school-construction work carried on during the years 1907 
and 1908 and that at present going on is of the most permanent and substantial 
character, with the exception of certain municipal primary schools, which are 
built by the municipalities, and are, in many instances, constructed of light ma- 
terials. During the last two years there were either built or purchased by the 
government 2 provincial high, 22 domestic science, 10 agricultural, 18 of arts 
and trades, 101 intermediate, and 548 primary schools, a total of 701. 
On June 30, 1908, the following school buildings were either contemplated or 
in ‘course of construction throughout the islands:

TEACHING FORCE. 
The teaching force maintained directly by the insular government is approx- 
imately 1,572, of whom 877 are American and 695 Filipino insular teachers. 
This is an increase of 51 American and 240 Filipino insular teachers over the 
force so provided on June 30, 1907. * * * 
During the past school year 266 additional primary, 2 secondary, 31 inter- 
mediate, 3 arts and trades, 7 agricultural, and 13 domestic-science schools were 
opened.

The foregoing statement does not, of course, include the Moro Province. By 
“pupils belonging ” is meant the pupils who remain on the rolls throughout the 
year, as distinguished from those whose attendance continues only during a 
portion thereof. 
The percentage of attendance was generally good, the highest being in the 
city of Manila, 96 per cent, or a gain of 2 per cent over last year. 
The lowest percentages of attendance, 70 and 71, were found in the provinces 
of Misamis and Albay, respectively. 
In the primary, or municipal, schools the average total enrollment by months 
during the last school year was 323,327, as against 332,634 for the preceding 
year, or a decrease of 9,307. 
As was stated in the last report of this department— 
“Further enrollment under present conditions is practically out of the ques- 
tion, owing to the fact that the municipalities throughout the islands have not 
sufficient funds to employ a larger number of teachers or to construct addi- 
tional primary schools in the towns and barrios; and inasmuch as the present 
force of municipal or primary teachers has as large a number of pupils as it 
can successfully manage, further increase in enrollment in primary work must

The current appropriation bill for the bureau of education provides for the 
maintenance in the United States of 130 Filipino students. Up to the present 
time some 60 students have returned to these islands upon the expiration of 
their terms of appointment, and all have received government appointments, 
as follows:

PHILIPPINE MEDICAL SCHOOL, 
Substantial progress in the organization, equipment, and operation of the 
Philippine Medical School has been made during the past year. 
The teaching staff has been augmented by the appointment of associate and 
assistant professors, and by a lecturer in medical entomology. In February 
last the board of control authorized the appointment, for the school year 
1908-9, of demonstrators in anatomy and histology, bacteriology and pathology, 
medical zoology, chemistry, and physiology, and first-class student assistants in 
anatomy, histology, bacteriology, pathology, medical zoology, clinical micro- 
scopy, and chemistry. The appointment of second-class student assistants in 
anatomy, histology, and clinical microscopy was also authorized. These 
positions are filled from the student body, the appointees being selected upon 
merit, and serving under the personal supervision and instruction of their 
respective professors. The demonstrators receive #480 per annum, first-class 
student assistants #240 per annum, and students of the second class ®120 per 
annum. The compensation is necessarily small, but it is believed that the 
students thus selected will prove to be of decided value to the school. 
The membership statistics of the school are as follows:

There were 2 government scholarship students and 1 woman student in the 
first-year class of 1907-8. The school year 1908-9, which opened on June 8, 1908, 
has no government scholarship students. Of the first-year class 2 are women. 
The report of the director of education, Dr. David P. Barrows, 
contains important observations upon the social conditions in the 
islands after ten years of American occupation, which will be of 
interest hereafter to students of history, and numerous quotations 
are accordingly taken from that document. 
Speaking of special conditions affecting schools, Doctor Barrows 
remarks that the economic distress of the country in recent years 
has placed great obstacles in the way of school organization. He 
specifies the fall in price of abaca and the failure of the rice crop, 
to which might be added the rinderpest. The unsettled condition 
of the population in many districts is another obstacle. There is a 
constant emigration from one place to another. One division super- 
intendent reports that one “ great difficulty that we have in reaching 
the whole population is the movement of the people to the country 
and the founding of numerous new barrios of 10 and 20 families. 
Under the Spanish Government the people were compelled to live 
in towns and were told where to build their towns, but now the 
towns are practically disappearing. There is not a town in the 
province that has not decreased in population since the American
-P-A-G-E-295
    EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINES. 283 
occupation; some have lost 50 per cent of their people.” Doctor 
Barrows goes on to say: 
Social conditions are changing as well. In previous reports the director of 
education has discussed the social order in the Philippines, the relations of 
the small well-to-do and educated class of people, the “ gente ilustrada,” and 
the great mass of poor and ignorant, the “gente baja.” A change in the direc- 
tion of a more democratic social order is taking place. It is hard to discuss 
a matter of this kind except in general terms; figures are practically unob- 
tainable, but it appears quite certain that a middle class is growing up and 
that the opportunities of this middle class have been greatly enlarged since 
the American occupation. This class includes shopkeepers, traders, small 
buyers, and merchants of every description, as well as such semiprofessional 
classes as teachers, clerks, employees of the new transportation systems, etc. 
Such men have much greater opportunities for gaining enlightenment and a 
steady competence than the rural toiler, especially if the latter is simply a 
tenant, owns nothing except his plow and nipa house, and passes his life in 
the condition of a bonded debtor to the landowner. I can not yet say whether 
or not the class of small farmers, or “‘ peasant proprietors,” is gaining in num- 
bers, well-being, and independence. This class is numerous throughout the 
Tlocano territory and in some other parts of the islands, but in other provinces 
the rice is grown only on great estates, the cocoanut groves are owned solely 
by landed proprietors and cared for by tenants, while almost the entire sugar 
crop is raised on large haciendas by tenantry, who have no property and whose 
economic condition is most unpromising. The hope of the common people lies 
either in possessing small farms or engaging successfully in lines of trade 
which will contribute generally to the commercial development of the islands. 
These small farmers and these traders, both of them with enough education 
to keep their own accounts and manage their own affairs, independent of 
“cacique” or middlemen, are two classes which we hope to produce in great 
numbers through the work of the primary schools. 
The political campaign of last year preceding the elections to the Assembly 
and of provincial and municipal officials had, in general, unfortunate effects 
upon the school work and school attendance. In many provinces it engrossed 
the attention of officials whose assistance in the conduct of school work during 
the first months of the school year was thus lost. In a number of provinces 
the canvass made by candidates representing hopes of early independence 
led the people to believe that the American Government in the islands would 
soon cease, English be no longer spoken, and that there was nothing to be 
gained by sending their children to the public schools. * * * 
The success of the schools depends in a marked degree upon the attitude 
of the public, and especially the official class. Their successful conduct so far 
and their wide organization have been possible because the people have been 
exceeding desirous of having them. The period of revolution and insurrection, 
disastrous as it was in many respects, was nevertheless a period of great social 
awakening; even the lowest classes were so stirred that the desire for instruc- 
tion became general. There has been no compulsory-attendance law in the 
Philippines, and although municipalities, acting under the belief that they 
had a power conferred upon them in Spanish times, have sometimes compelled 
attendance by means of local ordinances, in general the schools have succeeded 
because of popular support. Local opinion needs to be constantly studied, in- 
terested, and informed. Division superintendents were directed this year to 
report with care upon this matter, which they have done. Most provinces 
 
-P-A-G-E-296
284 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
report the attitude of officials and people as favorable, helpful, and expressive 
of confidence in school work. There are, however, exceptions. In at least 
two provinces public feeling is apathetic, while frequently in a single or cer- 
tain towns of a province there is an indifference or even a covert opposition. 
The causes of this apathy or opposition are several, and may be summarized 
as follows: In certain parts great ignorance and inertness characterize the 
population; there is no progress in any direction; the entire municipal life 
of the towns is neglected and inefficient, and in these places school work suffers 
with everything else. In certain other towns, and with certain individuals, 
there is an expression of disappointment with the work accomplished by the 
primary school. This disappointment rests largely upon the fact that the 
education of children seems to parents disappointingly slow. Under the system 
of dialect and catechism schools the child is able to acquire what are regarded 
as the essential rudiments in the space of about a year. In this time he learns 
the alphabet, the syllabary, and the catechism. This has been the primary 
education of many generations, and the feeling that a year or parts of two 
successive years is the right amount of time for a child to continue in school 
is deeply embedded in the minds of parents, who want the children at home 
to perform household duties and to assist in the care of animals. The public 
school system contemplates no decisive result short of the completion of three 
or four years of continuous instruction. The majority of children in attend- 
ance upon the primary schools leave at the end of one, two, or two and a half 
years without having obtained the rudiments of education proposed.    
The director then speaks of the desire for dialect instruction, which, 
he says, has manifested itself chiefly in the Tagalog provinces around 
Manila. Its leading exponents are several Filipino papers in Manila. 
It is a cause of dissatisfaction with the public schools, though not 
widely spread, that the dialects are ignored in them, while English 
is taught. He continues: 
However, taking all things together, it may be said that the attitude of the 
official class is really more friendly and certainly more helpful than at any 
previous time; that the attitude of the people is less enthusiastic, but with 
certain local exceptions hardly less really interested than formerly. The people 
have, however, become more critical, are disposed to view the work of the 
schools more intelligently, and to demand substantial results. Furthermore, 
the presence of American Government in these islands has given a tremendous 
impetus not merely to public education but to private instruction as well. The 
towns and villages abound with private schools and “colegios,” varying in 
nearly every degree of size and pretentiousness. As a part of the general 
awakening of the people and as an expression of their eagerness for wider life 
and opportunity, these schools are a favorable sign. On the other hand, in 
too many cases they are not what they pretend to be, and may be even a posi- 
tive detriment to the children that attend. Too frequently they are conducted 
simply as a means of livelihood for some man or woman who is a failure in 
ordinary lines of industry. These “ dame schools” and more ambitious insti- 
tutions draw many pupils from the public schools. 
Nevertheless, I believe that the population of the islands view the public 
schools with satisfaction and confidence, and that this is sufficiently expressed. 
in their readiness to sustain them by taxation, by the constant growth in the 
number of these schools, and by the increasing permanency of attendance. 
It is unfortunate that the attitude of much of the American community and 
of the American press is outspokenly hostile to public instruction. The cry is 
   
-P-A-G-E-297
  
EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINES. 285 
the common one, that the public schools interfere with the availability of labor, 
train boys away from the fields, and expend large sums of money which would 
better be devoted to industrial and commercial development. The Manila Times 
in recent months has engaged in a vigorous campaign with the professed object 
of debating down the insular appropriations for education. It was also repre- 
sented that the present educational policy neglects the practical training for 
life or industrial efficiency; that the money devoted to public instruction is in 
Jarge part wasted; and that a radical change in the amount and character of 
instruction should be made. I shall have to leave readers of this report to judge 
for themselves as to the truth or falsity of these criticisms. The proposition 
can not be maintained that the bureau of education has not had constantly be- 
fore its view large social and industrial aims. It is sufficient to invite atten- 
tion to previous reports of the director of education, where these subjects have 
repeatedly been considered.¢ 
So far as opposition to Philippine education is a reflection of that ungenerous 
and illiberal opposition to native enlightenment which too often takes possession 
of Americans domiciled in these islands, I believe it to be recreant to every 
principle of our national policy and to a due regard for justice. “ Justice,” in 
the language of Plato and Ulpian, “is the constant and perpetual purpose of 
rendering to everyone his own,” and the attempt to deprive an aspiring and 
awakened people of general elementary schooling, to keep them ignorant and 
dependent, for the benefit of commercial interests, or to deny them liberty in 
the choice of their studies and professions, is palpably an attempt to exclude 
them from that which is rightfully theirs. * * * 
PROGRESS MADE IN PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. 
The bureau of education was organized in January, 1901; division superin- 
tendents were appointed and the work in most parts of the islands commenced 
during the succeeding year. Reliable school data hardly exists, however, before 
1903, and our review of advance made will be confined to the intervening years. 
In 1903 it was estimated that there were in existence about 2,000 public schools; 
there were estimated to be about 3,000 Filipino teachers, and a school attend- 
ance of about 150,000. In 1904 the number of primary schools had increased to 
2,233; the number of Filipino teachers to 3,584; and the school attendance for 
the month of March was 227,600. In March, 1905, the primary schools had in- 
creased to 2,727; the number of Filipino teachers had risen to 4,036; and the 
number of pupils in primary schools in the month of March, 1905, was 311,843. 
In 1906 the number of primary schools had increased to 3,166; the number of 
Filipino teachers to 4,719; and the school attendance for the month of March 
was 375,554. In 1907 the number of primary schools had increased to 3,485; 
the number of Filipino teachers-to 6,141; and the enrollment for the month of 
March was 835,106, The year just closed has seen the conduct of 3,701 primary 
schools, with 6,620 Filipino teachers, and an enrollment for the month of March 
of 359,738, or 24,632 more than in March of a year ago. This is the bare record 
of a constant advance in the number of primary schools established and con- 
ducted, of the steady development of a corps of Filipino teachers more than 
twice as numerous as five years ago. As for attendance of children in school,

cation for 1905; see also an address before the American Academy of Political and Social 
Science at Philadelphia, April, 1907, ‘‘ Education and social progress in the Philippines,”

if this is made the basis of our judgment, it rose very rapidly until the end of 
the year 1906, fell off somewhat for 1907, and rose again during the last year. 
While this falling off of attendance during the last two years is not a favor- 
able sign, and is due in some cases to poor conditions and lack of school rev- 
enue; in others, to an unfavorable attitude of the people; it may be said that 
while the numbers are still somewhat less than they were two years ago, the 
number of children to a teacher is nearly 60, and the character of instruction 
has improved by the reduction of numbers. The pupils themselves are consid- 
erably further advanced and distributed in larger proportions in higher grades 
than they were two years ago. * * * 
The primary course covers only four grades, but it provides nearly as much 
schooling as is obtained by the average person in the United States. In addi- 
tion the four years’ training in reading, language, and writing, three years of 
arithmetic and a geography primer, the primary course has been changed within 
the last two years in order to increase the amount of time given to training in 
handicrafts. Under the plan of industrial training, outlined in 1904, the 
primary schools have concerned themselves with arts and industries native to 
the population of the archipelago. The native arts are full of interest for the 
educator, the ethnologist, the economist, or the lover of beautiful things. They 
vary much from province to province and are frequently narrowly localized. 
The objects sought are to preserve, diffuse, and perhaps perfect the practice _ 
of such of these manufactures as particularly commend themselves for their 
utility or beauty. These handicrafts are, and should remain, household in- 
dustries in which all members of the family can participate during the spare 
hours of the day when ordinary occupation can not be followed. Every agri- 
cultural family is possessed of considerable intervals between the seasons of 
planting and harvest, when there is abundant leisure, and this leisure can well 
be employed in the braiding of hats, the making of mats and bags, or the weay- 
ing of fabrics. It is very noticeable that communities now possessing these 
arts are conspicuous for their industry and well-being. Instruction in one or 
more of these native manufactures is given in nearly all primary schools during 
the first three grades of the course. The standard of attainment set may be 
judged from the following regulation: Industrial work designed to increase the 
efficiency of pupils and prepare them for better making a living or a home 
will be emphasized in this grade. This industrial work may vary according to 
the locality, but should in all cases be carefully prescribed by the division 
superintendent and report made to the director of education thereon. It is 
recommended that boys be taught to construct useful, even though rude, furni- 
ture and be practiced in the repair of fences, bridges, houses, and other build- 
ings. For the girls, in addition to sewing and elementary domestic art, instruc- 
tion should be given in domestic science, including housekeeping and cooking, 
home nursing, and sanitation. Training in weaving cotton and other fabrics 
on the upright loom is especially recommended for the girls of this grade. 
The fourth year of the primary school is taking on a somewhat distinct char- 
acter. All of the instruction given aims to prepare the young men and women 
for useful life in the rural towns in which they reside. The language and 
arithmetic work are based upon the industrial activities in which the pupils 
are engaged, or in which they will be employed after leaving school. A series 
of industrial leaflets takes up successively the ordinary activities of Filipino 
communities. In arithmetic the work has to do with buying and selling, with 
loans, commissions, with postal savings-bank accounts, homesteading land, 
keeping simple books, and a variety of other useful and practical matters which 
can be better judged by an examination of the primary arithmetic made for use 
in this grade. Simple physical geography or elementary physics will be taught    
 
-P-A-G-E-299
  EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINES. 287 
and a variety of natural phenomena closely allied to everyday life will be 
studied and explained, as well as ordinary mechanical devices and discoveries. 
The plan also contemplates a semester’s instruction in hygiene and sanitation 
and of work by the boys in agriculture and special tool work, for keeping things 
in repair; and by the girls in housekeeping, sewing, and loom weaving. A 
special type of elementary industrial school is planned. These schools will 
teach only the one year—Grade IV. They will take boys and girls from the 
barrio schools of the town where they have had three elementary years of 
instruction, and by one year of special instruction help to make good farmers, 
tradesmen, or housewives in Filipino rural communities. Before such work 
can be widely prosecuted there must be a special building provided with suit- 
able grounds and land, and there must be specially trained Filipino teachers, 
Current school revenues can not be spared to construct such school plants, but 
it is believed that this type of school will be entitled to receive benefit from 
the hoped-for congressional legislation setting aside for industrial schools the 
receipts from the sales of the public domain. Something is already being done 
to train the teachers. For the last two years training classes for just this 
work have been conducted in connection with the provincial high school of 
Pangasinan. Such teachers’ courses are now about to be given in the Philip- 
pine Normal School and the Philippine School of Arts and Trades, and teachers 
appointed under scholarships for a year of study will in many cases take these

THE INTERMEDIATE SCHOOLS. 
The intermediate schools were devised to fill the interval in the child’s train- 
ing between the brief course of the primary school and the secondary courses 
of the high school. Their character and studies were first outlined in a bul- 
letin on courses of instruction of June 15, 1904, and their nature and work 
were discussed in the report of the general superintendent of education for 
1904, pages 25-34. As a bridge between the primary and secondary schools 
these institutions continue the academic instruction in the ordinary branches. 
They were designed, however, to have a distinctive character of their own. 
Elementary science studies are emphasized—the first year, plant life; the sec- 
ond year, animal life; and the third year, human physiology. Agriculture and 
tool work for boys and housekeeping and domestic arts for girls are pre- 
scribed subjects of every fully organized intermediate course. In a country 
like the Philippine Islands industrial training can not be deferred until the 
high school, as it usually is in America; it must be carried down into interme- 
diate grades if it is really to affect the standard of life and the industrial 
efficiency of any considerable part of the population. While in the United States 
trade schools and manual training schools have been generally high schools, here 
such instruction is intermediate. The secondary student receives much too 
advanced an education to ever follow a trade. Inducements in other lines of 
activity are too attractive, and if this teaching is to affect the class of skilled 
labor it must be given at least as early as in the intermediate course. 
The first intermediate schools established were the reorganized high schools, 
which had been opened two years previously without a definite course of studies 
or entrance requirement. As these high schools have developed into secondary 
institutions, the intermediate school has continued as the preparatory depart- 
ment, although in several institutions—Manila, Iloilo and Malolos, Bulacan— 
the process of cutting out the intermediate school has begun. 
In addition to these the plan has been to establish a considerable number of 
intermediate schools in other towns, especially in large towns so situated that  
-P-A-G-E-300
  288 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
children from adjacent municipalities may attend. ‘The limited resources avail- 
able for public instruction have prevented the establishment of these schools 
in all the places where the demand for them exists, and at the present time it 
is impossible to afford this teaching to an increasingly large number of children 
who are prepared for it and desirous of receiving it. As it is, division superin- 
tendents have organized these schools more rapidly than we have had build- 
ings, equipment, and teachers to properly conduct them. During the last year, 
in addition to the preparatory departments of 88 high schools, intermediate 
instruction was given in 160 schools. Of this number 36 had the three grades, 
V, VI, and VII; 64 two grades; and 60 but one grade. * * * 
Each intermediate school is designed to have a shop, a school garden or farm, 
and a domestic-science building or a model native cottage. It is difficult to get 
well-trained and satisfactory teachers of these subjects, and the housing and 
equipment are somewhat expensive. Five years ago practically nothing of this 
kind was possessed nor was such instruction being given, but at the present time 
the intermediate department of every provincial high school, with three excep- 
tions, has a well-equipped shop. Ninety-one teachers, including the instructors 
in the trade schools at Manila, Iloilo, and Bacolor, are engaged in giving shop 
instruction. In all of these schools there is an adequate supply of bench tools 
and equipment. In addition to tool work there is a graded course in drawing, 
including the elements of geometrical and elementary mechanical drawing. The 
three trade schools above mentioned teach a number of trades. In 11 of these 
schools there is woodworking machinery, consisting of engine, circular and band 
saws, planer, and lathes. Eleven more outfits of machinery were ordered last 
spring and will be installed during this school year. Ten of these schools have 
now excellent shop buildings and 13 more such buildings are under construction, 
with 7 more projected, funds and land being in part available. 
Instruction in domestic science, which was not organized until about three 
years ago, has made hardly less satisfactory progress. Forty-one women 
teachers are at present engaged in giving this instruction to intermediate classes. 
A few of these have had special university training to fit them to be teachers of 
domestic science; the rest are women selected because of their skill in house- 
wifery, their practical effectiveness, and their interest in the social side of 
Filipino life. Such instruction is now given in all but 5 high schools. In most 
instances special buildings have been provided, in two cases a model Filipino 
house has been built and a third one is in process of erection. The bureau of 
education supplies the outfit—stove, cooking utensils, and table service. Few 
features of our work have attracted more attention or have been so heartily 
welcomed as this instruction in housekeeping and household arts. Filipino girls 
are yery ambitious to be good housewives and anxious that their homes shall 
accord with cultivated standard. 
In agriculture less has been done. Here the difficulty is threefold—the ob- 
taining of suitable farms and lands, the lack of experienced agricultural teach- 
ers, the undeveloped condition of scientific agriculture in the Philippines. Good 
farming lands adjacent to the sites for high or intermediate schools are very 
difficult to obtain. It seems desirable that such lands should also be susceptible 
of irrigation and of a character to admit of diversified agriculture. Many sites 
have been offered that are unsuitable. In a good many cases long delay is 
- resulting from the difficulty in securing titles. We have suitable agricultural 
Jand at present only in 26 schools where the intermediate course is taught. 
There are 12 instructors in agriculture, most of them trained in agricultural 
schools in the United States, who are devoting all of their tims this year to 
agricultural teaching and experiment. * * *

EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINES. 289 
WHAT THE INTERMEDIATE GRADUATES ARE DOING. 
A very important inquiry, and one which may well test the value of the 
instruction given in the intermediate school is, “ What do the graduates do; do 
they apply themselves earnestly and successfully to useful lines of work, or do 
they fall into a life of useless ease or dangerous discontent as their critics 
prophesy?” An effort has been made to keep track of all of these graduates 
and record their careers. 
Since March, 1905, about 3,000 young men and women have graduated from 
intermediate schools, 1,350 of them last March. Records as to what they have 
done are not complete, but what we do know of them is of interest and signifi- 
cance. Much the largest number have continued as students in secondary 
courses, over 1,800 are at present so engaged; 26 have been appointed to posi- 
tions as government students in the United States; 16 have gone to the United 
States to study on their private means; a very large number (our records are 
incomplete, but nearly 500 are reported) are teaching in municipal schools. 
Seventeen are reported as farmers, 11 as merchants, 8 as municipal officials, and 
89 as clerks. 
Very few are reported as being idle or failures. * * * 
THE SECONDARY COURSES, 
These courses were outlined in Bulletin No. 7, June 15, 1904, and more fully 
in Bulletin No. 26, 1906. Four courses are at present provided. These are the 
course in literature, science, and history; the course in teaching; the course in 
commerce; and the course in agriculture. The literary and teachers’ training 
courses are offered in nearly every high school; agriculture at present only as 
a course in the Philippine Normal School; commerce in only one school, the 
Philippine School of Commerce in Manila. The original plan of the high schools 
was to make them vocational training schools, and this plan is to some degree 
being realized. The number of students enrolled in secondary courses is still 
small. For the present school year (1908-9) there are reported in the first 
year 956, in the second year 590, in the third 232, and in the fourth 124. There 
have been so far 13 secondary graduates; from the Manila Normal School, 3 
in 1907 and 1 in March, 1908; from the Cavite High School, 5 in March, 1908; 
and from the Iloilo High School, 4 in March, 1908. 
As above stated, a high school is located in each provincial capital; their 
work is satisfactory, and in the majority of cases suitable buildings and grounds 
have been secured. The plan is for an extensive campus and a group of build- 
ings, embracing central recitation building, science hall, shop buildings for in- 
termediate department, dormitories, and agricultural farm. Judging from the 
number at present enrolled in the fourth year of secondary courses, 124, there 
will be fully 100 graduates next year. It is believed that most of.these will 
wish to pursue professional courses, especially medicine, agriculture, and 
engineering. The University of the Philippines, recently provided for by Act 
No. 1870, is expected to make provision for this professional and collegiate 
instruction. 
SCHOOL ATHLETICS. 
Athletic sports are pursued with great interest in every division. Nearly 
every high school has a ball team or teams. Twice the schools have been 
recipients of gifts from Hon. W. Cameron Forbes—baseball outfits and 
tennis outfits to the school in each province making the greatest progress 
9228—rp 1909—vor 1. 19   
 
-P-A-G-E-302
  
  290 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
in beautifying and improving its grounds. With these sets as models the pupils 
have themselves manufactured a good deal of their athletic equipment; and the 
bats are easily turned out in the shops. Military drill is given in at least five 
provinces. In addition to tennis, the girls in several provinces are playing 
basket ball. Several provinces have annual field days. In southern Luzon, 
the Bicol provinces of Camarines, Albay, Sorsogon, and the subprovince of 
Masbate, hold each year a field meet which has grown into the proportions of a 
provincial exposition. A number of beautiful trophies have been given for the 
competitors in this meet. These are as follows: The Trent trophy, for baseball; 
the Carson trophy, for excellence in English composition ; the Bicol declamation 
trophy; and a trophy for track athletics given by the American Hardware 
Company. This last year the meet was held at Nueva Caceres. In addition 
to the scholastic contest and the athletic meet, an agricultural and industrial 
exposition was held, in which were displayed modern agricultural machinery, 
a large quantity of which is reported to have been purchased by the farmers 
of the province, and an extensive exhibit of the industrial work of the schools, 
and the products and manufactures of the province. The occasion was much 
more than a school gathering; it was attended, participated in, and aided by 
officials and citizens of every class. 
A baseball league exists among the teams of the cities of Manila and 
Cavite. Several trophies have been played for by this league—the Osorio prize 
cup, a set of cups given by Professor Woods, of Groton School, Massachusetts, 
and finally a beautiful trophy to be played for for seven successive years, given 
by the boys of the Groten School, Massachusetts. 
Medical inspection of children would be desirable in all of the schools of the 
islands. So far, it has been attempted only in the city of Manila. During the 
last year a qualified physician—Dr. Anna D. Peck—was employed by the 
bureau of education and devoted all of her time to this examination. Many 
cases were recommended by her for treatment at the various hospitals, where 
it was given gratuitously. Among other cases were nearly 200 of beriberi. 
“Anemia was very prominent during the first examinations, but after the 
establishment of kitchens in the various schools there was an astonishingly 
large decrease. The general physical condition of the pupils was so greatly 
improved that great credit should accrue to the supervising teachers and others 
who began the work.” Glasses were generously furnished free of charge to a 
large number of indigent pupils by a Manila optician. A total of 7,319 pupils, 
5,459 boys and 1,860 girls, were examined. Defective vision was very prevalent, 
myopia in 82 per cent of the cases, astigmatism in 47 per cent, and diseased’ 
lids (largely trachoma) in 17 per cent; defective hearing existed in 7 per 
cent; dentist caries in 42 per cent; excessive adenoid tissue (tonsils, pharynx, 
and nostrils) in 21 per cent; anemia in 10 per cent; 20 per cent were affected 
with skin disease, and an equal number were pitted from the effects of small- 
pox. Bodily deformities were rare. The large amount of defective vision, bad 
teeth, and adenoids recommends the necessity of some provision for giving treat- 
ment and remedying these defects. This report takes no account of intestinal 
parasites or such chronic disorders, or of tubercular conditions, 
THE SCHOOLS AND THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE, 
All instruction in the public schools covered by this report is given in the Eng- 
lish language. From the organization of the schools methods of translation have 
been avoided, and a knowledge ‘of the language is acquired by its constant use 
and repetition. The child who enters school entirely ignorant of English will 
understand ordinary directions of the schoolroom within a very few days;
-P-A-G-E-303
  
  EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINES. 291 
after that he picks up the language rapidly, and by use of the chart and primer 
he learns to read, to write, and to speak it at the same time. A child, under 
favorable conditions of instruction, may learn in the course of the school year 
to read and write about 250 words, with a conversational acquaintance of nearly 
as many more. This is considered a good foundation, but it is obviously of 
small value to the child if he is to stop here. It is observable, however, that 
second-grade pupils use their English pretty well, are able to carry on a con- 
yversation upon limited topics with a stranger, tell him about their town, and 
give him directions. By the time a child has completed the third grade he has 
secured a knowledge of the language which will remain with him, and which 
he will constantly amplify after he leaves school. It is common to meet young 
men and women engaged in small commercial pursuits who speak very good 
English and are able to, use it for reading and writing, but who no more than 
completed the third year of some primary school. The aim in the primary 
course is to give the boy and girl enough English so that they can read an ordi- 
nary book or newspaper and gain a reading and writing habit. I think this can 
be accomplished by the primary course, although results have not yet been fully 
demonstrated. e 
The primary school can not, of course, make a finished literary scholar; but 
if it can give a child a training in letters to the point where he can read and 
write upon ordinary matters, and profit by the newspapers, keep his accounts, 
and conduct his own commercial transactions, and be able to appreciate and 
assimilate to some extent the news of the world, he will be a truly literate man 
and will not go through the world a mere clod. Children who are only gradu- 
ates of a primary school will not speak or write wholly correct and grammatical 
English, but those who make their deficiencies the ground for depreciating 
their attainments and the work of the schools should recall the undeniable fact 
that the ordinary American citizen—farmer or mechanic—can not write a letter 
free from errors of punctuation, capitalization, grammar, and misspelling; yet 
who is prepared to deny that his schooling is of the utmost importance to 
him, not only in the exercise of his duties as a citizen, but for the intellectual 
life which it affords him and for the conduct of his practical affairs? Or, to 
use another illustration, the English spoken by Filipino boys and girls just out 
of school is unquestionably better, superior in grammar, vocabulary, and accent 
to the Spanish that the majority of Americans in these islands are able to 
speak and write. But poor as American-spoken Spanish is, the immense ad- 
vantage that it gives to a foreigner in this country is undeniable. The same 
is true of Filipino-spoken English. The object of the schools, it is granted, must 
be to impart correct and not corrupt English, to teach the youth to speak it 
and write it colloqvially and freely, and this ideal must never be lost sight of; 
but meanwhile the tremendous practical advantage of every increased means 
of communication between the native and foreign elements is too frequently 
unrealized. Communication of ideas and not of polished phrases is, after all, 
the object, and when the means of this communication between all peoples in 
these islands has been fairly well established through the medium of the 
English tongue, then in great part the present.strife and variance will cease and 
we may look for that better understanding, that increase of mutual considera- 
tion and respect, which is so greatly to be desired. 
It is impossible to accurately estimate at the present time the number of 
Filipino people who have a knowledge of English. There are many thousands 
of children and young people who speak it to the degree above discussed, and 
these young people are found in every town and in every considerable barrio, 
so that a stranger encering almost any Filipino community now rarely has diffi- 
culty in tinding some small person to act as interpreter and adviser. There is  
-P-A-G-E-304
  292 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
also a large class of young men and young women who speak English surpris- 
ingly well, and this includes nearly all of those occupying official or important 
commercial positions. Of the adult population, including persons of mature 
years and social influence, the number speaking English is relatively small. 
This class speaks Spanish, and as it is the most prominent and important class 
of people in the islands, Spanish continues to be the most important language 
spoken in political, journalistic, and commercial circles. The class of young 
people who have been educated in English in the public schools is only begin- 
ning to make its way into the active life of the country. Another ten years will 
tell very greatly in the relative importance of the two languages. Meanwhile, 
the question is disturbing many minds, “ What is to be the ultimate language of 
this people as they attain a common consciousness and solidarity?” This 
question has been much discussed within the last two or three years. At the 
time of the American occupation there was a general feeling among Filipinos 
that the knowledge of the Spanish language had been deliberately and wrongly 
withheld from them by the sovereign country. English, as the language of the 
new sovereign nation, was asked for in part as a political concession. When it 
“was proposed to bring American teachers to the islands to impart this instruc- 
tion, the number proposed by the general superintendent was 500, but this was 
raised to 1,000 at the earnest solicitation of Filipinos in order that there might 
be an American teacher for every important pueblo of the archipelago. Thus, 
at the very outset of educational work, English was decided upon as the 
language of instruction as a matter of joint agreement, and if there is dissent 
now in some quarters from making English the language of instruction there 
was not then. The spread of the English language has gone steadily on. The 
results are undoubtedly cumulative. It was more taught and more spoken last 
year than the year before, and this coming year will see a greater extension of 
it than last year saw, yet it still has active rivals as the language of use and 
instruction. It is probable also that there has been some decline of interest on 
the part of the adult population in the English language. This is attributable 
to several causes. In the first year of the organization of this bureau the adult 
population of the towns eagerly sought opportunities to learn English. Night 
schools were opened in the city of Manila in 1900; later in nearly all the towns 
of the archipelago. In August, 1904, there were 501 such classes, with an en- 
rollment of over 1,800 people, most of them adult men and women. Owing, 
however, to the reduction of the appropriation for the bureau of education, it 
was necessary a few months later, in order to avoid the incurring of a deficit, 
to close all the night schools in the provincial towns. This was in January, 
1905. It was anticipated at the time that it would be possible to reopen them 
the ensuing school year, but the funds appropriated for the bureau did not 
permit. Shortly afterwards the date set for English to become the language 
of the courts was postponed until January 1, 1911. This action, while recom- 
mended by the fact that a laige number of judges and practicing attorneys were 
insufficiently trained in English, had a very unfortunate effect upon public 
confidence in the ultimate adoption of English as the official language of the 
government. Previously there had been a general expectation that English 
would be made the official language throughout the administration. By an act 
passed in the last decades of the Spanish Government the knowledge of 
Spanish was made a necessary qualification for municipal office. The Filipinos 
had regarded the adoption of English as the official language of the courts in 
the light of past experiences and had been exerting themselves accordingly. 
After the passage of the above legislation such activities largely ceased. Not 
entirely, however, for in some towns night schools have been conducted and 
paid for by private subscription, while in Manila night schools supported by the
-P-A-G-E-305
  EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINES. 293 
city have continued, with good results. It seems highly desirable that night 
classes in the provinces should be reopened. Such classes should be limited to 
a certain number of weeks during the winter months, when the people have 
most leisure to apply themselves. They should aim at definite results and fol- 
low and complete special courses of work. Authority exists under the law for 
the director of education to pay for such instruction, though no definite amount 
of money was furnished by the present appropriation bill. If, however, funds 
can be spared from some source, this instruction will be resumed during the 
coming winter. 
The extension of the knowledge of English among the adult people is believed 
to be a matter of the utmost importance and one meriting renewed attention. 
It is to be noted that with the increased study and use of English there has been 
an increased study of Spanish. I think it is a fact that many more people in 
these islands have a knowledge of Spanish now than they did when the Ameri- 
can occupation occurred. As already remarked, an immense impetus has been 
given to private institutions where the instruction is largely in the Spanish 
language. The general demand upon clerks is for a knowledge of both English 
and Spanish. Through the great increase in number and circulation of news- 
papers and periodicals, there is now much more reading of Spanish than 
formerly. But in spite of these facts it is believed that the use of Spanish here 
will wane; it is unsupported by Spanish-speaking countries adjacent to us. On 
the other hand, as has been frequently stated, English is the common language 
of every port from Japan to Australia and Suez. The chance to make Spanish 
the language of the islands existed half a century ago, but it is gone to-day. So 
far as known to me, Spanish is the language of the common people in only 3 
communities—Ermita, a district of Manila; Cavite, and its suburb, San Roque; 
and the Christian colonies of Zamboanga and Cotabato, where a corrupt Spanish 
dialect called ‘‘chabucano ” is spoken. The new generation, which will be fore- 
most in the affairs of the islands in another ten years, will not use Spanish for 
ordinary purposes, and their influence will be decisive. It will cease to be the 
language of the courts on January 1, 1911. It is rapidly ceasing to be the 
medium of administrative correspondence. Probably its longest official use will 
be as the language of the legislature. 
THE FUTURE OF THE NATIVE DIALECTS. 
How will it be with the native dialects? Their number is generally recognized 
as a cause of division; their continuance is an obstacle to the attainment of 
nationality. Few Filipinos, even those who have a scholarly interest in these 
dialects, advocate the continuance of them all. A common medium of communi- 
cation is recognized as essential. The present representative government would 
hardly have been practicable had it not been for the fact that all the members of 
the Philippine Assembly can communicate in Spanish. The growth of common 
consciousness in recent years has been possible because a limited number of 
individuals in every community speak this foreign tongue. There are two 
supposable ways in which a Philippine language might be produced: First, by 
selecting one and suppressing all the others; second, by thoroughly fusing all 
these dialects, retaining the best elements of all. 
As regards the first plan, many look to the Tagalog as the ultimate Philippine 
Janguage. It has the advantage of being spoken in those provinces surrounding 
the capital. It has, moreover, been most influenced by other tongues. Many 
years ago it was pronounced by the great German philologist, William von Hum- 
boldt, to be the richest and most perfect of all the languages of the Malayo- 
Polynesian family. It is, however, spoken only by 21 per cent of the Christian  
-P-A-G-E-306
  294 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
inhabitants of the archipelago. The Visayan, in its several dialects, is spoken 
by more than twice as many. More than this, the Tagalog, in the capacity of 
extending his territory and influence, is surpassed by several other peoples. 
There is not, and there has not been for years past, any considerable expansion 
of the Tagalog people into new regions. Where they are to-day, they were at 
the time of the Spanish conquest, with the exception of the towns of southern 
Nueva Ecija and a part of southern Zambales. But meanwhile the Visayan 
peoples have had an astonishing growth. In 1735 the entire bishopric of Cebu, 
embracing the islands of Samar, Leyte, Bohol, Cebu, Panay, and northern 
Mindanao, yielded only 8,114 tributes, indicative of a population of less than 
50,000 souls. At the opening of the nineteenth century they numbered only 
100,000. In 1903 they were enumerated at over 3,000,000.¢ Their expansion 
still goes on. They are settling up northern Mindanao, and as the present 
uninhabited portions of great islands like Palawan invite settlement, it will be 
the Visayans who colonize them. 
On the north are extraordinary emigrants, the Ilocanos. In nearly all the 
towns of Ilocos there is an annual “swarming.” Whole communities move out 
at once and settle in the rich valleys of the Cagayan and Magat or in the fertile 
plains of Nueva Ecija, Pangasinan, Tarlac, and Zambales. Here is a people 
speaking a language very dissimilar from Tagalog, who will dominate northern 
Luzon, if they do not already do so, down to the provinces of Pampanga and 
Bulacan.~ It is impossible to believe that Tagalog ever will or can make progress 
among the Ilocanos. On the other hand, no Filipino people is more desirous 
for English instruction than the Ilocano or have better prospects of obtaining 
general literacy through the public schools. In view of these conditions, I see 
no chance of Tagalog becoming the language of the archipelago by the natural 
ascendancy of those who now speak it. 
On the other hand, the possibility of making a common language by the sys- 
tematic and scientific fusing of them all seems even more visionary. Filipino 
scholars interested in the development of the Tagalog language have adopted a 
shortsighted policy. In chauvinistic effort at linguistic purity, they are trying 
to eject from the language all words of foreign origin and to substitute cireum- 
locutions or words of new invention. It may be that they are following the 
example of the Tagalog classical poet, Baltazar, but this is not the way in which 
the great languages of the world have grown and spread. Supposing that 
Englishmen of the time of Henry II had persistently cast out from the Anglo- 
French speech of their day every word of Norman or Latin origin, and suppose 
this practice had gone on through the generations since, what would the English 
language be to-day? English has grown, as every other great language has 
grown, by adopting and assimilating the words of other languages. The policy 
adopted by Tagalog scholars for ‘‘ purifying” and perfecting their own speech 
spells its ultimate sterilization and death. 
Up to the end of Spanish rule the Philippine languages were growing by the 
absorption of Spanish, and if this process had been assisted by the schools the 
result would have been striking. I have before me a little compendium of the 
Visayan language as it is spoken on the island of Masbate, prepared some years 
ago by a young Filipino scholar. This little volume contains at a rough count 
514 words, of which at least 184, or one-third, are Spanish or Spanish corrup- 
tions. Of other words are a number borrowed from the Sanskrit, Arabic, and 
Chinese. ‘The Spanish terms embrace such names as days of the week, months, 
many foods, occupations, house furnishings, articles of clothing, tools, some 
domestic animals, some wild animals, many vegetables, nearly all words that

relate to the schools and public buildings, and administration, all names for 
foreigners, and all proper names. The words of Malayan origin include nu- 
merals, parts of the body, pronouns, nearly all birds and fishes, many natural 
objects, and the verbs and adjectives with very few exceptions. ‘This instance 
mmay indicate that the present effort to develop the Philippine languages by 
casting out the foreign element can only result, as it is already doing, in making 
them unintelligible to the mass of the people, and in robbing them of essential 
elements of strength, richness, and utility. 
Feeling in favor of the use of the dialects found expression in a proposed 
law of the last session of the legislature providing for their teaching. This 
proposed bill, in the form in which it was exhibited at one period of its dis- 
cussion, provided that instruction in the dialect of any locality might be given 
in the public schools on request of a local school board and municipal council. 
The idea of the bill was said to be not to disturb the present curriculum in 
English, but to put in the dialect teaching where locally demanded as an addi- 
tional subject. Although many friends of the public schools felt that such a 
measure as this would weaken their teaching and occasion general misunder- 
standing, my own feeling is that it would not have done harm and might have 
introduced instruction of present benefit. It is a very easy matter for a child 
of the second grade to acquire facility in reading and writing his dialect, as 
the syllabary used for the purpose is phonetic and very plain. Some reading 
of proverbs, folk stories, and poetry, of which there is a considerable in several 
languages, could have followed. But the advocates of the measure inserted a 
final clause that the municipalities should have the power to decide in what 
language public instruction should be given. As English was apparently to 
be included in this scope of their authority, such a power would have afforded 
possibilities of immeasurable confusion, and if generally exercised for exclud- 
ing English, would have undone the work of eight years and rendered useless 
over 6,000 teachers trained to teach English. In this form, therefore, the bill 
was reactionary and unacceptable and was fortunately disapproved by the 
upper house of the legislature. . 
If we may judge by what is taking place in all parts of the globe, the Philip- 
pine languages will disappear from use. There is a common belief that these 
mother tongues do not die, and that instead the dominant intrusive population 
always ends by adopting the indigenous speech. While this may be true as 
applied to certain great historical peoples, nothing is more untrue if we survey 
the world at large at the present day. I have such good authority as the word 
of W J Magee that in the century just closed the number of spoken languages 
of the world decreased one-half. Their disappearance is being constantly accel- 
erated. There are scores of languages throughout both Americas which to-day 
are known only by name. Even in such a continent as Africa so eminent an 
authority as Sir Harry Johnson states that no native languages will persist 
except Swahili (itself partly Arabic) and Hausa. Elsewhere the languages of 
Africa will be English, Arabic, French, Portuguese, and Italian. The multi- 
tudinous dialects of the Philippines will likewise disappear. They will leave 
with us an enormous number of place names, many of which are older than the 
languages at present spoken in the locality of these names, names .of trees and 
plants, and a considerable additional vocabulary descriptive of objects native 
te Malaysia. These will all become a part of the English language spoken 
throughout the archipelago. This result will come even though no more is done 
than is being done now. It has already proceeded far enough so that it could 
only be stopped by a complete reversal of policy,

  296 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF RACIAL CHARACTER, 
I can not hope that this prediction will be welcome to a considerable propor- 
tion of thoughtful Filipinos, who are desirous, among other aims, of preserving 
the best qualities of native character. These gentlemen fear the general adop- 
tion of English as likely to result in the loss of the “ Filipino soul.” 
But the triumph of English as the common speech of these islands does not 
by any means imply the suppression of the native character, or the sacrifice of 
any of its excellencies. These fears arise from misunderstanding. The educa- 
tional policy in these islands is not to Americanize or Anglo-Saxonize the 
Filipino. It is not a policy of “assimilation.” Assimilation is fast becoming a 
discredited policy, though it has been a popular programme with the friends of 
more than one backward race who have taken for their standard the stature 
and quality of the white race. French colonial administration has discussed 
and experimented with the assimilation idea. It was put forward by the Span- 
iards in the last decade of their rule in the Philippines, and it was then a popu- 
lar conception with the Filipinos themselves, although it should be noted that 
Rizal possessed the insight to see all its weakness and to refute it in his second 
great novel, El Filibusterismo. In my own view the policy of assimilation in 
all dealings of the white race with other races is a profoundly mistaken one. 
Where accompanied by compulsion is it absolutely indefensible. Not by force 
but by persuasion is the great work of civilization to be accomplished. Profound 
differences of character separate the different races of the world, and these can 
not be broken down by an experience of education. The process of racial dif- 
ferentiation has been a very long one, and while it has left all mankind essen- 
tially one it has left the different races of people differently endowed. While no 
race seems devoid of any human quality or passion, or incapable mentally and 
spiritually of experiencing the highest emotions, these emotions differ in inten- 
sity in different races. Their ensemble is different in one case from what it is 
in another. The white race has frequently claimed for itself a superior mixture 
of qualities of every kind, but what is more probable is that other races, even 
if they do not possess any equally good ensemble, possess at least certain supe- 
rior qualities in a higher degree. At least every race has some elements of 
strength and qualities of greatest serviceability, and its highest development 
does not lie in a slavish conformity to the character of another, but in the wise 
and persistent cultivation of the best qualities of itself. Our effort here is not 
to make Filipinos into Americans, but to make better Filipinos. We do not insist 
that the Filipino qualities of mind and heart shall become those of foreign 
peoples, but that everything shall be done to cultivate the inherent excellencies 
of the race in the best possible way. Moreover, there is that assimilation which 
absorbs one people into the life and character of a stronger race, and that assim- 
ilation by which a people possesses itself of new benefits of civilization and 
utilizes and transforms these in accordance with its own genius. It is by that 
latter kind of assimilation that progress is made, and there is no question that 
the Filipino people possesses this power. They form a race which is destined 
to survive, multiply, and make its influence felt farther than the human mind 
ean forecast. Like other Malayan peoples fortunately situated, this race is 
rapidly multiplying; it is at least 14 times as numerous as it was when the 
Spanish conquered the archipelago, and 5 times as numerous as it was at the 
beginning of the last century. Through all its history it has proved itself capa- 
ble of rapid cultural advance. It has been continually acquiring and assimi- 
lating new elements of civilization. Its indigenous culture, of which certain 
elements speak with favor, was left behind long ago, when their forefathers 
progressed beyond barbarism. The primitive Malayans were forest-dwelling 
 
-P-A-G-E-309
  
  EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINES. 297 
communities without farm animals, who burned their primitive “ caiigins” and 
planted their simple crops with their hands; they worshipped the spirits of the 
woods and the ghosts of the departed; they possessed practically none of the 
arts of civilization, but through successive contact with the civilization of the 
Hindu, the Arab, and the Huropean, these Malayan peoples have steadily devel- 
oped in culture until in the Philippines they approximate the civilization of 
western Europe. The lesson to be learned from this, their own history, is not 
to turn back to their past for ideal or light, but, confident of their own power 
and virility, press on in the effort to bring up their life and civilization to the 
highest standard of the Christian world. 
THE TEACHING OF ETHICS, 
This discussion of the Filipino character brings us to the subject of moral 
instruction and character training in the public schools. Little has been done 
so far by means of direct or didactic teaching. The influence of high-minded 
teachers, the constant effort to maintain a high standard of conduct of all 
teachers and pupils, the prompt punishment of common school faults, con- 
stantly exert an influence in favor of character training which, while it can 
not be estimated, can not be doubted. There should be, as well, intelligent and 
systematic instruction in ethics. Enough has been previously said to indicate 
my own opinion that this instruction should be built upon a clear and sympa- 
thetic understanding of the Filipino character and its own best standards of 
conduct. Certain admirable virtues are taught by the training given in every 
home, but it is undeniable that certain essential virtues are neglected in this 
home training. On this point the school has a responsibility which it has not 
adequately met, partly because the difficulties in the way are great and partly 
because intelligence and understanding have been lacking. Obviously moral 
training can best be given by the Filipino teachers themselves. Some definite 
requirement as to time and amount within the course of study will have to 
be made, and then Filipino teachers will have to be prepared by courses in 
ethics and pedagogy to give this instruction to the children. One of the most 
necessary qualities to inculcate in the Filipino pupil is the love and habit of 
self-reliance. The feeling of dependence, the desire for assistance and pro- 
tection, is inherent in the race. It is a weakness that has been greatly encour- 
aged by a paternal government. It expresses itself in countless ways, but in 
no way more noticeably than in the fervid seeking for official position and 
official privilege. 
GOVERNMENT SCHOLARSHIPS. 
This discouragement of the practice of self-reliance comes close home to the 
bureau of education, because of the large provision that has been made for 
student scholarships. 'These are of several kinds: Government scholarships 
in the United States, the number afforded by the current appropriation bill 
being 130; scholarships in the Philippine Medical School, one for each proy- 
ince of the Philippine Islands (Act No. 1632); nurses’ scholarships for sup- 
porting young women while receiving a training in nursing; municipal schol- 
arships provided by municipalities under the provisions of Act No. 1791; and 
by Act No. 1857, 100 scholarships for municipal and insular teachers to receive 
superior instruction in Manila. * * * 
Provision for government scholarships in America was made in 1903 by act 
No. 854, and was for 100 students. Succeeding appropriations increased this 
provision until the number of students under appointment finally stood at 188. 
 
-P-A-G-E-310
    
298 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
The standard of scholarship of the early appointees was too low for them to 
fully benefit by the instruction in American institutions, and in 1907, by reso- 
lution of the commission, the examination for appointment was made the equiv- 
alent of the completion of a secondary course of study. This higher standard 
has resulted in very few appointments during the last two years, but there will 
probably be a number of competitors able to qualify at the end of this school 
year.* Of 196 students who have been appointed to these scholarships 2 have 
died while under appointment, 5 have been obliged to return on account of ill 
health, 7 have been dismissed for misconduct, 60 others have returned from the 
United States, their terms of appointment having been completed, and have been 
appointed to government positions, 40 in the teaching service, 11 to clerical 
positions, 2 to the position of subinspector in the constabulary, 2 as draftsmen, 
1 as a pharmacist, 1 as court interpreter, 1 as agricultural foreman and inocu- 
lator, 1 as computer in the bureau of lands, and 1 as private secretary to one of 
the congressional delegates. The majority of these young men have now been 
under appointment from eight to ten months. An effort has been made to learn 
of the quality of their service; 6 are unreported upon, the service of 5 is reported 
as “poor,” 7 as “ fair,” 22 as “good,” and 20 as “superior.” There will re- 
turn to the islands this summer 43 students (4 of them being young women), 
of whom 11 have taken courses in civil engineering, 3 in mechanical engineering, 
1 in chemical engineering, 11 in agriculture, 6 in teaching, 4 in medicine, 2 in 
domestic science, 1 in architecture, 2 in law, 1 in forestry, and 1 in pharmacy. 
Under the terms of the law these students may take not more than sixty 
days of vacation after their arrival in Manila and are then under obligation 
to accept appointment to a suitable position in the government service and 
to enter appropriate civil-service examinations to secure eligibility for regular 
appointment. Not counting those students who are returning this summer, 
there remain in the United States 76, in addition to whom there are 3 who haye 
resigned their scholarships and are in the employ of the Federal Government; 
there are also 4 others, recently appointed, who are awaiting transportation to 
the United States. 
In addition to the 10 original scholarships in nurses’ training, it is gratifying 
to report that 4 others were privately provided last year, and 2 other young 
women took this course at their own expense, a total of 16. For the present 
academic year provision has been made for 30 government scholarships, and 9 
other young women have been provided with scholarships through private 
generosity. * * * 
EDUCATION OF GIRLS AND WOMEN. 
The Philippines are fortunate among countries of the East in the position 
occupied by women. In the social life of the country they have a place as 
influential and respected as that of the men. The woman’s influence in the 
household, in the direction of household affairs, and in the business interests 
of the family is preponderant. Filipinos seem to regard the judgment of the 
women as being cooler and wiser and it is ordinarily adopted. Women are 
engaged in all sorts of occupations; besides being venders and hucksters, they 
are shopkeepers and frequently commission merchants on a considerable scale. 
There are many women of wealth who hold property independently and manage 
it themselves. This is a condition which gives the Philippines a great advan- 
tage over other oriental countries. On the other hand, while the woman’s influ- 
ence is fully equal to that of the man in domestic and practical affairs, they 
  
«The actual number of appointments for the different school years is as follows : 1903-4, 
105 ; 1904-5, 40; 1905-6, 87; 1906-7, 10, 1907-8, 4; total, 196.

have not enjoyed equal privileges of education until recently. Lately a number 
of women have taken law courses in private schools of Manila, though I am 
informed that none has passed the bar examination. There are 3 women 
students in the Philippine Medical School. Of 6,804 Filipino teachers, insular 
and municipal, regular and temporary, 2,108 are women. A considerable num- 
ber of young women fill positions in public offices. The director of civil service 
states that during the last five years 1,371 young women have entered civil- 
service examinations in English, of whom 269 passed a teacher’s examination 
and 158 a clerical examination. Since the organization of a modern telephone 
system in Manila, they have filled the positions of telephone girls, and in the 
stores of Manila there is commencing to be an increasingly large number en- 
gaged as accountants, clerks, and saleswomen. Girls do not, however, attend 
the public schools or any schools to the same degree as do boys. The disparity 
between the sexes in the primary schools is 137,974 girls to 221,923 boys. In 
the intermediate schools the difference is even greater. There were last year 
2,898 girls and 10,481 boys in such schools, while in the secondary course, out 
of 1,324 students only 240 were young women. While there may always be a 
greater demand for highly trained men than for highly trained women, social 
improvement in the Philippines depends upon an educated body of women no 
Jess than upon a similar body of men. 
THE INSULAR SCHOOLS IN THE CITY OF MANILA, 
THE PHILIPPINE NORMAL SCHOOL. 
Provision for this school was made in the act organizing the bureau of edu- 
cation, and it was first opened in 1901 with a total enrollment of 349 students. 
In 1902-3 the number of students was 398; and 9 pupils, who had previous 
instruction in Spanish schools and were somewhat advanced in subject-matter, 
were given diplomas of graduation, although there was no definite standard 
of attainment; in 1903-4 the enrollment was 455 students, and of this number 
14 were graded as secondary students when the prescribed course of study went 
into operation, The attendance’ on this school has steadily risen each year, 
being 554 in 1904-5; 645 in 1905-6; 733 in 1906-7; and 809 in 1907-8. What 
is even more gratifying is the higher standard of work attained. In 1906-7 
200 of these students were secondary pupils, while in the last school year the 
number was 286. The secondary courses are very thorough, and the instruc- 
tion, equipment, and standard are believed to be on a par with that of the best 
high schools of the United States. Including the early graduates, there have 
been a total of 99 normal graduates and 4 graduates from a high-school course. 
Graduates from the normal course are placed by the bureau of civil service on 
the list of eligibles for appointment as insular teachers without subsequent 
examination. For the practice teaching, as well as for model and experi- 
mental purposes, intermediate, primary, and kindergarten departments are con- 
ducted. Those taking the normal-school course have practice teaching in the 
primary grades in their third year, and in the intermediate grades in their 
fourth year. The school since its organization has been housed on the “ Expo- 
sition Grounds” in Ermita in buildings erected by the Spanish Government in 
1895 for a Philippine exposition and subsequently used as a school of agricul- 
ture. These buildings, while for the most part of a temporary character, have 
been kept in a state of repair and, with ample and well-shaded grounds, have 
served the purpose admirably. In a way, this school and its site on the ‘‘ Expo- 
sition Grounds” has been an educational center for the work of the bureau of 
education. Here have been held the vacation assemblies, and the Philippine 
 
-P-A-G-E-312
  800 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
School of Arts and Trades for several years occupied buildings on the same 
grounds. In connection with the normal school and because no other public 
school in the city of Manila was affording such instruction, courses in prepara- 
tion for different professions have been opened from time to time. These in- 
clude a course in preparation for medicine, that for appointment as magistrate 
or for entrance to a law school, that for admission to an engineering school, a 
Secondary course in agriculture, another-in domestic science, and one in prepa- 
ration for nursing. In addition to these, a general high-school course has 
also been conducted. The excellent laboratories in botany, zoology, including 
anatomy, physiology, and histology, in physics and chemistry, as well as the 
number of specially qualified teachers at this institution, have been reasons 
for consolidating here these varied kinds of instruction. At the present time 
these additional courses are more largely attended than that in teaching. Of 
334 secondary students enrolled July 23, 1908, only 60 are taking the course 
in teaching, 75 are preparing for medicine, 33 for law, 33 for engineering, 18 
are taking the agricultural course, 17 domestic science, 41 are preparing for 
nursing, while 67 are taking the regular secondary course in literature, science, 
and history. 
Other professions are appealing more strongly to students in the school than 
that of teaching, and the fundamental purpose of the institution as a training 
center of teachers for the entire archipelago is not being fulfilled. One cause © 
of this may be the fact that graduates of the normal school on entering the 
teaching service have received a compensation which is not attractive enough 
in view of their long course of preparation. This entrance salary is ®600, the 
same being the maximum entrance salary of a clerk who has passed the second- 
grade English examination. A pupil who has completed the intermediate course, 
and has had four years less training than the normal-school graduate, can pass 
the second-grade examination and receive an equal rate of pay. In justice to 
the long and superior training taken by graduates of the normal school a higher 
entrance salary should be paid. 
The special training now being given by the normal school will be brought into 
some sort of relation to the work of the Philippine University, whose establish- 
ment is authorized by legislation of the last sessions of the Philippine legisla- 
ture. It would seem that the work of the university might grow in a natural 
manner out of the foundations laid by the normal school. Up to the present 
the normal school has had a history which is believed to be unique in usefulness 
in the career of educational institutions. By influence, in one way or another, 
thousands of pupils and teachers have received help and inspiration, and by the 
thorough instruction given a large number of young people are receiving excel- 
lent training. In addition to its other numerous services, the normal school 
during the last year conducted a department of correspondence teaching. This 
course was authorized on June 20, 1907, to be given to Filipino teachers who 
had completed the intermediate course of instruction. There were so recom- 
mended 634 teachers, but owing to the inadequate supply of suitable texts, so 
large a number could not be provided with the facilities for study and only 
814 took work in English, while 19 attempted work in algebra. Of the students 
in the English course, 168 persisted through the year and 114 did work that was 
satisfactory. This first year was experimental, but it demonstrated the advan- 
tage of conducting such correspondence, especially as more and more the regular 
instruction of Filipino teachers by supervising teachers has to be given up. 
THE PHILIPPINE SCHOOL OF ARTS AND TRADES. 
Provision for the establishment of this school was made in the act organizing 
the bureau of education. It was opened in the city of Manila late in 1901. For 
 
-P-A-G-E-313
EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINES. 801 
two years great difficulty was encountered in securing students, and there was a 
Jack of equipment, no machine tools having been supplied the school. In 1905 
some disused stables and wagon barns on the “ Exposition Grounds” were fitted 
up for the use of this school and the first engines and machinery procured. This 
change, with its equipment, introduced a new spirit into the school, which began 
to attract a desirable class of young men. A year ago the school moved into 
better quarters—the old “Arroceros” grounds and shops owned by the city— 
with an agreement for the use of these premises for five years. The school now 
has the following departments, all well equipped with excellent machinery and 
tools: Carpentry, blacksmithing, wheelwrighting, machine shop, wood carving, 
drafting, and weaving. There were 538 students in attendance last year. Dis- 
tinctive trade work is given to boys and young men who simply desire to be 
mechanics. This instruction is given in all the trades mentioned above. 
In addition, a general four-year course in manual training is given to students 
who desire this work as a preparation for some branch of engineering. The 
course embraces one and a half years of carpentry, one semester of blacksmith- 
ing, and two years of machine-shop practice, with mechanical drawing through- 
out. The school also conducts a normal training department for the preparation 
of teachers to give instruction in tool work in elementary industrial schools and 
in intermediate schools. The outlook for the school at present is encouraging, 
but the present buildings are insufficient and a permanent site and plant must 
be secured. 
‘ THE PHILIPPINE SCHOOL OF COMMERCE. 
Until the opening of the present year this school was known as the Manila 
Business School. It is now an insular school and will offer the secondary course 
in commerce, a course which later can be introduced, it is hoped, into many 
of the high schools. The most serious industrial need of the archipelago is 
capable, trained Filipino men of business. Philippine commerce at present 
struggles under a severe handicap due to the undeveloped state of three fac- 
tors—markets, systems of transportation, and the system of credit. The great 
wholesale establishments of Manila, Iloilo, and Cebu are for the most part in 
Buropean, American, or Chinese hands. These large companies conduct their 
own trading and transportation and make loans. Meanwhile there are in every 
part of the archipelago excellent small business openings not sufficiently large, 
perhaps, to attract the European, but admirable opportunities for young Filipino 
men who are willing to commence modestly. Such openings at the present time 
are taken advantage of only by one class of residents—the Chinese. It is the 
development of these small businesses in large number that will-do most to 
forward the economic development of the archipelago. To stimulate such an 
interest, to train young men for these businesses, and to disseminate intelligent 
information about them is the aim of the secondary course in commerce. It will 
also undertake to train in public finance a class of young men who may in this 
manner become qualified to fill positions in the provincial treasury and revenue 
services. At the present time the work given in the Philippine School of Com- 
merce, while having this large plan in view, is varied and general. There is an 
attendance of 266 students enrolled in the following courses: Commerce and 
bookkeeping, 60; stenography, 35; typewriting, 25; telegraphy, 42; intermediate 
business course, 104. Night classes were opened in the month of July with a 
present enrollment of 153 pupils. 
SCHOOL FOR THE INSTRUCTION OF THE DHAF AND THE BLIND. 
One other insular school opened in Manila at the beginning of the present 
academic year. This is a small school for instruction of the deaf and the blind. 
A year ago an accomplished and experienced teacher was engaged in the United 
   
-P-A-G-E-314
  802 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
States, who the past year has conducted experimental work instructing a small 
number of deaf children at the normal school. A considerable number of deaf 
children have been reported from adjacent provinces, but with parents of such 
small means that no private provision could be made for their attendance upon 
an institution to give them instruction. Authority was consequently obtained 
to pay the expenses, not to exceed #20 per month, of 20 deaf children, and to 
open a home for them in the city of Manila. This has now been done, and at 
the opening there are 11 children in attendance. Provision will be made within 
a very short time for the instruction of blind children, of which unfortunate 
class there is in the islands a large number owing to the prevalence of smallpox. 
SCHOOLS FOR NONCHRISTIAN PEOPLE. 
THE NEGRITOS. 
Outside of the Moro Province the pagan peoples may be divided, for the 
purpose of this report, into three divisions—the Aetas or Negritos or little 
black aborigines, the uncivilized forest Malayans, and the mountain-dwelling 
Igorots. 
Of the Negritos or Aetas there are probably somewhere between 25,000 and 
30,000. They are found on a number of islands, including Luzon, Panay, 
Negros, Mindanao, and Palawan; but the largest known groups of them are 
found in the Zambales Mountains, in the forest and hill country of Camarines, 
and in western and northwestern Panay. There is an unknown number in 
the Sierra Madre Mountains, which extend for nearly 200 miles along the 
Pacific coast of Luzon, but nothing is known of them except in 3 localities, at 
the northern end of this mountain chain, the coast facing Palawi Island, in 
the mountain country between Ilagan and Palanan, and near the Pacific coast 
in the jurisdictions of Baler and Infanta. Indeed, the entire Pacific coast 
of northern Luzon has only 3 or 4 Christian towns, and has been very little 
explored. There are small groups of Aetas in the Cordillera of Luzon within 
what is properly Igorat territory. An element that once existed on the island 
of Mindoro has been absorbed into the Mangyan. There are a few in the 
mountainous parts of the island of Negros. There is a small group around 
Lake Mainit, Surigao, who are known as “Mamanua.” Occasionally indi- 
viduals or even family groups are met with elsewhere. Two statements 
made in regard to these little blacks have been widely repeated: First, that 
they are rapidly disappearing; second, that they are quite incapable of cultural 
improvement. Both of these statements I consider to be untrue. While the 
Negrito has disappeared from many places where he was found in the past, 
at the present time he appears to be holding his own, and, in defiance of the 
second assertion, in many communities he is making really notable progress, 
considering his primitive condition of savagery. When unaffected by outside 
culture, these little black forest dwellers probably depend upon game and the 
quest of honey, wild foods and roots; they use the bow and arrow, but not the 
blow gun or “sumpitan,” which is the projectile weapon of the primitive 
Malayan; their habits are strictly nomadic; at one time they probably never 
constructed anything except the rudest shelters of branches. But at the 
present time in many places the Negritos have partially or entirely ceased 
their nomadic wandering and settled down in well-established small com-| 
munities. Here they have built houses, or at least permanent huts, and they| 
have learned from the Malayans their method of forest cultivation, and tol 
plant crops of mountain rice, maize, beans, taro, yams, and tobacco. In barter} 
with the Christian population they exchange wax, rattan, and forest produc 
for clothing, iron, salt, and other necessaries. In the mountains of Angat,
-P-A-G-E-315
    
EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINES. 303 
Bulacan, they do a great deal of lumbering; in the hill communities of 
Camarines many of them have set out rather extensive fields of abacfé. From 
their Malayan neighbors also they have learned primitive iron working, and in 
some communities fashion their own knives and arrow points. They almost 
always have dogs, and in some cases fowls, swine, and even a few carabaos. 
Now, these are very considerable steps in culture as contrasted with their 
primitive forest condition, and are sufficient to refute the statement that the 
Negrito can not any more change his savagery than the leopard his spots, 
Schools have been opened for them in 5 localities—in the Bucao River Valley, 
Zambales; in the Tarlac River Valley, Tarlac; in the mountains back of Florida 
Blanca, Pampanga; and in the provinces of Camarines and Antique. The plan 
is to help introduce the culture of the adjacent Christian people and at the same 
time to give a certain measure of oversight and counsel, and, by opening in the 
vicinity of each school a trading place, protect them from exploitation which 
they now suffer. Some reading and writing, knowledge of money and values, 
calculating and figuring are being taught, and they are anxious to have these 
matters understood by their young people. It is believed that the Negritos may 
be persuaded to form more settled communities and to devote themselves more 
generally to agriculture. What will be the future of these little people it is 
somewhat hard to say. In the Camarines and in some other places they have 
to a considerable degree been absorbed into the Bicol population. In other 
places it seems, however, that they will remain communities distinct in race, 
although their culture will approximate that of the Christian people. In 
addition to the pursuit of agricultural life, they will remain the expert foresters 
that they are now, and with their ability to travel the woods and the mountains 
they will contribute to the products of the islands those peculiar to the jungle, 
which is their natural home. * * * 
THH IGOROTS. 
For the Igorots of the Cordillera of Luzon the problem is a much larger and 
more important one. Here we have a mountain population of several hundred 
thousand souls, full of vigor and hardihood. These people are not organized in 
tribes but in communities or towns, some of them conipactly built up and con- 
taining several thousand inhabitants. They are among the most remarkable 
barbarous populations of the world. In physical and mental endowment they 
seem to be inferior to no people in the archipelago. They have brought their 
steep and forbidding mountain into a remarkable state of habitableness by the 
construction of thousands of wonderful terraces and systems of irrigation. 
They mine gold and copper, and among their beautiful handicrafts are iron- 
working—spears, axes, and knives of varied form and fine workmanship—cotton 
weaving and dyeing, copper beating, brass casting, pottery, basketry, and rattan 
work. During the last decades of its rule the Spanish Government occupied 
most of this Cordillera with military forces. Cuartels or garrisons were estab- 
lished in many places, and these were connected by trails or mountain horse 
roads. Missionaries of the Augustinian and Dominican orders established mis- 
sions in most of these “ commandancias; ” the Government undertook to vaccinate 
the people and went so far as to attempt schools. Coffee and cattle raising were 
introduced. 
Following the breakdown of Spanish Government and the retirement of the 
Spanish troops and missionaries from the Cordillera, most of the results of their 
work were swept away. The cuartels and missions were in many places 
destroyed, the roads grew up with the jungle, and when the American Govern- 
ment, five years later, sought to reoccupy these mountains, there was little to 
 
-P-A-G-E-316
  804 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
indicate the former presence of the Spanish soldier and missionary. Left to 
themselves, these head-hunting communities were then engaging in a perfect 
orgy of feuds. These conditions do not apply to Benguet nor to parts of the 
province of Lepanto, but almost everywhere else confusion and head-hunting 
reigned. In 1902 the American Government began the task of organizing gov- 
ernments for the control and benefit of these peoples. The task has been suc- 
cessful, and although Igorot communities still covertly take heads from one 
another, the best of feeling prevails between the Igorots and the Americans. 
Owing to the pacific conditions which prevailed in Benguet while the rest of 
northern Luzon was either in a condition of insurrection or intercommunity 
feud, this province was the first region to secure civil government under the 
American rule. At the same time a considerable force of American teachers 
was sent there and opened schools in at least 8 of the towns. This was in 1901. 
American teachers were sent to Lepanto-Bontoc in 1902. Subsequently schools 
were opened in the former Spanish posts or “comandancias” of Amburayan, 
Banaue, Quiangan, and Tiagan, and within the last year at Mayoyao, Kalinga, 
and Apayao. Within recent months the school administration of these two 
provinces has been united in a single school division known as the ‘“ mountain 
division.” It will probably be wise to unite all parts of the Cordillera in a 
single school division and have all school work for the Igorots conducted under 
one superintendent and in conformity with a single policy. 
Schools for Igorots are of two kinds—industrial boarding schools, to which 
children come from more or less distant towns, and village schools conducted 
in the Igorot communities. Of the former schools 5 were conducted during the 
last year, at Baguio, Benguet, for boys; at Bua, Benguet, for girls; at Alilem, 
Amburayan; Cervantes, Lepanto; and: at Bontoc; a boarding-class was con- 
ducted for the last few months of the year at Banaue, and in April a boarding 
school with 32 little giris was started at Bontoc. The plan of these schools is 
to give the children a comfortable home, food, and clothing, and a training in 
tool work and agriculture, as well as in academic subjects. Until the last school 
year there was no adequate provision for buildings for these schools. There 
have now been constructed a good dormitory and shopbuilding at Baguio; at 
Bua the girls’ school is housed in a building only in part of wood; the school 
at Cervantes occupies a large recently completed wooden building; at Alilem 
the buildings are of light materials; and at Bontoc a boarding school building 
was erected in 1902, but lately had to be torn down owing to faulty construc- 
tion. Its materials have been utilized in putting up a smaller building which 
accommodates the school for little girls, and 130,000 bricks have been made 
under the direction of the supervising teacher for the erection of a new school 
building. ci adhpeaee 
My own opinion of industrial boarding schools for these people is that while 
they are apparently necessary in order to train boys from villages where it would 
not be possible to send a teacher, they are not ideal educational institutions. 
If carried too far and made too large they are likely to show all the objection- 
able features of Indian boarding schools in the United States. By removing 
the boy from his home they educate him in some degree away from his com- 
munity, which also loses the benefit of the presence of the school. As fast as 
Igorot boys can be trained as teachers, village schools will be opened. This 
plan has already been carried out in some degree, utilizing in many cases the 
services of young Ilocano teachers. Hleven village schools were conducted last 
year in Benguet; in Amburayan, 5; and in Lepanto and Bontoc 13 more. In 
Ilocos Norte and Ilocos Sur schools of a similar character were conducted for 
the Igorot and Tinguian villages in those provinces. The best results obtained 
in any of these village schools are seen in the supervising district of Cabayan,
-P-A-G-E-317
  
  EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINES. 805 
the Agno Valley of Benguet Province. Seven of the teachers are young Igorot 
men. In all of these towns there are school gardens. Basket making is taught 
at Bocot, pottery making at Daclan, blacksmithing and carpentry at Cabayan. 
At Cabayan, Declan, and Bocot cloth weaving is taught the girls. Fourteen of the 
looms were made by the Igorot people and are the property of the girls using 
them. Five good school buildings have been put up, all of them, with one ex- 
ception, made of pine lumber, laboriously hewn out by Igorot axmen. These 
buildings were put up without cost to the government, except for the nails, 
paint, and glass. In the supervising district of Cayan, Bontoc, by using Igorot 
skilled craftsmen, instruction was given in iron forging, pottery making, and the 
casting of brass. Six new village schools have been opened in the district of 
Bontoc this year. The people have voluntarily built the schoolhouses. The 
work in Abra merits special mention. Here the Tinguian, while not differing 
ethnologically from the inhabitants of the higher mountains, stand in plane of 
culture midway between the Ilocano and Igorot. They are peaceful, well dis- 
posed, and prosperous. They have shown themselves extremely eager for 
schools, and no less than 23 village schools were conducted last year in Abra 
among the Tinguian, with an attendance of 940 children. * * * 
AMERICAN TEACHERS. « 
By Act No. 74 of the Philippine Commission provision was made for appoint- 
ment of 1,000 American teachers. There were never, however, this number on 
duty at any one time, the highest number reached having been 928 in March, 
1902. In 1905 the number allowed by law was reduced to 861; in 1906 it was 
further reduced to 800; in 1907 it was raised to 820; and at the present time it 
is fixed at 795. Owing to the conditions of the service, a certain number of 
teachers resign during the course of each school year, and these separations 
are most numerous at the conclusion of each school year in March, so that the 
beginning of each school year in June finds this bureau short of a considerable 
number of teachers. On June 30 last there were in the bureau under regular 
appointment 722 American teachers, of whom 535 were men and 187 women. 
Of these, all but 85 have civil-service examination status. 
As regards their scholastic attainments, of the total of 722, 253 are college 
graduates, representing 130 colleges and universities; of these institutions the 
University of California graduated 12; the University of Michigan, 10; the Uni- 
versities of Indiana and Chicago, 9 each; the Universities of Kansas and Iowa, 
7 each; Harvard, Cornell, and Stanford, 5 each; Yale, Boston, State College 
of Kentucky, and Nebraska, 4 each; the Universities of Missouri, Ohio, Illinois, 
Drake, Purdue, Colby, Dartmouth, Georgetown, Lake Forest, St. Charles, Oliver, 
Asbury, Grove City, and Holy Cross, 3 each. There are 108 teachers who are 
graduates of normal schools. The educational attainments of the rest of the 
corps are various; many have completed a part of a college or normal course, 
and 9 have the degree of bachelor of laws. 
Much has been said relative to the instability of the teaching service. The 
force does change considerably from year to year, but of regular teachers in 
service June 30 the service of 6 dates from 1900, of 133 from 1901, 35 from 
1902, 52 from. 1903, 188 from 1904, 56 from 1905, 90 from 1906, 118 from 1907, 
and 94 from 1908. From this it appears that 364, or about 50 per cent, were 
appointed previous to 1905, while 139, or 19 per cent, were appointed previous 
to 1902, and have a period of service in most cases amounting to seven years. 
This table does not take account of the directors and superintendents, who 
were appointed to the teaching service as follows: In 1900, 2; in 1901, 34; in 
9228—rp 1909—voL 1——20  
-P-A-G-E-318
  
  806 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
1902, 3; in 1904, 1; total, 40. I think these figures demonstrate a greater sta- 
bility of the teaching force than is ordinarily supposed. Certainly few branches 
of the Philippine service can show a directive staff so generally composed of 
men whose entrance into the service was contemporaneous with the organi- 
zation of civil government. It is also encouraging to be able to state that there 
is a growing desire on the part of teachers formerly in the service to return 
after one or two years of absence in America, These teachers are especially 
desirable because of their previous experience. There were 28 reinstatements 
of this sort made during the school year ending June 380, 1908, as against 11 
reinstated in the previous year. 
During the past year the bureau lost 132 teachers. Of this number 113 
resigned, 3 were dismissed for the good of the service, and 16 were transferred 
to other bureaus of the government; among these, 2 went to the bureau of agri- 
culture, 2 to the bureau of audits, 2 were appointed deputy provincial treas- 
urers, and 1 became chief clerk in a provincial treasurer’s office, 1 was appointed 
treasurer of the non-Christian province of Agusan, 1 was appointed lieutenant- 
governor of the subprovince of Amburayan, and 1 assistant to the governor of 
Agusan, * * * 
FILIPINO TEACHERS. 
A limited number of Filipino teachers are insular teachers, appointed by the 
director of education as a result of civil-service examination, with temporary 
insular teachers appointed in the absence of regularly qualified appointees. 
Municipal teachers are appointed by division superintendents under regulations 
prescribed by the director of education, and are paid from municipal school 
funds. The former class was created to render assistance to certain munici- 
palities whose school funds were lacking, and also to make the teaching service 
more attractive by providing a limited number of positions superior in remu- 
neration and tenure to those of the municipal service. On June 30 there were 
282 under regular appointment. The mean salary for these positions is about 
600 annually; there were 83 drawing less than this figure and 113 drawing 
more. There were also 339 under temporary insular appointment. Of munici- 
pal teachers there were last year 6,211 engaged, of whom 4,212 were men and 
1,999 women. Filipino teachers have been segregated into two classes, regular 
and temporary; the regular are those who have passed an examination pre- 
scribed by the superintendent of the division and whose academic attainments in 
school efficiency are of recognized grade; temporary teachers are those who have 
not these qualifications and who receive not an annual salary but a monthly 
wage for the actual time in which they are engaged in giving instruction. The 
average salary for the entire archipelago is 18.39 per month for men and 
P18.70 for women; for temporary teachers, #15.54 for men and #18.92 for 
women. In spite of the fact that the qualifications of teachers have risen 
steadily, this is actually a less average salary than was paid in 1904, when the 
average salary of men teachers was 20.76 and of women teachers #20.99. This 
is a reduction of salary to an amount insufficient to maintain a family, and 
below the wage of manual labor in many parts of the archipelago. * * * 
The fact that on an average and quite generally women teachers receive a 
little more than men teachers speaks well for the character of their service. It 
is, however, in large part attributable to the fact that barrio school positions are 
filled by very young men, students just out of intermediate or high schools, who 
are induced to begin their service at a low rate of compensation. It would not 
be possible to secure teachers for the service were it not for the fact that they 
receive a training and education in general school subjects during their period 
of teaching, but after this training is secured and the teachers become really

valuable they leave the service that promises so little. The time has come when 
the salary of municipal teachers will have to be paid on a satisfactory business 
basis. An average compensation of at least ®30 per month will be necessary. The 
attainments of these teachers are steadily rising. When it is considered that 
the great majority have received their entire academic instruction, as well as 
their professional training, since the American occupation, it is an important 
achievement to have produced over 6,000 teachers able to give primary and in 
some cases intermediate instruction in the English language. These are graded 
for academic attainments in the same manner as school children, and carry on 
studies that are primary, intermediate, or secondary. From time to time they 
are required to pass examinations, as a result of which, and of their regular 
work, they are advanced in grade. Out of the total of 6,786 reported on (in- 
cluding 575 insular teachers) 5,041 are classified as intermediate teachers. The 
class of teachers who have not yet completed the primary course is disappear- 
ing. While still found in a few provinces, it is probable that during the present 
year teachers with such slight attainments will be entirely dispensed with or 
graduated out of the primary studies, with the exception of certain teachers 
of arts and handicrafts. who are engaged, not for their book knowledge, but for 
their manual skill. Those in the intermediate course were classified last year 
as follows: Grade V, 1881; Grade VI, 1825; and Grade VII, 1335. There are 
709 teachers pursuing secondary studies who are classified: First year, 619; 
second, 41; third, 88; and fourth year, 11. For the purpose of this examination 
of their attainments, insular teachers have been included with municipal teach- 
ers. These perform services as class-room instructors, as principals of inter- 
mediate schools, and as supervising teachers. In the last-named positions execu- 
tive ability, fidelity to duty, and influence with the people of the community are 
requisite. How well Filipino teachers are suited by character and present 
attainments to fulfill this duty is an interesting and important question. As 
above stated, 70 are either serving as supervising teachers, assistant super- 
vising teachers, or acting supervising teachers. It seems to be pretty thoroughly 
demonstrated that certain Filipino teachers are able to do this work as well

SCHOOL BUILDINGS AND LANDS. 
Under the Spanish Government, in pursuance of a plan for public instruction 
commenced about 1860, a primary school for boys and one for girls was author- 
ized for each pueblo. Buildings in many cases were durably constructed of 
stone. They usually consisted of one or two large class rooms, with several 
small rooms for the accommodation of the family of the teacher. They fronted 
on the town plaza, and their capacity varied from 40 pupils to 200. Many of 
these buildings were destroyed during the insurrection and many others were 
occupied for military purposes, so that comparatively few were available when 
the public schools were reorganized in 1901. Practically all required extensive 
repairs—new roofs, new floors, and new doors and windows—before they could 
be reoccupied. In 1904, 534 of these buildings were in use in 374 municipali- 
ties; in 1905 the number in use had risen to 726; the present number probably is 
not in excess of this figure. 
The primary school buildings put up under the American Government may 
be roughly classified into two sorts—those constructed of permanent materials, 
stone, concrete, or hard wood, with iron roofing, and those built of “light mate- 
rials,’ usually a wooden frame, with roofing, sides, and partitions of “nipa” 
and “ swali,” the floors being either of wood or bamboo. The construction of 
buildings of permanent materials has been slow, but 25 or 30 having been erected

  308 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
in municipalities each year. Of light-material buildings 369 were completed 
and about 600 more undertaken in 1904. Most of these were in part erected 
through the distribution of rice purchased with congressional relief funds and 
turned over to the bureau of education to be expended for schoolhouse construc- 
tion. A large number of these buildings were destroyed in the disastrous 
typhoon of 1905, but the construction, commenced through the use of this rice, 
continued through the voluntary efforts of the people, so that the year 1905 
saw a total of 1,697 buildings put up under the American Government, of which 
46 were of “strong materials,” 269 of “ mixed materials,” and 1,382 of “ light 
materials.” In the same year a campaign was commenced to secure satisfactory 
high-school grounds and buildings, the matter receiving especial attention in the 
report of the general superintendent for 1904. This effort resulted in 19 build- 
ings being erected in 1906 for provincial school use and the beginning of the 
construction of 17 more, and in the erection or reconstruction of 2 buildings for 
intermediate schools at Indang, Cavite, and Bacolor, Pampanga. At the close 
of the year 1906, 2,454 primary-school buildings were owned by the municipali- 
ties, and of these 298 were constructed during that year. * * * :

INSULAR APPROPRIATIONS. 
Money provided for public instruction is of three sorts, insular, provincial, 
and municipal. An insular appropriation for the bureau of education pays the 
expenses of administration and supervision, the salaries of American and 
Filipino insular teachers, cost of text-books, school equipment, tools and ma- 
chinery, expenses of schools for the education of non-Christian peoples, for the 
support of students in the United States, and other expenses. The amount ap- 
propriated for the bureau of education for the last fiscal year was $3,510,000; 
to this amount must be added #85,951.14, the unexpended cash balance remain- 
ing to the credit of the bureau at the close of the preceding fiscal year which 
was available for the payment of outstanding obligations chargeable to that 
year, and #33,598.42, received during the year from the sale of books and other 
school supplies, making a total of *8,629,449.56 available for expenditure.. Ex- 
penditures have amounted to ®3,402,119.59. * * * 
The second class of school revenues are funds appropriated or otherwise 
secured by the provincial governments. These are used mainly for the con- 
struction, rental, and care of provincial school buildings. Salaries of instructors 
in these institutions and school supplies are at present provided by the bureau 
of education in pursuance of a policy adopted in 1904. During the last fiscal 
year provincial school funds aggregated #377,729.86. 
Insular and provincial school revenues are, however, in a fairly satisfactory 
condition compared with the deplorable inadequacy of municipal school revenues. 
The Municipal Code (act No. 82), enacted January 31, 1901, provided a munici- 
pal school fund for the conduct of primary instruction, to be raised by the col- 
lection of a land tax of one-fourth of 1 per cent upon all assessable property. 
It was further provided that the municipalities might increase this tax to one- 
half of 1 per cent and that they might, out of their general revenues, contribute 
by appropriation to school funds. 
During the fiscal years of 1902 and 1903 school funds were badly adminis- 
tered, due largely to the demoralization that attended municipal government 
during these years of pestilence and disorder. In 1903 an arrangement which) 
originated in Bulacan by an understanding between the provincial treasurer 
and the school superintendent, and gave the superintendent control over munici-| 
pal school expenditures, was made generally effective throughout the archi-
-P-A-G-E-321
    
EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINES. 309 
pelago. Under this arrangement municipal school finances were rapidly organ- 
ized and put upon a satisfactory basis of expenditure. They have since that 
time been admirably handled. They have, however, been made very uncertain 
and subject to shrinkage by changes of legislation. For the fiscal year ended 
June 30, 1908, the amount of municipal school funds in Christian provinces was 
¥1,797,547.67, of which the land tax yielded #960,269.65; appropriations made 
by municipal councils from their general funds, #451,488.79; loans from general 
fund, 15,106.58; from 5 per cent of the internal revenue, which first became 
available that year, #114,193.23; and from receipts from all other sources, in- 
eluding balance on hand July 1, 1904, #256,539.42. Considering the unsatis- 
factory condition of school funds in previous years, this was an encouraging 
showing. It appeared that school revenues might steadily improve and keep 
pace with growing needs. It is significant that in that year there were volun- 
tary contributions to the value of #232,998.382, and that a large number of mu- 
nicipalities voted to increase the one-fourth of 1 per cent to three-eighths or 
one-half of 1 per cent and to devote the added tax to schools.

The following notes are taken from an historical review of educa- 
tion in Porto Rico, entitled “ The progress of a decade, 1899-1908,” 
contained in the report of the commissioner of education of the island, 
Dr. E. G. Dexter, to the governor, dated September 21, 1908: 
At the time of the American occupation there were upon the island 380 pub- 
lic schools for boys, 148 for girls, and 1 for adults. In addition to these there 
were 26 private schools, making a total of 555. In the public schools were en- 
rolled 25,664 children, with an average attendance of 18,243. 
311
-P-A-G-E-324
  812 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
The course of study in the elementary public schools consisted of Christian 
doctrine and elements of sacred history, reading, writing, elements of Spanish 
grammar, elements of arithmetic, with legal weights and measures and money, 
the merest elements of geography, and an elementary outline of agriculture, 
industry, and commerce. 
In the superior schools the following subjects were added: Elements of geom- 
etry, lineal drawing and surveying, elements of history and geography, espe- 
cially those of Spain, an elementary outline in physics and natural history 
adapted in their application to the needs of common life. 
On the 30th of October, 1898, there was held in the theater of San Juan, 
P. R., a mass meeting of citizens, at which the following resolutions were 
adopted : ; 
“As regards public education, the best means of advancing our people would 
be kindergartens and normal schools, as established in the United States. Our 
elementary and superior schools should be transformed and graded according 
to modern pedagogic methods. Secondary instruction should be a continuation 
of the primary and a preparation for the superior and collegiate. Universal 
education should be introduced on the best models of the United States. There 
should be established schools for adults, Sunday schools, schools of arts and 
trades, libraries, museums, academies of fine arts, and literary clubs. 
“Education must be obligatory and gratuitous, and it must be compulsory on 
every municipality to sustain its own schools, the number being fixed by law 
with reference to the population. If the municipality be unable to sustain all 
the schools, the State should establish the necessary ones. 
“Grades of instruction should be three—the fundamental, or that given by 
the public schools; the secondary, which should give positive notions on 
scientific, civil, and technical subjects; the professional, which comprehends the 
knowledge of jurisprudence, medicine, engineering, and technology, the uni- 
versities to diffuse general knowledge of science for purposes of high culture. 
“For the formation of a competent body of teachers it is necessary to estab- 
lish normal schools for teachers of both sexes, normal schools for professors, 
normal schools for university teachers, and military and naval schools.” 
The fact that these resolutions were adopted precisely twelve days after the 
original military government in Porto Rico seems to indicate not only that 
there had been a deep-seated interest in educational matters on the part of the 
Porto Ricans, but also that they did not delay in making a public expression 
of that interest. 
General Brooke, the first military governor, seems not to have found, with his 
many duties, time to give his attention to the school problem. He was, however, 
succeeded as military commander on December 6, 1898, by Gen. Guy V. Henry. 
General Henry not only showed an interest in educational matters in the island, 
but in a somewhat definite way seems to have had an opinion as to what it 
was necessary to do. In any event, one paragraph of his address delivered upon 
assuming command was as follows: 
“The system of school education should be looked into, and it is my desire to 
ascertain how many teachers they (the municipalities) can pay to teach the 
American or English language, commencing with the younger children. It is 
believed that those who can speak English only can accomplish the purpose by 
object lessons. It is thought that American women, for teaching, can be 
obtained for $50 a month in gold, and they are well worth it. The young 
children are anxious to learn, and now is the time for them to do so. If alcaldes 
will report to me how many teachers they can employ, they will be brought 
from the United States and sent to these towns.”
-P-A-G-E-325
EDUCATION IN PORTO RICO. 313 
With what preliminary steps on the part of the military government I am not 
able to say, but on December 31, 1898, three weeks after the inauguration of 
General Henry, Gen. John Eaton was appointed by the Secretary of the Interior 
of the United States as an expert to visit Porto Rico and reorganize the school 
system. He arrived in January, 1899. It would have been difficult to find a 
man whose experience better fitted him for the difficult task than General 
Eaton. He had been superintendent of public instruction for Tennessee; United 
States Commissioner of Education; a college president; the representative of 
the United States Government at various international expositions besides 
haying occupied many other posts of great educational importance. In addition, 
he was an author of no mean repute and bad risen to the rank of general in 
active service in the civil war. 
Immediately upon his arrival General Eaton devoted himself to a study of the 
schools of the island as they had existed under Spanish control, and in the 
course of two or three months had formulated quite an elaborate school law, 
which appeared as general orders from the military governor. 
In the organization of the government General Eaton was made chief of the 
bureau of education, which was a subordinate division in the department of the 
interior, to the directorship of which Hon. Federico Degetau y Gonzalez had 
been appointed. 
Under General Eaton’s charge were not only the educational institutions of 
the island, but also the charitable institutions, including the asylum for the 
insane. 
As his assistant, practically from the start, General Eaton had the efficient 
services of Dr. Victor S. Clark. Doctor Clark is a graduate of the University 
of Minnesota; had taken postgraduate studies at the University of Chicago, 
Gottingen and Berne, Switzerland, receiving his doctorate of philosophy at 
Columbia in the year 1900. He was a man eminently fitted for the work which 
he had to perform, and much of the success of the early educational movement 
upon the island seems to be due to him, 
Upon May 1, 1899, the code of school laws prepared by General Eaton, pre- 
sumably with the aid of Doctor Clark, was issued as a general order by General 
Henry. 
The code provided, first, for a local school organization of 5 members in any 
barrio or township of the island, and defined fully the duties of such officers. 
General plans were also given for taxation and bonding of the school districts 
thus constituted. This part of the code seems to have failed largely, since 
organization was merely permissive and not mandatory. Orders were, however, 
issued six months later which obviated this defect. 
The second part of the code dealt with the details of public instruction and 
did not go into effect until July 1, 1899, or after the completion of the school 
year in progress at the date of their issue. As outlined by Doctor Clark in his 
first educational report,? the specific orders were as follows: 
Order No. 1 abolished the fee system and made the public schools entirely 
free to pupils of all classes and degrees. 
Order No. 2 limited the school year to nine months of twenty days each. 
Order No. 3 established a system of graded schools in the towns where schools 
had heretofore been ungraded; limited the number of pupils which any single 
teacher might receive to 50; and required that there should be a principal in 
every school employing more than 4 teachers. 
@ Senate Document No. 363, Fifty-sixth Congress, first session. 
 
-P-A-G-E-326
    
314 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
This order further required that wherever practicable the different grades of 
a school should be located in the same building, and determined the minimum 
floor area of 14 square meters for each pupil. 
Order No. 4 outlined the course of study. Church doctrine and religion were 
dropped; the required subjects were to be Spanish, English, arithmetic, and 
geography, with the elements of United States history and civil government, 
while the minor subjects of music, drawing, manual training, hygiene, and 
morals were provided for wherever teachers were competent to give instruction 
in these branches. 
Order No. 5 established the legal qualifications for teachers. 
Order No. 6 fixed the salaries of public school teachers at $75 per month for 
principals, $40 and $50 per month for graded teachers, and $30 per month for 
rural teachers. 
Order No. 7 made provision for free text-books. 
Order No. 8 defined the relation of municipalities to public schools, and 
required the local school board to provide buildings, supplies, such as paper, 
ink, and chalk, school furniture, and residences for teachers. 
Order No. 9 gave municipalities full authority to elect properly qualified 
teachers for their local schools. 
Orders Nos. 10, 11, and 12 provided for the establishment of high schools, 
normal schools, and such professional schools as might be necessary in the 
island. 
On July 8, 1899, a general order was issued by the military governor, estab- 
lishing the first board of education under the American Government. 
Less than a month later, August 12, 1899, the bureau of education was 
formally discontinued, the insular board taking its place. 
The board so constituted functioned as the highest educational authority on 
the island up to the beginning of civil government, May 1, 1900. On that date 
the Foraker Act went into effect, and since one of its provisions was the ap- 
pointment by the President of a commissioner of education, the insular board 
ceased to exist. 
Dr. M. G. Brumbaugh was the first presidential appointee to the position of 
commissioner. He did not arrive upon the island until August 4, 1900. During 
the intervening three months Dr. George G. Groff, the president of the insular 
board of education, acted as commissioner. Doctor Brumbaugh was one of the 
best-known educators in the United States, and did work upon the island which 
is very fresh in the memory of Porto Ricans as a class, by whom he was much 
beloved. A graduate of Juniata College, Huntington, Pa., he did post-graduate 
work at Harvard and at the University of Pennsylvania, being the recipient of 
the master’s degree and of the doctorate of philosophy and of the doctorate of 
Jaws. At the time of his appointment to Porto Rico he was professor of 
pedagogy in the University of Pennsylvania. He has published a considerable 
number of public school text-books, and many articles of pedagogical nature in 
magazines. 
The school law promulgated by General Henry was in operation. At the first 
session of the Porto Rican legislature, however, he succeeded in passing what 
has been since that time the fundamental school law of the island, Although 
it has been amended in many particulars, some of them important, at each 
session of the legislature since, still much of the original law is in force, 
In January, 1901, in answer to application made to the President of the 
United States, the sum of $200,000 was transmitted by the Federal Government 
to the treasurer of Porto Rico to be used for school extension in Porto Rico, 
Plans were immediately formulated for the proper use of this fund and 18

.school buildings were projected. These in each case were given to such 
municipalities as would donate at least an acre of suitable land. 
The legislature having appropriated a sum for the purpose, all school books 
and supplies were now furnished by the department of education, greatly im- 
proving conditions formerly existing, when many of the children were not 
supplied with the necessary books and material. 
During the spring of 1901 teachers’ institutes were organized, lectures being 
given by Hon. O. T. Corson, ex-school commissioner for the State of Ohio, and 
the Hon. Henry Houck, for many years deputy superintendent of public instruc- 
tion for the State of Pennsylvania. These institutes were a great success. 
On February 8, 1902, Doctor Brumbaugh resigned the office of commissioner 
and Dr. Samuel McCune Lindsay was appointed by the President to take his 
place. 
Doctor Lindsay was a well-known educator, sociologist, and author. He is a 
graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, having taken postgraduate courses 
at the universities of Pennsylvania, Halle, Berlin, Vienna, Rome, and Paris, 
receiving his doctorate of philosophy at the University of Halle. Doctor 
Lindsay was for some time secretary of the National Child Labor Association 
in New York and is at present professor of social legislation at Columbia 
University. 
Upon Doctor Lindsay’s arrival in February he found already established, in 
addition to the system of graded schools and the high school at San Juan, a 
normal school at Rio Piedras for the training of teachers. The building for 
this school was then in process of construction, having been transferred from 
Fajardo to Rio Piedras by Doctor Brumbaugh, and was dedicated May 30, 1902. 
This building had been erected at a cost, including the ground, of $35,000, and 
is situated about 7 miles from San Juan. Twenty-one frame rural and agri- 
cultural schools had also been completed. In addition to the above there had 
been completed 14 brick buildings for graded schools, all of them substantial 
structures, the plans and specifications being prepared in the department of 
education. There were also in process of construction 8 more graded school 
buildings, the total cost of the 17 graded-school buildings being about $140,000 
exclusive of the land donated by the municipalities. 
In response to an appeal from Doctor Lindsay the trustees of the fund 
allotted by the President of the United States consented to the use of the 
further sum of $150,000 for school buildings. This sum was immediately 
allotted for the erection of a graded-school building, a frame building for the 
residence of the principal of the normal school, and for the erection of rural 
and agricultural schools. 
A new plan was instituted for the construction of the graded-school buildings, 
whereby the municipalities were required to pay one-half the cost of the build- 
ings in addition to providing the land. In order to facilitate the operation of 
this plan, a bill was passed giving the municipalities the right to levy a special 
school tax, not exceeding one-tenth of 1 per cent, on all personal and real prop- 
erty, in addition to the regular property tax, to be collected by the treasurer of 
Porto Rico and turned over directly to the school board to be used exclusively 
for school purposes. At the same time another law was passed raising the 
minimum per cent of all taxes which the municipalities were required to turn 
lover to school boards for school purposes from 10 to 15 per cent. 
During this fiscal year over $38,000 were expended for text-books and sup- 
plies, and the further sum of $29,000 for school furniture. 
There being about 100 pupils who had completed eighth-grade work, provision 
was made for these in the high school at San Juan, and in addition the first

courses being provided, one given in Spanish, the other in English. 
The legislature at its session of 1902 passed a bill providing for the establish- 
ment of industrial schools in the cities of San Juan, Ponce, and Mayaguez, the 
sum of $40,521 being made available for the maintenance of these. schools. 
In addition to the rural, agricultural, graded, and high schools, there were in 
operation a number of special schools, including night schools, with special in- 
struction in typewriting and stenography in addition to arithmetic, reading, 
writing, etc. The experimental kindergartens had also done good work and 
had aroused much enthusiasm among the parents. The legislature also provided 
for the establishment of 3 schools for the training of nurses under the direction 
of an American trained nurse graduated from one of the best schools in Boston. 
The legislature during its session of 1901 passed a law providing for the 
establishment of scholarships in the United States, as follows: Twenty-five 
scholarships in colleges and universities of the United States, each beneficiary 
to receive $400 per annum during four years; and 20 scholarships in industrial 
and manual-training schools in the States, each beneficiary to receive $250 per 
annum for a term of four years. The former scholarships were open to young 
men only, the latter to both sexes. During the year 1902, 45 students were en- 
joying the benefits of these scholarships in the States. 
The insular normal-school building was dedicated on May 30, 1902, with an 
attendance of over 125 pupils, and funds were allotted for the addition of a 
practice-school building. 
During the session of the legislature in 1903, in addition to the law providing 
for the compiled school law, two important bills were passed, one providing 
for the establishment of the University of Porto Rico and the other creating 28 
scholarships in the normal school, open to both sexes. The law providing for 
the establishment of the university provided also that the government of the 
university should be vested in a board of trustees appointed by the governor of 
Porto Rico. The law provided that the university should consist of several 
departments, first in order being the normal department, to be known as the 
insular normal school, and to be dedicated to the training of teachers. 
During the summer of 1904 the department of education organized an eight 
weeks’ trip to the States for Porto Rican teachers for the purpose of study at 
the summer schools of Harvard and Cornell universities. Five hundred and 
four teachers of Porto Rico went to these universities and received instruction 
during the summer. ‘The department commenced its preparations for the proper 
carrying out of this excursion in the summer of 1903, and secured, first, an act 
of Congress authorizing the use of army transports. 
After the securing of transportation it became necessary to devise some plan 
whereby the necessary funds for the expenses of the expedition could be secured. 
It was estimated that the cost per capita, including meals on transports, board, 
lodging, tuition at the summer school, and one week’s travel, enabling the 
teachers to see the cities of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Washington, 
would be $100. It was decided to ask the teachers themselves to contribute one 
month’s salary. This they did, promptly and cheerfully, and their total contribu- 
tions amounted to $21,175.57. Over $20,000 in addition were contributed by the 
people of Boston, New York, and Philadelphia, half of this amount coming from 
Boston, due in a great measure to the interest and indorsement of President; 
Eliot, of Harvard. 
This excursion was a great success, and the teachers returned to Porto Rico 
on the 22d of August, delighted with their stay in the States and the experience| 
acquired.

EDUCATION IN PORTO RICO. 317 
In September, 1904, Doctor Lindsay resigned the commissionership, and 
Dr. Roland P. Falkner was appointed by the President in place of Doctor 
Lindsay. 
Doctor Falkner was a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, having 
received the degree of Ph. B. He studied economics at Berlin, Leipzig, and 
Halle-on-Saale, Germany, being the recipient of the degree of Ph. D. at Halle. 
At the time of his appointment to the office of commissioner of education 
Doctor Falkner was Chief of the Division of Documents, Library of Congress, 
Washington, D. C. 
During the year 1904-5 three high schools were in operation in the island, at 
San Juan, Ponce, and Mayaguez, with an average attendance in the high-school 
department of 106 pupils as compared with 78 the previous year. Industrial 
schools were also maintained in the cities of San Juan, Ponce, Mayaguez, and 
Arecibo under direct appropriation of the legislature, and under the general 
fund at the disposal of the department of education for the maintenance and 
establishment of industrial schools a school was also established at Guayama. 
Of the agricultural schools, 11 were conducted with an attendance of 506 
pupils, as compared with 466 the year before, and 37 night schools were 
maintained, with an enrollment of 768. P 
Teachers’ institutes were conducted during 1904-5, the same plan being 
followed as in former years. 
In January, 1905, a revised course of study for the rural schools was issued, 
the department having under consideration during the summer of 1905 a new 
course of study for graded schools. 
During the summer of 1905 special classes in English were held in the school 
districts of the island. These classes continued during a period of five weeks, 
with an enrollment of over 500 Porto Rican teachers. In order to assist the 
American teachers to acquire a working knowledge of the Spanish language, a 
course of study was suggested, and text-books for learning Spanish were sup- 
plied by the department to all who applied for them. Examinations in elemen- 
tary and advanced Spanish were held by the department and certificates issued 
to those who successfully passed these examinations. 
During the school year 1905-6 the department of education employed 158 
American teachers, 127 serving as teachers of English. 
Industrial schools were originally established in San Juan, Ponce, and 
Mayaguez, and later other schools were opened in Guayama and Arecibo. Oppo- 
sition to these schools had been growing since the time of their establishment, 
and in the legislative session of 1905 a strong effort was made to overthrow 
them. A compromise was, however, effected by which the schools of San Juan, 
Ponce, and Mayaguez were maintained, but those of Guayama and Arecibo 
abandoned. In the year 1905-6 the position of supervising principal of indus- 
trial schools was abolished, and grading in academic work was made entirely 
different from grading in the shopwork. Notwithstanding these and other 
changes, it appeared that public opinion was opposed to the work of these 
schools, and in the legislature of 1906 appropriations for these schools were 
stricken out of the budget by the house of delegates and a law passed abolish- 
ing the industrial schools as constituted, but merging their material and equip- 
ment with one of the boys’ and girls’ charity schools into a new organization to 
be known as a “School of arts and trades.” This bill, however, did not reach 
the executive council until too late, and was therefore not considered. 
The legislature of 1907 also established 50 scholarships in the high schools of 
the island, to be assigned to the most, promising graduates of the eighth grade  
-P-A-G-E-330
  318 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
throughout the island. The appropriation for salaries of the common schools 
was increased to $500,000, and by a special act a large and adequate piece of 
public land was donated to the school board of San Juan for the erection of a 
school building. Perhaps the most important act of the legislature of 1907 was 
the establishment of a school-building fund. The law provides that school 
boards who apply for assistance from the fund shall furnish the necessary sites 
and agree to repay, in a period not exceeding ten years, one-half the cost of 
erecting the buildings. 
Teachers’ institutes were held under the supervision of the department in all 
the districts of the island, and in the budget of 1907 an appropriation was 
secured for the maintenance of summer schools. 
These were in charge of an American teacher as director, assisted by one or 
more Porto Rican teachers. In all these instruction in English was the common 
feature. 
COURSE OF STUDY. 
In consonance with the demands of progress several revisions of the course 
of study have become necessary during the decade. The first was made eight 
years ago by Commissioner Martin G. Brumbaugh, when the insular board of 
education turned over the school system established under the military govern- 
ment. The course which he presented in his report for the year 1900-1901 was 
based upon the best and most fruitful experience in American schools, and by 
its form of presentation emphasized those elements most necessary to a well- 
balanced training. 
In the report for 1906 Commissioner Falkner said: “The course of study for 
the graded schools of the island was prepared some years ago, and was based 
largely upon the experience of American schools. Local needs had not then 
been sufficiently felt to exercise much influence in shaping the course. To-day 
these needs are better, if not wholly, understood. * * * The old course was 
based upon the supposition that the instruction was to be given in Spanish, with 
the teaching of English as a special subject only. It has already been noted 
how this condition is gradually passing away, and it can readily be inferred that 
the former course of study was thereby rendered useless.” 
In mentioning the course of study prepared for that year Doctor Falkner empha- 
sized the following points: “The work to be covered in the eight grades is the 
same, whatever the language employed in the school, but it will be differently dis- 
tributed, according as English or Spanish is the predominant medium of instruc- 
tion. As in our several districts we have all possible combinations in this 
respect, the preparation of a new course of study immediately applicable every- 
where was out of the question. Accordingly it was assumed that instruction in 
the first grade should be given in Spanish, and from the second grade upward in 
English.” 
The principal changes effected are such as to provide for more instruction in 
the use of English. 
During the coming year (1908-9) all tests and examinations on English 
suggested by the department will be based upon the language books. Mean- 
while the course in reading is being strengthened, and in Ponce, where for the 
first time the first-grade work is to be done wholly in English, a test of new 
methods in the teaching of reading will be inaugurated. It is the intention that 
in the reading, as well as in the language work, interest shall be stimulated by 
putting a book hitherto unknown to him into the hands of each pupil upon his 
advancement to a higher grade.

  EDUCATION IN PORTO RICO. 319 
SECONDARY EDUCATION. 
While the record of the development of primary education is a most interest- 
ing chapter in the history of the past decade in Porto Rico, no less significant 
is the story of the establishment and quiet growth of secondary instruction. 
Upon the disappearance of those institutions which afforded opportunity for 
higher education prior to the inauguration of the American system of public 
schools, the necessity for replacing them with schools more in keeping with the 
new order of things became at once imperative. Perforce, the first attempt at 
meeting the need was tentative; for the problems peculiar to this phase of 
the task to which the educational authorities had set themselves were quite 
different in certain essentials from such as had been met and answered in the 
establishment of similar institutions in the United States. In other words, those . 
in charge of public instruction in Porto Rico were without adequate precedents. 
Among the difficulties, there was the question of language—whether instruction 
should be given in Spanish or in English; there was also a lack of an efficient 
corps of teachers for the work of the primary grades; and, finally, there existed 
a certain obligation to furnish instruction in pharmacy to a body of students 
whose training had been interrupted by the disappearance of the schools first 
mentioned. 
A summer school established in San Juan, July, 1899, with an enrollment of 
76, of which number a majority were teachers taking a normal course, marks 
the beginning of the new secondary education. At the opening of the school 
year of 1899-1900, the school was continued in the same edifice, the diputacion 
building, under the name of the “normal and training school.” The enrollment 
increased to 238, of this number 49 being enrolled in the high-school department. 
At the same time a high school with an enrollment of 50 was established in 
the city of Ponce. In January, 1900, the school in San Juan was moved to a 
new frame building erected by the military authorities near Fort San Cristobal. 
This structure was destroyed by fire one week after the close of the school year. 
A fact worth recording at this point is this, that instruction in the high schools 
during this period was wholly in English. 
The experience of the first year called for modifications in the original plan. 
It was seen that to proceed on an English basis alone was premature, and would 
continue to be impracticable until pupils were prepared to enter upon their 
secondary -education with a thorough working knowledge of the English lan- 
guage. Owing to the large number of pupils in San Juan who were unable to 
pursue their studies in English, it was decided to establish a Spanish high 
school and an English high school, joining the graded department to the latter. 
So, at the beginning of the school year 1900-1901, the normal and training 
school was discontinued, and its high-school department was reorganized under 
the name of the “high and graded school.” In Ponce the same plan was 
adopted, but it did not go into effect until the year 1902-8, when a class of 15 
pupils were admitted from the graded department to the work of the ninth 
grade. With the close of the year 1904 the Spanish high school disappeared 
in San Juan, so that both San Juan and Ponce began the next year with high 
and graded schools in which the instruction was given in English. 
Such changes as have occurred since 1905 have been made largely on account 
of the more general use of English throughout the whole system of schools. 
The number of Porto Ricans able to conduct classes in English had increased to 
such proportions by 1905-6 that it was decided to employ as many of them as 
should successfully pass a test prepared for the purpose to teach grades in : 
   
-P-A-G-E-332
  320 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
English. Enough were found to take charge of nearly all of the first, second, 
third, and fourth grades in the schools of Ponce and San Juan. It was there- 
fore decided to retain only the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth grades with 
the high schools. Thus, in 1905-6 the secondary institutions came to be known 
popularly as the “ high and grammar schools,” under which name they continued 
up to the end of the decade. 
A high school was established in Mayaguez in 1903-4, from which two classes 
have already graduated. At Fajardo, where it was expected that a high school 
could be developed, the conditions have not been favorable to its organization. 
UNIVERSITY OF PORTO RICO, 
The University of Porto Rico was established by an act of the insular legis- 
lature approved March 12, 1903, as an organization for the gradual development 
of facilities for higher education in Porto Rico. This law vested the govern- 
ment of the new institution in a corporation known as the board of trustees of 
the University of Porto Rico, of which the governor of Porto Rico is honorary 
president and the commissioner of education is president ex officio. It provided 
the board with an income from the insular revenues and authorized the solicita- 
tion of federal and private aid. It established a normal department by trans- 
ferring the insular normal school with its grounds, buildings, equipment, and 
current appropriation from the department of education to the board of trustees 
of the university. It provided the basis of an agricultural and mechanical 
department by transferring to the board of trustees a farm of 100 acres in 
Rio Piedras, previously purchased by the commissioner of education at a cost 
of $9,700 out of the general school extension fund—a fund constituted from 
customs on Porto Rican importations collected before 1901 and refunded by the 
Federal Government on the institution of free trade. And it authorized the 
organization of the following additional departments, in the order given, as 
soon as the necessary funds should be available: A department of the natural 
sciences and engineering, a department of liberal arts, a department of medicine, 
a department of laws, a department of pharmacy, a department of architecture, 
and a university hospital. 
The normal department was organized on July 1, 1903. A department of 
agriculture was established in October, 1904. Plans for the opening of a 
mechanical department during the coming school year, to be attached either to 
the normal department or the agricultural department, are now under considera- 
tion. Appropriation was made by the legislature of 1908 for a new college of 
agriculture and mechanic arts, the erection of which will be begun this autumn. 
No other departments have been actually attempted. The hope of the founders 
that private donations would be forthcoming has never been realized, and their 
hope of federal aid was not realized until May, 1908, when an allotment under 
the Morrill Act was received; and the income accruing from insular revenues has 
not been great enough to permit further extension. 
NORMAL DEPARTMENT. 
The normal department is situated on a tract of 23 acres lying along the 
military road at a distance of 7 miles from the capital. Its three buildings, the 
normal school, the practice school, and the principal’s dwelling, are valued at 
$33,500, and its other property as follows: Land, $6,500; apparatus, $800; 
library, $1,655; other equipment, $2,800. 
This department offers to graduates of the eighth grade of the public schools 
a two-year and a four-year course in normal training. At the end of the two
-P-A-G-E-333
ee ee, ee 
EDUCATION IN PORTO RICO. 321 
years pupils receive an elementary certificate. This entitles them to a graded 
license which enables them to teach in the graded schools if they have attained 
the legal age of 19. If not they receive a rural license subsequently changed : 
for a graded license when the legal age has been attained. On the completion 
of the four-year course a diploma is given which entitles the holder, after one 
year’s teaching in the public schools and on reaching the age of 21 years, to a 
principal’s license. The department offers to graduates of high schools a one- 
year course also leading to the diploma. A table is here submitted showing the 
number of pupils enrolled, pupils graduated, and teachers employed in each of 
the years since the school became a part.of the university, and another, taken 
from the school census made on February 28, 1908, showing the ages of the 
pupils enrolled at that time.

First semester.—Theory of teaching, psychology, music, drawing, nature study or ele- 
mentary agriculture. 
Second semester.—Practice teaching, school management, special methods, manual 
training or domestic science. 
The courses in elementary agriculture, manual training, and domestic science 
appear in the curriculum for the first time. All subjects, with one or two 
exceptions in the scientific branches, are taught in English, signal progress in 
the introduction of this language having marked the normal school since its 
inception. 
The normal department of the university, though administered separately, 
forms an integral and a most important part of the public-school system, and 
already the graduates of the normal school are exerting a most helpful influ- 
ence in insular education. This fact is recognized by the legislature in the 
requirement that tuition shall be free and in the regular maintenance of 
scholarships for needy students. Since 1903, 38 scholarships have been main- 
tained at an annual cost of $5,460, and beginning with 1908-9, 75 scholarships 
will be maintained, at a cost of $15,000 annually. These scholarships are 
awarded with careful regard to equal geographical distribution and the major 
part of them are always available for students of the first and second year 
classes. 
AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT. 
The agricultural department was organized in October, 1904, on the farm of 
100 acres located in Rio Piedras and adjoining the normal-school property, 
which was transferred to the board of trustees in the act establishing the 
university. The farm was then in a state of abandonment, overgrown with 
brush, and in need of draining, fencing, and roads. It had but one building, 
an uncompleted farmhouse, and of its 100 acres not more than 4 were under 
cultivation. On June 30, 1908, the property of this department was valued as 
follows: Land, $12,555; buildings, $8,500; apparatus, $400; live stock, $1,125; 
other equipment, $700 ; roads, ditches, and fencing, $725 ; standing crops, $3,934.45. 
Twenty acres were under cultivation in pineapples, oranges, cocoanut palms, 
small fruits, and grasses. 
The first class of students was enrolled in February, 1905. At the beginning 
the farmhouse was used, under great difficulties, for schoolroom, dining hall, 
and dormitory, and the teaching force consisted of the director and the matron, 
the faculty of the normal school furnishing all instruction in the academic 
branches. Later a school and dormitory were erected, and the number of 
teachers was increased to 5. The number of pupils enrolled, graduates, and 
teachers employed in 1907-8 was as follows: Enrolled, 39; graduates, 8; 
teachers, 5. 
The following is the course of study adopted, requiring three years’ residence 
and leading to a certificate in elementary agriculture: 
First year.—Agriculture, mathematics, English, Spanish. 
Second year.—Agriculture, mathematics, English, physiology. 
Third year.—Agriculture, horticulture, animal husbandry, farm bookkeeping. 
A review of the expenditures for school purposes for the ten years ending | 
June 30, 1908, shows that a total of $7,423,225.97 has been disbursed by or under 
authority of the department of education. e

CHAPTER VII. 
EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS IN THE ARGENTINE 
REPUBLIC AND CHILE. 
By L. S. Rows, Ph. D., LL. D., 
Professor of Political Science in the University of Pennsylvania, Delegate of the United 
States to the Pan-American Scientific Congress held at Santiago, Chile, December— 
January, 1908-9. 
The great work of educational regeneration undertaken by the 
United States Government in Cuba, Porto Rico, and the Philippine 
Islands has aroused widespread interest in all matters relating to 
the countries of Spanish civilization. This newly awakened interest 
comes at a most propitious time, for it is coincident with a clearly 
defined movement throughout South America to profit by the ex- 
perience of the United States in educational matters. 
Heretofore the South American countries have accepted European 
educational methods without question. In fact their intellectual 
stimulus has proceeded almost exclusively from European sources. 
In Brazil, in the Argentine Republic, and in Peru, French influence 
has been dominant; in Chile, German methods have been followed, 
especially in the organization of secondary education. 
Acquaintance with educational aspirations and educational prog- 
ress in South America is a matter of far more than passing interest 
to teachers in the United States. In the course of two prolonged 
tours through South America during the past three years not only 
were innumerable requests for material and data relating to American 
educational methods received, but also constant inquiries for compe- 
tent men and women to take charge of educational institutions. 
Although it was comparatively easy to furnish all the data re- 
quested, the problem of supplying candidates for the available posi- 
tions has presented great difficulties. These difficulties have been due 
in part to the uncertainty of tenure in some of the countries, and in 
others to the lack of preparation of American teachers for the posts 
in question. Fortunately the uncertainty of tenure is rapidly dis- 
appearing, for most contracts now read for a minimum period of 
five years, and what is more important, their provisions are carefully 
observed. 
The inadequate preparation of American teachers for service in 
Latin-American countries and their lack of adaptability constitute 
323  
-P-A-G-E-336
  
  324 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
the most serious obstacles to the efficient performance of a service 
which practically all these countries are now asking of us. 
Owing to their greater adaptability the Germans have been able 
to supply competent teachers wherever and whenever the opportunity 
has presented itself. The ease with which they acquire foreign 
languages, together with their quick appreciation of the point of view 
of the country in which they settle, gives to the Germans a position 
of marked influence in educational affairs. Thus in Chile, German 
ideas have dominated the system of secondary education. The faculty 
of the pedagogical institute, from which all high-school teachers are 
graduated, is composed almost exclusively of Germans. 
It is likely that the teachers returning from the Philippine Islands 
and Porto Rico will furnish a considerable contingent of available 
candidates for positions in Latin America, but there still remains the 
serious defect of the lack of adaptability of the average American. 
At bottom, this lack of adaptability is due to a certain provincialism 
of the American mind. Much of this can be remedied by giving to the 
study of Spanish and Spanish-American history and institutions a 
more important place in our normal schools; at least making these stud- 
ies elective for those who may be looking forward to foreign service. 
The small group of American normal-school teachers brought by 
President Sarmiento to the Argentine Republic furnishes a most 
striking instance of the possible influence of a corps of carefully 
selected teachers. Although the immediate activities of these teachers 
were confined to the city of Parana, their influence has extended 
throughout the Republic. At the Parana Normal School were trained 
the educators who have reorganized educational methods in the 
Argentine Republic, introducing modern pedagogical standards. 
To-day the names of this small group of American teachers are 
revered throughout the country. 
Fortunately, the desire of the people of South America to profit by 
the experience of the United States comes at a time of awakened and 
increasing interest in Latin-American affairs in the United States. 
Independent of the possibility of sending American teachers to assume 
charge of South American institutions, our educational experience 
can not help but be of great value to our neighbors. This service 
consists not so much in a bodily transplanting of the American edu- 
cational system as in impressing upon educators throughout Latin 
America the necessity of greater elasticity of curricula and of closer 
adaptation of educational methods to local needs and local con- 
ditions. The increasing complexity of our primary and secondary 
curricula, together with the tendeney to introduce with each year new 
subjects of instruction, has resulted in many cases in an overloading 
of the course of study. In spite of the danger, however, our system
-P-A-G-E-337
    
EDUCATION IN ARGENTINA AND CHILE. 825 
has maintained an elasticity of form and an adaptability in applica- 
tion to local needs quite unknown to most of the South American 
countries. 
’ The most serious defect of educational organization in the Argen- 
tine Republic, Brazil, Chile, and Peru is this tendency to impose the 
same course of study on every boy and girl, quite irrespective of their 
tastes or subsequent vocation. From the primary school to the close 
of the high-school course not the slightest freedom of choice is per- 
mitted. It is true that in all of these countries there exist industrial 
and commercial schools, but up to the present time these schools 
have occupied a subordinate and inferior position, the sons of the 
wealthier families avoiding them because of a well-defined social 
prejudice against this type of education. 
The result is that in Brazil, the Argentine Republic, and Peru, and 
to a certain extent in Chile, the great mass of boys and girls who 
advance beyond the primary grades are required to follow a course of 
study patterned in large measure after French models and intended 
to prepare for the liberal professions, especially law and medicine. 
Even from this point of view the course of study is open to much 
criticism, largely because of its rigidity and complexity, but its most 
serious defect is that it encourages a great number of young men, 
best fitted for commercial or industrial life, to enter callings for 
which they have no real capacity. It is true that this tendency is 
traceable to an inherited Spanish prejudice against trade, but this is 
all the more reason why the educational system should be so adjusted 
as to overcome, or at least counteract, such prejudices. The’ ambition 
of almost every family in these countries is to have their sons enter 
the legal or the medical profession, which has resulted in a degree of 
overcrowding unknown in any other portion of the civilized world. 
This is, however, by no means the most serious consequence. The 
manifest tendency of so large a proportion of the intelligent young 
men to enter the legal and medical professions, together -with the 
existing social prejudice against trade, has robbed these countries of 
their best talent in those fields in which they stand in greatest need 
of carefully trained men and women. It is largely due to this fact 
that*important native business houses are the exception rather than 
the rule. The large fortunes of native-born Argentinians, for 
instance, have been built up on the increasing value of real estate, 
due to the natural growth of the country rather than to commercial 
or industrial initiative or enterprise. Industrial enterprises requir- 
ing constant application and assiduous attention are in the hands of 
foreigners.   
@ Owing to the marked German educational influence, Chile has escaped some of the worst 
consequences of this system. 
 
-P-A-G-E-338
  
  326 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
It is here that the Latin-American countries can secure their most 
valuable lesson from the experience of the United States. The re- 
markable development of our industrial and commercial schools 
represents the most conspicuous educational contribution of the 
United States. The freedom of choice by which a student upon 
entering the high school may, without the slightest loss of standing, 
elect any one of three or four possible courses has been of incalculable 
service to the country. It has given to trade and industry some of 
the best talent and capacity instead of making these callings the 
residual claimants for those who for one reason or another may be 
unfitted to follow the so-called “liberal professions.” All the Latin- 
American countries require a change of attitude toward commerce 
and industry as compared with law and medicine. The system of 
secondary instruction can be so adjusted as to contribute toward this 
end. 
Another lesson of American experience of much importance to the 
Latin-American countries is the necessity of training a corps of pro- 
fessional teachers for the “ liceos,” or high schools. Chile is the only 
country that has made an important move in this direction. In the 
Argentine Republic the teaching corps of the high schools, or 
“ colegios,” as they are called, is made up of practicing lawyers and 
physicians. The result is that there is an almost total absence of 
that personal contact between pupil and teacher which is the distin- 
guishing characteristic of our educational system. A move in the 
right direction has been made in the high school attached to the 
national university of La Plata. In fact, under the direction of the 
president and vice-president of this institution, Doctor Joaquin Gon- 
zalez and Doctor Agustin Alvarez, a new spirit is gradually being 
introduced into the Argentine educational system. In order to make 
the high schools fulfill their real purpose it will be necessary first to 
raise salaries to a level which will attract competent men, who will 
make a career of these positions rather than, as at present, a mere 
incident to other callings. 
A third lesson of American experience of incalculable value to the 
Latin-American Republics is the necessity of giving greater attention 
to the education of women. In spite of superficial indications to the 
contrary, there is no other portion of the world where the influence of 
women is as far-reaching. In many respects it is greater than in the 
United States, owing to the fact that in the Latin-American countries 
the training of children is left almost exclusively to the mother. That 
fellowship and companionship between father and sons so character- 
istic of family life in the United States is almost totally lacking. 
The mother’s directing influence is almost if not quite exclusive. It 
is only when the sons have reached an age at which it becomes neces-
-P-A-G-E-339
  EDUCATION IN ARGENTINA AND CHILE. S20 
sary to choose a profession or calling that the father’s authority 
becomes prominent. 
The surface appearances of Latin-American society are most mis- 
leading in this respect. As soon as one becomes acquainted with 
family organization and customs, the tremendous influence of the wife 
and mother immediately becomes apparent. The tendency to keep the 
young woman as far removed as possible from contact with real life, 
the atmosphere of artificiality with which she is surrounded, together 
with the inadequate and in many respects superficial education which 
she receives, react unfavorably on the character and stability of 
Latin-American society. The young woman enters upon the duties 
of wifehood and motherhood with either a false or totally inadequate 
idea of social and economic conditions. An exaggerated spirit of in- 
dulgence toward children, an acceptance almost without question of the 
idea that the sons must sow their wild oats, and the consequent lack of 
discipline which this involves, tend to develop a generation but poorly 
equipped with the qualities of self-control, determination, and con- 
tinuous application so necessary to the development of a vigorous race. 
Furthermore, the idea of preparing young women of the middle 
class to earn their livelihood is but beginning to find acceptance in the 
countries of Latin-America. A start in this direction has been made 
in several countries, but even where, as in the Argentine Republic, a 
special commercial school has been opened for women, both the course 
of study and the type of training are Pacnesly inferior to those given 
in schools for male pupils. 
It is true that there still exists throughout Latin-America a strong 
social prejudice against the entry of young women into commercial 
and industrial pursuits. This fact makes it all the more important 
that the best facilities be offered to the comparatively small group 
prepared to weather this social tradition. No more important influ- 
ence can be set at work to overcome a prejudice which is a real 
obstacle to national progress. 
Tt is not possible, within the limits of this report, to present a 
detailed account of the educational systems of the Latin-American 
Republics. We must, therefore, content ourselves with a brief de- 
scription of the leading traits of those countries which we have had 
the opportunity to study with some detail—viz, the Argentine Repub- 
lic and Chile. 
THE ARGENTINE REPUBLIC. 
The impulse given to public education under the presidency of 
Sarmiento assured the Argentine Republic a position of leadership 
in educational matters among the South American Republics. Al- 
though much has been accomplished since that time, both in the  
-P-A-G-E-340
328 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
extension of the system and in the improvement of methods, it can not 
be said that the Argentine Republic has maintained that position of 
undisputed leadership in South American educational matters which 
it once occupied. The most serious obstacles to progress have been: 
First. The poverty of the Provinces, upon which the responsibility 
for primary education was placed-under the constitution of 1853, 
and— 
Second. The lack of stability in the educational policy of the 
Federal Government in the development of the system of secondary 
instruction. The technical direction of this branch of the educa- 
tional system has suffered severely from the uncertainties of political 
changes. Continuity of policy has been quite impossible. Each 
incoming minister of public instruction has attempted to leave his 
impress upon the system of secondary instruction by incorporating 
his personal views into the curriculum. Both the method and the 
content of instruction have suffered from this lack of stability and 
expert direction. It is only within the past two years that the neces- 
sity of divorcing the technical direction of the system from the con- 
flicts of party politics has become apparent. The present minister 
of public instruction has recognized the importance of such stability 
by giving wider powers to the inspector of secondary instruction, 
who should be made in fact as well as in law the technical head of 
the system. 
The Argentine educational system is divided into four distinct 
parts: 
First. The elementary schools, for which the provincial govern- 
ments are primarily responsible, but for the maintenance of which the 
Federal Government has been compelled to make large expenditures. 
Second. The secondary schools, known as “ liceos ” and “colegios,” 
and in which should also be included the normal schools, which are 
established, maintained, and controlled by the federal authorities, 
although the provincial governments may and in some cases have 
established institutions of the same grade. 
Third. Commercial, industrial, and other special schools, which 
are, as a rule, established and supported by the National Government, 
but which may also be established by the provincial authorities. 
Fourth. The three national universities, Cordoba, Buenos Aires, 
and La Plata, established and supported by the National Government. 
PRIMARY INSTRUCTION. 
The Argentine Constitution places upon the Provinces the obliga- 
tion of maintaining a system of primary instruction. This obligation 
has been but partially fulfilled, owing in part to the lack of resources 
of the Provinces and in part to the absence of an organized public
-P-A-G-E-341
EDUCATION IN THE ARGENTINE REPUBLIC. 329 
opinion demanding the expenditure of a certain minimum of the 
public revenues on education. The failure of the Provinces to meet 
their obligations has made it necessary for the Federal Govern- 
ment to give the broadest possible interpretation to its constitutional 
powers; otherwise a large percentage of the people of the country 
would be deprived of all educational facilities. 
In cooperating with the Provinces for the development of the 
primary-school system the Federal Government has acquired consid- 
erable control over this branch of the educational system. Wherever 
such schools are maintained by national funds, the federal authorities 
reserve control both over the curriculum and the personnel.* 
The Central Government, furthermore, maintains complete control 
over primary education in the federal capital, Buenos Aires, and in 
the national Territories. This control is exercised by a salaried 
national council of education (Consejo Nacional de Educacién) 
appointed by the President of the Republic. During the fiscal year 
1907 this council expended $4,212,419 for the establishment and main- 
tenance of primary schools in the federal capital, in the national 
Territories, and for the primary schools in the Provinces supported 
by federal funds.’ 
With the gradual awakening of national opinion to the dangers 
incident to an inadequate system of primary instruction there is 
evident an increasing tendency to look to the Federal Government for 
the solution of this problem. The startling figures published by the 
superior council of education have given great. impetus to the move- 
ment to nationalize the system of primary instruction. The present 
minister of public instruction has made this an integral part of his 
reform platform, and is convinced that there are no constitutional 
obstacles to the enforcement of the plan. His position has been 
greatly strengthened by the recent publication of data which give 
a graphic picture of the backward condition of primary education 
in the Argentine Republic. These figures, which are submitted in an 
accompanying table, will be supplemented by a school census now in 
progress, the detailed results of which will probably be available 
toward the close of this year or early in 1910.   
«During the first nine months of 1908 the federal subsidies for primary instruction in 
the Provinces amounted to $548,359.57. The total for the year will amount to over 
$1,000,000.

332 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
The course of primary instruction includes six grades, each requir- 
ing one year. This portion of the educational system, especially in 
the city of Buenos Aires, is well organized. Modern pedagogical 
methods have been introduced, and a concerted effort is being made 
to supply these schools with the best of material. The great need at 
present is the extension of primary school facilities to a-larger per- 
centage of the population. For this purpose the provincial govern- 
ments will be compelled sooner. or later to secure larger revenues 
through taxation. At present real estate bears an altogether inade- 
quate share of the burden of taxation. A considerable increase in the 
rate for the support and extension of primary education is the most 
important problem facing the Provinces. Unfortunately, there exists 
powerful opposition to this step, but it is to be hoped that the constant 
agitation of local educational associations will gradually arouse the 
taxpayers to the necessity of greater sacrifice for the public welfare. 
THE SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
Secondary education in the Argentine Republic is controlled and 
maintained by the Central Government. The institutions for this 
grade of education are known as “ colegios,” ¢ distributed as follows:

The course of instruction covers a period of five years and the cur- 
riculum is arranged with special reference to the needs of those 
intending to follow professional careers. In fact, it may be said that 
only those intending to follow such callings attend the “ colegios.” 
«The institutions fan women are designated “ liceos.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-345
    EDUCATION IN THE ARGENTINE REPUBLIC. 833 
The student usually enters these institutions at the age of 12 and 
is prepared for one of the university professional schools at 17. 
The instability of the curriculum of these institutions has been one 
of the most serious obstacles to their development. Every. minister 
of public instruction, without exception, has undertaken to make some 
fundamental changes. The teaching corps has not been given op- 
portunity to become thoroughly acquainted with any one course of 
study. This has reacted most unfavorably on the method of teaching 
as well as on the preparation of the teachers for their work. While 
it is important that the course of study be constantly adjusted to 
new needs, it is far more important that the teachers be thoroughly 
acquainted both with the plan of study and with the content of the 
subject entrusted to their care. 
This lack of stability has also increased the difficulties of edu- 
cational control. Complaints against incompetent teachers are met 
with the excuse that the constant changes in the curriculum have 
made it impossible to develop a well-organized pedagogical plan. 
The Federal Government is making every effort to place these 
schools on a high plane of efficiency. Splendid buildings are being 
erected in the larger provincial towns and the most modern equip- 
ment is being provided. The greatest obstacle to the full develop- 
ment of these institutions has been the difficulty of securing carefully 
trained teachers. The organization and method of recruiting the 
members of the faculty have contributed largely to this end. The 
subjects of instruction are divided into “ catedras,” or “ chairs,” each 
“ chair ” including a minimum of three hours of instruction per week. 
For each “ catedra” the incumbent receives about $130 per month. 
Instead of training men especially for these positions, the unfortunate 
plan has been adopted, especially in the smaller towns, of dividing 
the “catedras” amongst the resident and practicing lawyers and 
physicians. It is not infrequent to find a physician teaching litera- 
ture or a lawyer giving a course in physics. The most serious defect 
of this plan is that these teaching positions are regarded as merely 
incidental to the incumbent’s main professional work, a means of 
adding to his personal income without considerable effort. The result 
is that these schools lack a permanent professional teaching staff in 
close personal touch with the pupils. 
Another danger to which every minister of public instruction is 
subjected is the tremendous pressure for appointments to teaching 
positions in these schools. Inasmuch as there is no special pedagogical 
preparation requisite for such appointments, political leaders are 
besieged with applications, and soon find themselves unable to with- 
stand the pressure. 
The work in the “ colegios ” would also be much improved through 
greater elasticity, combined with greater simplicity of the curriculum.

The examination of this curriculum discloses a tendency to place 
in the secondary schools advanced subjects such as psychology 
and philosophy, which should be reserved for the universities. Fur- 
thermore, all pupils are required to take three languages—French, 
English, and Italian. The result is that they acquire a smattering 
of each and a thorough acquaintance with none. A far better plan 
would be to allow each pupil the selection of one, or at most two, lan- 
guages and concentrate effort on these. Under the most favorable 
circumstances it is extremely difficult to teach languages in the large 
classes of a public school. When, therefore, the attempt is made to 
teach three languages in a curriculum which contains from eight to 
twelve subjects, the result of such overcrowding can readily be 
foreseen. 
This evil can be remedied through the introduction of the elective 
system, permitting each pupil, at the beginning of the third year, 
to select the subjects in which he is most interested, and which will 
best prepare him for the professional studies upon which he enters 
immediately after leaving the “ colegio.” 
The description of secondary education would be incomplete with- 
out some reference to the large number of Catholic “ colegios” under 
the direction of the religious orders—Jesuits, Redemptionists, ete. It 
is to these schools that the sons of the leading families are sent. The 
State exercises some control, but this control is quite inadequate. The 
important position occupied by private schools is evident from the 
fact that in the city of Buenos Aires there are at the present time 450 
private as compared with 190 public schools. 
The secondary schools for women are known as “ liceos.” Of these 
here are but two at present in the Argentine Republic, one in Buenos 
ires and the other in La Plata. Their curriculum is even more over-
-P-A-G-E-348
336 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
burdened, for to all the studies of the “ colegios” music and domestic 
science have been added. 
The fact that there are but two such schools in the Republic indi- 
cates that the State has but begun to face the problem of secondary 
education for women. Heretofore the convents and other Catholic 
schools have enjoyed practically exclusive control over this important 
branch of the educational system. It is true that girls are admitted 
to the “colegios” on an equal footing with boys, but the prejudice 
against coeducation is still so great that but few girls attend these 
institutions. 
NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
Upon this branch of the Argentine system American methods have 
exerted a real influence. The country owes the first normal school 
organized in accordance with modern pedagogical standards to the 
efforts of a group of American teachers brought to the Argentine 
Republic by President Sarmiento for the normal school in the city of 
Parana, the capital of the Province of Entre Rios. The influence of 
this school has been felt throughout the educational system of the 
country, and has contributed in no small measure toward placing the 
normal schools of the Argentine Republic upon their present plane 
of efficiency. 
There are at present 35 normal schools in the Argentine Republic,

This curriculum is open to the same criticism of overcrowding as 
the course of study in the “ colegios nacionales.” This is a defect, 
however, which can be readily remedied. On the other hand, there 
is noticeable within recent years a healthful tendency to give a more 
important place to the study of Argentine history, and to the eco- 
nomic, social, and political development of the country. This change 
is certain to exert an excellent influence upon the method and content 
of instruction in the primary schools. 
SCHOOLS OF COMMERCE. 
Commercial education is still in its infancy in the Argentine Re- 
public as in all other sections of South America. Buenos Aires has 
three such schools (two for men and one for women), Bahia Blanca 
one, Rosario one, and Concordia one. | 
The courses offered are in the main elementary, similar in many 
respects to the curriculum of our so-called “ business colleges.” The 
course for men covers four years, that for women three years. An 
effort is now being made to give to women the same training as to
-P-A-G-E-351
EDUCATION IN THE ARGENTINE REPUBLIC. 339 
men, but this plan has encountered considerable opposition owing to 
the fear of possible competition. 
Higher commercial education as a distinct branch of university 
training, which now occupies so important a position in the United 
States, has not as yet found acceptance either in the Argentine Re- 
public or in any other South American country. Nevertheless, the 
schools of commerce, as at present organized, are doing excellent 
service both in their day and night courses. There is, however, great 
need of a clearer appreciation, on the part of the educational authori- 
ties, of the importance of these institutions and the necessity of devot- 
ing a larger portion of the educational budget to their development. 
It would, in fact, be desirable to introduce into the “colegios” a 
special commercial course, giving to pupils the choice between this 
course and that leading to law, medicine, or engineering. In this 
way commercial education would be placed upon a distinctly higher 
plane, attract a better class of students, and tend to relieve the pres- 
sure in the overcrowded professions. 
INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION. 
Although a start has been made in this direction, it may still be said 
that the Argentine authorities have but begun to appreciate the in- 
timate relation between this type of education and national progress. 
The educational ideals which dominate the Argentine system are 
still largely humanistic. Spanish traditions and Spanish training 
have for many years obscured the essential dignity of manual labor. 
At present there are but two public industrial schools for boys, one 
in Buenos Aires and the other in Rosario. There are, in addition, a 
considerable number of private industrial schools, notably the school 
founded in Buenos Aires by the Association for Industrial Education. 
Of the two public industrial schools above mentioned, the national 
institution in Buenos Aires, for which a new building has been 
constructed recently, deserves special mention. Both as regards 
equipment and method of instruction it is admirably organized and 
is rendering splendid service to the country. Pupils enter this school 
after having completed four years of primary instruction. The 
course extends over six years, two years preparatory work, two years 
of general instruction, and two years of specialized instruction lead- 
ing to the following trades: (1) Master mechanic, (2) builder, and 
(8) industrial chemist. 
The success of the two schools established by the National Govern- 
ment indicates the direction in which effort should now be concen- 
trated. The country requires the multiplication of such schools to a 
far greater degree than the “colegios.” If the educational system of 
   
-P-A-G-E-352
    340 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
the country is to be symmetrically developed, national industrial 
schools must be established in every provincial capital. 
The industrial schools for girls are known as “escuelas pro- 
fesionales,” and are rather in the nature of trade schools. There 
are four such schools supported by the National Government, three 
in Buenos Aires, and one in Cordoba. 
SPECIAL SECONDARY SCHOOLS, 
In addition to the secondary schools above enumerated there are 
a number of special schools which deserve mention, such as the 
National Institute for Secondary Teachers, the National Academy of 
Fine Arts, the Normal Institute for Physical Culture, all in the city 
of Buenos Aires, and the National Institute of Chemistry, situated in 
San Juan, the capital of the Province of the same name. 
THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITIES. 
Of the three national universities, the oldest is the University of 
Cordoba, founded nearly three centuries ago. In fact, it is the second 
oldest university on the American Continent, having been founded in 
1609, fifty-eight years after the University of San Marcos, of Lima, 
eerste : 
The other two universities, Buenos Aires and La Plata, are com- 
paratively recent foundations, the latter having been established but 
four years ago. 
These institutions are maintained exclusively by federal appropria- 
tions. There are no tuition fees and the matriculation and graduation 
fees are very low. For the year 1908 the appropriations for the 
maintenance of these institutions were as follows: University of 
Sordoba, $276,825; University of Buenos Aires, $449,350; University 
of La Plata, $430,000. 
University organization in the Argentine Republic resembles more 
closely the French than the American system. The faculties are to 
a very considerable extent independent of one another. It is true 
that each university has its president, but with the exception of the 
University of La Plata this office does not carry with it anything 
approaching the powers of a university president of the United 
States. 
The absence of coordination and cooperation amongst the several 
faculties has been one of the fundamental weaknesses in the develop- 
ment of university influence in the Argentine Republic. It was with 
a view to remedying this defect that a different system was adopted 
in the organization of the National University of La Plata, estab- 
lished but four years ago. American university organization was used 
as a model after which the new institution was patterned. _ Instead of
-P-A-G-E-353
  EDUCATION IN CHILE. 841 
making the president a mere figurehead he was vested with supervi- 
sory powers over all the faculties. The result has been a unity of 
university effort which neither of the older institutions has been able 
to attain. 
In each of the three universities there is a faculty of law, a faculty 
of philosophy and letters, a faculty of natural sciences, and a faculty 
of physical and mathematical sciences. Cordoba and Buenos Aires 
have also a medical faculty. 
The material equipment of all the professional schools, especially 
the medical school of the University of Buenos Aires, is excellent. 
Instruction in all the faculties, however, suffers severely from the 
lack of contact between student and professor. Most of the members 
of the instructing corps—and this is particularly true of the law 
faculties—interpret their duties narrowly, confining themselves to 
formal lectures, with examinations at stated periods. Thus the edu- 
cational value of close contact between student and professor, upon 
which so much stress is laid in the United States, is entirely lost. 
Too much stress is laid on the final examination tests, whereas the 
work of the student during the college year is almost totally neglected. 
In this respect, also, the policy of the National University of La 
Plata, under the wise guidance of its present president and vice- 
president, marks a distinct step in advance. Students are required 
to keep their work at a certain standard of efficiency, professors are 
encouraged, in fact required, to enter into close touch with their 
students. The result is that there is gradually developing an esprit 
de corps which is having a most salutary influence on the growth 
of this institution. 
The National Government has been most liberal with its three 
universities, especially within recent years. Plans have been matured 
for magnificent new buildings for the faculty of physical and mathe- 
matical science (which includes engineering) of the University of 
Buenos Aires; a great new hospital costing $6,000,000 is to be erected 
as an adjunct to the medical school. Cordoba is to have a series of 
new buildings to commemorate her tercentenary. 
CHILE. 
Educational progress in Chile presents a striking contrast with the 
Argentine Republic. In the Argentine Republic the democratic 
development of the country since 1850 led to the early development of 
primary education. Secondary and university instruction received 
but little attention. It is true that the Argentine educational system 
remained in a primitive state until the presidency of Sarmiento. 
Nevertheless, even up to his time more attention was given to primary 
 
-P-A-G-E-354
  842 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
than to secondary schools. The aristocratic social organization of 
Chile, on the other hand, led to the concentration of effort on the 
development of the secondary schools. As a result, Chile posseses 
the best “liceos” and “institutos” in South America. Unfortu- 
nately, the system of.primary education was neglected for many 
years and resulted in a degree of illiteracy amongst the masses which 
made impassable the chasm between social classes. The country is 
now suffering from the results of this long-continued neglect. With 
the industrial progress of the'country the economic condition of the 
laboring classes has been steadily improving, but owing to their 
ignorant condition and total lack of preparation, the higher wages 
have in many cases resulted in degeneration rather than progress. 
The primitive wants of the agricultural laborers were satisfied by 
the lower wage, and the surplus has been used, to a very considerable 
extent, in an increased indulgence in spirituous liquors. Saving is 
almost unknown to the Chilean laborer, so that the increased wages 
have not led to a more careful provision for the future of the family. 
On the other hand the increased wages, in bettering the situation 
of the laborer, has also given rise to a spirit of discontent, a desire 
for a larger share in production. The ignorance of the laborer 
makes him an easy prey to demagogic agitation. It is not surprising, 
therefore, to find the violent outbreaks of discontented laborers which 
have occurred from time to time within late years, and of which 
the most recent instance was the strike of the nitrate workers in 
Iquique, which led to the mowing down of 500 men and women with 
the machine guns of the troops. 
The problem of overwhelming importance now confronting Chile 
is the improvement and extension of the system of primary education. 
It is only through the education of the masses and the consequent 
bridging over of the tremendous chasm that now separates the 
wealthy and educated from the uneducated and poorer classes that 
Chile will be able to retard the growth of discontent. 
Her leading statesmen are fully alive to the dangers of the present 
situation, and it is most gratifying to find the concentration of effort 
in the last few years on the development of the system of primary 
education. Rapid progress is now being made, although the decline 
in national income, due to the economic crisis through which the 
country has been passing, has given a temporary setback to the 
movement. ; 
PRIMARY EDUCATION. 
The Chilean educational system in all its branches is national in 
scope and organization, that is to say, is maintained by the national 
treasury. No local taxes are levied for educational purposes and the
-P-A-G-E-355
  EDUCATION IN CHILE. 843 
local authorities have no voice in the administration of or control 
over the system. 
Although this lack of local cooperation in the development of the 
educational system has been unfortunate in many respects, it was 
inevitable in the absence of a well-defined public opinion upon which 
a local system might depend. 
In marked contrast with the Argentine system, the organization of 
primary education in Chile is highly centralized. Teachers are ap- 
pointed and paid by the Central Government and central supervision 
is maintained over every detail of educational organization. While 
subject to the final authority of the President of the Republic and 
the minister of public instruction, the direct control over the system 
of primary instruction is exercised by an inspector-general. 
It is a curious fact worthy of note, for it throws an interesting side 
light on Chilean social conditions, that the secondary schools, or 
“liceos,” have gradually invaded the field of the primary school 
through the establishment of preparatory courses. These institutions 
depend upon a totally different educational authority—the council of 
public instruction and the president of the University of Chile. 
The preparatory courses of the “liceos” are attended by the sons 
of the well-to-do families, whereas the regular primary courses are 
attended by the poorer element of the population. Thus, in fact, 
two systems of primary education exist side by side, dependent upon 
different educational authorities and attracting totally different 
classes of the population. For this reason the primary schools have 
not contributed as much as might be expected toward breaking down 
the class barriers so marked in Chilean society. 
During the past fifteen years the leading statesmen of Chile have 
realized that this neglect of primary instruction is a real menace to 
the stability and orderly development of the country. The social 
organization of Chile is still fundamentally aristocratic. Until 
comparatively recent times the bulk of the population, especially the 
agricultural laborers, were in a condition of peonage. The industrial 
advance of the country, together with the rising wage scale, has pro- 
duced in the laboring classes a consciousness of power. The illiteracy 
of the great mass of the laboring classes greatly increases the dangers 
of the situation. The extension of primary instruction has therefore 
become one of the conditions prerequisite to orderly national advance. 
The country must now prepare itself to make every sacrifice for this 
purpose.  
-P-A-G-E-356

During the past sixteen years the primary-school facilities have 
increased as follows:

  From this table it will be seen that the attendance in 1907 shows an 
increase of 15,675 over 1906. 
The curriculum of the primary schools in Chile is considerably less 
overburdened than in the Argentine Republic. The system has, 
furthermore, been considerably improved by the introduction of 
manual training in 1899. This was begun on a small scale in 10 
schools, and has gradually been extended until in 1907 there were 
120 workshops installed in as many public schools. In all the girls’ 
schools sewing has been made an integral part of the curriculum. A 
new plan which is about to be put into operation is to permit pupils 
to devoté the last of the six years of primary instruction to special 
training in the mechanic arts. 
NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
In the Chilean system the normal schools and the primary schools 
are dependent upon the same educational authority—the inspector- 
general of education. There are at present 15 normal schools—6 for 
men and 9 for women. 
Owing to the low salaries paid to primary-school teachers, the 
normal schools are neither as numerous nor as largely attended as the 
educational needs of the country require. In 1907, it is true, salaries 
were considerably increased,‘ but considering the high cost of living 
in Chile, the salaries are still far too low. Calculating the “ peso” at

After ten years of service the teacher is entitled to an increase of 
20 per cent. 
In the 9 normal schools for women the matriculation in 1907 was 
1,255, with an average attendance of 1,029; in the 6 normal schools 
for men the matriculation was 722, with an average attendance 
of 580. 
SECONDARY SCHOOLS, 
The secondary schools, or “ liceos ” as they are called, are under the 
control of a national council of education appointed by the Presi- 
dent of the Republic, of which the president of the national university 
is a member ex officio. 
There are in all 39 such establishments for boys and 30 for girls, 
each with its respective preparatory course.* 
The matriculation and attendance are as follows:

The development of secondary schools for girls has been extraor- 
dinarily rapid considering the fact that no attention was paid to this 
branch of the system until 1877. 
Although technically classed as a part of the national university, 
the pedagogical institute may best be considered in connection with 
the system of secondary instruction, for it is in this institute that 
teachers for the “liceos” are trained. Founded twenty years ago, 
this institute was at first intended exclusively for male pupils, but 
was later on made coeducational. During this time 310 secondary 
school teachers have been graduated. The number of students has 
increased rapidly. In 1907 there were 205 students registered. 
  
@The Internado Barros Arana for boys (Santiago) and Liceos Nos. 4 and 5 for girls 
(Santiago) have no preparatory courses.  
-P-A-G-E-358
  346 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
The curriculum of the Instituto Pedagégico is planned to prepare 
specialists. It is therefore divided into seven distinct sections: (1) 
Spanish, (2) French, (8) English, (4) German, (5) history and 
geography, (6) mathematics and physics, (7) biology, chemistry, and 
mineralogy. 
All students are required to take pedagogy, experimental psychol- 
ogy, logic, ethics, the history of philosophy, civics, and educational 
organization and legislation. The full course covers a period of four 
years. 
The plan of study in this institution, as well as the method of in- 
struction, are distinctively German. In fact, the entire faculty, with 
the exception of the director, has been recruited from the German sec- 
ondary schools. This is probably the best instance of that quiet and 
unpretentious extension of German intellectual influence which is 
far more significant than her commercial advance. The German 
Government has been deeply interested in meeting every request of 
the Chilean people for competent teachers. At comparatively mod- 
erate salaries Chile has secured from Germany a group of teachers 
who now dominate the system of secondary education, and their in- 
fluence is also being felt throughout the system of primary instruction. 
This readiness of Germany to be of service contains a lesson of much 
importance to the United States. There has been no lack of requests 
on the part of the Latin-American governments for American teach- 
ers, but there has been considerable difficulty in meeting these re- 
quests, owing in part to the question of language, but mainly to the 
lack of adaptability of the average American teacher. Germany is 
performing a great service to the countries of Latin America—the 
kind of service that establishes her influence far more effectively 
than any attempt at extension of dominion. 
SPECIAL AND TECHNICAL SCHOOLS. 
Commercial education is still in its infancy in Chile. As a result 
of long-continued agitation on the part of a group of public-spirited 
citizens, an excellent commercial school was established in Santiago 
in 1898. Its success has been such that an appropriation was secured 
from the national government for a new building. Similar schools, 
but on a more modest scale, have been established in Valparaiso, 
Vallenar, Iquique, Coquimbo, Talca, Concepcién, Antofagasta, and 
San Carlos. 
The total registration at these schools in 1906 was 1,453, with an 
average attendance of 1,080. The total outlay for the year was nearly 
$100,000. 
 
-P-A-G-E-359
EDUCATION IN CHILE. 847 
The entrance requirements to these schools are the same as for the 
“Ticeos,” and the regular course covers a period of three years. In 
addition, there are special courses of two years for clerks and ac- 
countants. Although the first steps toward the development of a 
system of commercial education have been taken, the idea of higher 
commercial education has as yet made but little headway. 
The present commercial courses are, in the main, of an elementary 
character. The students enter at the age of 12 and usually leave at 
14 or 15. The further development of the system is a matter of as 
much importance to Chile as to the Argentine Republic. On all 
sides one hears complaints of the unwillingness of the sons of the 
better families to enter upon business careers. Higher commercial 
education will tend to counteract the tendency toward the overcrowd- 
ing of the professions. 
INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION. 
In the school of mechanic arts, situated at Santiago, an important 
step has been taken toward the establishment of a comprehensive 
system of industrial education. To this great school pupils from all 
parts of the country are sent. The courses are eminently practical 
and the training thorough. The great service performed by this 
school indicates the necessity of establishing similar institutions in 
all the larger towns of the republic. In fact, it may be said of Chile, 
as of all the other countries of South America, that the educational 
problem of overshadowing importance at the present time is the 
extension of industrial education and technical instruction. This 
necessity is due in part to the fact that the present scholastic system 
directs far too large a proportion of the young men into the study 
of law and medicine. 
A beginning has been made in Santiago. toward the establishment 
of industrial training for girls. As yet the industrial opportunities 
for women are exceedingly limited. The Santiago school has, there- 
fore, confined its attention to the training of young women for dress- 
makers, hatmakers, and the minor commercial positions. The in- 
dustrial emancipation of women is, however, a most important factor 
in the social progress of the country, and it is through schools such 
as these that this emancipation will be effected. 
PRIVATE SCHOOLS. 
The description of the school system of Chile would be incomplete 
without some reference to the large number of private schools of both 
primary and secondary grade. Many of these are subsidized by the 
Government, others are maintained by the Catholic Church or by   
 
-P-A-G-E-360

private associations. The number of private primary schools is indi-

During the same year (1906) the Government granted subsidies~

JNIVERSITY INSTRUCTION. 
University instruction has been more fully developed than any 
other portion of the educational system. The council of public in- 
struction, under whose immediate charge the university is placed, 
has wielded great influence, and has always been able to secure rela- 
tively large appropriations for university instruction. 'The admin- 
istrative head of the university is the president, or “rector,” as he 
is called, who is at the same time ex officio member of the council 
of public instruction. 
At the present time the university offers courses in law and polit- 
ical science, medicine, pharmacy, dentistry, engineering, architecture, 
and fine arts. The pedagogical institute also forms an integral part 
of the university organization. The teaching corps, number of 
students, and budget are indicated in the following table:

  EDUCATION IN CHILE. 349 
University instruction in Chile suffers from the serious defect of 
an overemphasis—in fact, almost complete dependence—upon exami- 
nations as a means of controlling the work of the students. There is 
little or no contact between student and professor, and as a rule the 
student interprets his university life as a series of lectures, followed 
by examinations. The result is a lack of distinctive student life, 
which is the most serious obstacle to the development of the broadest 
university influence. 
Dr. Valentin Letelier, who was until recently rector, made a strenu- 
ous effort to remedy this defect. He impressed on the students the 
essential unity of university life and the necessity of closer coopera- 
tion amongst the students of the different departments. Probably 
the most important step taken has been the establishment of a student 
center, or club house, adjoining the university building. Doctor 
Letelier is keenly alive to the necessity of developing a distinctive 
university life which will include the entire student body. He has 
done a service to higher education in Chile the value of which will 
only be fully realized by future generations. 
One of the most important changes which the present situation 
calls for is the recognition of membership in a university faculty as a 
distinctive career, commanding and demanding all the time and 
attention of the incumbent. At present a university professorship in 
Chile is looked upon in much the same way as in the Argentine 
Republic—a mere incidental activity to current professional activities. 
The result is a lack of esprit de corps, which has been a serious obstacle 
to the advance of higher education in Chile. 
The description of higher education would be incomplete without 
some reference to the Catholic University situated in Santiago, which 
offers courses in law, civil and mining engineering, architecture, fine 
arts, and agriculture. The law school has 185 students; the engineer- 
ing school, 396; the agricultural school, 12; and the school of fine arts, 
55. In all of these departments the equipment is excellent, and the 
teaching corps has been selected with great care. 
The Catholic University occupies an unique position. Its main 
supporters are the members of the conservative party. Inasmuch 
as the wealthier elements of Chilean society are to a very large ex- 
tent affiliated with this party, the donations and bequests reach a large 
total each year. In fact, this is one of the few instances in Latin 
America in which a great national institution is supported exclusively 
by private contributions. The rivalry existing between the national 
and the Catholic universities has proved of real benefit to both, pro- 
tecting them against the stagnation and fossilization which is the 
inevitable consequence of monopoly.

Education during the Colonial epoch.—The conquest and colonization of 
Spanish America were effected at a time when the divine right of kings was 
an unquestioned fundamental dogma of the political creed of European nations. 
The principal object of all the laws relating to the Spanish colonies and their 
institutions was to maintain the new lands and peoples under the temporal 
and, to a certain extent, under the ecclesiastical dominion of the Catholic King. 
Theoretically, the supreme object of the conquest and of the maintenance of 
sovereignty over the subjugated Indians was their conversion to Christianity 
and the salvation of their souls. It was attempted, first of all, to create a new 
Catholic population under the double authority of the Spanish Crown and the 
pontificate. 
What with its incessant wars of religion, in the expulsion of the Arabs and 
Jews, and in the extirpation of heresy, the mother country found itself at the 
time of the conquest, in the sixteenth century, in a precarious situation, 
both economical and industrial. Its necessities kept on increasing, while its 
resources diminished. Under such circumstances the eagerness with which the 
Royal Government, and private individuals as well, sought the riches of the 
New World can be readily understood. The monopolistic system which was then 
established, which now seems to us so unjust, was imposed upon the Govern- 
ment by the fatality of history. America being regarded as an immense trad- 
ing station, the army, the civil officers of the Government, and the commercial 
houses all concerned themselves but little with the intellectual culture of the 
new colonies. It might even be said that the ignorance of the natives and of 
the creoles was regarded as a favorable circumstance for keeping the colonies 
submissive under the severe political and economical regimen to which they 
were subjected. Yet, aside from its lofty ideal of evangelizing the Indians, it 
was also for the interest of the Crown to educate the creoles, if not from the 
ampler and more generous point of view of providing them with superior cul- 
ture, at any rate from the selfish motive of educating them in political and 
religious obedience, so as to keep them more easily under the yoke.

EDUCATION IN ARGENTINA AND CHILE. 851 
The prevailing ideas of the epoch and especially the unequivocal support of 
the church sanctioned these political views of the Spanish monarchy, and in 
consequence colonial education assumed a pronounced religious character. 
The papacy and the King in Europe, and the regular and secular clergy in 
America, supported by the Spanish officials, were the factors of all education 
during the Spanish domination. 
The priests and missionaries who accompanied the conquerors, inflamed with 
apostolic zeal, devoted themselves ardently to the conversion of the natives, 
and after the conquest was assured and Spanish settlements were established 
they opened their cloisters for the education of the creoles. Still later they 
took measures to form a local clergy in the colonies which should be graduated 
from universities like those in the Catholic countries of Europe. The Crown 
favored this initiative of the church, which was undertaken especially by the 
missionary orders, by the Jesuits above all, but also by Franciscans and 
Dominicans. <A series of statutes and decrees was promulgated by the council 
of the Indies in which the system of education founded by the clergy was 
approved and fostered, and regulations were formulated for its government. 
The King, in virtue of his right of patronship, constituted himself the supreme 
head of religious instruction, although he respected the autonomy of the 
establishments and institutions conducted by the clergy. The apostolic appro- 
bation of the Pope was always sought in founding universities. 
The Laws of the Indies contain the royal decrees relating to what would 
now be called public instruction. 
There was no methodical plan, but some form of instruction was instituted 
in each locality according to its condition and resources. The classical forms 
of the teaching bodies of the middle ages, which required that the instruction 
should be strictly dogmatic in its character, were recognized in these decrees, 
In such distant lands and among such a wild and turbulent mixed population 
as they contained a severe discipline in habits of obedience to the Crown 
and church was indispensable. The Government therefore, always fearful of 
insubordination, reenforced by its authority the educational system based upon 
dogmatism and obedience which the Jesuits had already established in Spain 
and in nearly all the Catholic world. 
The Government’s first case was to see that the sons of caciques who would 
have to govern the Indians should be taught the holy Catholic faith. Colleges 
were established for this purpose in the different colonies, in which the children 
were placed under the care of priests, who taught them good manners and the 
Spanish language, and who later opened schools for all Indian children for 
instruction in the gospel, where they learned reading and writing besides the 
catechism. Among the ecclesiastical institutions which took charge of the 
education of the Indians the best organized and most important were those 
called “reducciones,” which were institutions conducted by the Jesuits where 
converted Indians were formed into docile colonies of agricultural laborers, 
whose daily routine was minutely prescribed for them by their religious masters. 
These institutions, which were established in the early colonial period, reached 
a high degree of development in the seventeenth century, but when the priests 
were expelled by King Carlos III at the close of the eighteenth century, the 
Indians, being deprived of their teachings, soon relapsed into their natural 
condition of savagery, thus showing themselves incapable of profiting, unsus- 
tained, by the Catholic culture they had been accustomed to receive. Primary 
instruction—reading, writing, and religion—was provided for in the mission 
schools and certain small colleges. What would now be called secondary and 
superior instruction was given in the universities, The colonial universities
-P-A-G-E-364
  
  352 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
may be divided into two classes—the official institutions, which were founded 
by the Crown, like those of Lima and Mexico, and the private institutions, 
which were established by the regular or secular clergy, were then authorized 
by the Pope, and were recognized by the Crown through concessions which were 
prolonged indefinitely. “The University of Cordova belongs to this last category. 
It was the highest and most typical exponent of the colonial culture of Para- 
guay, Tucuman, Buenos Aires, and the Banda Oriental of Uruguay, which 
together constituted in the later period of Spanish rule the large and rich vice- 
royalty of Rio de la Plata. 
The universities, like the lower schools, grew up under the shadow of the 
church. They were, to a certain extent, autonomous and of a pronounced eccle- 
siastical character, while the Crown regulated their minutest affairs by royal 
decrees. The viceroys could not intervene in the selection of rectors or pro- 
fessors or in the granting of decrees. The former, elected by the body of gradu- 
ates, held office for one year, but were eligible for reelection. The professors 
were of two categories, those who held their positions during good behavior and 
those whose terms lasted four years. The instruction was of a pronounced 
theological character. The principal object of the universities was to graduate 
a creole clergy who should keep the principle of the divine right of kings alive 
and strong in the colonies. 
LT, 
Education of the Indians.—As was remarked above, theoretically the lofty 
aim of the Spanish conquest of America was the conversion of the Indians. 
But this ideal did not attain the desired result. The Indians did not mix 
freely with the Europeans and always remained, at bottom, essentially anti- 
Christian. The task of the evangelizers encountered an insuperable obstacle 
in human nature itself. For notwithstanding that Christianity proclaims the 
equality of mankind, modern biological theories are far from regarding this 
equality as absolute or even evident. History records the fatal disappearance 
or submergence of inferior races before their conquerors, their remnants ap- 
pearing as castes or slaves. Force was always the predominating element in 
conquest, while persuasion played a secondary part. The contrast between the 
barbarism of most of the American Indians, outside of Mexico and Peru, and 
the civilization of the Spaniards was too great, added to thé radical difference 
of race, to be easily obliterated, so that the conquered people were forced to 
remain in an inferior condition. The natives, for the most part, accepted their 
condition of vassalage as inevitable, and the position of the missionaries who, 
like Las Casas, sincerely believed in and preached the Christian doctrine of 
universal brotherhood, was thus rendered doubly difficult by coming in conflict 
with the interests of the conquerors on the one hand and the obvious inferior- 
ity of race and the acquiescence of the conquered on the other. Under these 
circumstances the missionaries could, at best, only assuage the severity of the 
servitude of the conquered races and lighten their yoke. This they accord- 
ingly effected through the Jesuit system of semireligious colonies referred to 
above, and the general Christianizing of the indigenous population by the other 
Catholic clergy. As proof that the Indians were not the equals of Huropeans, 
reference is made to their want of initiative, activity, and intelligence, and to 
the fact that after the expulsion of the Jesuits the mission Indians found them- 
selves more helpless than ever. Instead of augmenting their natural forces 
the Jesuit system had debilitated them. The same Christianity which added 
strength to the conquerors had only enervated the unfortunate conquered 
people. In a word, experience has demonstrated that the pure Indian was not 
Christianizable. Nevertheless, evangelization produced certain good results in
-P-A-G-E-365

the mixed bloods, descendants of the Spaniards and Indians, giving them a 
sense of cohesion and social harmony which facilitated the introduction in later 
times of the democratic idea. Without knowing it, those persevering and 
unpretending missionaries of the early days, who preached the gospel to sav- 
ages in virgin forests, were contributing their mite to the future growth of 
democracy and lay civilization among the free peoples of Spanish America. 
tk 
The University of Cordova.—tin the early part of the seventeenth century the 
Jesuits, who were established in the city of Cordova, founded there a college of 
their order called the ‘‘ Colegio Maximo.” In 1613 the Bishop of Tucuman 
granted the society funds for the purpose of widening the scope of the institu- 
tion and giving higher instruction in Latin, the arts, and theology to the students 
of the Colegio Maximo itself, as well as to students who might come from 
Paraguay and elsewhere. The Colegio Maximo was opened. under the new 
régime in 1614, and after it had acquired reputation it was raised by pontifical 
and royal decrees to the dignity of a university, until in 1622, by order of 
Philip III, it was authorized to grant the degrees of bachelor, licentiate, master, 
and doctor. The university was divided into two faculties, one of arts or 
philosophy and the other of theology. The faculty of arts comprised logic, 
physics, and the metaphysics of Aristotle, the courses occupying three years, 
after which there were two years of practice for the students, during which they 
were obliged to give lectures. The course in the theological faculty was four 
years, which was also followed by two years of practice or probation. The 
method of study was the mnemonic or the purely scholastic. In the three 
courses of the faculty of arts the instruction was cyclical; that is to say, one 
of the courses of study was completed and then dropped, and then another 
was taken, to be completed and dropped in its turn. The great defect of this 
system was, however, corrected by the two years of review or repetition, when 
the students were required to lecture. The philosophy studied at the university 
was the peripatetic or Aristotelian. Theology was taught from the Summa 
Theologize of St. Thomas Aquinas and the Liber Sententiarum of Peter Lombard. 
To this was added the vast work of Suarez, comprising the exposition of all 
the doctrines of the Society of Jesus. The studies of the faculty of arts were 
preparatory to those of the faculty of theology, yet it furnished the degrees 
of bachelor, licentiate, and master of arts. The degree of bachelor was con- 
ferred after completing the three courses of study mentioned above and passing 
a public examination in logic. For a degree of licentiate in arts, which fol- 
lowed in order, a year of lecturing was required, followed by a public defense 
of theses in the three studies, and for the third degree, that of master in arts, 
two years of probationary lecturing, followed by an examination covering the 
whole field of philosophy, were required. There were also three grades of 
degrees in theology corresponding to those in arts, viz, that of bachelor, 
licentiate, and doctor. The granting of these degrees was preceded by severe 
examinations held in public, and all the ceremonies were conducted with much 
solemnity. ‘They were occasions of pompous processions, in which the civic 
authorities took a conspicuous part with the ecclesiastics and the officials of 
the university, in escorting the candidates to the church and back to their 
dwellings after the bestowal of the degrees. Even the description of the official 
costumes prescribed for the students and for the candidates and successful 
graduates, besides the clergy, on these occasions is given in detail. 
The faculty of civil law was added to the university course in the eighteenth 
century after many difficulties, and authority to grant degrees in law was con-

854 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909, 
ferred upon the university in 1796, in consequence of which the law faculty 
gradually supplanted its elder theological brother in importance and influence. 
There were two Jesuit “ colegios,” or secondary schools, connected with the 
university, and after the expulsion of the Jesuits by Carlos III in 1767 both 
the university and its colleges were given over to the secular clergy, and sub- 
sequently to the Franciscan order, in whose charge it remained until it was 
secularized by decree of the King in 1800. This order was not, however, carried 
into effect until 1808, when the university began its new career under lay 
auspices and with a new system of instruction which lasted during the first 
half of the nineteenth century. This course of instruction comprised four 
faculties, viz, grammar, philosophy, theology, and law. ‘The philosophical 
faculty included four subdivisions, viz, (1) logic and metaphysics; (2) moral 
philosophy; (3) arithmetic, geometry, trigonometry, including surveying, and 
algebra (equations of the first degree) ; (4) physics, in which study it is to be 
noted that the experimental method was to be preferred to the systematic. The 
studies of theology and law followed the course in philosophy. The university 
maintained its aristocratic character until its “nationalization” (that is, until 
the national government assumed charge of it) in 1854. Up to that time purity 
of blood was a prerequisite to admission, and persons of mixed negro and white 
blood in particular were denied admission. Upon the declaration of independ- 
ence in 1818 the National Government, with its seat at Buenos Aires, declared 
itself the successor of the Spanish Crown in respect to authority over the 
university, and except an interval from the disturbances of 1820, when the 
control was assumed by the provincial government, until 1854, when the National 
Government resumed authority, the university has remained under the National 
Government ever since. The curriculum as rearranged was quite modern in its 
character and consisted of a preparatory course, so called, comprising Spanish, 
Latin, French, religion, geography, and practical arithmetic, which was followed 
by the courses of the regular faculties, philosophy (logic, ethics, mathematics, 
physics, and astronomy, one year each), theology (four years), and law (four 
years). The “cyclical” character of the course in philosophy, as the author 
of the article here translated calls it, is criticised by him as being a vicious 
system by which a student is led to follow a given study (logic, or ethics, or 
physics, ete.) for a year and then forget it. 
IV. 
Education in Buenos Aires and the coast, the viceroyalty of Rio de la Plata, 
during the nineteenth century—Both the Spanish population and the Spanish 
culture arrived at the territory which was afterwards known as the viceroyalty 
of Rio de la Plata in two distinct currents, one coming from Peru on the 
Pacific side of the continent, while the other reached the Atlantic coast directly 
from Europe. Only the first of these two currents was of importance as far 
as influence upon education is concerned during the seventeenth and eighteenth 
centuries. Crossing the northern part of the territory it ramified from Cor- 
dova, which city became its center, to Corrientes, Paraguay, and the boundary of 
Brazil. Its typical and important institutions were the University of Cordova 
and the missions of Paraguay. 
The other stream of colonists, which came directly from Spain to the coast 
country (the “litoral”), was less important from the point of view of educa- 
tion. They were, for the most part, rough “hidalgos” and military men who 
had no idea of establishing schools. The few and scattered centers of instruc- 
tion which were established among them were due to the northern immi- 
grants with whom came the religious congregations and the secular clergy as

   well. Later, at the end of the eighteenth century, during the reign of Carlos 
III, colonization from the Atlantic side increased in strength, but owing to the 
liberal political and religious ideas of that period, the new colonists were less 
under the religious influences than those who had arrived from the north. 
Nevertheless, the Viceroy Vertiz, who represented in Rio de la Plata the 
progressive politics of Carlos III, endeavored to establish a university in Buenos 
Aires, but although his project received the royal assent in 1778, it was not 
realized until much later. Meanwhile a college was established under the 
name of San Carlos in a building belonging to the Jesuits, in which instruction 
was given in grammar, rhetoric, philosophy, theology, and canon law after the 
old scholastic method, which was not in accordance with the new spirit of the 
times, and accordingly, after languishing some years, the college was suppressed 
definitely after the revolution of 1818. Vertiz also founded a medical school 
in 1780, while at the same time the nautical school and the school of geometry, 
in which architecture, perspective, and drawing were also taught, were estab- 
lished, both of which, however, came to a premature end in 1802. About this 
time, also, that is to say, previous to the nineteenth century, it is worthy of 
special historical interest to record, the revolutionary leader Belgrano @ desired 
to establish free primary schools besides special schools of agriculture, mathe- 
matics, and drawing, but his ideas were not then realized. The university of 
Buenos Aires owes its origin to the union of several struggling or moribund 
institutions, including those just mentioned and two or three similar colleges, 
which was effected in 1821. The university included in the scope of its activities 
ithe entire official instruction of the Province of Buenos Aires from the elementary 
schools to those of theology and jurisprudence. After the elementary schools 
came the department of secondary or preparatory studies, which included Latin, 
French, logic, metaphysics and rhetoric, physics and mathematics, and political 
leconomy. In the department of mathematics were included drawing and de- 
criptive geometry with applications. The medical department included the 
hree chairs of medicine, surgery, and clinics, both medical and surgical. The 
lepartment of law had two chairs, one of natural law and the law of nations, 
nd the other of civil law. The department of theology was left without 
specific provision until 1825, when the chairs of Greek and Latin, of evangelical 
orals and of ecclesiastical history and discipline, were founded. From the 
‘oregoing the practical and positive spirit in which the university was founded 
ill be seen. The preparatory studies and the medical and law departments 
ontinued to flourish and exert a beneficial influence upon Argentine culture, 
hile theology and mathematics did not acquire an equal importance or in- 
uence. The university languished, however, under the rule of Rozas, who even 
ermitted the return of the Jesuits and commanded the rector of the university 
io admit them to their ancient seat, until his power fell in 1852, after which 
lhe university was reorganized upon a wider scale in accordance with modern 
leas. The plan of the secondary studies was enlarged, the course in medicine 
as extended to six years, and in 1863 a faculty of exact sciences was added, 
lesides which enlargement of the university itself the government of the 
rovince established certain national colleges of secondary instruction under 
e direction of the university. Since 1882 the functions of the university have 
en conducted under the four faculties of humanities and philosophy, of 
edicine, of law and social science, and of mathematics and the physico-natural 
iences. Each faculty has its own teaching body and government and there 
besides a superior council, under the presidency of the rector, composed of 
  
¢ Belgrano, an Italian by origin, and a man of wealth, had received his education at the 
\iversity of Salamanca.

delegates from the several faculties. Since 1885, the date of the passage by 
the national congress of the university law which regulates both the university 
of Cordova and Buenos Aires, both institutions have ceased to give secondary 
instruction and have devoted themselves exclusively to superior studies, re- 
sembling in that respect the new university of La Plata, founded in 1906.

Education in Argentina in the second half of the nineteenth century.—Since 
1852 the National Government of Argentina has been actively engaged in reorgan- 
izing education throughout the country. Primary schools were established in 
various places, but the main efforts of the Government were directed toward 
improving secondary education, which was effected by establishing a number 
of national colegios, one in each provincial capital, each successive minister of 
public instruction—and there were frequent changes in the ministry between 
1852 and 1884, when the present course of studies was established—having a 
plan of his own. Since the latter date secondary instruction is confined to one 
national colegio, in which the character of the instruction is modern and ency- 
clopedic, while its ethical character is civic and democratic and the instructors 
are laymen. The same practical character is now given to primary instruction. 
Sarmiento, in his capacity as statesman and writer, turned to North America 
to find models for his country to follow, and in this he was followed by other 
patriots, conspicuous among them being Juan Maria Gutiérrez, in consequence 
of whose efforts the Argentine schools now have a marked democratic and prac- 
tical stamp. The seed which those statesmen planted fell upon a rich and 
responsive soil and is now bearing abundant fruit. 
ak 
Character of modern Argentine education—Modern Argentine education is 
the result of a violent reaction against the strong religious and monarchical 
spirit which dominated the old régime, in education as well as in politics, and 
from its inception it manifested the individualistic and democratic tendencies 
of the philosophy of the eighteenth century. Two orders of ideas influenced the 
molding of the new nationality, the modern European humanistic teachings, 
and North American constitutionalism. The new European humanistic doc- 
trines revealed themselves, although feebly, in the reforms of Carlos III, but 
acquired strength and body in the minds of the revolutionists. In spite of the 
prohibition by the Spanish Government of the introduction of books which 
would disseminate the new philosophy, the new ideas crossed the seas like the 
winds themselves, so that although the patriots could not find opportunities to 
read the original works of Montesquieu, Rousseau, and Voltaire, or the ency- 
clopedists, the doctrines of these writers became known to them, inspired thei 
thoughts, and determined their actions. Moreno, Monteagudo, Belgrano—al 
the great leaders and thinkers of the Argentine revolution—were more or les: 
romanticists and Jacobins. After the revolution the patriots found the mor 
typical and perfect realization of their political ideas in the North America: 
Republic. That democratic republic, therefore, became their exemplar and 
model of organization for them to copy. The ideals of a republic, of liberty 
and of the rule of the sovereign people represented their highest political aspi 
rations. American independence coincided very fortunately for their purpose: 
with the triumph of the French Revolution. 
With these elements and ideas the new nation was radically liberal an 
republican, and the population, although not really European by race, and no}
-P-A-G-E-369
  EDUCATIONAL CONDITIONS IN CHILE. 857 
sufficiently educated to make a proper use of republican ideas and institutions, 
which are difficult for novices to comprehend at first, still promptly assimilated 
the fundamental ideas of the new political organization, for a faculty of assimi- 
lation and a passion for progress have always been characteristic of the creole 
portion of the people. From the new culture could only result a democratic 
tendency and a profoundly practical spirit which affected education as well as 
politics. The scholastic spirit disappeared with the revolution, instruction 
ceased to be formal and abstract, and the classics were no longer cultivated with 
such zeal or so generally as in former years, but education followed the modern, 
practical tendency of the period, substituting the physico-natural sciences and 
modern languages for the old classical courses. The aim is no longer to pro- 
duce men of erudition, but enterprising citizens. 
Discipline has been and still is defective in Argentine institutions of educa- 
tion. There is much insubordination among the students, the explanation of 
which is to be found partly in the social spirit, and partly in the character of 
the creoles and the prevailing Jacobin ideas. But it is a mistake to complain of 
a fault which merely demonstrates the existence of an independent and manly 
spirit. When that spirit is subject to proper discipline, it will produce one of 
the most intelligent and generous peoples on earth, 
APPENDIX IL. 
A BRIEF SURVEY OF EDUCATIONAL CONDITIONS IN CHILE IN 1908. 
[Population, 3,399,928 in 1905.] 
The last report of this bureau contained a notice of the decided tendency to 
utilitarian or “modern” studies in higher education which Chile, in common 
with the other Spanish South American States, has developed in recent years. 
This tendency has arisen in response to a demand for studies of a practical 
and positive, or objective, nature in place of the old subjective introspective 
culture. The modern tendency is due to the rise of the industrial democracy 
during the latter half of the nineteenth century, and has been conspicuous in 
Europe as well as in the United States and South America. Further illustra- 
tion of this tendency in Chile is offered by the report of the minister of public 
instruction, presented to the National Congress in 1908, which gives a summary 
view of the condition of state education in Chile from the primary grades to 
the university. This order of arrangement—beginning with the lower grades 
and proceeding to the higher—which in itself is significant of a change of view 
in recent years, is followed in the present abstract. 
To render his review of state-supported instruction complete, the minister 
remarks, it is necessary to refer to those institutions which have received sub- 
ventions from the state as well as those which were founded by and are entirely 
supported by it. 
Private instruction is powerfully aided by the annual appropriations for the 
different secondary schools (liceos and colegios), which have been increasing” 
year by year until the sum amounted to $87,235 in 1907. The mean attendance 
at these schools for that year was 3,957, which makes the subvention $22.04 
for each student. In like manner the subvention for private primary schools 
rose in ten years from $49,490 in 1898 to $232,286 in 1907. These private 
schools had an average attendance of 13,898 children of both sexes during the 
latter year, making $16.71 for each pupil. Private schools are also assisted 
 
-P-A-G-E-370
  
858 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909, 
by the State through the gratuitous distribution of text-books and paper. 
The minister adds that although it is well for the treasury to be open-handed 
in its assistance to private schools in a country where there is so much illit- 
eracy as there is in Chile, still two considerations must be kept in view—one, 
that this assistance should not be so prodigal as to impede the development 
of the public or state schools, which have a much broader plan of studies than 
the private institutions, and the second, that the Government should not grant 
this assistance without careful examination, because, while there are schools 
and societies worthy of all credit, there are others, unfortunately, which do 
not faithfully perform their duties to the heads of families. 
To insure the proper performance of their functions, the Government at the 
close of 1907 obtained a grant of $109,500 as a subsidy to be paid to the pupils 
(at the rate of $7.30 a year each) of such private schools as would comply 
with the conditions contained in an ordinance which the Government issued at 
the same time. Among these conditions were provisions that the hygienic sur- 
roundings of the schools must be good; that the teachers must have diplomas 
from the normal schools, or have bachelors’ degrees in the humanities, or pass 
examinations; that reading, writing, elementary arithmetic, geography, and 
history of Chile be taught; that the schools should be in operation at least 
one hundred and fifty days in the year, and that they should be subject to 
inspection by the regular inspector of the public schools. 
A table showing the growth of the state primary schools from 1891 to 1907 
shows that in the latter year there were 2,319 such schools, with 3,997 teachers, 
an enrollment of 197,174, and a mean attendance of 121,176, or 61.4 per cent of 
the enrollment. The number of teachers in 1907 who were graduates from a 
normal school was 1,415, against 2,582 who were not “ normalists,” wherefore 
the Government determined to stimulate the zeal of those teachers who have 
not had a normal course by giving them facilities to study in a pedagogical 
seminary, and to that end issued an ordinance providing for the examination of 
such teachers at a normal school before an examining board for the purpose 
of granting diplomas as qualified teachers. The subjects prescribed for exami- 
nation include methodology and manual training, with the usual subjects of 
study of primary schools. 
Promotions in the public school service, as in all branches of the Govern- 
ment, should be based solely upon merit and not be due to favor. Only those 
normal teachers, therefore, should be appointed directors of superior schools 
who are proved to be worthy of the trust by their intelligence and high char- 
acter and their experience in teaching. 
Appointments to these places were, accordingly, made subject to competitive 
examination by a decree of May 25, 1908, which provides minutely for the 
conduct of such examinations before an examining board at some one of the 
state normal schools. 
In recent years manual training has developed to a considerable extent in 
the public schools of Chile, the first 10 carpenter shops having been established 
in 1899, while in 1907 there were 29 carpenter shops, with 908 pupils working 
in them; 40 shops for working in pasteboard, with 1,270 pupils; and 51 shops 
for needlework, with 5,100 girls at work in them. 
The Swiss method of instruction has been followed in these schools, with 
the view of cultivating the natural aptitude of the pupils, but a more practical 
end will be observed in future and the instruction will be correspondingly 
modified and the number of shops greatly increased. specially is this prac- 
tical object to be kept in view in the superior schools, where the pupils will be 
taught mechanical trades, so that they can enter into business readily.

EDUCATIONAL CONDITIONS IN CHILE. 859 
In 1908 there were 15 normal schools for the training of teachers in Chile, 
6 for men and 9 for women, and a new normal school for women was established 
that year in the Province of Malleco. 
The following table gives the statistics of normal schools for 1907:

The Government is so sensible of the importance of the normal schools that 
a special decree was published under date of April 27, 1908, with reference 
to the appointment of teachers, in accordance wherewith “normalists” (i. e., 
graduates of a normal school) who have completed the course of the Peda- 
gogical Institute and those who have studied at the Institute of Physical and 
Manual Training are to be preferred as teachers in normal schools, and if 
such candidates are not available, then those who have diplomas as teachers 
in normal schools or university graduates will be accepted, thus precluding 
the possibility of filling the positions with unqualified persons. 
The plan of studies of these schools has also been modified, more reliance 
being placed upon the study of text-books and works of reference than here- 
tofore when the students were accustomed to make notes of the lectures of 
the professors. The list of works includes the names of several French and 
German authors (Compayré, Schuffe, Schutzer). 
Commercial education in Chile, so far as it has developed, is a growth of 
recent years. A list of nine commercial institutes in as many cities is given, 
with an average attendance of 934 students in 1907. By a decree of May 26, 
1908, the following industrial course of study was prescribed for the technical 
commercial institute of Iquique, which prepares its students to be employees 
of the Government and analysts and technical experts for the saltpeter indus- 
try: English, German (elective), wood and iron working, industrial chemistry, 
machines and motors, electricity, and drawing—the last four subjects being 
studied practically in the laboratory and shops. 
Secondary education.—The law of January 9, 1879, provides that there shall 
be at least one establishment of secondary instruction in each province; that 
is to say, that there should be one liceo for young men in each of the twenty- 
three proyincial capitals. Many other liceos have since been created in different 
cities, until in 1907 there were 39 in the whole country, with an enrollment of 
9,302 and an average attendance of 7,896; there are, besides, 31 liceos for young 
women, supported by the State, with an enrollment of 4,810 and an average 
lattendance of 3,889. The courses of study in these liceos are designated in the 
tables as “preparatory” and the “ humanities,’ the latter being the usual 
secondary course, to which the new studies of civics, psychology, philosophy 
lof the sciences, and general history of civilization were to be added. The 
verage attendance on the course of the humanities was 4,555 young men and 
5179 young women in 1908,  
-P-A-G-E-372
    
860 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909, 
The preparatory course in the liceos for girls is of three years, and in some 
cases the first-year course appears to be designed for very young pupils. 
Superior instructionHigher education in Chile is placed by law under the 
direction of the council of public instruction, while the University of Chile in its 
various establishments is the actual seat of this branch of instruction. As 
stated by the minister in his report, the university has not only been the foun- 
tain of instruction and learning as such, but has been the source of the pro- 
gressive ideas in educational reform which have so rapidly modified the 
intellectual condition of the people in recent years. 
The council of public instruction was for forty years, under the name of the 
council of the university, the principal auxiliary of the Government in all 
educational matters, whether relating to primary, secondary, or superior instruc- 
tion. It was, however, deprived of its jurisdiction over primary instruction 
by the law of 1879, while its authority over the other two branches was made 
supreme, and during these thirty years it has accomplished a notable work. It 
is charged with the duty of conferring degrees and titles which qualify the 
students to practice professions or enter the public service, and has provided a 
series of examinations as a condition precedent to granting the degrees. This 
has been the powerful lever by means of which the council has fomented so 
efficaciously the intellectual development of the country. The degree of bachelor 
of the humanities is evidence that the student possesses all the ideas which are 
indispensable to a man of cultivation and a good citizen. The degree of licen- 
tiate in law or medicine or mathematics (engineering) is clear proof not only 
that its possessor is qualified to practice the corresponding profession, but it 
also implies that he knows, and knows well, other subjects of study which, 
although they may not be necessary in the practice of his profession, yet give 
_ him greater breadth of view and stability of principle. The council has in this 
way been of great service to the country directly and indirectly, and it has also 
contributed to the general education of the people through its own publications, 
such as the Anales de la Universidad, and by publishing other important works 
and granting premiums. 
The faculty of law is composed of the leading judges and advocates of the 
Chilean bar. In 1907 the number of law students was 476. The minister of 
foreign relations has proposed that a course should be established in the law 
school for the training of young men for the diplomatic and consular service. 
The medical faculty, like that of the law, is composed of the most distin- 
guished practitioners in Santiago, and the students numbered 232 in 1907. 
The school of pharmacy connected with the medical faculty had an enrollment 
of 54 in that year, the school of dentistry 80, and the school of matrons 37. 
The mathematical course of the university is on a par with those of law and 
medicine. Its teaching force is composed of Chilean engineers of high stand- 
ing, together with some foreigners. 
On September 19, 1907, the Government, upon the recommendation of the 
council of public instruction, created a special class for the study of the ex- 
ploitation of saltpeter and analogous salts, the great importance of the salt- 
peter industry to Chile making that step advisable. The professor will be 
required to make reports to the Government upon the manufacture of fertilizers 
in foreign countries. 
Another.new chair in the mathematical course is that of seismology and 
seismic architecture, suggested particularly by the earthquake of 1906. The 
services of Prof. Montessus de Ballore were secured to fill this chair and to 
erect and superintend a seismological observatory. 
In 1907 there were 250 students in the mathematical faculty. 
 
-P-A-G-E-373
  EDUCATIONAL CONDITIONS IN CHILE. 361 
There are an astronomical observatory, the museums of natural history of 
Santiago, Valparaiso, and Concepci6én, and a botanical garden, connected more or 
less directly with the faculty of physical sciences and mathematics. 
Much space is given in the report of the minister of the pedagogical institute, 
which may be regarded as the teachers’ section of the faculty of philosophy and 
humanities. This institute was created twenty years ago, and has ever since 
been acquiring the development and influence its founders hoped for. Its 
students were at first internes, but this system was soon abolished and now 
only externes are admitted. It has graduated 310 teachers of both sexes, and 
the matriculation for 1907 showed 205 names. The principal recent improyve- 
ment has been the installation of cabinets and laboratories of physics, chem- 
istry, and the biological sciences, while the plan of studies was considerably 
modified in the latter part of 1907. There are now seven courses, viz: (1) 
Spanish, (2) French, (3) English, (4) German, (5) history and geography, 
(6) mathematics and physics, (7) biological sciences, chemistry, and mineral- 
ogy. All students of the institute are required to study (1) theoretical and 
practical pedagogy, (2) experimental psychology, (3) logic, ethics, and the 
history of philosophical systems, and (4) civics and elements of school legisla- 
tion. A list of the studies prescribed for one of the courses, that in Spanish, 
will give an idea of those in the four others in languages, as they are prac- 
tically identical, excepting the language which gives the name of the course. 
Course in Spanish: Style and composition, Spanish linguistics, Latin, some 
foreign language (French, German, or English), theoretical pedagogy, psy- 
chology, logic and ethics, history of philosophical systems, civics. 
An idea of the scope of the instruction in the foregoing may be obtained 
from one subject, viz, Spanish literature. This is divided into three heads: (1) 
Latin, anteclassical and classical literature of Spain. (2) Contemporary 
literature. (3) History of Spanish-American literature, colonial and post- 
revolutionary. 
The other subjects are similarly treated, and examination topics correspond- 
ing to and fully covering each general subject are given. 
Under chemistry and mineralogy are included the theoretical and experi- 
mental study of general chemistry; inorganic chemistry, with qualitative and 
quantitative mineral analysis, including volumetric analysis; organic chemistry, 
theoretical and descriptive, preparation of organic compounds, including syn- 
thesis, elementary organic analysis and determination of formulas, application 
of analysis to foods, drinks, and industrial products; crystallography, geomet- 
rical and physical, with goniometry, general and descriptive mineralogy, the 
principal mineral species, determination of minerals and blow-pipe assay; 
petrography, the most important rocks and their origin, preparation of thin 
sections, and determination by means of the microscope. 
The foregoing shows a very comprehensive course in chemistry and miner- 
alogy, including petrography, sufficient, it would seem, to give a student ample 
knowledge not only to teach the subject intelligently, but also to enable him to 
pursue the study by himself. 
Systematic pedagogy includes, (A) theoretical part. Under this come, (1) 
the study of the pupil: (a) the fundamental laws of psychological life, 
psychology, and paidology; (b) the ideal forms of psychical life, ethics, logic. 
(2) The study of the educator, which includes (a) general methodology of 
education, especially secondary; (0) special didactics of the different subjects 
taught in secondary schools. (B) The practical part: (1) Psychological investi- 
gations in the laboratory; (2) attendance at the practice school, practice recita- 
tions and criticism.

  362 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
The Spanish-American countries, following the Latin traditions, maintain 
schools of art and music as public institutions supported by the State. The 
studies of the schools of fine arts in Chile include painting, drawing, sculpture, 
engraving, and architecture, and the teachers are often European artists who 
have received prizes for their work in Paris or Spain. There were 243 pupils 
of both sexes at the two schools of fine and decorative art in 1907, and 144 male 
and 489 female students at the national conservatory of music. This institution 
is of great benefit to the middle class of the population, since the greater part 
of its graduates become teachers of the piano and singing, and are trained to 
become actors and actresses.

secondary education is omitted from the table, complete statistics 
pertaining to this department of education not being attainable. It 
should be observed that the term “ secondary ” has different applica- 
tions in the three divisions of the Kingdom. In England secondary 
schools are not a link between public elementary schools and higher 
institutions. They offer a distinct course of education, parallel in a 
sense to the elementary school but extending far beyond it. This is, 
in a measure, true also of the intermediate (secondary) schools of 
Treland. In Scotland the secondary school, as a rule, is continuous 
with the elementary school, and keeps an open course from the latter 
to the university. As a consequence of the recent extension of gov- 
ernment aid and supervision to secondary education and the closely 
allied province of technical education, common purposes and en- 
deavors are developing in this department throughout the Kingdom. 
The first step in the new field was necessarily that of an inventory 
of present conditions, and thus information as to the number and 
character of secondary schools and technical institutions is rapidly 
increasing in volume and accuracy. Summaries pertaining to the 
former are given in the series of tables at the close of this chapter. 
Elementary education is organized under government direction in 
the three divisions of the United Kingdom, and the magnitude of this 
work is indicated, in a measure, by the enrollment in elementary 
schools, as given in Table 1. In England and Wales the enrollment 
is equivalent to 17 per cent of the population, in Scotland to 17 per 
cent, and in Ireland to 16.5 per cent. Comparison of the number of 
students in universities and university colleges in each division of 
the Kingdom (so far as tabulated) with the corresponding popula- 
tions shows, for England, 1 student for every 1,291 inhabitants; 
Scotland, 1 for every 604 inhabitants; and Ireland, 1 for every 
1,935 inhabitants. 
The extension of government aid to “higher education” has in- 
creased the annual appropriations by Parliament for this service. 
The total amount voted for education, science, and art in the three 
divisions of the Kingdom for the year ending March 31, 1909, was 
£17,685,886 (equivalent to $86,059,521). The estimate for the year 
ending March 31, 1910, is £17,911,143 (equivalent to $87,155,622). 
Omitting the grants for science and art, and the grants for uni- 
versities and colleges in England and Wales (the latter amounting 
in 1908 to £221,800 and in 1909 to £217,400), the grants administered 
by the education departments in 1908-9 were as follows: England, 
£13,587,806 ($66,118,264) ; Scotland, £2,048,557 ($9,968,278) ; Ireland, 
£1,544,818 ($7,517,084). The corresponding estimates for 1909-10 
are, England, £13,648,792 ($66,415,022) ; Scotland, £2,147,541 ($10,-

449,934); Ireland, £1,621,921 ($7,892,267). Elementary education 
absorbs by far the larger part of these funds—in England, about 85 
per cent; in Scotland, 94 per cent. In Ireland the annual parlia- 
mentary grant meets practically the entire expenditure for the 
national schools.

EDUCATION IN ENGLAND. 
LEGISLATIVE MEASURES. 
The year has been marked in England by discussions and activities 
growing out of legislative measures, the course of which was inter- 
rupted by the adjournment of Parliament for the long vacation 
(August 1).* Early in the fall term the education bill introduced by 
Mr. McKenna was withdrawn in view of the impossibility of securing 
the agreement of both houses upon its main provisions. This, it 
will be recalled, was the second measure submitted by the Liberal 
government since its accession to power, as the result of the election 
of 1905, having for its purpose the placing of all the public ele- 
mentary schools of England under the control of public authorities.? 
A substitute measure, the outcome of the conferences of the educa- 
tion settlement committee, was introduced (November 20, 1908) by 
Mr. Runciman, who had succeeded Mr. McKenna as president of the 
board of education. This bill authorized denominational instruc- 
tion in council schools (schools established by local authorities) under 
certain restrictions, in return for the exclusion of all voluntary 
schools from a share in the local taxes. Voluntary schools were 
allowed to continue with aid from parliamentary grants under the 
conditions determined by the education act of 1870.° The bill proved 
utterly futile as a means of satisfying the opposing interests of public 
and parochial school, and after a fortnight was speedily abandoned. 
Thus terminated the efforts to annul or modify the provisions of the 
education act of 1902, which remains in full force. 
The children act, which was passed soon after the reassembling of 
Parliament and received royal sanction December 21, 1908, went 
into effect the 1st of April, current year. Although not strictly an 
educational measure, it deals with matters closely related to the latter 
interest. While the main purpose of the new law is to bring into one 
well-ordered statute previous enactments on the same subject, it also 
improves and extends the provision of former laws for the care and 
control of the child population. It therefore increases the responsi- 
bilities of all authorities that are charged with these duties. Among 
these are the executive officers of local education departments, their 
legal and medical advisers, school-attendance officers, and even 
teachers themselves. 
  
«The previous report of this series was sent to press in October, 1908; consequently the 
present review relates to the twelve months ending October 1, 1909.

    The most important of the new provisions comprised in the chil- 
dren act pertains to the treatment of juvenile offenders. The insti- 
tution of separate courts for children’s cases is required throughout 
the country, following thus the lead of several English towns, notably 
Birmingham. 
The law forbids the imprisonment of any child under 14 years of 
age, or of any person between the ages of 14 and 16, unless the latter 
is proved to be so depraved or unruly that he can not safely be cared 
for in a house of detention. It also prohibits the commitment of a 
child under 12 years of age to a reformatory school. 
The provisions referred to, which deal in a comprehensive manner 
with the whole matter of juvenile offenders, affect the cases of truant 
children. These have often been allowed to pass unnoticed by judi- 
cious and human officials on account of their reluctance to bring 
such children into contact with the criminal courts. 
As a consequence of the discussions excited by the school-attendance 
bill, which was introduced by Lord Stanley, of Alderley, but failed 
to pass to second reading, an interdepartmental committee was ap- 
pointed in July, 1908, to inquire into the conditions of partial exemp- 
tion from school attendance throughout the country. The report of 
this committee, submitted in August of the present year, will be con- 
sidered farther on. It suffices to say here that the committee agree 
in an unqualified condemnation of the half-time system and in rec- 
ommendations looking to its speedy abolition. 
Intimately related to the investigations above referred to is that 
of the consultative committee of the board of education on “Attend- 
ance compulsory or otherwise at continuation schools.” This investi- 
gation was prompted in part by the general agitation of the subject 
of the unemployed in England and the constant increase in their 
ranks from youths unprepared for definite vocations or for skilled 
labor. As an immediate reason for such an investigation reference is 
made in the instructions to the committee to the provision of the edu- 
cation law for Scotland, 1908, authorizing local school boards to 
require the attendance of children at continuation classes or schools 
under specified conditions. 
The report of the consultative committee is an important contribu- 
tion to the rapidly accumulating information on labor problems and 
their relation to education. As will be seen from subsequent cita- 
tions, it confirms many of the opinions and recommendations of the 
interdepartmental committee. 
ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITIES. 
The failure of the legislative measures proposed by the Liberal 
arty is offset in various ways by the action of the board of educa- 
tion and the county and county borough councils, which together
-P-A-G-E-380
ee Ee Re nn ee ee eee 
3868 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
control the public funds for the maintenance of schools. The board 
of education administers the parliamentary grants for education and, 
subject to the approval of Parliament, determines the conditions on 
which schools and higher institutions shall share in the funds. It 
has become, therefore, a directive and unifying force in elementary 
education, and is rapidly assuming a similar relation to secondary 
and technical education. This influence is exercised by the service 
of inspection, by the reports of special inquiries, and by educational 
- pamphlets issued from time to time on subjects of timely interest or 
pressing importance. The board also has certain advisory and judi- 
cial functions. The scope of the supervisory powers of the board as 
extended by the education act of 1902 is indicated by Table 2 in the 
statistical summaries appended to this general statement. 
The local authorities for education, recognized by the law of 1902, 
include at present 62 county councils, 74 county boroughs, 137 au- 
tonomous municipal boroughs, 54 urban districts, and the Isles of 
Scilly; total, 828. The county and borough councils exercise their 
powers with respect to the schools in their respective areas through 
education committees, excepting those relating to the expenditure of 
money. In respect to finances the councils are supreme and their 
powers can not be delegated. The councils disburse the parliamen- 
tary grant in their several areas and determine the amount of local 
taxes annually required to meet the additional expenditures for edu- 
cation. The latter represent levies varying from 1.5d. to 27.1d. in 
the pound sterling. The extent of these local jurisdictions is indi- 
cated by Table 3, showing the distribution of scholars among the 
different classes of areas. 
The schools and higher institutions under the supervision of public 
authorities are classed in the education act of 1902 under two heads: 
Elementary education and higher education. To the first of these 
classes belong the public elementary schools which are supported by 
parliamentary grants and local taxes. These are either provided, 
that is, established by the public authority, or nonprovided; the latter 
being chiefly parochial.   ADMINISTRATIVE DIFFICULTIES OF THE DUAL SYSTEM OF SCHOOLS. 
In 1903-4 the nonprovided schools enrolled 50.8 per cent of the 
children in public.elementary schools; for the year ending August 1, 
1907, they had an average enrollment equivalent to 45.7 per cent of 
the total. The decline is due, in great part, to the superiority of pro- 
vided schools in the great municipalities; it has been accelerated, how- 
ever, by opposition to the use of local taxes for the support of paro- 
chial schools. The opposition of the Welsh councils to this provi- 
sion of the law of 1902, “the Welsh revolt,” as it is termed, reached 
a crisis during the year under review in the case of the Swansea bor- 
 
-P-A-G-E-381
    
EDUCATION IN ENGLAND. 369 
ough council in respect to a Church of England school within the 
area. The managers of the school charged that the local authority 
discriminated between teachers in that school and those in the pro- 
vided schools by the lower scale of salaries allowed in the case of the 
former. The charge was not denied; but on their part the borough 
council contend that their control of expenditure is “ itself uncon- 
trolled and uncontrollable.” 
Upon an appeal to the board of education, the action of the local 
authorities was sustained. The case was then carried into the court 
of king’s bench, where judgment was given against the decision of 
the board of education. Notice of appeal was immediately entered, 
at which point the case now rests. 
The School Government Chronicle, in an editorial on the judgment 
of the court, says: 
Whatever may be the ultimate decision in the great Swansea case, it can 
hardly be displaced from its rank as the most important of all the more or 
less well-remembered decisions of the courts for which the education act of 
1902 has given occasion. Notice of appeal was entered immediately after 
delivery of the decision of the lord chief justice and the two other learned 
judges associated with him in the hearing of the arguments last week in the 
court of king’s bench. And there is every likelihood that we shall have to wait 
not only for judgment of the court of appeal, but for the review of that judg- 
ment—whatever it may be—according to the larger outlook which the House 
of Lords, in its high judicial capacity, is enabled to take upon issues of law, be- 
fore we shall have it for a certain fact that the effect of the act is, or is not, 
as the three judges have for the time being defined it. Yet the judgment now 
before us, whether it be upheld, reversed, or only modified in the ultimate 
stage of appeal, runs no risk of mere futility. In any event and at the least 
it contributes more than any other legal incident of the six years or so, during 
which the act has been operative, to demonstration of the instability of some 
of the most distinctive features of that statute.* 
The continued opposition of English Nonconformists to the set- 
tlement of 1902 is indicated by the revival of passive resistance. 
Measures have been taken during the year to organize this movement 
and federate “ passive resisters” throughout the country. The sig- 
nificance of this opposition is indicated in a public address by Mr. 
Runciman on the “ Education question.” Referring to the rejection 
of the compromise bill which he submitted to Parliament, he said in 
substance : 
They would have had one great national system had the bill gone through; 
but they made exceptions for those religious communities which could not in 
harmony with their faith and practice come into the general system; they made 
exceptions in the case of the Roman Catholics, and of those English churchmen 
who were like unto them. No proposal more distasteful to Nonconformists 
was ever made than the right of entry, and unfortunately English churchmen 
so little knew the Nonconformist point of view or the Nonconformist temper

that they never realized the sacrifice they made in order to arrive at a peaceful 
conclusion. ‘That handsome offer was rejected. I doubt very much whether 
it will ever be made again. We have fought right of entry in the past because 
we considered it a sheer act of aggression with no compensation on the other 
side. I made my appeal then—an appeal which I hope is not to be ended with 
the events of last autumn, although I for one will not set my hand to a similar 
measure—but I make my appeal to churchmen and Nonconformists to take a 
broad view. This world is not so good that we can afford to dissipate religious 
forces by mere squabbles and quarrels. The church may sooner or later have 
to give up some privileges in order to obtain a settlement, but for her the 
sacrifice will be well worth while.” Things must now take their natural 
course; and he would remind them what the natural course was. Council 
schools were every day increasing; denominational schools were every day 
decreasing. From 1906 to 1908 in the council schools the increase had been 
246,000 children in accommodation and 125,000 in average attendance. In the 
denominational schools in the same period there was a decrease of 205,000 in 
accommodation and 147,000 in attendance. That showed the natural tendency 
of events. Then churchmen would do well to keep in mind the fact that there 
was such a thing as the onward march of local government. The local govern- 
ment bodies were not going to tolerate the present state of things for ever. 
They would insist on the schools being kept in good repair. They would do 
what they could to avoid friction as to the appointment of teachers. They 
would not tolerate one-third of the managers alone being representatives of the 
public bodies, and those who thought they had ended the education fight by 
bringing about the withdrawal of the bill last autumn were mightily mistaken. 
Whatever happened, natural public events would fight against the denomina- 
tionists. Public bodies had the whole force of public opinion on their side, 
and he ventured to say that, without vindictive administration, they would find 
before this Government went out of power, the denominationists would be in a 
weaker position than ever they were before. He said “without any vindictive 
administration.” He wished to impress that upon them, because he would not 
be a party to any vindictive administration whatever. ‘ While I am at the 
education office, I shall endeavor to be just, not vindictive. My first considera- 
tion is the child; my second consideration is the teacher.” The negotiations, 
however, were not all lost labor. They got a new and better atmosphere. He 
believed the day was now near when our own obstinate, ferocious polemics 
" would be shrivelled up and forgotten in the ambition to excel untrammeled in 
the instruction of the young.* 
It may be noted in this connection that in the exercise of the power 
conferred upon them by the act of 1902 to require that the managers 
of a voluntary school shall keep the buildings and equipments of the 
school up to a certain standard, local authorities have gone far in 
the elimination of inferior schools from the list of those recognized 
as efficient. 
DEMAND FOR SMALLER AREAS FOR LOCAL ADMINISTRATION. 
Apart from the inherent difficulties arising from the dual system 
of schools, the pressing problem of school administration in England 
is that of the local area.

  EDUCATION IN ENGLAND. 871 
Since the passage of the act of 1902, experience has: shown that 
while the county is the desirable area for certain purposes, much has 
been lost by the abolition of smaller areas for the direct control of 
elementary schools. The general recognition of the need of reform 
at this point is indicated by the fact that the delegation clause of the 
defeated education bill of 1906 received the assent of the House of 
Lords as it went from the Commons. The clause was reproduced 
as a separate bill in the present session, but on account of the pres- 
sure of other matters it was dropped at the end of the session. 
The need of reform in this particular was the chief topic of discus- 
sion in the annual meeting of the National Education Association, 
which adopted without dissent the following resolution : 
That in view of the acknowledged need to secure greater local interest and 
real popular control in educational affairs we consider that reforms in the 
system of local administration are urgently needed, especially in the direction of 
securing the direct popular election of local authorities having only educa- 
tional duties to perform. 
The author of the resolution, Mr. Gordon Harvey, drew graphic 
contrast between conditions under the former school board and 
present conditions in his own community. He said, in substance, 
that— 
he was chairman of a school board which had some 2,000 children under its 
care, and they carried on the education of the district for nine years, and 
carried it on well. Those were delightful days for the education administrator. 
They were popularly elected; they knew their people, and the people knew 
them. They knew their teachers, and they knew the individual children under 
their care. Their meetings were held in the afternoon at the very doors of 
the representatives of the people, and all classes were consequently able to 
take their part and their share in the local administration of education. They 
had their press reports, and the public were constantly interested in, and very 
often properly critical of their deeds. Their school authority was the center 
of educational life in that little district. They had their extension lectures 
and their Gilchrist lectures, and they administered education with a special 
knowledge of the local requirements of the district, and every three years they 
came out to the field of battle and got into close touch with their constituents 
through an electoral campaign. In 1902 all this work was taken out. of their 
hands and given to the great widespread authority of the county council of 
Lancashire. Now, he knew what a difference that made. He knew that the 
county council of Lancashire tried to do its best in the difficult task it had 
been called upon to perform. He knew that all the more because he was chair- 
man of the Lancashire elementary education committee, which took over the 
work. The only way in which they could do that work was by doing some- 
thing outside the law, and cooperating no fewer than 1,000 persons up and down 
the county to help them in their task; but the center of education zeal in 
Lancashire, if he might use such a term, became 40 miles away from its home, 
and all local interest in the varying localities of the county in education was 
gone. He was only telling them a familiar story, but what were they to do to 
get back what they had lost? They could not get rid of the county councils, 
and he for one would admit that some advantage had come to education through 
 
-P-A-G-E-384
3872 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
the county councils. At any rate, they had raised up to something like a 
decent level some of the more backward districts in the county. But he did 
not think for a moment that the county council was fit to be more than the 
compelling power behind local authorities. He did not think they ought to 
take up any questions except those of the very widest and most general interest. 
They must get back into close touch with the parents of the children who used 
their school. They must regain the education enthusiasts of the locality to 
assist them in their task. He thought they ought to insist upon popular elec- 
tion of local representatives; and also upon having the power to levy a local 
rate if the enthusiasm of the district was such that the people were willing 
to submit to a greater rate than that which prevailed over the entire country. 
He had no feeling of worship for the uniform rate if he could do better by 
differential rating. He did maintain that what was happening now was that 
they had lost education zeal; education was becoming bureaucratic and official, 
and although certain districts may have been leveled up, yet the better and 
more enthusiastic districts had been leveled down. It was with the view of 
regaining the position they had lost, and for the objects which he had ventured 
to state, that he recommended the resolution for their acceptance. 
Lord Stanley, of Alderley, speaking on the resolution, said: 
There were two things in this question before them. They wanted the direct 
association of the people by their own representatives, and they wanted to secure 
the continuance of the readmission of the small people of the country. * * * 
He viewed with dismay the apparent ignorant acquiescence of the newspapers 
to the reform of the poor law, and how they seemed to think it the right thing 
to center the whole of this administration into great areas like counties, and to 
throw this special burden upon already overburdened bodies which had already 
very difficult duties to perform. Every institution was capable of reform, the 
school boards were capable of reform, but there was a vast difference between 
reforming and putting life into an organization and superseding it by piling its 
duties in a mechanical way on some other body because it happened to be handy. 
He could not say how strongly he felt on the matters dealt with in that resolu- 
tion, and as to the reasonable alteration of the area. He was talking of 
elementary education because he quite recognized that in secondary education 
they did require a larger area than for elementary. In elementary education 
they wanted the direct association of the people themselves, and a recognition, 
as had been pointed out, of the various aptitudes and preferences and enthusi- 
asms of those who were willing to give a part of their time to the public service, 
He felt that the resolution in more ways than one was the most important of 
their resolutions, because they had through good and evil report kept this ideal 
to themselves of the direct association of the people with the management of 
their own affairs, and therefore the keeping of such areas as would insure that. 
How did they suppose that the farmer, or village shopkeeper, or dissenting 
minister, or local clergyman, or any other men like them, living in little towns 
and villages in Devonshire found time to go to Exeter for the business of edu- 
eation? In counties not so large as Devonshire, owing to bad railway facilities, 
a visit to the county town to do business meant staying the night, and it was 
absolutely essential, if they were not going to have local government in the 
hands of those who had absolute leisure, like the class who formerly constituted 
the old courts of quarter sessions, that they should have areas of moderate size. 
Of course, gentlemen who lived in the county and were willing to serve should

have the opportunity. They were men of good education, who were accustomed 
to responsibilities in connection with their own estates, and they gave a good 
lead to the others. But they should come in by popular election, and by this 
means they would get a beautiful mixture of all social classes in the work. If, 
however, they fell back on the country for everything, they destroyed local life. 
He quite thought it might have gone so far that they would have to keep the 
county council in existence as a supervising and disciplining power, but he was 
quite sure that for the daily work of elementary education they must put the 
principal and the real responsibility upon smaller locally elected assemblies. 
They would never get any better organization of education until they got unity 
of control of the school. When they made education as thoroughly a matter of 
public responsibility and public concern as they made their other local municipal 
functions, then they would be able to bring the good will and cooperation of all 
the earnest people of the country to their work of development and make 
progress. He was not so much afraid of the question of cost when people felt 
that they were really managing their own affairs. Those schools in west 
Canada were maintained almost entirely out of the local rates. When people 
felt that a thing really belonged to them it did not take them very long before 
they determined out of their own pockets to have a good thing for themselves, 
but who cared in the case of counties like Lancashire or Yorkshire, where an 
official came round to have his papers filled up, and so on. He felt that if they 
did nothing more than pass that resolution they would do a good afternoon’s 
work.” 
MOVEMENT FOR PROMOTING RURAL EDUCATION. 
The discussion of the question of local administraticn indirectly 
illustrates the distinction between urban and rural conditions. While 
urban districts are, in the main, sufficient to themselves, rural dis- 
tricts require help and stimulus from without. The county councils 
have manifested special interest in the problems of rural education, 
and during the year an important conference on the subject was held 
in London, called together by the County Councils Association, act- 
ing in conjunction with the Central Land Association, the Central 
Chamber of Agriculture, and the Farmers’ Club. 
The reasons for calling the conference, as stated by the chairman, 
were— = 
First, the strong feeling that existed that the present curriculum was not 
sufficiently adapted to present-day needs; secondly, last year’s report of the 
departmental committee on agricultural education; thirdly, the widespread 
feeling that the board of education and the board of agriculture were not in 
sufficiently close working; and, fourthly, the need for larger grants. 
The problems discussed and the conclusions of the conference 
respecting them are indicated by the following resolutions, the first 
of which was referred to a special committee and the remainder 
adopted: 
1. That the attention of local education authorities should be directed to 
securing in elementary schools in rural districts better instruction in rural

874 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
subjects and adaptation of the teaching generally to the circumstances of 
country life. That in order to facilitate these objects, school gardens and 
equipment for manual instruction should be provided and elementary-school 
teachers should be trained so as to be more capable of giving the special instruc- 
tion required. 
2. That it is desirable to continue the education of boys who have shown apti- 
tude for agricultural pursuits by means of scholarships tenable at suitable sec- 
ondary and continuation schools. That in such schools nature study and ele- 
mentary science teaching of a practical character should be given in close con- 
nection with practical work in school gardens and workshops, and the knowledge 
thus acquired should be made applicable to the agricultural industry. That 
more trained teachers capable of giving instruction in rural subjects are needed 
and should be provided by the local-education authorities. 
38. That each group of counties should be connected with an agricultural 
college or institute equipped with an efficient staff and apparatus for giving 
the higher forms of agricultural instruction, both practical and scientific. That 
the local education authorities should provide scholarships for continuing the 
education of young men from the secondary school at such institutions. That a 
portion of the staff of the institution should be available for peripatetic instruc- 
tion in the adjoining counties. That the institution should be supported by 
contributions from the counties as well as from the central department, and 
that experimental farms and stations should be maintained in connection with 
each college or institute. 
4, That local education authorities should provide technical instruction for 
young farmers and agricultural laborers of the age of 16 and upward in winter 
courses or periodical classes at convenient centers in, among others, the 
following processes of agriculture: Dairying, thatching, hedging, draining, 
walling, cider making, fruit culture, poultry and bee keeping, and also in the 
following among other subjects: The nature of soils and manures, the character- 
istics and diseases of farm animals, insects, and other pests, surveying and 
measuring, and farriery. That the local agricultural societies should cooperate 
in this work. 
5. That it is desirable that the central supervision of agricultural education 
should be intrusted to the board of education and the board of agriculture, the 
former being responsible for elementary, secondary, and continuation schools, 
and the latter for instruction of a specially agricultural character; but that 
in order to secure proper coordination between the work of the two departments, 
all questions of common interest concerning rural education, including the 
allocation of funds, should be referred to and considered by an interdepart- 
mental committee, which shall report to each board, and that such committee 
should have power to call into consultation agricultural and educational experts 
outside the two departments. 
6. That the local administration of rural education should be intrusted to 
the county education authorities, acting through or after consultation with a 
special agricultural committee or a subcommittee of the education committee 
in each county, including representatives of the local agricultural societies 
and of any institutions for higher agricultural education connected with the 
county. 
7. That in order to improve our present system of agricultural instruction, 
largely increased funds should be appropriated by Parliament, and should be 
allocated on the recommendation of the interdepartmental committee, regard 
being had to the work done in the various institutions and the amount of local 
funds forthcoming from the several counties and districts,

EDUCATION IN ENGLAND. 875 
The representative character of the conference gives great signifi- 
cance to the scheme of agricultural education and the system of 
administration outlined in the foregoing resolutions. They indicate 
also the character of the agencies already at work in England in this 
particular field. 
The interest of the local authorities in the special needs of rural 
schools has been seconded or stimulated by the board of education, 
which has recently issued several important publications on the sub- 
ject.¢ In their report for 1907-8 the board states that the tendency to 
adapt rural education to the needs of rural life is a growing one. As 
illustrating the bearing of this tendency they cite the example of 
Lindsey, one of the eastern counties where a rural education sub- 
committee has been appointed to advise on the subject. The report 
says: 
In this district the demand for small holdings under the recent act has been 
active, and it is satisfactory that the authority should have recognized in this 
way the important place that must be given to education preparatory to rural 
life if small holdings are to be successful. 
MEASURES AFFECTING TEACHERS. 
THE STAFFING OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 
The direct control of elementary schools in England is intrusted to 
boards of managers. The law of 1902 requires that— 
the managers of the school shall carry out any directions of the local education 
authority as to the secular instruction to be given in the school, including any 
directions with respect to the number and educational qualifications of the 
teachers to be employed for such instruction, and for the dismissal of any 
teacher on educational grounds, and if the managers fail to carry out any such 
direction the local education authority shall, in addition to their other powers, 
have the power themselves to carry out the direction in question as if they were 
the managers. 
The local authorities are, in turn, limited in the matter by the 
requirements of the board of education. These relate to the pro- 
fessional qualifications and to the proportion of teachers of each 
specified class to the number of pupils in the school. During the 
present year changes have been made in the requirements of the 
board, looking to the reduction of the number of scholars for which 
teachers will count upon the staff, the reduction of the size of classes 
and the elevation of the standards of the service.” 
The following statement shows the most important modifications 
of the former regulations and also the classes of teachers recognized 
in the school staff.

embodied in the code of regulations for public elementary schools, 1909.

> Pupil-teachers ceased to be recognized July 31, 1909. 
It is further set forth in the circular that— 
no organization of a school will be permitted, even temporarily, under which 
all the classes contain as many as 60 children, and the size of the upper Classes, 
in particular, should be graded from 50 to 45, or 40 children, respectively. 
Moreover, no organization of the school will be permitted under which a greater 
number of children is assigned to any teacher than his personal attainments 
and experience qualify him to teach, and for this purpose the organization of 
the school in respect of “the qualification of each member of the staff and his 
suitability for the work assigned to him” will receive special attention from 
the board and their inspectors. 
The new arrangements have excited some opposition, both on the 
ground of their interference with the organization of schools and the 
increased expenditure which they necessitate. But, on the other 
hand, they are heartily supported by teachers and school officers in all 
progressive communities. Mr. Runciman, referring to the matter in 
his speech on the budget estimates for 1910, made the following 
statement: 
The standard which I have set up is not a fantastic standard evolved out of 
my head or created by educational enthusiasts, but it is a standard which is 
surpassed by many of the educational authorities in this country. * * * The 
good authorities have set an excellent example, and in particular I may name 
the county authorities of Wales. They set an excellent example, and previous 
to the circular they realized that they must have the best teachers and the 
smallest number in the classes if the schools were to be worth the enthusiasm 
expended on them. In Wales, I believe, there is only one, or there may possibly 
be two, counties which fall below this standard.* 
RECENT CHANGES IN TRAINING COLLEGES FOR TEACHERS. 
Training colleges for teachers, or normal schools, were established 
by private societies in England a half century before the passage 
of the education act of 1870, and as early as 1843 they received 
government grants. These private, residential colleges, which are

with few exceptions denominational, are still the main provision for 
training teachers. In 1890 the Government agreed to recognize day 
training colleges, which were a logical outcome of the establishment 
of elementary schools under public auspices, and which, for the same 
reasons, were undenominational. In 1904 a parliamentary grant 
equivalent to 25 per cent of the total cost was offered toward the 
building of local authority training colleges. This year it is pro- 
posed to raise this grant to 75 per cent of the cost, or to provide 75 
per cent of the current expenditure to local authorities who them- 
selves bear the initial cost of training colleges. 
While provision has been made for increasing the number of 
training colleges, measures have been taken to break up the denomi- 
national restrictions of the older residential colleges. As will be 
seen by reference to Table 6, 33 out of a total of 74 colleges belong 
to the Church of England, and these comprise 38 per cent of the 
total accommodation in institutions of this class. Until recently 
admission to the church schools was limited to members of the 
denomination. The regulations for 1908 provided that training col- 
leges in receipt of public grants should give access to half their 
places without denominational tests. The condition was renewed for 
the current year. In future no new training college can be estab- 
lished unless it is free from denominational instructions. Accord- 
ing to the latest estimates this action secures about 9,000 places for 
free competition on a total of 12,000. 
The regulations for the current year included a clause making 
religious instruction compulsory in all training colleges. Public 
announcement of the withdrawal of this clause was made within a 
fortnight from its publication. In explanation of this sudden rever- 
sal of official action, Mr. Runciman said: 
I quite recognize that it is very difficult to fly in the face of public opinion, 
and I am not prepared to add to the trouble which already surrounds my 
office if I can avoid it. * * * I have therefore decided not to put the 
regulations into operation. 
It is interesting to note that among the many grounds of opposi- 
tion to the clause, the one which counted most toward the final result 
was the objection of local authorities to having the obligation forced 
upon them.* 
EXTENSION OF THE SYSTEM OF STATE-AIDED EDUCATION. 
The measures thus far considered relate particularly to elementary 
schools. But the year has been marked, also, by continued activity 
in respect to duties arising from the recent extension of the system

of education. These extensions are both social and scholastic in their 
nature. To the former belong measures for promoting the physical 
well-being of children in order that they may be able to benefit by the 
free instruction provided. By an act of 1906, which went into effect 
July 31, 1908, local authorities, with the approval of the board of 
education, may supply food to necessitous school children at the ex- 
pense of the local taxes. During the year 51 authorities have availed 
themselves of this privilege. 
Medical inspection of schools was provided for by the education 
(administrative provisions) act of 1907, which became effective Janu- 
ary 1, 1908. Several important circulars have been issued by the 
board of education for the guidance of local authorities in this mat- 
ter, and the service, which hitherto has been limited to the chief 
cities of England, is now being rapidly organized throughout the 
country. 
Open-air schools for children physically infirm have been provided 
by the education authorities of London, Bradford, Norwich, and a 
few other boroughs, and have been recognized for government grants 
under the provisions of the education act for defective and epileptic 
children, 1899.     
   
         
   
    
   
                                          
   SCHOLASTIC EXTENSION OF THE SYSTEM. 
The provisions of the law of 1902 with regard to “higher educa- 
tion” have entailed a vast preliminary work of investigation and 
advice from which definite policies are gradually taking shape. The 
chief responsibility in this matter rests with the local authorities. 
They determine the needs of their respective areas and levy local 
taxes for a large part of the funds to meet these needs. But in order 
to obtain government aid, they must comply with specified conditions 
and hence the classification of institutions and their scholastic stand- 
ards are largely determined by the board of education.* It is the 
present purpose of the board as stated by the president, Mr. Runci- 
man— 
to generalize secondary education, and so far as it comes under the control of 
the board to make technical education more practical, and to have a closer 
bearing on the duties likely to be performed by the young men and women who 
pass through these classes. * * * The attempt to grade classes has been 
done with the object of providing three sets of pupils passing from the elementary 
and other schools. There is, first of all, the set of pupils leaving school at 
13 or 14 years of age who have completely finished their day-school career, and 
who, whatever education they receive after that, are bound, in the circum- 
stances of their working life, to take it in evening classes. There is the second 
set who leave the secondary school at the age of 16, spending a longer period 
of their school life in day schools, and are able to take advantage of technical 
classes later on with an entirely different equipment. They are, indeed, on a

  EDUCATION IN ENGLAND. 879 
different plane from those attending the evening classes on continuation work. 
Then, last of all, we have to provide for a.third category, namely, those who 
are going to pass through a university course, and are able to devote time to 
day work up to the ages of 19 or 20. 
With respect to technical classes, Mr. Runciman, after noting the 
distinction between urban and rural conditions, continues: 
In the urban areas not only have we provided for men, but we have special- 
ized classes for women, and I hope that in the next two or three years it will 
become apparent that the classes for women are well worthy of the attention 
of working women in the great towns of the south of England as well as in 
the north of England. In agriculture we have not been able to make great 
progress, but there is one remarkable fact which is worth mentioning, namely, 
that garden classes in elementary schools have been enormously on the increase, 
~ and I believe that during the last few years we have trebled the number of these 
classes which are now carried on in these schools. There has been considerable 
development—and I can assure the committee that there will be more in future— 
in technical classes which can be attended by those who intend to enter on an 
agricultural career—young farmers and young laborers who at the present 
time have to spend long and laborious days in the fields or farm houses, but 
who are prepared to devote one or two evenings a week to the specialized train- 
ing which can be provided in our technical classes. The cumulative effect of all 
this technical training on the young men and women of our country must show 
itself sooner or later. 
Certainly we are touching the problem of the unemployable, if only to a small 
extent, yet with increasing vigor every year. The great employers have been 
giving considerable help in many parts of the country to those who organize the 
technical schools. Messenger boys, for instance, are induced more and more to 
take advantage of the classes in the evening. Some great employers, like the 
general post-office, not only give direct inducement to their messenger boys, but 
put a certain amount of pressure on them to take advantage of our classes, and 
many employers all over the country have made it a condition of service in 
their works or their great business establishments that the boys should attend 
a certain number of classes every week, and apprentices in works have also 
been able to take advantage of the facilities offered to them. Many employers, 
especially in the north of England, are allowing their young workmen time off 
during working hours so that they can attend these day classes conducted in 
the great technical institutions of our great towns. The inspectors of the board 
are not only taking a keen interest in the curriculum, but they are also acting 
as missionaries in what is one of the most useful forms of educational work 
initiated during the last few years.% 
The most serious criticism of the course pursued by the Government 
in the endeavor to extend the provision for secondary education re- 
lates to the division of pupils on social lines. As expressed by a 
member of the House— 
There is one lamentable consequence of this parallel ladder—the elementary 
ladder side by side with the secondary ladder. The secondary ladder standing 
side by side tends to generate class distinction between elementary education and 
secondary education. The old Scottish practice, whereby the laird’s son and 
the farmer’s son, and even the laborer’s son, learned their lessons in the same

class room, is on the way to get out of sight when elementary and secondary 
education are, so to speak, in water-tight compartments. 
The member quoted with approval a criticism of the same tenor 
from the Journal of Education to the effect that this sort of dis- 
tinction— 
undoubtedly stamps secondary education as the privilege of those classes of the 
community which are rich enough to forego the use of the public elementary 
schools, 
The success of the Government’s efforts for stimulating and regu- 
lating secondary education is indicated by the number of schools 
which come into relations with the board, this being a voluntary action 
on their part. (See Table 7.) 
The secondary schools referred to are not free schools, but they 
are made accessible to poor children of unusual ability by the scholar- 
ship system. One condition of the government grant to a secondary 
school is that 25 per cent of the places shall be open to nonpaying 
pupils. In 1907 no less than 27,000 working-class children took 
advantage of the privilege then offered. That number went up to 
33,000 in the next year, and this year the number is very nearly 
42,000. Every one of those children obtains a secondary education 
free of cost to himself. Mr. Runciman observes that— 
the provision of secondary school places has to some extent placed a burden 
on secondary schools in the country. Accordingly the proportion of only 25 
per cent will not be the measure of the proportion of free-place children in 
these schools after three or four years have passed away. But we have made up 
for the heavy expenditure by giving very much larger grants than we have ever 
before offered. 
DISCUSSIONS OF CURRICULA. 
The conditions that have made it necessary to increase and equalize 
the provision for secondary education in England have also created 
a demand for readjustments of curricula and programmes. The 
municipal secondary schools and the provincial universities that have 
been created during the last twenty years have been amply equipped 
as regards both men and implements for instruction in science; hence 
the meagerness of such provision in other parts of the country has 
been the more apparent. It is the province of the board of educa- 
tion to survey the whole domain with the view not only of equalizing 
opportunities, but also with a view of formulating well-balanced 
courses of instruction. The current activities of the board in the lat- 
ter respect are illustrated by the regulations for secondary schools, 
and by several publications treating of specific branches of study. 
Among the latter is a report on science teaching in public schools 
embodying the results of an inquiry conducted by the association 
of public-school science masters, acting in consultation with the 
director of special inquiries and reports, for the board of education.
-P-A-G-E-393
EDUCATION IN ENGLAND. 381 
Of 71 schools to which the inquiry was addressed, 46 responded, 
including the oldest and most famous secondary schools of England. 
Several of these institutions, namely, Charterhouse, Cheltenham, 
Clifton, and Rugby accompany their replies by a history of the de- 
velopment of their science departments. In this respect these insti- 
tutions are typical, and although, as the editor of the report observes, 
“the mere historical: statement conveys very little idea of the condi- 
tions under which much of the earlier teaching was conducted,” it 
does serve to emphasize the remarkable progress that has been made 
in the conception and method of scientific instruction. 
The influences mentioned in the report as having “ revolutionized 
the science teaching ” in the class of schools considered are the ever- 
increasing importance attached to science subjects in examinations 
conducted by the universities; the influence of two “reformers,” 
Profs. H. E. Armstrong and L. C. Miall, the first in the realms of 
physics and chemistry, the second in that of biology; and the inclu- 
sion of science on terms more favorable than previously in the exami- 
nations necessary for admission to the army. 
The report gives full summaries of the replies to the “ question- 
naire,” which called for particulars as to the organization and equip- 
ment of the school, the subjects covered by the science side, the full 
programme, expenses, etc. Particular value attaches to an appendix 
comprising six different schedules of science work, covering the 
courses in physics and chemistry followed in five schools from which 
complete returns were received, and two courses in biological subjects. 
Among other recent publications of the government board, pertain- 
ing to secondary education, is a circular on the pronunciation of 
Latin, embodying the recommendations of the Classical Association 
supported by the philological societies of Oxford and Cambridge, 
the head mas*ers’ conference, and associations of masters and assist- 
ant masters of secondary schools. These recommendations are di- 
rected to a reform of the varied practices of the schools in respect 
to the pronunciation of Latin, by the uniform adoption of what was 
presumably the Roman method. 
The board of education has also issued a memorandum dealing 
with the teaching of modern languages in state-aided schools which, 
among, other considerations, urges the importance of the German 
language. The subject was brought to the attention of the board 
by the Modern Language Association, the commercial education com- 
mittee of the London Chamber of Commerce, and other representa- 
tive bodies. 
In this connection it may be noted that a joint committee repre- 
senting the Classical Association, the Modern Language Association, 
the English Association, the Incorporated Association of Head Mas- 
ters, the Association of Head Mistresses, the Incorporated Associa- 
 
-P-A-G-E-394
    
882 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
tion of Assistant Masters, and the Incorporated Association of As- 
sistant Mistresses was formed during the year, with a view to draw- 
ing up and submitting to the associations concerned a scheme for 
a simplified and consistent grammatical terminology, tending in 
the direction of uniformity in all the languages taught in schools. 
The current interest in the general question of studies, their se- 
quence and conduct, has been intensified by discussions of the report 
of a committee appointed by the British Association for the Ad- 
vancement of Science to consider and advise as to the curricula of 
secondary schools. The report of the committee was submitted at 
the annual meeting of the association held in Dublin September, 1908. 
The tendency of government regulations is to promote uniformity 
in curriculum and methods, a result at variance with the freedom 
and spontaneity that have long characterized the secondary schools 
of England. It is admitted, however, even by the strongest advo- 
cates of classical training, that the courses of instruction and the 
methods of the “ public schools,” i. ¢., endowed secondary schools, 
ought to be brought into closer relation with “ contemporary life and 
thought.” ‘The aroused interest of leading school men, the critical 
scrutiny of government measures and the vigorous discussion of the 
entire subject of secondary curricula and methods now going on in 
England are among the most important outcomes of the enlarged 
functions of the board of education. 
EXPENDITURE FOR PUBLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 
The expenditure for public elementary schools is met from parlia- 
mentary grants and rates (local property taxes) to which, in the 
case of nonprovided schools, are added private bequests, subscrip- 
tions, etc. The total current expenditure for elementary education 
for 1906-7, the last year for which the item was *reported, was 
£21,162,353 ($102,809,035). Of this amount, as shown in Table 9, 
the grants supplied 53.7 per cent; rates, 44.8 per cent; leaving a small 
balance to be supplied from other local sources. 
In addition to the current expenditure there are capital expendi- 
tures to be met, principally the repayment of loans effected for the 
purchase of school sites and the cost of buildings. For the year 
referred to these capital expenditures amounted to about £3,500,000 
($17,500,000). As this is an expense to be met entirely from the 
rates, it increases materially the proportion of the annual amount 
spent for elementary education which falls upon the local authorities. 
The ever-increasing burden upon the rates for the service of educa- 
tion excites complaint even from the rich boroughs. The expansions 
of the system already referred to have added to the burden, and the
-P-A-G-E-395

ery is general that since the Government sets the pace, it should bear 
the larger share of the increased cost. 
It is pointed out, also, that on account of the mode of distributing ~ 
the grants, having no regard either to the amounts raised locally or 
to differences in the assessable value of land, glaring inequalities and 
anomalies are fostered. The chairman of the Liverpool education 
committee, in a recent discussion of this subject, said: 
The system does not differentiate between high and low rated communities, 
places where the cost of building and maintenance is high and not helped. 
Comparative efficiency, as evidenced by increased cost per child of teaching and 
maintenance, is disregarded, with the result that a ratepayer who provides the 
best may receive less and have to pay more in rates than another who provides 
the worst. 
The average cost of education per scholar in Liverpool is £4 13s. 1d., in 
Manchester £4 18s. 10d., in Sheffield £3 15s. 6d., in Bradford £5 10s. 2d., and in 
Whitehaven it is £2 4s. The rate is 153d. in the pound in Birkenhead, 174d. in 
Leeds, 164d. in Liverpool, 154d. in Manchester, 6d. in Southport, 73d. in White- 
haven. Hach place received practically the same grant per scholar. 
The report of the departmental committee on education rates notes 
in particular the great variations in expenditure in the different 
areas. Their investigation showed that— 
the highest expenditure per child in average attendance in 1904-5, according to 
the figures received, was 134s. at Hornsey, and the lowest about 40s., in White- 
haven, a difference of over £4 14s. per child. While the expenditure in towns 
such as Preston, St. Helens, and Warrington ranges from 47s. 10d. to 58s. 8d. 
per child, the expenditure in some other industrial areas of about equal popu- 
lation is from half as much again to nearly double that in the towns named. 
In the conference above referred to, Lord Stanley, of Alderley, 
after a detailed analysis of the situation, urged the appointment of 
a commission “to inquire into the incidence of the cost of education, 
local and imperial, for the whole United Kingdom.” He said: 
It is certainly essential that throughout the United Kingdom a very large 
share of the cost should be borne locally. We desire public local management; 
and a centralized bureaucratic system of education would be most mischievous 
and hostile to progress. 
‘We must call everywhere for local contributions bearing a definite relation 
to state aid, and that local contribution must be associated with local public 
representation and management. It is, however, imperative that any new 
demands on local authorities put forward by the board of education should be 
accompanied by a corresponding parliamentary grant equal to one-half of the 
additional cost. Thus such new demands as medical inspection, feeding of 
children, maintenance of industrial schools, should not be valid unless accom- 
panied by a grant of half the cost. This would make the board of education 
more chary of making new demands, regardless of the means of the local 
authority.

RECENT INVESTIGATIONS.     
  REPORT OF THE INTERDEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEE ON PARTIAL EXEMP- 
TION FROM SCHOOL ATTENDANCE. 
The legal provision for partial exemption from school attendance 
is peculiar to the British systems of elementary education, but the 
circumstances that have brought it about and its operations relate 
to the subject of the larger problem of child labor, which engages 
attention in all civilized countries; hence the methods and results of 
this inquiry of the committee above named have a universal interest.
-P-A-G-E-399
     EDUCATION IN ENGLAND. 387 
The thoroughness with which the investigation was carried out is 
indicated by the following statement of the committee: 
In the course of our inquiry we have held 16 meetings, at which we have 
examined 52 witnesses, including representatives of chambers of commerce and 
agriculture, of associations of employers and of trade unions, officials of the 
home office, of the board of education, and of local education authorities, 
members of the consultative committee of the board of education, certifying 
factory surgeons, school-teachers, farmers, and private persons whose opinions 
Seemed to us likely to be of value. 
Our thanks are due to local education authorities for the readiness with 
which they responded to our requests for returns in regard to various points 
upon which, in the course of our inquiry, we felt ourselves in need of more 
definite information than we possessed. 
The committee on wage-earning children furnished us not only with the 
names of several useful witnesses, but with memoranda containing much 
valuable information prepared by teachers and others who had given their 
special attention to the question of partial exemption. 
By the courtesy of mill owners, members of the committee were enabled 
to view several cotton, worsted, and silk mills, to see the children actually at 
work, and to discuss the question of half-time employment on the spot with 
employers, mill managers, and overlookers. 
As to the present extent of partial exemption the committee re- 
ports that the system— 
chiefly prevails in Lancashire, where it is largely availed of for employment in 
the cotton mills; in Yorkshire, where worsted spinning and weaving are the 
staple industry, and in a few counties for agricultural purposes. It is not by 
any means the case that in all the areas where partial-exemption regulations 
exist the population care to avail themselves of them. 
We have obtained as accurate figures as possible from the various authorities 
as to the number of partial-exemption scholars. From the returns so compiled 
it appears that the average number of partial-exemption scholars during the 
year 1906-7 was 47,360, of whom 34,306 were employed in factories. Of those 
employed in factories, 20,302 are found in Lancashire, where it may be assumed 
that the great majority are employed in cotton mills; 10,517 are found in 
Yorkshire, where it may be assumed that they are mostly engaged in some 
branch of the worsted manufacture. The number of children obtaining partial 
exemption for the purpose of employment in agriculture was 3,800. There 
remained 9,254 children employed in other occupations, The great majority 
of the boys in this class were employed as errand boys by tradesmen of all 
descriptions, and of the girls, as domestic helps, principally in their own homes. 
The rest of-the occupations were of a most miscellaneous character. For exam- 
ple, we find a few children employed as donkey boys, carters’ boys, milk boys, 
golf caddies, and hawkers; others were engaged in dairy work, dressmaking, 
tailoring, rag sorting, hurdle making, and sea fishing. 
It is to be further remarked that our statistics show that where half time 
is not already the custom of the district for textile or agricultural purposes, it is 
utilized very little for any subordinate industry or for domestic purposes. Thus 
there are many of the chief towns of England which have made no half-time 
by-laws at all; e. g., London, Birmingham, Plymouth, Newcastle, Lincoln, and 
York. There are also many towns where half-time regulations have been made, 
    
-P-A-G-E-400
   
    388 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
put where, because children are not required in the principal industries, it is not 
the custom for them to leave school, and they are therefore not employed in 
other industries. Examples of this are to be found in Bristol, Manchester, 
West Hartlepool, Bournemouth, Norwich, Portsmouth, Hanley, and Wolver- 
hampton. Where, on the other hand, half timers are employed in the staple 
industries of the town we find also a large number of partial-exemption scholars 
engaged in all kinds of miscellaneous occupations. For instance, in Bradford 
there were 326 half timers other than those in textile employment in 1906-7, 
while in Leeds, with nearly twice the child population of Bradford, but where 
there is no textile half time, there were only 13 nontextile half timers. In 
Lancashire it may be interesting to compare Oldham, with 215 nontextile half 
timers, and Warrington, where the employers agreed eight or nine years ago to 
employ no factory half-time labor and where, consequently, there is not a single 
partial-exemption scholar, though the by-law for partial exemption still remains 
in force. The problem, therefore, with which we have to deal may be said 
to be confined to certain parts of the textile industries, localized chiefly in 
Yorkshire, Lancashire, and Cheshire, and to certain counties where at present 
there are partial-exemption provisions in force for agricultural purposes. (Cited 
from School Government Chronicle, No. 2008, Vol. LXXXII, August 7, 1909.) 
Having dealt in detail with existing laws regulating exemption 
from school attendance, and the extent to which partial exemption 
prevails, the committee consider the objections to the system. They 
state— 
that the opinion of the teachers in the schools is practically unanimous in de- 
siring the cessation of the system of partial exemption in all its forms. The 
objections taken in the evidence given before us are that the time, attention, 
and interest of the children who go as-half timers are divided between the mill 
and the school, and as a consequence they are unable to continue to pay proper 
attention to their school work. Their progress is retarded, if not absolutely 
brought to a standstill. The children come to school tired and sleepy. The 
organization of any school in which there are half timers suffers considerably. 
Arrangements have to be made for teaching in the same class children who 
attend the whole week and children who are only attending half. The full-time 
child frequently may receive two hours’ instruction in a given subject, while 
the half timer can only attend one hour’s teaching per week in the same subject. 
The result is obviously detrimental to the half-time child, who loses a large 
part of his education. If the half timers are a small minority of the class, they 
tend to be neglected and left behind the others. If, on the other hand, they are 
numerous, the teacher has necessarily to give them special attention while they 
are in the school. The consequence is that the full timers suffer in their turn, 
for the whole class tends to have its pace reduced to the pace of the slower 
ensiteoi sss e 
In this connection it should be noticed that the actual number of hours 
during which the half timer is employed during the day in the mill and school 
together are greatly more than the school hours of the full-time scholar. Dur- 
ing the week, when the child attends the mill in the morning, it spends thirty 
hours in the factory and twelve and a half in the school, and during the week 
when it attends the school in the morning, it spends twenty-five and a half 
hours in the factory and fifteen in the school. On an average, therefore, of a 
fortnight’s work, the half-time child has been engaged at work and school    
-P-A-G-E-401
  EDUCATION IN ENGLAND. 3889 
together for half as much again in actual hours as the full-time scholar. And 
when the child goes to the mill in the morning it has by the time it begins to 
attend school in the afternoon already worked for as long in the mill as the 
total school hours of a full-time child. It is not surprising that the teachers 
find that the faculties of the half-time children often require rest rather than 
exercise in the afternoon school. The educational loss of the half timer may 
be gauged by the small extent to which he takes advantage of opportunities 
for further education which offer themselves to children leaving public ele- 
mentary schools. Throughout Yorkshire and Lancashire there now exists many 
secondary schools with a large number of free places which can be obtained by 
public elementary school scholars with the necessary equipment, and in most of 
the large towns there are now systems of graded continuation schools, open for 
small fees to the working-class population. But secondary education is practi- 
cally closed to the half timer. 
The injurious effects of the half-time system on the moral character 
and the health of the children are forcibly presented, and the report 
then proceeds to deal with the argument for the system on the ground 
of necessity. The cases of many industrial towns, notably Hudders- 
field and Glasgow, where the half-time system has been discontinued, 
lead the committee to conclude that— 
the main obstacle, however, to the disappearance of half time is the custom of 
the textile districts. The children themselves like going to the mills. At first, 
at any rate, they enjoy the sense of becoming grown up and independent, and of 
having money to spend. We were not surprised to hear of a case where out of 
800 children questioned only 7 replied that they would have preferred not to have 
gone to the mill. The regrets come later, when the young person of 18 or 20 
begins to miss the schooling that might have led to a better position in life and 
better wages in the long run, 
The committee declares, also— 
that though there are cases where the half-time wage may save a family from 
serious distress or application for poor relief, such cases are not very numerous, 
and are certainly not the main reason for the continuance of half time. The 
wages earned by the half timers are never very considerable; in many cases in 
the cotton trade no payment is made for some weeks, and in some cases months. 
The outcome of the investigation so far as regards the work of the 
committee is embodied in the following recommendations: 
(1) That all partial exemption be abolished from a date not earlier than 
January 1, 1911. 
(2) That at the same time total exemption under the age of 13 be abolished. 
(3) That the attendance certificate for total exemption be abolished. 
(4) That total exemption at the age of 13 be granted only for the purposes of 
beneficial or necessary employment. 
(5) That the ordinary condition for total exemption be due attendance at a 
continuation class, but 
(6) That, subject to the approval of the board of education, an authority 
may adopt as an alternative condition the passing of a standard not lower than 
Standard VI.

  390 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
REPORT OF THE CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE ON ATTENDANCE, COMPULSORY 
OR OTHERWISE, AT CONTINUATION SCHOOLS. 
The report of the consultative committee on attendance at continua- 
tion schools covers, in part, the same ground as the previous inquiry, 
and affords striking confirmation of its disclosures and conclusions. 
The committee ascertained that about three-fifths of the population 
of England and Wales live in areas where no child under 14 years of 
age is wholly released from school attendance before he or she has 
reached the seventh standard. They estimate that out of 211,000 
children between the ages of 12 and 14 who have left the day school, 
there are 171,000 children not attending any school; out of 2,022,000 
children between the ages of 14 and 17 there are 1,750,000 who are 
not under any form of instruction. 
The decay of the old system of apprenticeship and the increasing 
influence of scientific knowledge upon trade conditions require more 
knowledge for success, yet the committee find that the conditions for 
obtaining this knowledge are harder. “At best,” they say, “a boy 
obtains by practical experience a certain skill in one branch of trade. 
At worst he is set to purely mechanical work, for which little or no 
skill or thought is required, and under the monotony of which his 
faculties, moral no less than mental, often fail to develop.” Under 
present conditions the years between 13 and 17 are years of waste. 
In this connection the committee say: 
Education as a sheath, protecting boys and girls during adolescence against 
tendencies to injurious forms of employment, is much needed in this country. 
The point of danger, which used to occur in childhood, has now been largely 
transferred to adolescence. There is peril at the close of the day school course, 
and peril again at the age of 17 or 18, when the passage should be made to 
adult skilled employment. The first danger can only be met by the prolonga- 
tion of educational care throughout adolescence. The second danger can only 
be met by the provision of technical classes in which younger work people of 
both sexes may acquire, during the years of adolescent employment, the skill 
needed to qualify them for well-paid adult occupation. 
Among the practical conclusions embodied in the recommendations 
of the committee having special reference to the conditions above 
referred to, the following are particularly suggestive: 
The education given in the day school should be improved by reducing the 
size of classes, by increasing the proportion of qualified teachers, and by intro- 
ducing more manual work (including domestic subjects in the case of girls), 
and by improving the regularity of attendance; further, the day school period 
should at once be extended both in town and country by the abolition (except, 
as stated below, in individual cases) of any form of whole-time or half-time 
exemption from school attendance under the age of 138. After a short interval 
all exemptions from day school attendance should be forbidden, except as stated 
below, to children under 14 years of age. * * * 
In rural districts the local education authority should have the option of 
allowing girls whose assistance is required at home for part of the day to
-P-A-G-E-403
  EDUCATION IN ENGLAND. 391 
attend the day school half time from 13 to 15 instead of whole time up to 14, 
but only for the sake of home duties and not for wage-earning work, and only 
where properly organized instruction can be given to such girls. * * * 
Exemption from full-time attendance at the day school in the case of boys 
and girls under 16 years of age should only be allowed when the parents or 
guardians can show that the children in question are to be suitably employed, 
and while they continue to be so employed. It might be necessary to arrange 
special classes for the pupils thus retained at school or recalled after an 
interval of outside employment. * * * 
It will be very desirable to interest the day-school teacher in the work of the 
continuation school, and it will often be necessary to employ them in giving in- 
struction there. It will also be advantageous to provide that head teachers in 
the day schools shall be able to take part in the direction of the continuation 
school or group of continuation schools to which their pupils go. Care must be 
taken, however, to prevent overstrain in the case of teachers who teach both in 
day and evening schools. i 
Local education authorities should establish classes in which persons who 
are already teachers should be trained in the more specialized parts of the work 
of the continuation school and in which experts in such subjects may be trained 
in the art of teaching. 
In order to promote voluntary attendance upon continuation 
schools the committee recommend— 
effective encouragement from employers of labor, systematic visitation of the 
parents of children who are about to leave the day school, the personal influence 
of the day-school teacher, propaganda among work people, close cooperation on 
the part of the local education authority with the managers of boys’ and girls’ 
clubs and other voluntary agencies, the better adjustment of the courses of 
instruction to the needs of local industries, and the provision of systematic 
classes in history, literature, and economics for adult students, 
and the payment of grants to children as an encouragement to them 
to attend. 
It is further recommended that— 
it should be the statutory duty of the local education authority of each county 
and county borough to make suitable provision of continuation classes for the 
further education of young persons resident in their district from the time they 
leave the day school up to their seventeenth birthday, and to keep a register of 
all such young persons, with a record of their occupations. 
It should be lawful for the education authority of any county or county 
borough to make by-laws (subject to confirmation by the board of education) 
requiring the attendance at continuation classes to an age to be fixed by the 
by-laws, but not exceeding 17 years, of any young persons resident or working 
in their district who are not otherwise receiving a suitable education. 
As a means of giving effect to the last recommendation, it 
should be— 
the statutory duty of every employer of any young person under 17 years of 
age (@) to enable him or her to attend continuation classes for such period 
of time and at such hours as may be required by the by-laws of the local edu- 
cation authority of the district in which such young person either works or 
resides, and (b) to supply the names of all such young persons to the local 
authority on demand. * * * 
 
-P-A-G-E-404
  892 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
As regards curriculum, the continuation schools should give effective training 
for the duties of citizenship and should have reference to the crafts and indus- 
tries practiced in the district, including agriculture, when practiced, and the 
domestic arts. Prominence should be given to practical and manual instruction 
in the courses, but the claims of general education should not be disregarded. 
On every ground the course of instruction should also include systematic phys- 
ical training. 
For the planning of courses of instruction, and for their periodical adjust- 
ment to the needs of the district, local education authorities should establish 
advisory committees, including representatives of the employees and work people 
in each calling and of persons experienced in teaching. 
It deserves consideration whether, in view of the cost of a fully organized 
system of continuation classes, and of the national character of the work, 
government grants for continuation schools might not be paid on a higher scale 
to those local education authorities which adopted by-laws prescribing com- 
pulsory attendance. 
REPORTS OF THE POOR-LAW COMMISSION AND THE ROYAL COMMISSION ON 
THE FEEBLE-MINDED. 
The purpose of the Government to bring the entire child popula- 
tion under proper supervision and care is indicated by the work of 
the recently appointed poor-law commission, the results of which 
are set forth in the voluminous report published during the year. 
The great problem before the commission was that of a reform in the 
local administration of the system. But this involves immediately 
the method of dealing with the children who come under the guard- 
ians of the poor and, incidentally, consideration of the means of 
preventing the increase of the pauper classes. 
The commission condemns absolutely the maintenance of pauper 
children in the workhouse and advises that the system of boarding 
out be extended as far as possible, with a wise supervision of such 
children by local women officers under the charge of the local govern- 
ment boards, up to the age of 21. Where this course is practicable, 
the children would be sent to the ordinary elementary school, and 
thus the stigma of pauperism would be obliterated. Where, for any 
reason, this action can not be taken, the commission advises that the 
children be placed in a boarding institution under public supervision. 
It is worthy of note that this commission agrees with the inter- 
departmental committee and the consultative committee in recom- 
mending, as one means of reducing pauperism, the extension of the 
obligatory school period to fifteen years and improved facilities for 
preparing the young for permanent occupations. 
The Report of the Royal Commission on the Care and Control of 
the Feeble-Minded is of interest in this relation chiefly for the evi- 
dence it affords that the uniform organization of the country for the 
purposes of the education acts has become the means of practical 
progress in respect to all matters affecting the welfare of children.
-P-A-G-E-405
    
EDUCATION IN ENGLAND. 393 
The commission recommends new provision for the care of the perma- 
nently feeble-minded and the removal of such from the charge of 
the education authorities. The report discusses the social dangers 
attending the adult life of such children with a comprehensiveness 
that was impossible until the passage of the law of 1889, empowering 
local education authorities to establish special schools for the phys- 
ically and mentally deficient. 
Out of the overwhelming mass of information contained in the 
sreports of the two commissions specified, having reference to children 
who are a charge upon the State, one conclusion stands out with 
marked distinction; namely, the importance of such adjustments of 
the public provision for education as shall meet the capacities and 
conditions of defective children without detriment to the great mass 
of children who are of normal health and capacity.

EDUCATION IN SCOTLAND. 
THE ACT OF 1908. 
The system of public education in Scotland has entered upon an 
era of expansion through the passage of the “ education (Scotland) 
act, 1908,” which received royal assent December 21, 1908. 
The act makes no change in the basis of the system; the parish, 
which may be likened to the district in New England, remains the 
local unit of administration, and the elected school boards retain their 
former powers with considerable extension as regards both elemen- 
tary and secondary education. The additional powers are for the 
most part optional, and hence are likely to be exercised gradually, 
with little disturbance in the usual course of progress. The larger 
boards are already taking steps to meet the new obligations, and there 
is promise of the same order of constructive work which has charac- 
 
-P-A-G-E-407
EDUCATION IN SCOTLAND. 895 - 
terized the past history of the system of public education in the 
principal centers of Scotland. 
The enlarged powers of school boards relate to the general well- 
being of children, to the prolongation of the school life of the young, 
and to the increase of the facilities for secondary education. 
The scope of the authority conferred upon the board under the first 
head is indicated by the following official statement: 
The new act gives school boards considerably enlarged powers for dealing 
with parents who may prove to be neglectful, and insures, as far as legisla- 
tion can, that the sufficient feeding and clothing of the child while at school, 
as well as its physical condition generally, shall receive proper attention, where 
possible, at the hands of its natural guardians, but failing this through other 
agency. At the same time the way is opened for boards to exercise a useful 
influence in guiding and advising as to their future careers in life those young 
people who without this guidance might be content to yield to the easy tempta- 
tion of casual labor. They will also be expected to cooperate with employers 
in endeavoring to secure that the workers of the future shall receive the best 
industrial training it is possible to give in the particular circumstances of each 
case.¢ 
In the interests of children in outlying districts, school boards are 
authorized “ to grant exemption from the obligation to attend school 
to individual children over 12 years of age for such time and upon 
such conditions as to the amount and manner of further attendance 
at school until the age of 14 as the board” may deem fit. 
In respect to the service of medical inspection of pupils the law is, 
in a sense, mandatory, since it not only authorizes school boards to 
maintain such service, but empowers the education department to 
require it. 
The provisions of the law in regard to this service are as follows: 
MEDICAL INSPECTION OF CHILDREN. 
4, A school board may, and where required by the department shall, provide 
for the medical examination and supervision of the pupils attending schools 
within their district to such extent and subject to such requirements as may 
from time to time be prescribed by any code or minute of the department, and 
for the purposes of this section the school board may employ medical officers 
or nurses, or arrange with voluntary agencies for the supply of nurses, and 
provide appliances or other requisites. It shall be a condition of grant to the 
managers of any school within the district of the school board at which there 
is not provision to the satisfaction of the department for the medical examina- 
tion and supervision of the pupils that such managers shall give admission 
and all necessary facilities for the discharge of his duties to any person so 
employed or supplied. 
DEFECTIVE CHILDREN. 
5. It shall be lawful for a school board which makes special provision for 
the education of physically or mentally defective children to require the parents

  396 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909, 
NEGLECTED CHILDREN. 
6. (1) When as the result of medical inspection or otherwise it is brought 
to the notice of a school board that a child attending a school within their dis- 
trict is in a filthy or verminous state, or is unable by reason of lack of food 
or of clothing to take full advantage of the education provided, it shall be the 
duty of the school board, after due warning, to summon either or both of the 
parents or the guardian of such child to appear before them to give an explana- 
tion of the child’s condition; and if the school board shall find that such 
explanation is not forthcoming or is insufficient or unsatisfactory and that the 
condition of the child is due to neglect, they shall transmit a copy of such 
finding to the parent or parents or guardian of the child and to the procurator 
fiscal, and it shall be the duty of the procurator fiscal to institute a prosecution 
under the subsection immediately following. 
(2) Without prejudice to the general operation of the prevention of cruelty 
to children act, 1904, or any act amending the same, neglect to exercise due 
care of a child as aforesaid shall be deemed willful neglect likely to cause the 
child unnecessary suffering within the meaning of such act, punishable sum- 
marily as an offense of cruelty in terms of such act, and subject to the provisions 
thereof as to the committal and custody of the child and otherwise: 
Provided, That if it shall be shown to the satisfaction of the school board, 
or, in the event of a prosecution under such act, of the sheriff, that such parent 
or parents or guardian are unable by reason of poverty or ill health to supply 
sufficient and proper food or clothing for the child, or to give the child the 
necessary personal attention, the school board, if satisfied that the necessities 
of the case will not be provided for by voluntary agency, shall make such pro- 
vision for the child out of the school fund as they deem necessary during such 
period while the child is under obligation to attend school as they may deter- 
mine; but it is hereby provided that any aid given in terms of this section 
shall not deprive such parent or guardian of any franchise, right, or privilege, 
or subject him to any disability: 
Provided, also. That the school board, where they deem it necessary owing 
to the condition of the child, shall have power to make temporary provision for 
the child out of the school fund pending the completion of the procedure hereby 
prescribed, and to recover the cost of such provision from such parent or 
guardian as an alimentary debt, unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the 
school board that such parent or guardian was unable by reason of poverty or 
ill health to supply sufficient and proper food or clothing for the child or to 
give the child the necessary personal attention. 
PROVISION OF AND ATTENDANCE AT CONTINUATION CLASSES. 
As a means of increasing the preparation of the young for the stress 
of industrial life school boards are authorized, at their discretion, 
to require the attendance of youths above 14 years of age (the upper 
limit of legal compulsion) up to the age of 17 years at continuation 
classes, and, moreover, the education department may oblige school 
boards to provide continuation classes. The scope of the continua- 
tion classes is outlined. in the following clause of the law: 
Without prejudice to any other power of a school board to provide instruc- 
tion in continuation classes, it shall be the duty of a school board to make
-P-A-G-E-409
  
EDUCATION IN SCOTLAND. 897 
suitable provision of continuation classes for the further instruction of young 
persons above the age of 14 years with reference to the crafts and industries 
practiced in the district (including agriculture, if so practiced, and the domes- 
tic arts), or to such other crafts and industries as the school board, with the 
consent of the department, may select, and also for their instruction in the Eng- 
lish language and literature, and in Gaelic-speaking districts, if the school board 
So resolve, in the Gaelic language and literature. It shall also be their duty to 
make provision for their instruction in the laws of health and to afford oppor- 
tunity for suitable physical training.—Sec. 10.—(1). 
SUPERANNUATION SCHEME. 
Definite provision is made for retiring allowances for teachers, to 
be provided by treasury grants supplemented by allowances from the 
school boards. Further than this, a national superannuation scheme 
is outlined in the act which places upon the education department 
the duty of formulating a definite plan for giving effect to the propo- 
sition advanced, which plan must, however, be submitted to Parlia- 
ment for approval. 
EDUCATION (SCOTLAND) FUND. 
The financial clauses of the new act provide for the consolidation 
of several funds already available for education, but hitherto inde- 
pendently administered, amounting to about £500,000 ($2,500,000) a 
year. The change in this respect marks the initial stage in the uni- 
fication of what are at present separate parts of a national system 
of education. 
As explained in the official circular above cited— 
the new fund may be utilized to assist the universities, if they can make out 
a good cause for aid, while it will certainly be drawn upon to support the 
great central institutions—technical colleges, colleges of agriculture, schools 
of art, and the like—which have sprung or are springing up in response to 
modern requirements and the benefits of which are not limited to any single 
area, but extend over the country as a whole. Again, in the event of a national 
superannuation scheme for teachers being established, any annual sum that 
may be necessary to secure its financial equilibrium will likewise be regarded 
a first charge. [After these general charges are met, the remainder ig to be 
broken up into district funds, to be distributed with due regard to] the rela- 
tive cost of education and the relative wealth or poverty of the district to which 
the distribution is to be made, as well as of its population. * * * 
[In the application of the district funds] all expenditure on the general 
education service of the district, such as is not properly referable to any one 
school board area, ranks as a first charge. * * * 
Prominent among the first charges on a district fund is that under which 
schools boards, which have established an intermediate or secondary school, 
are to be recouped for such reasonable expenditure as they may have incurred 
in respect of pupils drawn from surrounding parishes. In so far as a school 
of this type is a central school, serving not merely the parish, but the district, 
 
-P-A-G-E-410
    
898 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
in so far will it receive financial assistance from the district fund. A similar 
provision applies to continuation classes of an advanced character, and also 
(under due safeguards) to endowed schools, * * * 
Another first charge of real importance is the establishment of a well- 
articulated bursary scheme, which shall carry pupils not only to the central 
intermediate and secondary schools, but also to technical schools, schools of 
agriculture, etc., and even, if need be, to the universities. Yet another is the 
provision of special teachers whose services can be placed at the disposal of 
school boards for giving instruction in technical subjects, such as agriculture, 
horticulture, physical training, household management, and the like. In the 
case of small rural schools the existence of a staff of traveling teachers of this 
sort should make for both efficiency and economy. In the same connection it 
should be noted that grants may be made from the district fund in aid of 
capital expenditure of a special kind, incurred by any school board within the 
district on the provision of schools or class rooms for physically or mentally 
defective, blind, or deaf-mute children, or of school gardens, laboratories, work- 
shops, or of such other equipment as may be required for the use of the travel- 
ing teachers referred to above, or of similarly qualified teachers appointed and 
paid by the school board itself. * * * 
When the first charges on each district fund have been met the balance is 
to be distributed to the school boards and managers of state-aided schools 
‘within the district, as an addition to the fee grant, that is, in relief of their 
ordinary expenditure. 
Heretofore the state-aided system of education has had chief re- 
gard to children under 14 years of age. As the circular cited sets 
forth— 
this will be so no longer. In many respects the three or four years that im- 
mediately follow the period of compulsory attendance are the most critical in 
a pupil’s life, and for the proper use of these a more clearly defined responsi- 
bility will henceforth rest upon school boards. In future the individual citi- 
zens who undertake this responsibility will find ampler scope for the exercise 
of their administrative talents. The development of secondary and technical 
education under a more elastic system than has up till now been possible, the 
more perfect organization of continuation classes, the selection of young people 
who deserve to be guided, and, where necessary, assisted by bursaries in their 
progress toward the universities or the central institutions for the teaching of 
science, of art, and of agriculture—these are some of the duties that will lie 
to the hands of school board members. Their successful discharge will call 
into play the highest qualities of skill and discretion, [and will bring school 
boards] into more direct and living contact with every element of importance 
in the educational fabric of the country. 
PRESENT CONDITIONS. 
The salient particulars in the system of education which have been 
strengthened and extended by the act above considered are set forth 
in Tables 10-14, appended. Attention is here called to two features 
of the system of special interest at the present time.
-P-A-G-E-411
  
EDUCATION IN SCOTLAND. 399 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
The official report for 1908-92 calls attention to the arrangements 
made by the regulations of 1873 for affording teachers in training 
the advantage of university study and instruction. In 1905 measures 
were adopted for giving the universities a larger share in the train- 
ing of the future teachers of the country, and this relation has been 
further increased by later regulations. The official statistics show 
that the total number of men preparing for the service, i. e., 658, 
were attending training centers in the university towns, and 2,953 
women in a total of 3,220. 
CONTINUATION CLASSES. 
With respect to continuation classes, the need of which is em- 
phasized by the new law, the official report gives the following 
particulars: 
Of the 341 separate bodies of managers responsible for continuation classes 
during the session 1908-9, 305 were school boards. The other local authorities 
recognized for educational purposes included four secondary education com- 
mittees and two county councils. Generous support in aid of continuation 
classes is also given by various other municipalities. 
The number of separate centers shows no sign of increasing. The continua- 
tion class system is now well established and prosperous in the larger towns, 
but in the country districts there is a regrettable instability, many classes spring- 
ing up for one session only to cease the next. This is evidenced by the fact 
that of the 757 centers recognized during 1907-8, 137 centers, representing 61 
separate managing authorities, have dropped out this session. As emphasizing 
further the frail existence of many classes, it is observed that at 43 centers 
where it was proposed to institute classes the proposals fell through, either 
before any actual meetings of these classes or after a trial of a few weeks. 
These results are due to varying circumstances, such as remoteness of district 
and the severities of the weather, but would appear to be in a large measure 
attributable to the lethargy shown by managers and pupils concerning education 
beyond the stage of the day school. 
With a view to meeting the case of classes conducted under difficult condi- 
tions power has been taken in recent codes to grant a shortened session, instead 
of the normal term of twenty weeks, where good reason has been shown for 
such relaxation. The reduced course averages about fifteen weeks. 
The report notices as matter of satisfaction the number of advanced 
classes for commercial and industrial training is increasing, par- 
ticularly in urban districts.

EDUCATION IN IRELAND. 
The year has been marked in Ireland by measures for the organiza- 
tion of the two universities, to be situated, respectively, at Dublin 
and at Belfast, as provided for by the Irish universities act of 1908. 
These universities, it is believed, will exercise an important influence 
on the entire system of public education in Ireland and assist ma- 
terially in bringing about the long-expected unification of its distinct 
divisions. At present the elementary or national schools are the 
charge of a body of national commissioners. The secondary or inter- 
mediate schools have been brought into relations with the interme- 
diate board, which exercises large control over their work by a system 
of examinations for the pupils and of grants to the schools on the 
basis of the results. The two administrative bodies have no relation 
with each other and both operate independently of the universities. 
Even the training colleges for teachers have no relation with the 
higher institutions. 
The department of agriculture and technical instruction, which is 
charged with the administration of the funds for promoting technical 
instruction in Ireland, has taken measures to coordinate its work with 
that of other educational authorities. The instruction fostered by 
the funds of the department is organized under the councils of county 
boroughs, urban districts, and counties, and thus local and central 
forces have all been combined in the furtherance of this important 
department of education in which Ireland has furnished suggestive 
lessons for all other countries.* 
The meeting of the British Association at Dublin, in September of 
last year, naturally was made the occasion for a survey of the educa- 
tional conditions and prospects of the country, and this event, taken

ADMINISTRATION OF THE STATE SYSTEM. 
The system of public instruction in France is at once a political 
instrument and a teaching agency. This dual character must be 
kept in mind in order to follow intelligently the record of any events 
pertaining to the service. 
The head of the system is a cabinet officer, the minister of public instruction 
and fine arts. His control extends also in some measure to private institutions.

406 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909, 
Within the system are comprised the three departments of primary, secondary, 
and superior instruction, each organized under its own chief or director. 
It has been the policy of the Republic to give long tenure to the incumbents 
of these positions, thereby guarding the actual work of education from the evils 
of frequent and capricious change of direction. 
The central administration includes a corps of inspectors-general, who report 
their observations directly to the minister, and the superior council, whose 
functions are advisory and judicial. The council consists of 60 members— 
one-fourth appointed by the President of the Republic and the remainder elected 
by their colleagues (professors and teachers). The term of service in this 
body is four years, but members are often continued for several terms. 
The minister is assisted by a consultative committee—a commission of experts, 
as it were—chosen by himself from the highest officials in the service. 
For local administration, the system is divided into 17 circumscriptions, 
called “academies.” At the head of each academy is a rector, appointed by 
the President of the Republic. The rector is immediately responsible for 
secondary and higher institutions. He is assisted by an advisory council com- 
prising the corps of academic inspectors and representative professors. 
The departments (90 in all, including 3 in Algiers) are civil divisions which 
form within the academies districts for the administration of primary schools. 
The academic inspectors are, virtually, the superintendents of primary educa- 
tion; they are assisted by subinspectors appointed for each department. 
SUMMARIZED STATISTICS. 
According to the latest statistics pertaining to education in France, 
public primary schools, including infant schools, had an enrollment 
in 1907 of 5,106,200 pupils, and the corresponding private schools, 
which are subject to a certain measure of state supervision, an enroll- 
ment of 1,129,980. Omitting the infant schools, the enrollment in 
public primary schools was 4,583,053, and in private primary schools 
1,001,972—that is, 5,585,025 children of legal school age attended 
school some portion of the year. 
The public secondary schools for boys had an enrollment in 1908 of 
96,289 pupils, and the private secondary schools for boys an enroll- 
ment of 64,558. 
The public secondary schools and secondary classes for girls en- 
rolled the same year 34,671 students. The state universities reported 
in January, 1908, an enrollment of 39,890 students. The attendance 
upon other higher institutions dependent upon the ministry of public 
instruction would raise this total to about 41,000. 
For the expenses of the comprehensive system of public, or state, 
education the Government appropriated in 1908 the sum of 271,221,- 
906 francs, equivalent to $54,244,381. Of this amount 3,798,350 
francs, or $759,670, was for the direct expenses of administration, 
including the salaries of the minister and his clerical assistants; 
higher education received about 21,500,000 francs; secondary about

34,000,000. The larger proportion, 212,105,906 francs ($42,421,181), 
equivalent to 78 per cent of the total, was appropriated for the ex- 
penses of primary education.* 
CURRENT ACTIVITIES. 
The current year has been characterized in France by unusual 
activity in regard to education. It is noticeable, also, that this ac- 
tivity has been more marked in respect to purely scholastic problems 
than to those arising from the political relations of the system of 
public instruction which have long been uppermost. 
The legislative contest between church and state, in which the ques- 
tion of the control of education was deeply involved, ceased for a 
time with the passage of the law eliminating the religious orders 
from the work, and the law providing for the separation of church 
and state. It has been recently charged that the clergy are using 
their influence to arouse antagonism to the state schools, and in- 
stances are cited which lend color to the accusation. On the other 
hand, several teachers have been accused of violating the principle 
of religious neutrality by criticisms of church and creed, offensive 
to the consciences of parents and opposed to the moral well-being of 
their children. These local excitements have been raised to national 
importance by the government “ anticlerical bill,” which provides 
that every manifestation publicly made in a church against the school 
shall be deemed an offense, under article 35 of the law of separation. 
The penalty for a clergyman guilty in this manner is imprisonment 
lasting from three months to two years; parents who attack the school 
are subject to a fine of from 11 to 15 francs, and for a second offense 
may be sent to jail for five days. 
The effect of these disquieting incidents is modified by the increas- 
ing force of public opinion as a factor in religious and in political 
affairs. To this end tend the modernist movement in the Catholic 
Church and the increasing number of associations of teachers and 
professors, in which their respective interests are freely discussed. 
The federated associations of elementary teachers have manifested 
their sympathy with the methods of trade unions, and in 1907 were 
drawn into serious controversy with the minister of public instruc- 
tion by the action of their secretary in signing a general protest on 
the part of syndicates (trade unions) against certain measures of the 
Government. The course taken by Minister Briand, in that case, is in 
accord with the programme foreshadowed by M. Clemenceau, when 
  
«The particulars respecting the appropriations for the system of public education and 
the detailed information given under the heads of the several departments of the service 
are derived chiefly from the reports on the budget for 1909, namely: Report to the chamber 
of deputies by M. Steeg, and report to the senate by M. Maurice-Faure.
-P-A-G-E-420
408 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
he became premier. “ As regards professional syndicates,” he said, 
“the Government will propose to you to introduce into the law of 
1884 the improvements which past experience has shown to be neces- 
sary. * * * The Government will submit to you a bill determining 
the status of civil servants. This bill, while granting them liberty of 
combination, and guaranteeing them against arbitrary action, will 
insure the steady accomplishment of their duty to the State, which 
is responsible for the public administrative services.” As a conse- 
quence of the recent strike of the postal and telegraph employees, a 
bill of this kind, defining the rights and duties of officials, and at the 
same time providing for the correction of the wrongs of which they 
justly complain, has been pushed to the front in the Chamber of 
Deputies. As all teachers and professors in the system of public 
instruction belong to the civil service, their interests are involved in 
the measure. 
It is significant that the syndical uprising is regarded by critical 
observers as a democratic protest against the evils of the excessive 
centralization of power under the present parliamentary system. 
The educational movements of chief importance during the year 
have been determined by conditions pertaining to the distinct depart- 
ments of education—primary, secondary, and superior—and may best 
be presented under these separate headings. Even in their technical 
aspects, however, these movements show a common tendency toward 
the freer expression of private and professional opinion, a tendency, 
analagous to that which, in the world of industry, seems to be work- 
ing also toward a readjustment of forces in public and institutional 
life. 
DEPARTMENT OF PRIMARY EDUCATION. 
LAWS CONTROLLING PRIMARY SCHOOLS. 
Primary schools are maintained and controlled in accordance with 
a series of laws pertaining to this division of the general system of 
education. Chief among these is the law of 1833 making it obligatory 
upon the communes to provide a school, either public or subsidized 
private; the law of August 9, 1879, placing upon each department 
the obligation to maintain two primary normal schools, one for men, 
the other for women; the law of June 16, 1881, making primary 
public instruction free; that of March 28, 1882, making instruction 
compulsory for all children of the ages 6 to 13 years; and the law of 
October 30, 1886, determining all details as to the conduct of primary
-P-A-G-E-421
  
EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 409 
schools, and forbidding the future employment of clerical teachers 
in public schools. 
The salaries of teachers, which are paid by the State, and the con- 
ditions of their promotion are regulated by laws of July 19, 1889, 
July 25, 1893, March 1 and December 30, 1903, and April 22, 1905. 
The local school tax is paid into the state treasury; all the obligatory 
expenses of primary schools, except for site and building, are borne 
by state appropriations. 
The law of July 1, 1901, regarding associations, the refusal by 
Parliament in 1902-8 to authorize the continuance of the teaching 
orders, and the law of July 7, 1904, ordering the suppression of all 
the teaching orders within a period of ten years, apply equally to 
the three departments of the system. 
In accordance with recent legislation, teachers belonging to the 
various religious orders have been practically eliminated from the 
public schools. In 1908 only 400 such teachers were still-retained in 
the total force of 115,000. 
As regards private elementary schools, it is reported that between 
July 1, 1901, and June 1, 1908, there were closed by order of the 
Government 16,079 clerical schools; of these, 2,719 were schools for 
boys and 13,360 for girls. There still remained at the last date 
named 94 clerical schools for boys and 1,044 for girls. During the 
period specified (July, 1901, to June, 1908) 2,018 private schools for 
boys and 7,397 private schools for girls were opened. The majority 
of these are former clerical schools transferred to lay managers. 
The distribution of pupils between the various classes of primary 
schools, as shown in Table 2, illustrates the effect of the measures 
referred to.

PROBLEM OF SCHOOL ATTENDANCE. 
In the department of primary education the attention of the Gov- 
ernment during the past year has been directed chiefly to the means 
of enforcing school attendance. In accordance with the law of 
March 28, 1882, which made primary instruction obligatory for all 
children between the ages of 6 and 13, choice of means being left to 
the parents, a local committee is formed in each commune to look 
after the matter of school attendance, and the mayor of the commune, 
who is a member of this committee, is required to notify all parents 
of the date assigned for the opening of the annual school session and 
to warn parents and guardians who violate the compulsory pro- 
visions of the school law. The penalty for such violations is a fine 
ranging from 11 to 15 francs ($2.20 to $3) and imprisonment for 
four or five days. It is admitted that the law is a dead letter in many 
communes, and the number of children not attending school or attend- 
ing irregularly appears to be increasing. The annual examination 
of conscripts and the observation of persons who have occasion to 
sign the civil registers confirm this impression. 
In a circular on the subject addressed to the local inspectors, 
October last, the minister of public instruction states that in 1906 
and 1907 more than 11,000 conscripts were reported as totally illiter- 
ate and 5,000 more who could only read a little. These statistics 
are perhaps not absolutely correct, but they are sufficiently so to 
occasion alarm. They show that while the Republic accomplished 
a great work in reducing the percentage of illiteracy from 17 per 
cent to 4 per cent in twenty-five years, there has been an arrest of 
.progress since 1900. This appears to be due to a residuum of ig- 
norance which can not be reached by the ordinary school provision. 
It comprises the children of the poorest classes, nomads, abnormals 
of all classes, and the inhabitants of isolated regions where families 
are scattered and the means of communication are very bad. In view
-P-A-G-E-423
  EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 411 
of these conditions, a bill is before the legislature dealing with the 
subjects of compulsory school attendance and with the organization 
of the means of popular education beyond the brief period of the 
elementary school. Meanwhile inspectors are directed to use every 
effort to ascertain the extent and causes of neglect of school attend- 
ance in their districts, to inspire teachers with renewed enthusiasm, 
and to induce municipalities to lend moral and material assistance 
in the work.* 
The matter was urged upon the attention of the Chamber of 
Deputies by M. Steeg, chairman of the committee on the budget, 
in submitting the estimates for 1909. With respect to the alarming 
outlook, M. Steeg said: “ While in Germany and in Switzerland 
there is not one illiterate in 200 inhabitants, in France, out of every 
hundred young men, four or five can not read, and out of every 
hundred young women, six or seven are absolutely illiterate. That is, 
the total ignorance is ten times greater than in the neighboring 
countries.” 
There has been no complete school census for several years, so that 
the number of children subject to compulsory education has been 
for some time a matter of conjecture. The minister of public in- 
struction recently ordered a special inquiry upon this point, the 
results of which are shown in Table 3. 
It will be noticed that the total number of children present in the 
public primary schools the day the enumeration was made is nearly 
1,000,000 (exactly 979,789) less than the total enrollment (4,583,053) 
in those schools for the year, as shown in Table 1. This discrepancy 
arises in part from the shifting of pupils, in times of religious agita- 
tions, from public to private schools, and in part from duplications 
in the record of the year’s enrollment. It emphasizes, however, the 
facts brought out in regard to absentees.

@ Manuel Général, December 26, 1908, p. 194. b Consecutive or not. 
The above table brings out many facts of interest relating to the 
primary schools in addition to the particular matter of irregular at- 
tendance. Under this head, as will be seen by reference to column 10, 
it is shown that above 110,000 children were absent from school more 
than half the school session during the year 1907-8. This alone, 
as M. Buisson observes in a comment on the statistics, would suffice 
to explain the persistence of a high proportion of illiterates in the 
country. 
Undoubtedly many causes of truancy and total neglect of school 
attendance would be remedied by an efficient truant service, sup- 
ported by local public opinion throughout the country. But recent 
reports of school inspectors emphasize other causes of delinquency in 
this matter which appeal strongly to humane feelings. The utter 
poverty of many families makes it impossible for the children of 
school age to be clothed and fed, and in many other cases where the 
barest wants of life are met by the continuous toil of both father and 
mother the child of school age must look after the younger children 
in the absence of the parents. The proportion which cases of ab- 
sence from school on account of poverty bear to the whole number 
can not be determined from the data collected, but this fact empha- 
sizes the need of a more complete and detailed supervision of the 
child population of the country. Meanwhile there is evidence enough
-P-A-G-E-425
    
EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 413 
to support the opinion already expressed in legislative debates on the 
subject that a comprehensive system of relief must be maintained 
if the children of the poorest classes are to profit by the provision of 
free schools. The basis of such a system exists in the fund which 
every commune is required by law to maintain for the assistance of 
poor children; but the law is not everywhere regarded, many com- 
munes are unable to provide such a fund, and, in general, the system 
needs to be reorganized. 
SPECIAL COURTS FOR JUVENILE OFFENDERS. 
It is interesting to note in this connection the bill before the French 
Chamber of Deputies having for its purpose the reclamation of young 
offenders by the creation of special tribunals to deal with them, and 
by the substitution of liberty under surveillance, instead of imprison- 
ment, for minors convicted of misdemeanors. In the eighth cor- 
rectional tribunal of Paris it has been the practice for the last two 
years to take all the cases of young offenders on Mondays. Following 
this example, the bill referred to proposes a special court for juveniles 
in every arrondissement having at least 100,000 inhabitants in its 
chief city. The underlying principle of the measure is the postpone- 
ment of the actual punishment in order to provide an opportunity 
for reformation. The penal law recognizes 18 years as the age of 
majority, but this long minority divides naturally into two periods— 
the years below 13 and those above. Every offender under 13 will be 
regarded as irresponsible and, whenever it is possible, will be re- 
manded by the special court to the custody of his parents, and they 
will be obliged to support him. So long as the period of tutelage lasts 
the morals of the offender will be supervised either by some charit- 
able association or by some competent individual. Ultimately, if the 
youth conducts himself well, he may be released from all direct super- 
vision; but if he should continue on the downward path, the sentence 
which has been pronounced provisionally will become operative. 
Regret is expressed that it is not at present practicable to urge the 
appointment of special judges for the children’s courts, after the 
American plan. It is, however, provided that the judges assigned 
to these courts shall not be subject to the customary annual rotation. 
They will hold the same seats long enough to become specialists in the 
delicate matters assigned to them.* 
CRITICISMS OF THE OFFICIAL PROGRAMMES. 
The renewed solicitude with respect to the matter of school attend- 
ance has excited close scrutiny of the official course of instruction for 
primary schools. This is criticised as too ambitious and too bookish.   
* «For an interesting account of this measure, introduced into the Chamber of Deputies 
by M. Deschanel, see Les Tribunaux pour Enfants, by Louis Delzons, Revue des Deux 
Mondes, June 15, 1909, pp. 885-902.
-P-A-G-E-426
  414 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
It forces upon children information and ideas remote from their 
experience and stage of development, and results too often in absurd 
associations of facts, historic and scientific, such as are constantly 
occurring in the examinations. These confused notions indicate, not 
so much stupidity on the part of the pupils as radical mistakes in 
the methods and scope of the instructions Their correction would 
be found in the simplification of the programmes—in history, by the 
choice of the principal national events; in science, by the presentation 
of a few elementary notions related to matters of familiar observa- 
tion and easily illustrated in class. In the opinion of M. Steeg, oral 
instruction has been carried to excess. “It is necessary,” he says, 
“to restrain the passion for oral instruction, which forces the chil- 
dren to listen to so many vain words constantly forgotten and dis- 
torted and often not worth remembering.” He continues: 
The principal effort of primary instruction, after the exercises absolutely 
necessary to form the habit of observation and the use of language, should be 
to enable the pupils to read easily and intelligently. Is it not probable that 
the greater number of young people who, at 20 years of age, are unable to read 
would have retained the ability if they had read more often in school, instead 
of listening to lessons soon forgotten or struggling with difficult exercises in 
grammar and arithmetic? Is not reading the surest means of acquiring the 
indispensable elements of history, science, and grammar? * * * Because 
the book was formerly abused by making it a mere instrument of mechanical 
reading, it should not to-day be discarded as useless. 
Books speak a language more precise, reliable, profound, and more moving 
than that used by the majority of teachers. They contain the treasure of 
knowledge and experience acquired by the human race. It is not pretended 
that this intellectual and moral treasure can be imparted to every pupil, but it 
is possible to give everyone the key to it, to make it familiar to him, and to 
excite his interest in it. Then when he leaves school, although he may forget 
much that he has learned there, he will have a taste for study and will possess 
the essential means of learning. 
PROVISION FOR PROLONGING THE EDUCATION OF THE PEOPLE. 
Intimately connected with the subject of compulsory school attend- 
ance and the simplification of the elementary programme is that of 
provision for continuing the instruction of the young who have passed 
the compulsory school age. The neglect of the masses of adolescent 
youth is one of the chief evils with which the Republic has to con- 
tend. The majority of the children quit school at the very moment 
when they have most need of restraint and guidance, and when their 
minds could profit most by instruction and their characters by good 
counsel. The higher primary schools, intended for children 12 to 15 
years of age, offer the best means of continuing the formal instruc- 
tion of the people, but few children of the laboring classes enter 
these. In 1907 the total enrollment in public schools of this grade 
was 44,577, viz, 25,363 boys, 19,214 girls. A large proportion of these

pupils were preparing for admission to normal schools or for the 
lower grades of the postal, telegraph, tax office, and other branches 
of the civil service.

RELATION BETWEEN HIGHER PRIMARIES AND PRACTICAL SCHOOLS OF 
COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY. 
   
        
         
        
      
      
             
        
      The practical schools of commerce and industry, which have been 
differentiated from the higher primary schools, draw pupils from the 
same social class. These schools are increasing rapidly in number 
and in attendance; whereas in 1899 they enrolled only about 3,000 
pupils, in 1906 their enrollment was 9,767, of whom 7,745 were boys, 
while in 1907-8 the total number of schools reported was 60, with an 
enrollment of 26,920 pupils. 
This early division of schools on industrial lines is criticised in 
many quarters as tending to narrow the intellectual outlook of the 
youth of the laboring classes and to prevent the development of 
social sympathies and common aspirations. The schools of commerce 
and industry, it is declared, do not answer the same purpose as actual 
apprenticeship, and the decrease in the amount of time given to the 
usual branches of study results in a distinct loss in the intellectual 
alertness of the pupils. A member of the superior council of technical 
instruction says on this point— 
the pupils who have received methodical, scientific, rational, and progressive 
instruction, to whom has been given a fund of general knowledge, may not be 
lable to compete at once with specialized apprentices, but in compensation they 
are much better able to adapt themselves to the business as a whole. It can 
mot be denied that after 4 little practice on their part comparison is out of the 
iquestion; the unfortunate apprentice who has not received scientific training 
is completely eclipsed.

             416 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
The same authority adds: 
After thirteen years’ experience in technical education I have come to the 
conclusion that it is too feeble on the side of general education as compared with 
practical training. As industry develops it is more and more necessary that 
the brain of the workman should be more developed than his hands. * * * 
In the shop, the workman who stands in the first rank is the one whose 
knowledge is ever increasing. 
In view of these and similar statements by experts, M. Steeg 
expresses the opinion that one class of higher primary schools should 
be recognized, with varying adjustments of theoretic and manual or 
industrial training, to be determined in each case by local conditions. 
He says: 
It is a fact—and a fortunate one—that the great industries and vast com- 
mercial enterprises do not absorb all the resources and activities of our country. 
Hxcessive specialization is not necessary in the villages and towns where 
merchants, artisans, and even agriculturists themselves need versatility and 
general knowledge in order that they may be able to manage all the various 
details of their complex tasks. They are at once commercial factors, account- 
ants and manufacturers, workmen and directors. They constitute the wealth 
of our country and assure its rapid, pacific, and lawful evolution. The instruc- 
tion which is imparted in the higher primary schools corresponds exactly to 
the needs of this large and important part of the French population. 
Against the above opinion it is interesting to consider that ex- 
pressed in the report on the estimates for the ministry of commerce 
and industry, to which pertain the practical schools of commerce and . 
industry. The author of this report, M. Clémentel, says: 
Comparing the time tables and programmes of the practical schools with those 
of the industrial and commercial sections of the higher primary schools, it will 
be seen that great differences exist between the two classes of institutions. The 
conclusion seems inevitable that the practical schools equal the higher primary 
schools in respect to general education, and that they are very much superior 
to the latter in regard to technical instruction because they are better equipped 
and specially organized for this work. Under these conditions, it would seem 
that in this country, which owes its wealth in great part to its commerce and 
its industry, the practical schools ought to hold the chief place. Unfortunately 
there are only 60 of these schools with 11,506 pupils in 1907-8, while there 
are 221 higher primary schools with an enrollment of 26,920 pupils. 
          
                   
There is, however, according to M. Clémentel, good ground for 
believing that in a few years, if the Government is allowed the ap- 
propriation necessary, this technical education will have very great 
extension. In the past two years 6 schools have been created in as 
many cities, and 26 cities have recently entered into negotiations with 
the ministry of commerce and industry with a view to the establish- 
ment of schools of this character.’ : 
It is interesting to note in this connection that the practical 
schools of commerce and industry, referred to above, illustrate an

  EDUCATION IN FRANCE. ALT 
endeavor of the French Government to meet a demand somewhat 
similar to that which is just now exciting in our own country the 
widespread discussion of vocational education. The demand in 
France grew out of the unsatisfactory condition of French industry 
as revealed in the Paris Exhibition of 1878. Attention was called 
to signs of a decline in the technical qualities of workmanship there 
displayed, a decline that was attributed to the want of provision for 
the technical training of the great body of the workmen. The agita- 
tion of the subject went further than a consideration of manufactured 
articles and included the status of French commercial agents and 
,clerks as compared with those of other countries. The final outcome 
of the efforts thus excited was an endeavor on the part of the State 
to organize a system of primary technical instruction which, after 
many years of experiment in administration, has at last been placed 
under the sole charge of the ministry of commerce. The system of 
schools referred to includes, in addition to those just named, five state 
institutions of wider scope, the écoles nationales professionnelles.* 
The recent official programmes of secondary schools (lycées and 
colleges) duplicate to some extent those provided for the higher 
primaries. This duplication, and the rivalry of the higher primary 
and the practical schools, explain the growing demand for a reclassi- 
fication of public schools and colleges for both economic and educa- 
tional considerations. 
FUNDS FOR PROMOTING ATTENDANCE UPON HIGHER PRIMARY SCHOOLS. 
The importance of inducing young people of ability to continue 
their studies beyond the brief period of the elementary school has 
always been recognized by the Republic, and a system of public 
bourses (scholarship funds) is maintained for this purpose. 
In addition to the ordinary funds of this character, appropriations 
are made for a special class of bourses which enable the recipients 
to pursue their studies in a foreign country. Both pupils and teachers 
may be candidates for these special bourses, for which, in 1908, there 
were appropriated 54,000 francs ($10,800). The number of recipi- 
ents was 18, of whom 7 were professors in primary normal schools, 
and 11 were former pupils in higher primary schools. The bourses 
available in foreign countries are intended for persons who expect to 
teach the respective languages or to make use of them in business. 
The total appropriation by the Government in 1908 for the several 
classes of bourses pertaining to the department of primary instruc- 
tion was 750,000 francs ($150,000).

AGENCIES FOR THE CONTINUATION OF POPULAR EDUCATION. 
Reference has already been made to the bill at present before the 
legislature providing, among other matters, for the organization of 
the means of popular education auxiliary to the school. This work 
of continued education is carried on by various agencies in France, 
chiefly of private initiative, but fostered by public appropriations. 
The following details indicate the variety and extent of the efforts 
in this direction. 
In the year 1907-8 the courses of instruction for adults reached 
their highest number, 48,565 (30,271 for young men, 18,294 for 
young women). This is a gain of 317 over the previous year and as 
gain of 8,000 over the number reported in 1900. The number of 
persons enrolled in the classes was 533,676, of whom 404,419 attended 
regularly. 
Public lectures, given by university men who know how to present 
information in popular form, are constantly increasing in number. 
The lectures differ from the popular conferences in which the audi- 
tors participate in the discussion of the subjects presented. The 
latter, which reached a total of 82,481 in 1907-8, have the benefit of 
stereopticon views furnished by the Musée Pédagogique and by the 
Ligue Frangaise de l’Enseignement. 
The so-called popular universities (universités populaire), which 
are assemblies for the spread of political and social theories, are on 
the decline; only 49 meetings were reported for 1907-8. ‘ 
Under the head of social works are included the mutualités sco- 
laires, or school mutual-aid societies, which encourage thrift and the 
spirit of helpfulness among the young. These societies number 3,133, 
with 753,022 members. The contributions for the year reached 
4,000,000 francs ($800,000), of which about one-fourth was paid in 
by pupils who drew relief during days of illness. 
The school patronages, or associations formed in the interests of 
young people 13 to 20 years of age, numbered 2,129, of which 829 
were for girls and 1,300 for boys. 
The expenditure for these various activities, directed to the intel- 
Jectual and social development of youths and adults, is provided 
for by private donations, subscriptions, and fees, and by public ap- 
propriations, local and state. 
The amount realized in 1907-8 from private sources, including 
membership subscriptions in the societies engaged in the work and 
the fees paid by attendants, was 2,547,000 francs ($509,400). The 
public appropriations were as follows: By the municipalities, 1,631,- 
214 francs ($326,242); of this amount 341,209 francs ($68,241) 
came from Paris; by the departmental councils, 59,175 francs 
($11,835) ; by the State, 700,000 francs ($140,000). The total from
-P-A-G-E-431
    EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 419 
public sources was thus $546,318, or about $37,000 more than the 
amount from private sources. 
OPINIONS ELICITED BY AN EDUCATIONAL INQUIRY. 
In view of the deepening conviction that the school should be 
better adapted to the present conditions of society, the Manuel 
Général conducted an extended inquiry during the year for the 
purpose of securing nonprofessional opinions on the subject. Parents, 
directors of large industries, associations of workmen, all were asked 
to take part in this symposium. The following considerations are 
drawn from a summary of the replies by M. F. Buisson, with whom 
the inquiry originated. 
The opinion is very generally expressed by the correspondents 
that primary education should be more practical, more concrete, 
more living, that is, less bookish. To this end many advise that the 
course of instruction be varied, adapted in each case to local condi- 
tions or to the diverse vocations, agricultural, commercial, or manu- 
facturing, for which the pupils are destined. With this view M. 
Buisson himself agrees, provided that this new réle be reserved for 
the second stage of primary education, that is, for pupils 12 to 18 
years of age, and not attempted with those 7 to 11. 
The most important considerations brought out by the corre- 
spondence relate to the “to-morrow of the elementary school.” It 
is generally agreed that the obligatory school period should be pro- 
longed. It is significant that the representatives of the trade unions 
insist strongly upon this course. It is impossible, they say, to make 
a boy a good apprentice at 12 years of age; if this is attempted, he 
generally becomes merely a little servant to the employer. 
It is urged, also, that the time has come for the organization of “a 
second obligatory instruction, that of adolescence.” On this point 
there is striking unanimity in the replies. The interests of national 
industry demand, it is said, that technical training should not be re- 
served for a privileged few, but brought within the reach of the hun- 
dreds of thousands that make up the army of industry in France. 
“ What our neighbors to the east of us have accomplished by this 
course,” says M. Bisson, “ makes further demonstrations unnecessary.” 
Finally there is general agreement that the education of adolescents 
should not be imposed upon the teachers of the ordinary elementary 
schools. With full appreciation of the service that the teachers 
have already rendered in this respect, it is recognized that an organ- 
ized system of popular education, complementary to that of the 
school, would require a special corps of instructors, experts in the 
several industries toward which the training should be directed, and 
at the same time, competent and trained teachers.*

420 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
DEPARTMENT OF SECONDARY EDUCATION. 
Secondary education in France forms a distinct administrative 
department in the ministry of public instruction, comprising the 
state lyecées and communal colleges for boys and the institutions for 
girls, which latter have the same names, although differing entirely 
in their course of study. 
SECONDARY SCHOOLS FOR BOYS. 
The typical secondary schools are the lycées for boys, established 
by the State with the concurrence of the municipalities. Every effort 
is made by the Government to attract to these schools the most prom- 
ising youth of the nation, and to surround them with influences that 
shall insure their devotion to the Republic. The solicitude of the 
Government in this respect has been greatly increased by the prestige 
of the private secondary schools, which have long flourished under 
clerical direction, and which are still in vigorous activity under new 
conditions resulting from the repression of the teaching orders. 
The communal colleges follow nominally the same programmes as 
the lycées, but, as a rule, do not maintain the complete secondary 
course of study. Under recent regulations, the colleges are assuming 
more and more the character of local high schools similar to the 
higher primary schools. The lycées and colleges have, as a rule, both 
boarding and day pupils. The household régime of the lycées is 
strictly regulated by official orders; that of the colleges is either under 
municipal control or left to the principal as a private undertaking. 
In the latter case the college is subject to the evils attending poor, 
unendowed, boarding schools, aggravated by the presence of pro- 
fessors independent of and often at variance with the principal. 
There are indications that the local colleges and the higher primary 
schools may gradually be merged into one, save where there is demand 
for a regional boarding school, liberally supported and amply 
equipped for the full course of secondary education. 
STATISTICAL SUMMARY OF SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
In 1908 there were 111 lycées for boys and 229 communal col- 
leges, having a total registration of 96,289 students, as against 
96,462 in 1907. Table 5 shows the number of students in the lycées of 
the Paris Academy as compared with the number in the provincial 
academies. Table 6 presents the corresponding statistics for the 
communal colleges. Table 7 brings into comparative view the enroll- 
ment in the different classes of secondary establishments, public and 
private, for specified years,

INFERENCES FROM THE STATISTICS. 
The particulars concerning the student body brought out in the 
foregoing tables are followed with intense interest by the Govern- 
ment because of the rivalry of the private secondary schools. It 
appears that there was a decrease of 173 pupils in the total registra- 
tion in the public secondary schools in 1908 as compared with 1907. 
This loss was wholly in the colleges, the lycées having gained 215 
pupils. The detailed statistics bring out the fact that the number 
of boarders in the lycées decreased by 346 as compared with an 
increase of 561 day students. The colleges lost both boarders and 
day students, viz, 144 and 241, respectively. The opinion is expressed 
that the slight decline in the enrollment of the public secondary 
schools results from other causes than the superior attractions of the 
private schools. Among these causes are noted, in particular, the 
stationary or declining population, the steady increase in the number 
of pupils attending the higher primary schools, and the multiplica- 
tion of technical schools, which attract ever-increasing numbers 
from the middle classes. In view of these conditions, it appears that 
the term “secondary education” must be used to include varied types 
of schools. It has already been suggested in the Chamber of Depu- 
ties that in order to form a fair estimate of the extent of public sec- 
ondary education and of the appropriations required for its support, 
the statistics of the traditional secondary schools and those of the 
higher primary schools and the technical schools of secondary grade 
should be included in one category. 
CURRENT DISCUSSIONS. 
The current discussions of secondary education center in the 
reform programme authorized by official decree of July 20, 1901, 
which went into operation in 1902.. The decree modified both the 
internal regimen of the secondary schools (lycées) and their scheme 
of study. It is in the latter respect only that its results bear upon 
problems of universal interest. As in other European countries 
which follow the French classification, the term secondary education, 
in France, implies a complete course of general education, beginning 
at a very elementary stage and terminating with the bachelor’s 
degree. After this, there remain for the student only the specialized 
courses of the university or the great technical schools, all of which 
are distinctively professional. The French scheme of secondary 
study covers, therefore, the work of the American high school with 
about two years of the course of our leading colleges. 
THE PROGRAMME oF 1902. 
Following a preparatory course of two years (intended for pupils 
7 to 8 years of age), the lycée course proper is divided into two 
 
-P-A-G-E-435
  EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 423 
cycles: The lower cycle covers four years and comprises a classical 
course and a nonclassical course; the upper cycle comprises three 
years. The programme for two of the three years is arranged in 
four parallel courses, as follows: (A) Classical course; (B) Latin 
and modern languages; (C) Latin and sciences; (D) sciences and 
modern languages. Following these two years is the class of phil- 
osophy and mathematics, each side comprising a classical and a non- 
classical section. The bachelor’s diploma is awarded to students who 
complete either one of the full secondary courses of instruction and 
pass the degree examination.* 
OPINIONS OF PROFESSORS AS TO THE RELATIVE VALUE OF THE SEVERAL COURSES OF 
STUDY. 
The new programme has been in operation seven years, or the full 
period of the lycée course; hence, a considerable body of students 
have pursued their studies under its requirements. The current 
criticisms of the system have, therefore, a basis in experience.. They 
reflect, moveover, conclusions reached from entirely different stand- 
points. Professors wedded to the old system of a single course with 
limited electives are found in agreement with young professors who 
at first welcomed the radical change. Parents are dissatisfied, the 
press has been full of the subject, and special meetings have been 
called under distinguished auspices, to discuss the apparent decline 
in scholastic standards and attainments. An examination into the 
actual working of the programmes was undertaken in 1907 by the 
Société pour l’Etude des Questions d’Enseignement Secondaire. Cir- 
cular letters were addressed to leading professors of secondary edu- 
cation presenting specific questions under two main considerations, 
namely, that of the present state of literary studies in secondary 
education, and that of the general state of studies in the classes of 
letters, as indicated by the attainments of the students in the lan- 
guages studied, by their general development, and by their power 
of attention and of concentrated effort. 
The correspondents, by a large majority, give preeminence to 
classical studies as the instruments of mental discipline and culture; 
at the same time, there is an evident preference for the combination 
of Latin and sciences over Latin and the living languages. 
As regards the entire scheme of study with its parallel courses 
and divergent aims, the opinions brought out by the inquiry are 
summed up in a few words: Overcrowded programmes, varied and 
often contradictory purposes, and precocious specialization. This 
view of the situation is emphasized by citations from individual 
professors.   
«For the full programmes of 1902, see Reports of the Commissioner of Education: 1902, 
Vol. I, pp. 687-693 ; 1907, Vol. I, pp. 149-150.
-P-A-G-E-436
    
424 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
One professor observes: 
It seems that secondary education would be in danger of becoming inferior 
to that given in the higher primary schools, unless it rests upon a solid basis 
of the study of Latin and Greek continued from the lower class, sixiéme, by 
means of the principal works (grammatical and literary)’ which make up a 
course of literary studies. 
Another writes: 
The classical studies have been declining for some time. To-day the word 
which designates them is merely a euphuism, a sad irony. Few pupils in 
Latin master the elements of the grammar, the greater part translate poorly, 
the compositions are often. a mere tissue of platitudes.¢ 
The highest class of the lycée, i. e., philosophy and mathematics, 
was not particularly affected by the programme of 1902, and con- 
sequently the opinions of the professors of this class, on the questions 
submitted, are formed entirely from their observation of the students 
who come up from the different lower sections. 
The professors of philosophy who replied to the circular inquiry 
complained of the lack of maturity, of judgment, and of reasoning 
power, and even of the orthography of the students who come to” 
them. For the part of the course which is common to the classes 
of mathematics and philosophy, and particularly for the study of 
scientific methods, it is declared that the students who have fol- 
lowed the classical sections seem to be entirely wanting in com- 
prehension of scientific principles. In this respect they are inferior 
to the students from the scientific section. This is attributed to the 
practical elimination of the sciences from the classical sections. 
One professor observes: 
I would not say that it is desirable to increase the time given to science in 
those sections, but it is very important that the course should be so organized 
that the students may comprehend what science is, what the scientific spirit is, 
and what are the methods of thought required by scientific research. The little 
that they now acquire in these respects comes chiefly from the instruction in 
history; it would seem that the professors of science in the classes of letters 
might form a conception of their subject at once more philosophic and more 
truly educative. 
This opinion illustrates the great change that has taken place in the 
conception of philosophy itself. Formerly the class of rhetoric was 
regarded as the best preparation for this study; to-day it requires 
that habit of mind which is promoted by the sciences, especially 
the sciences that lend themselves to mathematical expression. This 
idea is brought out by several professors who agree that the time 
seems to have come “when philosophy should no longer be con- 
sidered as a continuation of the class of rhetoric.”

  EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 425 
CONFERENCE ON THE STATE OF LITERARY STUDIES. 
On account of the widespread conviction that literary culture and 
ideals are declining under the new system, a conference was called 
at the Musée Pédagogique by M. Liard, vice-rector of the Paris 
Academy,* to consider “the crisis in the methods of instruction in 
the French language.” The conference, which convened in January 
of the present year, was opened by Professor Lanson, of the Paris 
Faculty of Letters, with an analysis of the conditions that have 
brought on the crisis. Professor Lanson dwelt upon the decline in 
the attainments of the students as shown by the results of the 
university examinations, and upon the evidences of a general lower- 
ing in the standards of the language as indicated by the small pro- 
portion of classic dramas brought out in the Paris theaters, and by 
the style of current literature. 
There are causes for this decline quite apart from the curriculum 
and methods of the schools. Among these Professor Lanson men- 
tioned in particular the increasing number of reviews and journals, 
which tend to destroy the taste for serious reading, and the enormous 
interest in scientific and economic questions. This interest has altered 
the home atmosphere around the pupils, so that they no longer bring 
to their studies the old literary prepossessions. An additional cause 
of change in the student body is due to the fact that many families 
which formerly patronized the public secondary schools are sending 
their boys to private schools, and the places thus vacated are filled 
with pupils from an humbler class. Despite the originality, vigor, 
and mental keenness displayed by many of the latter, a large propor- 
tion of them are in the primary stage of development. 
To these causes, all of which have their influence upon formal in- 
struction in language and literature, are added the increased diffi- 
culty of treating the subject on account of the great range of lit- 
erature with which the students are expected to become familiar and 
the changed direction of the study. With reference to the last con- 
sideration, Professor Lanson says, substantially : 
Formerly the entire literary instruction was directed to general culture, 
designed to awaken the interest of pupils in varied matters, many of them not 
exclusively literary, as ethics, history, philosophy, art. For the last thirty years, 
under a pressure which the professors have not been able to resist, the instruc- 
tion in French has become more and more a specialty, essentially a critical and 
historical study. The forms of literary works, their esthetic character, the 
doctrines of literary schools are studied. * * * With this critical and 
historical study of literature, the instruction preserves also a psychologic 
  
«The Academy of Paris, the largest division of the French system of public instruction, 
includes the University of Paris, the special schools of university rank, lycées and colleges, 
and primary schools. The nominal rector is the minister of public instruction ; the virtual 
chief of this academic district is the vice-rector.

character. And as the psychologic study of great works has been carried to 
an extreme, the professor who wishes to put his personal mark upon his in- 
struction is led into an excess of subtle analyses out of all proportion to the 
culture and mental maturity of his pupils. Thus, while the students of Latin 
and Greek find themselves still upon solid ground, since the interpretation of 
classic texts gives them material to seize and work upon, in respect to French 
they have the feeling that it is the region of the vague, the field for the exer- 
cise of the brilliant fantasy of the professor. 
In view of the conditions set forth, Professor Lanson expresses the 
opinion that one of two courses is inevitable. Hither (1) the higher 
culture must be reserved for an élite class, to be selected by rigorous 
tests, upon merit alone, and the greater part of the secondary schools 
be transformed into higher primary schools adapted to those of 
inferior ability, or (2) the standard of secondary education must be 
lowered.* 
In succeeding sessions of the conference the methods applied to dif- 
ferent divisions of the literary programme were discussed by pro- 
fessors representing each. Particular interest attaches to the matter 
of composition, which has always been an important exercise in the 
lycées. According to Professor Rudler of the Lycée Charlemagne, 
Paris, the loss of definite methods and aims upon which Professor 
Lanson dwelt has had a very decided effect upon the teaching of 
composition. These qualities were promoted by the annual competi- 
tions formerly held in Paris, in which the ablest students from all the 
lycées participated. Uniform requirements in well-known forms 
of composition—the letter and the essay—controlled the prepara- 
tions. The subjects assigned were drawn from morals, history, poli- 
tics, and literature, the latter particularly after 1867. Since this 
exercise was discontinued, there has been no common plan of instruc- 
tion. The change in this respect is regretted by some professors, ap- 
proved by others. 
“This formal discipline,” “the type of education by general ideas 
and analogies,” as it is called by Professor Rudler, was the only one 
possible before scientific studies and methods developed; “they rep- 
resent,” he says, “in the history of education what Cousinianism 
represents in that of philosophy.” But a new type is now necessary, 
corresponding to that study of reality which the age demands. 
“ Education,” he adds, “can not refuse to follow this movement.” 
Professor Rudler’s suggestions, as to the changes in the composition 
exercises that this necessity occasions, reduce to the choice of different 
subjects, greater precision in the use of words as befits the presenta- 
tion of ascertained facts and the record of observations, and greater 
freedom in the general plan of the composition.

In the discussion which closed the conference, the majority of the 
professors present agreed that the falling off in the literary attain- 
ments of the students had been exaggerated. It was also suggested 
that the changes in the composition exercises, advised by Professor 
Rudler, are gradually taking place without the intervention of official 
orders. 
OFFICIAL INSTRUCTIONS. 
As a result of the conference, special instructions ‘pertaining to the 
subject were issued in February of the present year to the academic 
rectors. In the circular letter accompanying the instructions, the 
minister of public instruction recalled that at the beginning of 1908 
the general inspectors were charged to devote chief attention to the 
matter of instruction in the French language and literature. The 
new instructions, drawn up in accordance with the advice of the in- 
spectors and that of representative professors, are intended to promote 
conferences on the part of the professors of the French language and 
literature, and to bring about closer relations between them and the 
examining boards in order that the baccalaureate examination, which 
is the goal of secondary education, may be kept in accord with the 
scheme and general purpose of the literary course prescribed by the 
programmes of 1902. Similar directions, it is said, with reference to 
the scientific course, have already produced excellent results. 
THE NEW SYSTEM OF ART INSTRUCTION. 
In the scheme of liberal education as maintained in France, art 
enters as an integral factor. Great significance attaches, therefore, to 
the arrété of January 6, 1909, which provides for a change in the 
system of art instruction in the lycées and colleges, the same to go into 
effect in October next. The change is complete in both principle and 
practice. Disregarding the traditional questions of the essence of 
things and a preconceived logical ideal, the fundamental considera- 
tion in the new system is that of the pupil’s own interest. Pencil 
and paper are put into his hands in order that he may reproduce 
whatever attracts and pleases him. In other words, the basis of the 
system is psychological. The instruction consists in showing the 
pupil the faults in his representation, and thus leading him to the 
habit of exact observation, to the perception of proportions and the 
estimate of distances, and to the gradual mastery of the technic of 
art. The purpose kept in view is the development of the individual, 
not the formation of artists.

  428 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
The change from the geometric system of drawing, formulated by 
the sculptor Guillaume, and officially adopted for the lycées and col- 
leges in 1880, to a system in which natural forms and color harmonies 
furnish the models, is the outcome of long-continued efforts on the 
part of artists and professors of art. In 1897 an association of Paris 
teachers of drawing was formed to advocate reform in this branch, 
and a magazine, the Moniteur du Dessin, was founded as the organ of 
this body. The movement received fresh impulses from the Inter- 
national Congress on Art Instruction held in Berne in 1904, and the 
succeeding congress held in London in the summer of 1908. 
In accordance with the urgent representations of the professors of 
drawing, the minister of public instruction appointed a commission 
of experts in 1908 to investigate the subject ; the new scheme embodies 
their recommendations. 
In principle, in the sequence of subjects, in the methods and mate- 
rial indicated, the new course of art instruction in France is in 
striking agreement with that followed in the leading cities of this 
country and with that adopted a few years ago for the schools of 
Prussia. The only serious criticism that the scheme has encountered 
is that of Professor Quénioux, who, although himself an ardent advo- 
cate of the principle of the reform, objects to the detailed programme 
on the ground that it makes its appeal, in the earliest stages, to mental 
curiosity and the spirit of observation; whereas, in his opinion, the 
imagination of the child should be chiefly exercised up to the age of 
. 13 years. In this respect the new system seems to violate sound 
psychological principles. The fear is also expressed that the change 
is too extreme, and that a gradual transition from the old to the new 
would, in the end, prove more satisfactory. The very completeness 
of the change marks it, however, as a departure from the usual ad- 
ministrative course. 
PUBLIC SECONDARY SCHOOLS FOR GIRLS. 
‘The establishment and progress of public secondary schools (lycées 
and communal colleges) for girls are among the most important 
achievements of the Republic. The law of December 21, 1880, au- 
thorizing this provision encountered intense opposition, as was inev- 
itable, since it violated customs and social prejudices of long stand- 
ing. At the same time, the provision met a demand that had already 
secured the recognition of many of the leading men of the nation. 
Among these were M. Duruy, minister of public instruction from 
1863 to 1869, and M. Gréard, the eminent director of the Academy of 
Paris, which position he held from 1879 to 1904.
-P-A-G-E-441
EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 429 
By an official order of 1867, Minister Duruy had authorized courses 
of secondary instruction for girls to be given by university professors 
in accordance with prescribed regulations. At Paris and at several 
provincial cities, this order had been carried into effect, and appro- 
priations had been made for the maintenance of the work from mu- 
nicipal and government funds. In 1880 the amount of the govern- 
ment appropriation for this service was 100,000 francs ($20,000), 
and in 1881, under the impulse of the Camille Sée law, 300,000 francs 
($60,000). This provisional measure had much to do with overcom- 
ing unreasonable prejudices respecting the attendance of girls upon 
public institutions, but it was a very inadequate expression of the 
purposes even of its originator, who was an earnest advocate of a 
complete, well-organized, and uniform system of education for girls 
as an essential part of a general system of public education. 
The new institutions were established by the joint action of the 
State, the departments, and the communes, or municipalities, in 
which they should be located. Provision was made for both day and 
boarding pupils, and as a means of encouraging patronage it was 
expressly provided in the law that the State and the local authori- 
ties should found scholarships for the benefit of boarders and partial 
boarders. The original professors of this new class of secondary 
schools were all university graduates, and in 1881 a special normal 
school was established at Sévres to qualify women for service in the 
new institutions. In order to prepare students of the lycées for ad- 
mission to the same, a sixth year was added, in a few lycées, to the 
regular course of five years. 
PROGRESS. 
The passage of the law of 1880 was followed immediately by the 
organization of a lycée for girls at Montpellier and of a local college 
at Auxerre. In 1886 the number of lycées reported was 14, with 
2,243 students, and the number of local colleges 17, with 2,734 stu- 
dents, or a total enrollment of 4,977. In 1896 the enrollment in 
lycées for girls was 7,563, and in colleges 3,082, or a total enrollment 
of 10,645. This was an increase of nearly 114 per cent in ten years. 
The decade 1896 to 1906 showed still greater increase, the enrollment 
in lycées reaching 15,967 at the latter date, and in colleges 9,739, or 
a total of 25,706, an increase of 140 per cent in ten years. The latest 
official statistics pertaining to these institutions bear date. November 
5, 1908, at which time the enrollment in the 47 lycées for girls was 
17,352, and in the 61 colleges (including 2 in Algiers) 10,624, a total 
of 27,976 students.

GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS. 
In 1908 the government appropriation for this service, including 
the appropriation for the normal school at Sévres, amounted to 
8,214,075 francs, in round numbers $640,000. 
TUITION FEES AND SCHOLARSHIP FUNDS. 
The tuition fees, which are turned into the public treasury, vary 
in the different classes of the schools and in the different localities. 
The maximum annual fee in the lycées is 250 francs ($50) ; in the 
colleges the maximum is 150 francs ($30). The living expenses 
depend upon location. According to recent statistics the maximum 
cost of living and tuition in lycées outside of Paris is 900 francs 
($180), which is reported for a lycée at Lille; at Versailles the cost 
is 825 francs ($165). At Roanne it falls to 575 francs ($115). By 
aid of the public scholarship funds provided for by the law of 1880, 
the advantages offered by these secondary schools are extended to girls 
of marked ability who could not otherwise meet the expenses. The 
scholarships are provisional or definite, and cover the expense for 
tuition and board or for board only. The number awarded in 
1906-7 was 1,158. 
RELATION OF THE SCHOOLS TO THE HIGHER EDUCATION OF WOMEN. 
With respect to this very important division of the educational 
work created and sustained by the present Republic, the question 
naturally arises what relation it bears, if any, to the movement for 
the higher education of women, considering the expression in its 
broadest sense. This question is answered, in part, by the course of 
study, the scope of which may be inferred from the following time- 
table at present in force for the upper section:

   On the literary side the study of native literature and of the 
literature of England and Germany is particularly emphasized. 
The instruction is given by university professors, and is informing 
and cultivating. The students acquire also excellent command of 
the foreign languages for both speaking and writing. 
The subjects of the course of study that more particularly illustrate 
its adaptation to the duties and responsibilities of women are as fol- 
lows: Notions of common law, hygiene, and ethics (la morale). The 
course in common law includes: The relations of a minor to her 
father; the legal status of a married woman; the control of property; 
the laws governing inheritance, wills, and bequests; the nature of 
contracts; banking forms and processes; judicial procedures, and the 
main features of state and local administration. The course in 
hygiene includes such practical matters as the care of infants, the 
care of the aged, the means of guarding against infection, and the 
special study of tuberculosis.

432 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
It was intended by the author of the law of 1880, and his associates 
in the effort, that the education thus provided should be equivalent 
to, though not identical with, that offered in the secondary schools 
for boys. The development of mind and the formation of character 
were its aims; preparation for subsequent professional training was 
not regarded at all, excepting in the optional sixth year, already re- 
ferred to. But new demands have been raised by the increase in the 
number of young women who intend to enter the university facul- 
ties and who, under present conditions, are obliged to prepare for 
the baccalaureate, or admission examination, by private tuition. As 
a means of correcting this discrimination against those least able to 
protect their own interests, it has been determined to open in a few 
lycées for girls a special course assimilated to that of the lycées for 
boys, and, like the latter, preparing for the bachelor’s diploma. 
This special course would include Latin as an obligatory study. 
The first part of the baccalaureate examination would be passed at 
the end of the fifth year and the second part at the close of the extra 
sixth year. This provisional experiment is similar in purpose to 
the recent regulation reorganizing the secondary schools for girls in 
Prussia. Both measures are of special interest, not only as illustrat- 
ing social movements of deep import, but for their bearing upon the 
tendency in certain centers of our own country to introduce distinc- 
tions between the education of young men and young women where 
none now exist. 
DEPARTMENT OF HIGHER EDUCATION. 
To the department of higher education, ministry of public instrue- 
tion, belong the state universities and special schools, and the scien- 
tific bureaus of the Government. For the current expenses of this 
department, exclusive of administration, the Government appro- 
priated in 1908 the sum of 21,584,576 francs, equivalent to $4,316,915. 
Of this amount 16,941,246 francs ($3,388,249) went to the state uni- 
versities and special schools. The Government receives from the uni- 
versities the receipts from examination and diploma fees, which 
amounted in 1907 to 5,164,775 francs ($1,032,955). The remaining 
expenditure for these institutions was borne by municipal appropria- 
tions, bequests, income from invested funds, and students’ fees. Re- 
cent estimates show that the Government still bears the larger part 
of the university expenses. 
THE STATE UNIVERSITIES. 
From Table 9 it will be seen that the University of Paris registered 
in 1908 only 40 per cent of the total number of students; in 1888 its 
registration was greater than that of the combined provincial univer- 
sities. Two-fifths of the university students were enrolled in the
-P-A-G-E-445
  EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 433 
faculties of law (Table 10). The total number of students in Janu- 
ary, 1909, i. e., 41,897, included 4,732 foreigners. The women students 
numbered 3,609, of whom 1,643 were foreigners. 
The right to confer degrees is reserved exclusively to the state 
faculties by law of March 18, 1880. In addition to the state degrees 
of bachelor, licentiate, and doctor, a university doctorate has been 
created which attests the completion of specified studies, but does not 
admit the recipient to professional careers.

SPECIAL SCHOOLS OF UNIVERSITY RANK. 
The following special schools of university rank are under the 
minister of public instruction: Collége de France (appropriation,

School of Archives (Ecole Nationale des Chartes) (appropriation, 
$14,800) ; School of Oriental Languages (appropriation, $33,060) ; 
French School of Archeology at Rome (appropriation, $14,500) ; 
French School at Athens (appropriation, $23,540) ; Ecole Nationale 
des Beaux-Arts (appropriation, $84,052). 
The Superior Normal School, which has been consolidated with the 
University of Paris, received a separate appropriation in 1908, 
amounting to $139,528. 
The combined subventions to the independent college of social 
sciences and the closely related school of high social studies (Kcole 
Libre des Hautes Etudes Sociales) amounted in 1907 to $2,400. 
PRIVATE FACULTIES. 
Besides the state universities there are independent university fac- 
ulties under clerical auspices at Paris, Angers, Lille, Lyon, Marseille, 
and Toulouse. 
SCIENTIFIC ESTABLISHMENTS. 
The Musée Pédagogique, which since its organization in 1904 has 
become a unifying and inspiring center for the entire system of pub- 
lic instruction, has recently extended its equipment by the establish- 
ment of a laboratory of school hygiene. The Musée has charge of the 
system of international interchange of students carried on by agree- 
ment between the French Government and the Governments of Prus- 
sia, Saxony, Austria, England, and Scotland. During the year 1908 
the number of French students placed in English and German schools 
was 84, and the number of foreign students placed in French schools 
217. The appropriation for the various services carried on by the 
Musée amounted to 52,250 francs ($10,590). 
The appropriation for the Institut National de France, which is 
under the general direction of the minstry of public instruction, 
was 688,400 francs ($137,680). 
The technical schools, which complete the educational resources 
for which Paris is justly renowned, include the following, pertaining 
to the ministry of commerce and industry: 
The Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers, with 22 courses on 
the applied sciences and social economy, conducted by professors of 
, high distinction. For the accommodation of its clientéle the instruc- 
tion, imparted chiefly by lectures, is given from 8 to 10.30 in the 
evening. The institution receives an annual appropriation, which 
amounted in 1905 to 1,368,963 francs ($273,792). The Ecole Cen- 
trale des Arts et Manufactures, having a three-year course and ad-

mitting 250 students annually on the results of a rigid competitive 
examination. The state appropriation for this school in 1906 
amounted to 731,308 francs ($146,261). The Ecole des Hautes Etudes 
Commerciales, in which scholarship funds are maintained both by the 
State and the city. 
The Institut National Agronomique, the Ecole Polytechnique, the 
Ecole Supérieure de Guerre, etc., are under the charge of other minis- 
tries, according to their professional relations to the government 
service. 
CURRENT MOVEMENTS PERTAINING TO THE STATE UNIVERSITIES. 
The following survey of the status and current movements in the 
French universities is abridged from the report of M. Steeg, ac- 
companying the financial estimates for 1909 submitted to the Cham- 
ber of Deputies. 
THE UNIVERSITY OF PARIS AND THE PROVINCIAL UNIVERSITIES. 
The plan followed by the eminent men who have taken leading 
parts in reviving superior education in the last thirty years might 
be divided into two parts: First, to develop the University of Paris 
and render it one of the most prosperous in the world; and second, 
to arouse the provincial authorities, 
The University of Paris—The first part of the programme seems 
likely to be speedily realized. The University of Paris is richly 
endowed; it receives from the State nearly 4,000,000 francs 
($800,000) for its personnel and nearly 650,000 frances ($130,000) 
for its equipment, while its income from other sources exceeds 
2,000,000 francs ($400,000). It has, therefore, nearly 7,000,000 
francs ($1,400,000) a year at its disposal (which is 2,000,000 francs 
($400,000) more than the income of the University of Berlin). Its 
library consists of about 580,000 volumes. 
In addition to the works published by its members, 951 theses for 
the various doctors’ degrees were published under its auspices in 
1905-6 (300 in law, 500 in medicine, 30 in science, 30 in letters, 
11 for the diploma of superior studies in the faculty of sciences, 
and 80 for the corresponding degree in letters). The scientific out- 
‘put is therefore considerable; for the particulars referred to presup- 
pose actual scientific research. There were 16,935 students attend- 
ing the university in January, 1908, so that from this point of 
view the University of Paris is beyond question the first in the world, 
its attendance exceeding that of the next largest, Berlin (in 1906, 
14,008), by nearly three thousand.

tion publique et des beaux-arts, 17° section, instruction publique, par M. Steeg, député.
-P-A-G-E-448
  436 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
The provincial wniversities—These universities share, in a lesser 
degree, the development noted in the case of the University of Paris. 
Thus, they were attended by 18,063 students in January, 1908; their 
income proper amounted to 2,500,000 francs ($500,000), besides 
2,300,000 francs ($460,000) from loans and other transactions (in 
1907). During the scholastic year 1906-7, 250 degrees were granted 
in the doctorate of laws, 450 in medicine, with 20 diplomas in the 
faculty of sciences for higher research, and 80 in letters. The pro- 
fessors of these universities publish annually more than 100 volumes 
and 500 memoirs of important articles, besides thousands of notes 
upon judicial matters, scientific observations, bibliographies, etc. 
There is no doubt that great progress has been made by them in 
intellectual matters in recent years, as is shown, for example, by com- 
paring the space which French science occupies in German bibliog- 
raphies of 1908 with that given it fifteen years ago. To this scien- 
tific output the provincial universities have contributed their part. 
Nevertheless, these universities need new conveniences, new buildings, 
increased library facilities, and funds for books and periodicals. A 
comparison between the amounts appropriated for libraries at the 
French and German universities, and between the numbers of works 
in their respective libraries, shows the superiority of Germany in 
both respects. The University of Paris, with its 580,000 volumes 
and some 45,000 frances ($9,000) appropriation, exceeds the library 
of any one of the German universities, except Berlin, in the number 
of books. The libraries of the 14 provincial French universities, 
however, are much smaller than those of the German universities. 
It is complained that certain advantages are offered by the Uni- 
versity of Paris which tend to draw students away from the provin- 
cial universities; these are in particular certain scholarships and 
privileges in attending the école normale, which exempt from a por- 
tion of the military service, besides reducing expenses. It is pro- 
posed, by way of offsetting these attractions, to increase the number 
of scholarships in the provincial universities. 
Distinctions between wniversities—There are marked differences 
among the 14 provincial universities themselves in respect to wealth, 
attendance, and number of faculties, and, in general, there is a dis- 
tinction between such as are recognized as possessing a pronounced 
scholastic vitality and those which are inclined to be stationary. At 
some of the smaller institutions the professors acknowledge their ina- 
bility to give their students the preparation required by recent re- 
forms for licenses in philosophy or history. They are unable to 
offer either the number of lectures or the variety of instruction de- 
manded. This condition might be remedied by a readjustment of 
the faculties and by a redistribution of the subvention granted by 
the state to the individual universities. Thus the principal business 
 
-P-A-G-E-449
EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 437 
of the faculties of letters, history, and philosophy is to prepare 
teachers. They are virtually normal schools, and it is unnecessary 
that there should be 15 normal schools in France. Physicians, on the 
other hand, are more numerous than teachers, and yet the right to 
practice medicine is granted by only 7 faculties, while 15 grant the 
license to teach. This could be remedied by reserving this license 
for the more important faculties of letters and sciences, while the 
others should retain their scientific mission with equipments and 
become normal schools for the service of higher primary instruction. 
The universities, deprived of the power to grant licenses to teach in 
lycées and colleges, would be abandoned by a part of their students, 
who would repair to the larger institutions. These would take the 
name of universities of full exercise. It has further been suggested 
to specialize the universities so that one should be a center of history, 
another of chemistry, etc. Students devoted to special subjects would 
then repair to the proper university, and their libraries would be- 
come less encyclopedic and more special. But this tendency is apt to 
run into excess, and its advocates are prone to forget that when a 
university becomes specialized it ceases to be a university. 
Means of stimulating the scientific activity of the universities — 
The effectiveness of courses of instruction may be increased by con- 
currence among professors of the different faculties of the same uni- 
versity. For example, at Montpellier professors from the faculties 
of medicine, law, and sciences have given most interesting lectures 
to students in the faculty of philosophy upon the physiology of the 
brain, mental alienation, the logic of scientific methods, and the 
influence of logic upon the development of law. Conversely, a pro- 
fessor of philosophy has given a course in psychology at the clinic 
of mental maladies. At Bordeaux professors from the faculties of 
science have lectured upon the infinitesimal calculus to students of 
the philosophical faculty in their study of Leibnitz, and other in- 
stances are cited, as where masters of medicine have instructed future 
teachers of letters or sciences in the rules of school hygiene and men- 
tal hygiene. In this way the relations among the professors of dif- 
ferent faculties will be increased, and they will become cons¢ious 
of a collective life and be interested in it. This interest will be 
augmented by allowing the professors greater liberty in discussing 
university affairs and suggesting changes. The programme of the 
examination of the “agrégation des lycées,” elaborated by the min- 
istry, is uniform for the whole country, and imposes a kind of uni- 
formity of instruction upon university professors which tends to 
reduce them, as it were, to servitude to the programme. Individual- 
ity in instruction, in choice of text-books, etc., and the autonomy of 
the professor are destroyed by this tyranny of the programme, which 
consequently should be suppressed. :

UNIVERSITIES IN THEIR GEOGRAPHICAL RELATIONS. 
It has been charged that the universities are so absorbed in pure 
science and abstract learning that they take little interest in the 
material wants of the regions in which they are situated, and even if 
they do interest their city or department in their work they hardly 
ever arouse the interest of their province. Thus, there are municipal 
or departmental universities like the University of Rennes or of the 
mouths of the Rhone, but not a university of Brittany or Provence. 
This charge, however, is exaggerated, for the universities, far from 
being detached from the needs of their respective regions, do really 
take an important part in their material existence. In the pro- 
vincial faculties of science there are laboratories adapted to the agri- 
cultural or industrial or commercial needs of those parts of the 
country where the universities are situated; e. g., there is a school of 
watchmaking at Besangon, an electro-technical institute at Nancy 
and Grenoble, a brewing school at Nancy, an cenological school at 
Bordeaux, etc. These various laboratories are patronized by the 
inhabitants of the respective provinces, who apply to them for anal- 
yses and scientific examinations. The law faculties also give prac- 
tical courses, which are conducted by magistrates, lawyers, and min- 
isterial officers of the vicinity conjointly with the university pro- 
fessors to provide instruction in the management of business affairs. 
Finally, the faculties of letters tend more and more to become normal 
schools, since they have added pedagogics to their courses, and they 
are attended by large numbers of prospective teachers. Two of these 
faculties have contributed to the formation of infantry officers by 
supplying lecturers to military schools in their neighborhood. This 
practical direction of university instruction has given rise to the 
saying that superior instruction now has a threefold function, namely, 
to create, to impart, and to apply knowledge. On the other hand, 
the interest manifested by universities in the practical affairs of their 
provinces is reciprocated by the latter, as at Caen, where it is not 
merely the department of the Calvados, but the whole lower Seine 
region, which maintains the body of students; and at Besangon sub- 
ventions are granted the university not only by the city or the depart- 
ments of Doubs, but by the whole of the region of the Haute-Sadéne, 
and soon. Private individuals of wealth are now, especially in indus- 
trial districts, seconding the public bodies by giving funds to the 
universities for special purposes, such as laboratories. Suggestions 
are made to increase the influence of the universities by admitting to 
the university council (which is composed exclusively of professors) 
representatives of the societies or other bodies which grant subsidies 
to the universities, on certain specified occasions, and allowing them 
a voice in the discussions. The local interest in the institutions 
 
-P-A-G-E-451
  EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 439 
would thus be increased effectively. And, in addition to this measure, 
it is further suggested that the professors should publish a journal 
or bulletin containing a brief account of their work and publications. 
This might contain matter of special interest to the region or district, 
such as historical notes on the province and on its literature, its agri- 
culture, chemistry, etc. In this way the general public interest in 
their university life would be awakened all through the provinces. 
FOREIGN ACTIVITY OF FRENCH UNIVERSITIES. 
An Italian-French institute was created at Florence by the Uni- 
versity of Grenoble, which has become a center of Italian studies. 
Students from Grenoble make a prolonged sojourn in Italy, where, 
while continuing their own studies, they may be of service to the 
young Italians who wish to study the French language and literature. 
The Universities of Bordeaux and Toulouse have directed their efforts 
toward Spain. Prof. Pierre Paris, of the faculty of letters of 
the University of Bordeaux, has made several archeological trips in 
Spain since 1896. In 1897 a society of correspondence was estab- 
lished for the purpose of carrying on Spanish research. In 1898 a 
bulletin was published and a mission organized by the university to 
improve relations with the Spanish universities, which met with a 
cordial reception at Madrid, Salamanca, and Valladolid, and there 
is now to be an interchange of professors between the Spanish uni- 
versities and the universities of Bordeaux and Toulouse. For its 
part, the University of Toulouse is organizing a union of French 
students in Spain. Special courses will be provided for such stu- 
dents in Madrid and Burgos by Spanish professors, to whom the 
University of Toulouse has applied for that purpose. 
RECENT MEASURES PERTAINING TO THE MEDICAL FACULTIES. 
The unsatisfactory condition of medical instruction in France, in 
particular the absence of provision for training specialists and of 
adequate laboratory facilities, have long been subjects of complaint 
and criticism by professors and physicians. The urgent demand for 
reform in these respects led to the appointment in 1907 of a govern- 
ment commission to investigate the conditions and advise measures 
for correcting the evils complained of. Preliminary to the full re- 
port of the commission, the report of a subcommission charged to 
study in detail the various propositions submitted for consideration 
and to suggest measures of reform was presented. This report dealt 
with the general education of medical students as a basis of their pro- 
fessional training and with the improvement of the conditions and 
courses of medical instruction.
-P-A-G-E-452
  440 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
Under the first consideration, the report émphasizes the need on 
the part of intending medical students of more thorough training in 
literary and philosophical studies. These, it declares, “are the most 
efficacious instruments of intellectual and moral discipline, imparting 
the habit of independent and exact reflection, maintaining the dis- 
interested pursuit of the things of the mind, opposing idealism to 
the utilitarian current of the time, and furnishing the individual for 
all time with general ideas.” The arrangement of the secondary 
programmes of 1902, which allows students seeking admission to 
medical schools and faculties to omit examination in classical studies, 
is condemned. The report further confirms the opinion repeatedly 
expressed by leading professors, that the special year of studies lead- 
ing to the certificate of physics, chemistry, and natural science should 
be strictly conformed to the requirements of the medical faculties, 
in accordance with the purposes for which this certificate was created 
(decree of July 31, 1893). 
In regard to the state of the medical faculties themselves, the report 
points out in particular the omission from the course of study of the 
rules of medical ethics, or etiquette (medical deontology), and the 
absence of instruction in bacteriology from the obligatory medical 
course. The latter omission is particularly regretted in the country 
which has given to medical science the results of the investigations 
of Davaine and Pasteur. 
The report also notes the omission from the official programmes of 
stomatology, of the dental art, and of otorhinolaryngology. These 
omissions seem the more inexcusable because France possesses eminent 
specialists who might easily organize courses of instruction in these 
branches which would rival those of other countries and attract 
foreign students by their distinction. 
Provision for instruction in these various specialties exists in 
France under private auspices. The complaint here is of omissions 
in the public system regulated by the Government.* 
The outcome of the work of the medical commission is a decree 
signed by President Falliéres, and issued by the minister of public 
instruction January 11 of the current year, providing for the reor- 
ganization of medical studies in the state faculties and schools of 
medicine. The decree was accompanied by the substance of the report 
of the full commission, setting forth in general terms the reasons for 
and the purposes of the reforms proposed. 
While deprecating the tendency to sweeping criticism of medical 
science and practice in France, in view of the efficiency and distinc- 
tion of French physicians and the excellence of the French medical

-P-A-G-E-453
EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 441 
schools as compared with those of other countries, the report recog- 
nizes certain deficiencies in the existing course of medical study and 
in the equipment of the medical faculties. It is admitted that the 
preparation of the future practitioners is not sufficiently practical 
and that the provision for their technical training has not kept pace 
with the development of medical science. The want of accord be- 
tween the courses of study and the examinations is pointed out, the 
latter favoring “a work almost exclusively bookish and memorized.” 
Clinical exercises and hospital practice are too much neglected. 
These are, in brief, the matters to which the provisions of the recent 
decree are directed. 
The decree requires that all candidates for admission to the medical 
faculties shall have completed the course of secondary studies and 
shall have obtained the bachelor’s degree. This requirement is main- 
tained in the case of all foreign students who wish to practice medi- 
cine in France. 
In addition to the preparatory year of study in the faculty of 
sciences leading to the special certificate in physics, chemistry, and 
natural sciences (the P. C. N.), the student of medicine must com- 
plete the full five-year course. Four years of the course must be 
passed at the seat of the faculty in which the student is inscribed; 
the fifth year may be passed, with the authorization of the faculty, 
in a medical school chosen by the student, either in France or in a 
foreign country. 
The course of study for each year is nine months in duration. 
Every student is required to assist at the appointed clinics and to 
make up the full hospital term. A record of each student’s attend- 
ances (livret scolaire) will be kept, and this record must be forwarded 
to the examining boards for consideration in determining the stand- 
ing of the student in the examinations appointed at the several stages 
of the course, and in the final examination for the diploma. 
The course of study is extended to include the subjects whose pre- 
vious omission has been noted. 
The examinations, according to the report of the commission, 
were the weakest part of the former organization. One of the prin- 
cipal points of criticism is the frequency of the examinations. They 
occurred at intervals throughout each year, and at times when no 
account could be taken of the laboratory and other practical works 
in which the student was expected to bear a part; moreover, the 
arrangement encouraged the habit of hasty preparation by a process 
of cramming. 
Under the new provisions close relation is maintained between the 
courses of study and the examinations by which they are necessarily 
controlled. The examination at the end of the year is reestablished ; 
this becomes, then, the occasion for a methodical review and a sifting 
 
-P-A-G-E-454
  442 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
of the studies pursued. Laboratory and other practical exercises are 
made obligatory parts of the examinations. 
For the multiple examinations allowed each year under the old 
system two annual periods of examination are now appointed; one 
in July, the other in October. With the exception of the clinical 
examinations, no individual or collective examinations are allowed 
at other times. 
These provisions are intended to insure regular attendance and 
serious application on the part of the student, and to relieve the 
professors who are appointed on the examination boards from the 
constant interruption of their professional duties. 
The course of medical instruction prescribed by the decree com- 
prises, (1) under the head of theoretic instruction, the biologic 
sciences; (2) subjects pertaining strictly to medicine and medical 
practice; and (3) pathology, general and special. The theoretic in- 
struction is completed by laboratory exercises, practical demonstra- 
tions, and clinics. 
The report of the commission on medical studies naturally makes 
no allusion to administrative questions, as these were not included in 
the instructions to that body. The situation of the medical faculties 
in this respect, however, is a subject of earnest discussion outside 
administrative circles. The peculiarities of the system and its effect 
upon the development of medical instruction were set forth in an ad- 
dress to the minister of public instruction—unanimously adopted by 
the council of the Paris faculty of medicine during the current year— 
proposing for this faculty a special régime that shall free it from 
external interference. 
THE PARIS FACULTY ON ADMINISTRATIVE REFORM. 
The council of the Paris faculty of medicine considers it a duty to make 
known the actual situation of that body. 
It is the conviction of the council that this situation tends to produce and to 
aggravate the ever-increasing agitations which have so greatly disturbed the 
entire medical fraternity. 
In order that the condition should be understood, it is necessary to recall 
briefly the changes which have taken place in higher education during the last 
twenty years, and which have modified, more or less, the activities of the 
faculties of medicine and lessened their vital force. 
In 1888 the corps of general inspectors of higher education was suppressed 
by a vote of the Chamber of Deputies. But by a decree of April 20, 1888, the 
minister of public instruction was authorized to commit the inspection of the. 
state faculties, from time to time, to members of the consultative committee of 
public instruction, section of higher education. 
It appears that for a number of years the minister has not provided for this 
Service of temporary inspection. He has therefore depended for information 
as to the needs and desires of the faculties of medicine, solely upon the rectors.

EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 443 
In 1896 the universities (formerly isolated faculties) were constituted; the 
decree of July 21, 1897, instituted the councils of the universities. 
Attention is called ta the following articles of this decree: 
“Art. 5. Under the authority of the minister of public instruction the rector 
presents (to the council) matters relative to the university and confirms the 
decisions of the council. 
“Arr. 6, Under the authority of the rector the deans or directors attend to 
the execution of the decisions of the council in respect to matters pertaining 
to the faculties and schools of the university. 
“The council decides: 
“(a) Upon the regulation of independent courses of instruction. 
“(b) Upon the organization and regulation of courses, lectures, and practical 
exercises common to several faculties. 
“(c) Upon the general organization of courses, lectures, and practical exer- 
cises arranged annually by the faculties and schools of the university. 
“The general table of courses of instruction, lectures, and practical exer- 
cises is issued annually by the council in the month of July. It comprises the 
subjects necessary for obtaining the degrees conferred by the State. 
“Art, 12. Every member of the council has the right to express his opinions 
upon questions pertaining to higher education.” 
The council of the faculties of medicine has only the right to express 
opinions or wishes. These opinions are transmitted by the dean of the faculty 
to the rector of the university, who transmits them to the university council; 
the latter in turn transmits them to the ministry. Here they are given over 
either to the consultative committee of public instruction, or to the permanent 
section of the superior council of public instruction, to be finally brought 
before the superior council itself. 
The constitution of these intermediaries—council of the university, con- 
sultative committee, permanent section, superior council of public instruction— 
presents the following features: 
The council of the university comprises: 
1. The rector of the academy (or university), president of the council. 
2. The deans of the faculties and the director of the higher school of pharmacy. 
8. Two delegates from each faculty or school, elected for three years by the 
entire faculty or school from the body of full professors. 
In accordance with this decree the council of the University of Paris com- 
prises 18 members, of whom 3 only are medical men, the great majority, 15, 
are not. 
The consultative committee, section of medicine, with the rector and the 
director of higher education, comprises only 2 medical men, but all are 
appointed by the minister. 
The permanent section comprises 15 members, 13 not belonging to the medical 
profession, 2 graduates in medicine. One of the physicians is elected by the 
faculties, the other is appointed by the minister. 
The superior council of public instruction comprises 53 members; of these 50 
are nonmedical men, 3 belong to the profession. 
Of the 3 physicians, 2 are elected by the faculties, the other is appointed 
by the minister. i 
The numbers above given show what a small proportion of members, compe- 
tent from the medical standpoint, are included in the different bodies in which 
the wishes and opinions of the faculties of medicine are considered. 
Under these conditions, you will see, Mr. Minister, that the fate of the wishes 
of the faculties depends actually upon two competent men. As a consequence, 
 
-P-A-G-E-456
    
444 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
the faculties of medicine have virtually no voice in the administration of their 
affairs. 
The assimilation of the faculties of medicine to the other faculties is a 
mistake. 
The council of the faculty of medicine of Paris urges, therefore, the creation 
of a permanent committee, essentially medical, composed in equal numbers of 
members appointed by the minister and of members elected by all the faculties 
and schools of medicine. 
This committee should be charged to address directly to the minister, after 
examination, all the considerations of interest to medical education, and to 
inform him as to the needs and desires of the faculties and schools of medicine.* 
The system of administration is the same for all faculties, hence 
the above address sets forth a cause of complaint common to all.

INTRODUCTION. 
The Annual Report of the Commissioner of Education for 1908 
contains, in Chapter VIII, entitled “ Education in Central Europe,” 
the results of the latest quinquennial census of the lower schools in 
Prussia, giving, besides the statistics of 1906, those of 1901 and 1896 
to afford opportunities for comparison. In the present chapter the 
school expenditures of the Empire of Germany are shown in com- 
parison with other expenditures of the 26 States (see pp. 446-448). 
The number of public elementary schools in Germany was 61,198, 
attended by 9,779,356 pupils, or 94 per cent of all children of school 
age (6 to 14), leaving 6 per cent in all other schools, private and sec- 
ondary, including home training. Since 1901 the daily attendance 
shows an increase of 9.1 per cent. During the same period the num- 
ber of men teachers increased 10.6 per cent, that of women teachers 
30.5 per cent. The annual average cost per pupil in public elementary 
schools increased from $11.20 in 1901 to $12.86 in 1906. The average 
number of pupils to each teacher was 58 in 1906, some having as high 
as 85 pupils in rural ungraded schools, others as low as 33. 
While in legislative bodies in central Europe efforts are made to 
place public education upon a legal basis where hitherto it had 
rested merely upon ministerial regulations (see pp. 449-452), and 
local authorities and enlightened leaders try to modernize the schools 
by changing them from institutions for the acquisition of knowledge 
to places in which knowledge is applied and work is taught (see pp. 
455-461), experimental psychology, as a practical science, comes to the 
aid of teachers by showing them how to change the method of teach- 
ing so as to save the time and strength of both pupils and teachers 
(see pp. 469-471). 445

446 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
SCHOOL EXPENDITURE OF THE DIFFERENT GERMAN STATES 
COMPARED WITH THEIR ENTIRE EXPENDITURE. 
In the following tables the sums which are stated to be expended 
for schools represent only the State’s quota for schools; neither 
imperial (or federal) nor local expenditures are included. 
It is difficult to place side by side, for the purpose of comparison, 
the expenditures for public education in the 26 German States, and 
those for various other purposes for which the different legislatures 
make annual appropriations. The difficulty arises partly from the 
fact that the governmental departments are not delimited alike in 
their activities; partly from the fact that the departments in German 
state governments are credited with large incomes from the admin- 
istration of railroads, forests, mines, public lands, navigation and 
harbors, postal affairs, telegraphs and telephones, insurance and old- 
age pensions, and numerous other state activities, the balance sheets 
of which have a credit as well as a debit side. Also the payment of 
interest on state debts, payments made to the imperial treasury for 
the support of the Empire and its army and navy, and other things 
have to be considered. All such expenditures should be deducted to 
find a true basis of comparison of the outlay for schools with that 
for other purely state purposes, such as interior administration, 
church, science, justice, and finance, as well as the outlay for exterior 
affairs, i. e., the State’s relations to the Empire, to its sister States, 
and to other countries. (We need to bear in mind that some German 
States maintain their own embassies, or legations, in Berlin, Vienna, 
Rome, and other capitals.) 
Such a careful analysis has been attempted by the Imperial 
Statistical Bureau in Berlin (see “ Vierteljahrsheft zur Statistik des 
deutschen Reichs,” 1908), with the following results:

381, 220, 665 15,791,990 
According to the foregoing table, the current expenditures for 
church, science, and schools amount to 23.6 per cent of the sum total, 
while the extraordinary expenses for the same purposes amount to 
8.6 per cent. In the publication quoted, the sums spent for elementary 
schools exclusively are stated for 1906 (the latest school census) 
for the separate States. (See table below.) The total is a little 
less than $80,000,000, or about one-third of what is appropriated for
-P-A-G-E-459
  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 447 
all three purposes—church, science, and schools. If the local (munici- 
pal) expenditures were added in, the sum for elementary schools 
would be $125,000,000. This sum would not include continuation, 
vocational, and technical schools, for such institutions do not belong 
to the administration of the minister of worship, medical affairs, 
and public education, but to that of the minister of commerce and 
industry. 
A minute comparison, of course, is impossible, for the per cent of 
the State’s quota is not the same for the various departments; but 
the following table, which gives the sums expended for all pur- 
poses (column 8), then for churches and schools separately (columns 
4 and 5), and lastly for the lower schools alone (column 6), enables 
us to see what vast sums are expended for the support of churches, 
and how these sums compare with those spent for education. Col- 
‘umn 5 includes what is spent for the support of secondary and higher 
institutions of learning, also for institutions of scientific investiga- 
tion, hygienic affairs, and art academies and collections; in fact, for 
all institutions tending to increase knowledge, offering a higher ap- 
preciation of life, and securing comfort and health, i. e., all institu- 
tions over which the minister of worship, medical affairs, and public 
education holds sway.

448 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
There are great differences in the proportionate outlay for churches 
and schools in the German States, as is seen from the foregoing table. 
Thus, for instance, Prussia, as a State, pays for the lower schools 
about one-half the sum spent for all kinds of educational institutions; 
Bavaria pays more than two-thirds for lower schools; Baden only 
one-third; Hesse not much more; Mecklenburg-Schwerin only one- 
sixth. The expenditures for churches amount to not quite one-third 
of the sum the state government spent for elementary schools in Prus- 
sia; in Bavaria the proportion is more than one-half; in Hesse one- 
sixth; in Mecklenburg-Schwerin it is higher than that for the lower 
schools. The State and city of Bremen pay nothing for churches; 
Hamburg a very small sum. In Alsace-Lorraine the amount paid 
for the support of churches is very high, because, according to local 
French laws still in force, clergymen and all clerical officers are paid 
by the State. 
ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS IN AUSTRIA. 
The Oesterreichische Schulbote (Vienna) published in October, 
1908, a detailed statement of the state expenditures for elementary 
schools in Cisleithania (Austria proper—that is, without Hungary). 
The total state expenditures for the year 1906 for education of all 
kinds, elementary, secondary, higher, and special, so far as the insti- 
tutions are subject to governmental supervision, amounted to 
279,582,000 crowns, or $56,755,146. This does not include many pri- 
vate schools, nor many special vocational schools established and 
maintained by private endowments or communal initiative. The 
population of Austria proper being, according to the census of 1905, 
27,238,053, the per capita of population, therefore, was $2.09. The 
total amount spent for elementary schools alone was 121,058,000 
crowns, or $24,574,774; hence a per capita of $0.90. The various 
States, or crown lands, participated in this as follows:

  The total number of elementary teachers was 69,555. This does 
not include teachers of private schools nor those of elementary classes 
in secondary schools, nor does it include several States or crown lands 
mentioned at the foot of the first table. It is only the teachers under 
governmental supervision of the States or crown lands mentioned 
which are included in the total of 69,555; the number of teachers, 
with all the additions indicated, would be 91,808. 
          
      
    
  SCHOOL LEGISLATION IN CERTAIN GERMAN STATES. 
The legislature of the State of Oldenburg (population 488,856 in 
1905) has been discussing a bill concerning the state school system, 
during the winter session of 1908-9, which proposes to place the 
administration and superior supervision of educational institutions, 
except continuation and vocational schools, in the hands of the grand 
ducal ministers of education—that is, into the hands of the Prot- 
estant government bureau at the city of Oldenburg and the Catholic 
9228—rp 1909—voL 1——29    
    
      
         
           
-P-A-G-E-462
       450 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
school commission at Vechta. According to the bill, the use of new 
text or school books for religious education shall be permitted only 
if these two authorities sanction their introduction. The local ad- 
ministration of elementary schools is given over to the local boards, 
which consist of the mayor, the parish pastor, the school principal, 
and from two to four elected citizens serving for six years. 
Direct professional supervision is provided for, but the religious 
instruction is supervised by the parish pastor or priest, and the 
maximum number of pupils allowed is 70 to a teacher. This does 
not prescribe that there shall be 70 pupils in each class room, but 
it means that if the number of children enrolled in any district 
exceeds 70, there shall be made provision for an additional school- 
room at once. The bill provides for better salaries for teachers— 
i. e., from $300 to $600 for principals, with a suitable dwelling and 
garden land, or indemnity for rent amounting to about 20 per cent 
of the salary, and a local addition of $40 per year for a number of 
years. For class teachers the salary is fixed at from $250 to $540, 
plus 20 per cent rent indemnity and a certain number of annual 
increases of $35 each. 
All ancient, private, and semiprivate endowments are definitely 
handed over to the civil community, which takes upon itself the 
maintenance of the schools in connection with the state government, 
which latter derives its moral and legal right to supervision and 
direction through its quota to the school support. Local school 
supervision by religious bodies, through clergymen, is done away 
with, except so far as lessons in denominational religion in prepara- 
tion for church confirmation are concerned. This division of the 
duties of school supervision and general management seems to be 
the final solution in German States of the vexing question whether 
school supervision shall be conducted by the clergy or by professional 
teachers. 
The State of Wurttemberg (population 2,302,179) also is pre- 
paring a new school law. So far as religion is concerned, the legis- 
lature follows the principle for which all German States, including 
Prussia, have declared, namely, that of separate schools for Cath- 
olics and Protestants, as well as for Jews in cities where enough 
Jewish children are found to open a separate school. The subjects 
of the course of study for elementary schools (so-called Volks- 
schulen) are determined by the bill. History, geography, nature 
study, and gymnastics for boys, branches which hitherto rested on 
ministerial decrees only, now receive statutory sanction as obligatory 
subjects; elementary geography, drawing, and handiwork for girls 
also become obligatory. As optional studies are named manual 
training for boys, accompanied by “ working drawings,” and gym-    
   
                         
-P-A-G-E-463
    
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 451 
nastics and domestic economy (housekeeping, including cooking) for 
girls. 
From this it is apparent that the course is being enriched. The 
bill recognizes intermediate schools (Mittelschulen), the characteristic 
of which is instruction in a modern foreign language, and auxiliary 
schools (Hilfsschulen) for abnormal or weak-minded children. It is 
left to the authorities of the school districts to establish such schools 
or not, and it is left to the parents to decide whether they will make 
use of them for their children. Another paragraph of the bill is 
significant. It bestows upon the communities the right to extend the 
compulsory attendance act to the beginning of the sixteenth year of 
life. This is done to keep boys and girls under observation in 
vocational schools during the age of adolescence and apprenticeship. 
Like Oldenburg, the State of Wurttemberg reduces the maximum 
number of pupils per teacher. It was formerly 90; it will be 70 if 
the bill becomes a law. Imperial statistics for 1906 show that in 
Prussia the average number of pupils per teacher was 60, in Bavaria 
58, in Saxony 61, in Wurttemberg 57, in Baden 64, in Hesse 57. 
The minister of public instruction of Wurttemberg submitted to the 
legislature also another school bill, which deals with the reform of the 
professional training of teachers. The normal-school course is pro- 
longed to six years, and the instruction given is to be greatly improved 
and deepened. It is proposed to devote the sixth year to more 
language and literature, to a more extensive study of pedagogy 
through practice in the model school, and to the study of methods 
of child study and self-activity. The normal-school course will 
thereby receive an extension, such as can be found in Saxony, in the 
three free cities, and in the western provinces of Prussia. 
The Kingdom of Saxony (population 4,508,601) also contemplates 
a revision of its school law, and a bill is being prepared by the govern- 
ment to be laid before the legislature early in 1909. Smaller states, 
like Saxe-Weimar (population 388,095) and others, have already 
revised their school laws, and everywhere in Germany, either by 
statute or by decree, changes are made which are intended to improve 
the education of the people, though these changes involve heavier 
burdens of expenditure for communities and the State. 
In Switzerland (which is mentioned in this connection merely to 
indicate that the democratic form of government succeeds in solv- 
ing school problems in a more radical way) the question of sectarian 
instruction in school has been settled by the constitution, namely: 
Each child, as it enters school, brings a statement signed by father 
or guardian, which determines whether or not the child is to receive 
religious instruction; if so, whether Catholic or Protestant. . At 
stated hours during the week the parish pastor or priest comes to
-P-A-G-E-464
  452 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
the school and gives the lessons, while the teacher is freed from teach- 
ing religion. In all other branches the schools are common schools, 
pupils of all denominations sitting side by side. The Swiss seem to 
be very well satisfied with this solution; at any rate clergymen of all 
denominations meet on common ground, and difficulties arising from 
lack of harmony between teachers and clergymen have entirely 
ceased to agitate the communities. 
TEACHERS’ SALARIES IN PRUSSIA. 
The final result of the deliberations in the lower house of the 
Prussian legislature, concerning the remuneration of teachers in the 
lower schools, though it does not come up to the expectations of the 
teachers, is after all quite a step forward. The minimum salary for 
men class teachers (that is, at the beginning of their careers) is to 
be 1,400 marks (about $333), for women class teachers 1,200 marks 
($286). There are two annual increases of 200 marks, then two of 
250 marks, and after that five of 200 marks, making a total increase 
of 1,900 marks ($452), and a total salary of 3,300 marks ($785.50) 
for men after nine years of service; the increases for women make a 
total salary of 2,450 marks ($582). 
To these sums must be added 700 marks ($166.60) for rectors or 
principals of fully graded schools, 200 marks ($47.60) for principals 
of schools of four to five grades, and 100 marks ($23.80) for teachers 
of ungraded schools. There should be added, also, reimbursements 
for rent in cases where the schoolhouse contains no suitable dwelling 
accommodations for the teachers. This indemnity amounts to 800 
marks ($190.40) in cities of the first class, 650 marks ($154.70) in 
cities of the second class, 540 marks ($128.50) in cities of the third 
class, 450 marks ($107.10) in cities of the fourth class, and 330 marks 
($78.50) in cities of the fifth class. 
A man teacher may therefore get $785.50, plus $166.60, plus 
$190.40, or a total of $1,142.50 a year, during the last five, ten, or 
fifteen years of his service, and retire as principal on a pension of 
75 per cent of his last year’s salary, which is $856.80. In Germany, 
where the purchasing power of money is far greater than here, these 
sums are considered not only a great improvement over salaries and 
pensions of former years, but quite an adequate income. 
The teachers are gratified to hear that a paragraph in the new law 
specifically states that in computing a teacher’s pension these rent 
indemnities shall be considered integral parts of the salaries, which 
in many cases was not done formerly. This, of course, increases the 
pensions considerably, and since the State alone pays the pensions, 
the increases are secure from local favor or disfavor.

Teachers all over Germany look hopefully toward Prussia, as a 
law of this kind will act as an example for other States of the Empire. 
That this is desirable may be seen from the following comparative 
table, which gives the salaries for elementary school teachers in the 
four largest States of Germany. The salaries mentioned do not in- 
clude indemnity for rent, nor extra pay for principals; they include 
only the cash pay of class teachers.

NEW MINISTERIAL REGULATIONS CONCERNING INSTRUCTION IN 
PRUSSIAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS, 
The Prussian minister of public instruction, Doctor Holle, issued 
in 1908 new regulations concerning the manner in which elementary 
instruction is to be given. They are based on the course of study 
adopted in 1872, do not go into the minutiz, demand nothing new, but 
in a general way point out in what way time and labor may be saved, 
and they infuse, so to speak, a new spirit into matter and method of 
the schools. Since the regulations are addressed to the supervisory 
authorities, it stands to reason that they will urge the teachers to 
change their customary methods to conform their work to the min- 
ister’s order. 
The old maxim, “Through self-activity to self-dependence,” is 
especially emphasized by the minister. He orders more attention to 
be paid to self-activity on the part of the pupils, independent action 
in form of reciting, measuring, computing, framing rules of their 
own, and choosing their own mode in writing down what has been 
learned. Everywhere through the new regulations is observable the 
strong desire to kill mechanism, routine, and Procrustean procedure 
of any kind. Hitherto, says the order, the teachers used the Socratic  
-P-A-G-E-466
  454 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
method of questioning and answering orally too exclusively. They 
guided the children too much, and thus prevented spontaneity. 
He wants the teachers to let the pupils have more liberty to use 
their own words, orally and in writing. This has been the weakest 
point in German schools. The method in use creates cognitions well 
enough, transmits knowledge, but it fails to awaken spontaneity and 
clear judgment, nor does it set in action the child’s individual powers. 
By giving the pupils much freedom to select their own form of ex- 
pression, they will acquire the power to apply in practice whatever 
knowledge they have gained. Doctor Kuypers, in his comparison of 
German and American school methods, touches upon the fact that 
in American schools less guidance and more self-action is found. 
This produces the power to help one’s self and to judge for one’s self. 
The new order also urges the teachers to make their pupils ac- 
quainted with home and its environments; plants, animals, minerals 
of the neighborhood should be learned by bringing the natural 
objects into class or by taking the class on little excursions into the 
country. Lessons in the open air are recommended, in school gardens 
and during walks through the parks and the woods. Again, self- 
activity is urged by advising the beginning of collections of natural 
objects brought to school by the pupils. 
With reference to the criticism that the schools had too great a 
variety of subjects and that too much matter was prescribed to be 
memorized, as, for instance, a large number of hymns, Bible verses, 
and the whole of the catechism, the new order relieves the school by 
restricting the amount; and, as to grammatical matter, the minister 
seems to think that the lower schools have hitherto tried in vain to 
stem the tide of dialectic speech, and hence he suggests less dry gram- 
mar and more live speech. 
For arithmetic he orders that the excessive work in common frac- 
tions be curtailed as “ unnecessary.” The practical demands of life 
should determine the matter to be gone over in arithmetic, and in 
calling the pupils to frame and solve problems consideration should 
be paid to actual conditions of life. In the upper grades the chief 
object in arithmetic is to make children solve problems by means of 
their own methods, not merely by conventional methods; further- 
more, rules should not be dictated, but discovered. Self-thinking, © 
self-acting are recommended by the minister for no branch more than 
for arithmetic and mensuration. He suggests to save time by drop- 
ping the senseless practice of dealing mechanically with large sums, 
with arbitrary measures, and especially the practice of juggling with 
large common fractions. 
History, which has always been an important branch in the lower 
schools of Germany, both native and foreign, is curtailed in the fol- 
lowing words: “In lessons in history presentations from ancient
-P-A-G-E-467
  
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 455 
times and the middle ages shall be restricted to a few of the most 
important biographies.” With regard to religious instruction the 
minister says: “ Lifeless (geistloses) memorizing shall not be toler- 
ated, and in matters which require memorizing an overcharge of the 
memory must be avoided.” 
In all these branches time may be saved which may be utilized 
in more frequent reviews of important matters, especially in history, 
geography, and practical arithmetic. Time saved may also be used 
in applying modern matters and methods, such as nature study, bio- 
logical work, physiology, and hygiene. “ Quite in harmony with the 
demands of the present time,” says the minister, “ Germany’s colonies, 
her world-wide commerce, and modern modes of transportation be- 
tween the chief commercial centers should be given consideration. 
In instruction in history it is not the exterior development of the 
country’s power so much as the internal development of the organiza- 
tions whose aims are the social welfare of the people, which should be 
discussed.” 
The minister shows in this new order that he is cognizant of the 
numerous criticisms to which the German public schools have been 
subjected by men and women who have visited foreign countries, 
especially those who came to study the American schools during the 
St. Louis Exposition, including Doctor Pabst, of Leipzig, Doctor 
Kuypers, of Cologne, Councilor Dunker, of Berlin, and many others, 
who frankly pointed out the weak spots in the German schools. 
THE SCHOOL OF THE FUTURE A SCHOOL FOR WORK. 
[Dr. Georg Kerschensteiner, superintendent of schools in Munich, in an address con- 
tributes to the problem of changing the character of popular education, so that it may 
better prepare for industrial pursuits than hitherto, a solution which finds great approval 
all over the German Empire. That solution is in fact an adaptation of an American ideal 
of public-school education, carried into effect in many cities of this country. Doctor 
Kerschensteiner delivered his address on the occasion of the Pestalozzi celebration in 
Zurich, Switzerland, a circumstance which gives evidence of the close contact of German 
and Swiss currents of educational thought. The Piudagogische Blitter, in which the 
following abstract of his address appeared (No. 3, 1908), says: ‘‘ We have had frequent 
occasion to refer with approval to Doctor Kerschensteiner’s efforts to change the present 
school, which deals only with words and confines itself to the transmission of book 
knowledge, to a school that sets free the productive energies of the pupils. The dis- 
tinguishing features of his Zurich address are, on the one hand, the excellent logical 
basis of his demand, and, on the other hand, the information he furnishes as to what has 
already been done at Munich in order to carry out the idea,’’] 
During the period of elementary school age, as in his previous 
childhood years, the pupil is by no means disposed merely to listen, 
and passively to take in the knowledge of others. On the contrary, 
the years of childhood, up to the age of puberty, are usually dis- 
tinguished by lively activity. The tendencies of the human being at 
this period are toward work, occupation, doing, testing, experiment- 
ing, personal experience, in order to learn incessantly through the  
-P-A-G-E-468
  
  456 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
medium of actuality. The whole untiring play life of the child is 
the direct outcome of a natural, instinctive tendency toward the 
development of the mental and physical powers under the influence 
of vital experiences of every kind. Especially where children are 
not cooped up within the sepulchral walls of a large city, they are all 
initiative. They discover ever new fields for the indulgence of their 
desire for occupation, and forget all the world in its exercise. Ninety 
per cent of the boys and girls, in spite of every effort of book educa- 
tion, prefer by far any practical occupation to silent abstract thought 
and reflection. With them the saying, practice is better than theory— 
Probiren geht iiber Studiren—still retains its full value. Only when 
other people’s knowledge contributes to success in their efforts do they 
prick up their ears to listen; then they devour even books, and not 
story books alone. In the workshop and in the kitchen, in the garden 
and in the field, in the stable and in the fishing boat, they are ever 
ready to work. There they find their richest field for learning. There 
they find the thousand things which their developing intellect eagerly 
seizes; there hundreds of accomplishments are developed and appre- 
hended by the unconscious muscular sense; there they feel, above all, 
the pulsations of social life in their own activities. There they be- 
come conscious of the relations which community life establishes be- 
tween persons, and of the dependence of the smaller upon the greater, 
as well as of the greater upon the smaller ; there they learn to help and 
to welcome their own folks and the stranger, to comfort the sad, to 
feed the hungry, to sustain the weary, to encourage the despondent, 
and, just as in their plays, to strive together, to organize for common 
effort, and to subordinate themselves willingly. 
And now the school opens its doors. Gone is every occupation that 
had engaged the whole child; gone are all the actualities of home, 
of workshop, of kitchen, of stable, of garden, of field. Gone is all 
digging, building, making, every productive activity—gone the whole 
world of the child. A new, strange world with a hundred riddles 
and incomprehensible demands and purposes stands before him. In- 
stead of the sand pile, the building blocks, the scissors, the hammer, 
the whip—slate, pencil, primer, ruler; instead of merry chatting and 
romancing—silence and listening; instead of the free range of 
thought in the outer world—strict attention and holding the mind in 
fixed direction; instead of discovering, trying, experimenting, mak- 
ing—imitation; instead of merry bustle in road and street—sitting 
still and holding fast; instead of common enterprise under freely 
chosen leaders—solitary, prescribed tasks; instead of helping the 
weak neighbor—deliberate isolation that he may not copy. Is it 
surprising if the little ones at first stand aghast and feel lost, if they 
become reticent instead of open minded, if their thoughts roam far

away beyond the four walls of the schoolroom in spite of the best 
intentions, in spite of admonitions and punishments? 
Fortunately, in most instances, a gentle-hearted teacher watches 
over them, and catches the shy birds with love and kindness, removes 
from their way the big stones that hinder them in their progress on 
' the new and unaccustomed road to knowledge. And the millstones 
of systematic method grind the hard grains of strange and uninter- 
esting knowledge into flour and pulp, so that even the weakest may 
absorb the new food. Gradually most of the children become accus- 
tomed to the new island of knowledge, to which they paddle twice 
a day from the continent of their natural sphere of experience, but 
to which they know not how to build a bridge. Nay, more—they 
become accustomed to their methods of work and learn to like them. 
Instead of consorting with actual things, they learn to deal with their 
shadows; the place of the world of experience is occupied by book 
knowledge, with the wreaths of honor that the school bestows upon it; 
the place of the former bold spirit of enterprise in treading unbeaten 
paths of discovery is taken by arduous labor in familiar and well- 
worn tracks; the place of observation, of research, and of doubt is 
taken by swearing by the words of the master. 
I should be guilty of injustice were I to ignore the advantages 
which the school of to-day yields in education, advantages that flow 
from habituation to work not originally desired, from the fixed 
organization of the life of the school with its minute regulations, its 
unyielding severity. Surely the children can here acquire valuable 
traits of character which we would by no means miss—punctuality, 
conscientiousness, painstaking, perseverance, regularity, self-control. 
It must, indeed, be conceded that these moral traits are apt to thrive 
just where the school does not follow exclusively the inclinations of 
the pupils, provided the sun of a friendly teacher’s heart shines 
over all. 
On the other hand, the school of to-day fails to give to the child, 
as it enters life, and rather inhibits than fosters, certain active traits 
of character which most of the children already possessed in embryo 
when they entered school—the courage of self-reliance, the courage 
of self-assertion and of the spirit of enterprise, the courage to deal 
with the new and strange, eagerness to observe and to verify, and, 
above all, the eagerness to work, not for themselves alone, not merely 
that they may grow, that they might surpass others and be victo- 
rious in the fierce struggle of life, but also that they might place 
their own rich powers at the disposal of all who need their help. 
And thus the question arises: Is it not possible so to transform the 
school of to-day that it may not lose its good features, but neverthe- 
less become more considerate of the nature of the child, and also 
 
-P-A-G-E-470
  458 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
develop those active tendencies of his soul which are now neglected 
and even permitted to wither? This can only be accomplished if 
from the very beginning we appeal in all our instruction, more 
than heretofore, to the productive energy of the child, and this, 
so far as feasible, within the same range of activities to which he 
is bound before and during the school period by his personal capaci- 
ties and economic environment. As to the little child the play room 
of the home is the workshop of his mind, where the thousands of 
impressions and stimuli are wrought into an outer, objective world, 
thus to the older child the workroom of the school should be the cen- 
tral workshop of his activity, from which he gladly turns to the 
study rooms of the school in order to return ever again to the work- 
rooms freighted with new treasures which he spontaneously sought. 
Our study school must become a work school that is articulated 
with the play school of earlier childhood. 
[Now, although the school of to-day also demands work from the child, it 
must be remembered that this is essentially mental work, which, on the whole, 
appeals exclusively to the intellect.] 
What the new work school needs is, in addition to the purely 
intellectual field of work, a rich field of manual work. For in this. 
by far the greater number of human beings find their fertile field of 
development and support. The school needs, furthermore, those 
kinds of work which as much as possible are connected with the 
economic or domestic work activities of the parents, so that the 
threads which the school spins may not be broken daily when the 
child returns home. In the third place, the school needs work in 
the service of the fellow-pupils, which from the first day ever and 
again preaches the injunction, life means not dominion, but serv- 
ice! Not until the work of the school bears this escutcheon of nobil- 
ity can it become the foundation of education for citizenship, of an 
education which every patriot must demand as the first and foremost 
requirement of the school, and which heretofore, like so many other 
things, we have thought to find in the mere word. Only common 
effort yields the feeling of common responsibility, the feeling of the 
necessity of subordination under common purposes. With that feel- 
ing the school enters the warp of social life, into which the shuttle 
of instruction drives the same thousands of threads and in the same 
intersections, as the well-ordered home life of the child with its readi- 
ness for service, its subordination, its devotion, its unselfish love. 
Not for the sake of the various manual accomplishments only do 
we need the workrooms; not that our compatriots may retain interest 
in practical work; not that the children may learn to plane, saw, file, 
bore, sew, weave, and cook; not that they may love the work of their 
hands; no, we need it, above all else, that we may educate human 
beings, who will appreciate the purpose and value of national unity
-P-A-G-E-471
    
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 459 
to its roots, and gratefully give it service. We need it, because cul- 
ture does not rest on the book, but on work, on devoted, self-sacri- 
ficing work in the service of fellow-men, or of a great truth. 
We need it also because of the greatly varying endowments of the 
children. For only when we take account of these will our education 
and instruction be successful; when we fail to do so, we can only 
painfully drill. The Mannheim system of school organization in its 
full extent is expedient only in the study school and the instruction 
of pupils in mass connected with it. In the workshop, in the lab- 
oratory, in the school kitchen, in the school garden, in the room for 
drawing, in the music room, every child finds the work it is able to do. 
Here the weak works at the side of the strong, and is helped by him, 
or can or should be so helped. Here, side by side, the younger and 
the older children can feel the joy and the value of success in work 
adapted to their several degrees of ability. Here they need not all 
march in rank and file. For here, where mere memory work is elim- 
inated, the value of the outcome of the work is of less moment than 
the value of the method of work. Here “ individualizing of instruc- 
tion,” heretofore the most deceptive pet phrase of our mass organiza- 
tion of listeners, requires no effort on the teacher’s part; here it 
appears spontaneously. 
[Doctor Kerschensteiner is not satisfied with mere theory. What he has 
actually accomplished he relates as follows:] 
First of all, in 1896 I succeeded in making instruction in cooking 
an obligatory subject in four weekly lessons in all the eighth grades 
for girls, and in gaining from this a fund of experience for the in- 
struction in chemistry, physics, and physiology, as well as arithmetic 
for the girls. A few years later school gardens were established in 
all the schools whose yards permitted this. Among these the care of 
the school kitchen gardens was assigned especially to the girls of the 
eighth grades. At about the same time the aquaria, terraria, bird 
cages, and caterpillar boxes were introduced into the schools, as well 
as the care of flowers in the third and fourth grades, among the pupils 
of which more than 10,000 bulbs were distributed for cultivation 
yearly. 
Then, in 1900, we succeeded in connecting with all eighth-grade 
boys’ classes workshops for wood and metal work, with six obligatory 
weekly lessons. These furnished, in the next place, the store of expe- 
rience for drawing, for instruction in mechanics, geometry, and 
arithmetic. In 1903 the reform of instruction in drawing was begun, 
which from the beginning was placed in the service of decorative art, 
and, thereby, of the productivity of the child, a venture in which I 
was more and more encouraged by my extensive researches in the 
development of the talent for drawing in the child.  
-P-A-G-E-472
  460 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
Finally, last year, we succeeded after fierce struggles in establishing 
also for physics and chemistry obligatory laboratory instruction for 
the eighth grades, with four lessons weekly. This, in spite of the 
violent attacks to which it is still exposed, will not only persist, but 
will sooner or later be established also in the seventh and sixth 
grades. This will depend, above all else, on the spirit of the instruc- 
tion, on the manner in which the teachers conduct it, for whom 
it signifies a wholly new way of teaching. If the experiment is suc- 
cessful, of which I have no fear, the following years will raise the 
question whether it will not also be possible to utilize workshop 
instruction in the service of laboratory instruction, as already to-day 
sand boxes are found to be valuable in the service of geography. 
Thus, step by step, the ground is being dug away from under the old- 
time book instruction, and I am full of hope that the unconquerable 
idealism of our teachers and the irrepressible force of the old yet 
ever new idea will steadily increase the tendency toward the trans- 
formation of the old school routine. 
When I see the beaming eyes, the glowing cheeks, and the irre- 
pressible delight in work of the boys and girls in our workshops and 
laboratories, in our school kitchens and school gardens, I see therein 
the best proof of the fact that we are on the right road. There even 
those wake up who, sitting at their desks, were looked upon as indo- 
lent, stupid, or negligent, and who, doubtless, would have been 
assigned to classes for the backward had we possessed such. Nay, 
with us it is not of rare occurrence that such troublesome children 
far surpass their fellow-pupils gifted with better memory, and that 
their success, and the praise that never had come to them before, 
arouses them from their indolence and their dream life, so that hence- 
forth they try to devote themselves to their intellectual work with 
greater interest. What dreary languor prevailed even six years ago 
in our drawing lessons, when the straight line, the arc of the circle, 
the geometrical figure, the abstract ornament occupied the throne 
of art, and the real talent, as well as the creative fervor of every 
child, was at a loss as to what to do with them! How different all 
this became, when the things of the home, of the workshop, and of © 
_the garden entered, and the children could exercise their love for 
drawing and their creative instinct in the construction and decora- 
tion of things of daily use, the weak with their scanty means, the 
gifted with the entire wealth of their imagination! What an atmos- 
phere of joy pervades to-day all the drawing classes; what an 
amount of decorative and constructive inventive talent is suddenly 
liberated and leaps from the formerly so isolated school island over 
into the home life, like the flaming sparks of a great conflagration, 
that fire all things combustible within their reach! With what
-P-A-G-E-473
  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 461 
delight individual children now lug to their classes even their home 
work, and surprise teachers and fellow-pupils with proofs of skill 
which no one had suspected before ! 
The greatest progress in the transformation of the study school into 
a work school has been made in Munich, in our supplementary or 
continuation schools for boys. There in reality the boy, with all his 
practical interests, is at the center; there all instruction has its source 
in the workshops and again returns to them; there an actual trade 
or vocational school is possible, which will be forever excluded from 
the elementary school. In consequence of the strict organization 
on the basis of trades that brings together only boys of the same 
occupation, the workshops are at once pervaded with the spirit of 
common interest and solidarity, and, because of the evident devotion 
of masters and journeymen to the task of instruction, also with the 
spirit of confidence and mutual respect. At first the new arrange- 
ments were the occasion of much scoffing and disparagement; but 
already to-day scorn and jest have been silenced, for the value of the 
work appears ever more clearly. Even to-day, it is true, there are 
those who call my laboratories useless play, and who put serious 
obstacles in the way of their establishment. But the time will come, 
as surely as the day follows the night, when men will not understand 
how it was ever possible to teach otherwise. 
[ When, in another place, Doctor Kerschensteiner says that it will be possible 
to realize these ideas more easily when “ the education of teachers itself shall 
be permeated by the wholly new spirit of the work school,” he touches upon a 
problem which normal schools are beginning to appreciate in its full im- 
portance. Prussian and Saxon normal schools are attempting to conduct their 
instruction in natural sciences on the proposed basis. May they be successful. 
For that these ideas will rule the future, Doctor Kerschensteiner’s address has 
clearly shown.] 
RESULTS OF SCHOOL EDUCATION IN PRUSSIA. 
The Annual Report of the Commissioner for 1907 contains, in a 
chapter on education in Central Europe (Chapter V), an account of 
an examination of elementary pupils whom the compulsory-attendance 
act had drawn into the continuation (or evening) schools, and who, it 
was alleged, were insufliciently prepared for the work in industrial 
and commercial continuation schools. The results of this and similar 
examinations were made the subject of an interesting parliamentary 
debate in the Prussian Diet on the occasion of considering the appro- 
priation bill for the department of public education. Extracts from 
that debate may show that the question of popular education is 
quite as important in Prussia now as it was in the early part of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-474
  462 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
nineteenth century, and also that the Germans indulge in self- 
criticism without reserve. 
The following is a synopsis of the proceedings of the Prussian 
house of representatives on elementary continuation and normal 
schools, February 17, 1908. The discussion dealt with the motion of 
Representatives Schiffer (of the National Liberal party), Fischbeck 
(Liberal People’s party), and Ernst (Liberal Union party) request- 
ing the government to furnish detailed information concerning (1) 
the results of recent inquiries made by the minister of commerce as to 
the pupils’ preparation for continuation schools; (2) the attitude 
of the minister of instruction with reference to these results; (8) the 
measures for remedying shortcomings in the elementary schools 
that may have been revealed. 
Scuirrer (National Liberal) declared that essentially this motion, 
like a similar one which in the preceding session of the house had 
been abruptly referred to a committee and not acted upon by the 
latter, related to certain investigations that were made, the first one 
in 1904, by the minister of commerce as chief of the Prussian in- 
dustrial bureau. At that time, in response to complaints of teachers 
of the continuation schools, examinations were undertaken in the 
spring of 1904; 4,336 papers in the German language and 4,332 in 
arithmetic were gathered in. The result was summed up by the 
minister of commerce in the statement, “On the whole, results are not 
satisfactory.” Taking into account the naturally cautious phrase- 
ology of high responsible officials, the speaker found in this expres- 
sion “a most incisive criticism of the work of the pupils of the 
continuation schools,” and pointed out that naturally this criticism 
applied ultimately also to the elementary schools; for, inasmuch as 
it concerned pupils who had just entered the continuation schools, 
badly taught pupils of these schools are badly taught pupils of the 
elementary schools. 
A further investigation, the speaker went on to say, was made in 
the following year by the German Association for Commercial In- 
struction. It extended to 6,109 pupils. The result was extremely 
unsatisfactory; about two-thirds of the examined pupils could not, 
in their work, reach the mark of sufficiency. 
In the following year the minister of commerce ordered a second, a more 
extended and more thorough, investigation, from which 16,000 examination 
papers were gathered in. Doubts that had been expressed with reference to 
the first inquiry had been fully considered; the examination questions had been 
specialized; it was taken into account whether or not the pupil had completed 
the course of the elementary school; notice was taken of local conditions, and 
also of the fact whether or not some years had elapsed since the completion 
of the course of the elementary school on the pupils’ part. This material was 
collected a year ago, It was subjected to a preliminary examination, which
-P-A-G-E-475
  
  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 463 
confirmed the results of the former inquiries. The entire material was then 
turned over to the Prussian statistical bureau, since which a year has elapsed. 
Assuming that there had been sufficient time to complete the work, 
the speaker desired to know, in the first place, from the minister of 
commerce what were the results; but he also wished to know the 
attitude of the minister of instruction toward the question at issue. 
The investigation did not, indeed, cover the entire field; yet things 
were evidently not what they ought to be, if three successive though 
partial investigations yielded the same unfavorable results. This 
view was confirmed “by the general opinion among industrial and 
professional men, who are loud in their complaints concerning the 
educational equipment of the young people.” He continued: 
Instruction in our schools rests upon antiquated and, therefore, false regu- 
lations and rules. The equipment of the schools is usually confined to a 
minimum—a map of the home province, one of Germany, one of Palestine. A 
map of Europe is not prescribed, nor one of the hemispheres of the earth. 
Consequently, if the local community refuses, the Government can not demand 
them, and this in a time of our present world commerce and of our colonial 
policy. This brings me to the neglect of object teaching. It will become 
necessary for us to inquire whether there is not an excess of memorizing in 
our schools. Again, in its external relations, the elementary school demands 
improvement. The overcrowding of classes interferes in many ways with the 
attainment of the ends in view. Furthermore, it is complained that excessive 
and too formal supervision compels show work, which endangers a continuous 
development and consideration of the individuality of pupils. The questions 
of the lack of teachers, of the frequent change of teachers, of the emigration 
of teachers, of the organization of teachers—all these have their bearing. 
* * * On the problem of popular instruction rests the entire future of the 
State. The thorough instruction of our youth is not a luxury, nor is it a mere 
historic obligation upon us as the nation of thinkers; it is a bitter and serious 
necessity. Therefore we expect that the educational committee will take this 
difficult problem in hand promptly and effectively. 
The minister of instruction, Docror Hotxz, in reply stated that, 
according to a communication from the minister of commerce, the 
results of the last examination of the pupils of the continuation 
schools were not as yet worked out; that in this matter he was in 
perfect accord with his colleague, and that both of them did not 
consider the results of the examination satisfactory for the elementary 
schools, But he emphasized the fact that in many cities the examina- 
tions were not general, but children were tested here and there at 
hazard; and that a large part of the pupils had completed the work 
of the elementary school a considerable time before entering the con- 
tinuation school, hence had perhaps forgotten much. He continued: 
Nevertheless it must be admitted that the collective result of this examination 
justifies general conclusions, and among these is the one that, unfortunately, 
the pupils of the elementary school leave school with varying educational 
attainments. The reasons for this are manifest: The differences in home con-
-P-A-G-E-476
  464 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
ditions, in talents, in diligence, etc. The results attained in different schools 
are naturally extremely varied. The overcrowded half-day school can not 
achieve the results which a well-organized school of six classes, with efficient 
teachers, can reach. This leads to the conclusion that it must be exceedingly 
difficult to establish a uniform method of instruction in the continuation 
schools for pupils whose attainments are so varied. That the pupils leave the 
elementary schools with different acquirements is explained, therefore, by 
existing conditions. 
This is a problem which probably will never be fully solved. But the educa- 
tional administration should constantly strive to raise the average outcomé. 
In this, in the first place, external measures are to be considered, such as 
reduction of distance from the schools, the avoidance of overcrowded classes, 
ete. One obstacle in this is found in the manifold diversity and vagueness of 
the legislation on the subject. The new law regulating the maintenance of the 
elementary schools will furnish a firm basis for improvement. I would also 
point to the increase of the fund for the establishment of new positions for 
teachers from 300,000 to 400,000 marks. My predecessor deserves much praise 
for his efforts to meet the lack of teachers. From 1901 to 1907 the number of 
teachers’ seminaries has been increased from 118 to 156; but the course em- 
braces a period of six years, and the benefits of the measure will, therefore, 
appear only gradually. I hope that the house will join us in our efforts, and 
continue its support in the establishment of new seminaries. 
However, there is needed improvement, too, in the inner conditions of the 
elementary school. For this purpose the new course of study for the training 
of elementary teachers was issued in 1901. This, too, can demonstrate its 
value only gradually, because annually only a relatively small number of new 
teachers enter the schools. It is, furthermore, my opinion that teachers fre- 
quently do not adequately adjust their instruction to local conditions, and only 
recently I directed their attention to this point. The differences among the 
pupils and the differences in domestic conditions will, however, always operate 
against a complete solution of this problem. Yet we should endeavor to come 
as near our ideal as possible. To employ its whole energy in this direction 
should ever be the endeavor of the administration. I hope that with the help 
of the teachers we shall succeed in this. 
Von Drrrurru (of the Conservative party) promised the support 
of his political friends in all that concerned the welfare of the ele- 
mentary schools; he was not prepared, however, to acknowledge on 
the basis of the results of the investigation that there were serious 
defects in the organization of the elementary schools. What was 
needed, in his opinion, was not an examination for admission, but 
an examination for discharge from attendance upon the continu- 
ation school, in order to obtain proof as to the amount of knowledge 
acquired. The defects of the elementary school, he held, were due 
in many cases to external conditions. “One of the chief defects of 
the elementary school,” he concluded, “is to be found in the effort 
to teach too many things, whereby it becomes impossible to concen- 
trate the instruction. We grant that the children should learn some- 
thing about the colonies. But if teachers are to give instruction 
about school hygiene, social politics, political economy, automobile
-P-A-G-E-477
  
  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 465 
affairs, and other things, the work of the teacher loses itself: in 
details, and its educative character is lost.” 
Kesternicu (of the Center party) protested against the degrada- 
tion of the elementary school into a preparatory school in a general 
system of obligatory continuation school instruction. Himself a 
teacher, he did not look upon examination as a reliable test of the 
work of the elementary school. The examination for admission to 
the continuation school, he held, should always be in the hands of 
teachers of the elementary school. “The layman is inclined to form 
an unjust judgment. He does not know how to think with the 
child; many of them forget that the knowledge they gained at school 
has been deepened by the experience of life; if they could see them- 
selves again in the intellectual poverty of their childhood, they would 
feel inclined to revise their unfavorable judgment of the elementary 
school.” Moreover, the influence of apprenticeship, under which the 
majority of the boys come, should not be overlooked; therefore the 
examination for admission should, in justice, be preceded by a review 
course extending over several months, as was the case even with 
lawyers, before they entered the state examination. “How can we 
expect the graduate of the elementary school,” he added, “ who de- 
liberately forgets everything that reminds him of the work of the 
school, to be ready on the spur of the moment to serve as a test for 
the efficiency of the elementary school? ” 
After asserting that the school satisfactorily accomplishes its chief 
duty, that of providing good instruction in reading, writing, and 
arithmetic, he admitted that there were also some defects. “Among 
these,” he continued, “is the excessive attention given to realistic 
studies and to exercises in gymnastics and drawing at the expense of 
the three principal branches. I would therefore request the minister 
of public instruction to limit, at least to a minimum, the instruction 
in geography, history, nature study, gymnastics, and drawing.” 
Another obstacle to effective work he found in the hobbies with ref- 
erence to methods, and requested the minister to consider, in the 
appointment of district inspectors, primarily the teachers of normal 
schools and not to confine himself to philologists (nie 
graduates). 
RzesnirzeK (of the Free Conservative party), after comments : 
Prussia’s interest in the development of the elementary school and it: 
extensions, advocated further regulation of salaries and appoint- 
ments; the requirement of university preparation for teachers i 
normal institutions and the establishment of scientific extensio: 
courses for those already appointed; provision for assistance in thi 
support of the elementary school on the part of the State in case of 
9228—rp 1909—voLt 1——30 |
-P-A-G-E-478
  466 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
need; statutory regulation of the size of classes, of the appointment 
of new teachers, and of the equipment of new class rooms. He closed 
with words of approval of the efforts of the minister of instruction 
to meet the dearth of teachers, and with the request to obviate changes 
of teachers by uniformity in salaries and by doing away with the 
vacation periods in connection with such changes. 
Docror Hotz, the minister of public instruction, expressed him- 
self in favor of opportunities for promotion on the part of teachers 
of the elementary schools in addition to their prospect of advance- 
ment to positions in normal schools, and promised, amid great ap- 
plause, their consideration as candidates for the district inspectorship 
(i. e@., county superintendency). He admitted the desirability of 
regulating the salaries of teachers in preparatory schools and normal 
schools, so as to induce them to retain their positions, and promised 
consideration of this matter. He announced the early promulgation 
of regulations for principals, granting teachers all possible freedom 
in their work, and closed with the following words: 
It is constantly asserted, and justly so, that the condition of the teachers 
needs improvement and that all school questions are essentially teachers’ ques- 
tions. The work of the teachers determines the character of the work of the 
entire system of public instruction. I would, however, emphasize in this con- 
nection that the Prussian teachers of the lower schools have fully met every 
expectation of the school administration and that the teachers are to be credited 
with all that our schools haye achieved. 
Excxuorr (of the Liberal People’s party), approving the position 
of the minister, directed attention to the need of improvement of the 
inner organization of the people’s schools, whose course of study, he 
claimed, must be modernized. He did not believe that other countries, 
e. g., France, had overtaken Prussia, but he agreed with Representa- 
tive Schiffer in his demands for more object teaching, pointing to 
America as a possible model or example. He concluded: 
Our fatherland is developing into an industrial country. Upon our world 
commerce rests the entire economic development of the country; the sons of 
our people in the lower, as well as in the higher strata, must be equipped with 
the means which will enable them to meet the competition that will decide the 
future of the nation. Therefore the methods of instruction must be reformed 
and adjusted to the change in economic conditions. 
Ernst (of the Liberal Union party) emphasized the view that the 
defects of the elementary school were due, not to lack of diligence on 
the part of teachers, but to external conditions already enumerated. 
He criticised also the bureaucratic tendencies of some school in- 
spectors, leading to the assumption “ that in some parts of the coun- 
try the center of gravity in the school lies no longer in the personality 
of the teacher, but in the office of the supervisor.” His chief stress 
was upon the need of a revision of the course of study with a view to
-P-A-G-E-479
    
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 467 
relieving the elementary school of burdens, especially in the lower 
grades. He said: 
It is to be regretted that the ideas of Frébel are so little followed among 
us. * * * The school can only proceed on the basis of what the child brings 
to it. Now, unfortunately, a great number of families lack the time, possibly 
also the desire, to occupy themselves with their children under school age. The 
child goes astray or remains stagnant in development; upon the State rests 
the responsibility of doing much more than it is doing. 
After further complimenting the minister of instruction upon his 
attitude, he added a criticism of the despotic methods of some super- 
visors in examinations of children, and amid great applause expressed 
the hope that the labors of the house committee would lead to the 
establishment of a commission of reform for the lower schools. 
Docror Hacxensere (of the National Liberal party) was not fully 
in accord with the critical remarks of his party colleague Schiffer, 
nor with the speakers who followed him. The purpose of the reso- 
lution, he held, was not definitely to criticise possible defects of the 
elementary school, but to ask for full information on the subject, and 
to assure the minister of the fullest sympathy in his efforts to obtai 
relief. He rejoiced in the promise of the minister to exert himsel 
in the removal of external obstacles, but regretted that he had not 
expressed himself as to the general need of changes in the course o 
study and in the entire management of the schools, now ne 
by statutes of more than thirty years’ standing. 
We are far from asking again and again for new experiments for the lower 
schools, and it may be possible to pass over certain defects in the regulation 
and courses of study, since ultimately the essential is not the written statute, 
but the personalities of the teachers and of the supervising officials. 
He did not go into details except on one point, as follows: 
  It is possible also to economize energy, especially in small schools of one 
room. Too much is prescribed in the course of study for the children and fo: 
the teacher in the lower grades. The necessary consequence must be tha 
these youngest pupils, who need constant supervision and guidance, are traine 
in indolence, carelessness, and slipshod ways, because the teacher is absolutel: 
unable to give them the necessary attention. 
He rejected the suspicion that the movers of the resolution cel 
templated the overburdening of the school with matter of pe 
Overburdening does not depend on the number of subjects of in- 
struction; to obviate it, reliance should be placed on the skill of thi 
inspectors in giving directions, and, above all, on the freedom allow: 
the teacher in the selection of details. 
With reference to the criticism of the scanty equipment of the 
people’s school on the part of his party colleague, Schiffer, he in- 
ferred that the latter had taken his illustrations from sections of 
the country which were far in arrear in these matters; he himself,  
-P-A-G-E-480
  
468 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
interested for thirty years in schools, had found no instances that 
bore out these strictures. He summed up: 
The liveliest interest for the elementary school, for its work and its success, 
induces me to put this motion, and induces the house, as I rejoice to say again, 
to concur in its principle. I have not the least doubt that the representatives 
of the minister will furnish us, from the experiences in the several provinces 
with their varying school organizations, sufficient material to enable us to 
examine what defects exist; if we should find here or there some things good 
which elsewhere are defective, we shall heartily rejoice; but if we find things 
that call for improvement we shall, as far as possible, enact the needed meas- 
ures; for what we do for our Volksschule we do for our people and for its 
future welfare. 
Hecxenroru (of the Conservative party) expressed sympathy with 
the motion in the name of the Conservatives, and also the hope that 
the committee submit definite proposals. After reviewing in some 
detail the external and internal difficulties mentioned by the minister, 
he recommended especially, “in order to secure better cooperation 
on the part of the family, the emphatic support of kindergartens by 
the State, and criticizes the tendency of school inspectors to inter- 
fere excessively with the management of the schools.” He, too, prom- 
ised the support of his party in all that concerned the improvement 
of the elementary schools. 
The motion was then referred to the committee on public 
instruction. 
GYMNASTICS IN GERMAN SCHOOLS. 
Physical exercises in German lower schools, which used to have a 
regular place on the daily time table, seem to be in danger of extinc- 
tion, since women teachers gradually increase in number, and men 
are lured away from the profession of teaching into channels of com- 
merce, industry, agriculture, and mining, into the learned professions 
and technological pursuits, in all of which better incomes are offered 
than in the service of education. The “ Statistik des deutschen 
Schulturnens ” reports: 
Of the 30,000 people’s schools of Prussia, already 400 have no gymnastics for 
girls at all, owing to the lack of men teachers, and in many others the branch, 
physical exercises, is slighted. Conforming to the course of study decreed by 
Minister Falk in 1872, physical exercises on apparatus (horizontal bar, parallel 
bars, ladder, rope, horse, springboard, etc.), either in gymnastic halls built for 
the purpose or in the open air, were for several decades as regularly conducted 
as exercises in arithmetic, but the statistics of 1904 show that of the 30,000 
schools only 1,800, or 6 per cent, have kept up this practice faithfully; 94 per 
cent have begun to slight gymnastics more or less, either in the lower grades or 
in all the grades. 
Since 1904, when that report went through the press, the state, 
provincial, and city school authorities have awakened to the necessity 
 
-P-A-G-E-481
    
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 469 
of doing something to counteract physical degeneration. New regu- 
lations and rigorous supervision have put new life into this branch of 
the curriculum, but since the true cause, lack of male teachers, is 
operative in an ever-increasing degree, it is expected that gymnastics 
will go down, as they have had a tendency to do in every country 
where women teachers predominate. 
In the Prussian Diet the danger was discussed recently and the 
gradual disappearance of gymnastics in rural schools was lamented, 
though some members indicated that the pupils of rural schools per- 
haps needed gymnastics less than city children, since the former 
enjoyed fresh air, had more exercise in walking, and a good deal of 
muscular exercise in working in gardens, dairies, and in the fields 
and woods. It is the city children who lose the great benefit of mus- 
cular exertion, unless the recent movement in behalf of playgrounds 
can counteract the loss indicated. 
Several ministers of education in Germany have recently — 
that women teachers undergo regular instruction in gymnastics, an 
pass an examination to enable them to train their girl pupils properly 
indoors and outdoors. 
COEDUCATION IN THE PULIC SCHOOLS OF PRUSSIA. 
  While in the German press the idea of coeducation of the sexes 
seems to gain ground, and while in secondary schools and in higher 
institutions women students are admitted, the practice loses ground 
in the lower schools. The number of classes or schoolrooms increase 
rapidly, even in small towns and villages, which reduces the re 
of pupils to the teacher, but the separation of the sexes increases. Ii 
1886 there were in Prussia 4,838,247 children in elementary schools; 
of these three-fourths were taught in mixed classes. Twenty years 
later, in 1906, the number of coeducational classes was only two- 
thirds of the whole number; that is to say, the number of classes in 
rural and other small school districts in which the sexes were sep- 
arated has risen from 4,206 in 1886 to 9,180 in 1906. Coeducation 
classes are found chiefly in small towns where grading is difficult, 
and in rural districts which maintain ungraded schools. 
—p 
CHILDREN’S MEMORY AND THEIR CAPACITY TO LEARN. 
Since time immemorial the view has been entertained that in chil 
hood the capacity to learn new things, and to keep in memory things 
learned, is strongest. This opinion, though not materially a 
needs a slight modification, as Professor Groos, of the Giessen Un: 
 
-P-A-G-E-482
  470 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
versity, attempts to prove in his new work, The Soul Life of the 
Child (Das Seelenleben des Kindes). We can, according to Ebbing- 
haus, compare by means of tests the learning capacity of several 
persons, by determining the number of repetitions necessary for each 
to memorize a line of syllables strung together without expressing 
sense. Six of such syllables are memorized at once; 10 such syllables 
require from 3 to 7 repetitions, 12 need 14 to 16 repetitions, and 16 
syllables require on an average no less than 30 repetitions. : 
It has been proved, however, that in the child the capacity to learn 
is as yet very little developed; that an increase in this capacity does 
not begin until the tenth year of age; that during the time of adoles- 
» cence an interruption in the process of mental development takes 
place, which is followed up to the twenty-fifth year of life by a nota- 
ble acceleration. It is true, as Groos emphasizes, that such tests are 
to be viewed with great caution, since the child in learning such sylla- 
bles, senselessly strung together, feels no interest, while the child of 
more advanced years takes an interest in the test itself and is thereby 
aided in memorizing. 
It is well known that children can memorize in an astonishingly 
brief time verses (jingle-rhymes, for instance) which please them; 
that is, either verses which convey ideas to them apperceived by ideas 
previously acquired or verses which appeal to their esthetic sense 
through smooth rhyme and melody. The capacity to retain—that is, 
the memory—may be tested experimentally by having the memorized 
matter recited at regular intervals, counting the number of repeti- 
tions required for the purpose and comparing it with the number 
needed when first learned. By so doing it has been proved that the 
child’s memory has the advantage over that of the half-grown and 
the adult person. According to Wessely’s investigations, the average 
memory of pupils of senior grades and of colleges in memorizing 
poems anew was somewhat weaker than that of younger students, 
say of middle grades, and much weaker than that of children. Latin 
words, according to other systematic tests, were best learned by 
pupils at the age of 12. Experience, as well as systematic tests, have 
shown, however, that facts, especially such as can be acquired through 
reasoning, being the final expression of cause and effect, are learned 
by older students without appeal to the memory. 
All of this goes to prove that adults surpass the child in learning 
when interest, will power, and apperceptive material aid them, but 
that the capacity to acquire mechanically and retain that which is 
thus learned is far greater in childhood than in advanced years. 
This result of systematic tests is quite in accord with the experience of 
daily life, and simply confirms an old truth. But it does more; it 
suggests to the teacher that it is quite in accord with nature’s processes 
to allow children below 10 years of age to acquire knowledge by
-P-A-G-E-483
  
  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 471 
means of mechanical memorizing, and that it is futile to appeal much 
to the understanding in the primary grades; furthermore, that as 
the pupils grow in years appeals to matters previously learned are 
increasingly useful, and that the practice of mechanical memory drill 
should gradually give way to a method which builds upon previous 
cognitions, guides the pupils from cause to effect, or vice versa, and 
enlists the individual interest and will power of the pupils. 
To German teachers these conclusions teach the lesson that the 
Socratic, or oral, method, which has been exclusively practiced in that 
country for centuries, is not preferable in childhood, but that its 
proper place is during the age from 10 to 14 and later. Students of 
high-school and college age should rely little on mechanical memory 
drill and more on argumentative acquisition and on self-active dis- 
covery of knowledge. Of course there is no hard and fast rule con- 
cerning methods of teaching; each teacher must find the way best 
suited to the age and individuality of her pupil. It is pleasing: to 
Americans, though, to notice that late psychological investigators 
intimate that our method of early mechanical drill, so frequently 
criticised, is the right one for childhood, though inappropriate for 
later years. 
EXAMINATION OF WOMEN SCHOOL PRINCIPALS IN PRUSSIA. 
All teachers of elementary schools in Prussia, as well as in most 
other German States, men and women, have to undergo an exami- 
nation for principalship if they aspire to such a position, while the 
graduation diploma of a normal school qualifies them to accept a 
position as class teacher. This examination (called Oberlehrer- or 
Oberlehrerinnen-Examen) is so arranged as to permit each candi- 
date to select two approved branches in which he or she is to be 
examined. Since all candidates are normal-school graduates and 
have been teaching for a number of years, the other branches are 
omitted. The selection of branches is therefore significant, for it 
plainly indicates the preferences and talents of the examinees. 
During the last thirteen years—that is, since 1895, when women 
were first admitted to the examination for principalship—only 473 
examinees have passed, or 1.92 per cent of the total number of women 
teachers, while of the men 5.65 per cent have passed. The most | 
interesting feature of these examinations is the selection of branches 
on the part of the women, showing that they prefer the forms of 
knowledge, while men prefer the substance, as will be seen from the 
following figures: 
Of the 473 women who passed, 270 had selected German, 176 his- 
tory, 152 English, 144 French, and 85 religion; but only 62 had 
selected mathematics, 21 geography, 18 botany and zoology, and 13

physics and chemistry. The following partial list goes more into

Other possible combinations occurred only in a few cases. Mathe- 
matics and natural science, for instance, were chosen only by 7. 
Hence it is plain that women evince interest and talent chiefly in 
the humanities, a fact which the authorities will bear in mind in 
planning the girls’ secondary schools. 
The men’s preferences in choosing branches to be examined in 
lean toward mathematics, natural history, biology, natural science; 
in’ short, branches which deal more with what the Germans call 
‘“Realien,” i. e., real knowledge in contradistinction to forms of 
knowledge. 
EDUCATION OF WEAK-MINDED CHILDREN IN GERMANY. 
Mrs. Franz Weigl reports in Soziale Kultur that 73 cities of Ger- 
many have established auxiliary schools for weak-minded children. 
An inquiry into the subsequent life of most of the pupils of these 
schools revealed the following results:

  These results are surprisingly gratifying. In 48 of the 78 cities 
between 50 and 100 per cent of all the children in special schools 
turned out to be self-supporting after leaving school, and many of 
the others were not entirely helpless, but could earn enough and were 
intelligent enough to lead useful lives. These results are the more
-P-A-G-E-485
  
  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 473 
gratifying when compared with Doctor Stelzner’s report, who in- 
vestigated the lives of 200 weak-minded persons who had not received 
instruction in auxiliary schools for backward children. She found 
that of that number 44 had been convicted as hopeless tramps, 19 
for begging, 146 for larceny, 10 for housebreaking, 3 for forging, 
8 for fraud, and 5 for assault. The sum of convictions being 235, 
shows that some of these unfortunates had been convicted repeatedly. 
CRIPPLED CHILDREN IN GERMANY.* 
The statistical bureau of the Grand Duchy of Baden published 
recently the results of an inquiry into the number of deformed chil- 
dren of school age in Baden. There were found 2,763 children 
between 6 and 14 years of age who suffered in consequence of in- 
herited or accidental physical defects or loss of limbs. It was found 
that many of these 2,763 children (among whom were 31 deaf and 
7 blind) were mentally deficient, i. e., one-tenth of them were nearly 
or wholly idiotic. It was found also that among each 1,000 inhab- 
itants 1.4 were seriously or only slightly deformed, and this is pre- 
cisely the same proportion that was found in the entire Empire of 
Germany in 1905. That there should be more crippled boys (57.3 
per cent) than crippled girls (42.7 per cent) needs no explanation. 
Of the 2,763 children enumerated in Baden, 2,372 attended elemen- 
tary schools, 141 secondary schools, 43 schools for the feeble-minded, 
and 18 were taught by private teachers. In 2,583 cases the parents 
themselves, in 79 cases the poor-relief fund supported the children, 
in 92 cases small aid was rendered the parents, in 101 cases the chil- 
dren were supported by relatives. In 791 cases successful operations 
had been performed, 633 operations had ameliorated the condition 
of the children somewhat, while in 573 cases attempts. to cure the 
deformities had proved unsuccessful. 
CARE OF DEPENDENT CHILDREN IN PRUSSIA. 
The last Prussian report on “ Fiirsorge-Erziehung” (1906) states 
the results of four years. Since 1901, when a law was passed con- - 
cerning the education of children who require special care, being 
either criminally inclined or subject to criminal influences through 
their environments, the increase of such children has kept pace with 
the increase of the population. The number of such children was 
6,523 (4,859 boys and 2,164 girls) in 1908; 6,458 (4,803 boys and   
«For further information on this subject, see Chapter XI of this report— Schools for 
Crippled Children Abroad.”

  /AT4 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
2,155 girls) in 1904; 6,636 (4,375 boys and 2,261 girls) in 1905; 
6,923 (4,591 boys and 2,322 girls) in 1906. 
Concerning their ages the report says: “ Two and seven-tenths per 
cent were less than 6 years old; 29.5 per cent were between 6 and 12; 
67.8 per cent were between 12 and 18.” Sixteen per cent of all these 
children in 1906 were illegitimate, a considerable decrease since 1904. 
On the other hand, the number, of families of which father or 
mother, or both, had been convicted of crime had slightly in- 
creased. The number of such neglected, though not always depraved, 
children is proportionately greater by far in large cities than in small 
communities. 
There were in communities of less than 2,000 inhabitants, 1,226 
such children; of between 2,000 and 20,000 inhabitants, 1,614; of 
between 20,000 and 100,000 inhabitants, 1,474; of over 100,000 inhabi- 
tants, excluding Berlin, 1,808; Berlin alone contributed 801; making 
a total of 6,923. 
In Prussia, as well as in other States of the German Empire, such 
children are assigned by the juvenile courts to private families, the 
heads of which report to the probation officers, or directly to the 
court, at stated intervals, how the children are progressing, and the 
children’s school-term reports must be shown. There is now a perfect 
system of juvenile courts in German cities, a recent law having desig- 
nated the probate courts of each judicial district to act in cases of 
juvenile criminality and in cases of neglect. These courts were 
selected in 1907 to act as juvenile courts, because the judges of such 
courts have heretofore dealt with the care of orphans. 
It was the city of Frankfort on the Main which, following the 
example of some cities in the United States, appointed separate 
judges for juvenile criminality. The Prussian legislature took the 
matter up and passed the law which added the functions of juvenile 
courts to those of the probate courts in the kingdom. While it may 
be supposed that some of these judges are not ideal judges of chil- 
dren’s peccadillos, it is reasonable, on the other hand, to think that 
there will be many men among them quite fit for the office, since their 
former duties included the care of orphans. 
FEEDING SCHOOL CHILDREN IN BAVARIA. 
Miss. Eugenie Abresch gives am account, (in Die Lehrérin, No. 50, 
vol. 24) of the efforts made in Bavaria (south Germany) in feeding 
children so as to secure the greatest regularity and punctuality. An 
inquiry set on foot in 18 cities of the Kingdom revealed the fact that 
in 12 of them regular meals are provided, in the other 6 sporadic 
efforts are made whenever necessity demands them. In none of the
-P-A-G-E-487
  
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 475 
12 cities is it charity only which suggests the measures, but peda- 
gogical considerations also prompt them. In 3 cities, Ludwigshafen, 
Landau, and Zweibriicken, to which may be added Nuremberg, break- 
fast is offered. In 10 cities breakfast and a midday meal, luncheon 
as we would call it, are served, namely, in Munich, Nuremberg, Wiirz- 
burg, Bamberg, Tutzing, Passau, Bayreuth, Pirmasens, Kaiserslau- 
tern, and Neustadt. In Ludwigshafen alone breakfast and a liberal 
dinner are served. 
In Ludwigshafen indigent children are given, before school opens, 
a quarter liter of warm milk (not skimmed) and two rolls. During 
the winter of 1906-7 as many as 1,230 children, or about 10 per cent 
of all the children attending the lower schools, received breakfast, 
which cost the city $1,420. The milk supply is controlled by the 
health authorities. In connection with Ludwigshafen, Mannheim 
should be mentioned, situated on the opposite bank of the Rhine. 
This city in the Grand Duchy of Baden paid $5,121 during the same 
year for milk and rolls given to 15 per cent of its school children. 
The school authorities of the Bavarian town of Zweibriicken paid 
as much for breakfast given to 10 per cent of its school children, but 
they did so only during four winter months. Nuremberg gave break- 
fast only in extreme cases of poverty. 
The cities whose school authorities gave warm luncheon number 9, 
4 of which derive the means for this from private endowments. These 
9 cities vary in the proportion of children participating in the meals 
between 1 per cent and 5.5 per cent, the difference resulting not so 
much from the greater or less degree of poverty found as from 
the degree of sympathy of teachers and school officers. These mid- 
day meals are more or less substantial; all include nourishing soup 
with bread, some kind of meat with vegetables, and some kind of 
pudding (Mehlspeise). Since every meal is presided over by the lady 
teachers, the children can be taught table manners. 
Mothers who can not afford to leave their workshops in the middle 
of the day to prepare their children’s dinner make arrangements with 
the teachers to let their children take part in the school dinners. 
Hence the ones around the hospitable board in the gymnasium hall 
of the school rarely know who are charity guests and who are not. 
All are served alike, all learn nice table manners, and practice clean- 
liness and good companionship. 
THE WORK OF SCHOOL PHYSICIANS. 
The variety of duties of the school physician is illustrated inter- 
estingly in the last annual report of that official in the city of Mann- 
heim. Aside from general hygiene of school and home, the report 
deals with the individual conditions of the pupils whom the physi-
-P-A-G-E-488
476 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
cian examined, a labor in which he was aided by the teachers. In 
order to enlist the latter’s sympathy and create comprehension of 
hygienic requirements he delivered before them a series of systemat- 
ically arranged lectures. During regular office hours, which were 
long and frequent, he examined not only young candidates for vaca- 
tion colonies, but other children whom the teachers considered sub- 
jects of especial care, namely, 843 boys and 1,514 girls. 
Among the boys were found 140, among the girls 280, who needed 
attention, chiefly owing to impaired eyesight, and explanatory letters 
were sent to the parents. Of the 140 boys, 59 per cent were placed 
under physicians’ care; of the 280 girls, 62 per cent. For vacation 
colonies and salt-water baths nearly 12 per cent of all the school 
children over 10 years of age applied, but only 24 per cent of the 
applicants could be accommodated, owing to the limited means at the 
disposal of the authorities. The selection was made according to the 
physical necessities of the different cases, as well as to the social con- 
ditions and environment of the children; 308 were selected, of whom. - 
only 19 slept alone at home. 
Children recommended by their teachers for admission to auxiliary 
schools or classes for the weak-minded were all examined by the 
school physician. Among these pupils were found 39 per cent of 
boys and 40 per cent of girls who were hard of hearing. In classes 
for the normally endowed there were still 17.3 per cent of boys and 
18.8 per cent of girls with somewhat defective hearing. A complete 
record of the physical and mental condition of each male pupil gradu- 
ating from the auxiliary schools was prepared and handed over to the 
civil authorities for the future use of the army recruiting officers. 
Likewise a record was prepared in each case where the juvenile court 
decreed that a child be taken into especial care, criminal propensities 
or evil influences in the child’s environment having been proved. 
As a result of former dental examinations and in accordance with 
the experience of Strassburg, Frankfort, and other places, a regular 
dental clinic was established. Every child ready to enter school at 
6 years of age was physically examined, and 5.5 per cent of them all 
were denied admittance owing to lack of sufficient physical or mental 
development. All these examinations required time and great care, 
but they were eminently beneficial for the entire school system. 
Former measurements of height and weight of pupils were con- 
tinued, so as to complete the records kept. It was found that the 
average height of the pupils had slightly decreased, while the aver- 
age weight showed no material change. Curvature of the spine was 
found in 264 boys and 252 girls, and among these were 226 boys and 
189 girls who had suffered from rickets in early youth. The report 
contains other items of interest, but the foregoing may suffice to
-P-A-G-E-489
    
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 477 
prove how beneficial the introduction of medical inspection is to all 
concerned. 
A consular report from Frankfort gives the following brief ac- 
count of a step in advance by the city council of Erlangen: 
The common council of Erlangen made an arrangement with the management 
of the medical clinic of the university that it should, for the present, assume 
the functions of school physician. All the pupils of the public schools undergo 
medical examination, except where a certificate of the family physician is 
produced. The parents or guardians are at once notified of the result of the 
examination, so that they may place their children under medical treatment if 
necessary. The school physicians themselves are not to treat them. For every 
pupil a health record is kept, which is filled out regularly during the entire 
course of tuition. In every school a weekly consultation takes place, at which 
pupils who are suffering from maladies or physical disturbances of any kind 
are required to be present. With the management of the university eye and 
ear clinic similar arrangements are made. 
An important feature of all German school hygiene institutions 
is the keeping of regular records, which are continued throughout 
the course as methodically as are the term records of progress in the 
branches of study and of the students’ deportment. 
’ 
TAKING CARE OF CHILDREN’S TEETH IN SCHOOL. 
The city of Strassburg is the pioneer in taking care of children’s 
teeth during school age and teaching the children how to preserve 
their teeth. In six years as many as 27,801 children were treated by 
school dentists of that city. The following figures show the extent 
of the service rendered and the costs:

The expenses of the dental service in Strassburg, as is obvious, 
amounted to so little that the introduction of regular dental service 
in schools can not be opposed on that account. For the year 1908 
the city school authorities appropriated $2,380 (10,000 marks), which 
is a little less than 25 cents for each registered pupil. 
In the city of Darmstadt an investigation proved that only one in 
every hundred children had faultless teeth. It was estimated in

Frankfort on the Main that an expenditure of $7,500 annually would 
provide ample clinical aid, including treatment of the teeth of all the 
children attending the public schools of that city. In Freiburg, 
Baden, up to the end of 1907, on thirty-seven different days in which 
dental examinations were made, 2,478 children were.treated. The 
number of extractions was 3,689; fillings, 1,231; new teeth put in, 102; 
and roots treated, 65. The number of extractions must gradually de- 
crease and the fillings increase before the real object of this dental 
clinic will have been attained. Of the children examined only 2 in 
every 1,000 had ever before been treated by a dentist. 
YEARS OF SERVICE AND AGES OF ANNUITANTS IN GERMANY. 
The Pidagogische Zeitung of Berlin .(No. 3 of 1909) gives a 
review of the length of service and the ages of German teachers 
granted pensions, or dying during service. The statements are given 
for periods of ten years. For the last ten fiscal years the following 
averages are stated:

THE AGES OF PRUSSIAN TEACHERS. 
Governmental statistics for 1908 state the ages of teachers in ele- 
mentary or common schools in Prussia to be as follows:

     The per cent column does not give a total of 100, owing to the 
fact that some teachers of primary grades (about 0.24 per cent) are 
less than 20 years of age. 
ILLITERACY IN EUROPE. 
The third edition of the Handworterbuch fiir Staatswissenschaften 
(1908) gives a statistical review of illiteracy in European countries. 
In every country (except in Great Britain and Ireland, where ina- 
bility to sign the marriage register is taken as the measure of illiter- 
acy), illiterates are counted among the army and navy recruits. The 
following facts are stated:

the five years from 1881 to 1885, 362 men and 699 women illiterate; 
in the period 1892-1896 the number of men had decreased to 180, 
that of the women to 213; in the period 1901-1905 the numbers were 
45 men and 73 women. 
ILLITERACY AND INVENTIVENESS. 
Professor Du Bois-Reymond, of Berlin, in his work on Inventions 
and Inventors, attempts to prove that inventive productivity in dif- 
ferent countries depends upon social factors. Inventive productiv- 
ity is, he claims, not a spontaneous expression of life, but is influ- 
enced to a very large degree by suggestions from without, especially 
by the environment. General education, density of population, 
transportation facilities, social organization, etc., determine this pro- 
ductivity, and hence it is explained that despite the participation of 
the working people in state affairs comparatively few patent appli- 
cations come from laboring men. The following table is the result 
of an inquiry made in 1900:

« Of white population over 10 years of age (census of 1900). 
One glance at the foregoing figures shows that race characteristics 
do not predetermine the inventive productivity of a country, nor 
does the high proportion of literates, but social factors, especially 
the high status of industry, do determine it. England, the United 
States, and Germany, the countries having the best developed sys- 
tems of industry, are the most productive in inventions. Germany 
alone had, in 1900, 1,500 patent applications concerning technical 
contrivances relating to electricity. 
THE EDUCATIONAL SITUATION IN HUNGARY. 
In Hungary differences arising from friction between nationalities 
and from denominational religious friction retard the schools in 
their beneficent work. It is doubtless the case that these chaotic 
educational conditions in Hungary are the cause of the high per cent
-P-A-G-E-493
  
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 481 
of illiteracy found in that country. Hiibner’s Geographic Statis- 
tical Tables credit Hungary with 476 illiterates to every 1,000 in- 
habitants, according to the census of 1900, and with 149 illiterates to 
every 1,000 recruits. 
The following facts and historical allusions are taken from Allge- 
meine Deutsche Lehrerzeitung, Leipzig: 
An unprejudiced observer must admit that the Hungarian (or 
Magyaric) element in Transleithania (Hungary) has no easy posi- 
tion. According to the census of 1900, Hungary had 8,742,301 Hun- 
garians or Magyars; 2,799,479 Roumanians; 2,135,181 Germans; 
2,018,641 Slavonians; 1,678,569 Croatians; 1,052,180 Servians; 429,- 
447 Ruthenians, and 397,761 other elements; hence 8,742,301 Hun- 
garians against 10,512,258 representatives of other nationalities. It 
would be folly to speak of Hungarian hegemony if each of the other 
elements formed a compact nationality or a state within a state. 
The independent political existence of Hungary dates from the 
year 1867, when Cisleithania, the Austrian crown lands, were sepa- 
rated from Hungary to form a separate union, connected with Hun- 
gary only through the person of the Emperor, who is both Emperor 
of Austria and King of Hungary. After the independence of Hun- 
gary was constitutionally guaranteed, the Government aimed at 
making the people homogeneous, a difficult matter, since the to a 
certain degree antagonistic elements live in groups, one portion of 
the Kingdom being predominatingly Roumanian, another Servian, 
or Croatian, or Magyaric, or German, as the case may be. Nowhere 
were the Government’s efforts at welding the population more suc- 
cessful than in southern Hungary, inhabited chiefly by Germans 
(Suabians). This part of the monarchy is called, not improperly, 
the “ Hungarian Canaan,” the promised land. The city of Temesvar, 
which used to be an exclusively German town, and still is inhabited 
chiefly by Germans, permitted its German theater to be closed for 
want of support. Communities which had but a small Magyaric 
representation in their councils allowed their German schools to be 
changed to Magyaric schools, without even being urged to do so by 
the Government. 
But the situation has changed radically in recent years among the 
Germans, as well as among all the other nationalities, in southern 
and western Hungary. The national aspirations of the Poles, Bo- 
hemians, Italians, and other competent races of the Austrian Empire, 
have been copied by the various national fragments in Transleithania. 
The propaganda in favor of retaining their several languages, 
customs, etc., has had a surprising success. Schools which had been 
Magyarized are being changed by again employing teachers who use 
the mother tongue in school. Many parents prohibit the use of the 
9228—xp 1909—vor 1——31
-P-A-G-E-494
  482 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
Hungarian language at home and on the playground. German 
theaters are opened. The village and city councils are using German, 
Roumanian, or other mother tongues as mediums of intercourse. 
Casinos, reading circles, agricultural societies, library clubs, and other 
gatherings are being organized, from which Hungarian periodicals 
and books are banished. Singing societies are called into life, in 
which never a Magyaric song or composition is heard. 
Ever since the Poles in Galicia (Austria) and the Czechs in 
Bohemia and Moravia (Austria) succeeded in securing for themselves 
local autonomy, the Roumanians,: Servians, Germans, Croatians, 
Slavonians, and other nationalities in Hungary are imbued with the 
idea of preserving their national individualities, and it is difficult to 
foresee where the ,chaotic condition will end, or what will be the 
upshot of it for the Empire. 
The Hungarian state educational system was regulated, as was that 
of all Austrian crown lands, up to 1848, by a law promulgated by 
Emperor-King Francis in 1805. This law was called “ Ratio Educa- 
tionis,” the principles of which are still in force. At present there 
are five laws concerning the lower public schools: (1) The law of 
1868, which deals with the internal management of the schools; 
(2) the law of 1876, which regulates the election of local school au- 
thorities; (3) the law of 1893, which determines the teachers’ salaries 
of both communal and denominational schools; (4) the law of 1897, 
which deals with the state’s participation in school expenditures, 
especially salaries; and (5) the law of 1908, which decrees the abol- 
ishment of tuition fees for elementary schools. 
In 1907 the Hungarian legislature discussed an amendment to the 
law of 1897, which subsequently passed, dealing with the state’s par- 
ticipation in school expenditures; but the bill nearly failed to pass, 
owing to the antipathy of the non-Magyaric nationalities, who op- 
posed it, fearing that the Magyars would suppress their languages. 
The Hungarians emphatically state that it is not their object to sup- 
press the various mother tongues of the other nationalities, but that 
they must insist that to the Magyaric language, as the official language 
of the country, a certain number of hours a day be devoted in every 
school, since in non-Magyaric communities the official language is 
frequently neglected. All the Hungarian Government wants is a 
proper representation of the national language in the curriculum, 
otherwise the state as such could not be called upon to aid in keeping 
the schools open. 
Another cause for opposing the school legislation of the Govern- 
ment lies in the fact that the various religious denominations and 
their clergy suspect the Government of trying to injure them through 
the influence exerted upon the school children by state-subsidized 
teachers.
-P-A-G-E-495
  
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 483 
All these currents and counter currents the present minister of 
public instruction, Count Apponyi, has led into one channel by his 
success in having the law so interpreted that every school for which 
a community claims a state subsidy or grant must devote a part of 
the day to the study of Hungarian, the official language, while the 
mother tongue, or local language of the district, may be used for all 
the rest of the day. 
Whether the Government’s hope to supplant the languages of other 
nationalities will be realized does not, as experience in other countries 
las demonstrated, depend upon any money spent or withheld by the 
state, nor upon the greater or lower degree of local patriotism, but 
simply and solely upon the ease with which the one or the other 
language can be learned and spoken. The Saxon farmers in Sieben- 
biirgen (in southeastern Hungary) have for over seven hundred 
years maintained their mother tongue, a German dialect, after having 
stripped it of all troublesome inflections and grammatical difficulties, 
as the Anglo-Saxons did with the language they took with them into 
Great Britain. The ease with which the English language can be 
used secured it the victory over Celtic, Latin, and Norman-French. 
Though it has absorbed innumerable words of Latin, French, and 
Greek origin, its structure is still Anglo-Saxon, and the uneducated 
use words of Anglo-Saxon origin almost exclusively. A similar vic- 
tory was won in Siebenbiirgen. Magyaric, on the other hand, is a 
language resembling the Latin in its rigidity of grammatical inflection 
and construction. Its difficult grammar will probably be its own 
bitterest enemy, not the clergy of this or that church, nor the local 
patriotism of the communities of Roumanian, Servian, German, 
Slavonian, Croatian, or Ruthenian extraction. Man is apt to use the 
tool that is handiest for use and most practicable for the work in 
hand, and likewise the language which requires least exertion in 
learning and using will win in the linguistic race in Hungary, as 
everywhere else. 
ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS IN BUDAPEST. 
The Hungarian ministry of education published recently a report 
of the statistical and historical development of the elementary school 
system of the capital of Hungary, which dealt with the period from 
1871 to 1900, inclusive. The document was prepared by the noted 
Hungarian educator, Joseph von Kérésis, and shows that the favor- 
able economic development of the city during these thirty years is 
paralleled by the development of the schools. In 1871 there were 
for about 10,000 pupils only 32 schoolhouses, with 129 rooms for 146 
 
-P-A-G-E-496
  
  484 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
grades. In most rooms more than 80 pupils were seated, in 4 rooms 
more than 100. Sanitary conditions of the schoolhouses were very 
defective ; also teachers were lacking, for there were only 181 teachers 
for 146 grades or classes. 
The worst feature of the system was the difference between the 
number of pupils enrolled and those in attendance, so that on an 
average every fifth child was obliged to repeat the course of an 
entire year—that is, was not promoted. Almost half of all the pupils 
were absent 1 to 5 per cent of the time; one-fifth, 5 to 10 per cent; 
one-seventh, 10 to 20 per cent; 332 children, 20 to 30 per cent; 96 
children, 30 to 40 per cent; and 82 children, 40 to 50 per cent. These 
absences are explained by the want of consideration of the Hungarian 
school authorities for the non-Magyaric nationalities, with the result 
that 3,645 children of the city of other nationalities, being unable to 
understand the Hungarian language, were kept from school by their 
parents or played truant. (See also p. 480.) 
All these defects of the system have been remedied in the course 
of the years. The following table shows the results of improved 
school administration, and especially of greater tolerance shown to 
the non-Magyaric elements of the population, for rigid exclusive- 
ness would hardly be advantageous to the education of the young 
in a city where, in a population of 703,448, there are 387,276 who 
speak German. The fact that between 35 and 50 per cent of the 
school children are older by one to five years than they should be, 
judged by the grades they are in, is noted in the report. The per 
cent of absence is still 15.

CONFERENCE OF TEACHERS OF CONTINUATION SCHOOLS. 
The German Association of Continuation School Teachers held a 
meeting in Brunswick, October, 1908, which was unusually well at- 
tended. The various state governments of the Empire gave evidence 
of their interest in the proceedings by sending many delegates to 
the meeting to represent them. The proceedings consisted of aca- 
demic discussions, during which it was clearly shown that the princi- 
ples and nomenclature of the system of continuation schools are not 
as yet clearly defined. Doctor Stieda, of the University of Leipzig,
-P-A-G-E-497
  
  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 485 
spoke about the possibility of developing German handicraft, and 
intimated that the great centralizing changes in the economic and 
business life of Germany tended to destroy the small shops; hence, 
that the artisan had to face the possibility of being superseded by 
the factory “hand.” Still, he believed that by equipping the home- 
worker or small shopworker better than heretofore, the skilled la- 
borer could be enabled to cope with modern factory work, by making 
him inventive and encouraging him to evolve new ideas, new forms, 
and new methods. He deprecated the system of shop apprenticeship, 
and would substitute for it, or at least combine with it, school in- 
struction in trade technology. 
The proposition of the speaker was discussed with much anima- 
tion, especially his suggestion that the so-called guild schools might 
be abandoned in favor of government schools. 
Rural continuation schools, in which the technical part of instruc- 
tion consists of agriculture, horticulture, floriculture, pomology, for- 
estry, and stock raising, were discussed in a paper by Mr. Herbst, of 
Calvérde. His resolutions, culminating in an appeal to the people 
for a further extension and improvement of the system of rural con- 
tinuation schools now in existence, were adopted unanimously. 
Also, the trade or industrial school system was discussed with re- 
gard to its better organization. The chief emphasis during the dis- 
cussion was laid upon the necessity of uniform definitions and no- 
menclature of the various schools. It was admitted generally that 
during the first period of existence of the continuation school sys- 
tem, such schools mostly kept open in the evening, and had been 
merely educational “repair shops,” but that during the last two 
decades they had properly assumed the character of vocational 
schools, serving distinct purposes, such as preparing skilled labor for 
shop trades, factories, industrial arts, etc., but especially serving shop 
apprentices, since mathematics and bookkeeping, drawing and sketch- 
ing, geography and history, language and composition, are now taught 
with particular reference to the apprentice’s occupation. 
Privy Councilor Doctor von Seefeld, who represented the Prussian 
minister of commerce and industry, deprecated any minute definition 
and classification of the numerous vocational continuation schools, 
intimating that such uniformity would lead to mechanical drill, while 
the greatest merit of the entire system of special schools lay in the 
fact of its not being a system. The wonderful variety of vocational 
schools offered a possibility of adapting the schools to local needs, or 
to the industrial peculiarities of the localities in which they are situ- 
ated. The whole subject of classification and of a more definite 
organization of the system was referred to a committee for a future 
report.

THREE SYSTEMS OF CONTINUATION SCHOOLS IN PRUSSIA. 
The independent Prussian continuation or supplementary school 
is essentially a creation of the twentieth century. Independent, 
because it is not an integral part of the system of elementary or com- 
mon schools, though it builds upon their results. Formerly it was 
no more and no less than an educational repair shop, and as such the 
stepchild of public opinion and school administration. Since it has 
been separated from the elementary schools and made an independent 
institution its development has proceeded on new lines, so that to-day 
it has hardly a feature of the old continuation school except its name. 
A beneficent fate has removed it from too strict bureaucratic regula- 
tions. The strong, open-hearted initiative of the authorities has 
understood how to awaken latent germs in it, and to-day state and 
communities, teachers, merchants, and artisans, compete in building 
up systems of continuation schools worthy the name. 
The administrative reports of the royal Prussian industrial office, 
and the last volume of the Prussian Statistical Yearbook, give exact 
information concerning the progress of the systems of continuation 
schools, which goes into details too minute to reproduce. The Im- 
perial Labor Gazette (published by the imperial statistical bureau) 
has in its March number of 1909 (pp. 215-220) an article which 
contains valuable and rare information on the present status of the 
continuation schools of Prussia. In order not to create confusion in 
the mind of the reader, it may be stated that the schools mentioned 
here are not trade, or monotechnical, schools, though they are to 
some extent vocational. The real trade, or vocational, schools of 
Prussia are mentioned in the Annual Report of the Commissioner of 
Education of 1908 (pp. 267-275), where also a number of courses of 
study of such schools are sketched. 
The three systems, known as (1) industrial continuation schools, 
(2) commercial continuation schools, and (8) agricultural continua- 
tion schools, are sketched in the article in the Imperial Labor Gazette 
referred to, which appeared also in the Statistical Supplement of the 
Berlin Paidagogische Zeitung. 
I.—INDUSTRIAL CONTINUATION SCHOOLS. 
The first comprehensive statistics of these schools in Prussia were 
published in 1874. According to that publication there were only 
435 such institutions, 43 of them in the province of Hanover, 50 in 
the county of Wiesbaden, 15 in the county of Cassel, and 23 in the 
province of Schleswig-Holstein. In 176 of such schools attendance 
was compulsory. During the same year the state legislature (the 
diet) appropriated 142,140 marks ($33,750) for their maintenance. 
Up to that year subsidies had been given only by the department of 
industry and public works. For a number of years following, statis-
-P-A-G-E-499

tical information is lacking. During the last five years the growth of 
the system of industrial continuation schools for boys has been as 
follows:

Besides these schools, there are in larger cities industrial schools 
for girls. Exact statistics concerning their attendance are not avail- 
able. In the foregoing table it is noticeable that the schools with 
obligatory attendance increase, while those with voluntary attendance 
decrease. The opponents of local obligatory attendance can not 
derive much comfort from the figures presented. The rapid devel- 
opment of compulsory attendance brushes contrary arguments aside, 
and compulsion is victorious, even before a state law decrees it. The 
expense necessary to carry the local laws of compulsory attendance 
into effect can not be an obstacle, for everyone is ‘convinced of the 
necessity of a better education of industrial laborers, so that both 
State and communities are ready to make large appropriations for 
that purpose. Those of the State have increased 100 per cent since 
1901, to wit: 
  
Year. Marks. Year. Marks. 
    
The communities are obliged to offer free the required buildings or 
rooms, including light and heat. After deducting the tuition fees 
from the amount necessary for the support of the school, the State 
supplies, according to the financial capacity of the community, from 
one-fourth to three-fourths of the remaining expenses. Usually 
there are other sources of support besides those derived from tuition, 
local taxation, and the state treasury. Thus, for instance, the total 
amount needed for the support of industrial continuation schools in 
the two provinces, Rhineland and Westphalia, in 1905-6 (77 schools 
with 44,628 students and 1,155,858 marks expenses), was derived from 
the following sources:

II.— COMMERCIAL CONTINUATION SCHOOLS. 
The growth of the commercial continuation school system in its 
early stages was bound up with that of the industrial continuation 
school system, and even to-day it is not everywhere clearly separated 
from the latter. Since 1904 the following statistics are published:

The commercial continuation schools are not as numerous nor as 
large as the schools for artisans. The 1,579 industrial schools with 
their 280,427 students outnumber the 857 commercial schools with 
their 43,584 students. The view that business clerks, more than any 
other wage-earners, need a thorough and continuous education, is 
not held generally. The means of support for these schools are 
derived differently from those of industrial schools. Communities 
and chambers of commerce chiefly support commercial schools, and 
since the tuition fees are not insignificant (15 to 80 marks, or $3.37 
to $7.14, a month), these schools, to a large extent, support them- 
selves. The part of the expenses not covered by tuition fees is de- 
frayed equally by communities, State, and chambers of commerce. 
In the cities of Oppeln and Halberstadt special agreements are made 
with the state authorities. Other chambers, as for instance that of 
Berlin, maintain schools without state subsidies. 
The state subsidies for commercial continuation schools were as

  IlI.—RURAL CONTINUATION SCHOOLS. 
The organization of rural continuation schools was for the first 
time uniformly regulated by a joint order issued by the ministers of 
the interior department, the department of public instruction, and the 
department of agriculture February 2, 1876. Before that date such 
schools had been established and maintained by voluntary efforts in 
several provinces, and everywhere, but especially in the county (gov- 
ernmental district) of Wiesbaden, they had proved beneficial. That 
one county had, in the winter of 1874-75, already 91 rural continua- 
tion schools, with 1,570 students. Of these students, 1,450 were be- 
tween 14 and 20 years of age, 108 between 21 and 30, and 12 between 
31 and 40. 
The development of the rural continuation schools in Prussia is 
plainly seen from the following table:

During the decade 1898-1907, the number of agricultural continua- 
tion schools newly established was 2,511; the number of students 
increased 36,880, and the expenditures 432,154 marks, during the 
same period. In what proportion the different provinces of Prussia 
have progressed in late years in maintaining such schools is seen 
from the following table:

The province of Hesse-Nassau, provides best for the education of 
its rural youth. Hanover, too, stands well in the foregoing list. In 
Posen, Brandenburg, Silesia, and East Prussia some progress has 
“been made, while in West Prussia, Pomerania, and Saxony com- 
paratively little improvement is noticeable. In most cases the found- 
ers of rural continuation schools are the communities and the school 
districts. The means of support are derived chiefly from state sub- 
sidies, partly also from counties and rural communities. The total 
expenditure for such schools was raised from:

RURAL HIGH SCHOOLS IN DENMARK. 
  Since many European authorities, in their efforts in behalf of uni- 
versity extension among the rural population, have taken the Danish 
people’s high schools as models, it is well to see what is done in the 
Kingdom of Denmark in this direction. In No. 11 of the Docu- 
ments of Progress, Mr. Holger Begtup, of Copenhagen, states that 
these institutions have become the most important factors of the 
intellectual and economic development of the rural population, inas- 
much as they have raised the culture of the farmers quite beyond 
the hopes of the founders of the first of them. The first people’s 
high school was established in Rédding (North Schleswig) in 1844. 
Later, in 1870, Christian Kold established one on the island of Tiinen, 
which became the model for many others. The students not only 
studied together in class, but lived in the institution. Dormitories 
are now connected with all these institutions. Though they are 
called “ Folkehoiskole ” (literally people’s high schools), the word 
“ Folke,” or “ people,” should by rights be replaced by “ rural,” for 
the word “ people ” is used in contradistinction to city population. 
If a high school is established and maintained by the people of a 
city, it would not be called a “ people’s” but a “city ” high school. 
The people, in the Danish conception of the term, are those who live 
outside of cities. 
At present (in 1908) there are 70 such rural high schools with 
over 7,000 students. Most of them receive state subsidies. In 1906 
as many as 3,493 young men and 8,196 young women were enrolled 
in such subsidized schools. Two-thirds of the students range in age 
between 18 and 25, one-third are older. The course for the young 
men begins November 1 and ends April 1; the course for young 
women begins May 1 and ends August 1. The branches taught are 
 
-P-A-G-E-504
  492 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
as follows: Oral and written use of the mother tongue; history of 
Denmark and other countries, with the necessary geography and 
popular natural science. There is no instruction in agriculture. The 
tuition fees per month amount to 35 crowns ($17.05), which includes 
board and lodging. Many students (in 1907 there were 2,551) 
receive scholarships of 25 crowns ($12.18) a month. The students 
come from rural homes; they are mostly sons and daughters of small 
leaseholders, farmers, and artisans. Of the total number of students 
(about 7,000), there were 395 who had their homes in cities. 
One important feature of these schools is that they are not con- 
sidered part and parcel of the State’s system of popular education, 
hence the state government has nothing to do with their management 
and supervision. It leaves them alone, except that each of these high 
schools receives, on an average, something like 3,000 crowns a year 
from the Government as a subsidy. This freedom from govern- 
mental interference allows these schools to adapt themselves to the 
needs of localities as well as to the educational preparation of their 
students. Procrustean courses of study, or requirements of admis- 
sion, are not found in these schools. The students of these rural high 
schools have a popular university at Askov to look forward to, where 
a two-year course of thorough scientific study and foreign languages 
is offered. 
The influence of the Danish rural high schools upon the civiliza- 
tion and culture of the country is undeniable. In the Danish Par- 
liament at Copenhagen sit many deputies who have received no 
higher education than is offered in these rural high schools; even one 
of the members of the King’s cabinet is a graduate of a “ people’s” 
high school. 
The Danes who came to the United States have, true to the tradi- 
tions of their native country, established 13 people’s high schools, 
after the models in Denmark, namely, in the States of Nebraska, 
Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Michigan. 
Sweden and Norway have also followed the example of Denmark. 
Sweden has 39 people’s high and 24 agricultural high schools. The 
number of such schools in Norway is not stated, but the number of 
students is 634. 
Finland also has established 26 such schools, having 1,223 students. 
GRADUATES OF SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN GERMANY. 
The ten universities of Prussia received in 1908 from the three 
kinds of secondary schools $7,457 native students. Foreign students 
are excluded from the following computation, they not having re- 
ceived their preparation in German secondary schools. It is in-

structive to see what proportion of these 27,457 freshmén came from 
the Gymnasia or classical high schools, in which Latin, Greek, and a 
modern tongue are taught; how many came from Realgymnasia, 
schools in which Latin and two modern languages are taught; and 
lastly, how many came from Oberrealschulen, in which neither Latin 
nor Greek, but two modern languages, are taught and which devote 
much time to mathematics and natural sciences. 
The following table gives the actual figures for each university 
faculty and the totals in numbers and percentages. These percent- 
ages would not be materially different if the new students of polytech- 
nic institutes and other seats of higher education were included, 
for the classical high schools, the Gymnasia, have a remarkably strong 
hold on the people. The schools without Latin (Lateinlose héhere 
Schulen), such as Realschulen, Biirgerschulen, and Mittelschulen, 
prepare their students chiefly for commercial and industrial pursuits. 
Their increase is truly phenomenal and can well be compared with 
the astonishing increase in public high schools in this country during 
the last twenty or thirty years.

In eight non-Prussian universities the proportions were about the 
same. Thus out of a total of 31,622 students in 18 out of 21 German 
universities (Munich, Erlangen, and Wiirzburg not reporting) 24,876, 
or 78.5 per cent, were graduates of classical high schools, 4,417, or 
14 per cent, of semiclassical high schools, and 7.5 per cent of scientific 
high schools. 
COST OF SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN GERMANY. 
The per capita cost of secondary education in Germany is very 
much greater than that of elementary education, as it is in every 
country; but it is difficult to give a detailed statement of the cost for 
 
-P-A-G-E-506
    494 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
the whole country, or even for the separate States, because secondary 
schools in Germany are not a part of the general scheme of school 
administration, being supported in part by ancient endowments and 
by tuition fees; while many receive state subsidies, others are royal 
schools, and still others are municipal schools, to which the State 
pays no contribution at all, though all secondary schools of whatever 
nature, whether classical, semiclassical, modern, or scientific, and 
whatever their sources of support may be, are subject to the State’s 
supervision and regulation. 
On the other hand, the elementary schools keing gratuitous since 
1888, the sources of their support are so well known through the 
annual state and city appropriations that there is little difficulty in 
comparing their cost with that in other countries. 
Recently the Prussian city of Frankfort on the Main offered an 
opportunity for comparing the cost of secondary schools, which may 
be used as an example, for the conditions prevailing there are similar 
to those in other large cities of the Empire. In 1907-8 the secondary 
schools for boys—that is, the classical, semiclassical, and scientific 
schools in Frankfort—cost $70.20 per capita of the students. If the 
state subsidy be added, the per capita is $98.33. The cost of secondary 
schools for girls amounted to $44.49 per capita, or, with the State’s 
contribution, $77.65. The per capita for middle or intermediate 
schools is less, namely, $30.47, or, including the State’s contribution, 
$40.83. The per capita for elementary schools is $20.25, or, including 
the State’s contribution, $26.66. 
From this it is plainly seen that a pupil of the boys’ secondary 
school, counting only the expenditures derived from local sources, 
costs almost three and a half times as much as a pupil of the ele- 
mentary (Volks) schools, and that in a comparison with the other 
types of schools the elementary does not make a much better show- 
ing. The customary ratio seems to be 1 to 3, or 3}. It does not 
require much penetration to see that the per capita of elementary 
schools need not be as high as that of secondary schools, but German 
elementary teachers express the opinion that more should be spent 
upon appliances for teaching, free books, school libraries, labora- 
tories, workbenches, cooking utensils, drawing appliances, and suit- 
able rooms for the so-called “ supplementary branches of study.” 
The laboratory appliances needed for secondary schools are 
necessarily more expensive than for elementary schools; so are 
the collections of natural objects, the text-books, and the school 
libraries. There does not seem to be too great a difference between 
the expenditures of Gymnasia and those of primary schools, if the 
fact be considered that the former are the colleges of Germany, and a 
college education is proverbially costly. Another difference, namely, 
the one between boys’ Gymnasia ($70.20) and girls’ high schools

($44.49), though perhaps characteristic of the valuation set upon 
higher education of girls in Germany, is not likely to be found in this 
country. 
NEW AGENCIES OF HIGHER EDUCATION IN GERMANY. 
THE HAMBURG COLONIAL INSTITUTE. 
Hamburg, the wealthy Hanse town and a German State, main- 
tained for many years a number of lecture courses for advanced stu- 
dents. For over ten years the question was agitated whether it 
would not be best to establish a university in Hamburg, and if so, 
whether the institution should be a commercial university like the 
one in Cologne, or a university of the old type, of which the Empire 
has 21. The government of the State of Hamburg finally decided to 
introduce a new type of school, a colonial institute, which could pre- 
pare young men for colonial service, and at the same time aid the over- 
sea business interests of the famous old center of foreign commerce. 
This institute was opened at the close of the year 1908 with 36 
students. It is to be a university for planters, merchants, and offi- 
cials who intend to go to the colonies, and also a point where scientific 
and colonial endeavors can concentrate. In preparing young men 
for life in the colonies, the institution will not only impart knowledge, 
but will also be instrumental in infusing a spirit of self-dependence 
into the would-be colonists and settlers, from which, it is hoped, 
much benefit and advantage will ultimately accrue to the mother 
country. The programme of the institute contains the following 
announcement: 
The curriculum is based on the idea that immediate and practical advantage 
must not be aimed at, so much as free theoretic interest in all that tends to- 
ward the progress of science, experience having taught that scientific work is 
ultimately serviceable and beneficial to practical life. The course of study 
includes law, political economy, philology, history, geography, medicine, and the 
natural sciences, but in all cases adapted to the special needs of the colonies. 
The lectures on colonial politics and on profit-sharing colonial plants will be 
supplemented by excursions to warehouses and factories where colonial produce 
is prepared for the European market, so that the lecturer can demonstrate, 
with the entire process before him, how the raw material is treated and the 
place of the product in the commercial world. Geography and geology will be 
taught side by side, and the lectures will be illustrated in the course of ex- 
cursions to different parts of Germany where diversified geological formations 
and the methods of adapting them to cultivation can be observed. 
An additional course of lectures will be devoted to an explanation of the 
best manner of preparing food in the Tropics, and the students will be trained 
to give first aid in cases of accidents and ordinary tropical complaints. The 
elements of veterinary surgery will be taught, and in view of the advance of

496 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
Oriental semicivilization, which appeals to the natives more strongly than does 
European civilization, a course of lectures on Islamism will be delivered. 
The administration of the new colonial institute will be in the hands of a 
council of professors, of which Doctor Thulenius is president, but in order to 
keep theory in constant touch with practice, the council will be augmented 
by three merchants, at present engaged in colonial trade. Doctor Stuhlmann, 
who has lived in German East Africa for many years, is the secretary of the 
institute. 
LECTURE COURSES AT MANNHEIM. 
In Mannheim on the Rhine the customary courses of lectures for 
advanced students, which eventually will crystallize into a university, 
as similar attempts did in Frankfort, Cologne, and Hamburg, have 
been greatly augmented for the winter semester of 1908-9. The 
programme contained 50 professional courses by 28 professors. New 
branches have been added to the departments of political economy, 
namely: History of economics, statistics, state and city debts, and 
insurance. Also, lecture courses on social policy, women’s factory 
labor, oceanic and river navigation, problems of banking and ex- 
change legislation, as well as tariff legislation. In the department 
of law, lectures on bankruptcy and mortgages, as well as on commer- 
cial and industrial contracts, have been added. The city authorities 
hope to obtain substantial additions to the funds already secured so as 
to build an institution which will serve the purpose contemplated. 
The whole course consists of four semesters. The admission or 
matriculation fee is $4.76, and an additional fee of $28.56 for each 
semester. All fees are about 50 per cent higher for foreign students 
who wish to attend. Cards for attendance at lecture courses may be 
procured for $1.19 for courses having lectures one hour a week, $2.14 
for two hours a week, $2.85 for three hours, $3.57 for four hours, and 
$4.76 for five hours. Reductions are made to members of unions in 
Mannheim and vicinity. The students have the privilege of attend- 
ing lectures at the University of Heidelberg, which can be reached by 
train in twenty minutes. 
A UNIVERSITY CONTEMPLATED FOR POSEN. 
The old universities in Germany, 21 in number, are likely to have a 
new sister institution in the near future. The Prussian province of 
Posen, formerly a part of Poland, and still inhabited chiefly by 
Poles, though the Germans have made great progress in the possession 
of the land and of city property, has not as yet a university in a 
population of 1,986,637 (census of 1905) ; but it has the nucleus of a 
university in its Academy of Scientific Study in the city of Posen. 
The Prussian government would long ago have raised this institu- 
tion, which has already 1,000 students and 30 professors, to a full- 
fledged university of four faculties, if it had not entertained the ap- 
prehension that such an institution would become the center of Polish
-P-A-G-E-509
  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 497 
political agitation. At least, this is the argument advanced openly 
in the Prussian legislature. 
OTHER NEW INSTITUTIONS. 
The former 9 polytechnica of the Empire have been increased 
to 10 by the establishment of a technological university at Danzig at 
the mouth of the Vistula (Weichsel), the chief object of which is the 
preparation of shipbuilders and marine engineers. Among the higher 
institutions of learning, the commercial universities, of which there 
were 5 in 1909, will increase their number in the near future. Mann- 
heim on the Rhine, a great commercial center, and Solingen, the 
German center of the cutlery industry, are making great efforts 
toward founding such schools. 
RESOLUTIONS OF GERMAN UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS. 
The German University Teachers’ Congress, which met in Jena at 
the close of 1908, passed resolutions which are remarkably frank, and 
which are dictated by a spirit of independence quite in accord with 
the principle of “ Lehrfreiheit und Lernfreiheit,” which has been a 
characteristic of German higher education ever since the time of 
William von Humboldt, who, at the beginning of the nineteenth 
century, was the first minister of public instruction in Prussia. The 
resolutions are as follows: 
I. Scientific investigation and the transmission of its results must, according 
to their purpose, be independent of any consideration not inherent in their 
own scientific method—hence independent especially of tradition and prejudices 
of the people, independent of governmental authorities and social groups, as 
well as independent of monetary or other interests. 
II. This demand lies as much in the interests of the state as in those of 
science, because the increase and spread of knowledge can never injure society, 
but will always promote its best interests. 
III. This absolute independence needs no specific law to guarantee it, any 
more than other constitutional rights need special legislation for their pro- 
tection. 
IV. No limitation of the right to investigate and teach can be derived, directly 
or indirectly, from the official position of an investigator and teacher. 
VY. No exceptions whatever to these statements can be acknowledged con- 
cerning academic teachers of theology. 
VI. Conditions coupled with ancient endowments, if they conflict with the 
liberty to investigate and teach, can not limit the right defined in the foregoing 
statement, because such conditions have become invalid by the law of custom. 
Furthermore, because all existing German universities have become state insti- 
tutions, whose maintenance would be utterly impossible if dependent alone upon 
ancient endowments, their public character may not be limited by private 
purposes.

-P-A-G-E-510
    
498 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
VII. From Paragraph II the danger of denominational universities, estab- 
lished and supervised by church authorities, is recognized, even though the 
course of study of such institutions be granted the same rights of independence 
which are inherent in state institutions. 
These resolutions were adopted after a thorough and protracted 
discussion, in which it was repeatedly asserted that theological insti- 
tutions that would not admit the fundamental prerogative of an 
academic teacher, i. e., the liberty of his conviction, could not claim 
equal rights with institutions which grant that prerogative without 
reserve. 
PARTICIPATION OF THE GERMAN STATES IN UNIVERSITY 
ATTENDANCE. 
The report of 1908 of the minister of public instruction of Prussia 
(vol. 204 of Preussische Statistik) gives a list of the 26 States com- 
prising the German Empire, and their relative university attendance, 
as shown in the following table:

These numbers reveal the fact that South Germany? supplies a 
relatively greater number of students than Prussia and Saxony. 
This is notable because the south has many more small-shop industries 
and smaller farms than the north. The proportion of Prussia would 
be smaller still if Berlin, with its 22.66 students per 10,000 male in- 
habitants, were excluded. Of the 13 Prussian provinces, 9 remain 
below the Prussian average; the province of West Prussia, with the 
city of Dantzig, has only 7.38; Schleswig-Holstein, 8.30; Posen, 8.38; 
Pomerania, 9.28; east Prussia, with the city of Konigsberg, 9.86.   
«Bavaria, Baden, Wurttemberg, Alsace-Lorraine, and part of Hesse.

The chiefly agricultural districts of the north furnish few uni- 
versity students, while the agricultural districts of the south furnish 
many more than the Prussian average, and more than the average 
of the Empire. Grouping the numbers according to larger zones 
we arrive at the following results: 
Among every 10,000 male inhabitants we find: 
1892-93. | 1905-6. 
  
First zone, east and north Germany. 9.44 10.90 Second zone, middle and west Germ: 10.26 12.63 Third zone, south Germany........- 12.30 14. 
    
It is to be remembered that Berlin, with its large attendance, is 
situated in the first zone. 
Whether analogous results would be noticed if the attendance of 
technological institutes, agricultural colleges, mining academies, and 
other higher seats of learning were considered, can not be stated 
with certainty. The attendance at universities was alone considered, 
because it is in universities where the civil officers (nearly all pro- 
fessional men, clergymen, judges, state attorneys, physicians, health 
officers, mayors, and secondary teachers are in the State’s service) 
receive their preparation. Another point is that Catholic States, 
like Bavaria and Baden, furnish more university students than 
Protestant States. 
In a few years the relative attendance will be greatly changed, 
since Prussia has opened its universities to women. The results of 
the first matriculation of female students at the universities of Prus- 
sia are as follows: The total number admitted is 663, of whom 461 
are from Prussia and 202 from other States. The university of 
Berlin matriculates 400, Gottingen 71, Bonn 69, Breslau 50, Mar- 
burg 27, Halle 22, Konigsberg 17, Greifswald 5, and Kiel 2. Of the 
total number, 363 study philosophy, philology, and history; 134, 
medicine; 108, mathematics and natural science; 25, dentistry; 22, 
political economy; 6, law; 3, evangelical theology, and 2, pharmacy. 
The German technological institutes had, in the winter of 1908-9, 
1,230 matriculated women students. 
Of the female university students from non-German States, 43 are 
from America, 35 from Russia, 14 from Austria-Hungary, 7 from 
England, 6 from France, 4 from Roumania, 3 from Switzerland, 2 
from Italy, 1 each from Denmark, Holland, Norway, Servia, and 
Australia. In addition to these matriculated female students, there 
are 958 females enrolled in various lines of hospital work at the 
Prussian universities.

500 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
CHAIRS OF PEDAGOGY IN GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 
Doctor von Wehner, minister of public instruction in Bavaria, 
recently replied to a parliamentary inquiry concerning the estab- 
lishment of separate chairs of pedagogy in Bavarian universities, 
as follows: 
In 1907 the Royal Government submitted to the senates of the three Bavarian 
universities the question whether it was advisable not only to establish sepa- 
rate chairs of pedagogy, but also to connect practice schools with them. Com- 
prehensive replies, with arguments pro or con, it was intimated, would be wel- 
come. The reports of the three universities (Munich, Wiirzburg, and Erlangen) 
were received in due time by the Government. The senates of Munich and 
Wiirzburg declared themselves opposed to separate pedagogic chairs, and the 
senate of Erlangen advised the establishment of a new chair of philosophy, the 
especial duty of which it might be made to treat pedagogy. The introduction 
of practice schools into the universities was rejected by all three senates. 
The arguments of the university senates of Munich and Wiirzburg against 
the establishment of professorships of pedagogy were as follows: 
I. Pedagogy as an isolated science is incapable of producing creative scien- 
tific works. 
II. Pedagogy as a university discipline would presuppose universal knowl- 
edge in its representative. Since that is impossible, it would be necessary for 
every university to arrange for an entire pedagogical faculty, analogous to the 
faculties of theology, law, medicine, and philosophy. Only thus could the 
special didactics of each branch of study be represented. 
III. An introduction into the psychological foundations of pedagogy can 
take place only through a representative of systematic philosophy who is famil- 
iar with the method of experimental psychology. 
IV. For theoretical pedagogical preparation of students of theology the pres- 
ent arrangements are quite sufficient. 
Vv. The practical preparation of future secondary teachers properly belongs 
to the pedagogical seminaries connected with high schools, that of teachers of 
elementary schools to model classes in normal schools. The university, as such, 
has other objects in view; it has to promote the professional and purely human 
preparation of students. 
VI. Connecting model or practice schools with the universities would raise 
objections concerning the principles upon which university education rests; 
it would also create great administrative difficulties relating to the teachers of 
such schools, their pupils, and local school conditions. 
It is, therefore [concluded the minister], not considered necessary to estab- 
lish separate chairs for pedagogy; all three senates raising objections to the 
plan, the Government is induced to dismiss the question for the present. 
It may be added that in several leading universities, such as Berlin, 
Leipzig, Marburg, and Jena, pedagogy is represented by a number of 
chairs of philosophy, but a model school for experimental teaching is 
found only in Jena.

CHAPTER XI. 
SCHOOLS FOR CRIPPLED CHILDREN ABROAD. 
By Everyn May Go.psMItTH, 
President of Association of Public School Teachers of Crippled Children in the City of 
New York. 
In no department of education in Europe has greater progress been 
made during the last twenty-five years than in that which has to do 
with the physical, mental, and moral training of crippled children. 
The greatest advance in the education of the deformed in connec- 
tion with the regular system of public schools is to be seen in Great 
Britain, especially in London, Liverpool, Glasgow, and Edinburgh, 
where many public schools of a special character have been established 
for crippled children. 
The greatest advance in trade schools for adults where crippled 
men and women are taught to earn their own living is found in 
Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. Here workshops have been estab- 
lished for over forty years, and within most recent times have been 
greatly enlarged and extended. These schools, which are in reality 
homes, are supported by grants from the Government and private 
donations, and while doing most effective work are often handi- 
capped by need of funds. 
DENMARK. 
The mother school was first started in Copenhagen in 1872, and is 
still the only one in Denmark. From this many in other countries 
have been patterned. Large additions are now in process of con- 
struction, and in a year it will become an ideal educational center 
for the disabled of Denmark. In this school many trades are well 
developed, the aim of which is to fit the pupils to go out into the 
world and take positions that will render them self-supporting. 
An attempt is being made to help the pupils to “ learn to do things 
that pay,” or, according to Miss Peterson, the head of the school, to 
teach them “ to do their own living.” 
The institution has five divisions, namely: 
I. Clinic, where patients are treated and bandages, wooden legs; 
special corsets, boots, etc., are supplied. These are made, at the 
order of the doctors in attendance, by the pupils in the workshops, 
508  
-P-A-G-E-516
  504 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
some of whom have become teachers and are now holding positions 
in other institutions. 
Il. Workrooms, (a) where bandagemaking, moldmaking, corset- 
making, saddlery, forging, and shoemaking are taught, the articles 
made being for the use of the cripples. Here are numbers of pupils 
without hands, wearing appliances which enable them to hold a tool 
and steady the material worked upon; (4) school of handicraft and 
manual work, consisting of wood carving, bookbinding, brushmaking, 
joinery, dressmaking, weaving, needlework, housekeeping, cooking, 
and office work. The age of the pupils varies from 14 to 26. 
III. A home, where pupils from the country live during ap- 
prenticeship. Dinner is supplied to children from the city as well as 
those in residence. All the furniture of this home is made by the 
children, and is of most careful and exquisite workmanship. 
IV. Child’s school, where the rudimentary branches are taught. 
In addition, emphasis is laid upon the musical training, the singing 
being unusually fine. 
V. Recreation home, at the seaside, for the most diseased patients, 
accommodating 44. 
SWEDEN. 
In Sweden industrial schools for adult cripples were established at 
Gothenburg and Karlskrona in 1885, at Helsingborg in 1887, and in 
Stockholm in 1892. In the city of Stockholm, though great care is 
taken of the health of children going to the public schools, yet their 
doors are not thrown open to crippled children. Special teachers are 
supplied by the public schools to teach these latter in their homes 
after school hours. A most careful supervision is exercised over the 
physical condition of the public-school pupils. If defects are ob- 
served, the teacher sends the child to the royal gymnasium, where 
curative gymnasium treatment is given free of charge to the poor. 
Though not having public schools for the crippled, Stockholm has 
two industrial schools for these unfortunates, supported solely by 
private contributions—one, the Society in Aid of the Deformed and 
Infirm, caring especially for adults, enabling them to provide for 
themselves as far as possible, and the other, the Eugenia Hemmet’s, 
admitting both adults and children. The Society for the Deformed 
and Infirm admits pupils ranging in age from 9 to 57. In both 
institutions instruction is given free of cost, and the poorest pupils 
dine every day at the expense of the school. As soon as the work of 
the pupil is salable the school gives him payment for it. 
Most remarkable is the dexterity attained by persons who have only 
one normal hand but two vigorous legs. Of such persons, a woman 
working at a sewing machine and a man at a turning lathe are able 
to gain as great dexterity and, when their apprenticeship is ended, to
-P-A-G-E-517
SCHOOLS FOR CRIPPLED CHILDREN ABROAD. 505 
earn as much money as bodily normal workers. A great variety is 
to be found in the objects made. Brushes of various kinds and fur- 
niture, such as tables, desks, chairs, etc., are made in large quantities. 
In the bookbinding division orders are taken for the binding of books, 
and in the shoe shop for the making of new shoes and the mending of 
old. In the girls’ sewing room are made embroidered pillows, etc., 
and hand-woven towels, while machine work is done in dressmaking 
and knitting. 
The Eugenia Hemmet’s is one of the most ideal schools in the 
matter of situation and equipment in Europe. The rooms are most 
artistically decorated. Plants are everywhere in bloom, birds sing 
in cages, and beautiful pictures adorn the walls; when possible, the 
furniture in the class rooms is painted white. 
The enrollment is 190. It is a noteworthy fact that no cripples are 
seen on the streets. 
This community is divided into families, two or three nurses 
looking after each family. In this school the chief stress is laid 
upon giving to the pupil a good general education, rather than a 
training in the trades. One hundred of the children are divided 
into five classes, where they are instructed especially in English and 
arithmetic. In special Class I a girl with only a thumb writes 
beautifully. In Class II a boy of 15 has no legs, but does his work 
enthusiastically. A number of the children are in beds in the class 
room. In the kindergarten is a child 4 years old, born without arms, 
who can sew, paint, and cut as easily and correctly as a normal child. 
A band composed of 8 boys who have a teacher twice a week plays, 
leaning on crutches while they play. 
The remaining 90 children are placed in different shops. In the 
tailor shops the clothing for the whole school is made, every child 
receiving two suits a year, one of them at Christmas time. Orders 
are taken for the knitting of stockings for the soldiers. 
NORWAY. 
Sophie’s Minde, the large school for cripples in Norway, is in 
Christiania, situated on a hill overlooking the city. This school 
stands especially for manual training and shows that the most help- 
less cripples are capable of the finest handicraft. One girl lying in 
a wheeled bed works with her paralyzed hand and mouth in making 
lace with colored pins on a cushion. Another, who has lost her arms 
by amputation, makes a variety of exquisite laces, using her teeth 
alone, throwing the bobbins from side to side and occasionally with 
her teeth picking up an instrument to tighten the pattern when 
necessary. A man without fingers uses instruments in the palms of 
his hands, and carves most intricate designs in furniture.

  506 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909, 
GREAT BRITAIN. 
In Great Britain the schools for crippled children are a recognized 
part of the system of public instruction. 
These schools, it is important to note, are in buildings of their 
own, and are equipped with furniture and appliances especially 
adapted to the needs of the crippled child. A piano is in each room. 
Each school has an ambulance or two, constructed especially at great 
expense, to admit children on stretchers and in invalid chairs, and 
all children are conveyed to and from their homes. A nurse or a 
paid attendant accompanies each ambulance. When the ambulance 
arrives the children are given cod liver oil and medicines prescribed 
by their physicians, and at the morning recess crackers and milk. 
The largest number of schools is in London; upon these the schools 
of other countries have been modeled; Glasgow, Edinburgh, and 
Liverpool are next in the lead. 
Glasgow.—In Glasgow there are four well-developed schools, the 
Freeland, Bridgeton, Finnieston, and Hayfield schools. Here the 
plan is much alike—all in special buildings or old buildings remod- 
eled to fit the needs of these children. The Hayfield school is espe- 
cially ideal; for though it is a separate new building by itself, it is 
considered part of the big Hayfield School for Normal Children, 
which is a model building throughout—built somewhat on the style 
of our New York model buildings. 
A typical time-table of the Glasgow schools is as follows: 
A. M. 
9.20— 9.55. Religious instruction. 
9.55-10.10. Arithmetic (mental). 
10.10-10.15. Register. 
10.15-10.30. Arithmetic. 
10.30—10.45. Cod liver oil and chemical food mixed, milk and crackers. 
10.45-11.00. Geography. 
11.00-12.00. English. 
12.00— 1.00. Dinner and recess. 
P. M. 
1.00- 1.05. Register. 
1.05— 2.00. Drawing, needlework, brush work, basketry, games. 
All chairs and reclining sofas are fitted to the children, and thereby 
add to the children’s comfort. Here also the aid society assists with 
the dinners. 
Edinburgh—tThe especially noticeable feature of the Edinburgh 
schools is the emphasis placed upon the surroundings of the schools. 
The playgrounds and gardens are beautifully arranged. The chil- 
dren have their own garden plats and care for their flowers and 
vegetables. This out-of-door work is considered very essential for 
crippled children. 
 
-P-A-G-E-519
  
SCHOOLS FOR CRIPPLED CHILDREN ABROAD. 507 
Liverpool.—Next in importance to London as regards schools for 
cripples is Liverpool. The special schools, of which there are six, 
are carried on under the elementary education act of 1899, which 
empowers but does not require local authorities to provide for the 
instruction of physically and mentally defective children—children 
who by reason of mental or physical defect are incapable of receiving 
proper benefit from instruction in ordihary elementary schools, but 
are not incapable by reason of such defect of receiving benefit from 
instruction in special schools. Three of the schools, Dingel Lane, 
Whitefield Road, and Chatham Place, are “ double” schools and pro- 
vide for both physically and mentally defective children. Two, 
Frontenoy Street and Orwell Road, provide for mentally defective 
children only, and one, the West Kirby School, for physically defec- 
tive children only. The schools are as follows: 
I. The Whitefield Road School. Here are 102 physically and 55 
mentally defective children. Manual work and the kindergarten are 
well developed. A midday meal is provided for each child, and the 
children are conveyed to and from school in ambulances, especially 
constructed at a cost of $460 each. The premises are new and con- 
venient, having been especially erected for the purpose. Here chil- 
dren are taken from 5 to 16 years of age. All classes are termed 
special classes. In this school much hand work of careful design is 
accomplished. In embroidery and work chipping the children draw 
their own designs. Water colors and stains are used on various white 
work, and marquetery work is much done on white wood—tables, 
frames, etc., being most popular. Hand machines are used in the 
making of clothing. Cookery and household work are studied, and 
shoe making and mending are made much of. Vocal music is a 
strong feature. The windows in this new building are arranged to 
drop entirely out of sight, as in a carriage, so as to admit much fresh 
air to the room. As Miss Williams, the head mistress, said, “ More 
essential than medicine is fresh air.” 
II. The Dingle Lane School registers 101 physically and 104 men- 
tally defective children. Here again the manual training depart- 
ment and the kindergarten are noted as well developed.: 
III. The Chatham Place-School, the largest of all, is composed 
of three dwelling houses converted into a special school—the cripples 
occupying the first floor and the mental defectives the floor above. 
A great point is made of nature study and gardening in this school. 
Children are taken between the ages of 5 and 16 and are divided 
into seven classes. All classes are called special classes from the 
lowest, Special A, up. Many original designs in basketry are worked 
out here, and again much chip work. The head mistress, Miss James, 
feels that toy making has a big future for the crippled child. Milli-  
-P-A-G-E-520
  508 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
nery, also paper flowers and plasticine, a kind of clay work, are 
taught with good results. 
IV. A small school at West Kirby for physically defective chil- 
dren, carried on by an educational committee in connection with the 
children’s convalescent home, enrolls 33 pupils. The aid society 
pays half the price of the appliances, crutches, braces, etc., needed 
for the children. 
London.—In London is found provision for the instruction and 
physical improvement of crippled children which is far in advance 
of that of any other country, and from that city New York has 
most to learn. For there overcrowded conditions are much as we 
find them in New York, with the inevitable accompaniment of 
physically and mentally defective children. In London both are 
taken care of, but the mentally and the physically defective are 
housed separately. 
In 1886 there was formed an Invalid Children’s Aid Society which 
made many experiments. Then Mrs. Humphrey Ward became in- 
terested and induced the London school board to take up a scheme 
in 1898 which she had worked out at the Passmore Edwards Settle- 
ment in Farvistock place. She had obtained the use of some good 
ground-floor rooms leading out into a beautiful garden with a nurse 
to superintend, and generously presented an ambulance to convey 
the 25 children to and from the settlement. As this was very suc- 
cessful, the board promptly put through a plan in February, 1899, 
providing the teacher and school furniture. Thus the first “ Invalid 
Center,” as it is called, was established. Since then, 23 centers, with 
over 1,880 children on the rolls, have been formed. Mrs. Ward’s 
school has been the model upon which the other centers have been 
planned. 
An india-rubber-tired ambulance, fitted with seats or with benches 
for the children brought on stretchers, starts on its round at 8.30. 
It is in charge of a nurse or a paid helper and the children are de- 
posited at the school at 10 o’clock. This nurse superintends the 
children in the stage, examines them when ill, gives medicine pre- 
scribed by the doctors, gets on friendly terms with the mothers, and 
forms a valuable link between the home and the hospital. In addi- 
tion, she orders the dinners and superintends the meal and recrea- 
tion time, giving the teachers an hour and a half rest. 
In making her experiment Mrs. Ward saw that no school could be 
successfully carried on without a hot midday meal for the pupils, 
and: she organized the Crippled Children’s Dinner Society to pro- 
vide a hot dinner daily. A good hot dinner of meat, vegetables, 
bread, and pudding is provided for 2d. Sometimes this is varied 
by potato pie or vegetable soup, as the nurse thinks fit. The board
-P-A-G-E-521
     SCHOOLS FOR CRIPPLED CHILDREN ABROAD. 
  .509 
  furnishes the kitchen, firing, and cook. The cook is responsible to 
the head teacher for the proper performance of her duties. 
The dinners are under the care of the above-mentioned society, one 
representative manager being elected from each school. The man- 
agers meet monthly (I was fortunate enough to attend one meeting), 
accounts and menus are examined, and every case of inability to pay 
2d. is carefully sifted. Free dinners are given only under excep- 
tional circumstances, and it is a noteworthy fact that in the report 
of 1907 it is stated that only 4 per cent of free dinners were given, 
although these children come from the lowest and poorest slums of 
London. 
The after training of these children is under the care of the same 
society that controls the dinners. As the child nears 16 (which is 
the special school age for leaving) his achievements are carefully 
noted and brought before the committee, and work suited as far as 
possible to the requirements of the particular child is found. 
To these centers are sent children suffering from heart disease, 
paralysis, or overtaxed brains and nerves who can not stand the 
bustle of a large school. Occasionally children with very defective 
eyesight are admitted who are not blind enough to be taught in the 
“blind center.” 
These invalids’ centers are under the care of Mrs. Burgwin, super- 
visor; Doctor Eichholz, medical inspector, and Dr. R. C. Elmslie, 
assistant medical inspector, whose work is practically indispensable. 
Doctor Elmslie has special record cards, and is making a great study 
of the problems encountered in the education of crippled children. 
I saw him examine the children of a school. 
The head mistress and nurse of each school both keep special 
records as to a child’s health. In a recent report Doctor Elmslie 
says: “Schools do not see sufficiently that efficient medical and sur- 
gical treatment is carried out and that the results are satisfactory.” 
He estimates that 20 per cent of these children will earn their living 
at a trade later in life, 50 per cent more if work in which they are 
especially skilled can be found, while 30 per cent will be unable to 
support themselves. 
In the Royal National Orthopedic Hospital, Great Portland street, 
and in the Alexandra Hip Hospital, where hip and special cases are 
admitted for very long periods, classes are formed under teachers of 
the London board schools. Thus these children do not retrograde 
mentally in spite of prolonged hospital treatment, and are fit to take 
their places again in the “ special centers ” when they are discharged. 
The London board schools go still further, and the “ Guild of the 
Brave Poor Things,” at Chailey, an invalid craft school founded by 
Mrs. Kimmans, is under the inspection of the board of education.    
  
-P-A-G-E-522
  510 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
Here wonderful workshops are found. All kinds of furniture and 
toys are made by the boys, while the girls are unexcelled in em- 
broidery and needlework. Much attention is given to athletics, the 
boys playing football, the girls cricket, and both performing on all 
kinds of apparatus. 
The most significant provisions of the rules for the London centers 
are the following: 
Buripine RULEs. 
N. B.—These rules must be read in conjunction with the building regulations for public 
elementary schools, 
I. Schools.—(a) Schools for various types of afflicted children should not be 
held in same building unless structurally separated. 
(b) All rooms for physically defective children must be on the ground floor. 
II. Playgrounds.—Where no field or other large space has been secured, the 
superficial area of the site should provide not less than 30 square feet per 
child of open space exclusive of buildings. There should be a large covered 
shed open on one side, provided with ample top light, which under supervision 
may be used by boys and girls together. 
III. Class rooms.—(a) Not less than 18 square feet of floor space per child 
must be provided. 
(b) No class room should contain less than 360 square feet of floor space. 
(c) The light should be ample and such as suits the mode of teaching 
employed. 
(d) Accommodation should be arranged for medical inspection. 
CuRRICULUM. 
The instruction should generally resemble that given in ordinary public 
elementary schools, 
Special schools for defective children should include the following subjects: 
The English language, including speaking with clear articulation and enuncia- 
tion, reading, writing, and recitation. 
Composition, study of literary matter, history, and geography. 
Arithmetic, including mental arithmetic and practical knowledge of money, 
weights, and measures. 
Knowledge of common things, including nature study and observation lessons. 
Drawing. 
Singing (including training in proper breathing). 
Plain needlework (for girls). 
Not less than six hours of manual instruction must be given weekly to each 
child. The forms of manual instruction must be chosen with a view of training 
manual and mental powers and of fitting the child to earn a living. Care must 
be taken to avoid the use of dangerous tools, 
TEACHERS—QUALIFICATIONS, 
Head teachers, when there are more than 10 children on the roll, must be 
certified under Schedule I of the Code, 6r hold the higher certificate of the 
National Froebel Union. 
No teacher will be recognized as a head teacher unless he or she has had some 
experience in a certified school for cripples. 
Assistant teachers must be either certificated or uncertificated teachers, or 
must hold the higher or elementary certificate of the National Froebel Union. 
Pupil teachers are not recognized as part of the staff.

SCHOOLS FOR CRIPPLED CHILDREN ABROAD. 511 
It is further prescribed that “the number of children in average 
attendance should not exceed 20 for each class.” 
In conclusion, it must be admitted that the expense of maintaining 
schools for cripples is heavy, but the care of the disabled child is 
eminently worth the while. 
Modern discoveries in surgery keep alive children who could hardly 
have survived their first decade a generation ago. Tubercular ab- 
scesses are opened, diseased bones are removed, and the result is that 
the child leaves the hospital cured in the eyes of the surgeon, but a 
maimed and battered creature in the eyes of its fellows. If the State 
is not going to provide an education for these children it is nurturing 
a whole army of prospective paupers. It is better to care for the 
individual during the comparatively short period of childhood rather 
than during the longer period of adult life. The State, if its own 
advantage be considered, has no option but to provide for the crippled 
child and give him, at any rate, a chance of leading an independent 
life. 
NOTE ON THE EDUCATION OF CRIPPLED CHILDREN IN NEW YORK CITY. 
One of the first steps toward the solving of the problem of the education of 
crippled children by the public schools of New York was made in 1906, when 
the board of education joined forces with two private guilds. The guilds had 
paved the way, and it was for the board of education to recognize the system 
and attempt some advance. 
The school equipment and teachers were supplied by the board of education ; 
the buildings, transportation, nourishment, and general public care were looked 
after by the guilds. 
This attempt was found successful and a further advance was made a year 
later, in 1907, when classes for crippled children were added to the regular 
public schools wherever rooms were available. 
At present there are 18 classes for crippled children in the public-school 
system of the city of New York, and more will be added as children are found. 
Children from 5 to 15 are now in attendance, coming at 9, bringing a noonday 
lunch, and returning at 2. The expense of the stage for the transportation of 
these children is borne by the board of education. 
The regularity of attendance, often 100 per cent, and the general progress 
made, both mentally and physically, justify beyond doubt the existence of these 
schools.

  CHAPTER XII. 
THE EDUCATIONAL REFORM IN CHINA. 
By JoHn Fryer, 
Professor of Oriental Languages and Literature, Special Commissioner for Investigation 
of Oriental Bducation, University of California. 
Introduction.—The recent educational reform in China is unique 
in the history of the world. No national transformation has ever 
occurred on so large a scale, in so sudden a manner, and fraught with 
such far-reaching consequences to the whole human race. 
Five years ago (in 1904), when visiting the scenes of my former 
labors in China, I found the country just beginning to recover from 
the humiliating effects of the Boxer outbreak. Educational affairs 
seemed to be at a standstill; but signs were not wanting that enormous 
changes were pending in the near future. What could be done to save 
the country from foreign domination was the paramount question 
that sadly perplexed the minds of the more thoughtful. It was ap- 
parently in vain that the Emperor had issued his renowned reform 
decrees bearing on the subject before the great coup d’état. The 
celebrated brochure of the sagacious statesman, Chang-chih-tung, 
and his elaborate scheme for organizing a new national education, 
were equally ignored by those in authority. The rulers of China 
were still groping in the dark. 
At length the full answer to the momentous question came like a 
sudden inspiration—a ray of light bursting through the clouds that 
had enveloped the nation for many long ages. For China to hold 
her own against foreign powers, she must manifestly imitate her 
neighbor, Japan, and adopt at once all the main features of western 
civilization. It was seen that all the arts of peace and war that had 
given strength to western nations depended upon special branches 
of education. Hence these special branches must be cultivated by 
China at any price—even at the sacrifice of her time-honored system 
of national instruction. In other words, the same curriculum of 
study that is found in western lands must be adopted in full by 
China. In the impact of the modern sciences and arts of the West 
against the ancient philosophical system of Confucius and of Laotse, 
the weaker must inevitably go to the wall. When once this idea was 
grasped, the Government and people alike grew to be desperately in

514 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
earnest for educational reform, and the new spirit spread like wildfire 
in all directions. 
A few months only served to establish the new order of things, 
which has since been struggling against difficulties to take the place 
of the old. The success has been phenomenal and beyond all expecta- 
tion. Schools, colleges, and universities have sprung up in every 
province, whether under the auspices of the Government, of mis- 
sionary boards, or of private individuals. In the spacious halls of 
many of the old Buddhist, Taoist, and Confucian temples schools 
are now to be found with busy scholars diligently studying the ele- 
ments of the English language or of the sciences, right in the very 
faces of the great gilded images of Buddha, of the goddess of mercy, 
of the god of war, or of the god of thunder. The old examination 
halls have been closed and dismantled. Thousands of young people 
have been sent to Japan or Europe or America for a thorough edu- 
cation. The “new learning,” as it is called, has now become a mania 
all over the Empire, and is the goal toward which the whole nation is 
pressing forward with all its newly awakened energy. 
To investigate the extent and value of this educational movement 
was the object of my journey to China last autumn (1908). I trav- 
eled thousands of miles to some of the greatest centers of learning. 
High officials interested in educational affairs were interviewed and 
the more important institutions of recent origin were visited. This 
was done unostentatiously and quietly, so as not to attract attention 
and not to give opportunity for special preparations to be made for 
my visit. Depending on my long residence in China, dating from 
1861, and my continual intercourse with officials and literati in their 
own spoken and written languages, I was able ‘to obtain comprehen- 
sive and, what I believe to be, correct views of the existing state of 
things, neither ignoring the good nor overlooking the bad features. 
These Views will now be unfolded for the information of all who take 
an interest in the future welfare of China. 
The real object of the reform.—This sudden change from obstruct- 
ing and despising western learning and civilization to a mania for 
acquiring them as rapidly as possible is undoubtedly an attempt to’ 
regain national freedom. The foreign yoke is felt to be more and 
more galling each year. If China is ever to be free she must be pre- 
pared to strike at once for freedom at all costs and risks. It is her 
last chance. The first step is to learn all that foreigners are willing 
to teach her. The next step is to use that new learning as a means 
to stop further foreign aggressions. This being effected, the third 
step is to compel foreigners to relinquish their hold and leave “ China 
for the Chinese.” From the new patriotic spirit which I have noticed 
in different parts of the Empire I am led to believe that “ freedom’s 
battle once begun” on these lines will undoubtedly continue to be
-P-A-G-E-527

fought until the object is achieved, though it may take many years. 
It is a significant fact that a strong element of militarism forms a 
prominent feature in almost every school I visited. This was dis- 
played in showy uniforms, military drill, instruction in the use of 
firearms, and in many other unmistakable ways. 
The Chinese classical literature will be retained—Although the 
old systems of competitive examination based upon writing formal 
essays on themes from the time-honored classics have been abolished 
by imperial decree, and the old forms of study are consequently 
almost neglected for the time being, yet the classics will have to 
form the backbone of Chinese literary education. Hence much valu- 
able instruction is still being carried on, though in a modified form, 
in schools of the old type under competent teachers, and especially 
in places remote from foreign intercourse. For centuries to come 
Chinese classical studies will be made the groundwork of all thorough 
Chinese education. There will be a reaction in this direction later 
on when the present craze for everything foreign has begun to sub- 
side a little. Traces of this reaction are already becoming manifest, 
for the Chinese can no more do without their classics than we could 
do without our Bible or Shakespeare. 
The need for a foreign director of education —Most of the real 
work of the new education that is now being carried on in China is 
either under the direction or under the auspices of qualified western 
teachers, and especially those that are found in missionary schools 
and colleges. The random attempts on the part of government 
officials and private individuals to establish and carry out a new 
system of education that shall, at one short step, pass over from the 
age of Confucius to that of modern western civilization are neces- 
sarily absurd and can only meet with failures as well as involve use- 
less expenditures of time and money. “New wine must not be put 
into old bottles.” From the president of the new board oi education 
downward there is a general ignorance of such requirements as cur- 
ricula, methods, systems, sequences, prescribed and elective work, and 
general control. This is not to be wondered at. The only way out 
of the difficulty seems to be the appointment of a highly qualified and 
trustworthy foreign educator at the head of the central board of 
education. He should be given a free hand to select the most suit- 
able men, whether Chinese or foreigners, as directors or assistants 
in each of the provincial boards. What Sir Robert Hart has been 
to the imperial maritime customs for nearly fifty years, such a foreign 
president would be to the government system of the new education 
in China. 
The frauds in educational affairs —Graft and peculation are not 
unknown in China. It is easily: seen that there is money to be made 
by fostering the new education. Government grants for such pur-
-P-A-G-E-528
    
516 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
poses seem to be too easily forthcoming, and too easily misappro- 
priated. Private individuals also start schools with high-sounding 
names, large fees, and small running expenses, but with only a min- 
imum amount of an inferior kind of education. The ignorant multi- 
tudes can not distinguish the wheat from the chaff. Hence there 
are to be found schools and colleges for the “ new learning ” in China 
that are little better than mere money-making devices and frauds. 
This fs likely to be the case for some time to come. There are, how- 
ever, many very praiseworthy exceptions which have come under my 
observation, and it is upon these that the advancement of education 
in China principally depends. 
The Chinese do not want charity—The Chinese are naturally a 
proud people and do not like the idea of charitable interference in 
their affairs by foreigners. Hence the establishment of large schools 
and colleges by western philanthropists and the conferring of for- 
eign degrees in China upon Chinese subjects is not likely to meet with 
much favor or popularity among the officials and higher classes. 
Pure philanthropy of this kind, without deep-laid sinister motives, 
is not intelligible to the average astute Chinese official who wants to 
see a reason for everything. He can only see a deep-laid political 
scheme behind all our gratuitous attempts to foreignize or denation- 
alize his countrymen by foreign education in foreign schools and 
colleges established nearly all over the Empire. 
The sending of students to foreign countries for education—The 
waiving of a portion of the Boxer indemnity fund by the Govern- 
ment of the United States appears to have made a profound im- 
pression upon the Chinese Government, while the suggestion that it 
should be applied to educational purposes has met with considerable 
approval. One hundred Chinese students have already been sent to 
America in response to this suggestion, and the same number are to 
go forward yearly for a certain number of years to be distributed 
among the various universities. This whole question of sending stu- 
dents to America and Europe to carry on their education has its 
many advantages and its corresponding disadvantages. Among the 
latter may be mentioned that such students often come back 
thoroughly Europeanized or Americanized and out of sympathy with 
the bulk of their comparatively ignorant fellow-countrymen, with 
whom they hardly care to associate. In fact these foreign-educated 
Chinese seem already to form a caste among themselves from which 
the bulk of the people, however good and worthy, are excluded. The 
masses of China are not to be educated by such means. It is good 
education near home, carried on in continual touch with relatives and 
friends, that is needed for the regeneration of China. In schools for 
Chinese girls and women, which are already very numerous, this 
consideration is of immense importance.
-P-A-G-E-529
  
THE EDUCATIONAL REFORM IN CHINA. 517 
Furthermore, the Chinese, like other races, prize most what costs 
them trouble to obtain. To be maintained and educated abroad with 
a liberal allowance for a number of years entirely at the government 
expense is not calculated to produce a body of self-reliant men de- 
pendent on their own honest exertions; and yet it is just such men 
that the Government stands most in need of at the present time. The 
best men now in the Chinese Government or civil service are mostly 
self-made men, who have risen from the middle or lower classes by 
sheer merit or diligence, rather than the sons of wealthy individuals 
or officials brought up in the lap of luxury. Yet it is this latter class, 
or the sons of well-to-do families, who have the chief political in- 
fluence necessary to obtain these gratuitous cadetships allowing them 
to go abroad at government expense. 
European languages versus Chinese as the medium of instruction.— 
As to the language that should be employed in imparting the new 
education, there can be no doubt in the minds of Chinese and for- 
eigners who are competent to express an opinion, that it should be 
Chinese. To expect the millions of Chinese people to learn sufficient 
of English or any other foreign language to be of any real educa- 
tional value beyond that of an accomplishment is as absurd as it 
is mischievous. A complete western education, which requires twenty 
years for foreigners to acquire, can hardly be obtained in less time 
.by a Chinese student handicapped by a new language, even if he 
neglects his Chinese studies altogether. For a Chinese to obtain a 
thorough Chinese education requires almost a similar amount of 
time. To try to crowd a double education into a few years, as is 
now being attempted, is to attempt an impossibility except in a few 
rare instances of precocity or extraordinary talents. To suppose 
that the Chinese language is incapable of expansion and of expressing 
all western ideas is to show great ignorance of the growth of the 
Chinese literature and of what has already been done in the way of 
translation and compilation from foreign sources. 
The compulsory religious teaching and worship in Christian schools 
- and colleges.—As previously stated, the best schools and colleges for 
the “new learning” are undoubtedly those under missionary aus- 
pices. In order to carry out the wishes of the subscribers in the 
home lands, Christian propagandism has naturally to be made the 
prominent feature in these excellent institutions. The study of 
Christian doctrines and dogmas, with participation in Christian wor- 
ship, have therefore to be made compulsory instead of optional, as 
I feel they ought to be. It is true that in China’s present emergency 
these establishments have recently experienced no difficulty in obtain- 
ing as many students, as they can teach, so eager are the people to 
get the “new learning” at any price or sacrifice of religious senti- 
ments; but from an educational point of view, as well as in the
-P-A-G-E-530
  518 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
interests of true Christianity, such compulsory requirements should 
be removed and all religious teaching or exercises made purely 
optional. It stands to reason that to use secular education as a bait 
to catch Christian converts is wrong in principle, however successful 
it may prove in practice for the time being. 
After nearly half a century of close observation of the results of 
this régime, I have ample grounds for this deliberate opinion, which 
has only been all the more strengthened during recent visits to sev- 
eral of the larger colleges. Among others may be mentioned the 
Canton Christian College, where I stayed two days, and was greatly 
pleased with all the secular work that is being carried on in spite . 
of great deficiency of funds and compulsory Christian teaching and 
worship. By withdrawing the propagandist requirements and 
charging much higher fees, at the same time asking the wealthy 
Chinese of the province for liberal contributions, I am sure the nec- 
essary funds for almost unlimited expansion of this college would 
easily be forthcoming, and the cause of Christianity would be 
strengthened and respected. In contrast with this establishment is 
the Imperial University at T’ai-ynan-foo, in the Shansi Province, 
where I spent a very pleasant week and was entertained by an old 
friend, President Soothill. The endowment of this government in- 
stitution is the indemnity fund for the local massacre of Christian 
missionaries during the Boxer outbreak. Here one of the require- 
ments is the formal ceremonial recognition once a month of Confucius 
as the great sage of China. But this, though expected from the 
students, is not enforced by the authorities, and thus becomes a 
purely voluntary act which Christian converts are excused from. 
The subjects of instruction in the “new learning” schools.—It is 
not to be wondered at that an acqaintance with foreign languages is 
the chief desire of the progressive, up-to-date Chinese student. It 
appears to him to be the key to all western knowledge and to the 
lucrative positions where such knowledge is necessary. Hence Eng- 
lish literature is not valued for the treasures it contains in itself, but 
only as a means for enabling the student to come into profitable con- 
tact with the people and civilization of the West. Anything beyond 
this does not seem as yet to appeal to the average Chinese mind. 
Next to English literature come the different branches of science 
and art, such as mathematics, physics, geography, history, political 
science, etc., the elements of which are taught in most of the pre- 
paratory schools. The central board of education in Peking and 
the provincial board of each province take the direction and over- 
sight of all the government educational affairs, arrange the curricula, 
and afford facilities wherever required. 
There are many colleges established by the Government in differ- 
ent parts of China for special subjects to suit modern demands, such
-P-A-G-E-531
  THE EDUCATIONAL REFORM IN CHINA. 519 
as agriculture, engineering in all its branches, pedagogy, medicine, 
military and naval science, jurisprudence, the principles of govern- 
ment, etc. I visited several of these, and although a few were very 
unsatisfactory, yet others showed most encouraging signs of progress 
and of future benefit to the nation. The most noteworthy were the 
technical and industrial schools where theory and practice were 
combined. At Tientsin and Tsinan, for instance, were excellent 
schools of this description to which I paid special attention. Handi- 
craftsmen are invited to come from the most remote towns and 
villages to learn the newest and most economical methods of carry- 
ing on various trades or art work by courses of actual practice. 
These, on returning to their homes, carry with them new methods 
and new ideas which necessarily must be highly beneficial. In the 
establishment at Tientsin I found no less than ten departments in 
active operation, with a large showroom and sales room where the 
various products could be examined and purchased or orders taken. 
In this way the school is to a certain extent rendered self-supporting. 
The departments of most interest to me were textile manufactures, 
pottery and earthenware, drawing, painting, carving and sculpture, 
lucifer matches, wood, iron, and metal work, electric apparatus, em- 
broidery, woolen rugs, matting, and scientific apparatus for ele- 
mentary educational purposes. . 
These schools of practical industry are laying a foundation for 
the future wealth and prosperity of the nation of far more real value 
than the military and naval science which are made to occupy 
the foreground in almost every picture of China’s progress in 
civilization. 
Schemes for the establishment of universities in China by for- 
eigners.—The idea is gaining ground among various benevolent 
western people who are interested in the welfare of China that the 
country requires large free universities to be established in different 
localities and run in the same way and upon the same lines as the 
universities in our own home lands. Schemes for several such uni- 
versities are now being discussed, and one or two of them seem to be 
in a state of preliminary organization. The wealthy philanthropists 
of Europe and America are certainly doing well in this respect as 
far as they understand the situation; but the means employed must 
not be such as to denationalize the Chinese or lead them to forsake 
the study of their own language and literature; because upon these 
the real education of the bulk of the nation must necessarily depend. 
Several generations of preparatory work are needed in the different 
grades before full-grown universities will become a necessity. To 
understand this it is only requisite to remember that a university for 
China must be essentially Chinese and conducted in the Chinese lan- 
guage, with foreign languages and foreign literature only as accom-
-P-A-G-E-532
520 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
plishments or for specific purposes, rather than as the main feature 
of the curriculum. The degrees conferred must of course be Chinese 
degrees, recognized and granted by the Imperial Government. Fur- 
thermore, it must not be forgotten that China has not yet a universal 
spoken language of her own in which oral instruction can be given. 
The need for unification of the spoken language is far greater than 
the need for commencing foreign universities. Attempts have been 
made by the Imperial Government in this direction by decrees order- 
ing that the teaching in all schools be conducted in the Mandarin 
language, which already obtains as the spoken language of fully one- 
half of the Empire; but this change will take many years to accom- 
plish. The only places where I found schools professing to teach 
the Mandarin language to those who speak other dialects were at the 
college at Nanking for students from Java and the Straits Settle- 
ments, and at Singapore and Penang in schools under Chinese con- 
sular direction, where only the southern dialects of China are usually 
spoken by the Chinese residents. 
The Chinese should endow their own universities—During my 
visit to Hongkong considerable interest was being manifested toward 
the establishment of an English university in that colony for the 
benefit of Chinese residents. One very sensible condition of the 
promised land and buildings was that a similar sum must be sub- 
scribed by local residents for a sufficient endowment. This sum did 
not appear to be forthcoming. Surely this is an excellent test as 
to the real need for such institutions. If the same method were 
applied to each of the different schemes for free foreign universities 
for China, it might save oversanguine promoters from having a 
“ white elephant ” upon their hands. 
The good work of the Chinese Young Men’s Christian Associa- 
tion —I am glad of this opportunity to testify as to the benefit which 
is being conferred on the Chinese educational movement by the dif- 
ferent branches of the Chinese Young Men’s Christian Association. 
As an instance, the Shanghai branch, which now numbers 1,000 mem- 
bers, has day and evening classes for a great variety of practical sub- 
jects of a secular character, taught by competent teachers. There is 
no compulsory attendance on religious teachings or worship what- 
ever. Associate members have only to be of good moral character, 
“paying a small annual subscription irrespective of creed or religious 
views. At Tientsin and other educational centers equal activity is 
being displayed, while the Christian character of the association and 
of its active membership is in no way being compromised. One inter- 
esting feature of this Chinese Young Men’s Christian Association 
work is the advising and aiding of Chinese students who wish to go 
to America to carry on their studies or to complete their education. 
A special committee in China and in America keeps in sympathetic
-P-A-G-E-533
THE EDUCATIONAL REFORM IN CHINA. 521 
touch with all such students until they are satisfactorily settled in 
American colleges or universities and have no need for further help. 
The dangerous pitfalls—I would remind all who are interested in 
forwarding the new education in China that there are many danger- 
ous pitfalls into which young China is very liable to stumble. The 
student of the “ new learning ”—and especially if educated in Amer- 
ica or Europe—is too apt to exaggerate the importance of his knowl- 
edge with regard to the lucrative and political benefits he thinks it 
ought to produce. He chafes at the checks and rebuffs which he 
is liable to receive at every turn from his own relatives and friends, 
as well as from government officials of the old school. He wants to 
rush matters and to create a new nation in a day, with a new govern- 
ment in which he, of course, shall be one of the most important per- 
sonages and enjoy one of the highest positions. The old ethical 
teachings of Confucius would have taught him the exercise of more 
meekness, patience, and perseverance. The deficiency in these quali- 
ties, together with a confused and inadequate knowledge of the real 
foundation of western civilization, are almost certain to lead him 
toward the pitfalls of anarchy and rebellion, ending in what may 
prove to be a frightful national collapse. The thoughtful among the 
Chinese of the old school, as well as a few of the more patriotic and 
discerning among the followers of the “ new learning,” are even now 
predicting some such catastrophe as the result of too much superficial 
western education without sufficient ballast or experience. Fortu- 
nately this evil has a tendency to right itself and every year ought to 
lessen the danger. 
Conelusions—T he outlook.—In conclusion I would remark that the 
result of my investigations convinces me that the educational position 
of China is full of hope and encouragement in spite of all drawbacks 
and disadvantages. It is easy to see that the ages of stagnation and 
slumber arising from long isolation are now passed, never more to 
return. Whatever may happen, the outcome will eventually be for 
the nation’s good. How far her statesmen will seek to preserve all 
that is best in her old system of education, her national characteris- 
tics, her wonderful genius, her manners and customs, her religious 
beliefs, and her form of government, is a problem time alone can 
solve. But there will be no relenting or turning back on the path of 
progress, however distant and difficult may be the goal, however many 
reactions may arise, and however severe the baptism of fire which 
she may have to pass through. 
May we not therefore very appropriately use the words of Tenny- 
son and say of Chinese education— 
Ring out the old, ring in the new; 
Ring out the false, ring in the true.

UNIVERSITY REFORM AT OXFORD. 
The discussion of university reform has been occupying the atten- 
tion of the educated world of England in recent years with a number 
of practical results. The investigations of the parliamentary com- 
mittee at Oxford in 1850 led to many recommendations of reform in 
the university economy, and other suggestions for reform in the 
courses of study have been made from time to time since then, with 
a view to bringing the university in accord with the changes of in- 
terests in the intellectual world. The scope and motive of the more 
recent calls for modifications in the management of the university 
and its studies, since the enlargement of the latter to admit modern 
science to a share in the university honors, are concisely brought out 
in the presentation of them by Lord Curzon, the chancellor of the 
university, under the title “ Principles and Methods of University 
Reform.” The chancellor is an earnest advocate of reform and care- 
fully digested the suggestions before him, to which he added his own 
recommendations and opinions. This work deals with a number of 
details of proposed reforms which, from their nature, can only be 
fully understood by those who are familiar with the history of the 
university and its relation to English society. There are two points, 
however, which are of. general interest outside of England, one relat- 
ing to the social influence of the university, while the other illus- 
trates, in a way, the conservatism of its Pea: in relation to the 
rivalry between the humanities and “ modern ” or practical studies. 
The first of the subjects referred to is the recent departure in ex- 
tending university Ls asia to the poorer classes, “the duty of 
Oxford to the poor,” as Lord Curzon phrases it, a duty which, he 
points out, should not make us forget the duty of Oxford to the 
523  
-P-A-G-E-536
  524 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
well-to-do and leisured classes—the so-called “ governing classes ”— 
members of which are called upon to take prominent parts in public 
life, and they are immeasurably better fitted to do so by the equip- 
ment and experience gained at Oxford. “It is as desirable,” he 
says, “that Oxford should educate the future country squire, or 
nobleman, or banker, or member of Parliament, or even the guards- 
man, as it is that it should sharpen the wits of the schoolmaster or 
cultivated artisan.” ‘This catholicity of view pervades Lord Curzon’s 
discussion of each proposed step in reform. 
The universality of the influence of the university, he maintains, 
must be preserved. The changed attitude of the working classes 
themselves toward the university is commented upon. “It is clear 
that for the first time since their appearance as a political force, and 
largely in consequence of it, many of the working classes are looking 
with eager eyes to Oxford to assist them in the task of preparation 
for their new and arduous responsibilities.” Their feeling toward 
the university is no longer one of hostility, but they are now begin- 
ning to turn toward it, and even if not all may have a full apprecia- 
tion of its beauty and romance, they yet “associate its name with a 
liberal and humane training which no modern or provincial univer- 
sity can give them.” “They are under no illusions as to their own 
shortcomings. The extension of the franchise, participation in local 
government, and the increasing influence of trade organizations have 
given them power, but power unaccompanied by knowledge. This 
knowledge, which an education arrested at the primary stage is un- 
able to furnish, can alone enable them to wield their power for the 
advantage of themselves and the nation.” Provision is made for the 
relief of the poor and others at Oxford in the noncollegiate system, 
which may be briefly described as a means of affording university in- 
struction to those who are not able or do not desire to live in col- 
leges. University extension also, by which is meant the classes and 
lectures established in the large industrial centers by the university 
with examinations directed from Oxford, has been of great assist- 
ance in providing instruction for persons of limited means or whose 
occupations prevent their attendance at a university. In this way 
Cambridge and Oxford have set an example in directly influencing 
the masses which has been followed elsewhere; for example, by uni- 
versities in Spain and France. 
The other point treated by Lord Curzon, which is of great interest 
to the intellectual world at large as being significant of a concession 
of scholastic requirements at Oxford to the modern demand for the 
practical, is the proposed suppression of compulsory Greek in the 
entrance examinations leading to the B. A. degree. The objections 
to retaining it, mentioned by Lord Curzon, are that it keeps out some 
of the best products of secondary schools where Greek is not taught,
-P-A-G-E-537
  
CURRENT TOPICS—FOREIGN. 525 
but which train their pupils for professional or business occupations. 
Students who propose to take degrees in mathematics and science 
are also deterred from entering Oxford by the barrier of compulsory 
Greek, and there is a growing public sentiment in favor of removing 
this barrier while leaving Greek optional, so that it would still re- 
tain an honored place in the university course. So far the attempts 
to modify the existing test have failed; a motion to make Greek op- 
tional for candidates in mathematics and science was defeated in 
congregation in 1904 by a vote of 200 to 164, But the question is by 
no means definitely settled, and among the proposals to satisfy the 
growing opposition is one which Lord Curzon himself favors, viz, 
the abolition of responsions altogether and the substitution therefor 
of a university entrance examination independent of those appointed 
by the several colleges. If this suggestion should be adopted, the 
question of compulsory Greek in their examinations would, it may 
be presumed, be settled by the colleges each for itself. 
TEACHERS’ TRAINING COLLEGES IN ENGLAND AND WALES IN 1907. 
BY W. A. BALDWIN, PRINCIPAL OF THE HYANNIS (MASS.) STATE NORMAL SCHOOL. 
To a Massachusetts normal school man coming for the first time 
into contact with these schools the following points stand out: 
1. They vary greatly in character. It is hard to find a basis for 
classification. 
2. There are no imperial state normal schools. Nearly all of them 
started as denominational institutions. : 
3. All. now receive imperial grants based upon the number of 
students. 
4. Because of these grants the Government claims the right to in- 
spect and to regulate entrance requirements, curriculum, and diploma 
requirements, 
5. The tendency is from denominational toward secular control, 
toward more imperial domination and more control by local or 
county council boards, even to the extent in many cases of giving 
over some of these schools to the county councils. 
6. The amount of practice teaching is only six weeks. 
7. A large majority of those coming into the training colleges 
have had experience as pupil teachers, though such experience is not 
now required. 
  
«The concession made regarding the entrance examination in Greek in case of the 
Rhodes scholars is explained on p. 208 of this volume. 
 
-P-A-G-E-538
  526 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
8. The curricula in comparison with those of the Massachusetts 
state normal schools contain (a) more literature, especially religious 
literature and word training; (0) less science, especially in hygiene 
and physiology; and (¢) less psychology. The movement is toward 
more science and more practical work. 
9. The work is more often presented in the lecture form than with 
us. The teachers are called lecturers. ‘ 
10. One person is designated the master of method, and to*him is 
delegated much of the professional work. : 
11. There is much more formality and less of simplicity than we 
have in our schools. Usually the grounds are surmounted by a high 
brick or stone wall. Often one finds a porter in uniform answering 
the bell. The lecturers are in university cap and gown. The faculty 
sit at lunch upon a raised dais above the students. The attitude of 
teachers and pupils toward the principal and of servants toward 
teachers and principal is much more deferential than with us. 
12. The men and women are, with few exceptions, in separate 
schools, and even when in the same school are taught in separate 
classes. 
13. Written examinations form the basis for entrance, promotion, 
and graduation. 
14. The imperial inspectors are very much in evidence, though the 
tendency is for these inspectors to become advisers rather than dic- 
tators. 
Having consulted with one high in the councils of the normal col- 
leges of England, I was advised to acquaint myself with five colleges 
which might serve as types of all others in England and Wales. 
These I will very briefly describe. 
ST. JOHN’S COLLEGE. 
The following quotations from the current prospectus of St. John’s 
College, of Battersea, London, will give some idea of this college as 
it is at present: 
The college is in connection with the national society, which contributes gen- 
erously to its maintenance and support. The buildings have been largely 
extended, and include modern and well-equipped laboratories for chemical and 
physical science. 
The college stands in its own grounds of some 5 acres, containing a large 
and well-fitted gymnasium, covered fives courts, tennis courts, a running track, 
and a practice ground for cricket and football; a match ground is rented at 
Raynes Park. There is a bicycle house for students’ cycles in the college 
grounds. A Morris tube range has been added for rifle practice. 
There is a students’ common room, and in connection therewith a library for 
lighter reading, paper and magazine clubs, ete. 
There is an excellent college library and museum, and a dark room for 
photography.
-P-A-G-E-539
CURRENT TOPICS—FOREIGN. 527 
The college has its own three-manual organ and music rooms. Facilities for 
practice are given to students of musical taste, on the recommendation of the 
music master. s 
Rules of admission.—Candidates for admission to this college must be con- 
firmed members of the Church of England, or be ready and desirous to be 
confirmed. 
They are allowed to present themselves for examinations, subject to the fol- 
lowing conditions, viz: 
That they (@) intend bona fide to adopt and follow the profession of teachers 
in elementary schools; (b) having been pupil teachers, have successfully com- 
pleted their apprenticeship; (¢) not having been pupil teachers, will be more 
than 18 years of age on August 1 in the year in which they are admitted to the 
college, 
Terms of admission.—Candidates selected for admission into the college (1) 
pay an entrance fee of £25. Of this sum a deposit of £5 is paid on the final 
acceptance of a candidate for admission; the balance of £20 is paid on entrance 
into the college in the September following the examination. No charge is 
made for board, lodging, washing, medical attendance, or education. Books 
(except net priced books) necessary for the prescribed course are sold to 
students at half the published price. (II) They are required by the board of 
education to enter upon a legal undertaking to serve for seven years in an 
approved school, or, in the event of failing to complete this obligation, to repay 
to the board a due proportion of the grant made on their behalf, calculated on 
the unexpired portion of the seven years. 
Main rules of the college.—1. Students rise at 6.30 a. m., the first lecture com- 
mencing at 7 a. m., and they retire to bed at 10.30 p. m. 
2. There are four meals in the course of the day, viz: Breakfast at 8 a. m., 
dinner at 12.53 p. m., tea at 6 p. m., and a light supper at 9.15 p. m. 
3. The students are required to spend a certain portion of each year for the 
purpose of learning the practical part of their profession in the schools used 
by the college for this purpose. 
4. Wednesdays, Saturdays, and saints’ days are half holidays, and the major 
portion of the other afternoons is set aside for recreation. Outside these hours 
students are not allowed to leave the college without special permission. On 
Sundays students are at liberty to leave the college after morning service and 
must return in time for evening service. 
Chapel services.—Divine service is held in the college chapel and is attended 
by all students daily at 9 a. m. and 10 p. m. The services on Sunday are at 
10.30 a. m. and 7 p. m. 
The holy communion is celebrated at 8 a. m. every Sunday; also on the first 
Sunday of the month at 10.30 a. m. 
The students are formed into a volunteer corps, as a distinct company of the 
Second (South) Middlesex V. R., officered by members of the college staff. 
Membership is optional; the expense is defrayed by the college. Company drill 
takes place regularly in the college grounds. 
The reader may see that much attention is given to athletics and military 
drill, which have entirely replaced the old-time gardening and other useful 
labor; that the denominational requirements are still in force, though contrary 
to the last act of Parliament; that the expenses to students are small; and that 
the regulations regarding service as teachers are rigid. : 
STOCKWELL COLLEGE. 
Stockwell College, like St. John’s, is in the thick of London. But, 
unlike St. John’s College, it is a school for girls, is undenominational,
-P-A-G-E-540
  
528 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
and is under the management of the British and Foreign School 
Society. 
This school receives young women from all parts of the kingdom 
for two years of residential work. I was pleasantly impressed with 
the character of the work, particularly in three directions: (1) The 
atmosphere of refinement; (2) opportunities for practical science 
teaching; and (3) the strong work in the practice school connected 
with the college. 
The curriculum at the Stockwell Training College consists*of the 
following: Scripture, two lessons weekly; English language, litera- 
ture and composition ; outline course on the structure of English lan- 
guage; arithmetic; algebra; geometry; physics, to be taken by some 
of the students; chemistry, to be taken by some of the students; 
botany, to be taken by some of the students; history and geography, 
drawing; singing and theory of music; needlework; the principles 
of teaching; reading and repetition; physical training; optional sub- 
jects—French, mathematics, education, hygiene, clay modeling, and 
wood carving. 
KING’S COLLEGE. 
King’s College (London University) has 54 men who are in the 
training classes. The arrangement here is similar to that at Oxford, 
Cambridge, Liverpool, and other universities. The students take the 
regular college courses with the other students, covering the same 
amount of academic work in the same time. Besides this academic 
work these Teachers’ College men are required to take considerable 
work in method, physical training, and teaching under criticism. 
Some of the advantages claimed for this plan are: (1) These stu- 
dents will be well trained on the academic side. (2) They will be 
associated with other students from widely different conditions and 
with different aspirations, and so will get broader views of life than 
if trained at local training colleges. 
ISLINGTON (LONDON) DAY COLLEGE. 
This school is one of the newer type of training colleges organized 
under the act of 1902 by the London County council. It is of course 
undenominational, though religious instruction is required. It is 
coeducational, though the men and women are instructed in separate 
classes. It is intended primarily for training the students, both men 
and women, of that part of London, and after a certain fixed time no 
applicants will be received from outside the city of London. 
I found this school in a modern, well-equipped brick building, with 
what seemed like an able staff of instructors. The school lacks ample 
grounds and a practice school, depending, as do all schools of this 
type, upon public city schools in the vicinity for practice.
-P-A-G-E-541
  
CURRENT TOPICS—FOREIGN. 529 
I was favorably impressed with the work which I saw in method, 
in science, and in physical training. The courses offered are: 
First year only: English language and literature as a definite 
study, history, geography, mathematics. 
Second year only: Principles of teaching, practice teaching. 
Both years: General elementary science (chemistry, physics, na- 
ture study, hygiene), art, French, English literature in connection 
with reading and recitation, vocal training, music, physical train- 
ing, fieedlework, manual training. 
THE LONDON DAY COLLEGE. 
This school represents the latest development in teachers’ training 
colleges. It is closely affiliated with London University, its prin- 
cipal, Prof. John Adams, being a full professor in the university, 
and its pupils being students of the same. A substantial building 
was completed in the spring of 1907. It is situated near the corner 
of High Holborn and Southampton streets, one of London’s busy 
traffic centers, and so in a noisy, dusty place. The building is a fine 
modern structure and is being well equipped, particularly as to 
laboratories and library. 
The purpose of the school is to train teachers for secondary schools, 
which means in England something between a high school and a pri- 
vate school for children ranging in age from 8 to 16 years. The 
students now attending this college are all carrying the academic 
work of the full college programme and take the professional work 
as extras. This professional work consists of physical training, edu- 
cation, and critic or model lessons. 
Those in authority are not satisfied with present arrangements. 
They hope that in the near future the training college students may 
be required to graduate from a three-year college course before 
coming to the training college, and then may devote all their time 
for one year to professional work. 
DENOMINATIONALISM AND PROGRESS. 
. The contention regarding religious instruction has, from the first, 
blocked progressive legislation. It has kept the training of teachers 
mainly in the hands of denominationalists, and out of the hands of 
the state and local secular organizations. As has been already noted, 
in the act of 1902 an attempt was made to regulate this matter. 
Similar attempts have since been made, until, in the official regula- 
tions for 1907, I find this paragraph: 
In no circumstances may the application of a candidate be rejected on the 
ground of religious faith or by reason of his refusal to undertake to attend 
9228—rp 1909—von 1——34
-P-A-G-E-542
  530 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
or abstain from attending any place of religious worship or instruction in 
religious subjects in the college or elsewhere; nor on the ground of social 
antecedents or the like. 
This regulation has met with serious opposition, and even with 
the refusal on the part of some denominational colleges to obey the 
regulation. Great efforts are being made to effect a compromise, and 
it is hoped that the education bill which is now before Parliament 
may solve this question in a manner satisfactory to all parties. 
TRAINING VERSUS ACADEMIC WORK. 
At first the preparation for teaching consisted entirely of practice 
under experienced teachers. Then some further academic work was 
required. Next, instruction in methods and more academic work 
was demanded. Gradually the practice work has diminished and the 
academic work has increased until in many schools the former has 
almost reached the vanishing point and the latter has dominated the 
situation. 
In the best schools an attempt is made to keep a proper balance 
between the amount of attention given to the practice work on the one 
hand and the academic work on the other. To keep such a balance 
is not an easy matter, particularly in the training departments of 
universities. The board of education have this to say regarding the 
matter: 
The board are greatly toncerned by the increasing difficulty of securing for 
students who take university courses adequate instruction and training for the 
main business of their profession. The pressure of their academical work is 
so heavy that such students are at present often excused from courses in phys- 
ical exercises and in manual training; their training in the art of teaching itself 
and other professional subjects is often lamentably inadequate, and it is impos- 
sible at present to impose on them the instruction in hygiene, which should form 
an essential part of the equipment of a teacher, and more especially for service 
in a public elementary school. 
The omissions are indefensible, and the conflict between professional and 
academical work seems to the board to call for more serious attention than it 
has hitherto received. 
In the universities there is a tendency to encourage those who 
desire to be teachers to take the same academic work as is taken by the 
other students and to get their professional work in between. It 
goes without saying that in a university in which the ordinary 
students are given all of the work which they can well do, one of 
two things must happen, the student who is preparing to teach must 
neglect the professional training or he must overwork to the detri- 
ment of his health. 
Then, too, under such conditions it is not possible to cultivate the 
right attitude toward the professional training. The subject side 
is continually emphasized. The way in which the human mind, 
 
-P-A-G-E-543
  
CURRENT TOPICS—FOREIGN. : 531 
and particularly the individual mind, develops receives. scant con- 
sideration. : 
It is evident to any intelligent student that the regular academic 
subjects are considered by the college authorities as vastly more 
important than are any strictly pedagogical subjects. The method 
used even in the presentation of pedagogical subjects is the lecture 
method. The instructor, therefore, does the thinking, while the stu- 
dents take notes which furnish the basis for examinations. 
While listening to lectures on the importance of pedagogical prin- 
ciples, these same principles are being violated in the student’s own 
case, and he is subconsciously drinking in a pedagogy the opposite 
of that which is being presented in the lectures. 
The tendency in all instruction is, always has been, and always 
must be, toward the domination of the book, the lecture, the authority 
of a dogma, a system, or an organization, the instructed being the 
recipient. Our universities naturally become strongholds for this 
type of instruction. University graduates are always in danger of 
making a fetish of such instruction, and it is not strange that they 
are demanding an increasing amount of it for those who are to be 
teachers. - 
The greatest work which the normal college has done has been 
along the opposite line, and as a reaction against such instruction. 
Following the lead of the great educational reformers it has put the 
little child into the midst, making much of his individual develop- 
ment. It has emphasized self-activity and self-realization. To these 
ends it has insisted upon the inductive method for the initial steps in 
all study, and upon the question and discussion form, as the typical 
one for recitation room work. 
In my opinion, if the normal college is to hold its place as a pro- 
fessional school, it must hold fast to this as its particular mission, 
not alone for the lower schools but for the universities themselves. 
It is true that there should be much and strong academic work in 
the training colleges, but this academic work should be done in 
_ accordance with the pedagogical principles that are being developed 
in the pedagogical department, otherwise we will have a house 
divided against itself. 
THE PRACTICE SCHOOLS. 
The arrangements for practice work are, in many cases, undergoing 
great readjustments. It is not, therefore, surprising that this part of 
the work is often very unsatisfactory. In times past, when all enter- 
ing students had served an apprenticeship of several years under 
strong teachers, the practice work was not so important, but now 
when an ever-increasing number of applicants are coming with little
-P-A-G-E-544
    
532 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
or no experience as teachers, the practice work becomes of the utmost 
importance. Happy are the schools which have ample practice 
departments in connection with their own grounds, and these liberally 
supplemented by opportunities for practice in public elementary 
schools near at hand. 
TRAINING OF STUDENTS ABROAD. 
The broad-minded policy of allowing selected students a third 
year of study abroad has proved somewhat disappointing in its 
results. The introduction to the regulations for 1907 has this to say 
on the matter: 
The conditions laid down for affording to selected students the privilege of a 
third year to be spent in a foreign country have hitherto been designed mainly 
for the purpose of extending to English teachers in public elementary schools 
a general knowledge of foreign methods of teaching and school organization, so 
that the schools in which they were ultimately to serve might profit by the 
information and suggestions so derived. Although in some cases students have 
undoubtedly made good use of the opportunities which they have enjoyed, the 
far more frequent failure of the regulations having this object in view, forced 
upon the board the necessity of reconsidering the whole question; and it was 
determined, as set forth in the regulations published last year,. to limit the 
privilege of a third year spent abroad to teachers who had already, by sub- 
stantial service in the schools, acquired the power to see in the foreign country 
the real points of interest and difference, and to apply their experiences in a 
practical and effective manner on their return to England. 
TRAINING COLLEGES IN 1907. 
The number of teachers’ training colleges in England and Wales 
in 1907 were as follows: 53 residential colleges with 6,225 students, 
and 23 day colleges with 3,541 students. Of the 53 residential col- 
leges, 33 were Church of England, 11 undenominational, 7 Roman 
Catholic, and 2 Wesleyan. 
CONCLUSION, 
In closing this brief report on the work of the training colleges 
of England and Wales I can not better indicate the spirit of hopeful- 
ness and progressiveness which pervades these schools than by quoting 
the closing remarks of the board of education, as found in the intro- 
duction to the regulations for the training of teachers. 
The board directly or through their inspectors will at all times afford the 
best assistance in their power to any college committee or teaching staff who 
seek advice with a view to increasing the usefulness of their college; and they 
will, on the other hand, give the fullest attention to any well-considered sug- 
gestions, whether for the improvement of the training-college system or for the 
treatment of the numerous problems yet to be solved in the training of teachers, 
which the collective or individual experience of training-college authorities 
may prompt. :

CURRENT TOPICS—FOREIGN. 533 
The influence of a body of thoroughly competent, zealous, and conscientious 
teachers in our public elementary schools may plainly be an immensely impor- 
tant factor in our national life; and apart from their professional work, the 
teachers as a body of well-educated men and women may render services out 
of all proportion to their number in the population in the performance of the 
common duties of citizenship. The importance to a nation of a thoroughly 
equipped and efficient system of training colleges is now fully admitted, and the 
board believe that the authorities of each training college will find no lack of 
public sympathy and encouragement in all their efforts to make the college of 
still greater public utility, whether by improving the quality of the formal 
instruction provided by the college, or by developing wisely those social actiy- 
ities which are not the least valuable element of college life, or by fostering 
all the influences which will lead students to form for their own guidance in 
after life a high conception of the duties of a teacher and of a citizen.?

AGRICULTURAL SCHOOLS IN CUBA. 
This office has received, through the Department of State, a trans- 
lation of an act of the Cuban legislature (approved by the President 
of Cuba July 10, 1909), creating six agricultural schools, to be estab- 
lished in the vicinity of the principal capitals of the island. The 
studies are to cover a course of two years, and will comprise, for the 
first year, applied arithmetic and drawing, applied elementary phys- 
ics and chemistry, elementary natural history, agriculture, agricul- 
tural hydraulics, farm practice. The studies for the second year are 
elementary practical zootechnics, practical plant analysis, elementary 
mining, rural mechanics and industries, practical agricultural 
analysis, accounting, and farm practice. The maintenance and in- 
struction of students will be gratuitous. They are to be appointed by 
the municipalities, and half of them must be sons of farmers. The 
schools will be under the supervision and inspection of the Depart- 
ment of Agriculture. 
EDUCATION IN GUATEMALA. 
The secretary of public instruction of Guatemala presented a 
report to the national legislature upon the condition of education in 
that state for the year 1909, from which the following notes are taken: 
From a brief sentence in the introduction to this report it is clear 
that the educational authorities of Guatemala are fully alive to the 
change in the spirit of education which has come about in Latin- 
American countries in the last few years, a notice of which appeared 
in the last report of this bureau. This sentence reads as follows: 
Notwithstanding the difficulties it has encountered our public education has 
proved satisfactory to the head of the state, who, with characteristic patriotism, 
has succeeded in impressing upon it the eminently practical character demandéd 
by the present times, and which is in accordance with the ideals of republican 
and democratic government. 
In reading this summary we are to keep in mind that Guatemala 
has a population of some 1,883,000, about 60 per cent of whom are 
Indians, most of the remainder being of mixed blood.

Primary education—There were 1,330 schools: belonging to this 
branch of instruction in operation in 1908, with an attendance of 
51,820. This was an increase over 1907 of 68 schools and 758 pupils. 
On February 15, 1909, the President of the Republic issued the fol- 
lowing order: 
Being desirous of enlarging the horizon of studies of our youth and recog- 
nizing the importance of modern languages as a medium of communication, 
especially to Guatemalans at the present time, in view of the completion of the 
interoceanic railway, it is ordered that the practical study of English be made 
obligatory in the primary schools from now on, and that applicants for teachers’ 
positions should be able to speak English and translate French correctly. 
In order to make this order effective a school of English was estab- 
lished in the National Central Institute for men at the capital which 
teachers of both sexes were required to attend. 
Secondary education —There are six institutions of secondary in- 
struction in Guatemala, their official titles being institutes and normal 
schools, with an attendance of 959 in 1908, of whom 94 were young 
women. The graduates of these institutions receive the degree of 
graduate in science and letters, of whom there were 28, or a teachers’ 
certificate, only 6 taking this certificate in 1908. The graduates in 
science and letters are prepared to enter the professional schools. 
An idea of the grade of studies in these secondary schools can be 
ebtained from that of the National Central Institute for young men 
at the capital. The course includes English, French, Spanish, geog- 
raphy (descriptive and physical), universal history and history of 
Central America, arithmetic, algebra, geometry and trigonometry, 
physiology, zoology, physics and mechanics, botany and mineralogy, 
grammar and rhetoric, shorthand, chemistry, civics, and economics. 
In the course of study of the central normal school for teachers and 
institute for natives, a course in methodology, theoretical and prac- 
tical, is added in order that the students may learn the methods of 
teaching and apply them in the annexed school of application. A 
chair of morals was established in this school besides one of agricul- 
ture and another of manual work.. Pedagogy and drawing are also 
among the subjects of study in these schools. 
There are seven practical schools in the capital and departmental 
capitals, four for young men and three for young women. In these 
schools are taught carpentry, tin and iron working, weaving, book- 
binding, and shoemaking, besides the usual secondary studies. 
The national commercial school at the capital had 144 students in 
1908. The course includes calligraphy, Spanish grammar, English, 
commercial arithmetic, bookkeeping, accounts and banking, commer- 
cial law, and commercial geography.

  5386 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
Higher education is represented in Guatemala by the schools or 
faculties of medicine and pharmacy and of law. In the former of 
these 129 students were entered in January, 1909, together with 6 
women attending the course of midwifery. Among the students were 
18 from Honduras, 11 from Nicaragua, 2 from Costa Rica, 1 Spaniard, 
and 8- Mexicans, the rest being Guatemalans. The report of the 
medical school for 1908 is largely taken up with an account of the 
Fifth Pan-American Medical Congress, which met at Guatemala in 
August of that year and was attended by delegates from all American 
countries. Many papers by physicians from all parts of the United 
States appear in the list of works presented to the congress. 
The law faculty or school was attended by 44 students in January, 
1909, who were divided among the five years of the course. There 
were also 3 students in the school for notaries. The course includes 
constitutional law; philosophy of law; civil, international, mercan- 
tile, and criminal law; the philosophy of history; forensic and liter- 
ary oratory and rhetoric; administrative law; judicial proceedings; 
and political economy. 
A periodical is published by the law faculty containing articles 
upon legal and kindred subjects, which exchanges with similar pub- 
lications in foreign countries. 
ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS OF VENEZUELA. 
Population (in 1907), 2,646,835. 
The Boletin de Estadistica, an official journal of the Venezuelan 
Government, in the number for November, 1908, published the fol- 
lowing statistics relating to the elementary schools of that country 
for the latter part of 1907: The total number of schools was 1,165, 
of which 586 were schools for boys, 459 for girls, and 120 were 
mixed. Out of this total, 161 were private schools—83 for boys, 46 
for girls, and 32 mixed. The schools were classified as national, 
federal, and municipal; the national numbering 702, the federal 112, 
and the municipal 190. The enrollment was 35,786, of which num- 
-ber, 19,480 were boys and 16,306 were girls. The private schools 
showed an enrollment of 3,442 (2,339 boys and 1,103 girls), or 
nearly one-tenth that of the public schools. The mean attendance is 
given as 25,982 in the public schools and 2,689 in the private schools, 
which would be 72.63 per cent and 78.12 per cent of the enrollment, 
respectively. As to age, there were 4,806 pupils under 7 years of age, 
13,578 were between 7 and 10, 9,621 were between 10 and 12, 5,882 
were between 12 and 14, while 1,899 were over 14.

PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION IN BRAZIL. 
[Reported by Vice and Deputy ee ae Joseph J. Slechta, Rio de Janeiro, Marq ‘2, 
1909.] 
The first attempt to give anything like detailed figures covering the 
general educational situation in Brazil has appeared in the recently 
published volume of the bureau of general statistics under the min- 
istry of industry, transportation, and public works. The data as to 
population is taken from estimates published by the same authority 
and is mainly deduced from calculations based on the census of 1900. 
The estimates are undoubtedly liberal, even from the point of view 
of the director of the bureau from which they issue. In a few of the 
States the number of schools and the figures for enrollment are not 
altogether complete, since it was impossible to secure complete returns 
from some of the rural districts, but in the main these figures may 
undoubtedly be regarded as giving an adequate idea of the present 
educational facilities in Brazil.

These figures include schools of both public and private character, 
the former including state; that is, rural as well as municipal schools. 
The total of primary schools includes 1,815 public municipal schools, 
7,089 public schools under state control and mostly in the smaller 
towns and villages, and 2,243 private schools, most of which are in 
the larger towns and cities. The state schools, improperly designated 
as rural schools, have a total enrollment of 348,327 and an attendance 
of 240,690; the public municipal schools have an enrollment of 106,754 
and a total attendance of 69,482. Private primary schools have a
-P-A-G-E-550
  
538 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
total enrollment of 110,841 and an attendance of 81,066. Of the total 
of 327 institutions of secondary education, 29 are public and 298 are 
private as to control, the former having an enrollment of 4,031 and 
the latter 26,258, no figures being available for the attendance in 
secondary schools. : 
Taking the total enrollment in primary and secondary schools as 
a liberal indication of the school population in Brazil, slightly less 
than 3 per cent of the total population of the Republic may be 
regarded as enjoying school privileges. Considering the fact of 
Brazil’s very high proportion of rural population as compared with 
the total population, this percentage of school population takes on 
added significance in view of the great lack of educational facilities 
outside of the cities and towns. In the case of the Federal District, 
for example, where the population is almost entirely urban, there is 
a population of 858,000 and a school enrollment of 61,933, while the 
State of Alagoas, with a population almost as great and with the 
exception of a few coast towns altogether rural, has a school enroll- 
ment of 14,092. The State of Pernambuco, with a population almost 
entirely rural, with the exception of the capital, Recife, has a school 
enrollment of 22,852, the total population being 1,310,000. 
THE DARWIN CELEBRATIONS AT CAMBRIDGE. 
The celebrations commemorating the centenary of the birth of 
Charles Darwin, and the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of the 
Origin of Species, were held in Cambridge June 22 to 24, inclusive. 
In addition to the brilliant social festivities, there was a presenta- 
tion of addresses by delegates of universities, colleges, academies, and 
learned societies; an exhibition of portraits, books, and other objects 
of interest in connection with Darwin in the library of Christ’s Col- 
lege, together with several important publications which afford last- 
ing souvenirs of the occasion. 
The following extracts from addresses of delegates, as published in 
Nature, illustrate the profound effect that Darwin’s work has exer- 
cised in the entire realm of science: 
Professor Hertwig (Kénigliche Preussische Akademie der Wissenschaften) re- 
ferred to the influence of Darwin’s work upon German biology, particularly at 
Jena. It was through Heckel, who hailed Darwinism with delight, and said 
that evolution was the key of man’s destiny, that the theory became predomi- 
nant in German science. It had been the starting point for all the researches 
of the younger men and had entered into the life of the German people. arlier 
this year festivals in commemoration of Darwin’s work were held in Hamburg, 
Munich, Frankfurt, and other towns in Germany. The celebration at Cam- 
bridge was the acme of these festivals, and would give an immense stimulus 
to the scientific work of the delegates privileged to be present at it. The influ-
-P-A-G-E-551
  
CURRENT TOPICS—FOREIGN. 539 
ence of Cambridge upon Darwin was great and beneficial, and particular men- 
tion must be made of the encouragement received from Henslow. Three bright 
stars had appeared in the scientific firmament of the university, the last being 
Darwin and the two others Harvey and Newton. 
Professor Metchnikoff (Institut Pasteur), in his address, referred to the debt 
which medical science owes to the theory of organic evolution founded by Dar- 
win. Diseases undergo evolution in accordance with the Darwinian law, and 
the recognition of this fact led to the science of comparative pathology. 
Sir Ray Lankester, K. C. B., F. R. S.—I think that the one thing about 
Charles Darwin which the large majority of British naturalists would wish to 
be to-day proclaimed, in the first place—with no doubtful or qualifying phrase— 
is that, in their judgment, after these fifty years of examination and testing, 
his “ theory of the origin of species by means of natural selection or the preser- 
vation of favored races in the struggle for life” remains whole and sound and 
convincing, in spite of the every attempt to upset it. 
In proposing a toast to the memory of Darwin, Mr. Balfour said: 
Charles Darwin’s performances have now become part of the common intel- 
lectual inheritance of every man of education wherever he lives or whatever his 
occupation or trade in life. To him we trace in the main the view which has 
affected not merely our ideas of the development of living organisms but our 
ideas upon politics, upon sociology, ideas which cover the whole domain of 
human terrestrial activity. He is the fount and origin, and he will stand for all 
time as the man who has made this great and, as I think, beneficent revolution 
in the mode in which educated men can see the history, not merely of their own 
institutions, not merely of their own race, but of everything which has that 
unexplained attribute of life, everything that lives on the surface of the globe 
or within the depths of the ocean. He is the Newton of this great department 
of human research, and to him we look, as we looked to Newton to measure 
out heavens or to weigh suns and their attendant planets. 
Mr. Balfour was followed by Professor Arrhenius (Nobelkommis- 
sion fiir Physik), who characterized Darwin’s contribution to the 
general progress of philosophical thought as follows: 
Evolutional ideas are as old as human civilization. We find traces of them 
in old Egyptian legends of the growth of mankind, in Hindu myths, as well as 
in the cosmogony of Herod and in Ovid’s Metamorphoses. During the lapse of 
centuries they were developed by philosophers and astronomers, that is, by the 
men of the oldest sciences; and in the eighteenth century, when most modern 
sciences took a distinct shape, those ideas formed important parts of the scien- 
tific work of Kant, and still more in the admirable theoretical speculations of 
Lamarck. But still the finalist school, founded on primitive and medieval con- 
siderations, was in the highest degree preponderant; and the leading biologist 
at the end of that century, Cuvier, had no conception of evolutionism. Even in 
Kant’s works we find the finalistic ideas prevailing. 
To accomplish the now prevailing evolutionary ideas a great work was neces- 
sary in order that these should be developed into a system embracing all the 
biological sciences with the strictest logic and severest criticism. The attempts 
made at the beginning of the nineteenth century by many scientific men, among 
whom the name of Charles Darwin’s grandfather, Erasmus Darwin, may be re- 
called, were far from sufficient. The epoch-making work was delivered by Charles 
Darwin, who, with an unrivaled patience and diligence as well as a rare impar- 
 
-P-A-G-E-552
  540 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
tiality during nearly thirty years, collected and sifted the enormous material 
upon which is based his masterly work “ The Origin of Species.” 
It must be said that the time was ripe for the triumph of the conception of 
evolution, as is clearly indicated by the simultaneous work of Wallace on 
biology and by the publication of Herbert Spencer’s philosophical investigations. 
Charles Darwin was also immediately followed by enthusiastic and prominent 
adherers, such as Huxley and Heckel, who propagated and worked out the new 
doctrines, 
This rapid success also caused a strong reaction from the side of the repre- 
sentatives of the old finalistic ideas, grown strong through centuries. The s 
battle fought between the two parties carried the new ideas into common life, 
far from the men of science and the philosophers’ study. During the last 
decade of his life Darwin had the good fortune to see his ideas brought to 
definite victory and generally accepted, not only in the vast domain of biology, 
which has been spoken of so eloquently this morning, but even by scientific men 
in general, and by the enlightened public opinion. * * * Nowadays there 
is hardly a science which has not been affected and in many cases thoroughly 
permeated by it. The sociological and statistical sciences now rest on an 
evolutional basis; history, and especially the history of culture, has found 
through it new lines of development; the linguist tries to find the natural laws 
of development of languages; the lawyer sees the legislative work of past 
generations and foresees their future modifications from the standpoint of evo- 
lution; the criminalist seeks the sources of crime in the influence of heredity 
and environment; and even the theologian, who for so long a time rejected the 
new ideas, finds now in them essential points of high ethical charm which he 
seeks to reconcile with true religion. 
The published souvenirs of this remarkable occasion are thus 
characterized by Nature: 
Darwin and Modern Science. Essays in Commemoration of the Centenary 
of the Birth of Charles Darwin and of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Publi- 
eation of the Origin of Species. Edited for the Cambridge Philosophical 
Society and the Syndics of the University Press by Prof. A. C. Seward, F. R. S. 
* * * 
Perhaps the most remarkable of the publications is the beautifully printed 
volume issued by the Cambridge University Press under the title of “The 
Foundations of the Origin of Species.” This contains the brief abstract of 
the theory of natural selection written by Charles Darwin in June, 1842, six- 
teen years before the famous meeting of the Linnean Society at which the 
theory was first made known to the scientific world. The MS. of 1842, which 
was afterwards expanded by its author into the essay of 1844, consists of 35 
pages written in pencil. It had been “hidden in a cupboard under the stairs, 
and only came to light in 1896, when the house at Down was vacated.” It was, 
as the editor says, evidently written rapidly, and is in Darwin’s most elliptical 
style, with much erasure and correction, the whole being ‘‘more like hasty 
memoranda of what was clear to himself than material for the convincing of 
others.” Mr. Francis Darwin has laid the scientific public under an immense 
obligation by his admirable introduction and notes and by the care he has 
taken that readers should be able to study the sketch exactly as it stood in 
is original form. * * * 
In addition to this work, a second volume, admirably printed by the Univer- 
sity Press, was put into the hands of the guests at the commemoration. This 
production, which is purchasable by the public at the price of 2 shillings and 6

pence, is entitled “ Order of the Proceedings at the Darwin Celebration held at 
Cambridge, June 22-24, 1909; with a Sketch of Darwin’s Life * * *.” 
The Rede lecture on “ Charles Darwin as Geologist,” delivered by Sir Archi- 
bald Geikie, K. C. B., on June 24, has been published also by the University 
Press, with notes, at the price of 2 shillings net. Reference was first made in 
the lecture to the early geological interests of Darwin and the formative influ- 
ence of Lyell upon his mind. The first volume of Lyell’s Principles of Geology 
was published early in 1830. Darwin took the book with him on his voyage in 
the Beagle and studied it, with a result that changed his opinions and began the 
lifelong indebtedness to Lyell which he so sincerely felt and never ceased to 
express. In four distinct departments Darwin enriched the science of geology 
with new material during the voyage of the Beagle. First, he added to our 
knowledge of the volcanic history of the globe. Secondly, he brought forward 
a body of striking evidence as to the upward and downward movements of the 
terrestrial crust, and drew from this evidence some of the most impressive 
deductions to be found in the whole range of geological literature. In the third 
place, he made important observations on the géology of South America; and, 
finally, he furnished new and interesting illustrations of the potent part taken 
by the denuding agents of nature in effecting the decay and disintegration of the 
Jand.? 
Among the delegates to this centenary upon whom the degree of 
doctor of science was conferred, honoris causa, were the following 
Americans: Jacques Loeb, professor of physiology in the University 
of California; Charles Doolittle Walcott, Secretary of the Smith- 
sonian Institution, Washington; and Edmund Beecher Wilson, pro- 
fessor of zoology in the Columbia University, New York. 
       
   TERCENTENARY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OVIEDO. 
   
  The University of Oviedo, in Spain, celebrated its tercentenary in 
September, 1908, and delegates were present from many other uni- 
versities both in Europe and America, in response to cordial invita- 
tions sent out early in the year. Perhaps more interesting to Ameri- 
‘can students than all the formal addresses by the delegates and 
acknowledgments by the university authorities, is a letter from the 
rector of the University of Oviedo to the rector of the University of 
Habana, which appeared in the Revista de la Facultad de Letras y 
Ciencias for January, 1909, a periodical published by that university, 
expressing his gratification in almost pathetic terms at the partici- 
pation of the University of Habana in the ceremonies at the old 
institution. He says: : 
                                       Many and great, and perhaps unmerited, have been the testimonials of regard 
and esteem which this university has just received on the occasion of its ter- 
centenary. It was flattered by the respect shown it by the North American 
universities, and cheered by the gallant cooperation of the French, while its 
pride was flattered by the presence of delegates from the aristocratic univer-

Sities of England; but none of these attentions aroused feelings in our hearts 
comparable to the deep, lively, and enthusiastic sentiment of affectionate regard 
which was excited by the presence of a delegate from the University of Habana, 
not only in ourselves at the university, but in all Spain—witness the warm 
greetings and applause which welcomed him everywhere. If the homage of 
Europe and Saxon America was most gratifying to us, that of beloved Cuba 
touched our hearts. Cuba, the first land of the new world which Spain caused 
to rise from an unknown sea, and the last which she lost, is for us a favorite 
daughter, never forgotten but always in our thoughts and always beloved. 
Therefore it is not strange that when so many distinguished universities were 
represented here, including the oldest in Europe, as the universities of Paris, 
Bologna, Oxford, and Cambridge, besides Harvard and Columbia in the United 
States, and Toulouse, Zurich, and many others, we saw and heard with most 
interest, and our heartiest applause went out to the delegate from the university 
which is our beloved daughter, another alma mater in Cuba. * * * Your 
university has a historical mission to fulfill, that of maintaining the language 
which Columbus brought to Cuba and of diffusing Spanish culture, a task in 
which we desire to give our assistance by sending to you when possible our 
professors, who will convey to you with their sonorous language of Castile the 
love of this old Spanish land, your mother, and especially of the Asturias, a 
region which has always been closely bound by ties of blood to the greater 
Antilles. And you will come here in return to teach us science and bring to us 
the breezes and the affection of the beloved isle. 
The report of his mission to Oviedo by the delegate from the 
University of Habana, Dr. Juan M. Dihigo, published in the same 
number of the Revista above referred to, affords material from which 
the following notes are taken. They indicate the important position 
the University of Oviedo occupies in the intellectual world of Spain 
and its activity in diffusing knowledge among the people. Doctor 
Dihigo mentions particularly the patriotic and meritorious work of 
the university, which ought to be seconded, he adds, by the other 
similar institutions of Spain in influencing the social life of the 
public whenever possible. This it accomplishes by means of school 
colonies; scientific excursions to the biological station at Santander, 
to study the methods there; and university extension, following the 
English example, and in some cases, according to the Oxford dele- 
gate, Mr. E. Armstrong, with better results than were experienced 
in England. The lectures of the learned Prof. Rafael Altamira of 
the university in the Atheneum of Madrid upon contemporary his- 
tory are especially mentioned as part of university extension work 
for their scope and influence. Doctor Dihigo speaks of the particular 
attentions paid the University of Habana through its delegate, he 
being assigned the principal place among the delegates from the 
universities of Oxford, Cambridge, Montpellier, Toulouse, the Sor- 
bonne, Montevideo, Harvard, and Columbia. 
The university, it appears, has been engaged in extension work 
for over seven years, the aim being not so much to provide courses of 
lectures, as to teach the uninstructed people directly, and so in part 
 
-P-A-G-E-555
  
CURRENT TOPICS—FOREIGN. 543 
supply the want which is expressed in the present cry in Spain, 
“fewer universities and more trade schools.” But the university, 
while yielding to this demand, by teaching arithmetic, drawing, 
geometry, etc., to classes in various towns, has also preserved its true 
function by raising the intellectual and moral level of the students 
of these practical subjects through a system of general culture. 
Doctor Dihigo makes particular mention of the practical school of 
legal and social studies, which he says is modeled upon German 
seminaries and the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes de Paris. 
The school is divided into three sections, one of politics and sociology, 
one of international questions, and the third of the history of law. 
After describing’ briefly the library of the university, with its 
rare books, and the architecture of ancient ecclesiastical buildings in 
the neighborhood, some of which are survivals from the fourteenth 
and even the twelfth century, all situated in the most charming of 
natural scenery, Doctor Dihigo sums up his impressions by quoting 
from M. Gaston Bonnier, delegate from the Sorbonne, who closed his 
description of the whole occasion as follows: 
Incomplete as the University of Oviedo appears in some respects, it is in 
reality one of the most active in Spain, being a center from whence intellectual 
influence is diffused, and while its field of education proper extends through the 
north of Spain, its influence makes itself felt throughout the whole country. 
In this anniversary of Oviedo may be seen an illustration of the general aspira- 
tion of the country toward intellectual renaissance. It is no longer the Spain 
of the fandango, the bull fight, and the castanet, but the Spain of the Iglesias, 
the Peredas, Pérez Galdés, Rusifiol y Quintero in letters, and of Ramén y Cajal, 
Bolivar, Menendez y Pelayo in science—the modern Spain, which is preparing 
to issue from its long-continued apparent obscurity to demand its proper position 
in the clear light of human progress. 
An abstract of an article by M. Georges Radet, published in the 
Revue Internationale de Enseignement for November 15, 1908, gives 
a sketchy account of the anniversary at Oviedo which supplements 
the foregoing. The founder of the university, this author begins, 
whose statue was unveiled at the tercentenary with fitting ceremonies, 
was Fernando Valdés, a prince of the church, an archbishop, and a 
grand inquisitor, and yet the university which was held at the bap- 
tismal font by one of the heirs of Torquemada has now become one 
of the most intelligent leaders in the advance guard of social progress. 
After describing in a few words the imposing mountain scenery of 
the Asturias, which, however, he says is marred by the intrusion of 
mines and smelters, a contrast which offends the sense of fitness of the 
spectator, as when, raising his eyes to the arches of the ancient 
basilica in the sacred gorge of Covadonga, he sees buckets of man- 
ganese ore carried high above the sacred edifice upon an endless cable, 
the author continues: 
The Asturian is at once, like his country, idealistic and practical. He seeks 
riches, but he knows how to make a good use of his wealth. Many Asturians  
-P-A-G-E-556
    
544 EDUCATION REPORT 1909. 
have become millionaires in Cuba and elsewhere and have endowed schools in 
their native villages, or museums and charitable institutions. Money is not 
everything for the Asturian. So with the Asturian University of Oviedo. It 
is also idealistic and practical and has added a labor of social reform to its 
intellectual mission. It has had great literary renown in the past and its 
graduates have held eminent places among the national masters of Spanish. 
Starting at Oviedo the university extension movement has successively included 
all the important centers of the Asturias, reaching as far even as Santander 
and Bilbao. It consists in public lectures, in popular courses for regularly 
matriculated auditors, and scientific excursions. It is designed principally for 
workmen and its efforts among them have been most fruitful. The expenses 
of this movement are met by voluntary contributions, and the treasury is never 
empty, and for two reasons. In the first place the promoters of this enterprise, 
the rector of the university and his colleagues, are not merely savants but 
apostles as well, disinterestedly devoted to their work and inspired by the faith 
which can remove mountains. Secondly, the University of Oviedo is a true 
regional plant with its roots in its native soil from which it derives its nourish- 
ment. Hence it rallies about it all the living forces of the country. It is the 
central link of a chain which extends from the grand seigneur to the humblest 
laborer or miner, or tradesman or soldier. It was therefore with legitimate 
pride that it called upon foreign universities to share in celebrating its anni- 
versary. Bordeaux responded with ardor to the invitation, and in the address 
of its delegate recalled that friendly relations had existed between the Asturias 
and La Guyenne since the earliest times. In the days of the Roman conquest 
the Aquitainians sought leaders among the mountains of the Asturias. This 
ancient alliance of the times of Cesar and Augustus has now to be renewed 
in a happier time and under intellectual instead of military auspices. 
ANNIVERSARIES OF THE UNIVERSITIES OF LEIPZIG AND GENEVA. 
The University of Leipzig, Germany, the only university in the 
Kingdom of Saxony, celebrated the five hundredth anniversary of its 
establishment in August, 1909. The occasion was a most interesting 
one, since Leipzig was one of the first German universities founded 
without the sanction of the Pope, and the second oldest institution of 
its kind on German soil. Its origin was due to the departure of 400 
German professors and students from Prague on December 4, 1409, 
where they had come into conflict with their Bohemian colleagues. 
The Prince Elector Moritz of Saxony acted as patron of the new 
institution. Leipzig is to-day the third of the 21 German universities 
in number of students, Berlin having 14,203 matriculated students, 
Munich 6,304, and Leipzig 4,630. 
A number of honorary degrees were bestowed upon learned men of 
Germany and foreign countries, Austria-Hungary receiving seven, the 
United States five. Ex-President Theodore Roosevelt was one of 
the five Americans, and the document conferring the degree charac- 
terizes him as follows: “ Ready for war, courageous, yet a promoter 
of peace; a man endowed with all statesmanlike qualities; an honor to 
the civic crown; one with ever-ready sympathy and understanding

of the German spirit—Ex-President of the United States, Theodore 
Roosevelt.” The other four Americans honored were Professor Wil- 
son, the biologist and Professor Burgess, the publicist, both of Colum- 
bia; Professor Michelson, the physicist, of Chicago; and Professor 
Loeb, the physiologist, of the University of California. 
The anniversary festivities lasted several days, and consisted, among 
other things, of a procession through the city of students and citizens 
dressed in costumes of the middle ages and later periods. Most re- 
nowned foreign universities had sent delegates to represent them at 
this memorable convocation. A committee of Americans who had 
studied at Leipzig had prepared a Latin address, and Prof. Williston 
Walker had been chosen to present it to the convocation. A memorial 
fund of $350, collected by these former American students of Leipzig, 
was utilized in sending to the library of the Leipzig University cer- 
tain back numbers of American scholarly journals. 
The University of Geneva, Switzerland, celebrated during the sum- 
mer of 1909 the three hundred and fiftieth anniversary of its estab- 
lishment, and also of the introduction of Protestantism under Calvin. 
The exact date of the establishment of this famous seat of learning 
was June 5, 1559. The celebration gave rise to a very extensive dis- 
cussion in the press of Calvin’s influence as a reformer and that of the 
institution he founded. 
EDUCATIONAL NOTES FROM CONSULAR REPORTS. 
[These notes from consular reports, together with the introductory remarks in each case, 
are reprinted from the publications of the Department of Commerce and Labor.] 
WOMEN IN GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 
Consul Thomas H. Norton, writing from Chemnitz, says that the 
question of admitting women to equal rights with men in the privi- 
leges of the German universities is still far from being generally 
settled. He adds: 
The universities in Saxony and in the southern part of the Empire—Bavaria, 
Baden, and Wurttemberg—have all opened their doors to female students, and 
granted them all academic rights, matriculation, graduation, etc. Others 
admit them only as visitors to lectures, but refuse to them all other privileges. 
The University of Berlin has adopted a compromise, refusing matriculation 
to women, but allowing them to attend courses of study as visitors, and also, 
with the approval of their instructors, to present themselves as candidates for 
the examinations leading to the doctor’s degree. 
During the past winter the 21 German universities enrolled 320 matriculated 
women and 2,504 female visitors. There was an increase over the preceding 
winter of 35 matriculates and of 399 visitors. The matriculates were divided 
among the 8 universities, where they are allowed entrance, as follows: Munich 
125, Heidelberg 65, Freiburg 53, Leipzig 36, Jena 20, Tiibingen 9, Wiirzburg 8, 
Erlangen 4,

546 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
EXPORTATION OF BOOKS AND MAGAZINES FROM GERMANY. 
Consul Robert J. Thompson, writing from Hanover, says that one 
of the highest evidences of a nation’s intellectual and ethical stand- 
ing among the people of the world is the foreign demand for its 
literature, for the results of its technical studies and scientific inves- 
tigations. In connection with this fact he adduces the following 
figures on the foreign book trade of Germany: 
While the German trade statistics in this particular respect are incomplete, 
nevertheless the estimate of 42,012,520 books sent by German publishers to 
foreign countries in 1907 is fairly figured out. 
The statistics show that 12,731,100 kilos (kilo = 2.2 pounds) were exported 
from the German market, 5,946,300 of which went to Austria-Hungary, 1,755,200 
to Switzerland, 1,055,700 to European Russia, 1,007,900 to the United States, 
639,600 to France, 527,500 to the Netherlands, 384,100 to England, 206,200 to 
Belgium, 204,400 to Sweden, 171,400 to Denmark, and 1,713 to Italy. To these 
figures 50 per cent more is added as having gone through the mails and included 
in the trade statistics mentioned. There was thus in all 19,096,650 kilos, or 
42,100,475 pounds, of books sent abroad. The valuation of this branch of Ger- 
man export is placed at 75,000,000 marks ($17,850,000), and the number of 
separate volumes, figured at an average of 1 pound each, at 42,100,475. 
GERMAN HYGIENIC PROGRESS. 
Yonsul-General Richard Guenther reports that a “Trade Hygienic 
Institute ” is to be established in Frankfort, where all matters apper- 
taining to the health and protection of German factory operatives 
and the working classes in general are to be studied and taught. He 
continues : 
This institution will be the first of its kind and will have a highly important 
mission and a great field in which to work. Frankfort has been chosen on 
account of its being in close proximity to some of the great chemical factories, 
technical high schools and universities, and the many economic and social- 
scientific associations abounding in this city and vicinity. The “Institute for 
Communal Advancement” in Frankfort, aided by contributions from prominent 
manufacturers, has raised 100,000 marks ($23,800) as an endowment for this 
“Trade Hygienic Institute.” 
All the data concerning experiments and experience of physicians and others 
employed or interested in the care for the working classes, also all reports 
emanating from official trade inspections, of labor associations, etc., is to be 
collected by this new institute, where they will be examined by experts and put 
to good use. Wxtensive laboratories fitted up with the best of modern appli- 
ances will be erected. This enterprise has its source in the belief held by its 
organization that a central point for this kind of science will greatly benefit the 
chemical and other industries, and especially the working classes connected 
therewith. 
NOVEL PLAN TO INSTRUCT GERMAN PEASANTRY. 
The following information concerning a free traveling country 
exposition now being introduced in Saxony is furnished by Consul 
Carl Bailey Hurst, of Plauen: 
A novel plan is now being put into execution in this particular district in 
Saxony to enable the peasantry living at a distance from the educational
-P-A-G-E-559
  
CURRENT TOPICS—FOREIGN. 547 
advantages of the cities to become acquainted with certain phases of modern 
art and literature. Due to the initiative of a citizen of Plauen, a free traveling 
exposition of moderate size has been organized, and several villages have been 
selected in which the exposition will be held, with the help, in particular, of the 
local clergy and public-school teachers. 
Books of interesting and elevating character, principally by German authors, 
cheaply and artistically printed, are displayed. There are also copies of very 
cheap editions that visitors may buy if they feel so inclined. Much attention 
is paid to books for children, and entertaining stories, popular biographies, 
and histories are offered at prices within reach of all, in the hope that they will 
take the place of detective stories and the like, which are found everywhere. 
The living room of the peasant’s home is rarely decorated with an artistic 
picture, and as such can now be bought in this country for a very low price in 
the form of colored prints of real merit, a section of the exposition is devoted 
to the display of attractive pictures of this class. 
LACE EXHIBITION. 
Included in the exposition is a collection of laces and embroideries. As is well 
known, this part of Saxony is largely engaged in the production of such articles. 
Many women and girls learn the different parts ®f the hand work on machine- 
made lace, and others devote themselves altogether to hand-made pillow laces. 
With this in view, the art school of this city has loaned to the exposition a 
representative line of artistic laces, showing various stitches that can be 
learned without great difficulty, even by inexperienced hands. Those who may 
wish to copy the stitches or designs can get the use of the different pieces. 
Also, several very old specimens of Saxon lace have been given provisionally 
by the local art school. 
Although this peculiar exposition of art and literature is just starting on 
its travels in the remote rural districts, sufficient interest has already been 
shown by the people for whom it is primarily designed to encourage the sup- 
porters of the philanthropic enterprise to further efforts. 
NUMBER OF STUDENTS IN EUROPEAN UNIVERSITIES. 
In stating that in 1907 there were in Europe 125 universities, 
which were visited by 228,732 students, Vice-Consul James L. A. 
Burrell, of Magdeburg, sends the following details: 
Of these the university at Berlin had the largest number of stu- 
dents, viz., 13,884; next came Paris with 12,985, Budapest with 6,551, 
and Vienna with 6,205. The list by country follows:

548 EDUCATION REPORT, 1909. 
GERMAN HIGH SCHOOL FOR CHINESE. 
According to the London and China Telegraph at a meeting in Berlin on 
December 4, 1908, of the executive committee of the German Colonial Society, 
under the presidency of Duke John Albert of Mecklenburg, Admiral von Tirpitz, 
secretary of the navy department, announced that the Government intended to 
establish at Kiaochow a high school for Chinese youth, at a cost of $150,000, 
with a recurrent expenditure of $37,000 per annum. The minister stated that 
the view prevailed in China that a thorough reform of the school system was a 
necessary preliminary to the modernization of the State’s methods of govern- 
ment. The Chinese Government had shown its sympathy with the project by 
expressing its readiness to support the new school, both by a subsidy and by the 
provision of suitable scholars, and also by admitting scholars from the German 
school to state examinations and to posts under the Chinese Government. 
The German Government, Admiral von Tirpitz added, desired to create a 
commercial high school as a basis for technical and medical schools and for 
institutes for political economy, forestry, and agriculture, to be founded later. 
COMPILATION OF A NEW TECHNICAL DICTIONARY. 
Consul-General Richard Guenther, of Frankfort, notes that at the 
annual meeting of the Astociation of German Engineers, lately held 
at Dresden, announcement was made that the great work of compiling 
and publishing the new technical dictionary, which was conducted 
under the auspices of the association, had to be stopped, because it was 
found that the expenses would amount to more than four times the 
estimates. Mr. Guenther adds: 
The great progress in science and industries had created a vast mass of new 
terms and matter largely in excess of what had been estimated at the beginning. 
This stoppage is to be greatly regretted, as the want of a new technical dic- 
tionary and encyclopedia is acutely felt by thousands of persons engaged in 
scientific research, in all lines of commerce and production, in literature, jour- 
nalism, and in the administration of state and municipal government. 
It is, however, satisfactory to note that the executive board of the Association 
of German Engineers has made strenuous efforts to take up and complete this 
valuable work, and has succeeded in obtaining therefor the aid of the Federal 
Government of Germany and of the Ministry of Education of the Prussian 
Kingdom, 
NATIONAL CHEMICAL LABORATORY PLANNED IN GERMANY. 
Consul-General Richard Guenther, of Frankfort, advises that an association 
has been formed in Germany for the purpose of establishing a national chemical 
laboratory. A fund of 1,000,000 marks ($238,000) is to be raised for erecting 
a suitable building with the requisite equipment. The board of directors of 
the association is requesting the Federal Government to support the new insti- 
tution by an annual subvention of 100,000 marks ($23,800). The state govern- 
ment of Prussia has tendered a site for the building free of cost. Germany 
being foremost among nations in chemical and medical science, the new labora- 
tory will no doubt become renowned and of great practical value, attracting 
students from all parts of the world,

ENCOURAGEMENT OF FAMILY GARDENING. 
Consul-General Richard Guenther reports that to encourage gardening among 
the working classes the city authorities of Frankfort leased at a very low rent 
small tracts of land belonging to the city. Altogether there are about 36 acres 
of municipal land let out for that purpose, divided among 258 different parties 
and to the association for promoting gardening on a small scale. Besides this, 
a tract of about 4 acres of municipal land has been let for the same purpose 
to the employees of the city’s tramways and electric works. The city will 
devote additional land for small gardening as the demand and utility for such 
will increase. These little gardens are a great source of contentment to the 
leaseholders and their women and children, who take much interest in working 
and planting therein. This system is also in vogue in Berlin and other German 
cities. . 
GERMAN STUDENT INSURANCE. 
Consul Herman L. Spahr ‘reports the University of Breslau has 
made a contract with an accident insurance company in Frankfort 
to insure its students on the following plan: 
All students of mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry or pharmacy, 
botany, zoology, mineralogy, and geology must pay a fee of 14 marks (36 cents) 
each semester and be insured against accident occurring in the line of duty. 
Firemen and machinists and employees of the clinics are also included, the 
first two paying 5 marks ($1.19) and the last 8 marks (71 cents) premium. 
The policy lapses so soon as the holder’s connection with the university is 
severed. The company pays 3,000 marks ($714) in case of death, 15,000 marks 
($3,570), payable in annuities, for total disability, correspondingly smaller 
amounts for partial disability, and 8 marks a day (not exceeding one year) if 
cured. This insurance is optional with students of the other branches and 
begins with the day on which they pay 14 marks for the semester,

EDITOR’S PREFACE, 
Tur present work belongs to the class of educational 
writings that deal with the art or practice of teaching. 
It treats of details of management. In our adopted 
classification, it falls in the fourth division, coming after 
(1) history of education, (2) criticisms and reforms, and 
(8) the theory or science of education. 
The art or practice of education of course presup- 
poses the theory of education, for it is the practical 
application of it. But while theory looks at the sub- 
ject in view of the full scope of all its possibilities, 
practice singles out only what is of present utility, and 
neglects the rest. Theory aims to get a wider and 
wider view, so as to grasp the subject in all its bearings, 
and contemplate the entire range of possibility; but 
practice, on the other hand, strives to narrow its field of 
view, and specialize its act of attention to the situation 
that is actually now before it. 
The two attitudes of mind are in this respect op- 
posed to each other. The theoretic shrinks from action, 
and defers it, wishing to keep the question open till all 
the possible phases of it have been inventoried. The 
5513
-P-A-G-E-8
  vi PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
practical attitude desires to close the question, and de 
cide at once in view of what is already known. 
Doubtless each of these tendencies is one-sided and 
incomplete, but each has advantages within its sphere. 
Few minds are nimble enough to move with ease from 
one tendency to the other. For the most part, the 
teacher who is theoretically inclined is lame in the re- 
gion of details of work; while the practically inclined 
grows narrow-minded, and incompetent to seize new 
truth. Goethe’s aphorism expresses this: “Thought 
expands, but lames; action narrows, but intensifies.” 
Again, if the theoretic mind undertakes a work on 
art or practice, it is apt to waste much energy and force 
in an attempt to be exhaustive, for it devotes space to 
considering remote possibilities at the expense of more 
thoroughness and pertinence in the treatment of those 
phases that concern the present situation. 
The best books on art and practice, therefore, come 
from those writers who decline to enter upon the ex- 
haustive consideration of their theme; for this would 
imply an undue expenditure of strength on remote and 
unimportant subjects. They select rather the most 
essential or the livest questions, and attack them with a 
zeal so intense that they move people to action. For 
action is induced by concentration of the mind on one 
phase of the subject. The equal contemplation of all 
phases neutralizes or “lames” action. 
That our author, Mr. Howland, has happily chosen 
the ten topies which he discusses in this volume with 
so eminent practical wisdom is evident from the fol- 
lowing mention of their general bearings. 
1. Moral training, treated in Chapter I, for example,
-P-A-G-E-9
  
EDITOR'S PREFACE. vii 
is the ever-recurring question on which hinges the whole 
business of the school. 
2. The character of the teacher, his permanent trend 
in whatever he does, is another hinge on which the 
value of his work turns. 
8. The memory—how much or how little it shall be 
trained in school-work, treated in Chapter III, is the 
most important question in educational psychology. 
Excess in memorizing produces a permanent effect on 
the character of the pupil, giving him a tendency to 
follow routine and to conform to custom, rendering him 
obedient to authority, and, in extreme cases, supersti- 
tious of precedent and utterly lacking in originality ; 
while neglect of memory and the cultivation of critical 
alertness produces bold, inquiring minds, and, in ex- 
treme cases, tending to impatience of all authority, hu- 
man and divine, and thus producing inclination toward 
revolution or even anarchy. 
4, Firmly convinced that the old education was in 
error in laying too much stress on the memory, the new 
education devotes itself to arousing the power of think- 
ing and independent judgment, and therefore lays the 
greatest stress on the methods of inciting self-activity in 
the child of the primary school. 
5. As a topic for his fifth chapter, Mr. Howland 
considers the ideal of scholarship, for this alone enables 
us to determine the limits proper for the conservative 
memory-culture as well as for the radical thought-cult- 
ure. 
6. The demeanor of the teacher is almost as impor- 
tant as his character, and this subject is treated by the 
author with eminent sagacity.
-P-A-G-E-10
  viii PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS, 
7. A study of the permanent effect of seemingly un- 
important actions or habits in confirming or neutraliz- 
ing good precepts renders the young teacher more cir- 
cumspect. 
8. The class recitation is the central agency of the 
teacher for regulating the mental habits of the child. 
By the questions and criticisms of the teacher, the pupil 
learns the defects of his own method of study. He sees 
also, in the recitations of his fellows, deficiencies in other 
directions than his own, and this experience makes him 
more alert in preparing the next lesson. The teacher 
thus by the aid of the recitation helps and strengthens 
each pupil’s mind through the work of all the others. 
The pupil gains new self-knowledge, and learns how to 
re-enforce his own perceptions and reflections by those 
of his fellows. 
9. Next, in the matter of supervision—the relation 
of the head teacher to his subordinates—the author 
shows how one should so direct and control as to 
produce more and more ability of self-control and wise 
directive power on the part of his assistants. 
10. Finally, the book is appropriately brought to a 
close with a chapter on the School Superintendent, 
whose work is to help each teacher by adding to his 
(or her) stock of knowledge and skill, the fruits of the 
experience of all the other teachers. The superintend- 
ent in his rounds of inspection finds devices which are 
used effectively by the teachers who have discovered 
them to overcome obstacles of one kind or another that 
are encountered in the discipline or instruction of the 
school. By calling attention to these he may aid this 
or that teacher who has not yet succeeded in mastering
-P-A-G-E-11
  EDITOR’S PREFACE, ix 
the situation in some one of these respects. The re- 
sult is improvement all along the line of methods of 
instruction, discipline, and management. The good 
superintendent continually works to the end that each 
teacher shall be aided by the best devices of method 
discovered by the entire corps of teachers; and by 
this he secures constant progress in the schools under 
his charge. 
The felicity of statement in many of these chapters 
will tempt the reader to turn often to passages like the 
following, wherein moral instruction is defined as not 
the inculeation of a moral philosophy, but the discipline 
under which pupils “acquire a power of self-control, a 
command of their affections, passions, and desires, with 
the intent and will to direct them to worthy ends”; 
or to such passages as this description of good order in 
the school-room: “Not that fixed and monotonous 
routine, enforced by the mere martinet in discipline, 
that deadens the vital force, stifles thought, quenches 
generous ambition, and, regarding more the outward 
form than the inner life, aims only at uniformity, though 
only of dullness and stupidity; but that quiet, uncon- 
scious harmony that results from each member moving 
undisturbed in his proper sphere, in willing conformity 
to an unfelt but all-controlling power; no rules for the 
sake of ruling, no friction or jarring of ill-adjusted 
parts—none of the pomp and circumstance of military 
display, but all moving on to the attainment of a desir- 
able end.” 
The fundamental conviction of the author is re- 
vealed in this definition of the true ideal of the new 
education :
-P-A-G-E-12
  x PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS, 
“We believe in the new education as we believe in 
a new tune, though it contains not a tone that was not 
in the old, despised one. We believe in it for the spirit 
of humanity underlying, overlying it, inspiring it, which 
makes the child its subject, its untiring study, its cease- 
less hope; for its truer appreciation of the child-nature 
in its restless eagerness, its longings, its love of nature 
and of life, and its ceaseless striving to acquaint itself 
with its powers, its capabilities, and its surroundings; 
and for the wiser presentation of subjects suited to each 
stage of its advance and development, skillfully guiding 
its unrepressed and gladsome activities into the fruit- 
ful paths of experience and wiser satisfactions, turning 
aside from the dreary waste of enforced drudgery into 
the fresh and flowery fields of earnest because curious 
effort; and we believe in it especially for the better 
understanding of things and their names, its nicer ob- 
servation of qualities and forms, its clearer conception 
of ideas, and its finer expression of thought.”

AUTHOR’S PREFACE. 
Tue several chapters of this volume comprise a 
series of papers read before the teachers of the public 
schools of Chicago and vicinity, and were prepared with 
no thought of publication, but solely to aid the teachers 
in their daily and hourly work in the interests of the 
children who throng our rooms. 
Though in no sense scientific treatises, they are the 
outgrowth of a large and varied experience and observa- 
tion in the school-room, and are based, it is believed, 
upon correct psychologic principles. 
It was their purpose to indicate the true purpose and 
spirit of the public school, the character and work of 
the teacher and her relations to her pupils, the proper 
sphere and duties of the principal, together with some 
suggestions as to the methods best suited to secure the 
desired end and make up the real life of the school. 
To rid our schools of the old dull, dead routine, and 
make them the living fountain of health, happiness, 
and growth, to which we no more shall see the school- 
boy “creeping like snail unwillingly,” but with ear- 
nest, thoughtful face, hasting as to a new discovery,
-P-A-G-E-14
  xi PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
has been the chief, the one aim of the author of these 
papers. . 
Though written for teachers of city graded schools, 
if of any interest or worth, the principles advanced and 
advocated are equally fitted for teachers of ungraded 
and country schools, and for any one interested in the 
welfare and usefulness of our schools in making happier 
men and women and more honest, public-spirited, and 
worthy citizens. 
The one great thing needed in our schools, public or 
private, is that spirit of humanity and culture which 
shall make their life healthful, happy, and progressive, 
the wellspring of an upright, true, cultured manhood 
and womanhood, and a willing, working, watchful, and 
faithful citizenship.

PRACTICAL HINTS FOR 
THE TEACHERS OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
1k 
MORAL TRAINING IN CITY SCHOOLS. 
THERE are currents and tides of thought, as well as 
of wind and wave—times when certain topics seize upon 
the public mind, and, whether we will or not, demand a 
hearing. 
The question of the claims and the usefulness of the 
higher schools is fast passing away with the hard times, 
in which it had its source, and from the ruins of fortune 
and reputation it is but natural that men, and thinking 
men, should turn to search for the springs of this wide- 
spread desolation. 
And if the decade following that of the rapid devel- 
opment of the high-school system in our land be that 
when, above all others, integrity is a myth and honor a 
by-word, is it not fair to dwell there for a little, and 
examine into the nature and workings of the system, 
whether there be a deadly taint in the very streams that 
supply our homes, our counting-rooms, our temples of 
justice, and from which we fill the baptismal fonts upon 
our altars? We need not, then, be surprised or dis- 
heartened, when from the occupant of the pulpit, or the 
platform, or the editor’s chair, come complainings, doubts, 
2
-P-A-G-E-18

and questionings as to the moral training of our public 
schools. We need not be offended, though many an hon- 
est and wondering citizen, listening, in ignorance of the 
cause, to their clamor, like Gilpin’s neighbors, thinking 
they carry weight, ery out, ‘‘ Well done!” to their un- 
guided and unrestrained career, but rather should we 
throw wide our gates to let them pass, glad by any means 
to learn the truth, and apply, if need be, a remedy. For 
in a land like ours, if the public school has any leave to 
be, it is from its being a sure and efficient helper in mak- 
ing intelligent, industrious, and upright citizens. 
It were easy to show, if such were the purpose of the 
hour, that much of the apparent dishonesty of the last 
few years—the unredeemed promise, the broken obliga- 
tion, the violated trust, the commercial and official degra- 
dation—was, in a manner, forced upon unwilling victims 
by the unyielding laws of value, as estimated by a worth- 
less measure—laws by which the enterprising, the public- 
spirited, the large-hearted, were not seldom the first and 
greatest sufferers, rudely awakened from their fevered 
dreams of uncoined wealth to the reality of want, hope- 
lessness, and dishonor. 
That the school, by the quickening of the intellect, 
and the inspiration of new hopes and higher aims, may 
have disturbed the rest and content of the lowly, we 
would not deny ; but rather claim, and glory in the belief, 
that every child of the school, if not of the soil, whether 
his inheritance be reached by the course of the National 
Academy or by the tow-path, is born to a birthright of 
progress and honor. 
The severest censure of our school system often comes 
from those who, in acknowledged ignorance of the schools 
of to-day, speak from the memories of their own experi- 
ence of a generation ago, seemingly all unconscious of
-P-A-G-E-19
  MORAL TRAINING IN CITY SCHOOLS. 38 
the fact that the school has kept fully abreast of the ad- 
vance in other departments of social and moral progress, 
of which their own charges, if rightfully regarded, would 
afford the most conclusive proof. 
A few weeks since, while riding with a friend through 
the suburbs of an Eastern city, we drew up our horses 
upon a height, from which, across an intervening valley, 
we had a full view of the busy town lying beneath a sum- 
mer sky, seemingly embowered by green groves, with 
their suggestion of soft lawns, cool shades, and sparkling 
fountains, and the sweet scent of fresh verdure, with 
here and there a white spire pointing through to the 
purer blue above, and with the outlying farms of thrifty 
orchards and fields of grass and grain almost rivaling 
Lamartine’s picture of Damascus. 
My friend said that an old citizen, long familiar with 
the dusty streets, on seeing a photograph taken from the 
same point a few days before, had remarked that the 
artist must have had a vivid imagination, as there was 
nothing of the kind there. 
So, as with a sort of filial tenderness we turn our 
thought to the old home and school of our early days, 
the green memory of some task or sport—some new book 
begun or old one finished, some hard problem solved, the 
snow fort, with the gallant assault or defense, the splen- 
did slide down the long hill-side, the brake booth by the 
road, or perhaps some sweet, childish friendship—seems 
to fill the whole field of view, and it is with a sigh of 
regret that we compare the present with the dear old 
days. 
But when from the old chest in the garret we bring 
forth a fragment of the old thumb-worn, dog-eared book, 
from which the cover, as we quickly recall, was torn in a 
physical contest of the master with one of the big boys,
-P-A-G-E-20
4 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
and turn the leaves traced with our frequent autograph, 
the pictures colored with poplar-buds, or the anther of 
the lily, or, as we turn to the master’s copy, from which 
we learned to write, we can more justly fill up the pict- 
ure ; and, though we may smile at the awkward figures 
with their grotesque surroundings, we can but feel that 
the childhood of to-day finds itself in the school-room 
upon a higher moral plane and subjected to better meth- 
ods and kindlier influences. 
In judging of the moral character and influence of 
our schools, we are happily freed from the perplexing 
questions that divide the different schools of philosophy 
and embroil the metaphysician and the scientist. The 
cunningly devised theories of the origin of our ideas of 
right and wrong—whether an original endowment or a 
gradual development—we can safely leave to those who 
are preparing a system of ethics or moral philosophy. 
But it may not be amiss to remember that the origi- 
nal of the word “‘ moral” indicates a custom, a habit, 
pointing us not so much to our philosophic belief as to 
the conduct of life. And itis for us to inquire, not whether 
we teach our pupils the views of this or that school, but 
whether they do acquire a power of self-control, 2 com- 
mand of their affections, passions, and desires, with the 
intent and will to direct them to worthy ends; whether, 
with a true and honest purpose, they go forth from our 
doors with a greater abhorrence of what is low and base, 
more faithful to the right, more sensitive to the breath 
of merited blame ; whether, in regard for all that is en- 
nobling, in courtesy to their equals, in respect for their 
superiors, they leave us better than they came, or rather, 
I would say, with a truer respect for the rights of all, 
even their inferiors. For to his superiors the boy, ter- 
rible as he is, is respectful—not to his superiors in posi-
-P-A-G-E-21
  MORAL TRAINING IN CITY SCHOOLS. 5 
tion, in acquirements, in age, but in the essentials of true 
manhood or womanhood. 
And the keen sagacity, the almost intuitive facility 
and accuracy with which a class of boys or girls will de- 
termine the quality and fix the position of a new teacher, 
might well put to the blush our examining committees 
and superintendents, with their nice balancings of merits 
and demerits, and summings of averages. 
Nor are we to judge of our schools by now and then 
an exceptional case. ‘‘There is no flock, however 
watched and tended,” of which we are always sure, 
though the committee of the National Association in 
July report no graduate of a high-school yet found in jail. 
The school is not the only force working within and 
upon the pupil during the school age. Even with the 
most punctual and regular in attendance not more than 
a fourth of the waking hours are passed under the teach- 
er’s care. And who can tell the home influences of many 
of them, their associates upon the street, the exhalations 
from doorway, and basement, and window ? 
Faithful and efficient as the teacher may be, there are 
influences and examples stronger than his and more con- 
stant and enduring. ‘‘ Let me make the ballads of a 
people,” says some one; but with how much more truth 
might it be said, Give me the first six years, and send to 
what school you will! The question of submission or 
lawlessness, of truthfulness or falsehood, of deceit or 
honesty, is decided, we believe, for most children, before 
they are supposed capable of understanding it. : 
Not from the school, but in the home, do children 
learn their first lesson. In their own neighborhoods are 
they taught to look for wealth without work, for profit 
without capital, and honors without honesty. Teach 
contentment and industry to the toiler and the needy,
-P-A-G-E-22
  6 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
with the palace home or storied warehouse of their mates 
rising before their gaze, the fruit of some bold venture or 
fortunate speculation? Not till disappointment has 
deadened hope, and suffering numbed ambition, will they 
accept the lesson. . . . 
Nowhere, as in the well-directed schodl, is the spirit 
developed that regards character above surroundings, 
where merit is rewarded with success, and honor bestowed 
where it is due; and never, we believe, have our schools 
had a healthier influence, never made more earnest and 
successful endeavor for uprightness of purpose, or been 
surrounded or pervaded by a purer or more life-giving 
atmosphere. 
In their very constitution are found the most efficient 
means for inducing a well-ordered life. If order is 
Heaven’s first law, it must be the first and abiding rule of 
the school ; not that fixed and monotonous routine en- 
forced by the mere martinet in discipline, that deadens 
the vital force, stifles thought, quenches generous ambi- 
tion, and, regarding more the outward form than the 
inner life, aims only at uniformity, though only of dull- 
ness and stupidity, but that quiet, unconscious harmony 
that results from each member moving undisturbed in his 
proper sphere, in willing conformity to an unfelt but all- 
controlling power; no rules for the sake of ruling, no 
friction or jarring of ill-adjusted parts, none of the pomp 
and circumstance of military display, but all moving on 
to the attainment of a desirable end. 
We may all recall such instances, as far removed from 
the hushed stillness and bated breath of the one extreme, 
as from the restless, noisy turbulence of the other—an 
order which of itself is ‘able almost to change the stamp 
of nature,” and is no insignificant factor in forming the 
character of a peaceful, law-abiding citizen.
-P-A-G-E-23

But the most harmonious order, pleasing though it be, 
is of itself but a passive, fruitless virtue—but the casket 
whose golden ornaments and satin lining furnish no suffi- 
cient reason for its being, till the jewels are placed within 
—but the well-founded structure, where the whirring 
wheels of a busy industry are still to be put in motion. 
And from the initiation of the inchoate man or woman 
of presumably six years into all the mysterious possibili- 
ties of slate and pencil, through the little round of pre- 
requisites of a high-school diploma, the pupils of a wisely 
planned school are learning lessons of patient, persevering 
industry. Despite the idle charges often made, it is not 
from our school-rooms that the lounging squads of the 
saloons are recruited, or the street-corners replenished. 
A search for the graduates of our high and grammar 
schools would lead us through the stores, the workshops, 
the counting-rooms, and the public or private offices of 
our city—to the records of boards of education, or into 
many a cultivated, happy home. And in this day of in- 
vention who can blame them, if, instead of finding our 
sons delving in the dirt amid the horny-handed laborers, 
we see them, with upright form and comely attire, with 
steam and electricity to do their bidding, guiding and 
controlling a broader industry and higher interests ? 
If a habit of intelligent and productive industry be 
not the parent of moral virtues, it is, at least, their foster- 
mother and most approved nurse. 
And surely it can not be that the intellectual culture 
of the school, small and imperfect as it is, the history of 
the past, the rise and fall of individuals and nations, with 
the open or more hidden causes, the unbarring the gates 
of science and pointing them to the boundless and rich 
fields beyond, the unsealing of the wisest thought and the 
truest sentiment of the deepest thinkers and divinest
-P-A-G-E-24
  8 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
poets of the ages—it surely can not be that all this is de- 
void of meaning for the moralist. We sometimes tire of 
listening to the dangers of intellectual without moral 
education. The performing horse and trained dog may, 
perhaps, feel no special stirring of their moral nature, but 
we are not made up of two so distinct natures, that, 
farther apart than the Siamese twins, the one can be 
wrought upon, and the other feel no sympathetic throb. 
The child may, indeed, be taught to lie and steal, but 
that is not what we mean by mental discipline and in- 
tellectual culture. It is rather a maiming and torturing 
of the spirit. As well might we call the foot-bandaging 
of the Chinese an athletic exercise, and Simeon Stylites a 
gymnast ; yes, and the warped and shrunken starveling, 
or the phenomenal and gormandizing Tanner, a professor 
of gastronomy. 
No ; the order, the industry, and the culture of our 
schools, though indirect, and often unconscious, are yet 
efficient and ever-present moral influences, which we can 
not well overestimate. 
Nor is the school wanting in that more direct and 
positive teaching and guidance that promote and estab- 
lish a well-ordered life and character ; not always or most 
frequently given in the set phrase of formal discourse and. 
threadbare homily. It was not by permission, but by an 
undoubted inspiration, that Paul spoke of the ‘‘ foolish- 
ness of preaching.” Though made the means of “saving 
those that believe,” the trouble is that the school-boy does 
not believe—in preaching, or in the teacher that preaches. 
Well do I recall one such in my school life, who set 
apart his regular half-hour for so-called moral instruc- 
tion ; and if there was a half-hour in the day in which he 
wasted words, squandered the esteem, forfeited the re- 
spect, and lost the control of his pupils, it was that same 
 
-P-A-G-E-25

moral half-hour. It was the appointed time for restless- 
ness, inattention, and disorder, when the exhausted pa- 
tience of his hearers found relief in whispered if not in 
muttered complaint, from which a wiser man might have 
learned that it is not all of morals to moralize. 
Noble as are the unquestioned motives of those who 
would introduce a text-book of morals for a half-hour of 
each day, we can but feel that, beneath the tender memo- 
ries of their young days, a closer search would somewhere 
reveal an hour made irksome and unprofitable by that 
bane of a bright boy’s life—a moral lecture. 
The good old days of our fathers and mothers, when 
the pastor appropriated the last half-day of each week to 
instruction in the catechism, was not far back of the time 
of Deacon Giles’s famous distillery ; and when the prac- 
tice passed away, it was no exception to the law of the 
survival of the fittest. And even in the reading of the 
Scripture it is by no means certain that within the sol- 
emn coyers may not lie concealed a leaf of Czsar or Le- 
gendre. 
The trouble with the dishonest and the vicious is not 
so often their ignorance of the true and the right, as their 
failure, through neglect or evil example, to have formed 
those habits of thought and action which constitute a 
well-ordered, a self-controlled, a moral character and life. 
That we have attained the limit of moral excellence, 
or are doing all that can be expected, we do not believe, 
and certainly do not hope. It has been said that, when 
any work is completed, all real interest begins to abate. 
It is only in the progress, the pursuit, that the earnest 
zeal, the ardor, or the deep interest is aroused and held 
fast. 
But it is not to the stated lecture, or the carefully de- 
vised manual, that we would most securely trust for im-

provement. Our memory and experience point rather to 
the quiet suggestion, the fitly chosen word, the interested 
inquiry, the look, the unfeigned sympathy, the favored 
opportunity, the firm but calm decision of the loved and 
loving teacher. 
First, and best of all, would we look to the personal 
character and example of the true, the large-hearted, 
right-minded man or woman. 
Perhaps I can not better express my thought than as 
I have elsewhere written, of this personal influence, which 
is the test and the crowning excellence of the true teacher 
—an influence unseen, perhaps, and unobtrusive, but all- 
pervading ; free from the slightest taint of distrust or sus- 
picion, but checking insubordination before the thought 
of it has taken form ; exacting a faithful performance of 
duties, yet encouraging by its inspiration before despond- 
ency has attained a conscious existence ; soft and gentle 
as a mother’s hand on the brow of a sick child, yet hold- 
ing the reins of authority, and controlling the very mo- 
tives of action, like the hand of Fate. 
For the due and full exertion of this influence we need 
to realize that, as teachers, we are engaged in the forma- 
tion and development of character, into the warp or woof 
of which all the habits thoughtlessly formed, the modes 
of feeling, the pupils’ deportment toward their teachers 
or toward each other, the kindly way or the uncouth man- 
ner, the listlessness or attention, the polite address or the 
unseemly reply, are all daily and hourly inwrought in per- 
manent outline and unfading colors. 
As compared with the life-giving, soul-saving influ- 
ence of such a teacher, what were the dull routine of a 
daily half-hour of blundering monotony over the cold and 
dismal abstractions of some closet-conned and primer- 
planned system of morals ?
-P-A-G-E-27
  MORAL TRAINING IN CITY SCHOOLS. 11 
Bishop Huntington, in 1880, spoke, with eloquent 
words of censure, of parents consulting the wishes of their 
children, whose wishes and choice they should themselves 
control ; but such a personal influence as I have indi- 
cated, like the breath of heaven, penetrates the soft text- 
ure of the child’s nature, quickening and shaping the very 
promptings of desire. 
We can conceive no more sacred duty, or one which, 
with an eye to the public weal, should be performed with 
more wisdom and care, free from bias or prejudice, than 
that of choosing the teachers of our public schools. Suit- 
able means and appliances are desirable ; books for study 
and reference, worthy of our most intelligent regard ; but 
we may safely leave all this to chance, or the whim of the 
hour, if sure in the choice of the intelligent, cultivated, 
and worthy teacher, of generous, sympathizing character, 
as essential to the mental and moral growth of his pupils 
as are good light and pure air to their bodily health. 
What a parody on the highest of callings, the reasons daily 
urged for engaging in it!—a sick husband, brother, or 
child ; my mother a widow ; my wages insufficient ; have 
been unfortunate in business ; I should be benefited by a 
change; want an opportunity to review my studies ; need 
rest before engaging in my profession ; think I should like 
Chicago—in all the endless variety into which these types 
may be developed. 
Thankful may we be that from the ranks of ‘ih weary, 
the needy, the changeling, the improvident, the unfortu- 
nate, so few of the unworthy have found a refuge in our 
school-rooms. 
In the management and discipline of the school, not- 
withstanding the doubts and forebodings of individuals, 
and notwithstanding the example and protests of our wise 
Eastern brethren, we believe that the prohibition of cor- 
 
-P-A-G-E-28
  12 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
poral punishment is a real forward step in the moral 
training of our schools. It may be questioned whether 
such chastisement is ever inflicted by the thoughtful 
teacher, or parent, without an after-sentiment of regret 
or shame, from the feeling that, after all, it was but a 
victory of brute force, simply because he was the stronger, 
and must have ended in the same way even if the child 
had been in the right. ‘‘ Do you know why I whip you ?” 
asked a fond father of his little son. ‘‘ Yes, sir, because 
you are the biggest.” And not unfrequently there is a 
rude awakening, on one or both sides, of the mere animal 
nature, insensible alike to the claims of right or reason. 
But cut off from this ready resort, the difficulty of the 
situation often necessitates a timely delay and a more 
careful examination, a study of the child’s character and 
needs, resulting in a calmer and juster decision and treat- 
ment, and certainly leaves the teacher less open to the 
suspicion of angry or revengeful motives. A suggestion 
need not always be given in the form of a reproof, and in 
cases of deserved censure it will be found, in most in- 
stances, more wholesome if administered in private. A 
spirited boy of ten or fifteen, called up for rebuke in the 
presence of his mates, all watching with eager interest, 
and to whose opinion of his brave and manly bearing he 
is keenly alive, and the same boy listening to the quiet, 
earnest, and kindly words of his teacher, with none of his 
companions near, or knowing of the interview, are two 
very different characters, in whose judgment the réle of 
the teacher, too, is greatly changed. What in the one 
case was the harsh, unfeeling censor, to whom concession 
savored of cowardice, is, in the other, the feeling and 
judicious friend. 
Nor is it always the pupil most familiar with the rules 
of kindness and courtesy at home who most readily re-
-P-A-G-E-29
  MORAL TRAINING IN CITY SCHOOLS. 13 
sponds to the voice of reason. And among the sweetest, 
the most genuine pleasures of these later years, I count 
the thanks, sometimes mingled with regrets, of the 
troublous, bothersome boys of old. 
And of the eight or ten whom I would recall as the 
phenomenally bad boys of school, I do not know of one 
who is not to-day a useful and respected citizen, though 
some of them drew upon our stock of patience and for- 
bearance to the very verge of bankruptcy. 
There are those, I am aware, to whom all this is a 
dead language ; who, at the suggestion of kindness, un- 
derstand weakness, and for politeness imagine only a 
sickly sentimentality, ever ready with the reply that they 
could be easy, as well as any one, in not correcting faults, 
or insisting upon good lessons, their very excuses showing 
an utter want of apprehension of what is intended. I 
would abate no jot of any healthful requirement, but only 
ask for a prompter because a willing obedience; and 
more thorough preparation, because a work of the heart 
as well as the head. 
A command may be in order in the prison or the bar- 
racks, but in the school, as in the family, never, except 
asakind of punishment. At the stern order to “ take 
my hand out of my pocket,” what a strange yearning ran 
tingling down to the very ends of my fingers, till the 
blood seemed to settle under the nails—an inextinguish- 
able yearning for the bottom of that pocket ! 
You have no time, you say, amid the press of school 
duties, to waste on mere forms of polite phraseology? 
What ! no time to be a lady or a gentleman ? Then you 
have no place in the teacher’s chair, whose occupant 
should never be aught else. 
And when all efforts prove futile, and the benefit to 
the pupil becomes hopelessly incommensurate with the
-P-A-G-E-30

harm his presence brings upon the school, let him be be- 
comingly remitted to the care of his legal and responsible 
guardian, to whose natural or parental instincts we may 
assume, as the law has done, the charge may be more 
safely confided. In the school-room, and within his own 
domain, the teacher stands in his own right, and will 
wisely omit those functions which only, as installed in 
loco parentis, he is allowed to exercise. 
I am aware of the heresy, to some minds, of these 
views, but am trying to present what seems to me the 
only true basis for the teacher’s authority—that his 
powers inhere of right in his oftice, whatever dicta to the 
contrary may be burrowed from among the dusty de- 
cisions of forgotten judges. We need not that any pa- 
rentis locus should be assigned us by the hocus-pocus of 
legal or judicial legerdemain, nor would we extend the 
limits of our domain beyond their natural bounds. We 
believe that school-grounds are defined, as any other 
grounds, by their legal boundaries, and that if the unruly 
urchin breaks his neighbor’s windows, or pilfers his pea- 
nut-stand, on the way to or from school, the: sufferer 
should look to the parent for redress ; and that, in case of 
accident or harm, the parent, and not the teacher, should 
employ the physician and pay the nurse. But we also 
believe that whatever exerts a baneful influence upon the 
school, or serves to bring it into disrepute, whether done 
within the precincts of the school-yard, upon the neigh- 
bor’s grounds, ‘‘or in the continuous woods where rolls 
the Oregon,” comes under the legitimate cognizance of 
the teacher, who, in the jealous care of his charge, may 
counsel, censure, or condemn. 
But why the school-grounds should extend to the 
father’s door, rather than the home circle expand to the 
school entrance, is to us a mystery.
-P-A-G-E-31
  MORAL TRAINING IN CITY SCHOOLS. 15 
The parent is charged with the duty of providing 
clothing, food, shelter, and home-training, and is re- 
sponsible to society for any neglect ; and under a like re- 
sponsibility is the teacher charged with his mental and 
moral training at school. The duties and the rights of 
the one, within his province, are as sacred and original, 
we apprehend, as the other. 
What is to be gained by this assumption of another’s 
part, which, by-the-way, is never urged, as we remember, 
except as involving the right to maul, maim, or mangle— 
a right that teachers or parents desirous of exercising it 
should be left to maintain with their best blows upon 
each other, with the children behind to prick and goad 
them on? 
As to the proper treatment of specific cases, and, in 
truth, as to general management and instruction, there is 
no rigid, unvarying method suited to all individuals, or 
to the same individual at all times. But for those fitted 
by culture, character, and disposition to be teachers, 
within certain limits, on which all thoughtful experience 
agrees, their usefulness is largely increased by a large 
infusion of their own personality; and, we fancy, the 
weightiest charge that can be brought against normal 
schools is, that their pupils are so often charged and over- 
charged with the idea that theirs is the way, and the only 
way, and hence their unwillingness to adapt themselves 
to their situation and surroundings, impervious to the 
advice and counsels of their associates or superiors. 
But, if there be one thing never to be lost sight of, it 
is that somehow the children should be interested in their 
work. The only point that Colonel Parker insists upon, | 
and the one that makes the thought of school a delight 
to every parent’s heart, is that the school shall be made 
pleasant to the children ; that they may no longer ‘‘ creep
-P-A-G-E-32
  16 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
like snail unwillingly to school,” but that the subjects 
shall be so vivified and so presented that a necessary ab- 
sence shall be a day of pleasure lost. Many a boy has 
doubtless been made a worthless if not a dangerous mem- 
ber of society by the irksomeness of his school-days. 
It is not alone by enforced restraint that these little 
bundles of activities are to be brought into relations of 
harmony and usefulness. Not more eager for what is new 
were Paul’s hearers on Mars Hill than they. Of quick 
discernment, of keen insight, and small respect for sham 
and pretense, they have not learned, as we, by long pupil- 
age, to sit contented with teachings they do not under- 
stand, or to keep step to music not in unison with their 
young heart-beats. 
Along the paths of learning, as well as in the world’s 
highway, they do not follow kindly the straight and beaten 
track, but soon pull away from the hand that leads them, 
now picking berries by the road-side, now in the field with 
hat in hand, in full chase of some bright butterfly, and 
again bending down to paddle in the pebbly brook ; and 
he is the wiser guide who, yielding somewhat to their 
wild humors, brings them in at the end, weary, it may 
be, but with many a little lesson learned and childish 
treasure garnered. 
Kindly and wisely to gather up these wild and chang- 
ing humors, and, without subduing the spirit or abat- 
ing the ardor, to unite them in one grand earnest pur- 
pose of life, is not the work of a novice or a trained 
dullard. 
Too often, I fear, we send forth even our best pupils 
with no aim beyond the diploma, no ambition but for the 
high mark, who, when the pressure of the class-room is 
lifted, float aimlessly out of the sparkling current of 
progress, like the bits of drift-wood that we see on the
-P-A-G-E-33
MORAL TRAINING IN CITY SCHOOLS. 17 
scum-covered pool below the busy mill of our New Eng- 
land streams. 
We, too, as teachers, need to keep ourselves in line 
and sympathy with the world’s advance, and not, like 
Hamlet, with the ghost of some dead past forever rising 
before us, permit it to chill our warm impulse, and hold 
us back from all worldly endeavor and achievement. 
We, too, need to join our strength and share our coun- 
sels with those of our own calling. We need to preserve 
so much of youth in our hearts as to find beauty and 
music in the floating butterfly and the babbling brook of 
boyhood. 
There are leaders and teachers among us, whose spoken 
or written thought we may not ignore. There is, too, 
the poetry, the science, the philosophy, the art, the his- 
tory, the romance of our own and other days around us 
that we may not neglect. And it may well be matter of 
astonishment how few are the fruits and flowers, from any 
of these sources, that may not be put to use in our daily 
work, in suggestion, in striking example, in apt illus- 
tration, in encouragement, in instruction. 
And some such allurement is ofttimes required to 
draw us out of ourselves, to relieve that depression and 
weariness, that sinking of heart, that sometimes come on 
us, when the day’s work is over, and we feel exhausted of 
our electric force by five hours’ contact with threescore 
bristling fragments of humanity. 
When all else fails, and ‘this whole round world 
seems flat, stale, and unprofitable,” as a sure and safe 
resource there is nothing for health, strength, and rec- 
reation, like a good, reliable hobby. Though it be noth- 
ing rarer or more costly than moth-hunting, the jingle 
or jangle of rhymes, or even reformed spelling, they are, 
some of them, as I well know, of boundless possibilities.

18 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
But at your daily mount of your hobby-horse, take 
not your way down the crowded street, and through the 
thronging mart, nor over the choice flower-beds and 
fragrant exotics of your friends; but rather turn aside 
into the quiet lane, or the unfrequented country road, 
or, still better, off for a free stretch over the wide, open 
prairie, where, with tossing arms and expanding chest, 
you can shout forth your happiness, till with loud-an- 
swering echo, the solitary places shall be made glad with 
your presence. 
Still onward till your beast and yourself are weary, and 
returning, see that he is well groomed and stalled, and in 
due time properly fed, in preparation for another day, and it 
may be the coming age will raise to you and it a monument. 
We conclude, then, that leaving to the philosopher 
the abstruse questions of thought, and without trenching 
upon the beliefs or prejudices of any respectable portion 
of society, we have in our public schools the most certain 
and most efficient agencies for the moral culture of the 
young; the habit of quiet order, the diligent industry, 
the systematic method, and above all, or rather the pledge 
and security for all, the generous, the disciplined, the 
cultured, the ever-progressive teacher, one whom we would 
gladly receive into our homes as companions, and as guides 
and guardians of our children. 
In the mutual rights and duties of the family and 
social relations, the rights of the child, we believe, are 
paramount. If the parent or the State has a claim upon 
the child for devotion and service, much more has the 
child, as the involuntary partner, a moral right to be 
educated for these relations. And with the truer aims 
and better methods of to-day, may we not fairly hope for 
an ever-increasing recognition: and fuller satisfaction of 
this, his supreme right ?

oT 
THE CHARACTER OF THE TEACHER. 
Tr is not so long ago but you may almost count the 
years on the fingers of one hand since society was sud- 
denly startled from its sense of serenity, as by thunder 
from a clear sky. 
A great man who had spent his life in giving instruc- 
tion had died, and upon reading his will it was found 
that he had truthfully signed himself, ‘‘ Louis Agassiz, 
Teacher.” 
The provisions of the will were too important to have 
it set aside on the ground of insanity, and therefore the 
wide republic was called upon to contribute for a memo- 
rial to the self-forgetfulness of the man who, in the ex- 
ercise of a sound mind, could calmly write himself 
“Teacher.” 
And this is not a solitary expression of a large public 
sentiment. In all English literature down to one of the 
last magazine novels of the present editor of ‘‘The Atlan- 
tic,” the schoolmaster has been regarded as a legitimate 
object of ridicule. 
“Tom Brown at Rugby” alone in literature has shown 
that the schoolmaster may be a man, noble, scholarly, 
humane, gentle, in the best sense of the word; and that 
the school-boy, instead of being his natural enemy and 
providential tormentor, may become his loving disciple 
and most devoted friend. 
We need not be careful to deny that there have been, 
and still are, some sufficient reasons for these abounding 
views, if from their caricatures, satires, and flippant 
pleasantries we may be led to discover the weak points in 
our character and work, and to learn how to come nearer

that high ideal which we cherish and to which, with 
greater or less earnestness, we all aspire—how we may 
slough off the old follies and foibles which have gathered 
around the names of schoolmaster and pedagogue and 
stand among the intelligent and refined with the honor 
and esteem which should clothe the name of teacher. 
For what business or profession calls for a deeper insight, 
wiser methods, or more delicate and skillful treatment, 
or is more important to society, than that of quickening 
the intellect and developing and molding the character 
of those who, as men and women, are so soon to control 
all our interests ? It may be true that all these little ones 
have their natural and hereditary traits, which in a deeper 
sense form their characters, and which may not be changed 
or obliterated ; but the possible outcomes of these, as the 
result of the teacher’s influence, may show a difference as 
wide as the universe. 
And could the practical, earnest men and women ac- 
curately measure the results—could we take account of 
stock, and compute percentages of profit and loss in 
mind and morals, as we can in hardware and dry-goods 
and groceries—our successes or failures would meet with 
other return than taunt and gibe, and the study of the 
columns of statistics in our reports would not end with 
the proof-reader. 
This school-keeping of ours is not a makeshift, a catch- 
penny device, a means for tiding over an unforeseen bar 
in our business career, a ready resort from the tedium of 
housekeeping, a flirtation with small literature, a free 
fountain by the wayside, where the tired traveler may slake 
his thirst and pass on, but a high calling, where, if any- 
where, are required intellectual attainments, an active in- 
telligence, tact, special training, and that well-balanced self- 
poise which we sometimes call manhood and womanhood.
-P-A-G-E-37
THE CHARACTER OF THE TEACHER. 21 
Nowhere is the waif and estray of fortune and of life 
so out of place as in the school-room, and nowhere as in 
the school may one contribute to the welfare of his kind, 
and see the result of cheerful, hearty, unwearied well- 
doing ; and nowhere is there greater need of a healthful, 
harmonious, and ever- widening growth in mind and 
character. 
It is said that we are so unfortunate as not to be 
brought in contact with those of our own age, our equals 
or superiors in maturity of thought and in acquirements, 
from association with whom we might strengthen our 
reason and judgment, sharpen our wit, and enlarge our 
stock of information, but must bring ourselves down to 
the comprehension of the immature and the ignorant. 
Unlike those in other professions, too, who may push 
their inquiries into the higher and broader fields of 
thought and fancy, or penetrate those deeps where fathom- 
line has never reached, we are to teach merely those sim- 
ple elements and truths which are assumed to be the 
common property of all, which we ourselves may have 
taught a hundred times, till the very wheels of thought 
have become mired and clogged in the little ruts them- 
selves have made. 
Nor does our school life take hold upon the active 
and ever-multiplying industries of the day, which fill the 
coffers of the rich, or which surround with comforts and 
luxuries, or crown with office and honor the self-seeking 
and the ambitious. 
And from the very nature and conditions of our work 
we may not wisely engage in the partisan and sectarian 
strifes and discussions which are the especial birthright 
of a people who are but even now beginning to realize 
the full power of free thought and free speech, by which 
their destiny is to be wrought out.

We are also each but a member of a great system, sub- 
ject to its laws, with no opportunity, like the merchant, 
the banker, and the railroad magnate, by wiser fore- 
thought, larger enterprise, and broader combinations, to 
reap that richer harvest to ourselves of profit and power 
which comes of well-directed, successful effort. 
We may not so often hear our deeds heraided to the 
public ear in noisy huzzas ; but the fault is ours if in the 
hearts of the wise and good the name of teacher is not 
held in honor. 
There is a way of teaching, and sometimes by earnest 
teachers, too, that is narrowing and belittling, and an 
educational literature that is its most faithful ally. 
The pictures of a Goldsmith and a Scott, of an Irving 
and a Dickens, present features of a type of schoolmasters 
in which we can detect the lineaments of a species not 
yet wholly extinct ; but let us hope they may be found in 
the near future only by the fossil-hunter in the dense 
jungles of ignorance which the light of the age has not 
pierced, or imbedded in the quagmires of superstition 
which the ingenuity of science has not spanned. 
Be it that we have to do with children and youth, 
with those whose hungry hearts are not yet sated, nor 
their restless feet grown weary ; whose lisping lips and 
tripping tongues have not become shaped to the hard 
phrase of an all-grasping greed, or familiar with the be- 
wildering jargon of boards of trade ; on whose sweet 
senses pure pleasures have not palled, nor the fair fruits 
of folly yielded their full bitterness; and to whom dull 
drudgery has not come in the attractive guise of that 
divinity of labor through whom we can conquer all 
things ; that their sacred instincts have not been so in- 
sulted and trampled upon by stupidity and prejudice as 
to refuse longer to act as guides to what their nature

  THE CHARACTER OF THE TEACHER. 23 
craves for its sustenance and development ; that the spirit 
has not so lost its magnetic sensitiveness by long contact 
with dull or dead natures as not to be attracted by kind- 
ness, trust, and confidence, and repelled by harshness, 
sneers, and ridicule; that, in short, the child is fresh, 
active, ardent, restless, and impulsive, in the midst of a 
world to him as new, as curious, as attractive, as un- 
known as himself, where he must conquer or fail for him- 
self. 
This human child in its complexity and its delicacy, 
in its weakness and its possibilities, is the real, unsolved 
problem of our schools, and the man or woman fitted by 
nature, education, thought, and experience to discern the 
true conditions and rightly apply the means for its solu- 
tion, their greatest need. 
Before the days of Franklin the lightning was known 
only as the dangerous attendant of the thunder-storm, 
coming to frighten the ignorant, and fill the heart of the 
wise man with awe. But when he found it to be no 
supernatural imp, but the familar of his laboratory, he 
stripped it of its direst terrors, showing how it might be 
turned aside and its wrath averted. Then came the 
lightning-rod man, to most persons an object of dread 
only less than that of the original lightning. A wiser 
generation has learned that by proper guidance electricity 
may become one of our most efficient and tractable agents 
in diffusing and transmitting light and intelligence. 
So the inextinguishable boyishness of the boy, the 
terror of the schoolma’am and the wonder of the peda- 
gogue, which in the olden time was seen but as an ele- 
ment of turbulence and confusion, to be shunned by the 
order-loving and the peaceful, a later day learned to avoid 
by turning it from the school-room to the street, possibly 
relieving the school but increasing the real evil.

A praiseworthy motive, no doubt, dictated this course, 
to avoid the mental and moral pyemia sure to result if 
the evil should be taken up and spread through the sys- 
tem ; but a too long and continuous drain of even ‘laud- 
able pus” weakens and ruins at the last. 
It but remains for those who control our schools, it 
remains for us, as teachers, to turn this old-time bane 
into a blessing. We have to learn, not how to check 
those restless feet, but how to direct them gracefully into 
the right paths; not how to stifle the craving of those 
eager hearts, but to supply the nutriment, which they 
with joy can receive and assimilate ; we must labor not to 
hush and still those babbling tongues, but to find the 
words of truth and wisdom, which they may understand- 
ingly pronounce ; not to dull the sharp sense, that so 
often leads away from our wishes and regulations, but to 
impart a zest to our teachings, so sweetly to mingle toil 
and play, that each shall be in its turn a delight; not to 
deaden or destroy the instinctive tendencies of his ex- 
panding being, but kindly and wisely to bring them into 
a willing subjection to a higher reason, guided by a more 
enlightened understanding; to remove the tedium of 
heartless toil, by a more thorough study of the child 
nature; by noting, with as keen an eye as the bee-hunter’s, 
what course his instincts would take, and placing before 
him in each stage of his course the subjects and problems 
of nature, life, and art, with which his outreaching spirit 
may successfully and lovingly grapple. 
Can the ambitious student of nature find enough to 
satisfy the longings of his soul in bending over a butterfly 
or a beetle, and the philologist seek his immortality of 
fame in devotion to the dative case, and are we degraded 
by our endeavors to understand this crowning expression 
of creative power ?

THE CHARACTER OF THE TEACHER. 25 
There is an essential truth in the spirit of the remark 
attributed to Mr. Garfield, when a member of Congress. 
When some alumni and friends of Williams College were 
discussing its needs in the way of books and apparatus, 
and turned to him for his opinion, he is said to have re- 
plied, «Give me a log-cabin in the center of the State, 
having but one room, containing a rough bench, with Dr. 
Hopkins on one end and me on the other, and there is a 
college for me.” And well mightitbe. A large-minded, a 
great-hearted, a fully-equipped, and well-trained man, in 
wise and intimate converse with an intelligent and rever- 
ing pupil, guiding yet following his earnest but often 
halting efforts to clear up the manifold mysteries of mind 
and matter around him, and the greatest of all, the ex- 
tent and the powers of his own mental and moral being, 
the teacher too great, too earnest to be dwarfed or hin- 
dered—himself, perhaps, the greater learner of the two. 
A narrow basis of character or purpose must he haye 
who fears to stoop to the comprehension of his little learn- 
ers, who rather dare not rise toward the height of his 
profession. 
He whose growth ceases with his graduation from 
school or college, whose certificate to teach crowns the 
last effort of an exhausted spirit, may suffer by suffering 
the little children to come too near, or to draw too closely 
about him, for the wisest man will often find himself at 
fault in answering their legitimate inquiries, and often 
feels a momentary impulse to meet the difficulty by the 
time-honored method of putting that child to bed. 
There can be no more dangerous heresy for our 
schools than the sentiment which would depreciate the 
scholarly attainments and character of our teachers. 
Scholarship alone does not of necessity imply the 
ability to teach, but this ability is quite as likely to be

26 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
  the companion of learning as of ignorance, and experi- 
ence shows that if accurate scholarship and correct speech 
be wanting, the aptness is quite as apt to teach error as 
truth. 
The days of the A-B-C-darians, and the three R’s— 
ah ! ah! and alas !—have happily gone by, and hard after 
them are following those to whom the ability to trace with 
index-finger, word by word, and line by line, the pupil’s 
progress down the page of the text-book, was enough. 
The eager applicant for a position advancing through 
the room with the exclamation : “‘ Have you did it yet? 
I want it awful,” probably had that qualification ; and 
the candidate for a place as principal of one of our great 
schools, with its score of teachers, and its ten or twelve 
hundred pupils, would hardly have hazarded ‘‘ Cardinal 
Wolsey and John of Gaunt” as “leading statesmen of 
George III’s reign,” with the text-book before his eyes. 
We fear such teachers, even when briaging their apt 
gifts. 
That the teacher should be familiar with the meager 
contents of the text-book goes without the saying, but 
this is but a small and comparatively insignificant part 
of his accomplishments, and the memorizing of the brief 
pages but one of the several results to be aimed at for 
the pupil’s benefit. The clear conception, the power of 
thought, of comparison and judgment, and the easy, con- 
cise, correct expression, are distinct objects, each fully 
as important as the facts themselves. 
No grade so small but some definite and ready knowl- 
edge of the vegetable and animal life about us is an 
essential part of the teacher’s outfit.

the school-room, without infringing upon the high-school 
course, and sometimes* without leaving the skill of the 
high-school graduate in physics and astronomy untasked. 
That grasp of mathematics which, outside the province 
of the lightning calculator, comprehends something of 
the logic of numbers and their application, to see what 
we have, and what we want, and the direct road to our 
destination, needs to be nerved by a stronger diet of 
algebra and geometry than the averages of our examina- 
tions would often indicate. 
To what useful purpose do our pupils learn from the 
book the names of the ten important towns of Massachu- 
setts, without knowing so much as whether they are 
something to be laid away in safes, or strung up to dry 
like the oldwives’ apples; or to learn that Minnesota 
produces wheat, Kentucky tobacco, and Louisiana sugar, 
still ignorant whether they are picked like apples from 
trees, or dug from the ground like potatoes; or why 
spend much time or thought at all on the what or the 
where of the Angora cat ? 
And should not he who directs the education of the 
child have some acquaintance with the laws of mental 
growth and development? I mean, not the deep pon- 
derings and abstruse reasonings of the metaphysician, 
and the recluse, but those accepted principles of mental 
action which may guide to the right mode and order 
of presenting the different subjects—something of the 
material upon which he works, and the tools to be em- 
ployed. 
There are more fruitful themes for our primary pupils 
than nice classifications and technical definitions. What 
not to teach is often as important a problem as how to 
teach. Why confuse our children with the nature and 
kinds of sentences before they have them at command ?
-P-A-G-E-44

28 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
Classification becomes useful when the multiplicity of 
objects becomes perplexing and burdensome. 
Double entry is not of advantage in running a peanut- 
stand. 
Hardly would two grammarians define a sentence 
alike ; and should two, perchance, be found to agree, a 
third would doubtless start up in astonishment and eager 
protest. 
We would not wish our small graders to know what 
a sentence is, or that there are such troublesome things 
in existence. 
And worst of all is this attempt to bring down the 
higher and more difficult studies of riper years within 
the grasp of the infant mind by the use of those twad- 
dling terms which it will soon be the hardest task to 
unlearn. What a burlesqué of education to tell a child, 
as yet unable to read readily, to write a telling sentence 
about a cat! A telling sentence, truly, but telling most 
of the absurdity of the method. 
Things come before names, use before theories, speak-. 
ing before writing, the whole before its parts, words 
before letters. 
Think of the time spent on the interjection oh! 
which seems to have a sort of monopoly of primers and 
first readers, though rarely found elsewhere, or used save 
by young girls and teachers. Intelligence is not largely 
interjectional. 
What marvels of uselessness we can make of ourselves 
with the aid of the book-makers! I can now recall, as 
but of yesterday, and doubt not my freed spirit will find 
encysted somewhere in its incorporeal anatomy, the old 
definition of ‘‘ punctuation, which is the art of dividing 
a written composition into sentences or parts of sentences 
by points or stops, to mark the different pauses which the

sense requires,” which, for any good resulting there- 
from, might fitly have been subscribed, ‘‘Truly yours, 
Theophilus Thistle, the thistle-sifter.” These things all 
haye their uses, and in their due time and order pass 
grandly into our curriculum through the wide doors of 
reason and enlightenment, instead of toddling in by the 
back door and nursery. 
And is not the wise study of the times and methods 
of teaching the several topics as high a pursuit as meas- 
uring off tape or weighing sugar, or packing a caucus ? 
And is not the pursuit as much the part and the pro- 
moter of wisdom, as how to secure a seat or a vote in 
council or Legislature ? And does not the worthy teacher 
need a broader and deeper reading of books and character 
than is found in our prescribed lists? And may not the 
hundredth repetition of the same lesson be better directed, 
more simply and plainly presented, and more judiciously 
and pleasingly illustrated than any of the preceding ? 
And is not she well deserving who devotes some of the 
evening and, it may be, the morning hours to those 
studies which shall enliven and enrich the labor of the 
class-room ? 
I remember lately to have read some complaint that 
we teach so much that is not needed in the counting- 
room ; surely it is devoutly to be hoped. There are, to 
my mind, few sadder pictures than that of a thinking, 
reasoning being shut in, from youth to hoary age, to the 
requirements of the counting-room : 
. .. from the cheerful ways of men 
Cut off, and for the book of knowledge fair 
Presented with a universal blank 
Of Nature’s works, to him expunged and ’rased.

Of such a one, perhaps, Wordsworth wrote : 
The multiplication table was his creed 
His paternoster and his decalogue; 
For in a close and dusty counting-house 
He had so smoke-dried and seared and shriveled up 
His heart, that when the dirt shall now 
Be shoveled on him, ’twill still be dust to dust. 
But most of all do we need to get rid of the paltriness, 
the littleness, the petty tyranny, the false and easily of- 
fended dignity that still lurk and linger in the dusty 
corners of our system. We desire that the mention of 
school and teacher should suggest something other than 
strap and rattan and ruler; that some other question 
should be found to ask our returning pupils at nightfall 
than ‘‘ How many times have you been pinched or beaten 
to-day ?” We want our teachers—men and women—too 
big, too manly, too womanly to be able to be insulted by 
any child intrusted to his or her care—too much in sym- 
pathy with the child-nature to see a design in every error, 
a covert crime in every unmeaning glance ; and we want 
our pupils so confident of the good-will and calm, just 
discrimination of the teacher as to honestly and frankly 
come and report any accidental wrong-doing without fear 
or dread. 
I wish I had the gift of speech that would enable me 
to express my thought, to give clear voice to the feeling 
that comes over me in the still, small hours, when 
thought can range unhindered by the cares and annoy- 
ances of the outer world. 
Think of yourselves at the call and beck of the parent 
who could take his little boy or girl up to the public 
whipping-post to be flogged by a hired baster, and him 
or her to be found in the free school, and there intrusted 
with the tenderest and most delicate interests of life !

  THE CHARACTER OF THE TEACHER. 81 
Believe me, my fellow-teachers, our schools will be 
mentioned with scorn and our names spoken with con- 
tempt till we cast aside this relic of a by-gone age, and 
cease to be the sole representatives of a debased and de- 
grading barbarism. 
I was glad at our last school anniversary to be able to 
congratulate teachers and pupils that there was one 
school-building in this city where, for a quarter of a 
century, the work of instruction had gone on, like the 
building of Solomon’s temple, with never the sound of 
blows within its walls. 
A recent number of the “Journal of Education” 
cites one of those so considered extreme cases, where 
the writer would ‘‘like the privilege of resorting to phys- 
ical suasion.” ‘‘A rough, hulking fellow,” it goes on to 
say, ‘‘down on Cape Cod, in answer to a mild reproof 
from his teacher, a nice, lady-like girl, said, ‘I’d punch 
yer head for ye, if ye warn’t a woman.’” And he, of 
course, should be whanged and pounded? We would 
show him, then, that our self-respect, aided by a greater 
maturity of thought and judgment, could not restrain us 
from doing the self-same act from which he had been 
withheld by respect for another. 
If he had been sent to me, I would rather have said, 
in effect: ‘‘My young friend, I am glad to learn that 
you stand one of the truest tests of manliness. No man 
is to be despaired of so long as he preserves a true respect 
for woman. But that is not the way to speak to a lady. 
She isn’t a fish-woman. If I were you, when I found an 
opportunity, I would tell her that, in my anger, I had 
done what I was ashamed of when I thought of it—not 
unless you want to; but I fancy you’d feel yourself twice 
the man after it. Come and see me again within a day 
or two.”

One of our most experienced and successful teachers 
asked me, not long since, if I remembered such and such , 
a one, who used to be in school. I was forced to admit 
very distinct recollections of them. 
“But we have had no such cases,” said he, ‘‘of late 
years ; and, do you know,” he continued, with more than 
his wonted tenderness—‘‘ do you know that I often think 
I should have had no trouble with them if I had known 
anything ?” in which opinion I was forced also to ac- 
quiesce. 
The work of education is to enkindle and instruct, 
not merely to quench and repress ; yet how confidently, 
in answer to my some time suggestion that such a teacher 
is not specially successful, comes the quick reply, ‘‘I do 
not know why not—I keep them still!” So, haply, would 
sleep or death, forsooth, for even ghosts tread softly and 
speak low ; but, as in the young groves and bright mead- 
ows of spring-time, so in the school; we love the gentle 
murmur and rustle of ‘‘the green things growing.” 
Do not misunderstand me. I believe in the advan- 
tage—the necessity—of quiet order as thoroughly as any 
one ; but when the whole force of the teacher is expended 
in the perpetual endeavor to hush and suppress the undi- 
rected activities of the school-room, I feel that she has 
not been ‘‘ put where she can do the most good.” 
It may not indicate any lack of intelligence that one 
is not successful in school, more than the inability to 
sing or play the violin would do so. There is many and 
many ‘‘a nice girl,” on and off of Cape Cod, who can 
not wisely keep a school of hulking boys; but there 
are enough who can. 
It has been a much-mooted question, of late, with 
writers and speakers on education, “How shall we ob- 
tain good teachers for our schools?” It does not seem
-P-A-G-E-49
THE CHARACTER OF THE TEACHER. oo 
to me a difficult conundrum. It is much like Horace 
Greeley’s ‘‘way to resume.” If we do not have good teach- 
ers in our schools, it is simply because—no, not because 
we do not want them, but because we do not employ 
them ; consciously or unconsciously we allow other mo- 
tives to influence us. 
How it may be in the smaller towns I do not know, 
but, in the larger ones, I believe we can have just as good 
teachers as we choose. The bright men, the intelligent 
men, the able, the earnest men do not, by any means, all 
go into the professions and trade of choice. Even with 
the present inadequate pay, there are good teachers 
enough—lovers of the work—to fill our positions. 
But to throw off some of the old traditions, or rather 
the old associations, which still cling to our names and 
to our work, is a task in which the best lover of them all 
will find a field for his most earnest endeavor. 
There have been, as it seems to me, two grand im- 
pulses given to education in this country. 
The first came from the life and labors of Horace 
Mann, whose intense enthusiasm and burning words 
stirred the heart of New England, as had never been done 
before, to the importance of universal education, the need 
of more systematic methods, and the necessity for edu- 
cated and carefully trained teachers. 
I have tried to recall an extract from a Fourth-of-July 
oration of his before the authorities of Boston, which I 
learned when a pupil in school, though I have not seen 
it since: 
«For, in the name of the living God,” he says, ‘it 
must be proclaimed that superstition shall be the religion, 
that licentiousness shall be the liberty, and that anarchy 
shall be the law of that people which neglects the educa- 
tion of its children.” 
4 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
84 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
The second grand impulse, wholly unlike the first, but 
no less valuable in its place, came, I think, from the 
reading of ‘‘' Tom Brown at Rugby.” 
It was said by one of Dr. Arnold’s friends that, if he 
should be elected head-master at Rugby, he would change 
the face of education in England. 
However that may have been, his influence, through 
“Tom Brown,” if it has not changed the face, has gone 
far to work out a change of heart in the better schools of 
these Northern States. 
We may have learned elsewhere of the life and work 
of Arnold—his character, his methods, his reforms. But 
“Tom Brown,” passing into the hands of young and old, 
gave an insight into the real spirit and power of the man, 
as seen and interpreted by the author, with a delicacy of 
sentiment and a nobleness of feeling which most of us, I 
fear, would not, unaided, have seen so clearly in the doc- 
tor himself. 
This is one of the few cases, we suspect, in which the 
translation does full justice to the original. 
This spirit of manliness, so largely pervading our bet- 
ter schools, had its origin, we think, in a good degree in 
“Tom Brown at Rugby,” with which many of our own 
citizens are, doubtless, more familiar than with our 
schools in Chicago. And if some of those who, from time 
to time, call loudly for reform, were as well acquainted 
with the inner life of some of our schools as with that of 
the great schools of England, they would find that we 
have not only ‘outgrown our own bragging,” but have 
left some of their ideal reforms a whole decade behind us. 
It is, then, no new principles that we are urging. 
The deep conviction, the change of heart, have already 
begun. We should now strive for that inner growth 
which shall find expression in a fuller, completer life.

The coming generation, that is to make or unmake 
our city, our State, and our country, is already filling the 
air with its prattle, its laughter, its cries. 
Some of them even now, through neglect, are stum- 
bling and falling in the ways of ignorance and crime ; 
some straying, uncared for, into the haunts of vice and 
misery ; the larger and better portion, let us hope, with 
fresh hearts and bright faces, timidly, gleefully, hopefully 
advancing, singly and in groups, to the school-house. 
Society is waiting, calling—earnestly, anxiously—for 
men and women of broader culture and nobler nature— 
men and women of quick intelligence, of enlightened 
understanding, of large heart and generous impulse, to 
take these little ones by the hand and lead them into the 
pleasant ways of wisdom, virtue, usefulness, and happi- 
ness. 
It remains to be seen how many of us will step for- 
ward in sympathy with this call of the age, with a ready, 
a hearty ‘Ay, ay, sirs!”

WHILE the rebel angels were waiting, in the outer

desirable, or raised man so near the divine, in the estima- 
tion of his fellows, as this foreknowledge, this power to 
discern the future. It has invested the seer, the prophet, 
and the soothsayer with a reverence which still casts its 
mysterious shadow over the otherwise transparent frauds 
of the modern fortune-teller, and even the prognostics of 
a Venner. 
Face to face with the unknown, with all the forces of 
nature and life surging around us, in our seeming help- 
lessness and ignorance, we are at all times tempted to 
ery, ‘‘Oh, that I only knew!” Whether the acquisition 
would be beneficial or not, or even possible, by the en- 
dowment of some new sense, so attractive is the thought 
that, in comparison, we are apt to underestimate or forget 
the importance of that hardly less valuable power of look- 
ing back at what has been—that power through which 
the whole past of nature and of man is spread before us 
like a map, with his deeds of glory and of shame; the 
revolution of worlds and of thought; the rise and fall of 
nations, as of tides; through which we can deduce the 
laws by which continents are built up, and suns and 
planets hung forth as lamps; the laws of growth and de- 
cay, of failure and success, of happiness and woe ; ena- 
bling us not only to recreate the lost past, but with one 
hand to put aside the veil, and with apocalyptic vision 
descry the future, too, so that we seem no longer walking 
as into the night, but make even the darkness light before 
our steps, and direct our course among the mysteries of 
life as confidently and unerringly as ever in boyhood 
through our own father’s house. 
How all these fading phases of life are copied, and 
written down, and preserved ; where they are stored for 
our use, and by what secret process of will or association 
they are made to come forth at our bidding, we may well

leave to what by a sweet euphemism is called philogo- 
phy, to which distance and obscurity the great enchant- 
ment lend. 
Enough for our present purpose to know that the past 
by some hidden power is made ours; that the events of 
our lives are thus photographed ; our thoughts and feel- 
ings recorded, as in sympathetic ink, and the require- 
ments of to-day laid away and guarded, as by some faith- 
ful servitor, to be handed forth at our call and desire ; 
that thus alone are reason and intelligence made possible, 
and life worth the living. And to us, as teachers, it be- 
comes a matter of the first importance to understand the 
true relation of the memory to the other powers, that we 
may not undervalue it, as the great storehouse of the 
mind, and by neglect allow our pupils to become little 
better than mental tramps, calculating without capital, 
and restless with no resources; or, by our overestimate 
or misapprehension, make of them miserly paupers, hug- 
ging their intellectual hoards to their hungry hearts, 
wonders in dreary details and dates and dry statistics, 
but worthless for any productive work, or for any service 
to society. 
It is this memory by which the child in the first wak- 
ing of its intelligence learns to discern the mother’s face, 
and by associating with it the little joys and pleasures 
which love and sympathy have been able to bestow, ere 
long to distinguish the sound, the spoken name by which 
the ever-present heeder of its wants is known, till the word 
mother, the synonym of all kindness and unselfish faith- 
fulness and unexacting love, becomes the dearest, the ten- 
derest, the truest, and most sacred word in all literature.

those first inarticulate incoherencies are molded into the 
sustained melody and eloquence of a Milton or a Pitt. 
It is this, too, by which he becomes familiar with the 
little world of his nursery, and learns to discriminate be- 
tween the objects around him, and—by recalling his pre- 
vious ineffectual grasps—to know that the moon is beyond 
his reach ; to judge of distance by sight and sound; to 
compass his first exultant stumble from the chair to his 
mother’s outstretched hand, and convert it into the stride 
of a Hercules, or the bound of an Apollo ; which, in short, 
saves us all from a perpetual babyhood of ignorance and 
imbecility, forever beginning and never advancing ; gath- 
ering the sweet and sparkling drops of life into the bot- 
tomless bucket of forgetfulness, from which no draughts 
can ever be drained of strength or hope. 
Yet, not alone does memory give power or wisdom ; 
it accumulates material, but never selects or constructs ; 
it heaps up rubbish as readily as it fills treasures ; it re- 
cords errors and sorrows as well as successes and joys, but 
of itself teaches neither how to avoid the one nor to secure 
and increase the other. 
And in the various branches of our school-work, what 
are the things to be memorized ; under what conditions, 
and by what means the memory may best secure the de- 
sired results, and how its resources may be most wisely 
and securely invested, and by what guardianship made 
most available for the future life and progress of their 
pupils, may well command the frequent and earnest 
thought of every teacher. 
The average child of six years already upon entering 
school has, in greater or less completeness, his little vo- 
cabulary, sufficient for the needs of his daily life. He 
has seen the dog, the tree, the bird, has heard and re- 
membered the sounds which we call names, has associated
-P-A-G-E-55
THE PLACE OF MEMORY IN SCHOOL INSTRUCTION. 289 
with them the utterances, which we designate by ‘‘ barks” 
and “grows” and ‘‘sings,” and has laid them one by 
one away within easy reach in his memory. 
He has noted the motion of the lip when others have 
pronounced the words, and one by one by many an effort 
has himself mastered the wondrous art, which he has 
practiced with ever-new delight, till now, almost without 
a conscious effort, as if by intuition, the words talk them- 
selves. ‘To him a word is a word, a simple utterance, is 
what he says, which he has never analyzed, never thought 
about, and he knows no more why this or that sound 
stands for this or that thing, or act, than—we ourselves, 
How he has loved to live and learn! Like the lambs 
in their pastures, life has been to him a joy. He has 
talked and laughed and run and climbed, winning ever 
some new word, some wisdom, some power, and always 
some new happiness; and now, in the glad pride of his 
little heart, he has come to school. He is a scholar ; he 
is going to learn to read. 
Those objects, those acts, and those feelings, for 
which he has learned the sounds, he is now to see repre- 
sented by marks, by printed, written characters. The 
primer, the volume, the wisdom, the poetry, the elo- 
quence of the ages are to be opened and revealed to him, 
and why should he not be proud and glad ? 
His first twenty, or forty, or two hundred words are 
to be memorized, learned as simple words, mere arbitrary 
characters for simple sounds, as wholes and not yet in 
their parts, one or two to-day, and the others to-morrow 
and the next day ; he is to learn to know them, to make 
them, and so familiarly, by seeing, by speaking, and by 
writing, that the character shall always suggest the sound, 
the sound the character, all unconsciously, as he has al- 
ready associated the sound and the object or act.

A different thing, as he soon finds, from chasing but~ 
terflies and making mud-pies, is this filling his slate with 
words, only to erase them and fill it again—that modern 
refinement and combination of pillory and thumb-screw. 
The lively, eager attention, the first requisite and 
condition of memorizing, soon gives place to dull and 
painful listlessness, if not to revolt and lawlessness, since 
now the second condition of memory, frequent repetition, 
has been carried to a nauseating satiety. 
Now must the ingenuity, the art, the power of the 
teacher, like the voice of the Master to the sinking Peter, 
appear or he perishes. Instead of the frequent repetition, 
the word must be wrought into sentences alive with a 
new meaning. The object must be at hand, the picture 
presented,.the perception called into exercise, the little 
story told and repeated, the interest awakened. 
As we know of matter only through force, and of force 
only through matter, so in these early days of school life 
must the thing and the word become forever associated 
by coustant practice. Dull repetition must give place to 
pleasing variety ; the words of yesterday wrought into 
the lessons of to-day and to-morrow ; the new words of 
to-day pointed out, written, talked about before com- 
mencing the lesson, or as an introduction. Thus, instead 
of being a stumbling-block in the path of his reading, 
now will the new word glisten like a new coin among its 
dingy companions, and its easy mastery on the new page 
fill him with the pride, the happiness of a conqueror. 
But the storing of the memory with accumulations of 
forms and facts is of little use, unless they can be at once 
and with ease reproduced and wrought into new creations, 
with different effects and for other purposes. The pupil 
with his learning must be always using his acquisitions. 
He must be led to talk and talk correctly. Very early in
-P-A-G-E-57

his school life does he form those habits that never leave 
him, even by prayer and fasting. Those little errors that 
we learned in childhood, even now after beating them 
down for a score or two of years, in some careless moment 
will start up as fresh and strong as if they had never 
known defeat. 
Here in the early grade is determined whether in his 
utterance he shall be clear, open, distinct, articulate, cor- 
rect, or go through grammar and high school, perchance 
through college and university, with hang-dog air and in- 
coherent mutterings. 
Here, by question and answer, by recital and story, 
before he can yet busy himself with the printed or written 
page, he should become familiar with the common forms 
of speech—man, men, children, child, am, is, are, a, an— 
not by rule or definition, but by use in all the variety of 
their combinations. These are for permanent use; forms 
that are always used, and by all, and their correct use is 
all memory and habit—habit so strong and confirmed 
that the effort escapes detection. It should be made ere 
Jong so thoroughly a part of himself that he would no 
more think of saying ‘‘ we is,” ‘‘ I done it,” ‘‘ he has went,” 
“them books,” than of putting his food into his ears. 
But no definition ; nothing of “sentence, asking sen- 
tence, telling sentence”; no ‘action words, naming 
words, relation words”; no rules. It should yet be all 
use. He who talks by rule never talks well. With true 
culture words come as the winds come, and we hear the 
sound thereof. 
Memory quickened by association with some object or 
purpose, enlivened by variety and novelty, made repro- 
ductive by new applications requiring ingenuity and skill 
on the pupil’s part, is the chief reliance and hope of the 
lower grades.

This is the receptive period, when the underlying 
material for future upbuilding is to be secured. It is the 
curious, the observing period, when all is still fresh and 
new, when the child’s thought is ever on the wing from 
flower to flower, from sweet to sweet—ever bearing, too, 
like the bee from blossom to blossom, the fertilizing dust 
that shall make them all hereafter richer of flower and 
fruit ; the period, too, when all objects quickly pall upon 
the sense. 
The fixity of thought, the close observation and com- 
parison, the nice analysis, the weighing and balancing of 
reasons and probabilities, which are the delight of the 
trained intellect, play a small part in his young life. His 
purposes are as fleeting as his laughter or his tears ; there 
is no place in his nature for mere routine. 
The memorized rules and definitions have to him no 
meaning, and to force them upon him is but to send him 
blindfold into a field of rich and rare products, whose 
pathways he has not yet learned, and whose beauties he 
has not yet seen; or to lead him painfully and sadly by 
the hand, when with the bandage removed— 
The stream, the wood, the earth, the skies, 
Would be to him an opening paradise. ~ 
As in a gallery of pictured landscapes there is in each 
the mead, the hill, the tree, the stream, with a touch of 
human or animal life, but always in different combina- 
tion, with varied relations, 0 should the monotony of 
dull repetition on the printed page be relieved. 
The words that are recited and written to-day should 
be woven and wreathed into other figures and expressions 
to-morrow ; and thus repetition, one of the most efficient 
means for memory’s aid, invested with all the charm of 
novelty. 
Twenty minutes a day with young pupils will often

have a double value if ten be given to the forenoon and 
ten to the afternoon. 
To pronounce or spell a word twice or twenty times 
in immediate succession, if correctly done at the first trial, 
may possibly make a deeper impression, but will have 
little effect in giving it a lasting hold. 
And when a page is read with ease, and perhaps re- 
peated without the book, though it may be of some use 
in teaching expression or as a subject for conversation, 
yet as a reading-lesson it has served its purpose, and 
should give place to something else. Its further use is 
rather to stifle thought, and make of our thinking pupils 
little else than prating parrots. 
Eyen upon the most enduring tablets the names and 
inscriptions become moss-covered and illegible, unless 
renewed at times by the mallet and chisel of some Old 
Mortality, and the lessons of our early school life, without 
an occasional recall, fade and escape us before the high- 
school examination; and, with a return in each grade to 
some preceding principles of the earlier grades, some new 
relation or application can be shown for which the pupil 
was not at first prepared. It is a frequent and sad mis- 
take to suppose that a subject must be completed at the 
first consideration of it. 
With the lower grades, too, as well as with the higher, 
an escape from monotony and a livelier interest may be 
secured by the magnetic attrition and generous rivalry of 
different minds. Not only in the saving of time and the 
multiplying of the teacher’s efficiency, but in the quality 
of the work, a class of ten or twenty is far better than 
one or two. ‘The wise teacher will seek, of course, to dis- 
cern and regard the peculiarities of the individual pupils, 
but individual instruction without the class is almost of 
necessity inferior instruction.

  44 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
The wealthy may employ the private tutor in the 
home, but at the sacrifice of the full-rounded training 
that results from the contact of mind with mind. The 
suggestions of another’s reading or recitation, the quick- 
ening of the mind, the alertness of thought in detecting 
errors, the skill and power of expression in making proper 
corrections, these are often quite as valuable as the teach- 
ings of the book, and poorly does the teacher appreciate 
the appliances of her art who allows the pupil after his 
own recitation to turn to some other branch while his 
fellows are reciting. 
Often a class of sixty even, in some kinds of work, 
derive as much benefit as if each were the solitary object 
of the teacher’s care. The very errors of his fellows will 
sometimes fix the correct principle in the memory, as his 
own study had failed to do. 
On some sample pages of a revised edition of ‘ Brown’s 
Grammar,” just received, I find: “‘The bird; The bird 
sings ; The bird on the tree.” ‘‘ Now,” he says, “‘ we are 
prepared for a definition of language.” 
For the advanced student, able to discuss intelligently 
the fitness of the definition, yes. For the young pupil, 
why? It teaches him nothing. He knows what lan- 
guage is as well as Brown. It is what he says; is talk. 
No definition can enable him to know any better. For 
the hair-splitter it may be a good test of his acuteness and 
ingenuity. ‘‘ Language,” says Brown, “is the expression 
of our thoughts.” What are thought and expression ? 
What relation is expressed by of? What if I express not 
my thought, but yours? What if I read or talk, as we 
say, without expression? Is it language? Does the 
learner know more than before? You have all heard of 
Plato’s man. 
The meanings of these new words are to be learned
-P-A-G-E-61
Te ee 
THE PLACE OF MEMORY IN SCHOOL INSTRUCTION. 45 
first by explanation, by employing them in various ways, 
but not by definition alone. No one becomes an elegant 
writer or speaker, or gets the nicer shades of meaning, by 
dictionary only. This is to be gained by thoughtful and 
varied reading of good authors, and by use and practice. 
But for the pupil in the primary grades let him get the 
correct idea, the thought, but not in set form of words. 
Let him learn no rules, no definitions, till he can make his 
own. Then he can memorize the best form understand- 
ingly. That only is to be learned by rote that is un- 
changeable. Extracts of poetry, and sometimes of prose, 
those crystals of thought that must remain, as pure, as 
durable as the diamond, may well be memorized and 
made familiar. 
When the pupil has become so well acquainted with 
most of the common words and their meanings that he 
can detect them at a half-glance, as he can his dog, his 
book, or his brother, and those ever-recurring forms, as a, 
the, of, to, for, and but, have almost ceased to seem as 
separate words; when his thought can run forward like 
an advanced guard ahead of his utterances, to remove all 
hindrances from his way, the memory is but just prepared 
to gather the richer treasures strewed along the route of 
his conquering march ; to grasp the thoughts that have 
been hidden within those mastered sentences, and to dis- 
tinguish the gem from the glittering gaud. 
Then may he take the thought from its old setting, 
and fit it to other uses; from the recorded deed detect 
the character ; from the plan, the secret purpose. 
‘We sometimes blame our children for reading books 
for the story, and yet, if the story be worth the while, 
is it not a high, a useful art? In the multitude of 
things to read, is it not a worthy aim to learn to gath- 
er and store up the best; to be able to give the sub-

stance of a page from a single reading, a close but rapid 
survey ? 
And in numbers, too, it would seem that in the earlier 
grades much of it is rather a matter of memory than of 
mathematics. 
The child of a year knows that he has more thumbs 
than mouths ; and at three, that a whole apple is more 
than a half. 
One, two, three, four, might just as well have been, 
zig, zag, pen, lun. The boy of six knows that this and 
that make these, the sum of the two; that ten and one 
are more than ten. ‘‘Nine and three?” ‘*Seven,” I 
fancy here is generally an ignorance of words rather than 
of numbers. Place nine pennies and three pennies before 
him, he does not choose the seven. 
I consider myself somewhat familiar with the alpha- 
bet, but it was not so long ago that I first learned to re- 
peat it backward, and should not feel sure of it now un- 
less I should repeat it rapidly. 
When writing this page, I stopped to ask myself what 
letter stands next before ‘‘I,” and found myself at 
fault, till I commenced above and followed down till I 
reached it. 
Ask the young learner what comes next after ten, and 
he answers five, not because he thinks ¢his is more than 
these, but because he has not memorized the words, the 
names for each. 
One and one, six and two, seven plus three, three 
from four, nine less seven, four plus five, six times three, 
two in eight, seem to me all memory, acquired by use and 
practice, practice perpetual to become familiar with the 
words, the names, and should always be verified with ob- 
jects till the correct understanding is gained. And learn- 
ing the multiplication-table is but memorizing the results

of additions. Itis much as it would be for us to learn the 
second letter after ¢; the fourth after m; third before u ; 
sixth before 4; fifth after 0. Drudgery ? Monotony ? 
I grant it—often the veriest essence of it, unless relieved 
and enlivened by some pleasing devices. No reason, no 
skill or ingenuity, but dull, dead, deadening monotony 
and drudgery. Fortunately, with our decimal system the 
monotony is limited, and after ten or twelve, at the most, 
we rise to a higher plane of mental activity, where reason 
and skill find a sphere for active employment and de- 
velopment. 
As in learning to read, so here the short but often-re- 
peated exercise, the small daily accretions, the introduc- 
tion of blocks, cards, any little objects, lines, figures on 
the blackboard, making the numbers the means to some 
end or purpose, some concrete problem—these and many 
other ways can furnish variety and pleasure. The multi- 
plication-table can, perhaps, be learned as quick, and pos- 
sibly quicker, by the simple memorizing of words without 
any objects ; but in the first attempts the words need to 
become so closely associated with the things that they 
shall be inseparable in the thought; that six shall be six 
some things. As the Concord philosophers would say, we 
need to “‘¢s” them, to ‘‘ thing” things. 
Beyond these elementary lessons arithmetic should be 
relieved of the bonds of routine. Analysis, brief, simple, 
free from vain repetitions and mummeries of words ; logic, 
clear, direct, the plain what? and what? and how ?—what 
have we ? what do we want ? and how do we obtain it ? 
Then should come practice, making familiar with the 
forms and methods of business, of daily life, how and 
what men buy and sell, the expedients by which credit is 
made available, and how the records of transactions are 
kept, the terms in daily use. But, let the subject be well

understood before beginning to formulate rules and the- 
ories. 
Use is the fresh fruit in its season, and formulated 
rules but the dried apples, the canned peaches stored up 
for the winter’s supply. 
Nor do the true sphere and function of memory be- 
come less important when we come to the study of facts 
and events, in what are sometimes called the information 
branches—those studies of man, political and social, found 
in history, and somewhat at least in geography : his prog- 
ress and development in the past, his industries and 
amusements, his life, his location, his condition, his mi- 
gration and conflicts, internal and foreign ; those studies 
where experiment and illustration are excluded, and dia- 
gram and apparatus superfluous ; where it seems all mem- 
ory, and too often proves all memorizing, pure and simple. 
But it should be remembered that names and dates, 
battles and revolutions, statistics and genealogies of kings 
and chiefs, are in themselves as worthless as the lives of 
most of the actors, except in their relation to some impor- 
tant principle, tending to the advancement or degradation 
of mankind; save as they stand as representatives of some 
grand movement or suggestion of causes, resulting in the 
welfare or misery of society ; something from which we 
may learn the paths that lead to success and well-being ; 
how we may better promote the freedom with the depend- 
ence of the individual ; cultivate the affections protected 
by the sanctity of the home ; and secure to a great people 
the intelligent and unobstructed pursuit of their own 
aims and interests, under the protection of a stable, 
strong, firm, just, and far-reaching government, resting 
upon the enlightened choice of the governed. We have 
yet to learn how capital and labor, those essential ele- 
ments of all growth, always associated, but, if out of poise,

always antagonistic and destructive, like opposite elec- 
tricities, may be balanced and blended into the perfect 
vitality of the highest health and happiness. 
For all the uses of history, the memory must grasp 
with retentive hold, not words but ideas, not forms of 
framed phrases but thoughts. 
There may be expressions so deftly combined that the 
very words are things to be retained as a joy forever ; but 
more often, in the effort at verbal accuracy, the pupil 
loses sight of the thought, and in a little time the recita- 
tion becomes but a meaningless repetition of unconsidered, 
undigested sentences. 
Mere words without the thought are but shadowy 
forms, and the effort to recall the fact is too often like 
the attempt of Aineas to embrace the shade of his father, 
when “Thrice through his clasping arms the shadowy 
image escaped him.” 
Nor is the fact learned in set phrase often available 
for future use. We learn one thing here and another 
there, but do not often wish to use them in the same rela- 
tions. 
Most of what we call originality of expression or of 
thought is but a rearrangement, a new setting, with differ- 
ent workmanship, for other uses. Perhaps, too, on a whole 
page there may be but one or two points of value for our 
present use, and far better than memorizing the page is 
the power to discern these points. The memory has its 
limits, and the amount of matter forbids the memorizing 
of all, and hardly can the pupil too early learn to cull 
from the unsorted mass what is suited to his purpose. 
Think of memorizing one of our morning papers, with 
a supplement! Yet no one can fail to find something of 
interest. 
In this direction should the instruction be directed.

Let the lesson be first gone over with the teacher, and by 
question and suggestion the leading points noted ; the dif- 
ficult expressions sometimes made plainer ; reference to 
other sources made ; the argument, or causes and effects, 
traced. 
Then may the pupil begin the study and preparation 
with definite purpose and success, and often but little 
more study will be required for parts of the lesson. In- 
stead of memorizing two or three hundred words, a half- 
dozen clear thoughts are to be fixed in the memory. 
And these are not be recalled by sheer force, but will 
be so related that the one follows the other by natural, 
easy suggestion. The first attempts to run the author’s 
round of words in recitation should be checked, and the 
pupil put upon an intelligent path. 
The rapid utterance, the indistinct enunciation, the 
expressionless (because unthinking) reproduction of an- 
other’s words, will with care soon give place to a clear, 
distinct, and thoughtful, though sometimes slow and 
hesitating, re-creation of the thought in his own words. 
Not only memory, but reason and judgment, taste in the 
choice of words, will have been exercised and cultivated, 
and the pupil takes his seat a stronger, better trained, 
and more accurate scholar. He has taken a step upward 
as well as onward ; his field of vision is broader and more 
beautiful, and far richer in its promise of the future. He 
has learned, too, to think while speaking, to meet his fel- 
lows with a manlier look, and is better fitted to perform 
the duties of a citizen in a land where clear thought and 
well-ordered speech are the seal of his birthright to re- 
spect and honor. 
Far pleasanter than the glib-tongued recital is that 
look of thoughtful effort on the pupil’s face during an 
occasional momentary pause in his recital.  
-P-A-G-E-67
THE PLACE OF MEMORY IN SCHOOL INSTRUCTION. 51 
In this way the few definite dates that are important 
in school life may be fixed with comparative ease, and 
they really are fewer than sometimes supposed, however 
the books may abound with them. Histories, like news- 
papers, are written for different classes and different oc- 
casions, and the paper that should omit the record of 
some base-ball game, with the errors made and runs earned 
by Jones or Brown, would fail of its purpose as truly as 
in omitting England’s doings in Egypt. And the many 
dates and statistics are not so much for present memo- 
rizing as for occasional reference. Who would care to 
know the exact date of the first settlement of all our 
States, or of the birth and death of all our Presidents ? 
Yet for special purposes any of them may be looked for 
at some time. The professor of history may fitly fur- 
nish his memorial storehouse with much that to me would 
be useless. 
A few grand central points may be fixed, and around 
them, by some association, clustered many others with 
sufficient definiteness for intelligent use. You might 
almost enumerate upon your fingers enough to place in 
proper perspective the whole outline of American or 
English history. As for the names of all the so-called 
early kings of England, we might as well learn the 
names of the commissioners of the hundred counties of 
Illinois. 
All history is related, and the parts should be studied, 
not as isolated facts, but in their connections now with 
this and now with that correlated fact, now in their re- 
semblances and again in their contrasts, now as causes, 
now as results ; like the parts of a picture, which, seen 
as a whole, can never be forgotten, but, cut out and ex- 
hibited each by itself, would be unmeaning and quickly 
lapse into well-deserved forgetfulness.
-P-A-G-E-68
52 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
Often, again, some striking incident or personal allu- 
sion, some anecdote or pithy remark, will vivify and after- 
ward recall the whole. 
In nothing, perhaps, more than in geography does 
that full understanding, that clear perception, without 
‘ which there can be no useful memory, fail of its realiza- 
tion. 
The very imagination of the child, which enables him 
so readily to grasp supposed facts, here often but inten- 
sifies the mischief. The ideas which he forms upon many 
subjects are often as wonderful as they are natural. That 
oft-told incident in one of our own schools, where a pu- 
pil had been told that ‘‘ The ox took the food into his sec- 
ond stomach and digested it,” which he reproduced at 
examination in the form that ‘It took it into its stomach 
and died yesterday,” is not an exaggerated example. 
What must be the mental picture of the pupil of the 
fourth grade, commencing the study of geography with 
those astronomical and metaphysical puzzles and conun- 
drums concerning the motions of the earth, the circles, 
zones, races of men, religions, governments, and stages of 
civilization, those broad generalizations and classifications 
by which the sages and philosphers are sometimes mazed 
and befogged ! 
Not much wonder that the little girl, after a fluent 
memoriter recital of these mysteries, upon being asked if 
she had ever seen the earth, promptly but very properly 
answered in the negative. 
Let the pupil rather commence with what he knows ; 
give him a starting-point where he can feel that he is 
dealing with verities, where he can verify his conclusions. 
His first geography-lessons may well be of the school- 
room, fixing localities, getting directions, learning north 
and south, east and west; let him plan it on his slate or
-P-A-G-E-69
  THE PLACE OF MEMORY IN SCHOOL INSTRUCTION. 53 
the blackboard. Let him then study his district, with 
some of its streets and prominent buildings. My own 
geographical knowledge has always been bereft of half its 
value from my early study of the map facing the south ; 
and to-day I have to make a mental conversion—the east 
of the map is always the west of the real world. The 
map of the world, the hemispheres, should always be pre- - 
ceded by the globe or some spherical object. 
More than one college-learned man have I seen caught 
by the very simple trap of asking him the direction of the 
north pole from Australia. 
Not much minute detail need be learned, or latitudes 
and longitudes memorized. With the fullest and most 
minute study the map must be brought out whenever a 
Franco-Prussian or Egyptian war is on the stage. Places 
start at once into prominence which had never found an 
assignment on the map. It matters not so much what 
form of words is used in this early school life. The clear 
conception of the things, the facts, is essential. And for 
this there are no other witnesses so credible and reliable 
as sight and touch. The object, the picture, the ball, 
map, diagram —all are to be seen, examined, made, if pos- 
sible. Then we may afterward be as careful as we will in 
the choice of our words and the forms of our definition. 
When memory shall take its proper place and our pu- 
pils be taught to observe, to think, to do, instead of to 
memorize and repeat, then will the growth of our pupils 
compel the respect of the wise for our schools, and the 
fruit of the tree of knowledge be for the sustenance and 
health of the people.

THE ELEMENTS OF GROWTH IN SCHOOL-LIFE. 
THAT memory should have played so prominent a part 
in our school-life is not to be wondered at, as it is, per- 
haps, the most important and mysterious of our mental 
faculties—the one faculty that makes all the others of any 
worth, binding by its infinite attractions the separate 
atoms of existence into one glorious whole, affording the 
possibility of a reasonable, intelligent life. Nor can the 
value of its marvelous powers be overestimated, nor too 
careful heed be given to its proper training and develop- 
ment. It is only the misapplication of its forces that is 
sometimes deplored, when, instead of acting as an all- 
pervading gravitation, molding the bright family of 
worlds and holding planets and suns in their harmonious 
circles, it would supplant the living principles of growth 
and progress, dragging the unvitalized star-dust of the 
mental universe down to a shapeless chaos of darkness and 
death. 
The first conscious act of the child’s awakening in- 
telligence is to observe—to see, to hear, to touch. How 
vague and shadowy the procession that passes over his 
tender sensorium! And yet these sensations are to be 
the alphabet by which the world and its occupants are to 
be revealed to him ; his reasonings and conclusions there- 
on shall constitute his wisdom; and the conduct to which 
they shall lead him be the determination of his useful- 
ness and the condition of his happiness. 
To observe, to think, to do—the three elements of all 
progress, without whose perfect blending all education 
must be sadly deficient and incomplete, and our best efforts 
illusory and ineffective—in what sweet accord they unite
-P-A-G-E-71
  THE ELEMENTS OF GROWTH IN SCHOOL-LIFE. 55 
during the early years, when the young being is adjust- 
ing itself to its new surroundings, and getting its powers 
of body and mind well in hand for the outreaching life ; 
and how ready the reward to his ever-delightsome efforts ! 
With no motive power but his own natural desires, no 
guidance save their speediest gratification, his advance, 
both in knowledge and power, might well put to the blush 
the maturer guardians of his later life. And if, upon his 
entering school, we are to be of service in leading him by 
wiser ways, it will be, not by checking his childish curi- 
osity, but by giving it a surer direction ; not in quench- 
ing any one of his desires, but in pointing to higher 
gratifications ; not by diminishing his happiness, but by 
helping him to make it more perfect and enduring ; not 
by calling a halt to his new-born powers, but by directing 
him how he may observe more accurately, think more 
clearly, and act more efficiently, because more wisely. 
But by the most earnest and well-directed efforts little 
would be gained, and we should all be but savages at the 
last, should we depend solely upon ourselves—could we 
not, on stepping-stones of the dead past, availing our- 
selves of the world’s wisdom, already won, rise thereon to 
greater heights. And where but to the written, the 
printed volume shail we turn for the best and fullest 
records, or where else make faithful minute of our own 
successes and failures ? Language—reading and writing 
—is the key that shall unlock the treasures of the past, 
and in the mastery of this will be found the chief employ- 
ment of the early school-life. 
But language is the expression of thought, and with- 
out this the ready calling of words is of no more worth 
than the twitter and chirping of birds, and from the first 
the two should always be associated—the thought suggest- 
ing the word, the word the thought, forever inseparable.

56 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
But, till the mind has somewhat furnished itself with 
ideas, hanging its walls with pictures, and storing its 
secret cells with abstractions for study and contemplation, 
the thought must come as a suggestion of the senses, those 
silent but watchful messengers waiting ever upon our 
waking hours to minister to our needs and pleasures, and 
making report of aught that may concern our welfare. 
Readiest to our hand comes the visible object—the hat, 
the book, the man ; then the easily recognized representa- 
tion, the picture, followed in due time by the arbitrary 
sign, the word, the name. Even now, too, may the in- 
terest of the pupil be quickened by letting him tell, in 
simple, easy word and sentence, what he has already 
learned, and leading him on to discover something as yet 
unknown to him—his little errors of speech by use set 
right, the strangeness of the school-room and the un- 
wonted sound of his own voice there made sweetly 
familiar, and his foreign lip soon beginning to curve in 
loyal lines. 
Now may he, by easy, quick transition, try to make 
himself the words; or, perchance, essay with unskilled 
hand his first attempt at art in the little picture of the 
hat, the book, the man. Soon will the apparent love and 
gentle sympathy of the teacher begin to be reflected in 
his own confiding face and glistening eye. There must 
be ever the thing to suggest the thought, the thought ex- 
pressing itself in words, the word fitly framed in the sen- 
tence, and made visible on the slate or page, and the sen- 
tence woven so as to produce mental pictures, like the 
changing kaleidoscope, ever fresh and new; thought 
again suggesting thought, making study an inspiration 
and labor a delight. 
At every step of his progress, even to make progress 
possible, there must be something new, some new arrange- 
 
-P-A-G-E-73
  THE ELEMENTS OF GROWTH IN SCHOOL-LIFE. 57 
ment of old material, something for the pupil to handle, 
examine, to find out for himself; something for him to 
think, to reason about ; something to devise, to invent, 
to do; some desirable purpose to accomplish. The very 
effort, which might otherwise be but the essence of 
drudgery and dullness, may, with a due motive presented, 
awakening his childish spirit, become like the glad motion 
of a new life. It is but the Dead Sea fruit of a perished 
and bitter past, the thought that labor, that work is and 
must be irksome. In the ardor of conflict the soldier is 
not conscious of the wounds he receives, nor any more 
does the student think of the toil, in view of the end to 
be attained. It is the aimless, fruitless, compelled toil 
that burdens and degrades, against which the free heart 
rebels, and which the weary drudge seeks to shirk. 
The motive may be a fortune to be won, a future 
home, or empty fame ; or, for the little ones, more valued 
still, and more efficient, a pleasant look of recognition, a 
kindly word, a well-earned commendation, or even the 
consciousness of successful accomplishment. If for one 
taste of the tree of knowledge our parents threw paradise 
away, surely for the banquet to which the wise teacher 
leads, these little ones will gladly seek it again. Toil 
for the sake of toil is not labor, nor suffering for the sake 
of suffering, martyrdom ; and subjection to unworthy im- 
position is not a desirable or useful discipline. 
When the pupil has advanced, as he will have done, 
perhaps by the end of the first term, so as profitably to 
use the book in reading, a new and fruitful field opens 
before him. The words that he has already learned stand 
out bright and clear, but in a different order, to tell him 
tales of new interest. Not now does the teacher need to 
stand over each, one by one, pointing with pencil or fin- 
ger at the unmeaning words, while the rest of the class  
-P-A-G-E-74
58 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
are gazing listlessly around, or covertly working out their 
roguish devices ; but as they already had gathered before 
the chart or blackboard, so can they now take their 
places, an interested class, pleased to apprehend the 
thoughts expressed in the well-known characters. They 
have the material prepared, so that instead of blundering 
blindly and hopelessly over the darksome way, they find 
the little mental pictures following in pleasing variety be- 
fore their minds, as they compass line after line. 
In telling of what they have read, they have no longer 
the trouble of repeating the precise words as read, for the 
familiar image is before them, and with an ever-increasing 
and more clearly-defined vocabulary, and more correct 
idiom, can they reproduce the story, as they would de- 
scribe an object or a picture presented to the eye. Now, 
too, they may be led to make their own little stories, or 
give descriptions of what they have seen ; by nicer per- 
ception to discern new qualities, or uses of articles in the 
room or at home, and ere long place them in visible form 
on their slates, converting their talks into veritable com- 
positions. 
That old bugbear of composition will soon disappear 
when we understand that it is simply putting on paper 
what we have made familiar by discussion or study, or 
perhaps what we have already said. Like that pointing 
with pencil or finger, to which I have alluded, many of the 
faults which we find it so difficult to remedy in after 
days and years, are faults into which we ourselves have 
led them by our early methods, or want of method. 
This clear perception of the thought is the basis of 
all their mental life. In the neglect of this lies the lack 
of expression in reading, so often noticeable not only in 
the lower but in the higher grades, and sometimes in can- 
didates for a teacher’s certificate. There isno expression,
-P-A-G-E-75
  THE ELEMENTS OF GROWTH IN SCHOOL-LIFE. 59 
because there is nothing to express. It is a mere calling 
of empty words and barren sentences. It is often a 
physical rather than a mental act, and even in that re- 
spect is little better than a failure ; for the absence of 
thought has left uncalled for the clearer, distinct enun- 
ciation, the nicer inflections and shades of meaning, 
which demand skill in the use of the organs of speech. 
Such an exercise dulls the perceptions, deadens the sensi- 
bilities, and dwarfs the reason, and returns the pupil to 
his seat a more inattentive, weaker, and stupider scholar 
than before. 
Nor does the evil end here. It has made the next 
lesson more difficult. What the pupil might have accom- 
plished with profit and delight, had the previous lesson 
been clearly understood, finding but an added inspiration, 
from his very habit of success, over the little hindrances 
in his path, now appears an insurmountable obstacle, 
from which his indolent nature shrinks unabashed. Nor 
yet have we exhausted the evil. Like all physical and 
moral decay, it spreads and perpetuates itself. Over the 
enchanting pages of history or biography, from which, 
with a thrill of joyous exultation, he should be able to 
extract the worth by a single perusal, he stumbles and 
blunders wearily and uninformed. And if, as in the last 
struggles of expiring hope, he essays with convulsive en- 
ergy the task with contracted brow and clutching his hair 
—you have seen him study—he begins: “That night, 
leaving his camp-fires ”—<“‘ that night, leaving his camp- 
fires ’—‘‘ that night, leaving his camp-fires”—<*‘ burn- 
ing to deceive the enemy ”—‘‘ burning to deceive the 
enemy ”—“‘ burning to deceive the enemy ”—‘“‘ he swept 
by country roads”—‘‘he swept by country roads ”— 
‘he swept by country roads”—‘“‘round the British ”— 
“round the British”—‘‘round the British.” Words!

  60 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
words !! words!!! Ask him now of Washington’s attack 
on Princeton. You can guess at the result. He has no 
idea that reading is study. 
This perfect union, this blending of the word with 
the thought, the sign with the thing signified, at the 
beginning does not come from the dictionary, but from 
use. It must, from its very nature, be essentially accom- 
plished before grammar or dictionary can be of any avail. 
And there can be no greater bar to success, no more deadly 
foe to real progress, than too early reliance upon either 
of them. A little book recently republished, written by 
a young Portuguese, is a good illustration of dictionary- 
learning, equaled only by some specimens from our own 
schools. The foundation must be securely laid in the 
familiar conversation, the examination and comparison, 
the question and answer, as the child has already so suc- 
cessfully begun to do in the home and on the street. It 
is astonishing how seldom the little Arab of the street, or 
the little cherub of the home, for that matter, ever mis- 
applies a slang word or phrase. 
And when he can read with some facility, then should 
come the supplementary book, or little pages, which he 
has not already learned by rote from listening to his elder 
brothers or the more advanced classes—something which 
has the same words employed in other relations, and with 
different shades of meaning. Not by reading and re- 
reading the same extract over and over again, till it can 
be said backward or forward, or either side up, with equal 
ease, nor by the long rhetorical drill, does the pupil learn 
to read. Not by telling him to give this or that inflec- 
tion or emphasis, or by parroting such and such tones, 
does he compass it. Find what he means by his reading ; 
why does he read so and so? With his own understand- 
ing, when he has any at all, he may be right, and, if
-P-A-G-E-77
THE ELEMENTS OF GROWTH IN SCHOOL-LIFE. 61 
properly taught, will rarely be in the wrong, however he 
may differ from you or me. The prattling tyrants of the 
household do not often err in inflection, emphasis, or in- 
tonation. When the word, by use and practice, has be- 
come itself an embodied thought, then we can pass from 
the concrete and imperfect to the abstract and ideal. 
Then may we claim companionship with the wise and great 
of the world and sit at the banquet of the sages, fur- 
nished from all ages and every clime with the science, the 
wisdom, the wit, and the poetry of which we can now be 
the appreciative partakers. Then, leaving the paths of 
error into which their feet unwittingly strayed, and care- 
fully shunning the false lights that have lured them on 
to danger and doubt, may we with safety and assured suc- 
cess direct our course toward the abode of a wise and 
noble humanity. 
The word, spoken and written, as the expression, the 
embodiment of thought, is the vitalizing element of all 
civilization and enlightenment, making each of us the 
sum of all, rendering each onward step secure, and fur- 
nishing in its records the foundation for further progress. 
In the beginning of all advancement, with its creative 
and preserving power, is the word, and without the word 
there is no accurate, true thought. 
Number, too—the motive and the measure of all ma- 
terial progress and the explanation of so many phenome- 
na—must be included in all true education. A happy 
day for society, as well as for the deserving teacher, will 
it be when the mentometer shall be devised of such deli- 
cate construction as to enable us to record and present to 
the public eye the quantity and quality of mental and 
moral growth and development, when our record-books 
can be read as easily as their ledgers. 
Nor will the value of the study of numbers be less-
-P-A-G-E-78
  62 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
ened when we shall rid ourselves of the old-time error 
that it is the true test of mental power—that he who is 
good in figures is good in everything. By trying to secure 
too much, we may lose our hold upon the true benefits to be 
derived. There are mathematicians and mathematicians ; 
some of sound judgment and intellect have I met, and 
some numerical cranks. In pure mathematics we reason 
from definitions, certain and unvarying, which, in the 
real world, in the contact of mind with mind, we never 
have, but deal largely with probabilities and presumed 
motives, where success depends largely upon knowledge 
of character, of men, and upon skill in forecasting re- 
sults. 
Not only facility in the use of numbers, but clear 
perception and sound judgment in obtaining correct data, 
and prompt, decisive, and skillful action, are needed in 
the affairs of life. Though mathematical has little in 
common with moral reasoning, yet the mathematical sense 
—skill in the application of numbers—is important alike 
to the banker and the artist, the astronomer and the poet, 
the musician and the housekeeper. Here, too, should 
the child’s early, his natural method be regarded. We 
should seek, not to obstruct and dam the sparkling cur- 
rent of the child-nature, producing but a stagnant marsh, 
or at best a dull canal, but to guide it in gradually deep- 
ening channels by a better way, through greener meadows 
and more flowery fields, not where it will be held barred 
and bound as by icy fetters, but with the sunlight playing 
upon its surface, making sweet music of its rippling mur- 
murs, ere yet it learns with calmer flow to bear the bur- 
dens of the merchandise and navies of the world. 
To observe, to think, to do, in sweet succession till 
almost blended into one, are still the threads of that 
golden cord by which the pupil is guided through the
-P-A-G-E-79
  THE ELEMENTS OF GROWTH IN SCHOOL-LIFE. 63 
mazes of ignorance to the light of intelligent life. Pleased 
with the rattle of the nursery, tickled, perchance, with 
the Kindergarten straws, with pleased fancy he comes 
now to the blocks, the buttons, the cards of the school- 
room. He takes them, he handles them, he counts them 
—combines, piles, takes down, separates, and arranges— 
learning his ones, his twos, and threes by short and pro- 
gressive steps. He learns, too, their names, and, in due 
time, the signs, the figures, and how to make then, till 
they become as familiar as his own face in the glass, and 
he has no more need to count them than to count his 
eyes or his ears. He may, perchance, vary his slate-work 
by little circles and triangles and squares, getting not 
only his addition, subtraction, and multiplication, but 
the alphabet of his geometry, too, before he knows that 
there is such a science as either. Nor would it be amiss 
sometimes to deck his slate with his attempts at men and 
dogs and birds, singly or in company, taking on drawing 
also as one of his unconscious arts. What squads and 
companies of those rude slate-soldiers have I drawn and 
drilled and slaughtered while sitting upon that board- 
bench in the old country school-house beneath the hill 
when I was thought to be bowing devoutly over my 
sums ! 
When this first year’s work has been now well digested 
and assimilated, and become as much a part of his mental 
nature as his last year’s dinner has of his physical, how 
naturally falls in that short-hand way of crowning the 
tens by putting them in the second place, in the king- 
row, as it were—the only royal way of learning! How 
these regal tens may lead their humble units during the 
second year of assimilation and growth! Little use have 
we here for those long lines and towering columns of fig- 
ures, as much beyond and above the pupil’s mental as

his physical grasp. And why waste much time or strength 
at all on numbers higher than millions ? They meet all 
the requirements of ninety-nine in a hundred of our busy 
men except in speaking of the national debt, and the 
naming of that conveys no meaning or impression save a 
general sense of greatness and vagueness. What oppor- 
tunities here as we advance to tempt the new-fledged 
souls to a trial of their powers—to give them a chance 
themselves to observe, to think, to do! 
If the old district school, whose glories are sung about 
as often and long as those of our mothers’ pies, had any 
superior merit it surely was not in its methods of in- 
struction, but in letting us alone to do our sums at our 
own sweet will. Yet in recalling those glad days we all 
forget the old rhymes : 
Multiplication is vexation; 
Division is as bad; 
The rule of three doth puzzle me, 
And fractions make me mad. 
  Not all happiness and courtesy even then, as is at- 
tested by the usual last-day refrain : 
Good-by, scholars; good-by, school ; 
Good-by, master, and you’re an old fool. 
But we may well imitate more often the old way of 
letting pupils do for themselves. Rainy days are the 
days for fishing, and why not, after one of those bright 
‘apple showers ” of the later autumn, cut a few of those 
apples into halves and quarters? A boy can count the 
number of halves as easily as that of wholes, and perhaps 
he may devise a way of writing to designate the halves 
and quarters. None but very young parents name the 
child before his birth. Without rule or direction let him
-P-A-G-E-81
          THE ELEMENTS OF GROWTH IN SCHOOL-LIFE. 65 
find out how many square inches in one face of his slate, 
perhaps by marking it off as a checker-board and count- 
ing the squares ; or, may be, by a higher flight, counting 
the rows and the number in a row ; the duller ones aided, 
perhaps, by asking them how many panes in a window. 
Let him compute how many yards of plain carpeting will 
cover the platform or the floor, making his own measure- 
ments ; how many of figured carpeting. He who suc- 
ceeds will need to learn no rule. He has already learned 
in the doing, and in a manner that shall remain. Let 
him draw the diagonal, dividing into two equal parts, 
and by a little observation and thought he has more of a 
triangle than is usually obtained from that old confusing 
demonstration in the geometry. Do something to quicken 
his dull nature, or, rather, to guide his restless, eager, 
longing nature into a thoughtful, persistent, and useful 
channel, and get rid of that everlasting, never-ending 
working of identical problems under some given rule— 
that burden and bane of so many school-rooms. 
Of course, the whole country is not yet subdued and 
possessed, but, following this pioneer work under skillful 
guidance, comes the steady tramp of the trained battal- 
ions, with ordnance and camp equipage, with stout hearts 
and strong arms, resistless, instead of becoming entangled 
in impenetrable jungles and mired in the morasses of the 
wilderness—their supply-wagons converted into an ambu- 
lance train for the sick and disabled, the tattered banners 
of the surviving few, if victorious at last, raised by feeble 
hands over a hospital of invalids. 
Especially is geography open to this intelligent work, 
affording opportunity for careful observation, from which 
is derived rich food for thought and reflection, leading to 
useful and educating action. In the school-room itself, 
with its rows of desks; the building, with its halls and

rooms to be measured and planned ; the adjoining streets, 
their width, and the length of the blocks; the presenta- 
tion of the district on the slate or the vertical blackboard 
—may be found the most important elements of the 
study. By the use of the sphere the cause of day and 
night may be easily comprehended, but not yet the sea- 
sons, with the long days of summer and the long nights 
of winter. Knowing the circumference of the earth and 
its revolution in twenty-four hours, the pupil may him- 
self determine how much passes under the sun in an hour 
or minute, and the difference in time between here and 
New York or San Francisco, and perhaps why the equator 
and its parallels and the meridians were devised. Possi- 
bly the county with its towns in outline would not be 
amiss, and the State with its chief features and towns. 
The crayon should be as familiar to his hand as the mus- 
ket to the soldier’s. 
Let him see how rivers are made, like the Mississippi 
and its majestic confluent, and the broad delta at its 
mouth. In the higher grade, when he shall read in 
“Evangeline,” for instance, “‘ How the mighty father of 
waters seizes the hills in his hands, and drags them down 
to the ocean,” he will see the difference between the sci- 
entist and the poet ; or, perhaps, how the poet must be 
himself a man of science; nay, rather a painter, a phi- 
losopher, a moralist, a linguist, as well, often seeing 
things beyond the scientist’s ken, evolving systems and 
deducing lessons of which he never dreamed. What 
vistas of delight might open before the pupil at every 
step, his only sorrow being that the time was so short ! 
The motive, the prime purpose of the public school, 
as may be seen from its origin and history, is intellectual 
culture ; and asad day for the people, as well as for the 
schools, would it be if this purpose should be essentially

changed, and they primarily devoted to the training of 
the laboring classes for their several vocations. From 
this intellectual culture the ingenuity and versatility of 
the American workman has become almost proverbial. 
He may not be in some departments so perfect a machine, 
but he is more of a thinking man. Half a century ago, 
when the bulk of the population were farmers and me- 
chanics, and their children were in the district school for 
three months in the summer and three in the winter till 
twelve or fourteen years of age, following with a term or 
two at the academy or select school, their studies inter- 
spersed with the various labors of the farm and the home, 
there was no thought or need of aught else. For the 
professional few there was the college, affording a little 
more Latin and Greek, but much less of science, than 
the present high-school. But the decided and rapid de- 
termination, within the last twenty years especially, of 
the young blood of the country to the large cities and 
towns—those centers of modern life—has changed the 
conditions, and, with all our talk of the new education, 
it would not be strange if we should seem to lag behind 
the marvelous movement of our civilization ; if, in short, 
as to meeting the requirements of the times, the old dis- 
trict school should be found fully in line with the schools 
of to-day with all their improvements. The merits of 
the district school \were little, but the demands were less, 
while ideal perfection would be counted among the short- 
comings of to-day, It is not in any lack of sympathy 
with the activities of the hour that we are in fault. The

cense-breathing morn,” and the jargon and clamor of 
court and forum drown the busy hum of honest industry. 
Mere physical labor the children of our schools and age 
may properly disdain as the lot of the ignorant and un- 
fortunate. But with the active brain we need to ally 
the discerning eye and the skillful hand, and to our ac- 
quaintance with books to add the knowledge of things. 
We must seek to furnish to our pupils something of that 
which the field and forest, the garden and the workshop, 
supply to his brother in the country. 
The three learned professions of our fathers no longer 
monopolize the trained intellect of to-day ; and in the 
ability to perceive, to think, to do, many a one whose 
academic escutcheon is all covered over with the heraldic 
devices, ‘‘ This certifies,” ‘*This certifies,” and ‘* This 
certifies,” must give place to his unlaureate neighbor. 
Aside from the field of mechanical invention and skill, 
the upheaval, as it were, of society in the line of deco- 
rative art—we can hardly call it a development—is open- 
ing many new channels of mental and manual activity. 
For all of these a correct training in drawing and design 
is the first requisite; nor is there, in fact, any depart- 
ment of business or professional life where its want is 
not felt. The use of the pencil can be as readily learned 
as that of the pen, and might well be as universal. 
But as the child can be pleased with the little simply- 
told tale ere yet it knows a word or letter; as in reading 
there should be some careful study of words, united with 
their ready and discriminating use—their only worth— 
so should the elementary lines and curves be interspersed 
with some picture-making, some attempts at shading and 
design. A fairly proportioned figure and a meritorious 
design may be accomplished long before the perfect 
straight line can be achieved. What kind of industrial

training could or should be made a part of our curricu-

this paper. One enthusiast is partially successful in this, 
and another in that; but just what shall finally take 
its place alongside of the reader and arithmetic still 
awaits the successful wooer. But, however this may be, 
we should seek by some means—a few of which it has 
been my purpose to suggest—to cultivate in our pupils 
,a quicker and more accurate perception; a clearer and 
closer logic; a sounder judgment; a nicer and truer 
taste ; a wiser forecast and more skillful adaptation of 
means to ends; how better to observe, to think, to do; 
to show him that, whatever his advantages, the true man 
is always a self-made man; that the highest acquisition 
is the full possession of all his powers of body and mind ; 
and in a free land the only wise ruler he who can control 
all those powers, and direct them to high and noble ends.

THE SCHOLARSHIP AIMED AT IN THE SCHOOL. 
TuE quickened interest of thoughtful minds under 
the impulse of what we are pleased to call the new educa- 
tion, finds its fullest expression in the discussion of new 
and improved methods. But methods are not for their 
own sake ; they are but means to an end, and the value 
of any instrumentality must be largely judged by the 
worthiness of the purpose which it is designed to accom- 
plish. It matters little how smoothly and swiftly the 
wheels of our machinery run or how generous the prod- 
uct they may furnish if the product itself be useless.

The purpose of the public school, as seen in its origin 
and history, is intellectual culture, and those methods 
only can have a strong and lasting hold on the public 
mind which best promote this. However pleasing and 
attractive the work may be, however we may for the time 
command the public ear and listen delighted to its words 
of praise, that system and those methods alone must win 
in the end and enjoy a lasting reputation, which continue 
to send forth their pupils with a better knowledge, a 
higher intelligence, a clearer understanding, a more thor- 
ough scholarship, than their fellows. 
Not long ago I was present at an exercise conducted 
by an accomplished and progressive teacher, the immedi- 
ate subject of which was the use of the tendrils of a vine 
in the pupil’s hand. After a satisfactory conclusion had 
been reached, the teacher remarked in closing : ‘‘I don’t 
care at all about your knowing the use of the tendril, but 
merely the proper method of investigation.” 
But, pleasing as the exercise had been, I could not 
help asking myself as I came away, What was the use of 
a proper method if there was nothing of value to be 
learned ; why build a good road, plated though it be, 
that leads nowhere, or the need of study at all, or the de- 
velopment of strength for such study when the knowledge 
to be secured is of no worth ? As Mrs. Browning so pa- 
thetically has it : 
. .. But that’s out of nature. We all 
Have been patriots, yet each house must always keep one; 
*Twere imbecile, hewing out roads to a wall. 
And, when Italy’s made, for what end is it done, 
If we have not a son? 
“‘Do men labor for that which is not bread, which is 
food for neither body nor mind? What encouragement

for future investigation when nothing of worth remains 
from our present pains ? 
The blessing of labor we admit ; but the arm is best 
nerved by the hope of the harvest, aud the growth of our 
powers is best served in the pursuit of that at which all 
our efforts aim at the last—the acquisition of knowledge, 
all that is highest, purest, noblest, best. 
The old talk of the threefold nature of man and the 
necessity of a full, complete development, barren of fruit 
as it sometimes seems in our schools, had become so fa- 
mniliar as to be almost a by-word a whole generation ago. 
Yet our schools were not established and are not sus- 
tained for the purpose of physical culture. Better to 
that end would have been the gymnasium, or a base-ball 
club, or in the country a turn with the shovel and the 
hoe. It is, of course, for the wise teacher to see that in 
the work of intellectual culture the health and physical 
grace of the pupil shall not deteriorate, making him with 
all his mental equipments but a bundle of bodily woes 
and weaknesses. 
Nor was it for moral training and the formation of 
character, except as the mental culture shall tend to that 
result, that the public school was instituted. Morals are 
not taught in fourteen weeks or in any number of stated 
recitations, but should be like the prayer of the Chris- 
tian : 
The teacher’s vital breath, 
The teacher’s native air, 
Her watchword at the school-room door. 
Her self-hood everywhere, 
that with bodily health unimpaired, strong in the integ- 
rity of a high and noble character induced by a cultured 
intellect and the habits of industry and self-restraint by 
which it may best be secured, our pupils without fear

and without reproach may go forth like true knights to 
battle for the right in the complete panoply of a true 
scholarship—a scholarship which, knowing the experi- 
ences of the past with its errors and failures, may be the 
better able to discern and follow the paths of honor and 
success ; a scholarship which, in so far as it has been at- 
tained, has ever been one of the most efficient agents in 
lifting men from the sloughs of idleness and degradation, 
dignifying labor and providing even for their idle hours 
the resources of happiness and noble virtues. For this 
intellectual furnishing we believe in the new education, 
though we ourselves were never guided by its smiles nor 
ever felt the enlivening influence of its wiser methods. 
Yet many of us can doubtless recall some individual 
teacher, some man, some woman, whose finer nature or 
truer sympathy has changed the current of our school, 
our world life, perchance, ‘‘made this and that other 
world another world ” to our wakened thought ; and we 
believe there is a new education, though there may not 
be and probably is not anything in it that has not in 
some degree been practiced by good teachers ever since 
schools began. 
We believe in the new education as we believe in a 
new tune, though it contains not a tone that was not in 
the old despised one. We believe in it for the spirit of 
humanity underlying, overlying it, inspiring it, which 
makes the living child its subject, its untiring study, its 
ceaseless hope ; for its truer appreciation of the child-na- 
ture in its restless eagerness, its longings, its love of na- 
ture and of life, and its ceaseless strivings to acquaint 
itself with its powers, its capabilities, and its surround- 
ings; and for the wiser presentation of subjects suited to 
each stage of its advance and development, skillfully 
guiding its unrepressed and gladsome activities into the 
 
-P-A-G-E-89
  THE SCHOLARSHIP AIMED AT IN THE SCHOOL. %3 
fruitful paths of experience and wiser satisfactions, turn- 
ing aside from the dreary waste of enforced drudgery 
into the fresh and flowery fields of earnest because curi- 
ous effort ; and we believe in it especially for the better 
understanding of things and their names, its nicer obser- 
vation of qualities and forms, its clearer conception of 
ideas, and its finer expression of thought, which tend to 
and constitute the beginnings of scholarly learning, learn- 
ing the meaning of things around them by handling and 
feeling them rather than from the dictionary, the defini- 
tions and power of familiar words from daily use rather 
than from the grammar. 
The active boy needs no geography to guide him 
through the nursery nor gazetteer to tell him of the con- ~ 
tents of his pockets or his playhouse ; but rather here does 
he gain those first lessons which make the dictionary and 
geography available in the study of things beyond his 
reach. 
In the six years preceding his admission to the school- 
room what has been the work of the child? He has de- 
veloped his physical, mental, moral powers, it is true, or 
rather they have been of necessity developed in his endless 
efforts to familiarize himself with the world he lives in. 
He has performed a task that few of us have the en- 
ergy and enterprise to accomplish ; he has learned a lan- 
guage in all its spirit and its life; has learned his moth- 
er’s, his father’s name, and the names of all the objects 
about him; he has early learned that fire will burn, that 
cold will freeze, and knows, beyond the power of Webster 
or Worcester to tell him, the meaning of burn and freeze ; 
and by many a bump has the force of attraction been im- 
pressed upon him. He has learned to distinguish the 
soft cheek and heart of his mother from his father’s 
roughly bearded face and rougher, sterner nature ; and
-P-A-G-E-90
  V4 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
his whole soul has been aroused to the love of knowledge 
and the keen pleasure in the pursuit of it, and not with- 
out a little thoughtful investigation can we realize how 
much of the valuable knowledge of objects around us is 
acquired during the first fifteen or twenty months. All 
these acquirements, too, have been made for themselves. 
No “constitutionals ” have called him abroad. 
His mind has been developed ; his character has been 
forming, and but too often beyond the teacher’s power 
to change it ; and his hands have been made obedient to 
his will ; but the tree whose fruit he has persistently tried 
to pluck has been the tree of knowledge. 
Nor is it for the simple training of his various powers 
merely or chiefly that he turns his strengthening foot- 
steps to the school-room door. In clearness and distinct- 
ness of vision and in keenness of hearing the red-man of 
our native woods surpasses our best results; his fleetness 
of foot but mocks our sluggish tread, and the tomahawk 
and scalping-knife impressively testify to his manual dex- 
terity and skill. His reasoning powers find exercise and 
expression in the hunt and the well-laid ambuscade, and 
to his ingenuity and shrewd devices his writhing victims 
bear tearful and truthful witness, while for his memory, 
the Indian, like the Bourbon, never forgets. 
He learns to do, in the only true way, by the doing, 
and does it well from age to age the same, but, like the 
Bourbon, too, he never learns anything. 
Of progress, that progress which, with the recorded 
experiences of the past as a basis, by new discovery and 
invention, is ever reaching outward and upward for other 
knowledge and higher learning, he knows nothing. In 
the skillful training of body and mind he sets a worthy 
example, but fails in the essentials of sound learning and 
scholarship.

It is said that the difference between civilized and 
savage life consists in the greater number of things that 
the civilized man possesses. The wigwam of the savage, 
in the advance, changes into the log hut; the hut ex- 
pands into a framed building ; the wooden frame, when 
buildings approach too near, is supplanted by brick or 
stone, which soon takes on graving and sculpture. While 
for the bearskin come the chair, the table, the sofa, plate, 
painting, music, until the poet’s dream is realized, 
And we see the narrow kitchen walls 
Stretching away into marble halls; 
The weary wheel to a spinet turns, 
The tallow candle an astral burns. 
So from stolid ignorance to enlightened power there 
is the sum of things known, of thoughts, ideas, inven- 
tions, science, art, and literature to compass. 
The beginning of each age being the accomplishment 
of all the preceding, the race continues its limitless ad- 
vance. The toiler of to-day is restless and unsatisfied 
with the luxuries, the attainments, the enjoyments which 
fulfilled the hopes of the monarchs and sages of yester- 
day. 
The sesame to all these wished-for possessions, to this 
progress, is found inscribed on the printed page, which 
keeps faithful record of each onward step, each true or 
false effort of the race, so that we are no longer compelled, 
like the Arctic voyager, to trace the same frozen and 
fatal route, feeding our own fruitless hopes, perhaps, 
upon the withered hearts of our companions, but leay- 
ing behind us all the vanished past, except its lessons of 
wisdom and its hoarded treasures, we push on toward the 
wished-for goal. 
Apart from its theological sense, in view of its in-

estimable value, we might almost say, as it reads, that 
all Scripture, all written record, is given by inspiration, 
and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, 
and for instruction. A broader and more accurate knowl- 
edge, a higher enlightment, a wiser intelligence, is the 
primary purpose and the greatest want of our schools. 
Education does not, we think, in its etymology or 
true meaning consist in a drawing out, a simple training 
of the mental powers ; but it is a leading forth into the 
world and into life, into a wider sphere, with an ever- 
firmer step, and larger wisdom what to avoid and what 
to choose. It is not the training of the athlete, who, 
with only Nature’s furnishing, by mere strength and skill 
seeks to win for the sake of winning, with no reward but 
the shouts of the ring and a few more disfiguring bruises, 
but rather the education of a Von Moltke, who, without 
superior bodily force, it may be, with all the appliances 
and improvements of modern science, with well-studied 
maps and charts of the country to be invaded spread out 
before him, with its rivers, its passes, its supplies, and 
defenses, and a thorough acquaintance with the charac- 
ter and designs of his opposers, can intelligently and 
promptly combine and direct the resources of an empire 
to the victorious accomplishment of his plans—a furnish- 
ing by the aid of which ‘‘one man can chase a thousand, 
and two put ten thousand to flight.” 
Where would the mailed crusader or the trained gladi- 
ator of the arena, with all their brawny growth, stand 
before this master of accumulated forces ? 
It is in this spirit of accumulation that the highest 
success and best progress of the school, the counting- 
room, or the cabinet consists, and by the want of it can 
we explain the emptiness of the efforts of an Abélard, 
with all his brilliancy and logical acuteness, and, we

sometimes think, of the endless questionings and hair- 
splittings and verbal perversions of a Socrates. 
The first step in the marvelous developments of modern 
science is the careful record of observed facts and phe- 
nomena. Effort without capital is wasted. So in school 
the first, the chief, work of the first year is the enlarge- 
ment and improvement of the pupil’s language, the at- 
tainment of a greater number and a more accurate use 
of words as the expression of facts and conclusions of 
thought, and only as the expression of thought, and gen- 
erally with reference to material things, such as can be 
verified by an appeal to the senses; thoughts and ideas 
necessitating a more careful examination of objects, as 
to size, form, color, sound, and use, enlarging his in- 
formation and quickening his perception for closer in- 
vestigation. 
No place here for the incorrect sentence to be amended, 
the imperfect sentence to be completed, the disarranged 
words to be formed into a sentence. Like letters to be 
formed into a word, they may serve as an innocent puz- 
zle for an evening’s diversion, but are apart from the 
work of the school-room, which should ever be the ac- 
cumulation of words for use, and useful thought and 
knowledge through the medium of words. From the 
more correct use of words in relation to familiar objects, 
and a nicer appreciation of their meanings and force, to 
be secured by child or man, not from dictionary, but from 
use alone, comes a wider knowledge of persons and events, 
their properties and relations, and perhaps some simple 
systematizing of his knowledge. 
Never talk for the sake of talk, but for better and 
nicer expression of thought, a clearer knowledge of the 
concrete as the sure and firm basis of the abstract, in 
order that imagination—that most fruitful of our facul- 
 
-P-A-G-E-94

ties—may not be the companion of grotesque fancy and 
wild vagary. 
When the words of our pupils in school shall be as 
clear and significant as they have been in their previous 
daily life may we hope that in these bright celestial urns 
philosophy shall not seem so dark a decoction to the com- 
mon mind, nor sweet poesy so rayless of sense as it often 
now appears on the pages of our literary magazines. 
For imagination is but the natural outcome of a more 
careful, a better learning ; though, if the young girl of 
nineteen were advised to cultivate the imagination of her 
pupils, she would, I think, understand anything rather 
than that. 
What is the opening of the twenty-third Psalm but 
the highest type of imagination? ‘The Lord is my 
shepherd ; I shall not want.” Why not my father, my 
guardian, my guide? Yet it was not strange for the 
weary, hunted David, with the picture in his mind of 
the little helpless flock, so dependent upon his care, yet 
resting so securely under the protection of him who had 
slain the lion and the bear, to exultingly exclaim, on 
waking from a moment of depression: ‘“‘The Lord is 
my shepherd ; Z shall not want. He maketh me to lie 
down in green pastures; he leadeth me beside the still 
waters.” 
No wrenching of the spirit here ; no racking of the 
mental constitution ; no strivings after the unattainable. 
It was simply the natural utterance of the knowing, 
trusting heart. 
A person untaught or but half-taught might have ex- 
pected the rippling, sparkling, bubbling waters ; but one 
who has ever known the longing of the weary soul for 
rest has not to wait long with the inquiry why the poet 
chooses the quiet, shady pool, from whose cool draughts

he rises full of refreshment and strength, ‘‘ He restoreth 
my soul.” 
So reliable a witness is sight, and so lasting the char- 
acters in which the records are written, that I believe 
the misspelled word, the imperfect sentence, the incor- 
rect statement should no more be placed before the pupil’s 
eye than poison should be mixed with his food or gun- 
powder given him for a plaything. And, if I mistake 
not the signs of the times, the day is not distant—is even 
now dawning—when our primary readers shall be filled 
with plain, simple, pleasing, correct, and instructive ex- 
pressions of thought in place of the senseless twaddle, 
the stupid inanities, and sometimes slangy vulgarisms 
pawned off upon a too-confiding public by the thrifty 
book-makers, evidently as familiar with the real child as 
with a good school. 
The pupil’s own errors should be set right, his mis- 
judgments corrected, his poor taste rectified, that he may 
clearly and correctly give full and free expression to true 
ideas founded upon a careful study of objects worthy of 
his best and lasting regard. Hardly can we overestimate 
the importance of this early habit of using words as the 
representatives of distinct ideas, and their proper arrange- 
ment into sentences for the plain expression of well-as- 
certained and clearly defined thoughts. Like the breath 
of heaven, it sweeps through the misty mazes of the 
seemingly dark and befogged brain, through which now 
the sweet light may stream, quickening dull thought 
into budding life, bringing a new sparkle to the luster- 
less eye, while over the heavy, sullen features softly creeps 
a smile of pleased intelligence. 
Right here in the beginning of school-life is laid the 
basis of success, and in the almost total lack of illustra- 
tive material in the past may be found the cause of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-96

irksomeness and barrenness of schools, in the uninterested 
use of but half-understood words, and the consequent 
memorizing of wholly unmeaning sentences. 
How many a boy or girl, the charm of the home cir- 
cle and the life of the playground, ready with his little 
story of play or adventure, at no loss to tell the number 
of his marbles or pet rabbits, can’t learn his geography, 
don’t understand his arithmetic, wants to be excused 
from grammar, never could write composition—oftentimes 
with his desk crowded with forbidden notes in answer to 
those he may have written ! 
He is interested in his rabbit because he caught it, and 
is soon familiar with its proper food and its habits, and 
will tell the story of his games undiminished to his chil- 
dren and grandchildren after him, but has no need, that 
he knows of, of his declensions and conjugations, can 
make no use of them—in fact, does not know what they 
mean. 
He can make and fly a kite, and does not soon tire of 
the pursuit ; but can not follow those old French and 
Portuguese adventurers, whose names he can not pro- 
nounce, and knows nothing of the seas and lands they 
visited, and can not remember them over a Christmas, 
to say nothing of a summer vacation. 
He is told that a certain word is an adverb, but would 
be just as well satisfied and unquestioning to hear it called 
a preposition or a conjunction. 
And how this indistinctness and uncertainty clings 
to later life till the whole subject seems but an incon- 
gruous muddle, and the books written upon it fit food 
for a bonfire ! 
Still, there is a grammar, a correct understanding and 
use of language, with names and terms enough for intelli- 
gent study, and it is fast finding its way into our schools ;  
-P-A-G-E-97
THE SCHOLARSHIP AIMED AT IN THE SCIIOOL. gf 
but it is the study of the language as found in good use, 
and not of misunderstood definitions—a learning to swim 
on dry land. 
These early acquisitions, like most of the studies of 
the school, are for use, and are, or should be, studied for 
their own value—little time is there in the public school 
for the study of those things not worth the knowing— 
that intelligent knowledge that can be used directly or 
as a means to other attainments. 
If we learn to do by the doing, we learn also to learn 
by the learning, and the best test of our methods of in- 
vestigation and leurning is the value of the knowledge 
we have learned or discovered. 
We are successful in our endless search for truth, so 
far as we find or learn what is true. We have no call for 
that truth that is true of nothing any more than for that 
goodness that is good for nothing, and the best mental 
discipline is promoted, with the consequent growth and 
development, as our powers are intelligently employed in 
the pursuit of whatever shall add to our valuable knowl- 
edge and highest wisdom. 
Of history, if rightly studied, of geography—descrip- 
tive, physical, mathematical, and political—there can be 
no valid question of their value ; nor any more, it would 
seem, of mathematics—number, form, size; nor of the 
sciences—some knowledge, and correct knowledge, of 
those things around us and within us, upon the sight, 
understanding, and use of which our own physical, men- 
tal, and moral well-being depends, with our highest 
health and happiness. 
Even growth is but another name for a greater ca- 
pacity for knowing and the power to satisfy that capacity. 
The perfect man must be not only the ready, but the 
full, the correct man. In making the man first and the 
7 
 
-P-A-G-E-98

merchant afterward, we are apt to get a worthless man 
and an unskillful, useless merchant. We would make 
the man in making the merchant—the broad, liberal, 
enterprising, upright, cultured, manly merchant, mer- 
chant prince, or princess, if she will. 
The empty, unfurnished developments are so apt to 
collapse just when their fullness is needed. It is not the 
bare fact, or rather the veriest shadow of a fact, the in- 
significant word, to be repeated to-day and forgotten 
to-morrow, that constitutes knowledge or intelligence. 
To learn that the capital of England is London, if the 
word be all, gives no information —any other name 
would do as well, as Bagdad or Tadmor in the wilderness ; 
or to learn that there are thirty-eight States, without 
knowing what a State is, as ready to give Canada or Chi- 
eago as Illinois. 
Our geographies, as it seems to me, begin where they 
should leave off. To the average beginner the reasons 
for supposing the earth to be round—the approaching 
ship, the shadow of the earth in an eclipse—can serve no 
other purpose than a more or less complete obscuration 
of his mental powers, in many cases never passing off, 
and even the circumference of the earth in miles might 
often as well be called feet or rods. We should begin 
with our familiar surroundings, till direction, extent, 
number have become a part of ourselves, never to be 
forgotten ; then outward to the city, the county, the 
State, with some knowledge of the nature and purpose of 
a city or State and the causes that conspire to make cit- 
ies. From lack of steam alone fifty years ago Chicago 
was an impossibility beside our sluggish stream. 
As with names of places, so with disconnected, unas- 
sociated events of history. From the painful expansion

useful return should come. As for the text, that Gen- 
eral Jones defeated General Smith, with so many killed 
and so many captured, if it end there, he might as well 
have bowled down so many pins or pocketed so many 
balls. But there were certain great movements for spe- 
cific purposes, of which these numerous engagements 
were but mere incidentals. There were reputations just- 
ly and unjustly lost and won ; and captures, of which the 
cost of the captured mules was not the only thing to be 
mourned, 
In truth, our whole war was itself but one chapter of 
the story of the great conflict of slavery coexistent with 
our Government, and can not be intelligently understood 
without that continuous record in mind. Instead of 
slavery, perhaps we might better call it the growth of 
liberty which began the trouble. Vices are always con- 
servative ; they do not desire reform. 
What matters it, too, to know that Adams and Jack- 
son were Presidents at such and such a date while igno- 
rant of the great political ideas forever at war in our his- 
tory and more or less faithfully represented by the parties 
that have from time to time combined and again dis- 
solved ? 
Again, our financial history might form an interest- 
ing and fruitful topic for study and discussion for the 
older pupils. 
It is wonderful the fruitfulness of asingle, well-learned, 
thoroughly comprehended idea, though of no more ac- 
count than the mustard-seed, that ‘‘smallest of all seeds.” 
But it must be a live idea and well grasped in a fruitful 
soil. Through one well-defined fact, as through a crys- 
tal lens, how all related facts come out clear and distinct 
beneath our steady gaze! The seasons and the zones, 
the extent of the zones and all their relations, need not be

studied and remembered if once the cause be clearly un- 
derstood. Even for definite knowledge, from the simple 
233° in the tipping of the earth, they all flow naturally 
and easily, with but a question in arithmetic not beyond 
the primary pupil to give the extent in miles if need be. 
The government of our city once intelligently known 
gives the essentials of all our State and national govern- 
ments, with a little enlargement of the picture by imag- 
ination. 
When the construction of the Hoosac Tunnel was un- 
der discussion, the venerable Dr. Hitchcock was called be- 
fore a committee of the Massachusetts Legislature to testi- 
fy as to the internal structure of the mountain. After 
making his statement in his simple manner, one of the 
doubtful members asked how he knew. Reaching his 
hand down into the pocket of his old fur-collared camlet 
overcoat, he brought up from its depths two or three 
small fragments of rock from the top or side of the 
mountain, with the confident remark : ‘‘ Why, here they 
are ; see for yourself.” 
Unlike a distinguished lawyer, a member of the Sen- 
ate about the same time, who, after an official inspection 
of some locomotive engines at the shops, innocently, with 
a graceful wave of the hand, inquired, ‘‘ Ah, do these go 
by water ?” 
The lawyer had had the better training and would 
have made the better speech. The difference was chiefly 
of information. One had studied for the sake of the 
knowledge and its natural deductions, the other for men- 
tal training and growth. 
One who has a complete knowledge of numbers from 
one to ten, or at most to forty or fifty—not in metaphys- 
ical distinctions, but in a simple, clear understanding of 
the thing itself—has little more to learn for the require-

ments of ordinary business save a few modes of applica- 
tion and the acquirement of a ready facility and accuracy 
by practice. 
When our books, or our schools, shall rid themselves 
of the cloud of witnesses to the efforts of book-makers to 
surpass each other, as seen in the multiplicity of useless 
terms—as causes and results, bases and effects, and I 
know not how many more—vwill the distressing subject of 
percentage stand forth clear and radiant in its various ap- 
plications as a rich landscape after a clearing shower. 
We desire our pupils to begin the study of numbers 
with the blocks, the buttons, the cards in their hand, 
botany with the blossom, the plant, and geology with the 
hammer, rather than the book—because thus only do 
they get the primary words, the alphabet, to under- 
stand the book with its definitions and descriptions—that 
they may not always toil along the same laborious ways 
that others have trodden with many an error and many a 
fall, but that with the lessons of others’ experience to 
guide them they may quickly and more easily possess 
themselves of the land already discovered, and perhaps 
press on to new fields and broader conquests. Thus only 
is it possible that 
. . . through the ages one increasing purpose runs, 
And the thoughts of men are widened with the process of the suns. 
In the shop, too, the definitions of geometry, me- 
chanics, and physics can be learned with a value the text- 
book can never give. From the table, the work-bench, 
and the forge, comes a living, fruitful meaning, with a 
fullness beside which the explanations of the book alone 
would be but withered shreds. 
The study of language, of grammar, too—for, as I 
have said, there is a grammar of the English language,
-P-A-G-E-102
    86 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS, 
even in default of the accident of inflection, a study that 
teaches to speak and write correctly—this, too, in its 
beginnings, like numbers and science, should be object- 
ive, the study of the language as it is found in good use 
by authors, and its correct and ready employment in ex- 
pressing the thought of the student. Nor till a consid- 
erable familiarity with its structure and spirit is at- 
tained is the pupil prepared to formulate and define, that 
work of the advanced and skillful student. 
And instead of testing his progress by defining prop- 
erties and repeating tables and columns, let him be asked, 
if you please, to give 4 good description of the room he is 
in (or take some like familiar topic), a reliable and ap- 
proved method of examination, showing both what he has 
learned and what he can do with it. An examination 
may or may not ascertain the pupil’s acquirements and 
power, and so may the daily recitation. 
It is not difficult to suppose a recitation so conducted 
that a perfect record would afford little or no proof of 
any valuable knowledge gained or power acquired which 
would be available for future use. In this connection I 
would suggest that the practice sometimes observed of 
giving five or ten minutes for sttidying a lesson in spell- 
ing, history, or any branch of study in immediate prep- 
aration for recitation is injurious, and only injurious, 
and in its tendency ruinous to that retentive memory, 
without which the highest success is impossible with the 
scholar, the teacher, the business man, or the politician. 
A few minutes given to quiet thought, for recalling 
the important points of a subject previously studied, but 
thought without reference to the book, would cultivate 
.a kind of memory of the first importance—one of the 
most efficient factors in all growth and progress. 
And even in the grammar grades may our pupils ex-
-P-A-G-E-103
  THE SCHOLARSHIP AIMED AT IN THE SCHOOL. 87 
tend their knowledge to the common figures of speech 
as found in the authors read, so as to appreciate their 
beauty and force, and to employ their familiar names of 
simile and metaphor, and to make a fitting use of them 
in their own writings and speaking. 
For its value to themselves they should know what 
constitutes verse, and what poetry and rhyme, and be 
acquainted with the common forms of verse so well as 
almost without an effort to apprehend the delicate rhyth- 
mic movement, in true enjoyment of the fitness of this 
or that form for its special use—an acquisition as easy, 
as pleasing as song. 
And J would not discourage the young, half-fledged 
soul from trying its light pinions in airy, tuneful flight, 
nor mock the weak attempt. A sorry swain is he who 
never feels his fond heart swell with airy nothings, to 
which he fain would give a local habitation and a name. 
The form that is always content to creep is but a reptile, 
and dust, by just decree, his food. Even Tennyson’s 
early lines would not have kept Alcibiades awake. 
With all our science and art, the good things of life 
are not all material. The marble column, the rounded 
dome, the frescoed wall, have no meaning or form to the 
untaught mind. In the richer thought, the more grace- 
ful expression, the sweeter melody of a truer, purer litera- 
ture, the foundation and adornment of the modern home, 
is found their only right to be; and the effort of the 
young soul toward the attainment and use of the best 
within its reach is well deserving of encouragement. 
In the oft-quoted line, ‘‘The curfew tolls the knell 
of parting day,” is found more of history, more of poli- 
tical, of social science, more of poetry, of language, than 
the majority of our graduates take with them from the 
grammar or high school—a statement in which I believe

  I do the wisest of you no wrong. Very much of this 
most valuable information may be secured, with a wise 
teacher, incidentally and almost unconsciously, in a way 
that, far from interrupting the stated work, only seems 
to give it a new, a real interest and life. 
» Yet so apt is any useful method or new invention to 
be regarded, like a new mineral water, as the panacea for 
all ills, and praised beyond its true use, that our graded 
system, with all its power for good, has often been so 
straightened and narrowed that the mind and heart, that 
the whole nature of the pupil and the teacher has been 
cramped and stifled within its ever-tightening and be- 
numbing grasp. 
In utter neglect or forgetfulness of securing what is 
already gained, and of introducing into each grade some 
principles of each preceding grade in some new relation, 
that nothing be lost, a line of demarkation and exclusion 
between the different grades has been drawn more rigid 
and more rigidly enforced than the cholera quarantine of 
Europe. 
Subtraction has been neglected in the pursuit of 
multiplication, and arithmetic has been buried beneath 
the unknown quantities of algebra. On the portals to 
any information not outlined for the particular grade has 
been posted the red or yellow sign of contagion—conta- 
gion of intelligence not needed in that grade. 
And, finally, so brief is the life of school at best, and 
so little its achievements, that our highest aim should be 
to create a hunger and thirst for all true knowledge, to 
inspire a love of all useful learning, ever looking with 
the hope, the faith of childhood, nay, with the assurance 
of manhood, to the fulfillment of that noblest reward of 
our efforts, when we shall no longer see, as through a 
glass darkly, but then shall see face to face; when no

more shall we know, as now, but in part, but in the 
highest presence shall know, even as we are known. 
VIL 
THE TEACHER IN THE SCHOOL-ROOM. 
In this work of ours, whatever be the theories we 
may evolve or the methods we devise, the result is to be 
wrought out in the school-room. In the school-room is 
to be found the test of their worth, the truth or untruth 
of our philosophies. In the quiet study, indeed, must 
the facts and suggestions of life be deeply conned and 
considered, old systems changed and new ones formed ; 
but in the school-room are best studied those nerve-cen- 
ters of educational life whence our richest experiences are 
to be drawn and where our best laid plans are to meet 
their condemnation or reward. 
It is not the recluse with his abstruse thought and 
pure reason, nor the philosopher with his broad general- 
izations and logical deductions, nor yet the statistician 
with his cold columns of recorded data, who is to work 
out the true problem of school-life, but by the keenly ob- 
servant, thoughtful teacher in the school-room, in closest 
relations and deep sympathy with the living child in his 
eagerness and restlessness, his waywardness and trustful- 
ness, are to be studied the changeful phenomena whose 
true apprehension shall give him assurance of success. 
Noble as our work is accounted, and assuredly should 
be, yet it consists largely of little things. No great 
events or glaring deeds are to herald the good teacher’s 
success and urge him on to renewed efforts, nor has he

the ready means by which to judge of the results. The 
farmer may measure his products, the merchant sum up 
his profits or his losses, and the broker count his gains, 
but how little can we see at the close of the day or the 
week of our work! We have compassed so many lines, 
so many pages, it may be, but what has been done for 
the pupil’s growth, the development of his powers, for 
his integrity or his real intelligence, what toward giving 
him a true direction in life? A large faith, a great hope, 
a faith in childhood, a hope and trust in earnest, faith- 
ful, well-directed effort, an enduring love of the service, 
must be the essentials of the deserving teacher, the first 
elements of fitness for the school-room. 
With what joy and pride and sometimes awe does the 
little six-year-old make preparations for his first day in 
school! It is the goal on which for weary days his swell- 
ing heart has been fixed. Morning after morning has he 
anxiously stood to see his older companions pass in noisy 
groups and turned tearfully away with the feeling that 
the sluggish hour would never come; and now he, too, 
with his new shoes, perhaps, and mended coat, is to enter 
that mysterious portal. And there at the threshold, like 
a fairy princess, should stand the sympathetic teacher, 
with smiling welcome to receive him, to crown his hopes 
with her sweet confidence and kindly care, and assign him 
his seat, the throne of his childish ambition, and his 
desk, the banqueting-table of his curious and wondering 
heart. 
Fortunate, indeed, is the pupil on whom this new life 
shall never pall, and favored with the choicest gifts the 
teacher who shall give to this new relationship an ever 
stronger and more enduring bond, that when the strange- 
ness, the novelty shall pass away, it shall give place to an 
attractive charm, that for the welcoming fairy, by a sweet

transformation, shall now stand the kind friend, the wise 
counselor, the trusted guide, the respected teacher. The 
needful restraint of the school must be relieved by its 
cheerful enforcement, the tiresome monotony enlivened 
by a pleasing variety, the eager curiosity preserved by 
presenting ever something fresh and new, something to 
discover and learn. 
For his activities new channels must be opened, some- 
thing given him to do, to represent, to make, that in 
place of those weary hours of enforced silence and dull 
quietude we may find the pleasing signs of orderly life, 
of directed energies, and well regulated growth. Though 
the school-house is not a play-house, nor school-life play, 
it may be none the less enjoyablee Excellence in govern- 
ment is no longer measured by the test of folded hands 
and slumbrous stillness. The change from home-life to 
school-life is great enough at best, and the first requisite 
of the teacher is the power so to control and guide the 
pupils along the paths of learning, so to place before 
them objects of interest and usefulness that the unthink- 
ing joy of their entrance upon school-life shall change, 
with their expanding powers and clearer aims, into the 
deeper satisfactions and more earnest thoughtfulness of a 
wiser intelligence and larger nature, that our pupils, in- 
stead of dropping away disheartened one by one, like the 
deserters from an unsuccessful army, may with courage 
kindled to enthusiasm advance to each new grade or 
study with the ardor of assured victors. Even were the 
school but an agreeable resort for the child, where he 
might be watched and tenderly cared for, safe from the 
evil influences of the street during the parents’ busy 
hours of toil, it would not be wholly in vain; but he is 
here for a still higher purpose, as was just suggested. 
He is here to be instructed, educated, lifted to a wider
-P-A-G-E-108
92 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
intelligence, with firmer purposes and truer aims. He has 
thus far been trying and learning of his powers of body 
and mind and familiarizing himself with his surround- 
ings, as chance or desire has led him on, turning from 
this to that, from plaything to pet, from pet to floating 
butterfly, beginning some plan only to leave it for some- 
thing else, as his varying mood or heedless impulse has 
directed. 
Now must he learn to study things more closely and 
consecutively, to pursue some plan more persistently— 
take reason in place of whim for a guide. He must learn 
to submit to the leadings of others in those untried paths 
where his untaught steps would carry him astray. Now, 
little by little, must he learn the power of well-directed, 
continuous effort, resisting the call of pleasure or passion 
to draw him aside. Now, too, must he begin to learn 
what others have said and done, and how the record has 
been made and preserved, and how to record his own 
thoughts and experiences—that marvelous art by which 
the deepest thought, the most delicate sentiment, the 
highest truths and most profound philosophies, may be 
spread out in visible form and made our own. 
Within what a narrow circle would our lives be run 
were we shut up to the paltry measure of our own seeing 
and doing! The key to a wisdom, power, and intelli- 
gence beyond the accomplishment of centuries by their 
own unaided doings has the child who can read under- 
standingly ‘This is a man.” 
For this work a teacher can hardly be too well prepared. 
How often are we reminded that no great amount of 
scholarship is needed to teach the first reader and instruct 
in number from one to ten! But it is not the mere call- 
ing of words or the summing up of twos and threes with 
which she has to do.
-P-A-G-E-109
  THE TEACHER IN THE SCHOOL-ROOM. 93 
Even here the clear enunciation, the easy utterance, 
the pleasing tone, the unaffected grace of the pupil, will 
appear only as the reflection of these in the well-trained, 
well-informed, cultivated teacher. Even here in the 
earlier grades, and perhaps here more especially, a famil- 
iar knowledge of both physical and mental physiology is 
needed—a ready knowledge of the right uses of the vari- 
ous powers of body and mind, and the laws of their 
growth and development, and by what slight causes they 
may be distorted, and their healthful unfolding arrested 
or retarded. A recognition of the diversity of mental 
and moral as of physical features should belong to him 
who makes teaching his special work. 
In the physical world, the earth, the rock, the tree, 
the plant, the flower, the fruit, the beast, the bird, the 
fish—what illustrative material is found for the lower as 
well as the higher grades, combining the sweetest pleas- 
ure with the highest use! Surely the elements of geol- 
ogy, botany, and zodlogy are not beyond the teacher’s 
needs. 
And what a power from the first to the last has she 
who has at her command the graphic art, the use of 
crayon and pencil ! 
Not as an ornamental branch, a pretty accomplish- 
ment, does it come to the school-room, but as an essential 
part of all good work, enchaining the almost infant mind, 
illuming the pages of history and geography, and mak- 
ing the study of the sciences a possibility. 
We talk much and often of the study of the child- 
nature, its powers and its susceptibilities, but this is no 
new study ; it has claimed the attention and commanded 
the best thought of sage and philosopher, and little ad- 
vance will he make who comes to the consideration of 
the child-life with no knowledge of results already reached,

«‘There were kings in Greece before Agamemnon.” As 
well might the student in astronomy disregard all the 
| past, and begin anew the old star-gazing of Chaldea, 
| without even the aid of smoked glass, as the young 
teacher turn from the writings of those who have made 
teacher and teaching a life-study. Phenomenal as the 
| first child is in a young household, the pupil at school is 
not like a new comet, whose elements must all be calcu- 
lated anew. Rarely does a disease appear or accident 
occur whose like is not recorded in the books. 
One who has never taught learns little from visiting 
| another’s school in comparison with him who there sees 
his own errors in a new light, and finds methods and de- 
| vices for which he has sought in vain, and which he may 
put to a wiser use in increasing his own efficiency and 
worth. 
And without a familiar acquaintance with the studies 
and results of some of the past leaders of thought and 
, adepts in practice, poor and unfruitful will be the young 
and unskilled teacher’s explorations into the mysteries 
of the child-nature. Errors have been made which need 
not be repeated ; methods tried and found wanting which 
have no present place, save in the museum of the anti- 
quary. 
But with the well-studied chart of past experience 
and the compass of well-established principles before him, 
with a watchful and discerning eye and a firm and steady 
hand, may the true pilot bring his craft with its precious 
freight through changeful seas, ’neath varying skies, past 
sunken rocks and treacherous sands, to the safe harbor of 
the destined port. 
And, perhaps, no period of our history has been more 
keenly alive to the importance of right aims and means, 
or been richer in wholesome result, than the present.

These daily records have not many of them yet reached 
the formal volume, and are to be found only in the in- 
telligent journal and thoughtful magazine, not to be 
ignored by him who would be in the line of present 
progress. 
But it is not every new method that is to be adopted 
before putting it to the proof. People in haste to descry 
the new prophet may cry, “‘ Lo, here !” or “ Lo, there !” 
but the end is not yet. Prove all things intelligently, 
and from the poorest teacher we may often derive aid and 
valuable assistance. 
It is at least curious, if not instructive, to study the 
lives of educational reformers. How many of us are 
familiar with the life and work of Pestalozzi, the father 
of object lessons and language work, the two great ideas 
of to-day? No more unpractical man, perhaps, ever 
lived. At school he was ‘‘dubbed Harry Oddity, of 
Foolborough,” and school-boys often show an instinct 
before which the wisdom of age may bow in lowly rever- 
ence. After trying a profession and business with no 
success, he turned to school-keeping, and it is perhaps 
well to note how often an utter unfitness for any other 
calling is regarded as conclusive evidence of a call as 
. teacher. 
The history of education presents no more lamentable 
failure than his. Never could he keep a school together 
for a year. 
After a score of years of poverty and despondency, he 
wrote, among other things, a novel, upon which his repu- 
tation depends. Other things he wrote of no worth, and 
again was driven to the last resort of teaching, but to no 
other purpose than to prove, as he himself says, “his un- 
rivaled incapacity to govern.” 
Nor was Froebel much better. His prime idea of
-P-A-G-E-112
  96 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
‘the spontaneity of the child” could hardly lead to any 
end but confusion and failure. And yet from these 
wrecks have been saved some of the most fruitful theories 
of to-day, gathered and systematized by more practical 
workers. 
But educational works are not the only or, it may 
be, the most important part of a teacher’s outfit. A 
wider culture must he seek who would most benefit his 
pupils. Narrow, indeed, must be the study, the thought, 
the heart of him who goes not beyond the dry and beaten 
path of text-book and school literature. 
Text-books are but mere guide-posts, pointing the 
way to the inexperienced teacher, but giving little knowl- 
edge of the wood, the field, the country through which 
he passes ; or, changing the figure, they are but skele- 
tons, suggestive of what might have been, but leaving us 
as ignorant as before of the life and character, the work 
and worth, of him whom they had upborne. Little has 
he of grammar, of language, who, planting himself upon 
the text-book, is not read, and well read, in the works of 
those who are skillful in its use, familiar with their nice 
expression, their delicate shading of thought, and their 
clear and distinct utterances. 
In the reading circles that to-day are forming all 
through the land, as I look over the lists of books, I seem 
to see too much of this narrowing tendency of our work, 
too much mere text-book study. Better, it seems to me, 
would be the little gathering or club whose members 
should meet to study Longfellow or Tennyson, Haw- 
thorne or Shakespeare, Motley or Green, comparing 
thought with thought, exciting by the attrition of mind 
with mind a living magnetism, through whose influence 
life should be infused into the otherwise dead forms of 
expression.
-P-A-G-E-113

THE TEACHER IN THE SCHOOL-ROOM. 97 
School-life, unless thus enlivened and broadened by 
literature and science, by mental contact, is a narrowing 
life, as that life must be that forever closes in and in upon 
itself, busy always with minds narrower and weaker than 
its own. 
I have dwelt thus upon the qualifications of the 
teacher because here, as it seems to me, lies the strength, 
the hope of our schools. If we are to throw off the be- 
littling bondage of text-book, and reduce it to its proper 
place as a ready aid and suggestive guide to our pupils, 
we must, by a wider range and a larger comprehension, 
possess ourselves of the subjects; we must clothe the skele- 
ton with muscle and nerve, and breathe into it the breath 
of life. 
If we would teach our pupils to examine thoughtfully, 
to collate, compare, and judiciously decide, we must give 
them an opportunity to present their views, discussing 
with them their conclusions, meeting their criticisms and 
wrong deductions, not by our mere arbitrary dicta, but 
by more convincing arguments, wise enough, too, to con- 
fess our own errors when in fault, without attempts at 
unworthy subterfuge or feeling of humiliation. 
Very little of the logic of mathematics does a class 
receive from a teacher with whom a key is a necessity. 
This earnest, vigorous thought, this honest endeavor, 
the tracing of the relations of causes and results, induces 
a love of truth and right which we call virtue—the in- 
tegrity of purpose which we call character. Thoughtless 
submission to unsupported authority is not character, 
nor heedless innocence, of necessity, morality. It con- 
sists rather in duty known and performed, that which is 
due to ourselves, as thinking beings, and to our fellows ; 
and with this knowledge and performance on the part of 
our pupils the teacher has much to do.

98 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
The larger thought and broader culture is needed to 
burst the wrappings of that ignorant self-conceit, whose 
ever-thickening and hardening folds withhold the growth 
and crush the life out of the tender germs of all that 
is generous and good, leaving us, as literature has been 
so fond of representing, but withered, crackling husks, 
with little within but dust and fruitlessness. 
But not with the entrance upon the teacher’s life in 
the school, with certificate signed and secured, is this 
preparation to end. Most of our teachers enter upon the 
work at too early an age to have had any extended read- 
ing or careful study beyond the requirements of the class- 
room. 
Every day should add something new to the outfit 
of the teacher. From the first day with the primary 
grade to the last of the high-school or the college the 
teacher who would succeed can not safely neglect special 
preparation for the day’s work, ever seeking for some 
means for securing a closer sympathy with his pupils, 
some way of presenting the subject more naturally and 
more efficiently, some new illustration, some truer aim, 
some higher motive. 
And with every day and every exercise should he 
enter upon his work with a distinct and clearly defined 
purpose, a full comprehension of what he designs to ac- 
complish, a comprehension of the pupil’s past achieve- 
ments, and the true relation of his present performance 
to his future progress. He is not merely to adapt him- 
self and his teachings to the chance mood or caprice of 
the pupils, but thoughtfully and skillfully to control 
their undisciplined, untamed thought, and lead it almost 
unconsciously into the well-considered and directed chan- 
nel of his own purposes. 
Were the spontaneity of the child alone to be consid-
-P-A-G-E-115
“THE TEACHER IN THE SCHOOL-ROOM. 99 
ered, he had better have remained at home teazing the 
cat, impaling the fly, or digging in the sand. 
If to-day is frittered away in aimless effort, there is 
no basis for the work of to-morrow, and the morrow finds 
teacher and pupils all adrift upon an unknown sea, the 
bearings lost, the log untried, their bark forced far from 
her true course by unseen currents, with no approach to 
the desired haven. 
This fixedness of purpose, this definite aim in the 
teacher, can hardly be too strongly urged—this making 
each day’s work but a stepping-stone to the work of the 
next. Disconnected facts are of little avail in education. 
There is a logic of events, as of life, and it is only in 
their true relation that many of the incidents of life and 
of history are important. 
Illustration and embellishment are valuable only as 
they awaken a new interest, fix the attention, and bring 
out more clearly the points under consideration. Only 
the philosopher can wholly discard them and deal with 
plain, unadorned expression of pure thought and reason. 
But how often are the illustrations allowed, and by the 
more scholarly, too, to divert the mind of the pupil from 
the real object of thought, distracting his attention, and 
obscuring that clearness of mental vision which should 
be the aim of all our endeavor. 
I recall an exercise in reading in which Naples was 
incidentally introduced. This suggested its beautiful 
bay and the neighboring voleano. What more natural 
than to recall the exhumation of that old Pompeian vice, 
question following question, leading to the excavations 
at old Troy and the reality of the Trojan war and the 
personality of Homer. Whether Shakespeare and the au- 
thorship of his plays and sonnets were to follow, the brey= 
ity of time and this life would not permit me to learn. 
 
-P-A-G-E-116

But I had heard no reading. Perhaps some thought 
had been started, some information gained, some pleasure 
afforded, but it had not been a reading-lesson ; the in- 
formation was all desultory and ineffective ; the thought, 
as I felt, had been squandered, the reason enfeebled, the 
whole purpose of the exercise missed, for which sad re- 
sults the doubtful pleasure could be but a sorry compensa- 
tion. Might they not as well have been observing the 
changing pictures of the kaleidoscope, with as fair a pros- 
pect of any worthy results either of discipline or intelli- 
gence ? 
In the treatment of any given topic by the author, on 
every page there is much that is comparatively unimpor- 
tant, much whose importance depends upon the compre- 
hension of the pupil. It is the essentials that should be 
made clear and indelible, and, if these are thoroughly 
grasped, the explanations and illustrations may well be 
lightly passed. 
With a definite purpose in the mind of the teacher, 
and the desire, too, to induce the habit and the power of 
connected, logical thought in the pupil, the same event 
may often be considered from different points, and in its 
relation to different subjects. 
The character of an administration may be studied in 
its bearing upon our foreign relations, with regard to our 
internal policy, or with reference to the relations of the 
different States, requiring in each case its peculiar col- 
location of acts and events, with varying importance as- 
signed to the same act or measure. 
One of the great objections to memoriter recitations 
is that they leave the relative importance of facts and 
events entirely out of view, giving as much emphasis to 
the scarlet and purple of Sir Edmund Andrus as to the 
skirmish at Lexington or the surrender at Yorktown.
-P-A-G-E-117
THE TEACHER IN THE SCHOOL-ROOM. 101 
And even a topical study and recitation from the same 
long list of topics upon the blackboard for each and every 
State and country is open to the same objection, the 
Thames, with the wealth of the world upon its bosom, 
hardly taking rank above some trout stream in Wiscon- 
sin, and the Lake of the Woods rivaling Lake Michigan. 
In answer to a request in a late teachers’ examination 
to give four or five of the more important commercial 
rivers of Europe, the Thames and the Seine had rare 
mention in comparison with some unpronounceable, un- 
heard-of streams in the frozen regions of Russia. 
Pupils should early in these studies be taught them- 
selves to distinguish the important features of the State, 
passing some with little more than a courteous nod of 
recognition, and dwelling upon others with careful and 
thoughtful investigation. In the early colonial settle- 
ment of this country hardly more than two or three have 
any special bearing upon our national development and 
character. 
Nor can there be a more fatal mistake, I think, than 
to feel that every subject must be exhausted before ad- 
vancing to the next. Few are the topics even in the 
lower grades that can be considered in all their details. 
There are in numbers from one to ten many points that 
demand a well-trained intellect, a nice discrimination, a 
familiarity with some of the higher mathematics to dis- 
cuss satisfactorily—points on which the keenest intellects 
may still whet their sharpest thought, points whose con- 
sideration is futile, if not confusing, to the children who 
can not give the sum of three and four without counting. 
To the child the half of four quarters is as simple as 
the half of four wholes, and it is as easy to count quar- 
ters as wholes, by twos and threes, without troubling 
them too long with the distinction of division and separa-  
-P-A-G-E-118
    102 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
tion, the question of dividing fractions by whole numbers, 
et id omne genus, which may be safely left to mathemati- 
cal experts and normal teachers for the diversion of their 
long winter evenings, over the fragrant coffee and tooth- 
some cake. 
Many are the topics of the early grades to which the 
advanced teacher should sometimes revert when the fit- 
ting time comes round, when the higher principles and 
broader generalizations will throw a flood of light into 
many an obscure corner. 
It is important, too, that the teacher even of the first 
grades should be familiar with subjects that are to come 
later, some in the grammar, some in the high school, 
that she may so shape her instruction that nothing be 
taught which the learned high-school teacher shall feel 
called upon to deny. Even in planting the seed it is 
well to know whether it be designed to produce a bean- 
stalk or an oak, and whether the sprouting germ will 
first push its blade or its root to the light. In this view, 
too, the value of reviews becomes more distinct and pro- 
nounced in bringing out the strong, the essential points 
of the subject, and fixing them in the memory, in seeing 
the several topics in their right relations as parts of one 
connected whole, unobscured by many a suggestion and 
explanation, which had been introduced simply as aids to 
the right understanding of the subject, or as stagings for 
the builders which must needs be removed before the 
temple can be seen in its symmetry and its beauty. A re- 
view is a far different thing from an ordinary daily reci- 
tation, calling into exercise different powers and fraught 
with higher results; and reviews themselves should be 
varied, now consisting of little more than a concise analy- 
sis, and again tracing more closely the true line of the 
argument or discussion. A review of the previous lesson
-P-A-G-E-119
  THE TEACHER IN THE SCHOOL-ROOM. 108 
should be considered as much a part of the daily recita- 
tion as the parts assigned in advance ; and the custom of 
some of employing the last few minutes of an exercise in 
gathering up the important thoughts of the lesson just 
recited is by no means an unfruitful one. 
After a careful, critical examination of a page in 
Latin, in which for purposes of construction or compar- 
ison of idioms the text has been followed too closely for 
elegance, how can the work be better completed than 
by calling upon some two or three to give a simple, unin- 
terrupted translation in genuine idiomatic English, with 
a due observance of the points so critically discussed at 
the first rendering ? 
How slight the task, too, in the higher grade, with its 
greater maturity and larger grasp, to comprehend some 
difficulties of a topic over which the most thoughtful and 
laborious effort of teacher and pupil would have been in 
vain two or three years earlier where the subject was out- 
lined in the graded course ! 
And if we would awaken or preserve the enthusiasm, 
quicken the interest, and secure the attention of our pu- 
pils, there must be progression in our work. Each new 
lesson must present something new and interesting, some- 
thing worth knowing. No mere humdrum of familiar 
facts, with endless and listless repetition, till the pupils, 
and sometimes the teachers, lose sight of the very mean- 
ing of the words and formulas repeated will suffice. Not 
a line should be gone over without something to stimu- 
late inquiry and call forth new and more strenuous effort, 
something whose successful accomplishment shall give a 
deeper joy, a fuller satisfaction. Each morning should 
the pupil feel that a discovery awaits him, drawing him 
resistlessly to school, wondering within himself that nine 
o’clock comes so late. I have known such schools and
-P-A-G-E-120

seen such pupils, the product of such teachers. It would 
seem that a little thought in this direction would clear 
up the foggy atmosphere hanging gloomily over the 
much-mooted subject of grammar and parsing. 
It is not the technical character of the subject that is 
objected to. All science to be of worth must be techni- 
cal, must be accurate, with well-defined terms, or all dis- 
cussion will be worthless and investigation vain. It is 
the dreary, fruitless routine that should be avoided, and 
the arbitrary, unmeaning terms. 
Where is the child of ten years who does not know 
that hat is singular if he knows the meaning of singular, 
a single thing ; that man is masculine; that book is of 
the third person, though just how and when it became a 
person at all might perplex him a little at first? The 
earlier lesson, why J should be of the first person, you of 
the second, and he of the third, might well employ a few 
minutes for clear apprehension. It may be necessary to 
call their attention to the fact that the thing hat is not a 
noun at all, though the want of that might not appreci- 
ably affect his success in life. 
But this parsing is what is incomprehensible. Why 
not adopt the same process in the other branches? Why 
not in geography, for example, require the form: Chica- 
goisacity. Rule: A city is a collective body of inhab- 
itants incorporated and governed by a mayor and alder- 
men. It has so many inhabitants. Rule: Inhabitants 
are the people who live in the city. Exception: Most 
people live in the country. It is situated on Lake Michi- 
gan. ule: A lake is a body of fresh water larger than 
a pond. uception: Some lakes are salt. Haception 
second: Some ponds are larger than some lakes. Shop- 
ping is mostly done by women. Rule: Woman is a 
complex, limiting modifier of the first class. Hacep-
-P-A-G-E-121
  THE TEACHER IN THE SCHOOL-ROOM. 105 
tion: Some women are school-teachers. Remark: Many 
persons have no limiting modifiers. Remark second: 
Such persons are sometimes called independent cases. 
And so on through the cities of the State and country. 
This may and probably does seem idle twaddle; but 
it is no exaggeration of what we are daily doing in our 
classes in grammar and parsing. 
And then, too, the rules which we force into the un- 
willing minds. ‘‘ An article modifies the noun which it 
limits.” For instance, ‘A boy plays.” In what way is 
boy modified ? What do we know of his age, size, or dis- 
position ? It is bad enough to say that an article limits, 
for in this case it removes all limits, making it the uni- 
versal boy. Again, “‘A verb agrees with its subject in 
number and person.” ‘‘I wrote, you wrote, he wrote; 
we wrote, you wrote, they wrote.” A most agreeable 
collection of verbal forms, surely. Can it greatly 
serve to cultivate an accurate, critical habit of thought ? 
And, as if this were not enough, the pupil must “by 
hook or crook” learn to diagram it upon the blackboard ; 
but such expressions as “‘I done it,” ‘‘ He has never went 
to any other school,” ‘<I hain’t got no pen,” will all 
yield sweet subservience to the demands of the links and 
kinks of diagramming. What endless, useless repetition, 
too, is required in going through a paragraph when per- 
haps but a single word or two merit any attention! 
Whatever thought there is must precede the analysis, 
while the diagram gives little evidence of a correct under- 
standing. 
Notice the familiar lines : 
The curfew tolls the knell of parting day. 
Plain and simple. As plain as can be; not an obscurity 
or an inversion ; nothing simpler. 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
    106 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
The lowing herd winds slowly o’er the lea. 
So: 
The plowman homeward plods his weary way. 
And so, too: 
And leaves the world to darkness and to me. 
There is nothing of grammar to warrant a moment’s 
attention of the pupil ready to appreciate the poem. Let 
him rather consider the origin of the curfew, and the 
conditions making such a precaution necessary ; the total 
Joss of the first meaning, since the cows are but just 
coming home; the nice use of “‘ parting,” not “ depart- 
ing,” in connection with the dying day ; the lowing herd ; 
wind, not winds, as some of the books have it, in long 
line to the milking ; the alliteration in plowman plods 
and weary way. 
What pretty subjects, too, for descriptive composition 
here! What a pleasing variety would be furnished by 
the pupils according to their mental pictures ! 
A due regard for the essentials of thought will do 
much to promote good reading, and without it there can 
be no good reading or speaking, whatever the elocution- 
ary powe1 or dramatic art exhibited. For example : 
Within this lowly grave a conqueror lies— 
—not a beggar— 
And yet the monument proclaims it not. 
—i.e., there is no monument, save a simple headstone— 
Nor round the sleeper’s name hath chisel wrought— 
—no sculpture there— 
A simple name alone. 
Nothing but the name; no title. Nor was it a simple 
name—the good, honored name of “ Sarah.”
-P-A-G-E-123

Again : 
With love she conquered hate— 
—not with hate, as is often done— 
i And overcame evil with good— 
—not evil— 
In her great Master’s name— 
—trusting not in her own strength, but his. 
There is no need here of inquiry as to the reader’s 
understanding of the thought. It has been already an- 
swered before the asking by the expression given in the 
reading, and whether just like your own does not matter 
so much. 
Correct expression must come, if at all, from intelli- 
gent, definite thought, producing a picture upon the 
mental or spiritual sensorium as distinct and as readily 
recognized as the features of a familiar friend. And if 
we would give to language its true value, and render it 
an efficient instrument of clear, discriminating study and 
thought, then must each new word, as it comes up, be 
clearly apprehended. From the first grade to the last 
must the subject under consideration be made visible, as 
it were, to the young mind, that when afterward he shall 
meet with it in study or familiar use, no dimness shall 
obscure the thought or present it to him in vague and 
shadowy outline. 
Whether it be strictly true or not, as Plato has it, that 
all vision is reminiscence, there can be little doubt that, 
if we would trace back to the origin of our ideas, the ele- 
ments of most of our mental resources, we should find 
they came to us through the agency of sense and sensible 
objects. Small use in speaking of ice to the untaught 
dweller of the tropics. 
From the object to the word, from the concrete to the
-P-A-G-E-124
  108 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
abstract, seems to be the true order; and as the young 
pupil takes the paper, the sticks, the clay, the cube, the 
sphere, the plant, the mineral, handles them, feels, sees, 
examines them, before he deals much in verbal definition 
or long description, so should it be, I think, with much 
of the illustrative apparatus, mechanical and physical, in 
the higher grades. 
Instead of bringing out the electrical machine, the 
model engine, the manikin, at the close of the week or 
month, as was the practice of our old professors after the 
study of the subject was completed, for the exhibition of 
the professor’s learning or his deftness in manipulation, 
they should be accessible to the student from the outset. 
The valve, the piston, the coil should be before him, be 
in his hands, with the book as an assistant, a reference. 
What profit in learning from the printed page the de- 
scription of the air-pump by the pupil who has never 
seen its structure and workings! Once and again have 
I seen a class sent with biting censure to their seats 
for not defining what had no shape or place in their 
minds, of which no reminiscence could assist the vision. 
And withal, as a delicate perfume, pervading the 
whole life of the school-room, should be the quiet but 
firm spirit of persuasive control ; first of all, control of 
self, which is of itself a power over others, giving that air 
of calm confidence which is of the very essence of per- 
suasion. Little persuasive power resides in the fretful, 
worrying soul. 
«‘ When will you take Vicksburg ?” was the taunting 
rebel inquiry of Grant, as he sat down, like a double-faced 
Janus, between those two opposing armies. 
“‘T shall take Vicksburg, if it takes me thirty years,” 
was his calm, persuasive answer. 
A recent novel-writer makes the waiting-maid say of
-P-A-G-E-125
  THE TEACHER IN THE SCHOOL-ROOM. 109 
her mistress, ‘‘She has an unfair advantage of me, for 
she never scolds.” The scolding teacher is often the bad 
boy’s sweetest opportunity, for he can always contrive to 
answer back, a chance he dearly loves and persistently 
labors for. 
There is, indeed, a worthy indignation at wrong and 
injustice ; but even to this the controlled expression, soft- 
ened by sorrow for the untoward offender, often gives a 
twofold force and leaves no cause, in ill-advised words, 
for long regret. The harsh and rasping tone has no more 
place in the schoolroom than in the angelic choir. 
And not below the teacher’s regard, but cementing the 
very foundations of her influence, is the cheery ‘‘ Good 
morning” ; the quiet, grateful ‘‘Thank, you” for the 
little favor or polite attention ; the thoughtful “‘ Excuse 
me” for the slight accident or some inadvertency ; the 
glad recognition of well-earned success and sincere regret 
for failure ; and the kindly ‘‘ Good-night ” at the school- 
day’s close. 
Far more potent than the formal lecture or the solemn 
homily are these little graceful recognitions of the pupils’ 
rights to respect and gentle courtesy, and go far toward 
inducing in them those habits of considerate conduct 
whose fuller development into active principles savors at 
least of morality. 
This cheerful, loving life that is breathing through 
our lower schools the cold critic and learned professor 
may scoff at or deny. Safely ensconced on their stern 
heights, this spring-tide of warmth and sunshine has not 
reached them. They look out upon the firm rock, hard 
and forbidding as of old ; the dwarf pine and scrub hem- 
lock wear their last winter’s greenness; adown the mount- 
ain sides the giant old trees, with their withering foliage 
at half-mast over the sad approach of civilization, shut

from them the beauty of the wakened fields below, and 
their sighing branches drown the music of bursting buds 
and the unfolding of tender leaves which shall ere long 
fill our land with health and happiness. 
In the character and conduct of the teacher is the 
strength and hope of the school; and then will our cali- 
ing become a profession when we do professional work, 
and our profession be a noble one when we do its duties 
nobly. 
VII. 
HOW THE SCHOOL DEVELOPS CHARACTER. 
DIFFER as we may in many matters, we are all agreed 
in effect that the one chief aim of school-life is character, 
and fortunately, or unfortunately, to this end, whether 
we will or not, we are all and always contributing. 
It is only when we come to the ways and means for 
the informing and proper unfolding of a true character 
that our differences and discussions begin, sometimes 
these differences going down to the very foundations, the 
first principles of real education, and again resolving 
themselves into mere variances in the meaning and use of 
words. 
We need not look long in Webster for the meaning of 
character, one of those terms understood by all, but so 
hard to define. The word, which we have from the 
Greeks, whose ideal was the perfect individual, meant 
first the point, the graver’s tool; then the line, the dis- 
tinguishing trait, the inner life of the man. The Roman, 
on the other hand, who, with his genius for organiza- 
tion, cared for the individual only in his relations to the
-P-A-G-E-127
  HOW THE SCHOOL DEVELOPS CHARACTER. 111 
state, had only the superficial term mores, habits, cus- 
toms, those practices alone which come within the cog- 
nizance of the community, the state. 
We, who unite in our thought the individual with the 
citizen, enlarge our idea of character to include them 
both, believing that the worthy citizen can not be an un- 
worthy man. 
It is, perhaps, enough for us to consider that, from 
the very nature of the case, all character is mental, and 
that all development of character comes from mental 
training, from the informing of the mind, and giving it 
those surroundings that favor its unfolding. The dog, 
indeed, in a restricted sense may be credited with a char- 
acter, may be ugly or kind, and the horse gentle or vi- 
cious, but it is only as intellectual beings, capable of 
growth and progress, that we speak of the influence of 
our schools upon the formation of character. 
From the defects of language we are often uncon- 
sciously led into the error of separating in our thought 
those things that are indissolubly connected, and to talk 
of character building as something different from the 
training, the disciplining of the mind, and to suppose 
that we can labor worthily for the unfolding and uplift- 
ing of the personal character and life, without that 
knowledge, that in-formation of the intellectual nature 
which alone places us above the brute, and makes us 
worthy of a place in the school-room in the capacity 
either of teacher or pupil. 
The intellectual, industrial, social, and moral charac- 
ter of an individual, as we use the terms in our daily 
speech, are but different phases of the one and same mind 
in its workings and manifestations, as we speak of the 
form, the combination, the coloring, and the worth of a 
painting. 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
  412 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
We are considering merely his knowledge and judg- 
ment, his likes and dislikes, his sense of obligation, or 
his power over his material belongings. 
The simple elements of character are, it would seem, 
few in number but manifold in their combinations and 
applications, and in some measure are all early employed, 
though the period for the special cultivation and develop- 
ment of the different powers is a matter of the first im- 
portance. 
Let us consider for a moment the early mental pro- 
cesses of the child. A word is uttered, he places his hand 
upon his mother’s face. Simple sensations both, but 
giving no information, no knowledge. Again and again 
the tone, the touch. Memory now recalls the first sensa- 
tion, notes the resemblances, and there follows the con- 
scious perception. He hears, perceives other sounds un- 
like the first, and by imagination choosing the essentials 
of each, he has now a conception of sound, as we select 
the essentials of a leaf, yet thinking of no individual leaf, 
and we draw what we call a conventional leaf. With 
the conceptions multiplied, now can he begin to exercise 
his reason and judgment, begin to think clearly and con- 
secutively. 
With these powers in exercise, with their bright or 
dark blossoming, under the influence of a warm imagina- 
tion, of likes and dislikes, hopes and fears, and the whole 
crowd of passions and desires, there is little more required 
to make up the life and character of most of us; and, 
according as they are directed or controlled for wise or 
unwise purposes, is the worth of our characters. 
Little more is required, I said, and yet there remains 
the one faculty without which, with all our knowledge, 
we were little more, as regards power and influence, than 
the veriest puppets with which the skillful mechanic fills
-P-A-G-E-129
HOW THE SCHOOL DEVELOPS CHARACTER. 113 
the toy-stores—that one almost divine element of personal 
will to grasp or gather up any one or all of these, and 
wield them for the accomplishment of its chosen purpose. 
Nor is it from text-book or rare and costly volume 
that the only or, it may be, the richest lessons are to be 
learned or the mental powers trained to their best or 
highest efficiency. Books are valued only as they contain 
the records and examples of the years that are gone, of 
the trials and successes, the efforts and the failures of men 
and women like ourselves, the legacy of their lives and 
their achievements, their thoughts and their imaginings. 
From the printed page alone are we the heirs of the ages, 
surrounded by the comforts and elegances, and possessed 
of the wisdom and the virtues of this latest and greatest 
of the centuries. 
How to avail themselves of this rightful heritage, and 
take their true places in the forefront of the advancing 
column of enlightenment and noble purpose, is the first 
and still the last of the lessons due our pupils, to lead 
them at first by easy yet ever surer and more rapid steps, 
with keener desire and more elastic tread, with nicer dis- 
cernment and wider vision toward those heights of trans- 
figuration where they may commune face to face with 
the highest and the best. 
Words should become to them in the well-wrought 
sentence as living things, each instinct with the life of 
the embodied thought, which should come to them clear 
and distinct in its wealth of wisdom or its beauty. Into 
fitly chosen and connected words, too, should they learn 
to breathe their own best and worthiest thought, making 
their sentences the living messengers of truth and min- 
isters to the weary and needy heart of health and happi- 
ness. 
Not without its influence upon integrity of character 
9 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
  114 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
and personal worthiness is this accuracy in the expression 
of thought in its delicate shadings and nicer meanings, 
for its utterance demanding the clearness of conception 
which springs from the accurate perception of the real 
and the true in nature and in life, at which much of the 
teaching of the school should aim. Things as they are, 
in their qualities and uses, to be found out but by the 
seeing and the handling, in the doing and the making, 
are the alphabet from which the thought and the feeling 
of a Longfellow or a Gladstone or even a Hegel are to 
be read. The pupil must know what is true and beauti- 
ful ere the conception of truth and beauty can dawn upon 
his mental vision, must learn of the good and the right 
if ever goodness and righteousness shall be to him more 
than empty words. 
The teachings of history, the story of nations and in- 
dividuals, the lessons of causes and results, the revela- 
tions of the material, the mental, and the spiritual world, 
if rightly read, are as true as—are, indeed, words of sacred 
writ, and can be studied with as reverent a spirit and 
with the probability of as little error in the translation. 
The writings upon the rocks and the hieroglyphics of 
the heavens are as decipherable and as worthy of regard 
as those in the temples of Egypt or the palaces of Nine- 
veh. 
He who discovers a new truth or makes a new applica- 
tion of Nature’s forces for the welfare of man has opened 
a sacred volume and found a new interpretation of a 
hitherto dark and hidden passage. 
Truths and facts are not, of course, of equal worth, 
and a wise discernment is needful in separating the metal 
from the dross, the kernel from the chaff, or rather should 
we learn to choose now this, now that, as suited to our 
special purpose. Without the chaff there could be no
-P-A-G-E-131
HOW THE SCHOOL DEVELOPS CHARACTER. 115 
berry, without the dross no metal. But before us should 
be held, as a prime purpose, the cultivation of an intel- 
lectual integrity as the basis and condition of all moral 
and spiritual worth, 
Without the early perception of material things there 
can be no worthy imaginings, no sound reasonings. The 
mother, watching the smile of the infant in the cradle, 
fondly deems that it is dreaming of the angels ; but the 
angel is in the mother’s heart alone. The child has had 
no perceptions, no imaginings, none of ‘‘the stuff that 
dreams are made of,” and an angel is as far from his pos- 
sibilities as a dream of Italy from the untaught Eskimos. 
There can be no development or growth in the mem- 
orized repetition of another’s words ; no powers are called 
into action that constitute the elements of character. 
The phonograph can do as much with the addition of 
emphasis and intonation. 
Nor is it in the desultory, haphazard learning of un- 
connected facts that we look for aught of value in train- 
ing the pupil for a life of usefulness. Thought must be 
consecutive to be educative, if I may be allowed to coin 
a needed word, must be systematic, logical, or the knowl- 
edge gained has no informing power. The knowledge 
that is worthy the name of imformation must give the 
learner the power and the principles that shall enable 
him to advance step by step from fixed facts to definite 
conclusions, to see things in a clearer, broader light, or 
the mind is not informed or enlightened. 
We need, too, to place the pupils, as far as possible, 
upon their own responsibility. The school trains them 
to punctuality, order, system, and subordination, but too 
often affords them little opportunity for self-control, self- 
guidance, and self-help, more important to their well- 
being than most of the subjects taught from the books. 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
116 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
Their hours are arranged, their tasks assigned, the ex~ 
tent of their study and reading marked out, with little 
room for any plan, any design, any decision of their own 
—any effort in any self-chosen work. 
And when the pupil steps from the graduation stage, 
in what direction is he to move? To whom is he to 
look ? His tasks must now be assigned by himself; the 
extent of his efforts and the limits of his labors deter- 
mined by his own judgment, with success or defeat de- 
pendent upon his ability to discern and meet the demand 
of the hour. 
Hardly can we too strongly urge the need of cultivat- 
ing more thoroughly that self-determining, self-directing 
power of a free, firm will—not that form of will, or rather 
dead stubbornness, which yields neither to persuasion nor 
argument, whose only power is found in resistance, but 
that faculty which can concentrate all needful energies 
to the performance of its chosen work. 
I have no faith in the thought so often expressed, 
supported though it be by great names, that application 
is genius; but it is a grand element of success and, with 
a worthy aim, of usefulness, in both of which genius is 
often sadly lacking. With all our culture we do not 
gather grapes of thorns, nor figs of thistles, nor will the 
most plodding dullard ever exhibit a spark of what we 
call genius. He breathes another atmosphere, and leads 
another life. His pathway may be bordered by the daisy 
and the dandelion, and his days be peace. Genius takes 
a loftier flight. 
We should see to it that no narrowing, belittling 
niotive be allowed to sway the minds and guide the efforts 
of the aspiring, earnest pupils, filling their young hearts 
with a restless, feverish desire for some paltry, worthless 
bauble of relative rank or position, withering the soul,
-P-A-G-E-133
  HOW THE SCHOOL DEVELOPS CHARACTER. 117 
and ruinous alike to true scholarship and worthy char- 
acter. 
It is the love of good learning and the best modes of 
attaining it—the purposes of education—that are of more 
worth than any acquirements of the school-room, besides 
which the mere unintelligent knowledge there gained 
sinks into insignificance. 
The school at best can give but the beginnings of a 
useful scholarship. Many of the best books are beyond 
the appreciation or enjoyment of school age, even if there 
were time for more than a sip at the perennial fountain. 
But a direction toward the sources of a true intellectual 
life can be given, a desire awakened for deeper and richer 
thoughts, and the spirit quickened, which shall not fail 
to impart guidance and strength for the realization of 
higher hopes and nobler characters. 
Nor should we forget the physical part of our natures, 
especially in these later years, with the strong tendency 
of the richest life and keenest activities to the cities, filled 
as they are with their offices and palace stores. 
It has long seemed to me a misfortune that during 
all the years of school-life our pupils could have nothing 
of the old farm and shop education of our early days, 
with the variety of employment which they gave—could 
have no productive industry. 
Mere physical labor, the work of the brute, may be 
degrading, but the training of the mind to a better con- 
trol of the hand, the ennobling of labor, of the rule of 
man over material things, from which spring so many of 
the blessings of our civilization—that ballasting of our 
thoughts and our otherwise unstable imagination by the 
substance and reality of fact—can not be passed by with 
a sneer and scornful smile. 
Hand in hand with this intellectual life, and guided
-P-A-G-E-134
  118 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
by it, should proceed that moral life and development 
for which from my heart I believe that our public schools, 
with all their faults, are among the most efficient agen- 
cies, as they afford to the capable teacher the most favor- 
able opportunities. 
Though but a fraction of the pupil’s time is passed 
beneath the teacher’s care, yet the influence of him who 
is called to the care, the cure of minds and hearts, does 
not begin or end at the tinkling of the bell, but reaches 
out to the play-ground, the street, and into the very 
privacy of the home. The original fiber of the mental 
structure may not be changed nor the prime elements of 
character supplanted. 
It is not character building with which the teacher 
has to do, but rather character development and training. 
We are not laying in this or that brick or block of marble, 
putting in this or that kind or quality of wood, but guid- 
ing and directing its growth, checking here a vicious 
tendency, and here encouraging a striving for the good, 
giving the active, aggressive powers a proper aim, and 
gradually inducing those habits of thought and action, 
that power of self-government that shall make him in 
school and out of school, and when school-days are over, 
a willing worker for good, trustworthy in social and busi- 
ness relations, submissive to rightful authority, true to 
his better self and to his neighbor, and reverencing truth, 
wherever found, as the writing of God’s own finger, loyal 
ever and always to the right. 
Not by the hand of stern repression, nor at the arbi- 
trary will and power of superior force, is this task to be 
accomplished, but by the delicate, tender touch of a lov- 
ing, sympathetic nature, by kindly, thoughtful control, 
kindness begetting trust, confidence inducing truthful- 
ness, patience, self-control; the graceful recognition of
-P-A-G-E-135
  HOW THE SCHOOL DEVELOPS CHARACTER. 119 
worthy effort imparting new strength to right impulse, 
and the living example of uprightness and honorable, 
generous feeling and dealing awakening the slumbering 
nature to the realization of a better, a worthier, a higher 
life. 
With all our talking and teaching we do not yet rise, 
I believe, to the appreciation of the power for good of a 
kind, sympathetic, manly, womanly, personal influence 
—an understanding of what we might be and do. 
The ordinary child upon entering school is apt to look 
upon his teacher as a superior being who knows all 
things, sees all things, and who can direct her pupils to 
all that is desirable ; as one who abhors evil and loves 
the good; an embodiment of wisdom, excellence, and 
strength. 
Happy, and thrice happy, is she who can change these 
fond illusions into a sincere love, a generous respect, and 
a confiding trust. From his first wakening intelligence 
the pupil has been seeing, hearing, and handling some- 
thing new and interesting, has been learning of his sur- 
roundings, gaining the power to perceive, to imagine, to 
think, and to reason ; and now in the school is he to re- 
ceive a new impulse, to find his mental powers re-enforced 
by the inspiration of the wise teacher. 
Not till he has found his hopes defeated, his confi- 
dence betrayed, and his idol broken, does he relapse into 
the listless, sullen creature who makes teaching a trial 
and life a burden. 
We need. better to understand the child, to put our- 
selves in his place. He is untruthful, but is he hence- 
forth to be distrusted ? To the young mind, I think, 
untruthfulness is not of necessity immoral. He, it may 
be, has heard of Jack the Giant-Killer and the cow that 
jumped over the moon, and listened to the tales of Hen

Pen, till his whole nature is aroused to the love of the 
marvelous and the false. 
What wonderful stories has he heard and tried to 
rival! To what untruths has he listened and endeavored 
to surpass them! He has yet to learn, and nowhere 
better than in the school, the difference between pleasing, 
instructive fable and deceptive, disreputable falsehood, 
between poetic creation and stupid lying ; to discover the 
sanctity of truth and the virtue of generous integrity of 
thought and action, to be honest, upright, wholly and 
always reliable. 
He perhaps takes what is not his own, sees what will 
gratify his natural desires, and why should he withhold 
his hand? How is he to understand the sacredness of 
property, that what one has earned is his to the exclusion 
of all others, what many who would be regarded as phi- 
losophers do not admit. Should he be at once branded 
as a thief ? 
He is insulted by a companion, and raises his hand 
for a blow. Why not, when the grandest nations, under 
the lead of the most enlightened statesmen of the age, do 
the same, and when he finds his own teacher following 
his wrong-doings with sarcasm or suspension? Would 
you send him to the street to associate with swearers, 
plunderers, and blackguards, or try to lift him to a 
knowledge of honesty and a wise forbearance ? 
It is worthy of a serious thought, fellow-teachers—of 
_ serious thought and calm consideration—whether we shall 
sink or save him. That our pupils should be orderly and 
subordinate is essential to the well-being of the school , 
but that is not its highest purpose. The school is not 
itself an end, but the means, and the pleasing decorum 
of the school-room, if that be all, is hardly worth the 
pains. We wish the pupil himself to perceive the need

  HOW THE SCHOOL DEVELOPS CHARACTER. Tor 
and nature of system, to acquire that power of self-con- 
trol and regard for righteous law that shall become a part 
of his very self, a prime element of his character, to go 
with him from school and enter into all his life and his 
life’s duties as a citizen. 
And for some temporary inattention or slight neglect, 
which out of the school would hardly be a fault at all, 
shall he be severely censured, placed in disgrace with his 
mates, whose esteem he prizes, robbed of his self-respect ? 
Shall he be turned with his face to the wall, or, perchance, 
thrown upon the street, still further to follow the sight 
of his eyes and the devices of his own untrained mind ? 
There is at least a suggestion in the old word 
“mind.” ‘That boy must be made to mind ”—not 
merely to obey, to submit, like the horse or the ox, but 
to mind, to bring his perception, his reason, his judg- 
ment into play, and thoughtfully, cheerfully bring him- 
self into harmony with his position and surroundings. 
Perhaps, too, in the quiet bearing of the teacher, in her 
kind and firm sway, and sometimes charitable forbear- 
ance, he has read his first lesson, and seen the first ex- 
ample of that wise and impartial rule that should be the 
fashion in the home, the school, and the state. 
How I have sometimes seen a troublesome pupil 
startled out of his waywardness into a gentler mood be- 
cause the expected rebuke did not come nor the imagined 
blow fall! Confidence, too, begets confidence, and an 
apparent belief in his more wholesome desires is the best 
promoter of their development. 
Few are the pupils who will willingly offend one for 
whom they are accustomed to do the little favors and 
acts of kindness whose thankful reception implies a con- 
scious trust in their generous intent. Compelled obedi- 
ence may do for the ox, but for the conduct of life must

be laid the deeper foundations of a thoughtful regard for 
the right, cemented by the habit of a calm, conscious 
self-control. 
To the well-established, experienced incumbent of a 
position this order and, systematic action in the school 
should be one of the least of the difficulties of the day. 
It is the temporary teacher, the substitute, who deserves 
our sympathy and kindly estimate of her efforts. But 
the regular teacher, who after months or years still finds 
her pupils disorderly, restless, and idle, and is compelled 
often to resort to the principal for aid, may well ask her- 
self whether her powers might not better be employed in 
some other pursuit. She should have secured, on the 
part of her pupils, such a habit of orderly industry, such 
an appreciation of its benefits, such loyalty to herself, 
and such love of the right, that they would themselves 
frown down the lawless attempts of any new-comer. The 
government, the discipline of the room should have ceased 
to be the subject of anxious thought, and her undivided 
attention be given to the real work of the school, to en- 
livening their tasks, encouraging despondency, guiding 
their earnest efforts, and perhaps restraining any undue 
ambition. For checking any thoughtless act, a word, or 
even a look of surprise, should be all sufficient. 
Nothing worthy the name of character, I think, has 
been induced till, in the chance absence of the teacher, 
the pupils of their own accord shall fall to their places 
and their allotted work at the appointed time. 
The old-time topics of whispering and tardiness should 
give place with the experienced teacher to questions bear- 
ing more directly upon their mental growth; how to 
present the subjects more clearly, how to direct them to 
better sources of information, and how wisely sometimes 
to impart the needed knowledge with the best results ;
-P-A-G-E-139
  HOW THE SCHOOL DEVELOPS CHARACTER. 123 
to showing the bearing of their present studies upon their 
future well-being, and how to place herself in such rela- 
tions with them that even her unconscious bearing shall 
be to them lessons and illustrations of uprightness ever 
more effective than the stated lecture or formal lesson, 
and without which the best of these are worse than worth- 
less. 
Closely allied with order and system, and perhaps 
their surest basis, is the habit of quiet, earnest industry. 
The American boy—or girl, for that—who is worth 
the care of looking after, is active, alert, curious, and 
inventive, with a desire to see and do. He is eager to 
know somewhat of his surroundings, quick to perceive 
what is of interest, ever inquiring into the reasons, the 
causes of things and customs; and it is for the teacher 
to avail herself of these currents of life, and turn them 
into useful channels, to give these young minds problems 
of true interest to solve, and to put them upon the path 
of progress. Their energies can not and should not be 
repressed, but the teacher in full sympathy with their 
wants and needs should be able and willing so to guide 
their outreaching thought as to convert their active 
powers into abiding motives to successful work. 
The activity that is not thus guided must ever prove 
a disturbing element, and the best and most promising 
pupils become the source of confusion and discourage- 
ment. They should learn that success is not of chance, 
that all true excellence is the result of right effort, that 
work well directed wins, and that industry is the only 
sesame to material or spiritual wealth. 
No one without a purpose in life can be happy, no 
one without effort a success, and in the thoughtful, well- 
directed effort of the pupil to the attainment of some 
desirable result is found the truest promise of a worthy
-P-A-G-E-140
124 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
character—a character guarded against outward assault, 
and strong in a well-defined purpose of future good. 
Especially in its social relations does the school offer 
a fruitful field for the development of much that is best 
in character, which the wise teacher can ill afford to 
ignore. Indeed, only in its social relations do many of 
the most important questions present themselves to the 
teacher’s attention. It is only from the associated num- 
bers in the school-room that the subject of truth and 
honor comes under the teacher’s notice, that integrity 
and uprightness can be cultivated and deeply rooted in 
the very nature of the pupil, that a right impulse can be 
given to manly courtesy, to womanly grace, and to mu- 
tual consideration and respect, the sturdier strength of 
the boy more truly attempered with kindness and justice, 
and the finer fiber of the girl unconsciously annealed to 
a more ductile grace and more healthful sympathies. 
We often complain, and justly, of the number of 
pupils to a teacher, and probably with eight or ten pupils 
in a class a more rapid progress might be secured in the 
studies of the school-room ; but for the growth and de- 
velopment of all that is valuable in character, better sixty 
pupils under the sympathetic sway of the capable teacher 
than the paltry dozen of pampered pets and petted pup- 
pets of the exclusive and high-priced private school. 
Here in the full room do we find a reason for the sub- 
dued quiet and order, without which close study is im- 
possible and hope of progress vain. Here, too, the neces- 
sity for a controlling power, a single head, some sufficient 
authority, not merely to restrain and quell the restless 
and the wayward, but to secure the earnest and studious 
from unintentional interruption or interference; and 
here, too, we learn that mutual and willing concession is 
the only security for the most valued rights of all. And
-P-A-G-E-141
HOW THE SCHOOL DEVELOPS CHARACTER. 125 
here the children of the rich and the poor, the foreign 
born and the descendants of colonial Puritan or Cavalier, 
meet upon a common ground, the heir to lordly wealth 
often surpassed in strength and keenness of intellect by 
the child of poverty and toil. 
What basis is here found upon which to build the 
barriers of caste and class? What. better school for the 
practical study of civics, for shaping the character of the 
child for all the duties of a worthy, intelligent citizen- 
ship, knowing his own rights and regardful of the rights 
of others, and wisely mindful of both ? 
With a due recognition of the rights of his fellows, 
loyal ever to well-regulated authority, with his powers 
developed and trained, may we not hope for our pupils a 
citizenship more useful to the state than was found 
among the stern Romans, and a better development of 
individual worth than Grecian philosophy ever sought or 
found? Have we not the elements of a public and pri- 
vate morality worthy of the respect and support of every 
lover of his kind ? The formal, unmeaning, unexplained 
reading of a few disconnected verses of the Bible may be 
omitted. But. are there not still the home, the church, 
the parent, the pastor, the Sunday-school ? ‘‘ Without 
note or comment” itself suggests to the thoughtful pupil 
some hidden danger, against which the teacher is an 
unsafe guide. 
The religious household still has its morning devotions, 
after which one child goes to the store or the office, and 
another to the quiet, orderly school-room, strengthened 
in the one case as the other, we trust, by the morning 
consecration. 
If we read the names of those who have gone out from 
our schools, we do not find them duplicated upon the 
registers of houses of correction and of prisons.

The Canadian shore may be fringed with those who, 
in their haste to be rich, have been faithless to their 
trusts ; but these were educated in Christian, in sectarian 
colleges or schools where the Scriptures were read and 
prayers repeated. 
Not yet in the busy ranks of life are there many to 
whom the Bible was an unread book in school. __ 
The Bible to be useful must be read more thought- 
fully, more intelligently, and not tossed aside without a 
word or look of gratitude. As an influence upon the 
school, if experience does not belie the fact, the morning 
song or hymn, with its sweet and tender sentiment up- 
borne by the glad concord of happy voices, is far more 
effective in attuning the heart and preparing the thought 
for the cheerful and successful performance of daily duty 
than the bare and barren reading of a few detached, dis- 
connected verses of even Holy Writ, and, I believe, lifts 
the soul nearer heaven. 
As all roads lead to Rome, so from whatever point or 
on what line soever I proceed my thought always brings 
me at last to the teacher, on whose fitness and fidelity 
the efficiency of all these forces depends. 
First of her qualifications is that wholesome personal 
influence, still unexplained by the philosopher, but read 
by the veriest child—that something which embraces the 
will of the new-comer, makes it subservient to her desire, 
and leads him unconsciously along the path of duty, and 
brings him into harmomy with the conditions of the 
school-room. It inspires him with a self-respect and 
pride in his school, and encourages him to the perform- 
ance of otherwise irksome tasks, instead of turning him 
back by a cold and formal dignity to the street or the 
saloon. 
His passions and desires, which form, as it were, the

skirmish line to the advancing column of learning and 
enlightenment, instead of leading him into the swamps 
of depression and sloughs of vice and despondency, under 
her wise and firm control are to lead the way over all the 
dangers and difficulties of life’s march to assured and 
well-earned victory, when the better emotions and truer 
sentiments may partake with real pleasure of the fruits 
of deserved success. 
Under her guidance labor becomes a pleasure, and the 
irksomeness of restraint takes on the garb of joyous com- 
pliance with the wishes of a trusted guide. Harshness 
and severity are unknown, because unneeded ; censure 
has changed to loved counsel ;:and willing, earnest effort, 
little by little, takes the place of forced and unfruitful 
toil. 
The teacher alone can breathe life into the exercises 
of the school and make effective all these means of cult- 
ure and growth. Nor can she lay off the load of responsi- 
bility. From the moment she enters the school-room— 
even before she enters—her influence is a power for good 
or evil to each and every one of the boys and girls in- 
trusted to her care, and no moral precepts can be so 
efficient as her own conduct and bearing. Whether list- 
less or alert, faithful or careless, truthful or forgetful of 
the right, she is still making or marring the life of 
them all. 
The influence of a promise unperformed or an unexe- 
cuted threat no teaching can undo. A calm confidence 
under seeming defeat, a living hope amid all discourage- 
ments, and an unfailing charity in the face of apparent, 
of real guilt, should be in large store in her outfit. 
Fellow-teachers, if these words of mine are of any 
worth, it is because they are not the product of vain 
imaginings, but have come from long observation and

be great, but the ideals upon which they are based are 
within easy reach. Any day of the school year a half- 
hour’s or an hour’s ride will take me into the presence 
of those from whom my pictures have been drawn. My 
ideal is a present reality, and the realization of this ideal 
in our own schools has but strengthened and confirmed 
my belief in the ever-increasing efficiency of the public 
school as one of the means for the training of our boys 
and girls in the — of worthy characters.

THE CLASS RECITATION. 
| 
WubTHER we regard the prime purpose of the school 
as mental or moral instruction and discipline, the forma- 
tion of character, or the manual skill that shall aid in 
securing a comfortable livelihood, the recitation is that 
about which center all the activities of school-life, giving 
it success or stamping it with failure. 
The personal influence of the teacher is of the first 
importance ; the power to control and direct, invaluable; 
the magnetism which shall inspire and incite to earnest, 
loving effort, a necessity to the accomplished, successful 
teacher ; but all of these qualifications find full scope in 
the recitation, and, without this end, they have little 
cause or reason to be. 
The recitation is the controlling influence, determin- 
ing the length and character of the lessons, the manner 
of their preparation, the conduct of the pupil, his hours 
of study, his interest in school, and his regard for his

teacher, and gives the color, the value, to all his school- 
days, his waking and his sleeping hours. 
It is the recitation, with its direct or indirect in- 
fluences, which makes him a trusty friend or a hopeless 
truant, a student or a scamp, and which will guide him 
along the paths of honest and successful industry, or into 
the by-ways of indolence and worthlessness, 
Here he finds the rewards of well-doing or the con- 
demnation of his negligence ; an incitement to renewed 
effort or an excuse for feeble exertion and lax endeavor. 
In the recitation, too, the teacher gives proof of her call- 
ing or shows her unfitness for her position. In the reci- 
tation is concentrated the devotion, the thought, the life 
of the teacher, and the work, the purpose, the zeal, and 
the performance of the pupil. Here is displayed the life 
of the school, and here is decided whether the school 
shall be a means of growth and development or a source 
of unworthy motive, of false aims and ignoble character. 
There is a common and flippant charge made against 
the public graded school, that the individual is neglected, 
that all are recklessly run through the same mill, with- 
out regard to the personal peculiarities of the pupil or to 
the purpose of his life; that the alert and the sluggish 
mind receive the same stupefying potions—that to the 
future senator and the incipient slugger are administered 
the same dull and dismal doses of dreary didactics and 
deadening discourses. 
But the intelligent teacher soon discerns the differ- 
ences of character and disposition, and distinguishes the 
slow and logical thinker from the ready, but unreasoning 
reciter; the cultured heir to wealth and winning ways 
from the child of sturdy toil and untrained manners ; 
and adjusts herself and her instructions to the equally 
imperative, but differing needs of each,

And in the varying characters and contrasted thought 
of each may the other derive a knowledge of society and 
real life which shall fit him for the duties and responsi- 
bilities of his after-calling that no exclusive training 
could impart. Not because they are in the same class or 
grade do they receive the same impressions or benefits, or 
learn the same lessons of science, of truthfulness, of right. 
One acquires the love of learning and the principles 
which shall urge him onward to assured success, while 
the other simply tastes of the cup that shall cheer his 
idle hours and give him higher thoughts of humanity 
and life. One is awakened to the full use of his powers 
in the grand struggle of existence, which shall bring him 
a glad fruition ; the other merely finds an adornment of 
his leisure hours, a pleasing resource from the weary 
demands upon his time and attention. 
To the one, his study becomes an important part of 
his life work, while to the other, his acquisitions are but 
a grateful relief from perplexing and troublous cares. 
To one the recitation is an inspiring duty ; to another, 
a wearisome task, or perchance, a diversion. 
Notwithstanding the pleasing picture, so often drawn, 
of Garfield and Dr. Hopkins upon their log, it somehow 
happens that our pupils are not all Garfields, and it may 
perhaps with equal safety be admitted that we are not all 
Hopkinses. And, however useful a proper amount of 
such familiar intercourse might prove—and the rela- 
tion of teacher and pupil should, I. think, contain the 
possibility of this intimate converse—yet for the common 
instruction of the school, I confess, for myself, a firm 
and abiding faith in the power of class-teaching. 
We do not all grow into the same likeness of form or 
feature by sitting at the same table and supplying our 
daily wants from the same bill of fare.

In the college and university, with more mature 
minds and more definite purposes of life, with habits of 
thought and investigation already formed, the literary 
or philosophic lecture or the scientific dissertation 
‘may fulfill their purpose, but in the public school, 
including the high-school, the skill and power of the 
teacher find their best expression in the well-conducted 
recitation. 
In the. right recitation should be sought, and by 
some means secured, the close and fixed attention of 
each and every pupil. To it he should come as a seeker, 
a discoverer of hidden treasure. Every power should be 
awake, the interest aroused, to get some clew to assist 
him in his future search, some data to verify the conclu- 
sions of his own efforts. He should be on the alert to 
perceive any wrong statement, to note any undue color- 
ing, and be ready to correct the false deduction and 
refute the empty argument by a clear presentation of 
real or supposed truth. The recitation of one should be 
the recitation of all, and thus class instruction become 
truly individual instruction, with the added interest and 
power that can come only from contact of mind with 
mind. A 
The pupil who merely rises and repeats with close 
fidelity the words of the book has done nothing but 
exhibit an exercise of the memory, a power not to be 
despised, but lamented here, as so far short of the aim of 
the recitation. This power of memory is one of inesti- 
mable value, this power to repeat with strict accuracy 
the words of an author; a power fitted to hold in its 
fast and fond embrace the immortal words and sentences 
which spring only from inspired hearts and minds, and 
should not be wasted upon the frivolous and belittling 
lines so often found upon the pages of our educational 
 
-P-A-G-E-148

papers ; too grand a power for a trifling triplet of words, 
or for the paltry passages of unimportant history. 
The teacher greatly underrates his opportunities and 
mistakes his calling who simply puts forth his questions 
and signifies his assent or dissent to the correctness of 
the recital with an accompanying mark of merit or 
demerit. 
A very-ordinary text-book can do all that for the 
boys and girls, and much more. They are there to be 
taught, to be directed, to be encouraged, inspired to the 
prosecution of their purpose, and the dull, dead “not 
correct,” with no indication of the nature of the error, 
no suggestion, falls like a blow upon the defenseless head 
of a young ambition that might have been guided to a 
worthy, useful life. 
This recitation is much more than a test of the pupil’s 
memory ; he is to be taught to think, to consider the 
reasons for or against the statements of the book or the 
teacher, and clearly and thoughtfully express his views, 
He may be all wrong in his conclusions, and yet show a 
strength, a power of reasoning and statement fairly en- 
titling him to a high rank as a student. His knowledge 
may be insufficient, his data incorrect, but his deductions 
from his premises conclusive. 
The clear and correct expression of his opinions and 
judgments is to be encouraged as an important part of 
the recitation. I recollect how, in the old days—and 
some of the old fellows, I fear, still live—when we vent- 
ured to essay our unfledged wings in feeble flight, we 
were brought up standing with the supposed unanswer- 
able remark, that ‘‘It was written by Dr. So and So, and 
it was hardly worth while to try to improve upon his lan- 
guage.” And, perhaps, the eminent doctor, too, was but 
repeating the words of some preceding eminent dullard.    
-P-A-G-E-149
  THE CLASS RECITATION. 133 
True thought is more than compiling facts, and the 
correct expression of that thought in well chosen words 
and molded phrase and sentence better than glib re- 
cital; and whether the pupil agrees with the author 
should cut a small figure in determining the worth of 
his recitation. 
The worth of the recitation who shall tell? What 
does it show of the power of application acquired ; of the 
careful analysis, the thoughtful investigation ? Has he 
a firm grasp of the subject, any correct principles to aid 
him hereafter, any living idea that is to germinate and 
develop into anything of worth in forming his mind or 
heart ? 
And the mark which he shall secure, the penciled 
record of his worth? Oh! the blight of this marking 
upon all true scholarship and healthful growth! blight- 
ing alike to teacher and pupil—presenting to the pupil 
unworthy and dwarfing motives, and barring the teacher 
from his proud privilege of instructing and molding the 
character and life, and reducing him to the low level of 
the billiard-marker. 
Not for a mark is the recitation held ; but to give a 
new impulse, to point the way to more assured success. 
But this fixed attention, this keen thought and close 
reasoning, however secured and however pleasing and 
inspiring it may be, is work, and the stronger the*mag- 
netic force the more exhaustive the effort. Mental ex- 
ertion, too, like physical, has its limits. 
An hour of true recitation, discussing topics of inter- 
est, giving the arguments pro and con, enlivening the 
dry statement with lively illustration, should have had 
quite as much time for preparation. No student should 
come to the recitation, to the elaboration of a subject in 
history, literature, mathematics, or science, who has not

THE CLASS RECITATION. 135 
In the early grades, before the little ones can study 
by themselves, save in some little diversion, some busy 
work with objects, the recitation is not, in any true 
sense, a recitation, but an exercise, which should be 
brief, bright, and interesting. Five or ten minutes will 
be enough for the little work, speedily to be repeated. 
And in the higher primary grades no lessons should 
be assigned, I think, for home study. The confinement 
of the school-hours is enough, and the leisure time out of 
school should be employed in developing their physical 
nature, in becoming familiar with their surroundings, in 
learning something of life, of nature, and in searching 
out the hidden, the mysterious meaning of the thousand 
things around them. 
In the grammar grades, too, at least one half, or in 
the higher classes, one third, of the school-hours should 
be left for study. No lessons for home study in the 
primary grades should be possible, and in the grammar 
and high school grades very little should be assigned for 
preparation out of school. Give the little fourth grader 
a book to read, if you will, a book that he can not help 
reading, that he will want to read aloud to his parents ; 
but not a spelling-lesson to be learned, to be written ten 
times; a page of history to memorize; some puzzling 
problems to solve ; or composition to be written by his 
parents or older sisters. 
The lessons should, for the most part, be prepared in 
school. The hours, before and after school, are little 
enough for healthful growth, for becoming acquainted 
with the inner and the outer duties of home and real 
life, and for that knowledge above and beyond all school 
instruction, which every boy who is a boy must have, 
and for which many a girl might barter much of her 
acquirements in music and drawing.

  136 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
The teacher who allows the pupil, after answering a 
question or two, to turn to some other pursuit may not 
be wholly wrong; she leaves some time for study, but 
she greatly discounts her own power and influence, and 
sinks herself into a very insignificant factor of the real 
school-life. 
The pupil should have his close, strict, and accurate 
recitation, but should also have in school-hours the 
time and the opportunity for preparing himself for the 
proper presentation of the assigned subject for the day 
and the hour of recitation. There can be no true per- 
formance without due preparation. 
Closely connected with this home study is associated 
in my mind another practice, once so common, and 
which can hardly be too strongly condemned. I mean 
the practice of keeping after school, formerly the reserve 
force of so many a teacher, and one of the greatest wrongs 
in the schools of to-day, doing more to hinder progress, 
to deaden interest, to dwarf ambition, and cause a dis- 
taste, a hatred of school, school duties, and school privi- 
leges, than all other influences combined. 
Keeping after school fails, and must fail, to promote 
good conduct, to secure well-prepared lessons, to incite 
ambition, to awaken exertion, or encourage good attend- 
ance. The results are, in my judgment, like the early 
thoughts of the sons of men, eyil and only evil continu- 
ally. 
Isometimes wish I had the gift to express, in a way 
to be fully understood, my utter abhorrence of this prac- 
tice of keeping after school. Never have I known of a 
pupil renewed, reformed, reclaimed, or reconciled to his 
surroundings by being kept after school, by making edu- 
cation a punishment—that first resource of the incom- 
petent teacher.
-P-A-G-E-153
  THE CLASS RECITATION, 187 
By some chance, or mischance, he comes in five min- 
utes late—<‘‘ Fifteen minutes after school.” He stumbles 
in hurrying to his seat—‘‘ Remain after school.” He 
makes a mistake in recitation—‘‘ Make it up after 
school.” He whispers, winks with one eye—‘ Stay after 
school.” He asks to leave the room—‘‘T'wenty min- 
utes after school.” He fails to respond to a querulous 
or sarcastic question—“I will see you after school.” 
And if he ever succeeds in any business or calling, or 
has any interest or happiness in life, it will assuredly be 
after school, school methods, and school ma’ams have 
gone by. 
If the room can not be controlled, why prulong the 
agony after teacher and pupil should have been relieved 
of the unwholesome air and vicious influences of weary 
hours and unrestrained disorder ? If the lessons are un- 
prepared, quicken the ambition and revive the spirit of 
improvement and useful acquisition by some curious in- 
quiry, some ingenious device, and by prompt and pleas- 
ant dismissal, with an inspiring ‘‘ good-night,” but do 
not look for a renewed love of learning and a higher re- 
spect for authority from this ruinous resort of the incom- 
petent, keeping after school. 
To secure this close, untiring attention—the first 
essential of a successful recitation—there must be in the 
mind of the teacher a clear and well-defined conception 
of what is to be done, the points to be gained, and the 
conclusions to be reached, so that ambition may not be 
dulled and curiosity extinguished by misdirected effort 
and fruitless endeavor. The truth, as yet ungrasped, 
should be placed so temptingly near that indifference to 
its possession shall become an impossibility, and earnest 
exertion a delight. 
We do not expect the blindfolded child to develop

useful strength or secure available wisdom by groping 
with outstretched hands and tripping feet among mis- 
placed chairs and tables, however he may while away a 
few idle minutes for the amusement of his elusive play- 
mates. Nor is he the wise tourist who, for the larger ex- 
perience, dismisses his Alpine guides, expecting himself 
to find the safer paths and the wider outlooks, the bet- 
ter resting-places, and to gain the loftier peaks. He is 
likely to return, however, if he return at all, a sadder, if 
not a wiser man. j 
A thorough knowledge of the subject to be consid- 
ered—much beyond the limits of the lesson—a knowledge 
of what will be important in the future, and what forms 
a mere stepping-stone to what lies farther on, its rela- 
tions to other topics, will greatly aid the teacher in guid- 
ing the eager pupil to the speediest and best results ; will 
save from many a fruitless digression, wearisome repeti- 
tion, and empty recital. For the older, as well as the 
younger pupils, the proper method of approaching a sub- 
ject, the logic of the exercise, is often quite as important 
as the facts to belearned. In many cases the recitation 
may well be little more than a reading of the unstudied 
lesson, with a running commentary of the teacher, brief- 
ly showing the bearing of this or that fact, the reason of 
one statement and the meaning of another, suggesting 
certain lines of thought and ready references for their 
better comprehension. Here and there a question may 
be started, perhaps some incident related, to quicken and 
arouse the interest and thought. For this work, the 
teacher needs, like the commander of an army, to have 
her well-trained powers and her mental resources well in 
hand, with perhaps a skirmish line of fine instincts and 
keen perceptions, protected on either wing by a well-as- 
sured confidence and a wise discretion; secured against

  139 
unforeseen emergencies by a large reserve force of general 
information, ready wit, and close logic. 
Of quite as much importance, too, she should have 
learned or discerned the character of those with whom 
she has to do—their mental powers, their dispositions, 
their habits and modes of thought, their likes and 
dislikes. A knowledge of their associates, their employ- 
ment out of school, their home-life—all this should be as 
open and plain to her as the book from which she pre- 
pared for her work. She must adapt herself to the 
bright, easy learner and the duller, but it may be, the 
deeper student; to the flippant reciter and the slower 
stammerer ; to the pliant fawner and the sturdy inde- 
pendent ; and devise means to encourage, chasten, and 
direct, with an ever-hopeful trust and kindly charity ; 
an unsuspecting watchfulness and an unfailing personal 
interest. 
Sometimes, too, the firm authority and timely severity 
find their true place. 
The mere hearing of lessons, the asking of questions, 
however scholarly, and couched in choicest language, 
with no apparent personal interest in the success, the in- 
dividual welfare of the pupil, will not win in this mental 
conflict. 
How many a young, earnest heart has lost its fond 
ardor, wearied of its high, honest purpose, and fallen 
back into the ranks of the careless and undeserving, from 
the real, or supposed, lack of the teacher’s interest in his 
progress. The sharp censure, so that it come from the 
indignant heart of a friend at some delinquency, will 
awaken and expand the young spirit, and fill it with 
stronger purposes and better hopes than the cold indif- 
ference of the calm, uncaring critic. 
A great barrier to success, too, cutting her off from

140 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
any sympathetic relations with her class, does she raise, 
who calls upon her pupils by the card, one of those self- 
imposed restraints that hold the hands, the hearts, the 
thoughts of the teacher, depriving her of much of her 
power for good. 
No teacher, I think, can well command the attention 
of her class who is shut in to this practice ; and no pupil, 
unless urged on by some superhuman impulse, can fix his 
thought upon the recitation whose fate is fixed by the 
run of a handful of cards. 
To be interested he must feel responsible for every 
topic presented, for every question asked. But when his 
name has once been drawn, what further personal inter- 
est can he have? And if, by some chance—as I have 
sometimes seen—he is called upon a second time, he has 
a ready and safe refuge in the reply, ‘I have recited 
once.””? And why may he not be questioned a second, a 
third time, or any number of times, when needful.? 
Two or three years since, after I had discouraged this 
use of the cards, one of our active, working teachers came 
to me with the inquiry, what she should do with them ? 
I told her that the best use of them that occurred to me 
was, to open the drawer of her desk, quietly drop them 
in, and close the desk. A few weeks later she told me 
that she had adopted my plan, and for the first time felt 
herself free to conduct a recitation. 
If the pupil’s attention is to be held, he must feel 
that he is at any time to be called upon for an explana- 
tion, a correction, an illustration ; and every day, asa 
rule, should he have the opportunity to recite. Sitting 
silent and unnoticed day after day, he soon loses all in- 
terest, becomes listless, or restless, and ere long ceases to 
prepare the lesson for which he has no use. 
Though it be nothing more than a simple yes or no,

he has had his say, has shown himself a living entity, and 
goes home at night with a higher satisfaction with him- 
self and the school for just that one small word. 
What an opportunity, too, does the recitation furnish 
for imparting information, for giving the pupil an in- 
sight into the rich fields of literature, science, history, 
and real life, f 
The recitation, as we have said, is more than a re- 
hearsal of memorized pages; it is a discussion of sub- 
jects that have been already carefully studied. It may 
be that very little attention need be given to the reading 
of the text, which will be already clearly understood, but 
may suggest relations and conditions well worthy the con- 
sideration of teacher and pupil. 
The mere fact may be nothing to the student, but in- 
directly bring about results of surpassing interest. An 
exercise in reading may suggest subjects in history, in 
biography, in botany, and astronomy. As an extreme 
example, take Macaulay’s essay on ‘‘ Warren Hastings,” 
found in so many of our readers : 
«<The place was worthy of such a trial. It was the 
great hall of William Rufus—the hall which had wit- 
nessed the just sentence of Bacon and the just absolu- 
tion of Somers ; the hall where the eloquence of Strafford 
had for a moment awed and melted a victorious party, 
inflamed with just resentment; the hall where Charles 
had confronted the high court of justice with the placid 
courage which has half redeemed his fame. There were 
seated the fair-haired daughters of the house of Bruns- 
wick. There the historian of the Roman Empire thought 
of the days when Cicero pleaded the cause of Sicily 
against Verres, and where, before a senate that still pre- 
served some show of freedom, Tacitus thundered against 
the oppressors of Africa.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
  142 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
As mere words, one might as well recite the alphabet 
or the multiplication table. 
Who and what were Macaulay, Hastings, William 
Rufus, Bacon, Strafford, the historian of the Roman 
Empire, Brunswick, Cicero, Verres, and Tacitus ? What 
did they do, and why are their names introduced here ? 
What has Cicero or William Rufus to do with Hastings’s 
doings with the Begum ? 
All this is beyond the grammar grades, and yet, with- 
out some definite knowledge, some fair idea of these 
characters, wherein is it more valuable reading than the 
prognostics of last year’s almanac? The recitation is a 
reading-lesson in which the pupils should give expression 
to intelligent thought and true sentiment. But the in- 
vestigation of all this history and biography is beyond 
them. The teacher must intervene, and, by a few 
graphic touches, place before them these pictures so viv- 
idly that they shall remain as a part of their mental con- 
stitution. Nor is it so difficult a task for him who is 
fitted for his place. 
With an almost inappreciable inroad upon the read- 
ing exercise, these illustrations can be placed within the 
pupil’s grasp as no stolid study of cyclopedia can do, 
and enliven the work with an interest which no pro- 
fessional technics can impart. 
In the reading of a class are the possibilities of a lib- 
eral education, of an art and a culture beyond what the 
graduates of high-school and college so carefully infold 
in their diplomas. If we but knew our opportunities, 
the professor of elocution and the countless exemplars of 
what Delsarte never dreamed of would soon find their 
occupation gone, and our boys and girls, instead of 
thoughtless mouthers, would sometimes become intelli- 
gent learners and thinkers, 
   
-P-A-G-E-159
  THE CLASS RECITATION. 143 
The reading-lesson is not to be turned into a study of 
biography or history, nor are all these allusions to be 
learned at once. Enough can be done to give the char- 
acter of the essay and inspire the class with the spirit of 
the matchless essayist—one suggestion here, and another 
there, without serious hindrance or interruption. Some 
of the characters can be more fully studied at home or 
in the school library, not indeed in any exhaustive way, 
but surely enough for an intelligent reading, enough to 
awaken the desire to delve deeper into the exhaustless 
mines of literature and to enlarge the pupil’s mental 
horizon and prepare him for the more thorough work of 
his school-life and furnish some food for thought during 
the leisure hours of an active or laborious life. 
One of the most accurate and scholarly of my college 
friends told me that he never sought thoroughly to pre- 
pare the whole of a lesson, in Latin, for instance, but 
having done enough for the purpose of a fair recitation, 
he then studied one or two lines exhaustively. This 
habit, long before his college course was completed, had 
made him a model for nice, discriminating scholarship. 
It is not often in lumps, in masses, that wisdom or 
learning is to be acquired. The nuggets of knowledge in 
the school-room are as rare as those of gold in the hearts 
of the hills. “ 
The love of learning, of knowing, fortunately, is a 
common inheritance from which few are shut out. To 
keep alive this love—to turn this curious, inquiring nature 
into the right paths, where the search shall be more sure 
of the reward in the speedy gratification of desire and 
show something of the relative worth of the different ob- 
jects of desire and how to distinguish these, are the 
teacher’s work ; and to lead the pupil to see that small, 
but continuous accretions, from worthy effort, hour by

work, 
And before those little limbs are strong to mount the 
rugged roads, or those laughing eyes have sadly learned. 
to discern the miry ways, shall we never reach out a 
friendly hand, or sometimes even lift them us the steep, 
lest they dash their feet against the stones ? y 
But are not the lessons assigned to be learned ? and 
how can it be known that they are learned unless they are 
recited? If we only could know that they are learned after 
the recitation! The subject is indeed to be understood, 
comprehended, made a part of the pupil’s self—to be con- 
verted into something that shall avail him in his future 
work. But whether it is to be learned in the style of this, 
or that author is of little importance. Our school histories 
and geographies are generally but enumerations of a few 
bare facts, some important events, but even in these 
rarely show, by the relations of facts and events, why 
those mentioned are of more importance than a thousand 
others of which no mention is made. Other authors 
have expressed their views in different verbal signs ; and 
the pupil, if indeed a student, should give his views in a 
still different form of words more consonant with his own 
mental condition and delicate shading of thoughts, 
opinions, and judgments. 
A lesson is learned when the student has a clear, 
well-founded opinion of the subject matter, but not 
necessarily when the page can be declaimed. 
The restriction of the pupil to a single book after he 
is old and strong enough to think, to study, is a misfor- 
tune if the teacher is equal to the place. From the 
reading of one text-book the pupil is liable to receive a 
very limited, a narrow idea of the subject ; and when, 
after school-days are over, he falls upon a different ver-
-P-A-G-E-161
  THE CLASS RECITATION. 145 
sion of some event he begins to doubt of the wisdom of 
the schools, and of authors, and, perchance, to question 
whether there be any truth in the world. 
He should be taught in school, in the recitation, to 
compare different authorities, different mathematical 
definitions, to weigh carefully the evidences, and to form 
his own judgments as to their worth and correctness. 
But can he, will he do this, with the cold, unim- 
passioned teacher before him at the desk, with well- 
pointed pencil in hand, to enact the part of the recording 
angel upon his effort, with never a sympathetic tear to 
blot the unhappy entry. 
The arithmetic lays down certain principles, with ex- 
amples enough for the pupil to ascertain whether he 
comprehends them. It is for the teacher to see, by the 
use of the same examples, or by others involving the 
same principles, if he truly understands them aright. 
We adopt the topical method, and place upon the black- 
board a column of a dozen or fifteen topics for each State 
or country —a very paltry and belittling device, as it 
seems to me, if carried too far. The pupil should learn, 
should have a method, it is true, but let him determine 
what are the important points to be presented. 
These points do not always come up before the mind 
in the same order, or in the same numbers. Sometimes 
the water-ways, sometimes the railroads, now the produc- 
tions, and again the scenery, stand out in distinctness, 
and should enlist the interest and control the thought of 
the pupil. To one the civil development of the people, 
to another the social, presents itself; while again the 
industrial, the commercial, the artistic development 
claims attention. 
The dictionary, the cyclopeedia, the map, all find a 
useful place, and even the novel, the romance, present

  146 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
valued pictures of life and manners, and sometimes aid 
in the solution of social and political problems beyond 
the scope, the possibility of the text-book. 
The lesson, as I have indicated, is not something to 
be merely recited, but a subject, or subjects, to be studied 
and inyestigated to which the pupil is to give his best 
thought and best powers, that when the hour of recita- 
tion comes he may be prepared to take an intelligent 
part in the discussion. 
First of all, he must learn to think, and to express 
himself in a clear, systematic, and logical way ; to adduce 
facts to sustain his opinions; to be ready with crayon, 
metaphor, or incident to illustrate his argument. His 
mental powers must be aroused, quickened, disciplined, 
and strengthened for future use, and for those ends the 
oral recitation presents the best, if not the only, efficient 
means. 
The written recitation, in such favor with many 
teachers, is in no true sense a recitation. It is simply 
an examination, useful, nay, in a limited way, indispen- 
sable, but not a recitation. The real uses of a recitation 
have no play in the written exercise. 
The power, the personal magnetism of the teacher, 
and the fruitful suggestion find no place here. She sits 
idle and useless. The pupil might familiarize himself 
with the mechanical parts of a written performance, 
might improve his penmanship, his spelling and accuracy 
of expression, but these are the very points that the 
written exercise commonly ignores. Shall a pupil in 
geography receive a deduction from his credits merely 
because his spelling is abominable ? Spelling is not 
geography. Because he can not paragraph correctly, 
is his knowledge of history diminished ? His punctu- 
ation and his capitals are problematical, but what has
-P-A-G-E-163
         THE CLASS RECITATION. 147 
that to do with his knowledge of numbers, of personal 
character, of climate and productions ? 
The recitation should be oral, instinct with life, and 
full of interest, with an occasional examination, written 
briefly, carefully, and correctly, with all the elements of a 
written exercise carefully noted and corrected. 
So important a part does the recitation, under the 
skillful teacher, play in the school economy, that in com- 
parison, as it seems to me, the written examination is 
nowhere; and I am coming more and more to the 
opinion that a pupil who has acquitted himself with 
credit in the daily recitations should pass on to the next 
grade unquestioned, despite any failure in the stated 
written examination of his class; that a class which has 
shown itself qualified for the work of the grade should 
on its completion be passed to the next grade without 
the test examination. 
The written examination, without any intent or fault 
of the examiner, may be, and often is, outside the qualifi- 
cations of the pupil. The teacher may have erred in her 
instructions, but should the pupils suffer? The principal 
should be so well acquainted with the quality of the in- 
struction and the application of the class that it should 
not be possible for it to come to the end of its grade work 
without some fitness for advancement. 
Rarely, I think, should the pupil be put down or 
kept back by a formal examination when the daily reci- 
tations have been satisfactory. 
The examination is valuable chiefly in relieving the 
teacher from the charge of partiality or prejudice. I 
have often wished that pupils, that classes, might be pro- 
moted, not on the results of any formal examination, 
but on the promise of their daily work for future suc- 
cess.   
-P-A-G-E-164
  148 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
No one, in preparing a set of questions, can say much 
of their worth in determining the scholarship, the power 
of the pupil. He may strike points, important, indeed, 
but which had been partially neglected by the teacher 
in her zeal in other directions, and the pupils will fail, 
while exhibiting a power of thought, a skill in analysis 
_ of character, a discrimination and judgment of more 
worth than an accurate statement of the facts involved. 
I recall an instance in which the pupil showed an 
utter ignorance of the subject required, but at the same 
time, in admitting the disqualification, gave such an evi- 
dence of elegant diction, of clear, distinct thought, so 
much originality, that my better judgment would not 
permit me to pass any other than a meritorious judgment 
upon her ability. 
I have not dwelt much upon the methods, the details 
of the recitation ; these must depend largely upon the 
individual teacher and the subject. There is, I think, 
no best method for all teachers in presenting any sub- 
ject. There are certain underlying principles that should 
always direct and control, certain things to be forever 
avoided. 
Nor should the same method be followed at all times. 
Now should come the topical recitation, in which the 
pupil can present his views in some fullness and elegance 
of language ; now the quick, short question and answer ; 
the pupil now feeling his way along thoughtfully and 
carefully, and now prompt with the ready rejoinder ; 
now with the crayon in hand illustrating his descriptions, 
and again essaying the abstract argument in concise, dis- 
criminating terms ; at one time promptly and accurately 
performing a prepared example, and again applying the 
principles to a problem with different, but similar con- 
ditions ; taking our pupils out of the ruts of routine, and
-P-A-G-E-165
THE CLASS RECITATION. 149 
leading them into the ways of thought and intelligence— 
not machines, but coming men and women. 
But there should always be in all these exercises a 
tendency, a nearer approach to a distinct enunciation, 
correct language, pleasing tones, and plain reason. 
Nor is ease and grace of manner to be forgotten, as 
shown in rising and sitting, in walking across the room, 
in standing, holding the book, and handling the pointer. 
Little things all, and not to be made a means of annoy- 
ing the pupil, but to be encouraged, cultivated, cherished; 
not to be brought into too great prominence, or regarded 
as the absolute need of the statesman or the successful 
workman, but as attractive in the school as in the home, 
and having a larger influence upon the conduct, the 
character, than is often imagined, and almost inseparable 
from those kindly relations between teacher and pupil, 
without which no school can attain to its true position as 
an educating, civilizing institution. 
When our tables of statistics show us 28,000 in the 
first grade, 16,000 in the second, 9,000 in the fourth, it 
would seem that we can hardly begin the good work too 
soon or too lovingly. 
Entering the lowest room, while in those sweet child- 
ish tones come up the simple words, ‘‘ Where do all the 
babies go?” I often find myself involuntarily coupling 
with it the daisy line, ‘‘ Largely underneath the snow.” 
Where are the remainder of the 28,000 who came to us 
last September. 
If our pupils could be, from six to fourteen years of 
age, under the kindly care, and have their recitations 
under the wise guidance and inspiring breath of earnest, 
sympathetic teachers, such as may be found in our own 
schools, whose names answer promptly to my thought, 
some whose faces have long been familiar in our schools,

and some who can count their length of service only in 
months, this love of knowing, of learning would, it seems 
to me, be kept alive; the eye would kindle at the thought 
of school and teacher ; the hand, the heart, the mind and 
soul, would all grow quicker, stronger, tenderer; more 
sensitive to good influences and suggestions, more skill- 
ful to do, more hopeful to dare, and stronger to resist

hungering for that which shall respond to their wants—

brighter promise, and, to the truly chosen, of richer re- 
ward ? and where should there be awakened a deeper 
sense of duty and responsibility, brightened by a tinge 
of higher hope and fonder expectation, than in the reci- 
tation room of the public graded school ? 
IX. 
THE SCHOOL PRINCIPAL, 
In my efforts once and again to emphasize the per- 
sonal influence of the class teacher in quickening the in- 
tellect and developing the character of the pupil, I have 
neither lost sight of.nor underrated the importance and 
. Value of that teacher of teachers, the school principal. 
For, whatever the character or qualifications of the 
assistants, whether versed in the details of the school- 
room, or but just essaying her untried powers ; whether 
running her little round of familiar and unquestioned
-P-A-G-E-167
     THE SCHOOL PRINCIPAL. 151 
school duties, or ever thoughtfully seeking for new and 
more fruitful methods, still with the principal will rest 
the whole tone and spirit of the school ; and its influence 
in enlisting and uplifting the thought of parents and 
people, or letting it sink to a low level of negligence and 
thoughtlessness, will largely depend upon the wisdom, 
the enterprise, the intelligence, the true manhood, or 
womanhood of the principal. 
Many a teacher, I fancy, wearied, worried, and worn 
with the ever pressing and perplexing cares of the school- 
room, with its inexorable demands upon her vitality and 
patience, often, in thought, turns her longing looks to 
the prize of a principalship, as a quiet refuge from care, 
from infinite detail, from troublous boys and annoying 
girls, from wearisome hours of examination papers and 
dull compositions. 
Such do sometimes pass the examinations and become 
principals, and their influence is soon seen in the dull, 
routine school, in the easily satisfied teacher, the memo- 
riter recitation, the unthinking, careless pupil, the loung- 
ing, slouching, gum-chewing boy or girl, who had better 
never have seen the inside of a school-room. The teacher 
who tires of her work, sees nothing but evil in the hearts 
and minds of the boys and girls, praying for the calm 
haven of rest in the quiet office, with its revolving-chair 
and comfortable lounge, may, perchance, obtain a prin- 
cipal’s certificate, but is not wanted at the head of one of 
our public schools. 
The teacher, even when upborn by a deep love and a 
fond hope for her pupils, will often find the hours weary- 
ing and wearing ; the vigilance of the principal must be 
ceaseless and untiring. The teacher, with her little ones 
ever under her eye, with ready discernment soon learns of 
their childish ways, their natures, and their tendencies,     
  
-P-A-G-E-168

and how to check their wayward fancies and thoughtless 
errors, and direct them into the right paths; with those 
of matwrer years and more fixed habits of thought and 
action, the principal has to do, and become equally fa- 
miliar with their characters and dispositions—a task re- 
quiring a deeper study and a more profound philosophy 
to perceive the real causes of their success or failure in 
teaching and discipline, and guide the wanderers, often 
unconsciously, into better ways and to more assured suc- 
cess, and these, too, seen only at intervals, and for brief 
periods. 
Instead of a single grade of work, he must be alike 
acquainted with the entire course of study, in its general 
outline and in its smaller details, as ready to suggest a 
device for the toddling of six, as for the studious and 
thoughtful youth of fourteen, or even the tried and 
sometimes trying teacher of untold years. 
His is the life, the impulse of the school, its control- 
ling and directing power, its inspiration and its hope; 
adjusting and harmonizing its various parts, encouraging 
here and checking there, making his presence felt for 
good by teacher and pupil at once, omnipresent in his in- 
fluence, never obtrusive, but alive to the working of all 
the mental and material machinery intrusted to his care. 
Nowhere but in the school-room, seeing and hearing, 
with keen observation and nice discernment, can this 
knowledge, this power and influence be acquired. 
Meditations in the office and theories worked out at 
the desk furnish little material to nourish the minds 
and souls of teachers or pupils. There are few things 
more useless for the furnishing of a school than the office 
principal. 
The organization of the school, the distribution of the 
pupils to their several rooms under the appointed teachers, 
 
-P-A-G-E-169
THE SCHOOL PRINCIPAL. 153 
hardly need be mentioned as the first business of the 
principal ; and yet the manner of its doing strikes the 
key-note, as it were, of the year, indicating to the ob- 
servant eye of teacher and pupil the character of the 
year’s work—whether it is to be prompt, firm, and har- 
monious in its action, or weak, dawdling, and discord- 
ant. 
In truth, the whole scheme of organization should be 
clearly and definitely wrought out in the mind of the prin- 
cipal before the opening morning, as far as the conditions 
can be known, with alternatives ready at his command 
for possible contingencies. 
The plan of the school should be as clearly defined in 
his thought as that of a coming battle in the mind of the 
commander ; prepared, however, for this or that move- 
ment, should the necessity occur, but ready with well- 
digested devices and ample forces in case of any unfore- 
seen exigencies. With wise and calm decision and 
prompt action should he put his plans into operation, 
unruffled by the countless questions and suggestions of 
pupils and parents ; every teacher in her place, every pu- 
pil promptly to his seat, ready for the work, so that al- 
most with the morning bell the whole school may start 
off, like the machinery of a vast factory at the touch of 
the lever that puts it all in motion, with no jarring, no 
friction, no undue tension, but quietly, smoothly, strong- 
ly, all in perfect accord for the working out of earnest, 
industrious, well-informed, self-controlled, intelligent, 
and worthy characters. 
Little adjustments may afterward be made from day 
to day, as characters and attainments may suggest, but 
by Tuesday morning, at the furthest, the school should 
be in good working order, with carefully prepared pro- 
grammes on the blackboard, with teachers ready for their
-P-A-G-E-170
    154 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
assigned work, and pupils knowing their allotted parts, 
and eager to engage in them. 
With scarce forty weeks in the year, we can not afford 
to spend all, or most of the first week in getting ready ; 
and to whom shall we look for the realization of this pos- 
sible ideal but to the well-equipped, the wisely experi- 
enced, the alert, vigilant, calm, high-minded principal ? 
If it were true that ‘‘we learn to do by doing,” 
which it is not, save in a very narrow and limited sense, 
the principal’s work would now be well-nigh complete, 
and he might sit back in calm composure to observe 
with silent satisfaction the growing prosperity of his 
school. 
«We learn to do by doing” is one of those aphoristic 
half-truths well suited to catch the ear and delude the 
mind of the unthinking. We may acquire a mechanical 
facility by repeated doings of what we already know how 
to do, but we learn to do by learning how other people 
do, and by the aid of this knowledge striving to do some- 
thing better. The mere continuous doing of what we 
can do dulls the intellect, deadens the inventive powers, 
and stifles progress. If it were true, there were no need 
of principal or normal school or any school. Froebel 
and Pestalozzi, Mann and Hopkins might be put aside, 
and our children be left to learn to do by doing, not by 
instruction ; by skillful training, not by study and read- 
ing the wisdom and historic records of the past. No, my 
friends, by the mere doing the generations of men would 
not attain to the school crayon or the ham sandwich in 
a thousand years. 
The whole past of our race, with its trials and its fail- 
ures, its sufferings and successes, is ours, and are we to 
put aside all the teachings of the writhing centuries, and 
learn to do by doing over again what the ages have con-
-P-A-G-E-171
  THE SCHOOL PRINCIPAL. 155 
demned and strive to reach by our unaided efforts what 
the poorest laborer has as his own ? 
Some years since, to a suggestion of mine with regard 
to teaching geography, the teacher replied: ‘I have 
taught this subject in this way for fourteen years, and I 
think I know.” 
She had learned to do by doing, and was just fourteen 
years behind the times. But she still had sense ; she 
does not teach in just that way to-day. 
Not very much does the best and the brightest of us 
Jearn but what we learn from those who have gone be- 
fore us. The one thing that has placed us in the fore- 
front of our race is, that when we have learned one thing 
we have made it the stepping-stone to something better, 
ever toiling onward and upward to the ultimate good of 
humanity, ever sought and never reached. 
With the organization of the school the work of the 
principal has but just begun. Here is the starting-point 
from which he is to advance to acknowledged success or 
fall back into the ranks of the called, but not chosen. 
Yes, my fellow-teachers, though yours is the work, as 
has been my continual theme, and stronger and stronger 
my belief, as the years go by, the principal is the school ; 
the school is what he makes it. The organization, the 
plan of the work is his, and his the spirit that shall 
animate, the methods that shall execute, and the char- 
acter that shall control. 
But what is the power of one over a thousand ? What 
can the principal do for the individual pupils ? And yet 
just here, I feel, is the field of his usefulness; not in 
direct, personal influence, but largely through his teachers 
must he be made known to them; and yet to no pupil, 
boy or girl, should his entrance into the school-room be 
an unimportant event,
-P-A-G-E-172
i i a a A a a i itl i al a 
156 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
To the pupils are his best efforts pledged, but by his 
teachers must his purposes be performed. With his as- 
sistants, by his wise conduct, his earnest purpose, his 
faithful discharge of duty, by his appreciation of excel- 
lence and worthy endeavor, his recognition of merit, and 
kindly charity toward unintentional error, he must be in 
full and hearty accord. His censures should be without 
bitterness or humiliation, his suggestions timely and 
sympathetic, his personal interest undisguised. The 
strong, successful teacher deserves his approval, and the 
young and inexperienced his encouragement and advice. 
His personal sympathy in troubles, his aid in difficulties, 
and his tender guidance out of the meshes of mistaken 
efforts will not return to him yoid of kind respect and 
unfailing loyalty. 
And I have sometimes expressed the thought which 
has wrought itself into my belief that the principal 
who can not by his discretion, his nice discernment, his 
thorough devotion to his school and its duties, his in- 
terest in the success of pupil and teacher, win the ap- 
proval and thorough respect of his teachers during the 
year, or at the most the second year, is sadly lacking in 
some element of a successful principal. 
They may doubt the wisdom of some of his measures, 
but only to put forth the stronger efforts to conquer suc- 
cess ; he may meet with unmerited censure, only to unite 
them the more firmly in his defense. And he who can 
not command this concurrence of good will and unques- 
tioning support of the better part of his teachers will find 
his wisest art of little avail. 
With the consciousness that the principal is with her 
in her efforts, feeble though they be, there can be no 
foundation, no suggestion, for the charge sometimes made, 
that the teacher has no resource, no redress. She should  
-P-A-G-E-173
  THE SCHOOL PRINCIPAL. 157 
feel that he is at hand, and but too willing to render any 
aid, ever ready with his counsel and full support to sus- 
tain her, or rather to enable her to sustain herself. 
Not for every little difficulty and annoyance should 
she fall back upon his authority with paltry complaints 
and petty questionings, thus stepping down from her 
true position, forfeiting the confidence of her pupils and 
soon losing her own self-respect. Few things will sooner 
deprive a teacher of her power for usefulness before her 
class than this habit of sending pupils to the office for 
correction. In truth her highest usefulness is already 
gone before the frequency has yet become a habit. 
Quietly, calmly, and firmly, with faith in herself and 
in young humanity, unruffled by seeming failure and 
obvious reverses, hoping still, must she persevere, trust- 
ful where trust is found—kindly interest winning re- 
spectful love, and mutual regard finding expression in 
willing obedience, sympathetic effort, and unfailing 
gratitude. 
Never in haste or in anger should a pupil be referred 
to the office, and, save in the rarest of cases, not till the 
principal has been seen by the teacher and fully informed 
of the nature of the fault or failure. Often this confer- 
ence itself will render it unnecessary to send the pupil at 
all. 
But when the need shall come, as sometimes come it 
will, the worthy teacher should find ready to her support 
the full authority of the principal, the board of educa- 
tion, and the entire moral force of the community. 
With each and every day should the principal be so well 
acquainted with the character of the teacher’s work and 
her manner of discipline and instruction that no serious 
difficulty could come upon him by surprise or find him 
unprepared for the crisis.
-P-A-G-E-174
  158 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
What greater folly than for a teacher, in a moment of 
irritation or weak despair, induced by late hours, a hasty 
breakfast, or jangling nerves, or, it may be, by the weari- 
ness of too severe study, to send an offending pupil to 
the office! The principal is probably away hearing a 
recitation or visiting a room. The offender meets in the 
hall four or five companions on the same errand, all 
ready for a united raid upon the teacher’s character, her 
weakness of temper and control, and listening with admir- 
ing glee to the recital of his shrewd devices and their 
success in making the teacher mad. 
And when by and by they subside into quiet at the 
principal’s approaching footfall, what can he do? 
“Well, John, what do you want?” <‘‘ The teacher sent 
me!” ‘What for?” ‘Idon’t know!” ‘* What have 
you been doing?” <‘‘Nothing!” ‘Did she send any 
word ?” ‘No, she just got mad. I didn’t do nothing!” 
The principal throws away a little good but inappropriate 
advice upon him and sends him back to his room to re- 
peat his deviltries. And she goes to bed in tears that the 
principal does not support her. 
No redress for the teacher! The considerate, fairly 
intelligent teacher can always rest in the assurance that 
there is no public or private interest to which the entire 
people will always give such full and hearty support as 
to any reasonable measures for adding to the efficiency 
and success and the good name of the public school, in 
which are centered their highest hopes and deepest affec- 
tions. 
Now and then is found an unreasonable parent, it is 
true, but his unreasonableness is not lessened by an un- 
reasoning teacher. 
My experience teaches me that there is no more fruit- 
ful source of the irritation and unreasoning complaint of
-P-A-G-E-175
  THE SCHOOL PRINCIPAL. 159 
parents than the frequent notes of teachers to them, that 
“the child whispers” ; ‘your son looks round, he laughs” ; 
«John makes a noise with his feet, Charles whistles” ; 
“‘was tardy twice last week”; “I caught Mary to-day 
writing notes” ; ‘‘I wish to have you call and see me to- 
morrow”; ‘your son can not return to school again un- 
less you come with him”; ‘‘I told Fannie to stay after 
school and write her spelling ten times, and she went 
away”; ‘Harry pulled a girl’s hair, and I wish you to 
punish him—severely ” ; ‘‘ Willie asked to go out, and I 
found he had been playing marbles.” 
How exasperating, how destructive to the order and 
scholarship of the school any one of these may seem to 
the sensitive, earnest teacher! What sleepless nights and 
sorrowing days are hers! Oh, that she could teach these 
young and erring natures to see as she sees! And yet, 
to the laboring, loving, doting father and mother, proud 
of the bright spirits and active minds of their children, 
how paltry, how frivolous, how petty it all seems ! 
Their children are good children, playful, as they 
should be; they mean nothing bad ; they wish them to do 
well, and they think they do. ‘‘The school-ma’am is a 
crank—that’s what’s the matter ; and the principal isn’t 
much better or he would put a stop to all this nonsense.” 
Fortunately, no one can send a pupil from school for 
misconduct, for tardiness, or on an errand but the princi- 
pal; and I have a growing belief that no note, no letter 
should be sent to a parent which has not been submitted, 
at least, to the principal; that no parent come to the 
school in matters of misconduct without first of all meet- 
ing the principal. If he deems it desirable to call in the 
teacher, well and good, but the interview should be with 
the principal. 
Most of the parents of our pupils are workers, and
-P-A-G-E-176
  160 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
  the need of calling at the school means a half-day’s pay. 
Almost all of these troubles should never go to the 
parent; he can do little or nothing. The teacher must 
guide the childish heart into prompt, orderly, obedient, 
and industrious ways, and she is poorly provided for her 
work who has often to call upon either parent or princi- 
pal for the thousand little things which stand in the way 
of the erring incompetent’s success. 
The co-operation of the parent is indeed desirable, 
and no worthy effort should be omitted to secure it, but 
it can never be obtained by the repeated letter and the 
frequent complaint. These too often result in irritation 
and the unguarded remark in the presence of the child 
which sadly detracts from the teacher’s authority, and is 
the fruitful source of much of the discontent and dis- 
order of the school-room. The truly incorrigible are 
usually from families in which an appeal to the parent 
had better have been omitted. 
And when one or two conferences prove unproductive 
of good the principal had better fall back upon his own 
resources, nor further disturb the parental mind. 
With the perfect teacher, who understands the 
thought of the child, there are, in my judgment, no in- 
corrigibles of sound mind; with the average teacher 
there will be here and there one; with the poor teacher, 
the good pupil is the exception, and for the most part is 
goody-goody and dull. 
The bright boy, or girl, of ten or fourteen years, who 
is to make his way in this world, is full of strong, but 
untrained activities, which unless grasped and guided by 
the sympathetic teacher will lead to infinite trouble in 
the school-room and in the home. From the homes of 
the rich, from the homes of the poor, they come to us, 
and the wise teacher must, at the fitting moment, seize
-P-A-G-E-177
THE SCHOOL PRINCIPAL. 161 
upon these vital forces and kindly turn them into the 
channels of truth and duty. 
No sham, no cant, can impose upon the American 
youth ; straight, honest, honorable conduct alone can 
prevail. The youth has his rights as well as the man of 
mature years, and he understands fair treatment and 
kindly interest. And with no corporal punishment in 
our schools, shall we ask a parent to beat his child ? 
Shall we thus admit our own incompetence, and re- 
quest the parent to supply our deficiencies? Too often 
the severity of the parent is the thing to be deplored, 
and the kind consideration of the teacher the one element 
of humanity that can arrest and save the young heart 
from destruction. 
But the true work of the principal is yet to begin. 
The teachers and their pupils are in their rooms; the 
morning song is song, and the hum of busy life is heard. 
And no more trying time for the young teacher can be 
imagined. Sixty young minds and hearts to be interested 
and secured ; sixty active bodies, fresh from the home, or 
the street, to be brought into harmonious action, calmed, 
quieted, and controlled. And where shall she begin ? 
Much of this first day’s work must be helped out by the 
principal in seeing that this temporary initial work is 
systematic and pleasing. 
The older teachers need little aid ; they start off with- 
out a jar, free from friction or idleness. With the clos- 
ing bell they have their classes well in hand, their work 
wisely laid out, and lessons assigned, and with a few 
friendly words of wise counsel, their classes with high 
purpose, confidence aroused, and quiet demeanor bid a 
cheerful good-night and depart. 
But with the inexperienced, who shall depict the 
slowly passing hours? With no definite aim, ignorant 
12 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
162 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS, 
even of her pupils’ names, with no assigned exercises, and 
with longing thoughts of the high-schoo! from which she 
has just come, and no developed interest in the little, 
loving, helpless, dependent beings hanging upon her 
every word, to which she fears to give utterance—here is 
a field for the principal, if wise, to do his best work, and 
lay the foundation for the success of his school, and for 
the most trustful reliance, and the surest support of his 
teachers. Happy the principal who knows his oppor- 
tunities ! 
The first temporary programme should early receive 
his careful attention. No unimportant item is this pro- 
gramme of work, and should not be left to the hap- 
hazard guess of a young girl who can not as yet have 
given any special thought to the machinery of the school 
or to the development of the mind and character of the 
child. 
The different subjects should follow each other so 
that each may be a change, a relief from the preceding ; 
some should command the freshest, the brightest thought 
of the pupil, while others. may require less mental effort, 
and yet serve as an incitement, an inspiration to better 
work. No principal zealous of the highest success can 
neglect the programme of exercises for the several rooms 
of his school. Upon their prompt preparation and 
wise arrangement depends very largely the success of 
the school and his fitness for his position as a school 
principal. 
The weary assistant teacher will be pleased to observe 
that I make no weak apologies for the shortcomings of 
the principal. 
He has accepted his position for the performance of 
certain and several uncertain duties, and is to be held toa 
strict account for the proper performance of such duties.
-P-A-G-E-179
  a 
THE SCHOOL PRINCIPAL. 163 
Now, apart from his manifold duties of receiving and 
classifying pupils, must he see that the daily programme 
is faithfully carried out, that the teachers have gained a 
hold upon their children and aroused them to the real 
purpose of the school, and are directing their thought 
and action into the ways of growth and progress. 
There are certain methods in numbers, in language, 
which they should follow, certain clearly defined ways in 
geography, in history, which every teacher should know 
and accept, and the principal in these early days should 
by kindly counsel and timely suggestion see that the ap- 
proved methods and systems are observed, not disdaining 
now and then to take a class himself. Unfortunate, in- 
deed, the school which has reached a point beyond which 
is no improvement. 
The excellencies of every teacher and her deficiencies 
should be well understood by him, and with a hearty com- 
mendation of the good and a ready discerning of the 
better elements of the less successful and the fitting sug- 
gestion to remedy the defects, should the principal be 
ever alert, ever courteous, and always reliable. 
To one the word of encouragement is needed to 
strengthen her weak spirit, to another must he suggest 
some method or device to enliven her work,and yet again 
endeavor to impart the true ideal of education and its 
purpose to one who knows and thinks of school only as 
the avenue to a regular salary ; guiding and directing all, 
yet leaving always freedom enough for the teacher to test 
her own strength and ingenuity. 
In a recent teachers’ examination, in answer to a 
question as to the advantages of having a pupil complete 
the grade under a single teacher, I was not a little sur- 
prised at the almost uniform statement, in effect, that 
when a class is promoted to a new teacher much time is
-P-A-G-E-180
164 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
lost in a complete and thorough review of the previous 
work to ascertain what the class knows. 
It is a fact well recognized by every principal of a 
dozen years’ experience that no class in primary, gram- 
mar, or high school ever passes to a higher grade more 
than partially prepared for the work, in the opinion of 
the receiving teacher. This can be safely assumed with 
no loss of time in extensive reviews to learn it. 
Not a day, not an hour, should be thus employed. 
The class has been promoted by the principal upon what 
he deems a sufficient test, and it does seem a pretty 
severe reflection upon his judgment and discrimination 
for his assistant to institute a lengthened investigation 
into the fitness of the pupils for their work. The princi- 
pal should make it sure that the new class enters at once 
upon the new work. 
Lookout Mountain would never have been climbed if, 
after the first successful assault, the surviving officers had 
gone back to see how far they had got. It was the impulse 
of that success that carried the brave boys up and over, 
with little for the officers to do but try to keep up with 
them. 
And so should the teacher receiving a new class avail 
herself of that advance of the pupils to go onward and 
surmount the difficulties before them! What, though 
some expressions other than her own are used ? some 
definitions given in a different form from hers? These 
can be easily righted, if need be, as the weeks go by, 
without disconcerting and discouraging these young, am- 
bitious souls by sharp criticism of their carelessness and 
negligence, or even their previous instruction. She may 
profitably recall that at the next remove her own forms 
of expression and statement are likely to undergo the 
same ordeal from her superior teacher.
-P-A-G-E-181
  THE SCHOOL PRINCIPAL. 165 
By the very act of promotion the principal has decided 
that the class has satisfactorily completed the earlier 
grade, and should allow no fancied insufficiency to stand 
in the way of an immediate, unconditional advance upon 
the new subject ; and no teacher should for an instant 
stop to question the qualifications of the class. Every 
new topic involves more or less of the preceding, and any 
real defects can readily be remedied with no discouraging 
halt or demoralizing withdrawal. Little interest do the 
hopeful boys and girls find in beating over the old straw, 
and gleaning in already shaven fields ; the progressive, 
loving teacher rather should, Boaz-like, take them to her 
heart and share with them the fullness of the early 
harvest. 
Perhaps there is nothing in which the guidance of 
the principal can be more fruitful of good results than 
in the arrangement and adjustment of the different parts 
of his school, that all by a united, harmonious effort may 
move on with a single purpose to a common end and 
within the allotted time. 
Here and there, it is true, an exceptional student 
may advance with quicker step and longer stride, or, per- 
chance, fall behind the movement of the class ; but in 
our schools the average pupil should compass the grade 
within the year, and move on promptly and successfully 
to the next ; and the graduation of a class at an average 
age of more than fourteen or fifteen might well be a sub- 
ject of investigation by the board. 
A pupil who has been two years in a grade should be 
peremptorily advanced without a question and any 
member of the eighth grade sixteen years of age passed 
to the high-school unexamined, that they may have the 
trial, at least, of a new teacher. 
Not till the end of the forty weeks should the princi-
-P-A-G-E-182
fi 
166 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
pal wait to find that the class is not prepared to pass 
grade. The work of the year should be divided, in his 
thought, at least, into that of months or weeks, as at the 
races, I notice, they time them at the quarter and the 
half, as well as at the end. 
¢ The teacher may easily be too thorough, too attentive 
to minute details and nice distinctions, unsuited to the 
present powers of the pupil, but which with the nicer 
discrimination of a higher culture, will prove but asa 
pastime for his thoughtful hours. One of a wider read- 
ing and a more extended view of the worth of a liberal 
education may delight to lead the pupils aside into the 
pleasant fields of learning and amuse them with the 
curiosities of literature, science, or philosophy. And 
there are those who become so attached to the little ones 
committed to their care, that they fain would hold them 
a little longer and finish the beautiful work which no 
one else, they fancy, can do so well. 
But it surely is a mistaken affection that holds back 
the pupil from the speedy accomplishment of his task ; a 
false enthusiasm that would luxuriate among the beauties 
of a culture which can be truly discerned only by the 
mature and finely trained mind ; a foolish pride or am- 
bition that seeks or expects to know or teach all of every- 
thing or anything. With no uncertain or flagging step 
should the classes, as the months and years go on, pass 
from topic to topic and from grade to grade, promptly 
and surely according to the outlined course, with full 
ranks and ever growing powers and developed characters, 
under the watchful, wise direction of the competent 
principal. 
The examinations, too, should be within his knowledge 
and control. I have sometimes heard the complaint of 
principals that ‘‘the examination had taken him com-  
-P-A-G-E-183
  THE SCHOOL PRINCIPAL. 167 
pletely by surprise ; that the class had gone all to pieces.” 
What real room for surprise except that he had not him- 
self known it sooner? Where have been his eyes, his 
ears, his thought, his untiring effort for the last forty 
weeks ? Perhaps in his office considering how teaching 
might be made a profession ; possibly wondering at the 
public depreciation of the worth of the public school 
and the consequent inadequacy of the principal’s salary ; 
or sometimes, it may be, pitying the littleness of those 
who can be content to attend teachers’ meetings month 
after month and year after year, discussing the same old 
questions, and labeling as new what they have had for 
twenty years. 
He has a poor teacher! Then it should not have 
been a surprise ; he should have known it before the end 
of the second week; should have heard and known 
whether they could read audibly, clearly, intelligently ; 
whether they could comprehend a plain question and 
answer thoughtfully ; whether they understood fractions, 
could compute interest, draw an outline map, get the 
dimensions of a given field without turning to the book 
for the rule, or could avail himself of a short cut to the 
result. 
The discipline should not be suffered to become such 
as to make study impossible, nor the instruction such as 
to leave progress doubtful. His influence should pervade 
the poor room like the sunlight, filling it with light and 
warmth even into its foulest corners, that the hearts of 
teacher and pupils may fairly glow with desire and hope 
of something better, nobler. No real examination should 
be given for which he has not prepared or approved the 
questions, which should fairly fill, but not exceed the 
requirements of the course ; and he should be so familiar 
with the aim, the methods, and results of the teacher’s 
 
-P-A-G-E-184

efforts that he might safely promote a class without a 
stated examination. 
Few, very few, are the teachers, who can not become 
fairly earnest, faithful, efficient workers under the kindly, 
wise, persevering influence of a worthy principal. 
The principal, too, should so arrange the time of ex- 
aminations and promotions that there should be no un- 
certain delay, but that teacher and pupil should start off 
strong and hearty for their work, at the beginning of the 
second and third terms as of the first, without the loss of 
five, ten, or fifteen days, in doubt where they are or what 
they are to do, and with an impulse and impetus that 
shall carry them on with spirit and zeal. undiminished to 
the very end of the year, till they pass the line, as it were, 
at the end of the race, with the closing exercises of the 
year. 
There is no school, perhaps, which has not some 
points of marked excellence, some teacher, unknown to 
herself, it may be, who in her wholesome influence over 
her pupils, in awakening interest, securing attention, in 
the presentation of some subject, or in winning a ready 
and thoughtful consideration and clear expression of 
topics and judgments, shows an unquestioned superiority 
in mental or moral gifts. There is, I think, rarely a 
teacher who does not present some meritorious indica- 
tions deserving recognition ; at least she may display some 
fault in common with ourselves which we had not before 
seen in its true deformity. 
Not the least important of the principal’s duties is to 
perceive the excellencies and to promote their spread 
among the other teachers, to assist the contagion of good 
and establish a quarantine against the bad. The good 
of one room should be carried to all the rooms of the 
school, like the fertilizing dust of the flowers, now borne

by the busy bee in his search for hidden sweets, now 
wafted by the floating insect in his pleasurable rounds, 
and now on the soft air that breathes around us. 
Let the teacher, weak in one point, visit another who 
there is strong, and discuss what she has seen with the 
principal ; let her visit other schools and bring back the re- 
port of her experiences. In her own school the principal 
himself can take her room for a half-hour, and for a half- 
day even, in her visits to other schools, ascertaining thus 
the progress of her class, or its deficiencies. 
In spite of the frequent complaints of poor teachers, 
they are not all or generally unqualified ; they have been 
under able and skillful teachers, have passed a scholastic 
examination to which many of our successful teachers 
would not care to submit ; they have served two, six, ten 
months under the principal’s eye as apprentices or cadets ; 
and if they now fail, is it not fair, is it not just and right 
to look for the reasons of the failures in most cases to the 
principal ? 
Herein do I find the most important part of the 
principal’s work and a partial answer to the question so 
often asked, ‘‘ How shall we secure good teachers?” To 
the common reply of the theoretical teacher and peda- 
gogical writer, that we must have normal schools, I 
desire to offer no word of dissent. If all our teachers 
could have a good normal training it can hardly be 
doubted that the school systems of our city, our State, 
and country, would be lifted to a higher plane, with a 
clearer and more life-giving atmosphere. 
The normal school can do much ; it gives something 
of the history of education and the work of its great 
leaders ; teaches the elements of psychology in its direct 
application to pedagogy ; leads its pupils to observe the 
thought of the child and the working of its yet unde-  
-P-A-G-E-186
PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
veloped mind, and carefully and systematically to note 
the results of this or that method ; it teaches its pupils 
to think, to think for themselves, to reason upon their 
own closely observed facts, and to express their thoughts 
clearly, concisely, and freely ; it makes them familiar 
with various ways for interesting the childish heart and 
opening up his mind to the study of the things around 
him ; and, best of all, it inspires them with a love of the 
work, a kindling enthusiasm that shall go far to make 
them true students of childhood and successful workers, 
at last, in this noblest and most entrancing of pursuits. 
And yet, with all this, so unlike are the conditions of 
the normal class-room and the school-room with its 
sixty embodied activities that the normal graduate, with 
her training, her theories, her enthusiasm, and her high 
expectations, will at the first prove a partial failure if 
left to herself without the guidance, the encouragement, 
the help of the sympathetic, the great-hearted, capable 
principal. 
Our good teachers must be made largely in our own 
schools ; sooner and better for the fitting preparation, but 
in the actual school-room must she learn to interest, to 
instruct, to develop, and at the same time to control with 
a quiet, discerning watchfulness, an easy grace, and an 
ever-growing power, and by the aid and wise direction 
of her principal. 
Vacancies in our schools are of daily occurrence. In 
one there are always those below ready and willing to 
advance to the vacant place—the double-division teacher 
to the single room, the cadet to the double-division—all 
alive to the work, ambitious, able, progressive, with no 
necessity for looking beyond the walls of the school. 
In another, how different the situation ! the cadet is 
weak, unequal to the charge of a room, for which a 
 
-P-A-G-E-187
  THE SCHOOL PRINCIPAL. 171 
supply is sought elsewhere ; the first-grade teacher has 
become acquainted with her duties, and shrinks from the 
effort needed for a higher grade ; a sixth, a seventh grade 
becomes vacant, and the city must be searched, the 
country scoured for a teacher equal to the place, while 
the several grade teachers plod on as before in their old, 
familiar round, without promotion, without ambition, 
and without meritorious desert. 
Many an excellent teacher do we draw from the out- 
lying districts and from the normal schools; but the 
best, most progressive, most thoroughly in earnest, and 
successful schools are those which make their own 
teachers ; and from no one thing would I judge of the 
worth of a principal so confidently as from his success 
in converting these young, inexperienced, but bright and 
educated girls, into earnest, studious, skillful, and invent- 
ive teachers, ready at the principal’s call to take this or 
that position, whatever it be, with full reliance upon his 
wisdom and discrimination, nor standing upon any sup- 
posed or imaginary rights that may be in the way of the 
best interests of the school. 
Not long since I read in an educational journal an 
article upon school discipline, in which the writer said 
that ‘‘ obedience must be immediate and absolute.” In 
a well-ordered school the discipline should make a small 
demand upon the teacher’s time or strength—should not - 
be as the same writer states, ‘‘the most painful part of a 
teacher’s work,” but kindly, loving, winning. What more 
pleasing than to observe with watchful care the daily 
development of the mind, the will, the character ? 
“Obedience immediate and absolute” ? For the soldier 
on the battle’s edge—yes ; but for the child with his in- 
stincts of self-hood, his budding reason, his untrained 
will, and his intuitions of freedom, the thing is unreason-
-P-A-G-E-188

172 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
able, absurd, and impossible. Which of us can at all 
times control his will or command his attention to a dull 
discourse, a stupid book, or an uninteresting recital ? 
Prompt and cheerful compliance, I admit; but ‘‘im- 
mediate and absolute”? the words savor of the drill- 
master, the martinet, the tyrant, the despot, rather than 
of the teacher and guide of youth, and are destructive of 
all true education and worthy development. 
With the quality of the discipline of the school the 
principal has much to do; the animating spirit that 
shall give shape to it all is his. Obedience, indeed, is a 
necessity, but an obedience based upon a respect for 
authority and an appreciation of good order and regard 
for a respected teacher. 
I should probably be misunderstood if I should say, 
as I firmly believe, that the principal should always sus- 
tain the teacher ; he should make her fee/, should let the 
pupil énow that he is with her, even when in error, as a 
firm and faithful friend and support. And in any un- 
toward event should he kindly see her through and out 
of her difficulties before the thought of censure has taken 
shape. Not censure, but counsel, should be his, showing 
where was the error; how the direct issue might have 
been judiciously avoided and the insubordinate pupil led 
and lifted to a wiser way and a higher life, where the 
beauty of order and the necessity of subjection to reason 
and properly constituted authority would be clearly dis- 
cerned and gladly acknowledged. 
The principal, too, has much to do with the mental 
growth of his teachers. Our teachers’ meetings are of 
necessity largely given to the discussion of methods, of 
the ways and means of school-teaching. She who would 
make teaching a profession must know of the underlying 
principles of which these methods are but the flower,  
-P-A-G-E-189
  THE SCHOOL PRINCIPAL. 1% 
must make her reading broader, her studies deeper than 
the adopted text-book and supplemental reader. 
The spirit of inquiry, of investigation, and experi- 
ment should be encouraged—a careful observation of 
methods and results, and the sound deduction of true 
means and methods. This rests largely with the princi- 
pal. The reputations of to-day are not won in the high- 
school and college, but in the children’s room; nor by 
the self-seeker, striving ever for a higher place, but by 
the self-forgetful worker, who sees in her little ones the 
promise of true, upright, honorable men and women for 
whom her best is all too little. 
The thoughts that I have thus tried to present are 
not the results of any fine theorizing, and hardly the 
conclusions of any formal reasoning, but rather a simple 
record of what daily comes under my observation. How 
often have I seen a teacher, a whole school, lifted from 
the low level of weak purpose and dead performance to a 
truer realization of the educational ideal, receiving the 
breath of life from the living principal, become earnest, 
faithful, and zealous of good work. 
No longer are their pupils turned upon the street, 
lost to all hope or chance of a worthy citizenship, but 
with an ever-growing self-control and an increasing in- 
terest in the studies, made attractive by a more pleasing 
presentation, are seen pressing forward into the higher 
grades, perhaps to the high-school and college, and surely 
to a worthy manhood or womanhood. 
And some, too, have I distinctly in mind of bright 
souls and of high promise who, for the lack of this in- 
spiration and upholding, have seemingly parted with 
their former zeal and grown weary of their unrecognized 
efforts, fill in the slow-going hours with half-hearted 
work and meager results. 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
  174 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
It makes little difference what stuff a teacher is made 
of, she can not long stand out alone in good, earnest, 
honest, healthful endeavor against the blighting miasma 
of an incompetent, unfaithful, unreliable principal. 
The pupils themselves soon inhale the unwholesome 
air, and no longer respond to the touch of her quickening 
spirit, grow careless of their conduct, negligent of duties, 
and forgetful of their own good names and the fair fame 
of their school. No investigation is needed to learn the 
character of such a school; like the darkness of Egypt, 
it can be felt. 
We no longer have the little school-house under the 
hill, with its single teacher, principal and assistant in 
one, working out her own success or failure ; but each is 
a part of the one great system. ‘The principal alone can 
make or unmake it. The work, which in part I have 
outlined, no one can do but he. Much is asked of him, 
but no more than I often see performed ; a high ideal is 
marked out for him, but only because I have witnessed 
its realization and made it my thought. 
It is this that makes me feel, and feel confident, that 
of our seventeen hundred teachers and ninety thousand 
pupils in our schools in Chicago, soon to be the men and 
women of our country, and, I trust, her pride, many to the 
last hour of their lives will look back with loving hearts and 
grateful thoughts for the right impulse, the worthy direc- 
tion, and true inspiration they received at school through 
the wise control, the kind interest, and the healthful in- 
fluence of their school principal.

THE WORK OF THE SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT, 
To many an earnest, enterprising principal, wholly de- 
voted to the success and progress of his school, it doubt- 
less sometimes occurs that if he were left free from the 
limitations of the course of study, unhampered by the 
rules of the board of education and without the annoy- 
ing interferences from the superintendent’s office, he 
could make a truly good school. 
And equally true is it, I think, that not a few class 
teachers feelingly realize at times that could they have 
entire and full control of their rooms, unmolested by the 
questions and suggestions of the principal and his fre- 
quent examinations, she could wield a power and influ- 
ence over her loved and loving pupils that should ad- 
vance them in learning, intelligence, and moral strength, 
which should insure their future success in life, and 
make of them the fairest jewels in the crown of her re- 
joicing. 
But the thoughtful teacher should soon comprehend 
that to the generous appreciation and sometimes kind 
forbearance of the principal is due much of her present 
success and the opportunity for giving to her class the 
best she has to give. 
The visit of the superintendent, instead of an annoy- 
ing interference, should be looked forward to with pleas- 
ure, with the hope that some useful remark, some timely 
and suggestive question may give her thought a wiser 
direction, afford some helpful aid, and awaken a deeper 
interest in the pupils, which shall prove an inspiration, 
an encouragement, amid the endless toils and trials of a 
teacher’s life. 
 
-P-A-G-E-192

The rules of the board are but needful guides in di- 
recting the management and work of the schools, bring- 
ing them all into one harmonious whole, free from jar- 
ring discords and incongruous results; and far from limit- 
ing the efforts of worthy teacher or school, the outline of 
study may well be the most useful and efficient helper in 
directing the endeavor of principal and teachers to the 
most beneficial results. 
No course of study is the mere haphazard, spasmodic 
effort of any one man, but a cultured growth, the result 
of many experiences, and the combined thought and wis- 
dom of many doers and thinkers. 
In carrying out this course under the direction of the 
board—judging from the methods of our larger cities— 
there seems to be a wide divergence of opinion as to the 
true work of the superintendent, a matter the more to 
be deplored, since the fact of superintendency has be- 
come so universal. 
Not only in the cities anc large towns, but in the 
counties and country villages, the desirability of this 
supervision has ceased to be a question; and it is of the 
first importance that his service should be in the right 
direction, if our schools are to reap that rich harvest of 
good which alone can warrant the inevitable outlay which 
his employment necessitates. 
The superintendent has become an important factor 
in our American schools, and if they are advanced and 
improved, the glad results aire to come from the wise 
thought and broad nature of the superintendent, aided 
by the cheerful and generous co-operation of principals 
and teachers. 
The real, efficient supervision of the individual school, 
with its fifteen or twenty teachers, must be made by the 
principal, and the principal alone ; he only can, by daily

or more frequent visits, know of the work of the teacher 
in the different subjects and of her influence over the 
pupils with their different characters and previous train- 
ing; he only, by happy hint and timely suggestion, can 
lead the timid, thoughtful, earnest girl out of her depths 
of despond into the light and life of intelligent, fruitful 
effort; he too alone can best know of the merits and de- 
merits of the several teachers, their application, industry 
and promptness, and their influence, through their per- 
sonal character and instruction, upon their pupils and 
the community—the people who rely upon them for the 
proper education and development of their children, 
their hope. 
The principal is the unit of the school through whom 
the superintendent must make his influence felt, and 
without whose sympathetic assistance not much good can 
come to the school, the district, and the ever-waiting 
citizens. 
Not but that many a school without board of educa- 
tion and superintendent may show earnest and faithful 
work; that here and there from the little house under 
the hill—like that near which we each had our little 
spring from which we drank unadulterated water, and 
from the grove behind gathered the lady’s-slipper, and 
the wild lily from the meadow in front, to the disgust of 
the mower whose scythe became entangled in the tram- 
pled and twisted grasses—from such may have come some 
of the foremost men and women of our land. ‘There, too, 
is the school at Rugby, which yet under Arnold had 
many ways that would not be tolerated to-day; and Dr. 
Taylor, of Andover, alone in his thorough, accurate, 
minute drill, very far, however, from the approved in- 
struction of the present time. His art died with him. 
And, occasionally, may we find a school famed for its 
13 5
-P-A-G-E-194
178 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
benign, beneficent influences, like that of De Koven, at 
Racine, whose personal worth and guiding mind were the 
inspiration and the making of many a fortunate youth ; 
and that prince of teachers, Dr. Hopkins, with whom an 
acquaintance was a liberal education, whose noble nature 
and character, as transparent as his thought, with his 
broad, deep current of learning and noble manhood, 
made him a master in the world of men and mind. 
But Hopkins, Taylor, and Arnold were outside the 
common minds, and not to be judged by common rules ; 
and the statesmen from the poor country school became 
such not often from the instruction given, but from their 
own inborn, highborn natures, great in spite of their 
limitations. 
An educated gentleman not long ago told me of the 
teacher who had changed and made his life ; not magnetic, 
not skillful as a teacher, who did not know there was such 
ascience as psychology, but had that somewhat in his 
makeup which impressed itself upon his mind so as to 
mold and make his life and his success in life. And in 
every school, however poor, raay we find some teacher 
from whom lessons of wisdom and worth may be learned 
—some way, some method, some art, which we would not 
meet elsewhere. 
Yet there is no teacher, no school, that attains to its 
highest possibilities alone, shat in from intercourse and 
association with other schools and other minds ; and the 
teacher or principal who feels secure of his superiority, 
disdaining the thought and the work of his fellows, will 
inevitably in some ways fall behind in the race for excel- 
lence. His instruction in some branches, or his modes of 
discipline will and must suffer in the comparison with 
the work of those whom he ignorantly ignores and con- 
temns ; and his methods, all original and his own, will to  
-P-A-G-E-195
THE WORK OF THE SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT. 179 
the discerning eye and discriminating ear, betray his want 
of knowledge or appreciation of some unrecognized dis- 
trict. i 
How many a time have I found the principal and the 
teacher glorying in their superior methods and wiser de- 
vices, all their own, when to my mind came up the pict- 
ure of other schools and other rooms, where, in those same 
lines of thought and instruction, a far better work was 
done, where broader views and a clearer comprehension 
and more useful applications were had of the worth of 
their supposed novel plans. 
It is not from any one unassisted mind that much 
good, much wisdom is to come or much progress be made, 
but they who gather up the results of many minds and 
combine them into one harmonious substantial basis for 
further development are the benefactors, the true reform- 
ers of the race. He who relies solely upon his own pow- 
ers will ever leave some part exposed, some portion of his 
work inefficient, some point defenseless. 
The weak part of Achilles was not his head, or his 
heart, but his heel, yet it was fatal all the same. We 
must be ‘all for each and each for all” in a large, a gen- 
erous sense, if we would do the best for our pupils, our 
schools, our city, or ourselves, eager to learn and ready 
to impart with a discerning judgment, a wise liberality, 
and a noble magnanimity. 
Nor can the superintendent sit in his office chair and 
work out the problem of school-life and discover what 
shall prove a blessing to the system. He must have these 
hours of study and thought, but from the living, working 
school must come the material with which he builds, and 
from which shall proceed those plans and processes that 
shall secure the progress and well-being of our schools 
and the advancement of teacher and pupil. The super-

intendent may with an active brain and shrewd skill de- 
vise his fine plans and elaborate his methods for the pro- 
motion of his purposes, but too often the first touch of 
nature as found in the child or the teacher will burst his 
brilliant bubbles and leave him. wondering at the causes 
of his failure. 
It is very little that the superintendent, unaided, can 
do; little can he outline in his office that shall assist 
them in their efforts for instriaction, culture, or charac- 
ter ; rather in the school-room must he with nice obser- 
vation, with keen discernment, and wise judgment, ob- 
tain the knowledge, wisdom, and thorough understand- 
ing which shall enable him to aid the unskilled, direct 
the inexperienced, and rightly advise the untrained and 
unsuccessful teacher. His office study and his abstract 
theories will avail him little, unless he see and care- 
fully note the earnest, devoted, and sometimes despairing 
teacher, as well as the aimless and thoughtless denizen of 
the school-room, before their fifty or sixty restless and 
bewildering pupils, often ignorant of their language, un- 
accustomed to their ways, guileless of American thought 
and American tradition, but who are to learn to read, to 
think, and to talk in the American tongue, and think 
American thought and become lovers of our city, our 
country, and our schools. 
No insignificant task is this for the young teacher, 
and no unworthy problem that which is presented to the 
city superintendent. Much of his time, I think, must be 
passed in the school if he is to be of use in advancing the 
work there done. In a city large enough to afford or 
require for the work a corps of assistants, he may visit 
Jess, but the same result must be attained through them, 
and he, seeing with their eyes and hearing with their ears 
and thinking with their thoughts, must still continue his  
-P-A-G-E-197
  THE WORK OF THE SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT. 181 
familiarity with the teaching teacher, the studying and 
reciting pupil, and the supervising, instructing, and en- 
couraging, directing principal. 
Less real to him will be the school-room, less vivid 
his impressions, less graphic his pictures of good or un- 
successful work ; but he may be more than compensated 
for this loss by the more frequent observation, the nicer ° 
supervision, and the united judgments of his assistants, 
and in a careful comparison of their reported experiences. 
But, even so, he can not wisely forego the privilege— 
nay, the very aliment of his own life, as a superintend- 
ent—which is to be found only in his frequent personal 
presence in the school-room, in sympathetic contact with 
teacher and pupils in their daily and hourly endeavor. 
Without this, even the well-considered observations 
and reports of his assistants will lose their vitality and 
ofttimes ineffectual fall upon his untrained and uncom- 
prehending ear. 
One must, I think, have seen something of the up- 
lifted, rugged hills and the sweet valley and rich mead- 
ows, with their green fields and golden harvests, with 
here and there the forest and the grove, with the rippling 
rills and babbling brooks, ere he can fully appreciate the 
finest and truest description of country and rural scenery 
and life. He must know the words before he can read 
readily or understandingly. 
Nor is it as a stern inquisitor, severe censor, or petty, 
fault-finding critic that the superintendent or his assistants 
present themselves from time to time in the school-build- 
ing, but rather as friendly observers, as kind advisers, and 
glad helpers are they there, that by some timely sugges- 
tion, some suggestive question, or thoughtful remark they 
may lead the inquiring, faithful teacher into better ways, 
with wiser discipline and more fruitful lines of thought
-P-A-G-E-198
  182 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
which shall increase her powe and influence over her 
pupils, make her example more effective, and her instruc- 
tion more fruitful of benefit to herself and more con- 
ducive of good to the thought, the heart, the real, whole- 
some development of her pupils in sound scholarship and 
well-founded, self-reliant characters. 
Free with his words of encouragement, when needed 
or when there is room for hope—and few so poor as to 
deserve no word of comfort—ard even to the seemingly 
hopeless, with whom no help can avail much for real im- 
provement, should his words still be kind and inspiring, 
both for her own sake, for her self-respect, and to relieve 
the baleful pressure, and lessen the evils of her weak rule, 
so long as she and her ineffective measures shall endure. 
But at the fitting time, when requested by the commit- 
tee or the board, should the superintendent give his firm, 
though fateful opinion of schools and teachers, with no 
relenting regard for results. 
Thus only can he maintain his own self-respect, or 
long retain the respect and confidence of those who right- 
fully look to him for information and advice, or give to 
the schools and deserving teachers that support and en- 
couragement which are their rightful due. 
The superintendent is no less the confidential adviser 
than the executive of the board, and its members may 
and should command his best jdgment as to the merits 
and demerits of teachers and ‘heir qualifications, their 
claims for promotion, and for whatever concerns the in- 
terests of our schools and teachers. 
Even to the hopeless one, as I have said, should he speak 
words of kindness and encouragement in the interests of 
herself and her pupils, wpon both of whom cold condem- 
nation could result only in greater disorder, poorer in- 
struction, and a greater multiplicity of the infelicities of
-P-A-G-E-199
  THE WORK OF THE SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT. 183 
a weak, harassed, and disconsolate teacher hopelessly try- 
ing to control and direct a room of restless and refract- 
ory rebels, who have learned to love disorder and to re- 
joice in unlimited and careless, because unchecked insub- 
ordination and riot. And when, at the end of the year, 
she is kindly informed that her work is not satisfactory, 
that her class has fallen below their natural and expected 
grade, and that her services are no longer needed, why 
should she insist upon the injustice of her treatment, 
that she has had no notice of her failure, that the super- 
intendent has always commended her work, that she has 
had no suggestion that her efforts were not praiseworthy, 
with all that untold variety of pleading and persuasion 
to which the innocent members of the board have to sub- 
mit from incensed relations, interested friends, and sym- 
pathetic politicians. 
The superintendent may in some visit have said: 
**Your reading is better than when I was here before ; 
the order is somewhat improved ; that map-drawing is 
quite desirable; I rather think you have improved in 
numbers ; your work in history is not so bad ; your geog- 
raphy is not such a bugbear after all, as you thought it.” 
Possessed of any sensitiveness or discernment, she 
should have understood the meaning—that the reading 
was poor, the enunciation bad, the discipline disgraceful, 
the number work problematical, the history just endura- 
ble, and the geography anything but what should be ex- 
pected of a Chicago teacher, and that the superintendent, 
in a few kindly, thoughtful words, had sought unnoticed 
to put her upon a better and more progressive way. If 
the engineer is careless or ignorant of his duties we do 
not wait till he has wrecked a train or two, before filling 
his place with one of more assured fitness for the posi- 
tion. A well-trained, thoroughly educated child is of

  184 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
more worth than a locomotive, and a well-ordered school 
more than a trunk-line. 
If the work of the superintendent is upon this line— 
and such is stronger and stronger my belief as the years 
go by—if he is to breathe a higher, nobler life into the 
schools, awaken a new interest, develop worthier motives, 
induce better methods, and plaze teacher and pupil upon 
true paths of progress, opening and enriching the sources 
of health, happiness, and real wisdom, the glad result is 
not to be reached or advanced by any system of stated 
and rigid examination. 
Now and then, it is true, at the request of a teacher 
or at his own motion, if he likes, he may conduct a casual 
examination or hear a recitation, but all that is merely 
incidental and a very small and unimportant part of the 
superintendent’s work. A much greater, a more valu- 
able service is his than to convert himself into a petty 
examiner and figurer of averages and percentages, a 
gauger of intellect, growth, and character by means of a 
lead pencil. 
Such examinations are almost of necessity belittling and 
narrowing and deadening to all true instruction, health- 
ful development, high purpose, and worthy effort on the 
part of teacher and pupil alike, wresting from the teacher 
her own individuality, the very essence of her usefulness, 
depriving her of every motive for broader culture and 
self-improvement, or for the right education and true 
growth of her pupils. 
Her days and nights, instead of being spent in any 
useful employment or diversion, must be devoted to the 
conning and poring over of old examination questions, 
comparing averages, and in bewildering wonderment as to 
what is likely to come next. 
The welfare of her pupils is forgotten or neglected, 
 
-P-A-G-E-201

and they are made the innocent victims of her incessant 
and unmitigated drill upon the worthless detail which 
she dreams, or imagines, may be dumped upon them at 
the coming of the superintendent. 
Such examinations may tend to uniformity of work in 
the different schools, but a uniformity of low motive, of 
petty purpose, and paltry performances, changing our 
school system from a living, thinking, feeling, and will- 
ing organism into a dead and unthinking machine whose 
highest purpose seems to be to exhibit to the admiring 
maker the regularity and precision of its own move- 
ments. 
What a parody upon true education, natural develop- 
mept, normal growth, and the formation of character is 
this effort, by frequent repetition and endless drill, to 
prepare a class to pass the superintendent’s expected ex- 
amination ! 
Uniformity in a system of schools like ours, where 
pupils often pass from one school to another is desirable, 
nay, essential to the welfare of all. But we want nota 
uniformity of low ideal and feeble execution, but a uni- 
formity of high emprise, of noble purpose, and grand 
achievement. 
And the superintendent, by his quiet suggestion to 
teacher and principal, by his careful observation of well- 
noted methods and of praiseworthy results, is to carry 
the excellencies, the first fruits of the best, the most sat- 
isfactory, to the weaker, the anxious, toiling teacher, that 
we may be ‘‘each for all and all for each,” the wisest 
teachers profiting even from the failures of the poorer, 
and the poorest gaining a new power and greater influ- 
ence, and a wiser, firmer control from the observed meth- 
ods, the ingenious devices, and the ways to success of the 
most successful.
-P-A-G-E-202
   186 PRACTICAL HINTS JOR TEACHERS.    And the greatest, grandest work of the superintend- 
ent is to carry the best, the wisest, and the worthiest of 
each and every school into all the schools, that teachers 
and pupils, zealous of good work, may not lack of the 
nourishment which we have in store, but, free from envy 
and narrow rivalry, with a generous charity may receive 
with thankfulness every good, and impart with cheerful- 
ness, without any patronizing air of superiority, what- 
ever may serve to place all our schools upon one common 
basis of progress and usefulness. 
It is this intercommunication between teachers and 
schools, under the direction of the superintendent, which 
alone can insure to them all a wholesome life and fruit- 
ful progress. 
We, as teachers, do not often realize, I think, how 
little of what we pride ourselves upon, is truly original 
with us. We have found one suggestion here, and an- 
other there, have seen some device, read of some plan, or 
in conyersation with others had some thought or train 
of thought started, from which. our own views and meth- 
ods have been enforced or improved. Upon the presenta- 
tion of his plans by any reformer, some dozen, or hun- 
dred even, at once start up with the cry that ‘‘ We have 
had that for years,” which in a limited sense is probably 
true. 
And, indeed, with the schools, as with almost every 
industrial discovery and invention—as in the case of elec- 
tricity, the telegraph, the telephone, and the ruling of a 
copy-book—the civil courts have to be called in to decide 
where the credit belongs. And even the discovery of 
America it is vainly sought to ascribe to some forlorn and 
shipwrecked Icelander from whom nothing useful ever 
came to himself or the world. 
Under the free light of heaven civilization and educa-

tion alike advance, like the coming of spring from the 
south, with a common movement along the whole line, a 
little retarded here and there by some hinderance, some 
opposing breaths, temporarily delaying, but not prevent- 
ing the gladsome budding and blossoming of the plants 
and trees. 
Those of you old enough to remember the old solemn 
New England parlor, opened only on occasions of mar- 
riage, death, or the annual Thanksgiving, can readily re- 
call the condition of the close, musty, confined air of the 
sacred place. And many a younger heart can probably 
find on memory’s tablet the picture of a school or school- 
room, needing no aid from without, sufficient unto itself, 
but which to one familiar with the real movement of the 
age, fell like the stifling atmosphere of the old parlor, 
killing all joyful life, all present improvement, and 
awakening the kindly wish that some stray fresh breeze 
might sweep through and vitalize those poor, self-suffi- 
cient souls. 
Sometimes the visiting superintendent may chance 
upon the school or teacher seemingly insensible to the 
onward movement, or solemnly resisting his efforts to se- 
cure a better development. The negligence, inaccuracy, 
and the slouchiness which he meets in September or Oc- 
tober boldly face him again in December, in March, and 
in June. His hints and his suggestive advice have fallen 
upon deaf, or unwilling ears, and produced no percepti- 
ble results. 
But happily the hinderance is not forever, the great 
tide of warmth and life with added force at last sweeps 
on and over the opposing obstacle, covering the land with 
beauty and gladdening the heart with fragrance, flower, 
and fruitage. 
But in the far more frequent cases he finds the teacher

or the school failing of the best or best directed effort 
or desired results, and with a word of counsel departs 
fondly hoping, yet sometimes doubting of the outcome, 
nor often finds his hopes wholly belied. 
The word, or the thought which he had dropped had 
taken root in a living mind, been nurtured with zealous 
care, watered, it may be, with tears, and he now surveys 
with gladness a well-directec, industrious class in full 
harmony with an earnest, interested, and smiling, happy 
teacher—happy in the consciousness of her inspiring in- 
fluence over her studious and admiring pupils, whom she 
had formerly met with a feeling of dread, if not repul- 
sion, as incorrigible dolts or rebels, but from whom to-day 
she would part with sorrow. 
The pupils may not be richly clad, but they will have 
cleaner hands, more orderly desks, and a less-littered 
floor. 
No fancy sketch is this, wrought out in the study, 
but a faithful record of not long past experiences, and 
one of my most hopeful encouragements and fullest satis- 
factions. 
We are not all born teachers, any more than poets, 
but an earnest cheerful heart, with willing, sympathetic 
endeayor and unfailing hope, can, under wise counsel, 
bring a worthy success within the reach of a large ma- 
jority of intelligent and cultured men and women.

observations of school-life than the most active and keenly 
observant principal can have comes the frequent reminder 
of little ways and doings to which he can not close his 
mind or heart, or, in justice to our own schools and him- 
self, as well as to our wiser and more successful teachers, 
refrain at proper times from alluding. The teacher, per- 
haps from always having to do with inferiors in years and
-P-A-G-E-205

attainments, from always being in authority over others, 
instead of dealing with equals, very naturally and easily 
falls into the habit of saying and doing those things which 
no one would think of employing with one of you or 
with me. 
A pupil may steal a bite from an apple, perhaps, during 
a dull recitation, and the teacher remarks that he must 
have had a poor, sorry breakfast. His parents, perhaps, 
are poor, and the ever-sensitive boy, stung to madness at 
having his poverty thrown in his face in the presence of 
his mates, angrily retorts, “I guess I had as good a break- 
fast as you did,” and he is sent to the principal for pun- 
ishment. But was he not in the—I was going to say in 
the right ? No, not right, but wholly wrong, but not 
nearly so guilty as his teacher. Another partially fails in 
a recitation. ‘I wonder what school you came from ?” 
sneers the teacher. ‘‘ From one quite as good as this,” 
comes the fitting and almost inevitable response from the 
high-spirited and gallant lad. Now a pupil comes in a 
few minutes late for the afternoon session, and, of course, 
is sent up for correction. The principal finds that he had 
been kept in for an hour at the close of the morning ses- 
sion, contrary to specific instructions, and had not time to 
go home and return. Who, in the name of justice, but 
the teacher is the proper candidate for suspension ? 
But I need not multiply real or supposed instances 
of this petty wrong-doing. You can all supply them 
from memory or experience. 
Alas, for this authority—or the consciousness and show 
of authority—which has chilled the heart of many an 
otherwise humane teacher, placing him or her upon that 
lofty pedestal of assumed and false superiority around 
which breathe no soft airs of kindness or courtesy ! 
A gentleman was telling me the other day of his son,
-P-A-G-E-206
   PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS, 
a bright, courteous, possibly mischievous little fellow, who 
said that he always lifted his hat to his teacher, but never 
received any recognition. The father told him he had 
better not doit any more. What, think you, was the prob- 
able thought of the proud Jittle gentleman as to the 
character of his hitherto respected teacher, and what the 
possible effect upon his conduct in school and his future 
life ? 
And it is my solemn, well-founded conviction that in 
a large majority of the cases reported to the principal or 
the superintendent of impertinence, impudence, and in- 
solence on the part of boys or girls, the teacher, in thought- 
lessness or malice, has been the aggressor, by some ill- 
timed or sarcastic remark, and is the one, and only culpa- 
ble one, who should have been sent to the principal, the 
superintendent, or the board of education. I recollect but 
one such case during my twenty-odd years in the high- 
school, to which, with a moment’s pause, I made no reply. 
But at the close of school I quietly noticed that the cul- 
prit lingered at his desk, seeraingly arranging his books 
and papers, till all the rest had gone, when he came up 
with a frank, gentlemanly acknowledgment of his error, 
and never again offended. Nor do I recall many names 
of pupils referred to me for insubordination, when I have 
not been obliged to blush at the name of teacher, upon 
learning the occasion of the trouble. The intelligent 
pupil does not wantonly insult a respected, kindly teacher. 
So many rooms do I know where the school-life runs on 
in kind and courteous harmony, with the spirit of indus- 
try and improvement beaming on every face, with no out- 
ward emblems or apparent show of authority, no harsh 
words or stinging reply, but pwoil and teacher kind, court- 
eous, and respectful to each other—like friends in pleasant 
intercourse or engaged in sorae loved pursuit—alike in

  YHE WORK OF THE SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT. 191 
the districts of the poor and the rich, that hardly a day 
of my life goes by without some ‘‘confirmation” of my 
belief, ‘‘ strong as proofs of Holy Writ.” 
This simple lifting of the hat, this grateful look of 
recognition to a pupil, though in the primary grades, goes 
further toward securing his respect and confidence— 
toward making- the true man and woman—than many a 
lesson in geography and arithmetic, and is one of the best 
aids in making instructions in geography and arithmetic 
effectual. And surely the teacher can ill afford to be less 
respectful and courteous to her pupils than she would 
have them be to herself ! The golden rule is quite as effi- 
eacious in the school-room as on the street or on the 
boards of trade, in advancing the welfare of man, as well 
in his childhood as in his age. 
The bravest are the tenderest, 
Next in importance to this work of promoting the 
growth and development of good teachers in our own 
schools, the surest proof to the superintendent of the 
efficiency of a school, and of his own success, is the selec- 
tion and proper assignment of those teachers whom our 
ever increasing enrollment makes it needful to employ. 
In a small town or for a single district piratical raids into 
the surrounding country might be made, by promise of 
higher place or better pay bringing away their brightest 
and best. But with our many schools, in all of which 
we have an equal and undivided interest, we can ill afford 
to prey upon each other ; and I know of nothing more 
to be deprecated and condemned than for a principal of 
one school—by notice of a vacancy, by sly suggestion, or 
intimation of interest and affection—to awaken a restless- 
ness in a teacher of another school, leading or inducing 
her to seek a transfer to himself. Transfers are, indeed, 
 
-P-A-G-E-208
  192 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
to be made, on account of distance or fitness, but of this 
the superintendent should judge in the interests of the 
teachers and the schools. 
With the throng of applicants, young and old, for 
positions, the teachers’ examination seems a necessity, 
for the protection of the members of the board, as well 
as of the superintendent. This examination may show 
little of fitness for the position of teacher, but it does in- 
dicate one important element--some degree of scholar- 
ship. 
When, in the high-school, / used sometimes to say— 
and even now do not think that I was wholly wrong— 
that for an assistant I would prefer a young graduate of 
superior attainments, of good promise, and pleasing pres- 
ence, to almost any other; scholarly, ambitious, agree- 
able, progressive, not yet hardened into a stolid, self- 
sufficient routiner. 
This fine scholarship is of prime importance in the 
high and in the grammar schools; and, perhaps, one of 
the weakest points in our schools to-day is the lack of a 
broader, more accurate scholarship in the higher grades 
for instruction in history, geography, arithmetic, gram- 
mar, and literature. 
For some ten years, in my examinations for a teach- 
er’s certificate or for admission to the high-school, I 
have given one question calliag for the syntax or con- 
struction of certain words; and to-day a very large ma- 
jority of the candidates apparently do not know the 
meaning of the word syntax. They will, in answer, per- 
haps name the parts of speech, go stumbling through the 
old humdrum, common noua, third person, singular 
number, neuter gender, and objective case, but not one 
word touching syntax. 
The distinction between common and proper nouns,
-P-A-G-E-209
  THE WORK OF THE SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT. 193 
singular and plural, could be learned in fifteen minutes 
had it not been done already in the second grade ; gender 
is of no use whatever in English nouns, any more than 
person. 
All this, I say, has been done and finished in the sec- 
ond grade ; and why, in the name of all that is precious 
for the fair unfolding of sunny childhood and bright, 
happy youth, our pupils should still be held down to this 
perfunctory farce called parsing, I confess passes my 
comprehension and staggers the imagination. 
And I could devoutly pray that henceforth never 
might a good, honest, unoffending English word be sub- 
jected to the torture and rack of that old parsing—com- 
mon noun, third person, etc. And it is my earnest hope 
and sincere desire that in future examinations Chi- 
cago candidates, at least, may know what is meant by 
syntax, and not foist off upon me that ridiculous and 
mummified formula for parsing. Our children ask us 
for bread, and we give them a stone. 
Individually, I believe that the interests of the publie 
school would be advanced if, without an examination, a 
certain percentage of the graduates of our high-schools 
and normal schools—nor would I exclude the real col- 
lege—could be admitted to our lists upon the recommen- 
dation of the principals or presidents of such institutions, 
based not upon scholarship alone, but upon character and 
true worthiness. The principal knows more of the cult- 
ure, promptness, perseverance, the capabilities, and moral 
influence of the pupil than any, the fairest examination 
can give us. 
This method, I believe, would supply us with teach- 
ers of wider culture, of finer instincts, of higher general 
intelligence, and a deeper devotion to the welfare and in- 
struction of the almost countless little ones that crowd 
14
-P-A-G-E-210
  194 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
our schools than is possible by any other method. And 
I believe the day is not far distant when nothing less than 
a high-school, normal, or college graduate of advanced 
scholarship, good address, and courteous manners, and a 
heartiness for the work, will be admitted to the teacher’s 
desk in our public schools. 
The members of the board of education, with their 
business or professional duties, can not, and should not, 
be expected to know much of the school-room work of 
many teachers ; nor can the superintendent merely of 
his own observations intelligently meet the demand. He 
must largely rely upon the visiting superintendents, his 
assistants, for his knowledge of the school-work of in- 
dividual teachers. 
Thus re-enforced, he is the only one who can in many 
cases act intelligently and wisely for the system in its 
entirety. By his advice and suggestion should promotion 
to places of honor and influence with corresponding emol- 
ument be made. A sad day would it be for our own, or 
any system of schools, if ever personal influence or indi- 
vidual favor should place the undeserving or unworthy 
in positions of increased responsibility and remunera- 
tion. 
Such unmerited advancement does, and ever must, de- 
moralize to a greater or less extent the teaching force of 
our schools, leading the ambitious worker to feel that pro- 
motion depends not upon faithful and successful service, 
and filling the hearts of the earnest, ever dutiful, and de- 
serving teacher, with distrust and well-founded discourage- 
ment. 
No higher, holier trust can be reposed in any board or 
body of citizens than this of furnishing cultivated, refined, 
worthy, and successful teachers to our public schools, upon 
which so largely depend the intelligence, the character,
-P-A-G-E-211
THE WORK OF THE SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT. 195 
the aspiration, and the hopes of those who are so soon to 
control and direct the social and moral forces of our 
loved city. 
Under the direction of the board, upon the judgment 
of the superintendent, based as it is upon his own observa- 
tion and the carefully compared and united advice of his 
assistants, should all advancements be made, and any gen- 
eral departure from this course can only result in a weak- 
ening of our teaching force, a neglect of vital interests, a 
letting down of our higher ideals, and a disastrous effect 
upon our public schools. Nor can the principals’ asso- 
ciation and grade institute be overlooked in this outline 
of the superintendent’s work and influence. Through the 
‘principals largely must the superintendent reach the teach- 
ers and the schools. His more important directions to 
teachers may well be reported to the principals. Many a 
thought and useful device may be given to the individual 
teachers, but his visits are too brief and infrequent to effect 
much unassisted. On the principal must he rely to see 
his thought made fruitful, his devices utilized, and his 
recommendations given opportunity. 
In the principals’ association the prime questions of 
management can be discussed and the methods of instruc- 
tion given a thoughtful hearing, and the attention directed 
to those points demanding special consideration. 
The grade institute almost of necessity is chiefly given 
to methods—the ways and means of carrying on the daily 
work of the school-room. With two hundred new and 
inexperienced teachers each year, even to hold our own, 
without any advance, many an old direction must be 
repeated. 
I have long and often tried to devise a plan by which 
our inexperienced teachers might be brought together two 
or three times a week and instructed in the principles of
-P-A-G-E-212
  196 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
education, in what, with a little strain of the imagination, 
might be called psychology—some knowledge of the child- 
mind, and how to increase this knowledge, how to impart 
information and make it abiding—how to quicken inter- 
est, secure attention, cultivate perseverance, and promote 
close study and fruitful investigation. 
Through these institutes should the superintendent be 
brought into closer and more familiar relations with 
teachers and principals, and from them should flow 
influences for good into every school and every school- 
room, that all alike, with an intelligent purpose, might 
unitedly direct their thought and their endeavor to the 
one object and end desired—to the making all our schools 
pleasing, profitable, and progressive—onward all, with no 
unfortunate lingerer left behind. 
In arranging for the work of the several assistants in 
our own city it has seemed preferable to make the division 
by districts rather than by grades—by vertical rather than 
horizontal planes—as the work of each grade is so closely 
related to the preceding and following grades, and can be 
more wisely supervised and directed by one who knows 
both what has been done and what is to follow. 
It seems desirable, too, that each assistant superintend- 
ent, as far as possible, should at least once visit all the 
schools, that the board may have the benefit of their sev- 
eral opinions upon the merits and demerits of teachers and 
schools as well as that the instruction may be essentially 
uniform throughout the city and each enjoy the advan- 
tages of all. 
Each assistant superintendent goes forth clothed with 
the full authority of the superintendent’s office, and though 
not so abundant in works, should be as truly interested in 
the success of the schools in one part of the city as in 
another, with no desire to improve one at the expense of
-P-A-G-E-213
ee ee ee re etn rT ae 
THE WORK OF THE SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT. 197 
another, but with a willingness to preserve and promote 
an equality of benefits. 
And in any observed faults or deficiencies in matters 
of instruction each should feel perfectly free, without fear | 
of encroaching upon another’s domains, or conflict of 
authority, to use his best wisdom and effort, by counsel 
and direction, for the good of each and every school. 
To the merely material work of the school, the con- 
struction, furnishing, and repairing of school-buildings, 
important as these are, the superintendent should give 
little of his time or his thought. All this can much bet- 
ter be left to the committees of the board, familiar with 
business and business ways. 
And what nobler monument to any man’s unselfish 
devotion to the interests of the schools and the public 
could be raised than some of our later structures, perfect 
in their appointments, their lighting, heating, and venti- 
lation ? And to no public interests, I think, will our 
citizens contribute more cheerfully of their substance 
than to any needful provision for the education, the 
health, and the physical as well as mental development 
of their children. 
At the late meeting in Nashville a prominent member 
of the National Association said that the first requisite 
for a good school was a good school-building ; and yet by 
far the greater part of those who sat around him on the 
platform as the honored fruits and worthy exemplars of 
the public school had, I believe, received their early edu- 
eation in the much decried little country school-house by 
the road side, sometimes shaded and shielded by a pop- 
Jar or a maple, and more often exposed to the glaring 
gleam of the summer sun and the bleak blasts of the 
wintry winds. 
No, my friends, the superintendent has higher duties  
-P-A-G-E-214
  198 PRACTICAL HINTS FOR TEACHERS. 
than the laying of brick and mortar and the construc- 
tion of sidewalks and sewers. He should know, of course, 
of the condition, the fitness or unfitness of the buildings, 
where—and none so well as he—new buildings are need- 
ed, and where the means and appliances for good, effect- 
ive instruction are wanting, and should be able and ready 
to report to the board of education what additional fa- 
cilities are needed, but always giving of his best thought 
and his best endeavor to the advancement of our schools 
in sound learning, healthful development, and weil- 
grounded, self-controlled, consistent characters. 
And I believe that there is no influence for the uplift- 
ing and forwarding of our schools more potent than that 
of a superintendent relying upon the support and confi- 
dence of the board in his wisdom and integrity, despite 
some errors of judgment, laboring ever to recognize the 
deserving, to aid the striving but yet unsuccessful, and 
to eliminate the unworthy. 
He it is who, with the board of education back of 
him to review his action and enforce his approved in- 
structions, can, with the hearty co-operation of principals 
and teachers, give a new life to our schools, in the mean- 
ing and spirit of the rules carrying out the essentials of 
the course of study, and guiding our schools into the 
ways of healthful growth, true progress, and genuine de- 
velopment, making them the nurseries of a wise educa- 
tion and virtuous habits, an incentive to individual effort, 
and the crowning glory of our city.

PANISH LITERATURE. By James Fitz 
Maurice-KEt.y, Member of the Spanish Academy. 
“The introductory chapter has been written to remind readers that the great figures 
of the silver age—Seneca, Lucan, Martial, Quintilian—were Spaniards as well as 
Romans. It further aims at tracing the stream of literature from its Roman fount to 
the channels of the Gothic period; at defining the limits of Arabic and Hebrew influ- 
ence on Spanish letters; at refuting the theory which assumes the existence of imme- 
morial romances, and at explaining the interaction between Spanish on the one side 
and Provengal and French on the other. Spain’s literature extends over some hundred 
and fifty years, from the accession of Carlos Quinto to the death of Felipe IV. ‘This period has been treated, as it deserves, at greater length than any other.” —/ om the

political tendencies heretofore published separately. 12mo. 
420 pages. Cloth, $2.00. 
“Mr. Spencer has thoroughly studied the issues which are behind the social and political life of our own time, not exactly those issues which are discussed in Parliament or in Congress, but the principles of all modern government, which are slowly chang- ing in response to the broader industrial and general development of human experience. One will obtain no suggestions out of his book for guiding a political party or carrying a point in economics, but he will find the principles of sociology, as they pertain to the whole of life, better stated in these pages than he can find them expressed anywhere else Its in this sense that this work is important and fresh and vitalizing. It goes constantly to the foundation of things.” —Boston Herald.

EMORY AND ITS CULTIVATION. By F. 
W. Epripce-Green, M.D., F.R.C.S., author of “ Colour- 
Blindness and Colour-Perception,” etc. $1.50. 
Memory is the most important function of the brain; without it life would be a blank. Our knowledge is all based on memory. Every thought, every action, our very conception of personal identity, is based on memory. . Without memory, all expe- rience would be useless; reasoning would be based on insufficient data, and would be, therefore, fallacious. In this volume the author demonstrates that memory is a 
Gefimite faculty, and has its seat in the basal ganglia of the brain, separate from but associated with all the other faculties of the brain,

Illustrated. $1.50.

be recommended which satisfactorily answers the question, What is Electricity ? he has explained in a popular way the electro-magnetic theory of light and heat, and the 
subject of periodic currents and electric waves, seeking an answer for his titular ques- tion in the study of the transformations of energy and a consideration of the hypotheses 
of movements in the ether.

gad briefly discussed.

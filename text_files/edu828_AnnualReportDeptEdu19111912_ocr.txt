DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 
To His Excellency, Ben W. Hooper, Governor of Tennessee: 
In submitting this Biennial Report it is not inappropriate to 
call attention to some of the activities of the Department of 
Public Instruction during the past two years and to some of the 
evidences of progress along educational lines. The statistical 
tables will be considered later and need not be referred to here 
except to say that they indicate a reasonable development. 
ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS 
In my annual statistical report for 1911 I observed that of 
all our educational agencies the rural elementary school is the 
most deserving of interest, and I repeat here what I said there, 
that the supreme duty of the hour educationally in Tennessee 
is towards that institution. This does not mean that the ele- - 
mentary school can be, or should be, differentiated from other 
parts of our school system. There is no antagonism between the 
elementary schools and the high schools or normal schools. In- 
deed, the life, the.interest, the future progress of the elementary 
school are wrapped up in those of the high school, the normal 
school, the State University, and it can hope for no development 
at the expense of the others. The point to’be stressed, however, 
is that all the other departments of our State educational system 
are peculiarly obligated to this fundamental part of the system, 
that they must recognize that obligation and endeavor to re- 
spond to it fittingly and effectively. 
It is to be borne in mind that the rural school problem i is not 
peculiar to Tennessee. All over the country there is a recogni- 
tion of its backwardness, and it is a hopeful sign that the educa- 
tional leadership is bent upon the study of the problem as never 
before, and there are indications of satisfactory solution. 
It is true that we are in a transition period in education. 
What the school of the future is to be doth not appear at this par- 
ticular time; that there are a multiplicity of new demands being 
made upon it and that it will meet most of these demands, more
-P-A-G-E-47
— 44 — 
or less satisfactorily, there can be no doubt. When it does, the 
school program will no longer consist of a set of recitations, but 
the school will be a group of activities, with its academic instruc- 
tion growing out of and correlated with its other activities in 
such a way as to do away with the artificiality which now charac- 
terizes the educational process and to make the school a rational 
social institution. ‘ : 
Soon after assuming the office of State Superintendent my 
department began a study of the rural school situation in Ten- 
nessee and other states. We sent out a group of questions to the 
various county superintendents of the State, and some of the 
city superintendents, in order to gather certain facts. The 
answers received were tabulated, and, together with certain con- 
clusions and observations, were published in a bulletin entitled : 
“The Rural School Situation in Tennessee.” The study of the 
county school situation had convinced us of the absolute inade- 
quacy of the existing type of county schools. It is not practicable 
or necessary to include that bulletin in full in this biennial re- 
_ port, but the following statement and. conclusions will bear repe- 
tition at this time: 
“The general purpose in the preparation of this bulletin has 
been to create a more intelligent interest on the part of the 
people of the State in the educational situation in the country 
districts. Destructive criticism of the country-school system, 
as typified in. the single-teacher school, has not been indulged 
in; but some constructive proposals have been made which, 
there is reason to believe, will, if adopted, add strength and 
vigor to the system, adapt it to modern needs, and enable it 
to respond effectively to the demands which are being made 
upon it. . 
“The school officials have long recognized the inherent weak— 
nesses and the general inefficiency of the single-teacher school ; 
but no thorough investigation had been made in Tennessee, 
and we could not, heretofore, undertake to give with any accu- 
racy a measure of the expensiveness and inadequacy of the typical 
country school. 
“For this reason it was determined to make a study of the 
situation and to present the results to the people of the State, 
It is hoped that this bulletin, which is based upon this investj_
-P-A-G-E-48
— 452— 
gation, will appeal to them; that it will find careful and thought- 
ful perusal and will result in renewed interest in all school matters. 
“Tt may be repeated here that— 
“1. The investigation has shown the expensiveness of the 
country schools. The data collected covers the various types of 
single-teacher schools, and shows that the monthly cost of tui-- 
tion per pupil in attendance ranges from $1.52 to $3.02, the 
average being $2.08. Along with this information about the 
country schools we gathered certain facts concerning graded 
schools. Reports were made by the school authorities of thir- 
teen representative cities and towns, giving details of the ad- 
ministration of the elementary departments of their schools. 
The cost of teaching in the c'ty schools, as evidenced by these 
reports, shows a marked contrast to that of the ungraded country 
. schools, being only $1.27, as against the average of $2.08 for 
the county—that is, tuition in the county schools is costing 
from 25 to 138 per cent more than in the city and town. 
“This is the first fact for the people of Tennessee to consider. 
“2, The investigation has clearly revealed what was gener- 
ally understood—namely, the inferiority of the rural school 
and the inefficiency of the instruction therein given. 
“The teachers of the one-room schools are not well qualified. 
Few of them have had normal training or ‘possess a college 
degree, only a small per cent have had a high-school education, 
and large numbers of them are without teaching experience. 
“Besides, the very organization of the one-teacher school 
makes for inefficiency. With the burden of seven.or eight 
grades upon one teacher, with twenty-five or thirty recita- 
tions per day, with an average of twelve minutes to-each reci- 
tation, great progress on the part of the pupil cannot be ex- 
pected; and with a multiplicity of small schools as exist in 
most of the counties, anything like competent supervision is 
impossible. 
“This condition is also in marked contrast with the city 
school. There we have, for the most part, experienced teach- 
ers, better qualified professionally and academically. City 
teachers, too, have every advantage in the way of organiza-— 
tion. They average cight recitations per day and devote about
-P-A-G-E-49
— 46 — 
thirty-three minutes to each recitation. As suggested above, 
it has been known that the instruction in the graded schools of 
cities and towns is superior to that in the country school, and 
this investigation only verifies that opinion. 
“Fere, then, is fact No. 2 for the people of Tennessee. 
“3. The inadequacy of the single-teacher school has been clearly 
demonstrated in this bulletin. Everywhere there is complaint 
of its lack of gradation, of its antiquated course of study, and 
the need for revising and vitalizing it; and to do this, new sub- 
jects of instruction must be added. It must be admitted that 
* there is justice in these demands, but at the same time confession 
must be made that the single-teacher school cannot meet them. 
This conclusion has been reached not only by local school men, 
but thoughtful educators all over the country hold the same 
opinion. 
“This is the third important fact set forth in this bulletin. 
“The remedy proposed isc onsolidation with transportation. The 
movement for its establishment has been inaugurated in thirty 
or forty States of the Union. This bulletin sets forth the ad- 
vantages of the consolidated school and its adaptation to rural- 
life needs. The advantages are not merely from a theoretical 
point.of view, but the experience of counties in this State and 
many other states is put in evidence. 
“Tt is not meant that the consolidated school will, by the 
mere fact of its establishment, solve all our school problems; 
but it is the consensus of opinion among leading educators that 
it offers possibilities of securing better teachers, more capable 
supervision, more modern courses of study, and a more effective 
appeal to the people, which will result in larger attendance, 
longer terms, better buildings, more adequate equipment, more 
attractive surroundings than can be hoped for from the single~ 
teacher schools which now prevail. 
“This, then, is the conclusion of the whole matter—the need of 
the consolidated school and its adaptability to our rural conditions. 
“If the people of the State will give these facts the intelli- 
_ gent consideration which they deserve, our rural-school system 
can be brought to an equality with the best graded schools of 
the State and we can realize what we have hoped for and workeq
-P-A-G-E-50
—47 —~ 
for—first-class educational opportunities for every boy and girl 
in the Commonwealth.” , 
The bulletin also contains a brief history of the movement 
for consolidated schools in Tennessee and other sections of the 
country and the advantages of the new type of school. Ten 
thousand copies of it were issued and widely circulated. Before 
and since the publication we have persistently and continu- 
ously advocated the policy of consolidation of schools. In nearly 
every county of the State it has been set forth, not as a panacea 
for all our school ills, but as offering an opportunity for de- 
veloping our school system. It does not mean the abandon- 
ment of all the one-teacher schools in the State. Physical 
conditions will make many of them necessary for years to come; 
but it is safe to assert that a large per cent of the small schools 
of the State may be grouped into larger schools greatly to the 
improvement of the school situation. . 
Consolidation or centralization of schools cannot be advocated 
with confidence as an independent policy. Its immediate success 
depends upon adequate provision for .transportation facilities, 
and whether it is ultimately to inure to the benefit of the rural 
districts depends upon the type of instruction which shall be 
given in the centralized school. 
There can be no wisdom in closing small schools if thereby 
educational opportunities are to be placed at too great distance 
from the country children. The one risk of failure in the consoli- 
dated schools lies right here, and its success is only assured when 
provisions are made for hauling distant children from their 
homes to school. When the two go together the element of risk 
and danger vanishes and the attendance and interest in the new 
institution are greatly increased. This is not a statement of 
theory, but universal experience attests its truth. 
I am glad to state that the movement for consolidation of 
schools is already making headway in Tennessee. A number of 
counties have. for several years been working on the plan, and 
two counties especially, Shelby and Madison, have provided 
transportation facilities for their children. During the present 
fall three other counties have begun the experiment of hauling 
children to schoo'—Weakley, Cheatham and Rhea—and from 
all of them comes the gratifying report that the undertaking is 
successful and satisfactory.
-P-A-G-E-51
— 48 — 
Consolidation, as above intimated, will not solve all our school. 
problems, it is only one item in a general program of school 
development; but, in my opinion—and I think I express the , 
opinion of the best thought on the country school situation today 
—it will be impossible to provide an adequate system of schools 
for the country districts until we have entered upon this policy 
of consolidation of schools and transportation of pupils in real 
earnestness. 
Again quoting the bulletin on the Rural School situation, the 
following program is suggested for the improvement of country 
schools. It is realized that there is nothing essentially new or 
original about it, merely an attempt being made to set forth 
a program or platform, in more or less definite form, to be worked 
out as rapidly as conditions will permit. 
Tur RurAL ScHOoL—A ProGRaM FOR ITS IMPROVEMENT. 
AIMS. 
z. A General One. To give a rural coloring to the whole, rural- 
‘school process. 
2. A Particular One. To afford the opportunity for vocational 
training in occupations peculiar to rural life. 
The rural school should function so satisfactorily 
and effectively for rural life that the tendency among boys 
and girls educated therein should be to remain on the 
farm.

1. The Teacher. Professionally trained. Forty-five counties of 
the State have established high schools, a number of them 
of the first-class. The State Normal schools are in suc- 
cessful operation. The chief argument used to secure 
their establishment was the need of a trained teaching 
force and the certainty of their supplying it. The time 
has come when Boards of Education can consistently 
demand trained teachers and can make a minimum schol- 
astic requirement of four years’ high-school work. At the 
same time the normal-school courses and those for
-P-A-G-E-52
— 49 — . 
teachers in high schools should be adapted to the train- 
ing of rural teachers. The normal schools and the high 
schools will defeat the very purpose of their establishment 
unless they make some direct and valuable contribution 
to the rural elementary schools. 
2. Buildings. Modern, sanitary, comfortable, attractive, with 
suitable furnishings, adequate’ equipment, accessible 
playgrounds, and sufficient acreage for agricultural teach- 
ing. : 
BOND ISSUES. 
Bond issues are absolutely necessary, it having long 
since been demonstrated that ordinary annual revenues 
are insufficient. 
3. Course of Study. Graded, revised, vitalized, related to life, 
" growing out of life’s needs, functioning for them. 
(1) Correlation of English with nature study and agriculture. 
(2) Text-book in arithmetic dealing largely with quantitative 
aspects of rural life. , 
(8) Other subjects of the school course to bear more directly 
upon rural life. 
(4) Agriculture and domestic science introduced as rapidly as 
possible into the grades. 
4. Consolidation and Transportation. The need of a larger school 
unit for teaching and supervisory purposes is imperative. 
To secure this, single-teacher schools should be abandoned, 
and schools with three or four or five rooms, with trans- 
portation facilities provided, should be established at 
strategic and easily accessible points. : 
5. Supervision. Frequent, persistent, competent. : 
(1) County Superintendents with longer terms, not engaged 
in any other occupation, chosen because of fitness and not 
necessarily a resident of county when elected. 
(2) Assistant County Superintendents having special charge 
of agricultural and domestic science work; head of De- 
partment of Agriculture in central high school and super- 
visor and director of agriculture and domestic science in 
elementary schools.
-P-A-G-E-53
—50— 
(3) Elementary school inspector in each Grand Division, to 
-work with and under general direction of the State Super- 
intendent and State Elementary School Inspector. 
(4) County Supervisors with specific districts not too large 
for efficient work. 
6. High Schools. 
(1) Some high-school work in consolidated schools, these being 
correlated with 
(2) Central high school, with four years’ genuine high-school 
work; agriculture and domestic science departments in 
the high schools as thoroughly organized, as well equipped 
as any other departments of the school. 
(3) Demonstration farms—at least one in the county in con- 
nection with the high school. 
(4) Corn clubs for boys and canning and poultry clubs for 
girls in every county high school, which as rapidly as 
possible should be extended to other schools. This club 
work should be supervised by State and county officials. 
By establishing them in the school and making intelligent 
use of government bulletins, we have at hand a most 
effective means of beginning real agriculture and domestic 
science teaching in all our schools. 
7. Compulsory Attendance. With such a system as here outlined, 
attendance will naturally increase. But to protect the 
State against illiteracy, to secure an intelligent electorate, 
all its boys and girls should attend school, and force should 
be exerted when the ordinary attractions of the school 
fail. 
8. School T erm. Minimum of six months, gradually growing to 
nine, with its industrial work extending through the whole 
year, : 
_¢. Medical Inspection. The value of inspection has been demon- 
strated wherever tried. A State-wide law is necessary, 
which counties can put into operation as fast as condi- 
tions warrant. 
Io. Community Co-operation. Not only by sympathy and finan- 
cial support, but by active participation in the school
-P-A-G-E-54
—51— 
activities. The school is for the whole community, adults 
as well as minors. It must make contribution to the 
economic, industrial, and social life of all the people, as 
well as to their intellectual life. When it does, it will 
become the center of community life, and its efficiency will 
no longer be in question. 
NECESSARY REVENUES. 
I. State Appropriations to be Increased from 25 per cent to 33 1-3 
per cent of its Gross Revenues. But for a parliamentary 
technicality, the schools would today be enjoying this 
larger bounty. The friends of the schools in the State 
should see to it that the school sentiment in the coming 
General Assembly is as strong as in the last, and leave no 
effort undone to secure this greater revenue. 
2. Bond Issue for Building and Equipment as Noted Above. The 
annual school fund cannot stand the constant drain for 
building and repairing. The school term will remain 
short and the building be unsatisfactory as long as annual 
funds are thus perverted. The burden of permanent 
improvements should be distributed over a series of years, 
and the wise County Superintendent will project plans 
to that end. 
3. Larger Local Levies. The success or failure of the schools 
depend, in the last analysis, upon local school sentiment. 
The State-at-large can do only a small part of the work; 
the bulk of the revenues must come from the counties. 
Our great duty is to convince the people of the value of 
school work. If we can only do this, adequate financial 
assistance is sure to come. 
HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The County High School movement in Tennessee dates prac- 
tically from the passage of -the General Education Bill of 1909. 
It is true that a general high school law had been passed as early 
as 1899 and ten or twelve counties had taken advantage of it to 
begin high school instruction. But since 1909, under the stimu-
-P-A-G-E-55
lus of State aid provided in the legislative enactment of that year, 
three times as many counties have established high schools as in 
all the ten years preceding. There are now one hundred and 
eleven public high schools in forty-five counties—thirty-seven of 
them being of the first-class—that is, offering a four years’ course 
of study based on the eight grades of the elementary school. 
lt is gratifying to record that the movement continues, a 
number of counties having made the necessary provisions for 
them during the present biennial period, namely: DeKalb, Hay-, 
‘ wood, Polk, Bradley, Morgan, Williamson and Giles. In the 
last named county in connection with the high school a valuable 
private school plant has become available, thus giving to-the 
county, on a small tax, at least one first-class school. County 
Courts in several other counties have appointed committees to 
report on the matter at their next meeting; in many others cam- 
paigns are being waged or planned to secure favorable action 
from county authorities, and there is every indication that a 
number of additional high schools will be established in the 
next.few months, 
ka ‘wo mistakes are apparent in the high school movement al- 
‘eady. Some counties have attempted too many, and the result 
is a number of small, indifferent schools doing a poor grade of 
high school work It-can scarcely be doubted that before many 
years elapse it will‘be necessary in such counties to wage a cam- 
paign for the consolidation of high schools just as we are now do- 
ing in the case of elementary schools. Few counties can expect, 
with present assessment values and the maximum high school 
tax rate allowed, to raise a sufficient fund to maintain more than 
one first-class high school. And one first-class high school with 
strong departments in agriculture and domestic science as well 
as the conventional studies, is worth a dozen inferior schools 
which only pretend to give high school instruction. 
And this brings me to mention the second mistake. \\Too 
many county high schools are but poor imitations of city high 
schools. They are not giving to the country children the type 
of education adapted to their needs; and in consequence are not 
getting that grip on the affections of “the people which guarantees 
proper moral and financial support. I hold strongly to the 
opinion that a county high school has no right to exist for any
-P-A-G-E-56
—~ 53 — 
length of time unless it does something in the way of teaching 
agriculture and domestic science. Every county high school 
should have a demonstration farm, with adequate equipment to 
give scientific instruction, should have laboratories and ap- 
paratus for genuine work in home economics. But it will be a 
long time, perhaps, before necessary and adequate equipment _. 
will be furnished and high school people cannot afford to wait, vA 
I have urged upon them everywhere, in the absence of better 
menas, to organize high school corn clubs among the boys and 
canning and poultry clubs among the girls; to make intelligent 
use of the government bulletins which are readily secured, and 
thus give their pupils an introductory course in practical agri- 
culture and domestic science. This will show the people what 
use they can make of meager equipment, of their serious en- 
deavof: to respond to the demands which are being made upon 
them, and when the people are convinced of the value of the work 
there can be no doubt of proper support for continued and in- 
creased activity. 
It ought to be urged on the people, however, that if vocational 
training, if agricultural and home making courses are to be given 
satisfactorily, larger investments of money in the educational 
process must be made. This type of training is being expected, 
but adequate provisions has not been made for it. It costs much 
more to educate the hands than it does to give ordinary mental 
training. This fact, I suspect, has not been generally realized; 
and, until it is, satisfactory industrial training in the schools need 
not be expected. 
It will not do to conclude from this recital that there is any- 
thing discouraging about the county high school movement. 
Far from it and directly to the contrary. There are already 
some really first-class county high schools in the State and they 
are responding to the needs of country people in a most satisfac- 
tory manner. In nearly every school courses in theoretic agri- 
culture are offered; and in some—to be exact, 10— demonstration 
farms have been provided and practical scientific agricultural 
instruction is given. A group of fine young fellows, specially 
trained in agriculture, is at work in the county schools, and their 
influence is being felt, not only by students, but by their parents 
and in the material development of their counties. Domestic
-P-A-G-E-57

science departments have also been introduced into a number of 
schools. In many-cases they have’ only meager equipment, 
in others it is reasonably good. Wherever such work is being 
done the interest of pupils and parents is intensified, and the effect 
in the general community life is evident. 
It should be added also that there is scarcely a high school 
in the State which is not affecting for good the elementary schools 
of the surrounding country. Whenever a county levies a high 
school tax and puts a high school into operation, almost immedi- 
ately the other schools of the county are benefited. The very 
fact of longer terms for high schools is causing the people to take 
notice and to think of longer terms for the elementary schools. 
‘The incentive to pupils of lower grades which the high schools 
give, the help given to the teaching force of the county schools, 
all contribute to the general school situation. And if theipeople 
of any county are desirous of improving the schools of the county, 
no better step could be taken than to urge upon their county 
courts the necessary tax for establishing a county high school. 
In other pages of this report can be found a detailed statement . 
of the high school work in Tennessee, prepared by the State High 
School Inspector. 
NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
The General Education Bill of 1909 provided for the estab- 
lishment of three normal schools for white students, and one 
agricultural and industrial normal school for negroes. The pre- 
vious administration determined the location of these institutions, 
adopted plans for the various buildings, and began the work of 
construction. The presidents of the four schools had also been 
elected and the majority of the members of the various faculties. 
When the present administration assumed charge it found this ex- 
isting condition, and frankly accepting the situation as it was, 
proceeded to carry out in good faith every contract that had been 
entered into and to develop the schools along the lines marked 
out. 
The buildings of the East Tennessee Normal School at John~ 
son City and of the Middle Tennessee Normal School at Murfrees- 
boro were sufficiently advanced to be ready for work in the fall 
of 1910; these two institutions were formally dedicated with
-P-A-G-E-58
— 55 — 
appropriate exercises to the important work of teacher training, 
the former on October 10, 1910, and the latter September 11, 
1910. The work on the West Tennessee Normal School near 
Memphis, Tenn., had not progressed so rapidly, and in conse- 
quence it was September 10, 1912, before that school was opened 
for the reception of students. 
The preceding administration had adopted plans for the 
Agricultural and Industrial Normal School for Negroes at Nash- 
ville; but no contract had been given for the construction of the 
buildings. Contracts were made immediately and the work of 
construction rapidly pushed. ‘No special opening ceremonies 
have yet taken place at the school, but the buildings were far 
enough advanced to hold a summer session in 1912, and it has 
been in successful operation during the present fall. The school 
has not yet been formally dedicated. 
It has been the honor and pleasure of the present Superinten- 
dent of Public Instruction, in co-operation with the State Board 
of Education, to formally open the three normal schools and to 
dedicate them to their important work. 
The two normal schools in operation for the first year have 
had a remarkably gratifying record. The Middle Tennessee 
School has enrolled 718 bona fide students during the three 
quarters and the summer session, in addition to 165 high school 
students and 245 in the observation and practice school. The 
East Tennessee school enrolled 477 normal school students, 189 
high school students and 136 in the observation and practice 
school. 
Neither the West Tennessee school nor the Agricultural and 
Industrial Normal School was in operation during the period for 
which this report is made, but it may be noted here that they . 
both have started off with large enrollment. The West Tennes- 
see Normal has enrolled during the fall term 330 students 
and the indications are that there will be a large increase during 
the next term. In the summer session of the Agricultural and 
Industrial Normal School there were 250 teachers from the 
various sections of the State. The fall term began with 230 
students, and the enrollment has since increased to 340. 
Already the normal schools show the need of additional equip- 
ment. During the spring and summer quarters especially they
-P-A-G-E-59
are crowded to the doors and further accommodations ought to 
be provided—especially a men’s dormitory in connection with 
each of the three white schools. It is necessary in developing 
our public school system to increase the number of men engaged 
in the work, and teacher training agencies ought to make it easy 
and attractive for young men to prepare themselves-for school 
activities. Additional funds are also badly needed to equip the 
Agricultural and Industrial Normal School for negroes. It is 
the policy of the State Board of Education to make the industrial 
features of that institution especially prominent, but they can 
make no great progress until funds are available for tools, machin- 
ery, farm implements, etc. 
The present revenues available for normal schools will permit 
no enlargement of the teaching force; and if they are to develop 
normally their income must be increased. The salaries paid, in 
general, are not high; indeed, are small when it is considéred 
that the teachers are elected for the year and work at least 
eleven months—ten and a half.months in school and two weeks 
or more it State and county institutes. We must have in these 
schools a group of specialists who can be counted on to remain in 
the work for a period of years; and they cannot be secured with 
niggardly remuneration, for if men make good in our institutions 
other places are bidding for them. 
The schools are established. Memphis, Murfreesboro, John- 
son City and Nashville and the counties in which they are located 
made large and generous donations to them, and they ought to 
be maintained and developed in a manner commensurate with 
the greatness of the State and so as to secure the most efficient 
service. 
In subsequent pages of this report will be found statements 
’ from the presidents of the Normal schools concerning their work, 
a detailed financial report of local funds and such recommenda- 
tions for additional equipment as in their judgment is needed. 
There is also a complete financial report of funds which have 
passed through the hands of the State officials prepared by the 
general bookkeeper of the normal schools.

STATE UNIVERSITY. 
The report. of the President of the State University, which 
appears elsewhere in this volume, shows a steady and satisfactory 
development of that institution. The university stands at the 
head of the public school system of Tennessee; it offers oppor- 
tunity to young men and young women of the State for higher 
education at public expense; by its extension work it is reaching 
and helping a large student body who could never come within | 
its walls, and it deserves the cordial support of all the people. 
The report of its progress will be read with interest by all ‘its 
friends and by the friends of higher education everywhere. 
BIENNIAL EDUCATIONAL CAMPAIGN. 
A series of school rallies covering every county in the State 
was held during the months of August, September and October. 
The campaign was carried on simultaneously in the three grand 
divisions. The State Superintendent of Public Instruction was 
ably assisted in the campaign by the presidents of the three _ 
normal schools, the State High School and Elementary School 
Inspectors, Professor of Secondary Education in the State Uni- 
versity, members of the State Board of Education, and repre- 
sentatives from the State Departments of Agriculture and Health. 
The county superintendents of the various counties personally 
directed the rallies, and, together with local school people, made 
all necessary local arrangements. Great interest was manifested 
in the issues involved in the campaign, and large and representa- 
tive audiences were present in most of the counties. The at- 
tendance ranged from 150 to 5,000, and a conservative estimate 
places the total attendance at all the meetings at 75,000. 
The principal matters discussed in the various-rallies were 
consolidation of schools and transportation of pupils, professional 
supervision of country schools, bond issue: for school building, 
standardization of teachers’ certificates, the high and normal 
school situation, needed legislation and increased school revenues. 
The people responded sympathetically, and it is believed that 
the campaign has resulted in a stronger school sentiment and more 
intelligent interest in fundamental school matters and a desire 
and purpose to improve the school situation.

CAMPAIGN AGAINST ILLITERACY. 
When statistics from the census of 1910 in regard to illiteracy 
in Tennessee became available and it was learned that, although 
conditions had somewhat improved, our relative standing among 
the states of the Union had not changed, it was felt that some 
extraordinary measures ought to be adopted in the State to 
remedy the evil. Accordingly a letter was written to county 
superintendents early in May, 1910, giving them such informa- 
tion as was obtainable at that time, and asking them to investi- 
gate the condition of their respective counties as regards illiteracy 
and to project some plans for its extinction. I quote from that 
letter: 
“From advance information from the Census Bureau we 
find that in the State-at-large there are 122,454 illiterate native 
whites, ten years of age and over. The entire population of 
that age is 1,260,304, so that 9.7 per cent of the native white 
population, ten years old and above, is unable to read and write. 
The total population, white and colored, ten years and over, is 
1,621,179; the illiterate among that number 221,071, or 13 6.10 
per cent of the entire population. 
“Looking at the situation from another point of view, we 
find that there are 433,431 native adult white males in Terinessee; 
11.1 per cent of this number, or 48,371 are unable to read and 
write. That is, one grown white man in every nine in the State 
of Tennessee cannot write his name, or read it when it is written. 
It should be said that this is a slight improvement over 1900, 
when 14.1 per cent of this population was in the illiterate class. 
“What is given above, however, is sufficient to indicate that 
we are failing in our fundamental educational purpose—making a 
literate body of men and women in the State. Whatever else 
we may do in our schools, as long as there is so large a per cent 
of our people not able to read and write our task is incomplete. 
Democracy is still on trial—there are many problems confronting 
it; and if it cannot cope with so small a matter as illiteracy, there 
is little hope that it‘can completely and successfully find a remedy 
for its other ills. 
“T am convinced that the wiping out of illiteracy in Tennessee 
before another census is taken, or at least reducing it to a neg-
-P-A-G-E-62
— 59 — 
ligible quantity, is not an impossible task. If ninety-six county 
superintendents and forty-four city superintendents resolve to 
do the job, the deed is done. No more interesting address was 
delivered at the recent Conference for Education in the South, at 
Nashville—and there were scores of America’s greatest thinkers 
on the program—than the thrilling recital of a frail woman 
superintendent of a Kentucky county of the way in which she 
and her self-sacrificing teachers, backed up by the patriotic men 
and women of her county, had attacked this problem and solved 
it with reasonable success. . 
“Here is an opportunity, I believe, for an enterprising County 
Superintendent in Tennessee to render incalculable service to his 
State and win for himself a national name and fame. 
“Who will be the first to canvass the situation in his county, 
and if it is warranted, undertake this big but by no means impos- 
sible task? . 
“Tt can be accomplished, I believe, by a whirlwind campaign. 
The object is so appealing, so full of human interest, that it will 
reach every patriotic man and woman in your county. The 
preachers will come to your aid, and the churches be converted 
into schools; the teachers will rally to you and give their time 
gratuitously to this service; the professional men and men of 
affairs, the noble women will lend a hand; the newspapers will 
give cordial endorsement and support; and for the time being 
you can have your whole county in school—either as teachers or 
pupils.. Can you conceive of a grander spectacle? 
“The direct effect of such a campaign will be important and 
far reaching, but the indirect will be even greater. Such a 
sentiment will be created that the schools will be brought into 
their rightful prominence, the work of the school will be more 
appreciated and your county will resolve that never again shall 
such a task be necessary. I believe it will mean compulsory 
education law for the whole State, larger attendance, more ef- 
fective adult co-operation, more money for educational purposes, 
and a brighter day for the whole State. 
I regret to say that this letter did not meet with as general 
a response as I expected and desired, but a few superintendents . 
resolved to follow the suggestions and have been working en- 
thusiastically on it. Two counties particularly—Bradley in
-P-A-G-E-63
East Tennessee and Sumner in Middle Tennessee, have entered 
upon the task in real earnestness and their reports are so full of 
interest as to deserve recording here. 
The County Superintendent of Bradley County tells of fifteen 
or twenty night schools composed exclusively of illiterate adults 
with attendance ranging from three or four to twenty-three. 
The consecration and zeal of his teachers have attracted attention 
throughout the county. Matured men and women, who were 
denied the privileges of the school in their early years, are now 
eager attendants, and they speak with enthusiasm of the benefits 
received, 
The Superintendent of Sumner County writes that there have 
been organized in various parts of his county between twenty- 
five and thirty special schools, some meeting at night, some 
Saturday afternoon, some Sundays in connection with Sunday 
Schools; and that there are students enrolled from the age of 
eighteen to seventy-five. Church people and leading citizens 
have come to the assistance of the teachers and the work is going 
on successfully. Both superintendents claim that this activity 
on the part of the school people has brought the school into more 
favorable attention than ever before, and that the indirect results 
of the campaign being waged promises to be even greater than 
the direct. 
Assurances come to the office also from Anderson County and. 
one or two others of the organization of special schools for illiter- 
ates, and whenever it has been seriously undertaken good results 
have followed. It should be borne in mind that the teachers 
engaged in the work are serving gratuitously, that all these ac- 
tivities are being carried on without additional public expense. 
While comparatively few counties have responded to the ap- 
peal from this department in this matter, from the reports al- 
" ready received we are more than ever convinced that we have 
advised no impossible task; and if every school official would con- 
sider the problem as these recorded above, the condition of our 
State as regards illiteracy would rapidly improve. 
But one conclusion forces itself upon us. Illiteracy will 
never be eliminated from Tennessee without an effective State- 
wide compulsory school attendance law. Several times in this 
report this conclusion has been reached from various considera-
-P-A-G-E-64
— 61 — 
tions. It has nowhere been argued, it will not be here. Suffice 
it to say that parents who are indifferent to the interests of their 
children are enemies to the State; and, further, that the obliga- 
tions of the State to the unfortunate children of such parents are 
such that all its power must be extended to educate them in 
spite of the indifference or unconcern of their parents. There are 
few states without such a law and Tennessee can not afford to 
experiment longer with this phase of the educational problem. 
The way to increase attendance, to make all the children of all 
the people literate is for the State to say every child must attend 
school, , 
EVIDENCES OF PROGRESS. 
The general statistics compiled for this report indicate rea- 
sonable and satisfactory progress. The enrollment table shows . 
an increase of 10,000 and the attendance table of 8,000 over the 
previous year. . The financial statement indicates improvement 
in every phase of the work; the total revenues are $695,000 in 
excess of last year; the value of school property has increased 
more than $2,000,000, and teachers’ salaries, including’ county, 
high and city teachers, have advanced from $42 to $48. 
In addition to these general statistics I am giving below in- 
formation which has been reported to the office from time to 
time in regard to improved conditions. Of course, it has not 
been possible to collect data concerning every advanced step in 
education in the State during the present biennial period, but a 
number of instances are recorded here as indicating some of the 
lines of progress.

SPECIAL SUPERVISORS. 
One of the most urgent needs of country schools at this time 
is more intelligent supervision of their work. It is. recognized 
that even those county superintendents who are paid sufficient 
salary to give all their time to school work cannot hope to visit 
schools often enough or stay long enough to render satisfactory 
supervisory service. There is need of supervisors for primary 
work, of supervisors for grade work, and especially of expert 
supervisors of industrial work. 
Some of the counties of Tennessee have realized this need and 
are endeavoring to supply it. During the last few months ap- 
pointments have been made as follows: 
Madison County has appointed a supervisor of agricultural 
work at-a salary of $1,200 per year. The appointee supervises 
science teaching in all the schools and gives general direction for 
demonstration plots at the large schools of the county. The 
County Superintendent reports that the action of the Board in 
making this appointment has met with great favor among farmers 
and patrons of the schools. 
Bradley County has appointed a rural school supervisor at a 
salary of $55 per month and expenses. The County Superin- 
tendent reports her duties as follows: . 
“She has charge of the Tomato Club and School Improvement 
work of the county, with headquarters in Superintendent’s 
office, where she spends one day out of each week. Her work is 
mainly “in the rural districts. Here she organizes the School 
Improvement Leagues and co-operates with them in raising funds 
to beautify and make more sanitary the school buildings. She 
makes a report of funds. secured for this purpose to the Board. 
The Board then supplements the fund. She at the request of 
the teacher, visits the homes of pupils who are absent and if 
possible induces them to return. She corresponds with compa- 
hies, securing best prices on paints, pictures, drinking fountains, 
etc. She complies with the requests of Board and Superintend- 
ent in doing other work, which they, in their discretion, see fit 
for her to do.” 
Knox County has appointed a supervisor of agriculture at a 
salary of $1,800 per year. The County Superintendent thus 
describes his work: :
-P-A-G-E-67
— 64-—— 
“Both the grammar school and high school boards are plan- 
ning to emphasize agriculture in the schools, and for this reason 
Mr. Phillips has been employed to teach the pupils the advantages 
of rotation of crops, selecting proper seeds, proper cultivation and 
many. other phases of crop growing that the average school boy - 
knows nothing at all about. Mr. Phillips is principal of our agri- “ 
cultural high school; the Board has established three others, and 
he will have supervision over them all. We believe this move 
will result in much good to the schools of the country. Mr. 
Phillips is a graduate of Cornell University.” 
Davidson County has appointed a supervisor of primary 
work at a salary of $70 per month. Her work is thus described 
by the County Superintendent: 
“Miss Julia M. Green has charge of the primary grades in 
Shwab School at a salary of $50. In addition to this our County 
Board has appointed her supervisor of primary work for the 
county. For this work she receives $20 per month additional. 
Miss Green has an assistant at Shwab who teaches the primary 
‘grades during her absence. As supervisor she outlines the pri- 
mary work of our schools, and at éach monthly institute instructs 
primary teachers in methods and subject matter for the next 
month. Her duty also is to visit schools and by personal in- 
spection suggest needed improvement. In this work she is re- 
quired to give special attention to schools where I think her 
services are most needed. So far, this plan of special super- 
vision has worked admirably.” 
Shelby County has made provision for a supervisor of pri- 
mary work, but no appointment has yet been made. 
The action taken by these counties is in line with most ad- 
vanced educational progress. Other counties have the matter 
under advisement and it is believed that a number of super- 
visors of special phases of country school work will be appointed 
within the next few months. We are urging this matter upon 
county authorities because we believe it is an absolutely 
necessary step. . , 
CONSOLIDATION AND TRANSPORTATION. 
Attention has already been called to the progress of the con- 
solidation movement in Tennessee, but it is proper to repeat 
here the recent developments along this line.

Consolidation is not always accompanied by transportation. 
A large number of small schools have been abandoned during 
the year and larger schools established without endangering the 
attendance record by placing the school too far away from its 
students. Approximately 150 small schools have been closed 
during the year and grouped into 50 or 75 larger units. Con- 
solidations of this character have been going on for a number of 
years and. need no further reference here. 
It is encouraging to note that the campaigning which has 
been done‘in favor of consolidation with transportation is already 
showing results. In addition to the pioneer counties, Shelby and 
Madison, which have been using school wagons for a number of 
years.in.connection with their consolidated schools, we can now re-, 
port three other counties which, for the first time this fall, have 
begun the experiment. It is true they are doing it on a small 
scale, but the reports which come from Weakley, Cheatham and 
Rhea, where wagons have recently been put into use, show that 
the policy is meeting with great favor among the people, and 
that there is every reason to hope for its extension. 
Crus Work Amonc Boys AND GIRLS. 
Among the most efficient agencies which have been devised 
for vitalizing country schools and unifying the schools and com- 
community life are the clubs which have been organized among 
the young men ‘and young women. The Boys’ Corn Clubs have. 
been.in operation for several years and have had a most remark- 
able influence, material and otherwise, in this and other states. 
The present administration has done what it could to co-operate 
with the United States Government demonstrators in further- 
ing the Corn Club movement, and it is gratifying to report that 
the number of clubs in the State have largely increased this 
year, and the records which are now coming in show that the 
efforts of the young men have been rewarded, not only in larger 
yields, but in better quality of product. 
_ It was not until the present year that the Girls’ Canning and 
Poultry Club work was inaugurated in Tennessee. Miss Vir- 
ginia P: Moore, who has for a number of years efficiently carried 
on the school improvement work, was given the additional duties 
3
-P-A-G-E-71
— 66 — 
of organizing Canning and Poultry Clubs—more familiarly 
known as ‘‘Tomato Clubs’—among the young women of the 
various counties of Tennessee. There was no effort on her 
part to put:‘the work in a-large number of counties this year, but 
rather to concentrate on a few where collaborators could be se- 
cured and the work could be carried on under intelligent super- 
vision. The success of the movement has far surpassed all ex- 
- pectation. The young women have demonstrated their ability 
to make some contribution to economic and industrial life and, 
have shown real business ability. Their work has’ attracted 
attention, not only in their particular counties, but at the State 
Fair and other-places. I have asked Miss Moore to prepare a 
full report of her work, which has been done and appears at other 
places in this report. 
As already indicated, this club work is far-reaching in its 
value, not only upon community life, but upon school life as 
well. One of the strongest criticisms of the school grows. out 
of its artificiality, its aloofness from real life, its .apparent lack 
of interest in life. The establishment of corn clubs and tomato 
clubs by the schools, and the participation of the young people 
in them will show that the schools are functioning for the in- 
’ dustrial and economic life of the people, as well as the intellectual 
life, and will effectively dispose of all criticism. I wish we could 
correlate this club work more closely with the academic instruc- 
.tion which is now being given. I wish the State of Tennessee 
and the various counties could appoint supervisors to take 
charge of and develop it, and not depend, as they do now, upon 
the meager help which comes from the United States Department 
of Agriculture. 
County ScHOOL Fairs. 
Another movement recently inaugurated in ‘Tennessee which 
has done a great deal to develop the industrial féatures of country 
school work is the County School Fair. A number of counties 
during the present year have had splendid exhibits of their in- 
dustrial work, especially those made by the corn clubs and to- 
mato clubs. There may be mentioned in this connection ex- 
hibitions given in Lawrence, Wilson, Giles, Hamilton, Benton, 
Smith, and other counties, perhaps, which have not reported to
-P-A-G-E-72
— 67 — 
this office. But the most elaborate organization of the kind is 
the Montgomery County Industrial School Fair, which was held 
at Clarksville, November 15 and 16, of this year. The mer- 
chants of Clarksville and the surrounding county offered liberal 
prizes and stimulated the school children in all parts of the 
county to make entries. In an announcement published by the 
school people, of the city and county the aims and purposes of 
the fair were thus set forth: , , 
“The County Fair does its work in two directions. First, 
it sums up the work of the Boys’ Corn Clubs and Girls’ Tomato 
Clubs, the Sewing and Cooking Clubs, Poultry Clubs, etc., and 
associates the social life of the boy and girl with school life. 
Too long has the child been taught in the school room things 
foreign to his social environment. The parents, both in the 
country and in the city, have a right to expect their children to 
be better able to do the common things of life by attending 
school, whether they be in the corn field, in the kitchen, behind 
the counter or in the social club world. The School Fair is 
laboring to accomplish this in the school. Second, it will pro- 
mote the above named organizations, and other features along 
the line of school improvement work, where it before has been 
neglected, and will encourage their continuance and enlargement 
in communities where they are already doing well. It gathers 
up results and thus gives forth enthusiasm, encouragement and 
definite direction for an enlargement of educational, economical 
and social work, 
The School Fair is a composite picture of the children’s 
work. As it will bring together exhibits from’ many schools of 
the county, it will enlarge the outlook of the school community 
and cause the children to measure themselves by the children of 
other schools. 
The athletic contests, the declamations, the exhibits in corn 
raising, corn judging, tomato raising and tobacco; the exhibits 
in bread making, cake making and canning; the exhibits in 
sewing—all brought together in well ordered display—are of 
great educational and social value. They teach definite purpose, 
they encourage persistent effort, they demand careful thought, 
they require the ability to follow directions which call for close 
attention and concentration, they teach self-control and fair

play, they enlarge the ‘social horizon, they show the ‘value -of 
labor and the shallowness of luck.” 
The fair attracted wide attention and people from every 
section of the county, as well as visitors from the adjoining 
counties, were in attendance. It is the purpose of this Depart- 
ment to emphasize such exhibits and ‘to encourage other counties 
to extend the work already begun and more thoroughly organize 
other school fairs during the coming fall. These movements 
are especially to be commended, for they stimulate industrial 
activities on the part of students, not only at the school, but in 
their homes, and whatever does this is doing a most valuable 
educational service. 
EDUCATIONAL SITUATION IN TENNESSEE 
1860-1912. 
One of the chief functions of an educational report is to make 
comparisons between various periods which will show the prog~ 
ress that has been made. The State Superintendent of Public 
Instruction prepared a paper discussing Tennessee’s Educational 
Recovery for the meeting of the Southern Commercial Congress, 
and that paper is here given to show, as far as statistics can show, 
the difference between the educational situation in 1860 and the 
present time: 
7; “It is not possible to make any valuable comparisons between 
school conditions in Tennessee in 1860 and the present time, be- 
cause of the lack of statistical information for the former period. 
There was a legal public school system in the State, had been 
since 1823, but in all the period before 1860, the benefits of public 
education were not generally diffused, nor was the system com- 
parable in scope and efficiency with that which exists to-day, im- 
perfect as the present system is. The office of State Superin- 
tendent of Public Instruction was created in 1835, but abolished 
in 1844, from which time until 1867 the State Treasurer was ex- 
officio State Superintendent. Any school reports that were 
made during that period were only statistical tables setting forth 
the receipts from the State school taxes and their apportion- 
ment.
-P-A-G-E-74
— 69 — 
“In 1867 the Legislature radically revised the school law in 
an attempt to establish a more general State system of educa- 
tion. But the new law did not find favor, and the adverse senti- 
ment was so great that it was repealed in 1870, and the whole 
matter of public education relegated to the counties of the State. 
This condition prevailed until 1873, when the present'system of 
school administration was established. The legislative act of 
that year inaugurated a general scheme of school administra- 
tion, and provided for State and county taxes for school purposes; 
and since that time there has been steady -general progress in 
our public schools. 
“The first report under that law was prepared by Superin- 
tendent Fleming in 1874, and the statistics contained therein 
give us a basis for comparison with the present situation. 
' ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 
“In making this comparison we may first consider some gen- 
eral statistics bearing particularly on the elementary schools. 
The scholastic population in 1874 was about 435,000; in 1912, 
756,966. The number of pupils enrolled was 258,577, which is 
60 per cent of the total population; in our last report the enroll- 
iment amounted to 539,911, or 71 per cent of the total population. 
The average attendance in 1874 was 161,089, 37 per cent of the 
total population and 62 per cent of the total enrollment; to-day 
the average attendance aggregates 368,888, which is 49 per cent 
of the total population and 68 per cent of the total enrollment. 
In 1874 there were 5,551 teachers, now there are approximately 
11,000, a gain of 100 per cent. In the former period the schools, 
on the average, ran 77 days; in 1912, 127 days, an increase of 
70 per cent in 40 years. The average annual salary of teachers 
in 1874 was $127; in 1912, $304.84, a decided advance, but still 
far from offering much inducement to choose teaching as a life 
career. ~ 
“A study of the finances reveals some interesting facts. The 
receipts for school purposes in 1874 were, from the State, $265,- 
952; from counties, $522,453; from the cities, $112,636; from 
other sources, $97,418, making a total for the entire State of 
$998,459. Comparing this with the figures of 1912 we shall dis-
-P-A-G-E-75
—70— 
cover that the school receipts from the State amounted to $911,- 
849.81; from the counties, $4,605,061.55; from the cities and 
other sources, $949,710, which together with $1,160,351.50, 
balance from previous year, makes the school fund aggregate 
$6,677,262.86. While the scholastic population has increased 
only 80 per cent the money devoted to public education has 
increased 600 per cent. / 
“The most notable evidence of a stronger sentiment in favor 
of public education is derived from the study of local taxation 
for school purpose: In 1874 thirty-nine counties levied no poll 
tax for school purposes, the other fifty-four ranged from ten 
cents to $1.00. At the present time every county in the State, 
with one exception, levies a $1.00 poll tax. In 1874 thirty-four 
counties levied no property tax for educational purposes except 
the 10 cents on one one hundred dollars prescribed by the State; 
and the other forty-nine varied from 5 cents to 25 cents on the 
one hundred dollars; at the present time twenty-five counties 
levy a tax for elementary purposes of more than 25 cents, in 
addition to 15 cents required by the State; sixty a tax of 25 
cents, and the others a tax averaging 15 cents on one hundred 
dollars. In addition to this forty-four counties of the State now 
levy a special tax for high school purposes ranging from 2 to 15 
cents. In 1874 sixty-two counties levied no privilege tax for the 
benefit of education, while at the present time all the counties, 
\ except two, levy such a tax. NY 
HicH ScHoo.s. 
“Of all the public school agencies perhaps the high schools 
have made the most phenomenal progress during the last ten 
or fifteen years. This is true not only in Tennessee, but through- 
out the entire country. In 1874, in the system of instruction 
described in the superintendent’s report, there was comparatively 
little high school instruction given outside of a few of the larger 
cities. Years ago a law was passed in Tennessee creating second- 
ary schools whose courses of study involved some high school 
work, but they have been very ineffective. A high school law 
was passed in 1899, but it, too, failed to operate to great advan-~ 
tage. It was not until 1909 that life and impetus was given to
-P-A-G-E-76
—71— 
high school work. The general education bill of that year made 
generous provision for high schools; and under the stimulus of 
State aid and State certification of high school teachers therein 
provided, the high school sentiment has wonderfully increased 
and the work in general has been put upon a high plane. 
“Ten years ago the county high school work had scarcely 
begun. To-day forty-five counties levy special high school taxes 
and 111 county high schools have been established, thirty-seven 
of them carrying four years of genuine high school work. They 
employ 283 teachers, enroll 6,633 students; their buildings and 
equipment are valued at $864,311, and their annual expenditure 
amounts to $318,177.60. These county high schools are not 
mere duplicates of city schools, but agriculture and kindred sub- 
jects have found a place in their course of study. In many cases 
the teaching has passed the mere text-book stage, demonstra- 
tion farms having been provided. Work of this kind, however, 
has just begun, but there is every indication that it will go forward 
rapidly in the next few years. 
. “When we combine cities with counties in this comparison 
the progress is even more noticeable. Forty years ago practically 
no high school work was done in the State; to-day more than 
$3,000,000 are invested in high school plants, there are at least 
500 high school teachers, 10,000 pupils and the work is just 
getting under way. 
NorMAL ScHOootLs. 
“Going further with our comparisons, we have to note that 
in 1874 no provision was made for the training of teachers for 
the schools of the State. State Superintendent John Eaton and 
his successors had recognized the necessity for teacher training, 
and had given utterance to it in all their speeches and reports. 
Barnas Sears, general agent of the Peabody fund, coming to 
Tennessee to assist in the development of public school interests, 
had made a strong appeal for the establishment of a normal 
school; but it was not until 1876 that Peabody Normal College " 
opened its doors here in Nashville, and from that time until 1911 
furnished the only means for professional training of teachers 
in this State. The State gave generous support of the Peabody 
College, beginning in 1881 with an annual appropriation of
-P-A-G-E-77
—72— 
$10,000, which was. increased to $13,000 in 1883, to $18,000 in 
1891 and to $23,000 in 1895; and finally to secure its permanent 
location in the State a lump.sum of $250,000 was given. Of the 
; 10,000 students matriculating from time to time at that insti- 
tution, more than 4,000 of them were from Tennessee. 
“But years ago it was recognized that Peabody College be- 
longed not merely to Tennessee, but to the whole South, and that 
there.was need for this State to establish and equip its own schools. 
No legislative action was taken, however, until 1909; then. by 
the general education. bill provision was made for four normal 
schools. Various localities in the State competed for the estab- 
lishment of these institutions and handsome donations, aggre- 
gating more than three-quarters of a million dollars, were made 
by. the cities and counties in which they were finally placed. 
Two of these normal schools, one at. Murfreesboro and the other 
at Johnson City, have already been opened and the attendance 
for the first year is decidedly gratifying. The buildings of the 
West Tennessee Normal School are nearing completion and will 
be ready for occupancy this fall. The Agricultural and Indus- 
trial Normal-School for negroes will-also open shortly. The 
outlook for all these schools is encouraging. They start out with 
strong faculties, reasonable material equipment and State pro- 
vision for their maintenance. Their establishment and immedi- 
ate success give evidence of the strong demand for properly 
trained teachers and of the progress of the State public high school 
system. : v 
City ScHOOLs. 
“The city schools.of Tennessee are as good as those in cities 
of equal size in any part of the country. The large cities, Mem- 
phis,. Nashville, Chattanooga. and Knoxville, are well provided 
with excellent buildings, modern courses of study, trained teach- 
ers, and every faculty for first-class work. They are recognizing 
the new demands upon them growing out of the marvelous social, 
economical and industrial transformations of the last few years, 
and are responding in an effective way. In many of the smaller 
towns school facilities are also excellent. While not equipped 
on.so extensive a scale as those mentioned, yet they are reasonably 
good and rapidly improving.
-P-A-G-E-78
—73— 
“Definite statistics for studying the progress of the city schools 
are unavailable, the only figures we have for 1874 including only 
the cities of Nashville, Memphis, Chattanooga and Knoxville, 
while those for 1911 include many of the smaller towns of the 
State in addition. During the period under discussion the en- 
rollment in the city schools has increased from 12,163 to 77,618, 
the attendance from 7,517 to 58,376. In 1874 there were 180 
teachers; in 1911 1,900, and their annual salary has increased 
from $575 to $675. The revenues at the disposal of the city 
schools has grown from $204,824 to $2,205,752.31, the amount 
_ raised exclusively by the cities from $127,000 to $1,160,351.50. 
“Figures, of course, give only an imperfect idea of ‘the devel- 
opment, but these indicate in a general way the progress that 
has been made. There is no doubt that the people of the cities 
are willing to give all necessary financial and moral support to 
their schools. The great responsibility rests upon the school men 
to properly interpret the constantly growing demands upon the 
schools and to fashion them in such a way as to meet them more 
and more effectively. That this will be done in the cities of 
Tennessee there can be no doubt; and the indications are that 
in the next few years very rapid educational advance will be 
made in the city schools. As an evidence of the growing school 
activity it may be mentioned that Memphis has just completed 
a magnificent high school plant worth more than half a million 
dollars; that Nashville will this fall occupy its splendid building, 
which, when completed, will cost quite as much; that Knoxville 
and Chattanooga have comparatively new and modern plants; 
that Jackson has now in process of construction a high school 
‘building admirably adapted to the needs of that growing city. 
This does not make mention of a number of.grade school buildings 
that have been erected in these cities during the last few years. 
and of those constructed in the smaller towns and others now 
being planned. This building activity, I repeat, is the strongest 
evidence of increasing school interest, and argues well for the 
future of the city schools of Tennessee. 
PRIVATE SCHOOLS. 
“No ‘statement of educational progress in Tennessee would 
be complete without reference to the private schools. One
-P-A-G-E-79
— 74 — 
“hundred and ninety-eight are listed in the State Superintendent’s 
report for 1910; and of this number one hundred and eighty- 
three have been established since 1860. Statistics of defunct 
institutions which flourished at that time are not obtainable and 
comparisons are, therefore, impossible, but the largest of the 
private schools of the present time have been established within 
the last forty or fifty years, and their success is a factor in the 
progress of the period under discussion. They are a vital part 
of the educational system of this State, and they are rendering 
a patriotic service, especially those properly classified and main- 
taining respectable educational standards. Last year they re- 
ported about 35,000 students and 1,700 teachers. Some of 
them are well endowed and the total value of their property is 
approximately fifteen million dollars. 
CoNCcLUSION. 
“The facts and figures herein set forth indicate fair educa- 
tional progress. They show beyond question that the educa- 
tional opportunities which to-day are offered to the youth of 
the State are far superior to what they were a generation ago, 
and yet present conditions furnish no unfavorable criticism of 
those earlier days; but for the endeavors of the school pioneers 
the present situation could not have been attained. To them all 
honor is due—for the foundation they laid, for the success their 
efforts made possible. 
“Tt will do no good to speculate as to whether our educational 
progress has been ‘entirely satisfactory, but it can certainly do 
no harm to admit that the present status is far from gratifying. 
There is so much illiteracy in the State, so many of our boys and 
girls cut off from educational advantages, so short a term, such 
poor instruction, such inadequate material comfort for those 
who do attend that we find little to boast of or glory in. Indeed, 
the most hopeful sign educationally in Tennessee to-day is the 
realization that our public school system is not what it ought to 
be. Our ideals, our aims, thank Heaven! are far in advance of 
our present attainments. 
“And of all our school agencies that which is most backward 
is the rural elementary school. The shortness of term, the poor
-P-A-G-E-80
— 75 — 
salaries of teachers, the consequent inexperienced and untrained 
teaching force, the inadequate supervision, the unsanitary school 
conditions, the small school unit, the isolation, the antiquated 
course of study, the general inefficiency—all are counts in the 
indictment which can be truthfully drawn against the rural 
schools. Here is our vital educational problem in Tennessee. 
It is not peculiar to us, however; the whole South, indeed, the 
whole nation, is confronted with the same situation and the edu- 
cational leadership of the country is now concerned with its 
solution. Too long it has been neglected and other phases of 
our school work have been so completely in the thought of edu- 
cators that only recently have they awakened to the fact that 
the rural school is far behind; and with this rude awakening 
comes the realization of the tremendous importance of this in- 
stitution and the absolute necessity for resuscitating it—not 
for educational purposes alone, but also because of its.great sig- 
nificance in current moral and economic questions. 
“We do not mean to neglect other phases of educational work, 
but we do mean, if possible, to focus attention on this weakest 
spot of our school system and enlist the co-operation of évery 
patriotic citizen of the State in its betterment. This is not the 
time to set forth in detail a definite program for its improvement; 
indeed, further study of the situation is needed before there is 
sufficient knowledge to justify a complete and satisfactory pro- 
gram. But we do know that in all our planning we must seek 
to give a rural coloring to the whole rural school process to the 
end that the tendency among country boys and girls will be to 
remain on the farm. We know that we must have teachers 
especially prepared for rural school work, that our country high 
schools must be strengthened and demonstration farms provided 
in connection with them in order that vocational training may 
be given in the occupations peculiar to the South; that the whole 
course of study must be vitalized, made to grow out of, be more 
intimately related to and function for country life; that we must 
have a larger school unit for teaching and supervision purposes, 
which means consolidation and transportation. By doing these 
and other necessary things we shall so increase the efficiency of 
the rural schools that terms will be lengthened, better building 
and equipment provided and the schools will make more valuable
-P-A-G-E-81

contribution. to the economic, industrial and social life of the 
people as well as. to their intellectual life.” 
In conclusion, permit me to thank your Excellency for the 
cordial support which you have accorded to the department during 
these two years. We have endeavored to administer the affairs 
of this great office to the best interests of the school children as 
well as to the older citizens of Tennessee, and we would not have 
had even the success which this report indicates without the cor- 
dial and sympathetic co-operation which you have always given 
us. 
Respectfully submitted, 
J. W. BrisTEr, 
State Superintendent of Public Instruction.

SUMMARIES. 
The statistical tables which follow this statement are as 
compléte and accurate as could be made. The reports of the 
county superintendents have been tabulated with great care. 
and nothing has been left undone to secure from them every 
item of information bearing on the school situation. A careful 
study of these figures will show that reasonable progress along 
public educational lines is being made and that the public school 
system is being steadily developed. Of course, we have no ideal 
condition—we do not yet even approximate it—but there are 
many evidences of growth and progress which are encouraging. 
The scholastic population is approximately the same as in 
the previous report, being less than 1,000 in excess of what it 
was last year; but the enrollment and attendance are both con- 
siderably in advance of all previous records, there being more 
than 10,000 increase in enrollment and 8,000 in attendance. 
The condition indicated by these figures, however, are still far 
from satisfactory. Only 71 per cent of the scholastic population 
is enrolled in the public schools, and only 49 per. cent in actual 
attendance. It is true that the scholastic population includes 
many persons who cannot be expected in school—the legal school 
age limits being six to twenty-one—but after all allowances are 
made it is dissappointing to the school authorities to realize that 
thousands of young people who ought to be in school are for some 
reason or other being deprived of educational advantages. This 
unsatisfactory condition exists not only in the country districts, 
' but even in the cities, there being less than 58 per cent of the 
city school population enrolled and 43 per cent in attendance. 
It would seem from this recital that a compulsory school at- 
tendance law is needed. It is true that there are local attendance 
laws in about 33 counties of the State, but owing to the multi- 
plicity of excuses accepted and their local operation, they are 
indifferently enforced. In some counties where serious attempts 
have been made at enforcement the results are gratifying. Few 
states are without some form of school attendance laws, and con- 
ditions are such in Tennessee as to demand, we believe, the pas- 
sage of such a law by the coming General Assembly.
-P-A-G-E-85
— 80 — 
Tables VII and VIII appear in these statistics for the first. 
time this year. A movement. for consolidation and transporta- 
tion is making headway. all over the country and it has been 
deemed wise to collect annually statistics concerning it in this 
State. It will be noted here that there are a number of schools 
_with three teachers, and more, already in Tennessee. It will 
be seen, however, that the majority of them are in counties hav- 
ing large cities. These tables show that 148 small schools have 
been abandoned during the year, that there are now 26 public 
school wagons in use in five counties and that 667 pupils are 
being hauled daily to school. This is small in comparison with 
the large school attendance, but it indicates that a beginning 
is being made towards a solution of a great problem. 
Table XI gives a very encouraging record, showing that the 
total value of school property for year ending June 30, 1912, is 
more than two million dollars in excess of the value in 1911. 
Table XII is as correct as can be made under the circum- 
stances, and it is believed that it is much more dependable than 
the same table of the preceding year. No increase in the length 
of the school term is shown, but teachers’ salaries have advanced 
considerably both in county elementary schools and in city 
schools, and the average monthly salary paid to teachers is about 
$6 in excess of what it was the previous year. The average yearly 
salary, especially for elementary teachers, is still discouragingly 
small, but the fact that it is increasing gives hope for a satisfac- 
tory minimum at no distant date. 
Tables XVIII and XIX which present 4 financial statement 
of the public school situation in Tennessee show a gratifying im- 
provement over all previous years. These tables have been 
worked out very carefully and are as accurate as the reports 
from the various counties will permit. It will be noted here 
that the receipts from the State, county and cities are all.con- 
siderably in excess of last year, the total for the year ending June 
30, 1912, being $695,812 more than that for 1911, It should 
be stated right here that there are many items of school revenue 
which are not accounted for in this report. There is no law com- 
pelling cities or incorporated towns to make reports-to county 
superintendents or to the State Superintendent, and in conse- 
quence any funds which are being raised in many towns and cities
-P-A-G-E-86
— 81 — 
by special approrpiation or otherwise do not appear in this 
record. The larger cities furnish reports because of their pride 
in the system, but it appears impossible to secure any data from 
many small towns in the State which have independent Boards 
of Education. There ought to be some revision of the law which 
would compel every school unit to make a report, not only of 
revenues received from State and county officials, but also of 
that raised by special local taxation or otherwise. 
I have added to the comparative summaries a page of ‘sta- 
tistics setting forth in brief the facts for the year ending June 
30, 1912, and I have made certain calculations based on these 
figures as to school expenditures which, it is hoped, will be of 
general interest.

NASHVILLE, TENN., November 20, 1912. 
To the State Board of Education: 
I beg to submit herewith the report of the State High School 
Inspector for the year ending June 30, 1912. I was unable to 
get a report from Sequatchie County or a complete report from 
two or three other counties, hence all totals, including the sum- 
mary, are somewhat less than they would be if every county 
report had been complete. 
Most respectfully, 
P. L. HaRNED, 
State High School Inspector.

expenditures from $213,086 to $318,177, 50 per cent; number 
of books in high school libraries from 9,807 to 14,384, 46 per 
cent; the average cost of tuition has been reduced from $4.00 
a month to $3.96. 
These gains were made during the period of least opportunity 
for the improvement of public institutions—the period preceding 
the election of members of the quarterly court and county su- 
perintendents. With these elections over, a number of counties 
will be added to the list of high school counties in the near future. 
DistRIiBUTION oF County Hicu ScHOOL. 
Of the thirty-four counties in East Tennessee, twenty-three, 
or 67 per cent, have county high schools. Of the forty-one 
counties in Middle Tennessee, only thirteen, or 32 per cent, have 
high schools; and of the twenty-one counties in West Tennessee, 
only nine, or 43 per cent, have county high schools. 
Of all the high school counties in the State, forty-five, East 
Tennessee has 50 per cent, Middle Tennessee has 30 per cent, 
and West Tennessee has 20 per cent. 
Of the one hundred and eleven high schools in the State, 
East Tennessee has fifty-four, or 48 per cent; Middle Tennessee
-P-A-G-E-223
— 216 — 
has twenty-seven, or twenty-five per cent; and West Tennessee 
has thirty, or 27 per cent. ' 
In the different sections there are different conditions, that, to 
some extent, explain these differences. However, the conditions 
are now changing and there will be considerable development 
in both Middle and West Tennessee. 
UNDESIRABLE TENDENCY. 
There is but one undesirable tendency in the development 
of our high school system. Some counties are trying to run 
too many separate schools, more than the funds provided can 
run successfully. Many counties, under the maximum tax 
levy allowed by law, are able to run but one high school. No 
county should undertake to run more than the funds provided 
by the State and county can run well. In eleven counties there 
is needed consolidation, even if pupils from some communities 
should have to be transported, in order that these counties may 
have a higher standard of work. Each county should have one 
first-class school doing all the work, and then, as many second 
or third class schools as the funds will permit. 
THE SECONDARY SCHOOL. 
The so-called secondary schools were established at the ex- 
se of the elementary schools of the State, and the good re- 
3 of these schools have never been commensurate with the 
cost in money and time taken from the primary grades. There 
are nine subjects to be taught in the primary, or elementary 
schools. The secondary school added eight more subjects to 
the course without providing one cent additional to take care 
of these extra subjects. In the secondary schools of the State 
the number énrolled in the secondary subjects is only one and 
one-half per cent of the total enrollment in the rural districts, 
but in the secondary schools at least one-half of the time of the 
teacher or teachers is required to teach the eight subjects of 
the secondary course; hence, it is easy to see that the few in 
the secondary department are taught at a great sacrifice of time 
and money to the children in the lower grades, numbering 
440,921.
-P-A-G-E-224
— 217 ~ 
Besides, the secondary school does not articulate with college, neither does it give any definite vocational advantages. The high school does articulate with the elementary school and with college, and it does give definite vocational training that counts for something to those pupils who cannot go to college, and it is not run at the expense of the. children in the lower grades, for no county can establish a high school without providing funds to take care of it. 
HicH Scuoo. TRacuers. 
A large number of the teachers employed in the high schools are college graduates. All teachers are licensed under rigid regulations of the State Board of Education. Those who do not meet the requirements as college graduates must take an exami- nation under the direction of the State Board of Education in order to receive either a county or a State certificate to teach. The interest of the people as well as the interest of the qualified teachers is thus well protected. During the past two years, since these requirements were made, there has not come to this department a single complaint that any teacher, regularly licensed, is incompe- tent. I do not believe that any State has a better class of high school teachers, and, where the local conditions will permit, I do not believe that better work is done. 
Courses or Strupy. 
During the three years of their use the various courses of study: have worked well, but present conditions and the present state of high school construction make it necessary to revise the vocational courses. The course in Agriculture will be care- fully revised. A course in home economics will be worked out. The commercial course will be. modified somewhat. A course for elementary teachers will be prepared and one planned for manual training. This revision will be made in the early spring—in time for use next September. 
Hicu Scuoor Tax Levy. 
In the-early history of the ‘free’ schools of the State, many counties would not levy a school tax. The State, realizing that it could not become the great State possible to be without edu-
-P-A-G-E-225
— 218 — 
cating all of. its citizenship, had to enact a law requiring each 
county to.levy not less than 15 cents on the hundred dollars of 
taxable property for “‘free’’ schools. The wisdom of that act 
has never been questioned, and no progressive citizen would 
care to object to the plan of public education. Another act that 
would do nearly as much good is one that would fix the minimum 
high school rate to be levied by each county and require each 
county to establish high schools for its children. Of course, the 
minimum should be fixed according to the taxable property of 
the county—not the same for every county, for a rate for Han- 
cock County would produce entirely too much for Shelby. 
Then, too, it seems unfair for the State to fix the maximum. tax 
a county may levy, but should allow any county the privilege 
of levying whatever rate the people of that county want and thus 
give more nearly equal opportunity to all the children of the 
State. 
HicH ScHoor SuRePLus. 
Under the present law the surplus of the high school fund at 
the end of the scholastic year is carried to the common school 
fund and is distributed among the counties according to the 
scholastic population. This surplus is very much needed to aid 
the departments of agriculture and home economics in the high 
schools and should be used in this way until there are enough 
counties to establish high schools to take all the fund as now dis- 
tributed. If the law were modified so that this surplus could be 
thus used it would serve a good purpose. One year’s use would 
stimulate the work in these departments so much that the coun- 
ties would be willing to take proper care of them in the future. 
ASSISTANT INSPECTOR. 
‘I beg to state further that more assistance in this depart- 
ment could be used profitably to the State. The work has in- 
creased so much that one person can not respond to all the calls 
on his time and make the thorough inspection of the high schools 
that is needed. I am sure it would be economy to the State and 
the money expended in this way would pay good returns. In 
the time of organization and construction of the system the 
work is necessarily heavy, hence the suggestion.

CONCLUSION. 
In conclusion I desire to express my gratitude to the State 
Superintendent for his excellent service, the members of the 
State Board and high school boards, the county superintendents, 
the high school teachers, and the public-spirited citizens who have 
co-operated so faithfully in making our high school system what 
it is. 
Most respéctfully, 
P. L. Harnep, High School Inspector.

Hicu ScHoot TEACHERS’ READING CouRSE. 
1911-1912. 
In the revised regulations governing the issuance of high 
school certificates, professiorial credits are required of all ap- 
plicants to teach in county high schools. To meet this require- 
ment the State Superintendent of Public Instruction and the 
State High School Inspector, acting under the authority of the 
State Board of Education, have selected two books as a reading 
circle course for all.teachers employed in the county high schools 
of the State. 
While it is taken for granted that all high school teachers 
are readers, it is necessary to have a uniform course in order to 
unify their work and direct their thought along specific lines. 
The books selected for this scholastic year will direct and unify 
thought, bring all into closer relationship and create a commu- 
nity spirit which can result in nothing but good to the teachers 
and their schodls,
-P-A-G-E-263
— 256 — 
The books selected are: 
1. Davenport’s ‘Education for Efficiency,”’ published by D. 
C. Heath and Company, Atlanta. Price, prepaid in lots of one 
to ten, 80 cents. 
2. Monroe’s “‘A Brief Course in the History of Education,’’ 
published by the Macmillan Company, Atlanta. Price, prepaid 
individual orders, $1.15. Quantity lot orders, express charges 
to be paid by purchaser, $1.00. 
High school teachers are requested to secure - these books at 
once and enter upon a thorough study of them. The professional 
examination required in 1912 will be based on them.

Frencu. 
On est habitué a considérer le soldat comme un étre inférieur 
recruté, dans les bas-fonds de la société, n’ayant droit 4 quelque 
consideration que parce qu’il soit tenir un fusil et va insouciment 
se faire tuer pour un shilling par jour. Cette appréciation est 
évidemment fausse en ce qui concerne la France; 1a, comme en 
Autriche et en. Allemagne, l’armée est, en vérité, la nation elle- 
méme, la fleur de la nation, forte, honnéte, digne de tout respect. 
Dans les conditions actuelles, le service militaire y est une véritable 
école d’honneur, de discipline, de qualités viriles. Le paysan et 
Youvrier quittent l'un sa chaumiére, l’autre son loge étroit de la 
ville. WVoyez-les s’avancer, d’un pas mal réglé, l’esprit peut-étre 
aussi parfois mal discipliné, quelque pur égoiste, rempli d’idées 
incongrues. Peu d’années aprés ils reviennent dans leurs foyers. 
Sont-ce les mémes hommes? Comme ils marchent le front haut, 
@un pas élastique et vigoureux ! : 
On ne saurait dire qu’un seul homme, quelque grand qu'il soit, 
représente un pays. Mais quand, a certaines époques, on voit dans 
uné nation apparaitre en méme temps plusieurs hommes éminents 
4 différents titres, on est fondé a croire qu’en eux se manifeste le

My Dear Sir: ‘The State high school fund for the year ending 
June 30, 1912, has been distributed and the Comptroller will send 
your trustee a warrant for $..0.000 eee within a few days.
-P-A-G-E-295

Heretofore there has been a distribution of the high school 
fund in July and another in January. This year there is enough 
of the fund to give those counties that will receive one-third of 
the amount they produce their year’s apportionment at one 
time. The counties that are entitled to the maximum are given 
one-fiftieth of the July apportionment and in January they will 
receive one-fiftieth of the January apportionment. These 
counties receive in this distribution $1,106.06. The other 
counties having received their year’s apportionment will not be 
entitled to any further distribution in January, 1912. Greene, 
Hancock and Hardin counties, on account of not having filed 
reports at the proper time did not receive all due them for the 
year ending June 30, 1911. In this distribution the respective 
amounts due them for last year are included. Haywood County 
did not levy the tax until after the distribution was made. Ht, 
too, is given what was due it last year. 
Kindly report to this office if the warrant does not reach 
your trustee within the next ten days. 
Sincerely yours, 
P. L. Harnep, 
High School Inspector. 
NASHVILLE, TENN., August 3, 1911. 
My Dear Sir: I beg to call your attention to the fact that 
the last examination for high school teachers for this year will be 
conducted August 22-24. At this time there will be an oppor- 
tunity offered in each county where there is a county high school 
for applicants to take the examination for county certificates. 
At the same time, those desiring State certificates will have an 
opportunity to take the examination at Knoxville, Nashville and 
Jackson. 
Please have your board decide upon their teachers for next 
year, if this has not already been done, and see ‘that those who 
‘have not a certificate attend one of these examinations, either 
that of your county or a State examination, and qualify, for a 
special examination later is very uncertain. 
Sincerely yours, 
P. L. HARNED, 
High School Inspector.

NASHVILLE, TENN., August 9, 1911. 
  My ‘DEAR Str: The State Board of Education of Tennessee 
authorizes the issuance ‘of high school certificates to teachers 
who hold a bachelor’s diploma under the following regulations: 
“State certificates good for one year and renewable annually 
for continuous and efficient service will be issued to persohs who 
are to teach in this State and who hold a bachelor’s diploma from 
the University of Tennessee or an equivalent institution requiring 
at the time of the applicant’s admission to the institution at least 
fourteen Carnegie units for entrance; provided, said applicant 
shall have taken at least two courses of not less than three months 
each of professional work; provided, further, that applicants 
holding such diplomas and not having taken professional training 
may qualify for the above certificate by standing State examina- 
tion on professional subjects. A diploma must be approved by 
the State Superintendent and High School Inspector and regis- 
tered before a certificate is issued.” 
Maaco cele eee cece eeee cece renee et eeceeeeeeeeeoe has applied to us for 
a high school certificate under the above regulations, and before 
the same can be issued it will be necessary for us to have a state- 
ment from you. We are therefore enclosing a blank form with 
the request that you fill it out with as much detail as possible. 
Thanking you for this information, I beg to remain, 
Sincerely yours, 
P. L. HARNED, 
High School Inspector. 
NASHVILLE, TENN., September 15, 1911. 
ra 
..County. 
    The State Board of Education has authorized a special high 
school examination of teachers not yet licensed on September 29 
and 30. Be certain to have all your teachers not licensed to 
take it, for no other will be given.
-P-A-G-E-297
— 288 — 
I suggest, if you find it absolutely necessary, that enough 
special one-year certificates be ordered to fill your actual vacan- 
cies, taking those who make the highest marks, provided enough 
do not make the required average. 
Questions will be sent from this office. The examination 
will be conducted by yourself and committee, the papers and a 
signed report of each applicant’s grades will be sent this office for 
filing, the certificate forms will be sent for the signature of your- 
self and committee and to be delivered to the teacher. 
Each superintendent needing questions for this examination 
is requested to order at once the subjects needed so that no time 
or expense will be wasted making questions not needed and so 
that I can arrange the order of the subjects, if possible, so that 
the least number will be required to take the examination on 
Friday, losing a day from school. If I had the ndmes and sub- 
jects each is to take I could arrange the order so that it would be 
necessary for only a few, if any, counties to use Friday. 
Waiting an carly reply, Tam, 
Sincerely yours, 
P. L. HaRNep, 
High School Inspector. 
NASHVILLE, TENN., December 16, 1911. 
To the County Superintendent, . 
My Dear Sir: Please let me know (1) when your county will 
levy taxes for 1912; (2) if you are making any effort to secure a 
high school levy at that time; (3) the names and addresses of 
your magistrates, and (4) whether this office can assist you in 
your efforts. We will be able to send out a few men in the interest 
of high schools on the first Monday in January, April and July. 
No county system of education is completed without the high 
school and I would like very much for every county to use its 
portion of the State fund and in turn give its girls and boys an 
opportunity for a high school education. 
Hoping to hear from you at once, I beg to remain, 
Sincerely yours, 
P. L. HARNED, 
High School Inspector.

soon as your committee can grade the papers send the grade 
sheet and examination papers here for filing and certificates will 
be sent you to be signed and given the applicants who pass. 
The next examination will be conducted in September. I 
hope that you will see that all your teachers are licensed this 
year before school opens. I want to thank you earnestly for 
your hearty co-operation in the administration of the State system 
of high schools. With this same spirit continuing it is only a 
question of a little while when the high schools of Tennessee will 
reach as high a standard in service and efficiency as those of any 
other State. 
No county certificate will be renewed except on request of 
the County Superintendent.

that it is necessary to give further explanation of credits entitling 
pupils to graduate in county high schools. The minimum for 
-graduation should not be less than eight units for high schools of 
the third-class, twelve units for high schools of the second-class, 
and fourteen ‘units for high schools of the first-class, a unit being

appropriations to secure the location of the school: 
Rhea County and Dayton. 
Bradley County and Cleveland. 
McMinn County and Athens. 
Monroe County and Sweetwater. 
Washington County and Johnson City. 
After a full and impartial consideration of the advantages 
and disadvantages of each of these locations, and after an inves- 
tigation of the appropriations and other valuable considerations, 
the State Board of Education accepted the donation offered in 
Washington County and located the school at Johnson City. 
These donations were as follows: 
Washington County appropriated $75,000 in bonds; Johnson 
City gave $75,000 in bonds, free lights, and free water, and pro- 
vides granolithic walks to the school grounds. 
Hon. George L. Carter donated a valuable site of 120 acres, 
worth perhaps $60,000. 
The Johnson City Traction Company offered to extend their 
lines to or by the site of the school. 
The buildings, which consist of the main or academic build- 
ing, the women’s dormitory, the kitchen and dining room, the 
power house, and the president's residence, were not fully com- 
pleted before November 1, 1911, but the school was opened on

MAINTENANCE. 
The maintenance of the State Normal School is provided for 
in the General Education Bill, which sets aside 25 per cent of 
the gross revenues of the State as an education fund. Of this
-P-A-G-E-312
— 301 — 
share the four State Normal schools receive 13 per cent, or 334 
per cent of the gross revenues of the State. Each of the white 
Normal Schools receives two-seventh of this fund, and the col- 
ored Normal School one-seventh. 
From a report submitted to me by Miss Izzie Hayes, the 
general bookkeeper of the State Normal School funds, the fol- 
lowing statement of the funds of the East Tennessee State 
Normal School has been prepared. This report includes in its 
receipts $75,000 given by Johnson City, the $75,000 given by 
Washington County, and in its expenditures all the disburse- 
ments made for buildings, equipment, and improvement of 
grounds.

As this fund is in the hands of the State Treasurer and is 
paid out only on approved statements of the State Superinten- 
dent of Schools, the itemized reports of the disbursements can 
be made by the general bookkeeper of the State Normal School 
fund. 
The above report shows that the total receipts from the State 
for the year 1912 include only the January distribution of $9,- 
246.30, and the July distribution of $26,689.28,. or a total of 
$35,935.58.

In addition to the maintenance fund provided by. the State 
there is a local fund including registration fees, the amount paid 
by the City Board of Education of Johnson City for the tuition 
of high school pupils, the tuition received for pupils in the Ob- 
servation and Practice School, and the amount collected for 
room rents. All these funds are collected by the Bursar of the 
State Normal School, and are paid out only on the approval of 
the President. A copy of a report of the Bursar for the school 
year, ending July 31, 1912, is herewith submitted and made a

During the Summer Term a meeting of the County Superin- 
tendents of East Tennessee was held, June 24-27. More than 
half of the counties were represented in this meeting, and in 
addition to visiting the classes of the school and inspecting the 
work being done, the superintendents and members of the 
faculty held meetings each afternoon and discussed questions 
of special interest in connection with the supervision of the public
-P-A-G-E-316

schools. It is hoped that this feature of the Summer School 
shall be made a permanent one and that some provision may be 
made that will more easily assure the attendance of all the su- 
perintendents in East Tennessee. At the close of the meeting 
the following report was made by a committee appointed by the 
superintendents to inspect the work of the Normal School: 
“We, the committee appointed to inspect the buildings, equip- 
ment and the work of the East Tennessee State Normal School, 
beg to report as follows: : 
“That we have carefully gone through the buildings, visit- 
ing the various departments and inspecting the work of the class 
rooms, and found in each department a splendid type of work 
being done. . 
“That while we cannot mention separately each and every. 
phase of the work, we are especially pleased with the courses 
that are being given in the Manual Training Department. We 
feet that this department is meeting a long-felt need. 
“We are very much gratified with the up-to-date equipment 
and the quality of the work found in the Department of Domestic 
Science, and we commend the interest that is being taken by 
the girls in this department. We believe that every young 
woman attending the school should be required to take at least 
a year’s work in this department. 
“In the Department of Agriculture, we found in the class- 
room modern apparatus for the study of scientific agriculture, 
and in the outdoor laboratory, or experiment garden, splendid 
practice in the practical application of the principles developed 
in this department. The boys doing the field work are to be 
commended for the good showing made on the various plats. : 
“We are pleased’ to note that a large number of teachers 
are taking work in the Training School and we suggest that 
all pupils in the Normal Course be required to take at least a 
limited course in this department. 
“We have thoroughly inspected the women's dormitory and 
find it well arranged, splendidly and conveniently equipped. 
It is conducted under strict regulations, and is kept in a neat 
and sanitary condition. 
“We heartily commend President Gilbreath and the able 
faculty for the faultless administration of the school, and, while
-P-A-G-E-317
— 306 — 
we find no criticism on the character of the work, we are sure 
that the school, in order to meet the demands, must have a 
young men’s dormitory and a building for science and agri- 
culture. 
“We are satisfied that the school, although in its infancy, 
is serving well its purpose—that of training teachers. 
“Respectfully submitted, 
R. P. DriskKILi, Cocke County,

East Tennessee by several members of the faculty. 
Farmers’ INSTITUTES. 
A Farmers’ Institute was held at the State Normal School 
on February 27, 28 and 29, 1912, and was largely attended. It is 
planned to hold these institutes regularly throughout the year, 
as it is believed that they will be not only of service to,the agri- 
cultural interests of East Tennessee, but very helpful and in- 
spiring to the students of the Normal School. The following 
program was given:

East TENNESSEE EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
The seventh session of the East Tennessee Educational 
Association was held in ‘the State Normal School, April 4, 5 and 
6. Dean C, Hodge Mathes was Secretary for the meeting, and 
it is due to his untiring efforts that the Association was more 
largely attended and more successful in every way than any 
former meetings of the Association. The visitors and delegates 
in attendance numbered more than 500, including-nearly all 
the county and city superintendents from East Tennessee, to- 
gether with hundreds of teachers and school officials. The lead- 
ing features of the meeting were the address of the President of 
the Association, Superintendent John R. Lowry, of Park City, 
and the addresses of President Jacob Gould Schurman, of Kansas 
City; State Superintendent John W. Brister, and Vice-President 
William S. Bovard, of the University of Chattanooga. 
On the second day of the meeting the school gave a luncheon 
to the five hundred delegates present.. This meeting, by bring- 
ing to the Normal School the superintendents, members of boards 
of education, and the leading teachers of East Tennessee, did 
much to acquaint the school officials with the purposes of the 
Normal School and with its preparation for the work it has to 
do. Before the close of the Association the following resolutions 
were unanimously adopted: 
“The East Tennessee Educational Association expresses 
its gratification and pride at the remarkable success won by the 
East Tennessee State Normal School in its first year’s work. 
Already its attendance is in excess of two hundred in the normal 
courses, and with its superior faculty of experienced and en- 
thusiastic teachers, its modern courses of study, academic and 
professional, and its splendid equipment, its influence is already 
being felt for good in the educational circles of the State. We 
heartily approve its present policy and management and com- 
mend the school to the favorable consideration of the State of- 
ficials, teachers, and prospective teachers of East Tennessee. 
“We ask that our senators and representatives in the next 
General Assembly of the State shall provide means for the en- 
largement of its facilities. Additional dormitory room should 
- be provided for both men and women, and an agricultural and 
science building should be erected and equipped. -
-P-A-G-E-320

“We respectfully urge that the most liberal policy be adopted 
in looking to its enlargement and work.

CouRsE oF STUDY. : 
The course of study for the Normal School includes all the 
branches taught in the public elementary, secondary, and high 
schools of the State, also the subjects usually included in the 
freshman and sophomore years of standard colleges. . In addition 
to the academic branches the following required courses are 
given: School Management, School Law, Elementary Psycholo- 
gy, Elementary History of Education, Secondary Education, 
School Administration, School Sanitation, Educational Psy- 
chology, General Psychology, Child Study, Advanced History of 
Education, Educational Classics and the Reading Circle Courses. 
Drawing and vocal music are required of all candidates for cer- 
tificates, and special attention is given to physiology; hygiene and 
physical training. 
All students are required to take one course in General 
Method of Teaching, and at least one course in Special Methods. 
In connection with these courses the students are required to 
do observation work in the Observation and Practice School, and, 
under the direction of the principal of the school and the critic 
teacher, to develop lesson plans and do practice teaching. In 
this way they are enabled to observe the scientific methods of 
management and teaching, and to put into practice and acquire 
skill in the principles and methods known to be sound through 
the experience and research of leading educators. 
- EQUIPMENT. . 
At the beginning of the year no equipment had been pur- 
chased for any of the departments of the school, but during the 
year equipment and apparatus were purchased for the work in 
agriculture, manual training, domestic science, physics, chemis- 
try, biology, physiology and botany.
-P-A-G-E-321

AGRICULTURE. 
Special attention has been given throughout the year to the 
development of the Department of Agriculture. In addition to 
the school garden and demonstration. tract, containing about 
three acres, this department gave some attention to the care of 
the campus during the year and cultivated about four acres of 
ground. The principal equipment consists of two mules, one 
two-horse wagon, one turning plow, one sub-soil plow, six wheel 
plows, one cultivator, one disc harrow, one drag harrow, and a 
supply of garden tools, such as rakes, hoes, spades, etc. 
Under the supervision of the Manual Training Department 
one garden-tool house has been erected. A modern and complete 
combination stock and dairy barn has been built at a cost of 
about $1,500. Enough hay and corn has been produced to care 
' for the stock. One brood sow and eight pigs have been pur- 
chased and are being kept largely on the slops from the kitchen. 
The interest taken in this department by the students of the 
school has been remarkably good, and classes have been organ- 
ized in all the courses offered. 
DoMESTIC SCIENCE. 
In this department two coal stoves have been installed, one 
by purchase and one by donation to the school. In addition 
to this a gasoline stove has been donated. The equipment con- 
sists of a full supply of cooking utensils and tableware, a refrig- 
erator, cooking tables, cupboards, cabinets, and a lunch counter. 
The lunch counter was operated very successfully during the 
Spring and Summer Terms without expense to the school. It 
was patronized daily by from fifty to seventy-five students. 
Much of the food prepared by the regular cooking classes is 
utilized as a supply for the lunch department. Classes were 
organized in all the courses, with such large attendance that it 
will be necessary to employ an additional instructor for the next 
year. 
The Sewing Department has been equipped with sewing 
machines, cutting tables, models, cheval mirror, and cabinet. 
All of the’ courses offered in this department have been taken 
by large classes. .

MANUAL TRAINING. 
The work in this department has been very successfully 
inaugurated. A report from the head of the department shows’ 
that there are now on hand tools purchased for the department 
amounting to $417.22, and that in addition the department made 
for its own use equipment having a total value of $589.25, as

SCIENCE, 
Reasonably well-equipped laboratories in physics, chemistry, 
biology and physiology have been provided, and additional 
equipment will be added during the coming year, and from time 
to time as it may be needed. In the chemistry laboratory two 
rows of modern double desks have been built, and a sufficient 
amount of apparatus and chemical supplies have been installed 
for the large classes that have been organized. The chemistry 
lecture room has been supplied with cabinets and teacher’s 
demonstration desk, and necessary apparatus and chemicals. 
‘This lecture room is seated with opera chairs placed on an ele- 
vated and inclined floor. 
The physics rooms have been equipped with a teacher’s 
demonstration desk and fairly well supplied with equipment and 
apparatus. The supply room and the lecture rooms have been 
furnished with well-constructed cabinets built under the super- 
vision of the Manual Training Department. 
GYMNASIUM. 
One room in the basement, 55x55 feet, has been set aside 
for use as a gymnasium. But little equipment has been placed 
in it, but it is planned to add largely to the equipment for the 
coming year. Some of the apparatus and lockers were construct- 
ed by the students in the Manual Training Department. This 
room is used under the direction of the instructor in physical 
training for the exercises by the children in the Observation and 
Practice School, and is used by the young men and young women . 
of the Normal School on alternate days for regular gymnasium 
work, 
In the rear and to the north of the main building, it is planned 
to construct by the beginning of the next term a number of tennis 
courts, probably four to six, open air basket-ball grounds, and 
an athletic field for baseball, football and track work.
-P-A-G-E-325
— 314— 
LIBRARY. 
In the absence of a library building one of the largest and 
best lighted class rooms is used for a library and reading room. 
Books amounting in value to about $650 have been purchased. 
by the Library Committee after studying the lists submitted by 
the members of the faculty, the lists representing only a small 
number of those most urgently needed in the work of the school. 
A number of the’best magazines and periodicals and the East 
Tennessee daily papers come to the reading room. It has been 
planned to add materially to the library during the coming year, 
and to subscribe for.additional journals for the reading room. 
A very valuable museum, including minerals and stones 
of all kinds and gathered from all parts of the United States 
and the world, together with a fine collection of Indian curios 
and relics and a number of old and valuable pamphlets and papers, 
have been donated to the school by Rev. Franklin P. Baxter. 
Under the supervision of the Manual Training Department a 
substantial cabinet covering one end of the library was installed 
for the reception and preservation of this valuable collection: 
In addition to the gift already named, Mr. Baxter has donated 
to the Normal School a very complete collection of paper cur- 
rency of the United States, dating from the Colonial period and 
including many rare specimens of fractional, State and county 
currency. 
DRIVEWAYS AND GROUNDS. 
Under the supervision of Professor Charles A. Keffer, of 
the University of Tennessee, who was engaged by the State 
Board of Education as landscape gardener, and under the di- 
rection of the resident engineer, one mile of macadamized road- — 
way, varying from fourteen to twenty feet in width, and from 
seven to nine inches in thickness, has been bulit. A good por- 
tion of this roadway was guttered on each side with concrete 
gutters. These driveways, which are well-built, were laid out 
to, the best advantage and reach all of the buildings. 
Professor Keffer also made the selection and superintended 
the planting of more than 3,500 trees and shrubs, which he 
grouped in such a way as best to add to the beautiful landscape
-P-A-G-E-326

effect. With the care and cultivation that the plants and shrubs 
have been given nearly all are living, and in the course of a 
few years will contribute much to the natural beauty of the 
‘campus. The.entire campus of some fifteen or twenty acres 
was sowed in peas and properly fertilized. Later the pea crop’ 
was turned under, and the ground disked and smoothed. Later 
rye and vetch will be sowed as a winter cover crop. Next 
spring it is planned, after this crop has been removed, to sow the 
entire campus in blue grass. Already some of the smaller areas 
near the buildings have been sowed in blue grass with very suc- 
cessful results. It is hoped to have within two. or three years 
a beautiful, well-sodded campus, with excellent driveways and 
unexcelled variety of trees, shrubs and flowers. 
PUBLICATIONS. 
The school publishes regularly in June, September, Decem- 
ber and March, of each year, a bulletin giving information as to 
the work, progress and activities of the Normal School. Of 
Volume I, Bulletin No. 1, made announcements of the opening 
of the school, the terms of admission, and the courses of study. 
Bulletin No. 2 supplemented this with additional information as 
to courses of study and the general requirements. No. 3. gave 
a complete report of the dedication of the buildings, including 
the able addresses of Hon. J. W. Brister, State Superintendent 
of Schools, and Hon. S. H. Thompson, member of the State 
Board of Education. No. 4 contained complete announcements 
of the Summer Term. Volume II, No. 1 of the Bulletin, was the 
catalog number, and in addition gave information relative to 
courses of study, and other miscellaneous information useful 
to prospective students. / 
The student body, under faculty direction, elected a com- 
plete editorial staff and published for the last three months of 
the school year a very creditable school journal, “The East 
Tennessee Teacher.” This journal will be continued next year 
and will be published each month throughout the year. Both 
the Bulletin and “The Teacher’’ have been admitted to the mails 
as second-class matter.

STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS. 
Early in the year two literary societies were organized, 
the Pestalozzian by the young men of the school, and the Sap- 
phonian by the young women. These societies held regular 
weekly meetings and were active organizations throughout the 
school year. A very strong Young Women’s Christian Associa- 
tion was organized with a membership of more than one hun- 
dred. This Association sent two delegates to the annual Y. 
W. C. A. conference at Asheville, N. C. 
In addition to these school organizations, nearly all the coun- 
ties represented had their county clubs, which were influential 
in the life of the school. The Glee Club, under the direction of 
Miss Rankin, and the School Chorus, directed by Professor D. 
R. Haworth, were organized during the year and each had a 
large membership. 
PosITIONS FOR GRADUATES. ~ 
The Normal School, through its Committee on Appoint- 
ments and Employment, was able to be of service to both boards 
of education and the graduates of the school in supplying posi- 
tions with suitable and efficient teachers. The boards of Edu- 
cation throughout East Tennessee were invited to notify the 
Normal School of any vacancies they desired filled, and this re- 
quest met with hearty co-operation. All who received the cer- 
tificates of the school last year found desirable positions, and are 
now contributing to the improvement of the public schools in 
the counties where they are teaching. 
LECTURES AND ADDRESSES. 
A number of excellent lectures and addresses were given 
during the year. Among those heard were Hon. P. P. Claxton; 
President Jacob Gould Schurman, of Cornell University; Su- 
perintendent J. M. Greenwood, of Kansas City; Hon. J. W. 
Brister, State Superintendent of Schools; President S. T. Wil- 
son, of Maryville College; Dr. James Arthur, of Greeneville; 
Hon. A. A. Taylor, Hon. John I. Cox, Hon. P. L. Harned, of 
Nashville; Dr. Olen West, Dr. T. B. Yancey, Mr. J. M. Gaunt,

Professor D. L. Earnest, Hon. Guy S. Chase, Hon. J. R. Gardner, 
and others. Superintendents J. L. Brooks, of Johnson City, 
and S. H. Thompson, of Athens, members of the State Board of 
Education, have co-operated enthusiastically with the faculty 
and have contributed much to the success of the school. They 
have been heard by the students i in excellent addresses a number 
of times. 
Many of the county and city superintendents of East Ten-

Johnson City have co-operated enthusiastically and each has ad- 
dressed the school one or more times. 
Arms AND Poticy. 
The scholastic population of the thirty-four counties in East 
Tennessee is 248,621. Of this number, 183,849, or 74 per cent, 
are enrolled in the public schools. The average daily attendance 
as shown by the latest available report was 127,129, or 51 per 
cent of the total scholastic population, or 69 per cent of the total 
enrollment. Of the total scholastic population in East Ten- 
nessee, 191,304, or 78 per cent, are able to read and write. Of 
the total enrollment of 183,849 in the public schools in East 
Tennessee, 56,671, or 31 per cent, are in the first grade, 28,333 
in the second grade, 27,064 in the third grade, 25,796 in the fourth 
grade, 19,692 in the fifth grade, 9,456 in the sixth grade, 6,202 in 
the seventh grade, 4,272, or a little more than 2 per cent, are in 
the eighth grade. The total enrollment in the county ‘high 
schools is 2,818, or about 1.5 per cent of the total s@holastic 
population. 
In East Tennessee there are 2,250 country public schools 
taught by 3,007 teachers, who work at an average salary of 
$233 a year each, and 84 city schools taught by 571 teachers, 
who work at an average salary of $444.60 a year each, The 
facts given above reveal the following conditions: 
. 1. There is a large percentage of illiteracy in the scholastic 
population. 
2. Many children who should be in school are not enrolled. 
8. Of those enrolled a large number are irregular in attend- 
ance.
-P-A-G-E-329
— 318 — 
4. Of the total enrollment nearly one-third is found in the 
first grade. 
5. A large majority of the school children quit school before 
reaching the fourth grade. . 
6. Very few. children complete the elementary school course. 
7. Nearly all the country schools are one-room, one-teacher 
schools. 
- 8. The low average yearly salary indicates a low grade of 
teaching efficiency. : 
While the purpose of the State Normal School, as defined 
by the General Education Law of 1909, is declared to be “For 
the education and professional training of teachers for the public 
schools of the State,” in a broader sense, it is interested in the 
investigation of all the problems given above, and in making 
better the conditions for living throughout the territory which 
it was established to serve. To this end all pupils who are ad- 
mitted to its courses must first sign a pledge-to contribute to 
the solution of the problems presented, by teaching in the public 
or private schools of the State at least as long as they attend the 
school, 
In the preparation for this work four general principles are 
recognized; first, thorough scholarship; second, the study of 
education as a science; third, practice in teaching under expert 
supervision; fourth, a thorough knowledge of educational con- 
ditions and needs in the State and the Nation. 
NEEDs. 
. The work of the first year revealed a number of pressing 
needs, as follows: 
First. Because of insufficient building funds it was possible 
to erect, only one dormitory, this to be occupied by women. 
In the dormitory there are forty-four rooms. After setting 
_ aside one for the use of the matron, forty-three are available 
for the use of young women. It was originally planned to have 
only two in each room, but early in the Spring Term ‘the demand 
for rooms became so great that an additional single bed was
-P-A-G-E-330
— 319 — 
placed in nearly all the bed-rooms with the consent of those al- 
ready in the rooms, and instead of providing accommodations 
for eighty-six women, as was originally planned, one hundred and 
seventeen women found lodging in the dormitory during the 
Spring and Summer Terms. After this over-crowding many 
young women were forced to find lodging in private homes and 
at increased expense to themselves. An additional dormitory 
for young women is an imperative need if the school is developed 
as it should be. The State should provide additional lodging 
for at least two hundred women, making it possible for at least 
three hundred to be cared for in the dormitories. 
Second. No dormitory has been provided for young men; 
consequently, all male students must find lodging in private 
homes. This condition not only makes the school less attrac- 
tive to men, but adds very materially to the expenses of those 
who do attend. A dormitory that will accommodate at least 
one hundred young men is needed, and it is hoped that provision 
can be made for such accommodations before the opening of 
another school year. The cost of lodging in private homes is 
from $4.00 to $5.00 a month, while in the dormitory it would be 
reduced to from $2.00 to $3.00 a month. 
Third. Additional kitchen and dining-room accommoda- 
tions are needed. The building now is use will care for from 150 
to 180 boarders. Last year, throughout the Spring and Summer 
Terms, it was crowded to its capacity, and with the larger en- 
rollment that is confidently expected for the coming year it 
will be impossible to conveniently and satisfactorily take care 
of ail the students who will apply for board. A new kitchen 
and dining-room should be erected, large enough to provide for 
at least 500 students and completely equipped with all modern 
conveniences. If this should be done the present dining-room 
could be used for manual training shops. 
Fourth. Every room in the main building has been occupied 
and some of the departments are badly over-crowded. This is 
particularly true of the classes in agriculture, manual training, 
domestic science and the sciences. It is impossible to provide 
sufficient rooms for laboratories in this building, and an additional 
building is needed to meet, not only the demands-of the school,
-P-A-G-E-331
—— 320 — 
but the demands of modern education for efficient work in these 
over-crowded , departments. I recommend, very earnestly, 
that the State Board of Education provide for the erection of an 
agriculture and science building sufficiently large to take care 
of all the work in these important departments, and fully equipped 
with everything necessary for their successful operation. 
Fifth. The school library, which must be made an important 
factor in the development of the Normal School, and which is 
so essential to the life and progress of the students, has not been 
adequately provided for. It has been possible to set aside for 
its use only one room in the main or academic building, and al- 
ready the demands made upon it are greater than the accommo- 
dations provided. The importance of the library is so great 
and its need by the student body and the school so imperative 
that I recommend that provision be made for.a library building. 
Sixth. The work done in the Normal School demands the 
very highest type of teaching efficiency. The young men and 
young women who attend the Normal School will go out from it 
as teachers in the public elementary schools of the State. If 
they are to do the best work for the State, it is necessary that 
they be taught in the Normal School by men and women of su- 
perior education, training and teaching ability. Each member 
of the Normal School faculty, in addition to his foundation of 
broad learning and liberal culture, should be a specialist in his 
department. The State cannot afford to employ as teachers in 
normal schools men and women who do not meet these high re- 
quirements. If an adequate teaching force in the Normal 
School is to be provided and needed additions to the faculty 
are to be made, the maintenance fund must be increased. The 
fund now available is not sufficient to provide the equipment 
needed and the general operating expenses of the school and pay 
the salaries of the number of instructors needed. 
The State has made a wise beginning with its normal schools, 
planning on broad and generous lines. The investment already 
made, to be preserved and -made to yield the largest returns, 
must be materially added to. The biggest business in which 
the State is, or can be, engaged is the proper education and train- 
ing of its children, and in this work the teacher is the dominant

-P-A-G-E-333

factor. If the teacher is to be professionally trained—and the 
welfare of the State demands it—adequate provision must be 
made through the normal schools for this training; and it should 
not be forgotten that the prime function of the normal schools 
is to educate and train teachers for the public elementary schools 
of the State. 
Conclusion. The co-operation of the members of the State 
Board of Education has been cordial, generous and helpful, and 
to each member I return my sincere thanks. The State Super- 
intendent of Public Instruction, at all times, has been. an en- 
thusiastic and helpful counsellor. To his wise suggestions much 
of the marked success that has attended the first year’s work 
has been due. The county and city superintendents and mem- 
bers of boards of education, without exception, have been most 
cordial in their co-operation and support. At all times the citi- 
zens of Johnson City and Washington County have given their 
most loyal support to the school. -The members of the faculty 
have worked in the utmost harmony, both with me and among 
each other, and have been uniformly zealous in promoting the 
best interests of the school. The student body has been loyal 
and responsive.

FIRST ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MIDDLE TENNESSEE 
NORMAL SCHOOL 
-Tue Hon. Stare Boarp oF EpucatTIon: 
Hon. J. W. BristErR, Secretary, 
: Nashville, Tennessee. 
Dear Str: In compliance with the provisions of Section 7, 
Chapter 264, Acts 1909, I have the honor of submitting to the 
State Board of Education, through you, as its Secretary, the 
first annual report of the Middle Tennessee State Normal 
School for the scholastic year ending June 30, 1912. 
Following the passage of the above named Act, creating the 
State Normal Schools, the Legislature passed another measure 
permitting counties and municipalities to issue bonds to the 
amount of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) each for 
the purpose of purchasing grounds and erecting and equipping 
buildings. Rutherford County appropriated $100,000 and the 
town of Murfreesboro $80,000. The expenditures are given in 
the financial table submitted at the close of the report. . 
The building was near enough completion for the school to 
open its first session Monday, September 11, 1912. The first 
day was devoted to the dedicatory exercises. Addresses ap- 
propriate to the occasion were delivered by State Superintendent 
J. W. Brister, Hon. Jno. Bell Keeble, Hon. A. L. Todd, Hon. 
G. B. Giltner, Dr. P. P. Claxton, Dr. Brown Ayres, and others. 
One hundred and twenty-five academic and ‘normal students 
matriculated at the date of opening, and the number increased 
to one hundred and seventy-five during the first term. During 
the second term the number of students increased to more than 
two hundred and sixty, and during the third term the total en- 
rollment reached three hundred and forty-seven. Of this num- 
ber ninety-six were males and two hundred and fifty-one were 
females. 
The representation from the various counties in attendance 
at the Middle Tennessee State Normal School was as follows:

FAcuLTY. 
The faculty is composed of men and women who have had 
thorough training for their work and successful experience. 
’ 
STUDENTS. 
The student body is made up of earnest, ambitious young 
men and women, many of whom have taught and are defraying 
their own expenses. We feel that they will prove a rich contri- 
bution to the teaching profession and will do well their part of 
the world’s work. 
The courses of study were made and are being adjusted with 
a view to meeting the modern conditions of life. Good courses 
are offered in the classics, sciences, mathematics, history, agri- 
culture, manual training and home economics, with special 
stress being placed on the science and art of teaching. 
The Manual Arts Department occupies the north wing of 
basement, having five rooms with a floor space of over 3,600 
square feet set apart for this important work. The equipment 
throughout is on the basis of twelve students to the class; this 
basis will be increased to sixteen within the next year—the maxi- 
mum number to one instructor. There are twelve benches in 
the work shop made of selected maple and beautifully finished.
-P-A-G-E-340
— 327 — 
Each bench is fully equipped with individual tools and rapid 
acting vises. A large cabinet contains the general tools. Special 
cabinets conveniently arranged about the room contain the gen- 
eral supplies and finishing materials. The shop also has a dem- 
onstration bench for the instructor and a large scroll saw and a 
finishing table. This equipment will be added to from time to 
time. The art-metal shop contains a full equipment and all 
the necessary supplies for the principal exercises known to the 
arts and trade in manipulating copper and brass into articles 
of use and interest. A large work, table 20 feet long, with nu- 
merous closets and drawers, occupies the center of the room. A 
central rack runs the full length with dozens of special hammers, 
jeweler’s saw frames, compasses, gages, snips, etc. Convenient 
shelves hold anvil heads and stakes to hammering to form. 
Other equipment consists of an electric polishing lathe, annealing 
bed, hand drills, chemical baths and numerous cabinets of 
supplies. The drafting room is furnished with adjustable draw- 
ing tables, drawing boards, T-squares, instructor's desk, etc 
It is also the general lecture room. 
DomEstic SCIENCE. 
The domestic laboratory is provided with twelve double 
cabinets, giving twenty-four individual desks. These desks 
are of walnut, with white opalite tops. Twelve are fitted with a 
model kitchen outfit, and equipment for six additional ones was 
purchased by the students with the proceeds of a candy market. 
The department has enrolled more than one hundred: and 
fifty girls, which puts the laboratory in use the entire day for 
four days in the week and for several hours the other two days. 
Consequently, the wear and tear is great, even with the utmost 
care. Two large classes are from the training school, and to 
accommodate them it is necessary to furnish the remaining desks. 
A reserve stock should be on hand to replace worn out vessels. 
To do this a dozen desk equipments, at a cost of about $3.25 
each, will be needed. The equipment was planned with a view 
to adding gradually to it the latest and best improvements in 
domestic science equipment. To make lessons in baking, 
broiling and roasting practical, it is necessary that each girl 
do all the work; this is impossible without individual ovens.
-P-A-G-E-341
— 3238 — 
Since the rooms are provided with gas, these could be installed 
at slight expense. Each stove is double, consisting of two ovens 
and two burners on top, the ovens not connected so that it is 
the same as individual stoves but somewhat cheaper. Twelve 
such stoves are needed, and the cost is probably $6.50 or $7.00 
each. Double sinks are needed, fitted back to back. .- These 
cost something like $5.00. each, and twelve will be required. 
The general equipment of ranges and utensils is complete 
and in good condition. The model dining-room is without fur- 
niture. A table, eight chairs and a china closet or buffet of 
good material and substantial make are needed for lessons in 
table service, decoration and care of dining-room. The girls of 
the department have provided a floor covering, which will be 
purchased and put into ‘use as soon as possible. The stock of 
silver and china is inadequate to our needs in entertaining, and 
the social life of the institution centers in this department. 
Four large functions were served last year, and on each occasion 
it was necessary to rent or borrow service. The sample china 
service now in the dining room cari be completed for $50. This 
will give'a service of the necessary dishes and platters and five 
dozen each of plates, cups and saucers, which would be sufficient 
for any ordinary occasion. A like addition should be made to 
the silver, but I cannot now give the approximate cost. 
The domestic art room is in need of one machine for fine work, 
those. in use being equal to ordinary work. The adjustable 
form is needed for fitting waists and regulating skirt lengths. 
One quarter’s work this year will be given to dress making. A 
full length mirror is also needed. 
The entire department is without chairs or stools. Two 
dozen stools, with or without backs, will be needed in the Do- 
mestic Science Laboratory, and one dozen low chairs for the 
serving room. 
ScIENTIFIC EQUIPMENT. 
The division of Physics and Chemistry in the Department of 
Science has the use of the five large rooms that occupy the 
whole of the west wing of the first floor of ‘the main building. 
The total floor space aggregates about 7,000 square feet, thus 
giving to the department all it could desire in the matter of 
commodiousness and convenience of quarters. All the roorms
-P-A-G-E-342
— 329 — 
are thoroughly lighted, and being located on a ground floor of 
cement, all vibration is eliminated. The physical and chemical 
laboratories are in different rooms, so that the corrosion of fine 
physical instruments by chemical fumes is avoided; but at the 
same time they are near enough to each other to facilitate the 
frequent intercourse between them that is always necessary. 
A perfect system of artificial ventilation operated by means of 
special flues connected to an exhaust fan that is driven by an 
electric motor, has been planned and partially installed. 
Room 1, 26 x 30 feet, is used for the balances and cabinets 
of physical apparatus. It contains 10 balances for coarse 
weighing, used by the students of physics, and 8 balances for 
fine weighing, used by the students of chemistry. All these 
are mounted on wall shelves of stone. It has a large cabinet of 
oak and glass for physical apparatus. : 
Room 2, 30 x 40 feet, is used for the department’s recitations, 
demonstrations and lectures. It has an excellent lecture table 
of oak with a soap-stone top. This table has many conveniences, 
such as water, fuel gas, oxygen, hydrogen, hydrogen sulphide, 
and -compressed air, which are needed in thé demonstration of 
experiments. The room will seat about 100 students. 
Room 3, 26 x 63 feet, is the chemical laboratory. It has 
four handsome and very serviceable double chemical tables of 
oak, each 16 feet long, with a stone trough and bottle rack run- 
ning the entire length. Three of these tables have stone tops 
and 16 lockers each, 48 lockers in all, which are supplied with 
most of the apparatus needed for the first year of chemistry; 
while the fourth of the same length has only 12 larger lockers 
which are supplied with apparatus for the second year of chemis- 
try. Each locker in all four tables has hot and cold water, fuel 
gas, compressed air, hydrogen, oxygen and hydrogen sulphide. 
The laboratory, as a whole, is well supplied with apparatus and 
reagents. 
~ Room 4, 30 x 40 feet, is an excellent physical laboratory. It 
has six tables for physical experiments, éach 4 x 8 feet, and each 
having underneath a cabinet divided into two lockers, making 
12 lockers in all. Each locker has a complete outfit of apparatus 
for the first year’s work, and is assigned to a group of 4 students. 
Thus 48 students can be accommodated at one time, and by work-
-P-A-G-E-343
— 330 — 
ing in sections nearly 100 students are doing efficient laboratory 
work in this important branch at present. 
Room 5, 18 x 80 feet, is used as a chemical store and prepa- 
ration room. It has ample facilities in the way of shelves, and 
a very convenient and handsome cabinet of large dimensions 
built of oak and glass, in the middle of the room. 
It is believed that few schools have better equipment for 
these branches at so moderate a cost, about $3,500. 
Farm. 
The school site embraces about one hundred acres of ground, 
fifty acres of which are available for farm lands. The soil is 
somewhat worn and is lacking in lime and humus, but it yields 
readily to treatment, and in a few years can be made immensely 
rich. Owing to its run down condition it will not be self-sustain- 
ing for the first year or two. Rotation work, plot work, truck 
gardening and school gardening are being tried out, and we be- 
lieve this work will prove highly educative. 
ScHooL GARDEN. 
A. plat of ground is set aside for school gardens, and each 
student in nature study, biology or agriculture is given one one- 
hundred sixtieth of an acre on which to plant a school garden. 
’ Many of these plats were successfully cultivated last year with 
gratifying results, and much better efforts are expected during 
the present year. 
DEMONSTRATION PLats. 
Demonstrations on plats containing one-fortieth of an acre 
of land, on which different.crops will be grown under different con- 
ditions, will be maintained next year. A certain plat of ground 
has been set aside for truck farming, on which vegetables - will 
be grown for supplying the dormitory. The remaining farm 
lands will be used for producing feed crops for the farm stock 
with due stress placed on proper rotation and tillage, so that 
even this feature of farming will have an educative as well as a 
profit-making value.
-P-A-G-E-344

Farm Stock. 
We have on the farm a pair of Percheron mares and a pair 
of large mules for doing the work on the farm and the campus. 
While this stock is primarily for farm work, yet they are good 
models and are used for stock judging. Two strains of thor- 
oughbred hogs are kept on the farm—Berkshires and Jersey- 
Durocs. While we were unfortunate in losing several good hogs 
from cholera last year, yet the growth on those saved from dis- 
ease about equalled the loss of those dying from cholera, so that 
we have not sustained a real loss. I want to thank the State Live 
Stock. Inspector, Dr. White, for his official service is diagnosing 
and prescribing for the disease. He prescribed the anti-cholera 
serum which was applied with success to the hogs that were not 
infected. This serum was applied in the presence and with the 
assistance of the class in agriculture. If we are not disturbed 
by cholera or other diseases, we believe hog growing will prove 
to be of not only educative value to the students, but will prove 
highly profitable to the Normal financially, and of great value 
to the future stock-growing interest of the State. We have at 
present eight thoroughbred Duroc-Jerseys, eleven thoroughbred 
Berkshires and a few fattening hogs to consume the swill fur- 
nished from the dining hall and kitchen. 
POULTRY. 
Two strains of pure bred poultry are kept, the Plymoth Rock 
and the Leghorn, one representing the combination strain of 
hen good for both laying and broiling purposes, the other strictly 
the laying variety. It is believed the poultry” department will 
be at least self-sustaining. 
Cows. 
We have at present no cows on the farm. If we had a dairy 
barn and equipment, I believe we could keep ten or twelve good 
cows with financial profit to the school and of great educative 
value to the students. 
DRAINAGE. 
I desire to’call the attention of the Board to the fact that water 
stands in the basin between the building and Main Street for
-P-A-G-E-345
— 332 — 
several consecutive days during the rainy season. This pond 
covers about three acres of the Normal campus and stands at a 
depth of two feet over the road. It is necessary that some action 
be taken at an early date looking to the relief of this situation 
by proper drainage. It greatly interferes, during the high water 
seasons, with the students boarding in town and the occupants 
of the Boy’s Dormitory, necessitating, as it does, their walking 
a considerable distance around through muddy fields and climb- 
ing fences in order to reach the Normal buildings.. A portion of 
the farm lands lying on the north end of the farm is submerged 
during a period of successive rains, and is therefore rendered 
valueless for growing crops. An expert of the U.S. Government 
is making, without cost to the State, a drainage map of the school 
farm and campus on which will be shown all areas requiring 
drainage, and the approximate cost of doing same. When this 
map is completed, the data will be furnished your honorable 
Board. Much land in Middle Tennessee needs drainage very 
badly, and while it will incur some expense to the State to drain 
this low land, yet it will not be without its compensation to the 
State in demonstrating the value of drainage for low farm lands. 
AGRICULTURE. 
The north half of the first floor of the east wing of the building 
is dedicated to the teaching of Agriculture. There are four 
rooms, one of which is used for a lecture room, one for agricul- 
tural literature, including bulletins, reports, etc., one. for storing 
agricultural products and one for a biological laboratory. 
The latter is furnished with good tables and chairs, microscopes, 
hand lenses and a small collection of specimens, While the equip- 
_ment is not elaborate, it is thoroughly usable and we feel a good . 
beginning has been made. 
Lecture Rooms. 
All the lecture rooms are furnished with recitation’ seats 
having stationary arms, except the study hall and rooms in the 
Model School, which are furnished with good modern single 
desks.
-P-A-G-E-346
— 333 — 
LIBRARY. 
The State Board of Education very wisely set aside last year 
one thousand dollars ($1,000) for purchasing suitable books for 
the library. This was supplemented by a book reception given 
by the faculty on March roth, from which we received more 
than eight hundred volumes. We now have in the library 
about two thousand volumes of good supplemental and reference 
works, This should be largely added to each year. 
’ Dormtirory. 
The young women’s dormitory was taxed to its full capacity 
during the second term of the school, and every room has been 
occupied since. We can accommodate one hundred and six in 
the building. We could easily have three hundred young women 
in the Normal, if we only had facilities for caring for them in the 
dormitory. A large residence was rented for the use of a boys’ 
dormitory, in which twenty-five young men could secure lodging. 
Good board is being furnished all the occupants of the dormi- 
tories at $10 per month. 
From eight to twelve young women defray their boarding 
expenses by waiting on the table, and a good many worthy young 
men earn enough money to defray a part of their expenses by 
work on the farm or the campus. : 
STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS. 
There are four active literary societies, two for the young 
women and two for the young men. These societies meet weekly, 
and are contributing much to the value and the interest of the 
school. 
The Y. M. C. A. and the Y. W. C. A. each have a good or- 
ganization with a large membership. These organizations are 
exerting a wholesome influence on the student body. 
PHysicaL CULTURE. 
While our gymnasium is not elaborately equipped, yet it is 
very serviceable and a large number of students take the work 
with both pleasure and profit.
-P-A-G-E-347
— 334 — 
ATHLETICS. 
Despite the fact that we have not a coach, the young men 
through their own efforts have worked up a creditable team both 
in football and baseball and a fine athletic spirit prevails. We 
hope by another year to be able to secure a coach. 
ATTENDANCE. 
The attendance, as shown by the summary, is large and rep- 
resentative of a wide section of the State. The spirit of the school 
is good, and we believe the future of the institution is. bright. 
However, we fully realize that the institution is too young to 
demonstrate that it is either a success or a failure, and that its 
future growth justly depends on the character of service it ren- 
ders the public schools of the State in the preparation of those 
who are to become teachers. Feeling keenly this responsibility, 
it is the duty of those connected with the Normal schools to 
study the real needs of the public schools, to the end that, they 
may contribute most intelligently to the solution of our public 
school problems. 
NEEDS OF THE INSTITUTION. 
1. With the rapid growth of the school the present funds are 
not sufficient to meet the necessary running expenses and pro- 
vide for the development of the school plant, hence, the main- 
tenance fund must be increased, if the growth of the school is 
to be maintained. 
2. To accommodate the boarding students, and to enable 
the school to be brought within the reach of all at the minimum 
cost, it is necessary to increase the dormitory facilities. The 
State has spent for buildings, equipment and grounds nearly 
two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. It has erected a mag- 
nificent administration building, containing fifty good, usable 
rooms and an auditorium that will seat one thousand people. 
There is ample space in this building for one thousand students, 
and, as stated above, we have dormitory accommodations for 
one hundred. By spending a reasonable amount for an addi- 
tional dormitory the ability of the school to care for boarding 
- students would be increased threefold.
-P-A-G-E-348

In conclusion, I desire to thank the State Board of Education 
for their kind, cordial support and for the uniform courtesies 
extended. : :

FIRST ANNUAL REPORT OF THE WEST TENNESSEE 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOL. - 
THE HONORABLE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION: 
Hon.J. W. BrisTER, . 
” State Superintendent of Public Instruction, Secretary, 
Nashville, Tennessee. 
DEAR Sir: The Act of 1909, known as the General Education 
Bill, requires all schools receiving benefits under said Act to 
make annual reports to the State Superintendent of Public 
Instruction. 
The West Tennessee Normal School was not in operation 
during the year ending June 30, 1912, but in order to comply 
with the above mentioned Act, I herewith submit the following 
report of work and progress of the school for that period. 
The State Board of Education, in accordance with the Act, 
selected a site for the West Tennessee State Normal School, 
seven miles east of Memphis on the Southern Railway, and agreed 
to locate the school here on the following conditions, namely: 
The County of Shelby agreed to issue two hundred thousand 
dollars- ($200,000) in bonds, the city of Memphis $150,000 and 
the people of the locality where the school was to be located 
agreed to give forty-nine acres of land, all for the benefit of the 
school. The State Board of Education agreed to purchase 
thirty-two acres additional and to furnish the right of way for 
Street Railway Company to the site. 
The county issued at once one hundred thousand dollars 
($100,000) in bonds and turned the proceeds over to the State 
Comptroller, but under the Act of the Legislature they would 
not exceed that amount. The bond attorneys gave an opinion 
that the city had no right to issue bonds when the institution was’ 
to be built outside the city limits. This made it necessary to 
wait for an amendment of the General Act and a special enabling 
Act forthe city. These Acts were passed by the General Assem- 
bly of1911. In the meantime plans were selected and con- 
tracts let for buildings and improvements.
-P-A-G-E-351
7 338 — 
At the meeting of the State Board of Education, held in 
January, 1911, I was elected President, to begin active service 
on June Ist of that year. I came to Memphis on the date speci- 
fied and took charge of the improvements and business connected 
with the school. It was first found necessary to revise the con- 
tracts in order to bring the work within the limits of the means 
available. In accordance with the original agreement the forty- 
nine acre tract of land was deeded to the State and thirty-two 
acres additional purchased by the State Board of Education: 
‘The Alexander Construction Company commenced work prompt- 
ly on the buildings and pushed them to completion as quickly 
as possible. It was impossible to open school before September, 
1912, or after the date for which this report is made. The State 
Board of Education held a special meeting in Memphis on April 
28, 1912, for the purpose of receiving bids and purchasing furni- 
ture for the building. 
The approximate cost for building and equipment has been 
four hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($450,000) and vouchers 
for all expenses are filed with the State Superintendent and 
State Comptroller. 
As president of the school it was my duty to look after the 
contracts of the County and State Board, take general super- 
vision of the buildings, the nomination of the faculty, prepara- 
tion of the course of study, and general field work and working 
up the school interest for the coming year. For this purpose 
I visited the teachers’ meetings in all the counties of West Ten- 
nessee, and made educational addresses in a large number of 
tural districts. I prepared and issued three bulletins of the 
school which were generally distributed throughout West Ten- 
nessee. 
In order to have the farm land in shape for use this year, I 
had much work done on the place, clearing the land, filling 
gullies, etc. I also had about six acres plowed and put in corn, 
‘peas and sweet potatoes. The expense of the plowing and culti- 
vation of the crop amounted to one hundred and two dollars 
($102.00), the value, as estimated by. Prof. Bright, who took 
charge of the Department of Agriculture-on September 1, 1912, 
was one hundred and sixty five dollars ($165.00), and all was 
turned over to him for the use of his department.
-P-A-G-E-352
— 339 — 
While it would not properly be part of this report, still it 
will show the interest in the school to state the present condition. 
The school was opened on September 9, and has enrolled at this 
writing, November 21, three hundred and thirty pupils. In 
this number are representatives from every county in West 
Tennessee but one, with a number from Middle Tennessee, and 
adjoining states. 
The Fall Term will close in two weeks and prospects are 
very bright for increased enrollment for the new term. 
Very respectfully submitted, 
Seymour A. Mynpers, President.

FIRST ANNUAL REPORT OF THE AGRICULTURAL 
AND INDUSTRIAL STATE NORMAL 
SCHOOL FOR NEGROES. 
THE STATE BoarD OF EDUCATION: 
Hon. J. W. Brister, Secretary, 
Nashville, Tennessee. ° 
The first session of the Agricultural and Industrial Normal 
School for Negroes opened with the Teachers’ Summer Session, 
June 19th, continuing three weeks, under the direction of the State 
Board of Education. There was in attendance at this session 
more than two hundred and fifty enthusiastic teachers from 
various sections of Tennessee and other states. 
The Fall Term began September 16, 1912, with 13 teachers 
and an enrollment of two hundred and thirty students, all grades 
above the third. Since that time the enrollment has increased 
to three hundred and forty and is fast approaching four hundred. 
Every section of the State, as well as neighboring states, are 
represented among the student body. A large number of the 
students are working their way through school. 
The dormitories are nearly filled to their capacity. 
Before the school opened, it was announced that board would 
be given the students at about six dollars a month. Considering 
the high cost of living, this was a hazardous proposition, but by 
very careful management, the school has succeeded thus far in 
providing good substantial table fare at the price named. The 
food is wholesome and at all times prepared and served under 
sanitary conditions, nearly all of the work being done by stu- 
dents. 
The students are very appreciative of the equipment given 
by the State and are endeavoring at all times and under all cir- 
cumstances to beautify the buildings and grounds. This has 
been shown by the spirit with which they entered into the work 
of “Clean Up Day,” which was planned and assisted in by all 
the members of the faculty. Since that time there have been 
several such days on which all again co-operated in the work, 
bringing about a vast change in the appearance of the campus.
-P-A-G-E-354
— 341 — 
In fact, the spirit, in a general way, existing among the students, 
among the teachers, and between the teachers and the students 
is an admirable one. . . 
The.work of the entire school is exceptionally well organized 
and systematized. This means that each department is playing | 
well its part. . 
The Domestic Art and Science Departments are making it 
possible for the student to have both theory and practice in 
sewing and cooking. More than 200 are enrolled. 
The young men and young women are exceptionally fortunate 
in having such modern and comfortable quarters. The buildings 
are three story bricks with steam heat, electric lights, bathrooms, 
with hot and cold water, sixty-six outside large, bright and well- 
ventilated bedrooms, with two large clothes closets in each. 
Each room is furnished with shades, iron enameled beds, springs, 
mattress, dresser, washstand, center table, a straight chair and 
rocker. The young people have taken enough pride and in- 
terest. in their rooms to buy window and closet curtains, dresser, 
table and stand covers, and they have fitted up, at their expense, 
reading rooms, and hospital rooms, cost of which is thirty dol- 
lars. . 
All the work in the buildings is done by the young men and 
young women students, under the supervision of two excellent 
matrons, who rotate the work so as to give a complete round of 
housekeeping and nurse-training experiences to each boy and 
girl, and at the same time hold before them a high standard of 
living. Nearly all girls and boys do their own laundering. 
Our aim is to make the life, as lived here, a model for students as 
home makers. 
Tue AcADEMIC DEPARTMENT. 
The purpose of the Academic Department of the State Nor- 
mal School is to give the pupil a good moral and educational- 
foundation, and a. thorough knowledge of all public school sub- 
jects, not only from the pupils’ view point, but also from the 
standpoint of having him teach others. In every branch of 
work, self-activity, real work, accuracy and neatness are em- 
phasized. ~
-P-A-G-E-355
— 842 — 
The subjects considered fundamental in this department are 
reading, English and arithmetic, because they are so essential 
to those who are being trained as teachers. Realizing the truth 
of the statement, ‘Knowledge is a treasure, but practice is the 
key of it,’ every history lesson, every class in science, every 
“geography recitation becomes a grammar class, a reading class, 
a spelling class, a time not only to give knowledge and to dis- 
cover how much the pupil knows, but to train him to use what 
he knows. : 
THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. 
This department is laying a foundation which it hopes will 
prove to be the basis of a better farm economy throughout the 
entire State of Tennessee. Theoretically, we hope to teach the 
agriculture according to its most accepted scientific principles, 
and embody both zootechny and agronomy. We are organizing 
the school farm to serve as a model for practical farmers. The 
farm will embody as many branches as are consistent with good 
business and cover in its scope the larger agricultural interests 
of the State. It plans to supply all the dairy and garden pro- 
ducts consuméd by the school as well as all its bacon and veal. 
A slaughter house and curing establishment will be connected 
with the farm. 
Under the auspices of this department will be conducted ex- 
tension work, farmers’ institutes and corn clubs, the State over. 
It will be. the especial function of this department to organize 
and foster the home garden and poultry raising in the back 
yards and on vacant lots of city dwellers. This simple scheme 
alone will save annually to the citizens of the State of Tennessee 
the initial cost of the Normal. 
THE MECHANICAL DEPARTMENT. . 
The school proposes to offer courses in the following trades: 
Carpentry, blacksmithing and wheelwrighting, painting, brick- 
laying and plastering, plumbing, shoemaking, and cabinet mak- 
ing. Mechanical drawing is given as a part of the training of 
all trade students except the shoemakers, and they have free- 
hand drawing instead.
-P-A-G-E-356
— 343 — 
The advantage of entering this department is that one can 
take a trade by logical and systematic steps from beginning to 
end. , 
It is not enough for a person to be styled a good workman, who 
perhaps is able to perform a good job of work after it is laid out 
for him by a more competent hand; the workman of today must 
understand the principles of his trade and be able to apply them 
in practice. The aim of the department will be to prepare stu- 
dents to fill positions as first-class workmen, foremen and teachers 
of their craft. 
Mechanical Drawing—The drawing is arranged with a view 
to giving the student a general knowledge of working drawings, 
preparing him to read these intelligently, cultivating his ability 
to make working drafts, plans, elevations and sections of tools, 
buildings, machines, wagons, and other work in the line of his 
trade, and to build according to the same. 
SPECIAL NEEDS. 
1. Apparatus and equipment for the academic, agricultural 
and mechanical departments. 
2. The official endorsement of the superintendents, school 
boards—all school officials. . 
The success the school has made since the few weeks of its 
life is wonderful. Seldom, if ever, has a negro State school made 
such rapid progress. The credit is largely due to the State 
Superintendent and the State Board of Education. : 
In the location of the school, the contracting for the buildings 
and the selection of equipment and high type teachers, you have 
shown unusual good judgment and liberal disposition toward the 
Brother in Black. The full school and success is the answer the 
negroes of the State are making. The Board has given the petty 
politician and calamity howler (the usual destroyers of negro 
State schools) scant consideration. - 
Our watchword is ‘Think, work, serve.” 
Sincerely yours, . / 
W. J. Hae, President.

THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE. 
To the Honorable Superintendent of Public Instruction of Ten- 
nessee: 
Dear Sir: In accordance with long established custom and 
in obedience to Section 9 of the General Education Bill of 1909, 
I take pleasure in submitting my report of the organization, work 
and financial operations of the University of Tennessee for the 
biennial period of 1910-11 and 1911-12. 
The development of the University during the past two years 
has been steady and satisfactory. The provision by the Legis- 
lature of a certain income, under the provisions of the General 
Education Bill, has enabled the Board of Trustees to lay out 
definite and far-sighted lines of advance and to move along these 
lines with a confidence that would otherwise have been impossible. 
The formal recognition of the University as the head of the public 
school system of the State has emphasized its duty along certain 
educational lines in a way to rather definitely fix its future policy. 
Tennessee is fortunate among her sister states of the South in 
that she has not been so unwise as to multiply her higher in- 
stitutions of learning. In many other states a great waste re- 
sults from duplication of plants and operating expenses without 
corresponding educational advantages. In fact, the strongest 
development of higher education in all its phases has taken 
place in those states in which there has been concentration on a 
single great State University. Where mistakes have been 
made in the establishment of two or more separate institutions 
the trend in the most progressive states is toward such a delimi- 
tation of the activities of each as to prevent wasteful duplica- 
tion, the object being to secure an approximation to the most 
economical and ideal condition—the single university. 
Taking its cue from the action of the Legislature in placing 
it at the head of the public school system and guided by the 
aggregated experience of the great state universities of the 
country, the University will strive to provide in its courses 
of study for all the legitimate demands fer higher education 
from the young men and young women of the State. It will rest 
its courses squarely on the four year high school, as defined
-P-A-G-E-365
— 352 — 
and outlined by the State Department of Public Instruction, and 
will provide a continuation course for the high school graduate in 
any one of the officially outlined courses. In each of these con- 
tinuation courses it will provide adequately, in professors and 
equipment, for the conduct of the work along the most modern 
and progressive lines. 
With the broader ideals of citizenship which are now being 
more and more recognized, the University will interpret its duty 
to the women of the State as not less pressing than its duty to 
the men. Women are welcome in all courses, whether general or 
professional, in which they may become interested. In addition, 
their interests will be especially considered in a number of courses 
peculiarly adapted to their tastes and needs. Whether a 
woman’s future career is to be a professional or business one, 
. or whether it is to be the fundamentally important one of home- 
maker and mother, she has a right to demand of the State as full 
training for her life as has the man citizen for his. But. con- 
ditions should be made for her by which her training is had 
under satisfactory social, hygienic and refining influences.

ADVANCE In STANDARDS. * 
With the constant purpose of placing the University ona plane 
with the best state universities of the land, insofar as this can 
be done with the means available for the purpose, there has been 
a steady elevation of requirements for admission, until at the 
present time fourteen standard units is required for admission to 
all courses and colleges of the University, except the College 
of Dentistry and the School of Pharmacy. The standard of 
these latter departments is that of the National Association of 
- Dental Faculties and of the standard schools of pharmacy. It 
is about ten units, or the completion of a three year high school 
course. The colleges of liberal arts, engineering, agriculture, 
law and medicine all require for full admission the completion of 
a four year standard high school course. It is hoped that the 
national organizations fixing the standards in ‘dentistry and 
pharmacy will soon advance the requirements for those courses 
to the same point. : 
I desire to emphasize the facts above stated. The University 
has no preparatory or subfreshmen department. A subfreshman 
class was operated for two years (1909-11) while standards were 
being raised, but it was discontinued at the close of the session 
of 1910-11. A student may be admitted conditioned if he pre- 
sents not less than twelve units. But no student is admitted 
to any course on less than twelve units, unless he or she is twenty- 
one years of age or over, when they may be admitted as special 
students. Nostudent is admitted as a special unless he is twenty- 
one years of age. The fact that this very satisfactory standard 
has been reached with a steady increase in attendance ‘is grati- 
fying. 
FREE AND REDUCED TUITION. 
The fact that tuition is,free in the colleges of liberal arts, 
engineering and agriculture, and in the school of education, to 
the young men and women of Tennessee, and that'the State pays 
the traveling expenses of the students from their homes to the 
University and return, brings the splendid advantages of the 
institution within the reach of the poorest boy or girl in the State 
who is qualified to take advantage of them. By loan funds 
and some opportunities for self-help the advantages are in-
-P-A-G-E-370
— 357 — 
creased. Taken all in all, there is no institution of equal rank 
that offers so much to the youth of the State. A concession in 
fees to Tennesseans is made in the College of Medicine, and it is 
hoped that in the near future it may be possible to make still 
further concessions in all the professional schools. 
_ Tae CARNEGIE LIBRARY. 
The new library building of the University, which was con- 
structed’ largely with funds donated for the purpose by Mr. 
Andrew Carnegie, is one of the most complete and satisfactory 
college libraries in the South. It has now been in use for some- 
thing more than a year and has proven eminently satisfactory 
in every way. Its ‘acquisition has meant much for the literary 
life of the University, and it is greatly appreciated by both 
students and professors. It is in charge of two expert librarians, 
able college graduates who have subsequently graduated in the 
best library school in the country. They have sufficient and 
proper clerical and mechanical assistance to make possible the 
organization and conduct of the library work according to the 
most approved methods. The opportunity to work in this 
library alone should be sufficient to determine a student on the 
choice of this University. An increasing fund is annually avail- 
able for the purchase of books and for the binding of sets of peri- 
odicals, etc. 
TENNESSEE HALL. 
Since the opening of the session of 1911-12 the University 
has had the advantage of the use of a special building for the 
work in home economics and in drawing and art for women. 
This building is the property of the Board of Trustees of the East 
Tennessee Female Institute. By a very favorable contract with 
these trustees the University has secured the use of the building 
for ten years, subject to renewal if it still feels the need of it. 
While this building is not on the University campus, it is within 
convenient walking distance and will answer admirably for the 
use made of it until such time as it is possible to erect a proper 
building for these purposes on our own grounds. The work 
in home economics here has been eminently successful in past 
years, but it has suffered somewhat from the crowded and un-
-P-A-G-E-371
— 358 — 
suitable quarters in which it was installed. The new building 
gives ample and attractive rooms for cooking and sewing labora- 
tories, for a model dining room and for necessary class rooms and. 
offices. The securing of this building made it possible to handle 
much larger classes in domestic science and domestic art, and 
“we were therefore able to offer to the county and city superin- 
tendents of the State the privilege of appointment to free schol- 
arships in the Summer School of a certain number of persons 
from their respective districts. A number of persons were sent 
up by them and it is hoped that some stimulus to the introduc- 
tion of domestic science in the schools was given thereby. A 
similar opportunity will be offered to the teachers in the Summer 
School of 1912. 
OLIVER PERRY TEMPLE HALL. 
During the past year there has been completed on the Uni- 
versity Farm the erection of the Oliver Perry Temple. Hall. 
This fine pavillion was erected by the East Tennessee Farmers’ 
Convention, which has met annually at the University for many 
years, for use as its meeting place. It has been named in honor 
of the late Judge Oliver Perry Temple, who was the first president 
of the Convention and a trustee of the University for more than 
fifty years. This building will not only serve as a meeting 
place for the Convention, but will be useful in the agricultural 
work of the University, especially for its short courses in agri- 
culture and for the regular work in animal husbandry. The 
thanks of all friends of the University and its work is due to the 
Convention for its far-sighted liberality. 
Tue ScHOoL or EpucaTION. 
The well recognized need of a collegiate education for all . 
teachers in high schools makes it desirable that the University 
should expand and strengthen its work in education. To this 
end an additional chair in education has been created since the 
filing of my last report. The School of Education as now organ- 
ized includes a chair of general education, held by Professor 
Edward E. Rall, Ph.D., a graduate of the State Normal School 
and the University of Iowa, and of Yale University.and Teachers’
-P-A-G-E-372
— 359 — 
_ College, and late of the University of Texas; and a chair of 
secondary education, held by Professor Harry H. Clark, a grad- 
uate of Yale University, formerly principal of the Fayette County 
High School at Somerville, and late Professor of English in the 
Middle Tennessee Normal School. In co-opetation with our 
Professor of Psychology, Dr. Robert Morris Ogden, and a number 
of the faculty of the University who are giving courses in the 
pedagogy of their respective subjects, there has been arranged 
a series of excellent special courses for the training of high school 
teachers. The increasing number of young men and young 
women in the University who are looking to the teaching pro- 
fession is gratifying. It will be our object to advance this work 
from year to year in every practicable way. 
THE COLLEGE oF Law. 
In accord with its policy of steady advance in the character 
of its work, the University has lengthened the course in the Col- 
lege of Law to three years, requiring for admission to the first 
year of the course the completion of a four year high school 
course, or its equivalent. This brings our law school into line 
with the best practice throughout the country and with the 
standard of the American Association of Law Schools. It is 
not too much to expect a young man preparing for a learned pro- 
fession, such as the law, to devote to his preparation the time 
necessary for satisfactory results. I am-pleased to report, that 
the advance ‘has been generally commended and that there 
is an excellent prospect now for the building up of a School of 
Law that will be a source of pride to the State. — 
COLLEGE OF MEDICINE. 
In my last biennial report I gave an account of the arrange- 
ment with the University of Nashville for the conduct by the 
two universities of a joint medical department at Nashville. 
This joint department was very successfully operated for two 
years, establishing a new standard for medical teaching in Nash- 
ville by the strengthening of laboratory courses and by the es- 
tablishment of The Tennessee Hospital under the entire charge 
of the medical faculty and therefore available for clinical in-
-P-A-G-E-373
— 360 — 
struction in a way more satisfactory than was ever before possible 
in that city. 
The practical difficulties of developing the school under 
such partnership arrangement were, however, very great. 
Hence, by mutual consent, for the greater advance of medical 
teaching, the contract between the two universities was termi- 
nated at the close of the session of 1910-11, and the Board of 
Trustees of the University of Nashville, having decided to with- 
draw from medical instruction, transferred to the Board of 
Trustees of the University of Tennessee all of its equipment in 
the college and hospital, and also the good will of its medical 
department, by specific action authorizing the Board of Trus- 
tees of the University of Tennessee to claim the Medical College 
to be operated by it as the legal successor and continuation of 
the medical department formerly operated by them. 
The Board of Trustees of the University of Tennessee has 
also acquired the property, equipment and good will of the 
College of Physicians and Surgeons of the University of Memphis, 
a young institution, but one full of vigor and high ideals, and has 
transferred to Memphis all of the scientific equipment, museums, 
’ etc., of the former Nashville departments. By such transfer 
and combination of the three medical schools,- the College of 
Medicine of the University of Tennessee, as it will now be called, 
has acquired a very extensive equipment and large hospital 
facilities and has been greatly strengthened. The way is now 
open, under a single management, to develop a great State School 
of Medicine. 
In carrying forward their plans to put this school on a level 
with the other departments of the University and on well ap- 
proved and accepted standards, the trustees have already ap- 
Pointed several professors giving their entire time to teaching 
the fundamental branches of medicine, and have erected a splen- 
did laboratory building to secure additional needed space. 
Memphis is an excellent location for a great school of medicine, 
and the removal from Nashville to that city has proven to be 
eminently wise. The one session that has been operated at 
Memphis was remarkably successful. The session lately begun 
has opened under much improved conditions in every. way. 
Special concessions in tuition fees are made to students from 
Tennessee.
-P-A-G-E-374
— 361 — 
In connection with the College of Medicine there is operated 
a School of Pharmacy. This subject was formerly taught at 
Knoxville. It has, however, been discontinued there and the 
pharmacy equipment has been transferred to Memphis, where 
a strong course in the subject has been planned. 
» COLLEGE OF DENTISTRY. 
The oldest dental school in the Southwest is the one operated 
by the University of Tennessee. For many years it did excel- 
lent work at Nashville, where it was originally established. 
With the removal of the medical school of the University from 
Nashville t0 Memphis, it was thought best to transfer the dental 
school also. Arrangements were therefore made to absorb 
the College of Dental Surgery of the University of Memphis. , 
The result of the. transfer and combination is the College of 
-Dentistry of the University of Tennessee. It has the combined 
equipments of the two schools and will be conducted in the new 
laboratory building just erected adjoining the College of Medi- 
cine. The college is a member of the National Association of 
Dental Faculties and has the standard requirements and course 
of that organization. : 
SuMMER SCHOOL OF THE SOUTH. 
For ten years there has been operated at the University, at 
Knoxville, the Summer School of the South. While assisting 
it in every way possible, the Trustees of the University did not 
see fit to take actual charge of the operations of the school until 
November, 1911. Plans for the taking charge of the school were 
under consideration when our then Professor of Education, 
Professor Claxton, who had managed the school¥from its begin- 
ning, was appointed to the position of United States Commis- 
sioner of Education. This fact made the assumption of control 
by the trustees imperative. In accordance with their instruc- 
tions I submitted a plan for the operation of the school as a 
department of the University, which plan was approved by them: 
Accordingly, the school was so conducted by them during the 
past summer. - The session was generally pronounced to be the 
most successful in its history. The school will be continued
-P-A-G-E-375
i— 862 — 
‘along similar lines in the future. While retaining all the cardinal 
features that have been characteristic of it in the past, a large 
opportunity will be given to teachers and others to secure regu- 
lar college credit for work done, such credit counting toward 
degrees at this University and elsewhere. The attendance in 
1912 reached the large total of 2406. It is believed that plans 
now being made will increase this number in, future sessions. 
THE EXPERIMENT STATIONS. 
The work of the agricultural experiment stations of the 
University at Knoxville and at Jackson, and of the co-operative 
experiments in agriculture at many points in Middle Tennessee 
has continued along the general lines heretofore reported and 
which are well known. Great good has come from the work of 
these stations. They are a part of a system of such stations 
subsidized by the National Government and covering the whole 
country. The combined influence has been to revolutionize 
farming in all its branches. 
EXTENSION WoRK OF THE UNIVERSITY. 
During the winter of 1910-11, agricultural short courses 
were held at Knoxville, Fayetteville, Jackson and’ Cleveland. 
These courses were supported partly by the University and partly 
by private subscription. No State funds were available for 
this work, a fact greatly to be regretted. The agricultural 
professors did what they could with their limited means. This 
very important work should be liberally provided for by the 
State, as is now the case in most other progressive common- 
wealths. For the winter of 1912, short courses are being planned 
for McMinnville, Columbia, Clarksville, Brunswick, Jackson, 
Paris, Livingston, Sevierville and Knoxville. In most of these 
places voluntary subscriptions have been made for the ordinary 
expenses of the courses. The University contributes the serv- 
ices of the teachers, and the animals and equipment used in 
demonstrations, while the railroads have been generous in fur- 
nishing transportation for men and equipment. If by these 
courses, given under difficulties and restrictions, such large in- 
terest and valuable results are obtained, how can one measure
-P-A-G-E-376
— 363 — 
the benefits that would follow a scheme of this kind well sup- 
ported by the State, and carried out by a corps of skilled special- 
ists giving their whole time to the work? Let. us hope that wise 
counsels in this matter will prevail and that suitable provision 
will be made for placing this work on a permanent basis. 
In conclusion I beg to call attention to the many and radical 
advances in the University in recent years. In all its depart- 
ments it has made progress not excelled by any of the Southern 
institutions and stands in the very front rank. Its standards 
are now those generally approved in the best institutions of the . 
land. We have striven for years to reach this goal, under the 
belief that the best is none too good for our beloved Volunteer 
State.

TENNESSEE INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL. 
Hon. J. W. Brister, Superintendent Public Instruction, State of 
Tennessee. 
Dear Sir: In response to your request, I take pleasure in 
submitting herewith a report of the organization and work of 
the Tennessee Industrial School from December 20, 1910, to 
December 19, 1911, our last fiscal year. . 
White and colored pupils of both sexes are received and oc- 
cupy departments separate and distinct from each other to meet 
the requirements of the statutes of the State. The children are 
about equally divided in number in the literary and industrial 
departments. The employment of this system makes possible 
the constant operation of both branches during the entire school 
day. In the school of letters good work has been done, and with 
few exceptions the pupils have shown satisfactory progress. 
In the shops the-work has been up to the standard and there is 
abundant evidence of the realization of gratifying results. As 
heretofore, the pupils, in addition to their literary studies, ex- 
tending through those found in the curricula of high schools, 
have been engaged in the following trades and industries: 
Architectural and mechanical drawing, bread making, bar- 
bering, broom making, blacksmithing, bookkeeping, cabinet 
making, carpentry, care of steam boilers, cooking, dress making 
and embroidery, electrical work, farming, floriculture, harness 
and shoe making and repairing, mattress and quilt making, 
painting, printing, steam laundering, storekeeping, shorthand 
and typewriting, telegraphy, tailoring, vegetable gardening, 
wood carving, work in machine shop, work in hot beds and cold 
frames, work in barn and care of stock. : 
The music classes are well arranged and continue to be con- 
ducted on the same high plane of efficiency. The military band 
still enjoys the reputation of being one of the best boy musical . 
organizations in the country. The pupils are not permitted to 
allow the study of this art to interfere with their work in the in- 
dustrial and commercial departments. 
All the brooms and bedding used by the institution have been 
manufactured by the children. Most of the clothing, furniture, 
ice, and many of the shoes have been made by them. They have 
also done a great deal of the printing, painting, carpentering and
-P-A-G-E-383
— 370— . 
other repair work. The conduct of our farm and dairy has proven 
fairly productive and profitable. 
As a whole the health of the pupils has been exceedingly good. 
We feel a peculiar pride in the low rate of our mortality, in view 
of the fact that a number of the children who come to us are in a 
depleted physical condition, due to previous exposure, priva- 
tion, and erroneous modes of living, thus possessing insufficient 
resisting power to repel the attacks of disease. A general medical 
practitioner is employed to examine all children received and to 
care for the sick. An employed dentist spends two days of the 
week in looking after the health and protection of the pupils’ 
teeth. The hospital facilities and appointments are adequate, 
comfortable and modern and are in the charge of skilled and 
faithful nurses. 
The general deportment of the pupils has afforded no ground 
for complaint. Indeed, it deserves, as a whole, the most favor- 
able commendation. The morale of the institution constantly 
tend upward. The management has endeavored wherever 
practicable to quietly draw down upon the pupils’ past the cur- 
tain of oblivion, and has with earnestness attempted to unfetter 
them from the bonds of diseased heredity and remembrances of 
corruptive environments and associations. To achieve these 
ends, careful, positive but kindly tempered discipline has been 
employed, the health of the child given proper attention, whole- 
" some amusements provided, and the exertion of ail efforts on the 
part of the management to make the institution homelike and 
the stay of the pupils as pleasurable as possible without compro- 
mising the welfare of the children or defeating the purpese for 
which they were entrusted to us. It is my pleasure to state that 
in the majority.of cases results of residence here have been im- 
mediate and visible. 
The children committed to our care are usually those upon 
whom all remedies have been exhausted with. peor results, and 
many constitute situations, to which nearly every form of human 
‘ error has contributed. By administering the discipline carefully 
and suggestively, an attitude is engendered that quickly ‘disa- 
buses the pupil’s mind of the idea that he possesses inherited 
rights to destroy his future and that of others interested. The 
pupils are made to truly feel and understand that their presence 
in the institution signifies another chance and a new environ-
-P-A-G-E-384
* — 371— 
ment. This feeling on their part will cause them to regard with 
reason and justice the restrictions imposed upon them, and with 
few exceptions results in their readily accepting the discipline 
subjected to as merited, no matter how distasteful some of its 
features may appear at first. The most potentially dangerous 
youth to society is the boy or girl who is frequently described 
by the parents as one led into wrong doing by others, for the 
reason this child can be prevailed upon to perform many desper- 
ate acts, which the so-called leaders’ judgment and conception 
of punishment would prevent him from doing. 
It has never been the-intention of the management to make 
the institution self-sustaining or a money-making investment 
for the State. On the other hand, it has been the steadfast aim 
to use the entire income for the proper rearing and education of 
the children, none of whom has ever left the school who has not 
been able to feel and understand that he had left a home to whose 
door he held the key, and to which he could return should ad- 
versity besiege him. This privilege has been availed of by them 
many times, and their futures given needed protection. It is” 
the particular desire and province of the school to assist and 
honor the homeless boy or girl who has been made the victim 
of circumstances over which he exercised no control and has 
thereby been denied such educational opportunities as to enable 
him to successfully compete with the child of favorable circum- 
stances. Many unfortunate children of this class have been 
thus placed with us and have happily become the beneficiaries 
of such training and instruction as has enabled them not only to 
earn an honest livelihood, but to also satisfy such laudable 
ambitions for the higher branches of education as they enter- 
tained. 
In order to meet effectually the necessities of the morally 
weak, mentally retarded and physically deficient, it requires 
tactful, just and sympathetical application of wise preventive 
agencies, intelligent corrective treatment, and proper knowledge 
of vocational standards. To properly diagnose a case for treat- 
ment it is absolutely necessary in a large number of cases that 
scientific study be given past environment, early training, heredi- 
tary equipment, ancestral history, capacity for vocational train- 
ing, and other causativé factors responsible for the childhood 
‘not being normal. Nothing can contribute so much to this end
-P-A-G-E-385

_ as a mutual understanding, a common attitude, and a cheerful 
co-operation of the agencies working toward the realization of 
the same principles, standards and ideals. This, we must pain- 
fully admit, cannot be accomplished in a short period of time. 
It might also be well to remember that the preservation of such 
method cannot be maintained without occasional contention and 
conflict, as such fine spirit will need a harder and deeper founda- 
tion than complaisance and compromise. The price of success 
in this endeavor is invariably self-denial, hard work, hope, and 
courage. From this common understanding and co-operation 
a system would be inevitably evolved that would materially 
check the rapid increase of our burdens, resultant from the 
death, invalidism and moral and mental breakdown of parents; 
bad hereditary tendencies and exposure of childhood to immoral 
and unfortunate social and industrial conditions; as it would 
then be possible to reach the affected child with reconstructive 
power of personal influence, and determined appeal to the inner 
moral nature, during its susceptible years. 
We have received from all sources since the opening of the 
institution, December 15, 1886, to December 19, 1911, six 
thousand and seven (6,007) pupils. Of this number four thou- 
sand six hundred and seventy-four (4,674) were white boys, one 
thousand and fifty (1,050) white girls, two hundred and fifty-six 
(256) colored boys, and twenty-seven (27) colored girls. During 
this same period of time there has been dismissed five thousand, 
two hundred and thirty-four (5,234) pupils, of whom four thou- 
sand one hundred and eight (4,108) were white boys, eight hun- 
dred and fifty-six (856) white girls, two hundred and fifty-one 
(251) colored boys, and nineteen (19) colored girls. Remaining 
in school on December 19, 1911, there were seven hundred and 
seventy-three (773) pupils, of which number five hundred and 
sixty-six (566) were white boys, and one hundred and ninety- 
four (194) white girls, five (5) colored boys, and eight (8) colored 
girls, who were being paid for as follows:

(796) pupils. During the past fiscal year beginning on Decem- 
ber 20, 1910, and ending December 19, 1911, we have received 
three hundred and sixteen (316) pupils, of which number two 
hundred and forty-nine (249) were white boys, fifty-six (56) 
white girls, four (4) colored boys, and seven (7) colored girls, and 
dismissed during the same period three hundred and thirty- 
nine (339) pupils, among whom were two hundred and fifty-one 
(251) white boys, sixty-four (64) white girls, nineteen (19) colored 
boys, and five (5) colored girls. Of the number admitted, one 
hundred and twenty (120) were committed by the several county 
courts of Tennessee to be maintained at the expense of the 
State, fifty-one (51) committed at the expense of the counties 
committing them, and one hundred and forty-five (145) placed 
in our care as private pay wards, to be paid for by parents, 
guardians and friends interested. 
We received from the last General Assembly of Tennessee in 
recognition of our imperative needs in the way of funds for ex- 
traordinary repairs and the erection of buildings to meet our ne- 
cessities, $19,000.00. Of this amount $4,000.00 is being used 
for the repair and extension of the steam heating system which 
had become very defective, and with the $15,000.00 we are erect- 
ing, adjoining the main boys’ department, a building in which 
will be located a division school room and dormitory, a central 
dining-room for the boys, kitchens for the main boys’ depart- 
ment, and a bakery. We had hoped to be able to use a part of 
this building for a central school room for the larger boys, but 
lack of dormitory space compelled us to make other arrange- 
ments. There is also in process of erection an ice storage plant,
-P-A-G-E-387
— 374 — 
in which we are also placing several hundred feet of pipe coils for 
cooling the drinking water. This arrangement will not only be 
perfectly sanitary, but by its convenience will relieve a long-felt 
want, and obviously reduce a great deal of labor. In addition, 
a great deal of repair work has been done, involving an outlay 
of several thousand dollars, which has been paid out of our per 
capita or living expenses. The pupils did a material part of the 
work, and had this not been the case, this amount would have 
been considerably larger. 
The management would be pleased if every citizen of Ten- 
nessee, who can conveniently do so, would avail himself of the 
opportunity of visiting the school and become acquainted with 
the methods employed and the results that are being realized. 
It is a regretable fact, indeed, that many of our intelligent and 
enlightened citizens have so little real knowledge of the scope 
and character of the work that is being done here for the home- 
less, dependent and waywardly inclined children of the State. 
The school is open to visitors on every day except Sunday. 
Among the number of visitors who have inspected our plant : 
during the past year were many men and women who are thor- 
oughly conversant with all the details of institutional life and 
some are actively identified in an official way with effective or- 
ganizations and associations engaged in the problem of child 
saving. They were greatly impressed with the specimens of 
the pupils’ work examined and especially with the enthusiasm, 
happiness, and quiet, peaceable spirit, which they observed in 
the eight hundred children under our care. They. pronounced 
the work here as comparing most favorably with the best schools 
of its kind that it has been their pleasure to visit. It has also 
been our pleasing privilege to hear many of those who have not 
been in sympathy with institutions and labored under the belief 
that the arrangements provided therein were unadvised and re- 
sulting in little more, if any, than a useless expenditure of money 
and effort, to express themselves, after inspecting our depart- 
ments and acquainting themselves with the results that were 
being achieved, that it was their belief that institutions of this 
kind constituted the ideal way for the State or nation to develop 
and provide and care for its unfortunate and erring young. 
Very respectfully, 
W. C. KILVINGTON, Superintendent.

TENNESSEE DEAF AND DUMB SCHOOL. 
Hon. J. W. Brister, State Superintendent Public Instruction, Nash- 
ville, Tennessee: 
Sr: I herewith submit financial statement for biennial period 
ending July 1, 1912. 
In connection with. this report I beg to say that during the 
period under consideration we have had pupils from most of the 
counties of Tennessee in attendance, which has averaged 250. 
Our school consists of two departments, one for white children, 
situated in Knoxville, on a plot of eight acres, with commodious 
buildings, good equipment, etc., and a colored department two 
miles from the city, in connection with which a dairy farm is 
maintained. 
Our school is conducted under. what is known as the combined 
system, part of the pupils being taught by oral methods, consist- . 
ing of speech, speech-reading and writing and the remainder by 
manual methods, under which the manual alphabet and writing 
are largely employed. 
The health of the school has been quite good during the period 
under consideration, but one pupil having been lost by death 
during that time. 
The effort of the school is to give all pupils a good education 
in the common. school English branches, and. to train them in 
some industrial pursuit by which they may be able to earn a 
living when they shall have gone out into the world to earn their 
own way. — 
There are probably deaf children throughout the State in 
the counties from which we have no representatives, who should 
be in school, and of whom we have no definite knowledge. The 
public school teachers of the State could render signal service to 
such children and to their respective communities by putting 
the school authorities into communication with the friends of 
such children.,

REPORT OF THE SCHOOL OF THE BLIND 
Hon. J. W. Brister, State Superintendent Public Instruction, Nash- 
ville, Tennessee. 
Dear Sir: I have the honor to'submit for your considera- 
tion my report of the Tennessee School for the Blind for the 
sessions 1910-11 and 1911-12. 
The enrollment for the session 1910-11 was two hundred and 
thirty-two; for 1911-12, two hundred and eighteen. 
The health of the school has been unusually good, no disease 
of a serious nature making its appearance. Eyes of pupils were 
examined and a number placed under treatment. Twenty- 
seven operations were performed. Many were relieved of pain 
and discomfort and the vision of others greatly improved. 
The progress of the school in its several departments has been 
excellent. 
The problem of educating our pupils so they will be producers 
and not parasites, so they will be useful and not ornamental only, 
so they will be independent and not dependent, so they will 
return to a generous State worthy citizenship, so they will be 
happy and useful people, is indeed a problem. Our effort is 
to give them that life in school that will fit them to continue to 
live when they leave us. 
In the literary department, regular quarterly examinations 
were held, and each showed steady improvement. 
All pupils who enter school are given an opportunity to study 
music, and instruction on piano, pipe organ and in voice is 
given. All pupils receive chorus training. Music not only 
trains the mind and artistic sense but is the best means by which 
the blind can earn a living. In this they can more successfully 
compete with the seeing than in any other work. 
Pupils have derived much benefit from instruction in ex- 
pression, and the systematic gymnasium training received has 
had splendid effect on mind and morals. ~ 
Monthly recitals, consisting of piano and. organ numbers, 
songs and readings quickened the interest of pupils and placed 
the work of each teacher in contrast with every other teacher,
-P-A-G-E-403
—— 388 — 
thus the work of teachers and pupils was under inspection each 
month. The teacher of boys’ gymnasium occasionally gave ex- 
hibitions of the work in his department. I find these monthly 
recitals very beneficial‘and instructive. 
The atmosphere of every school should be to inspire the pupils 
to love work, to be workers and to be useful. The vocational 
atmosphere of every school, should extend far enough to make 
every child know that busy hands make happy hearts and that 
the faithful, efficient work of head and hand brings success and 
happiness. Therefore every pupil who enters school is required 
to. spend one or more hours each day in the work shop, sewing 
room, and in bead and fancy work. The boys are taught to 
make brooms, mops, mattresses and hammocks, to cane chairs 
and to tune.and repair pianos and reed organs. The girls learn 
to cut and to sew, both by hand and on machine, to knit, crochet 
and to fashion articles of bead and raffia. 
For the two terms we have given grammar school certificates 
to four pupils and fourteen high school diplomas were presented. 
Eight medals were awarded for proficiency in music, two for 
voice, one for expression and three for general excellence. 
As the blind, more than any other people, are thrown upon 
their own resources for personal entertainment and pleasure, and 
asso many of their lonely hours will be spent in foolish fancies or 
vain, . miserable brooding, we endeavor from the very start to 
inculcate a fondness for reading, a love and a reverence for 
books. The advanced pupils are taught to’ understand and 
appreciate the great writers and thinkers of the past and also 
the present, for there are no better companions than good books 
_and no better friends'and comforters than the great and wise 
who have given us their best thoughts and have told us of their 
trials, their defeats and their triumphs. He who trains his mind 
to contemplate lofty themes, to find pleasure in the company of 
philosophers and sages occupies a position unassailable by the 
petty cares and annoyances of every day life. - : 
In 1879 Congress set apart $250,000, the interest.on which 
was to’ be used for printing books for the blind of this country. 
This amount was to be divided among the various state schools, 
according to the number of pupils in each. By. this generosity 
we have accumulated a considerable number of books, about
-P-A-G-E-404
— 389 — 
five thousand volumes. As Congress a few years ago allowed 
embossed books to pass through the mail free, the school library 
is now a circulating library for the blind of Tennessee. In the 
United States there are one hundred and fifty thousand volumes 
in tangible print distributed among forty-four schools and ten 
special libraries. All these lend books to the blind when appli- 
cation is made. The National Printing House for the Blind is 
in Louisville, Kentucky. Authorized expenditure for printing 
is eleven thousand dollars per annum, and by donation and be- 
quests from five to ten thousand dollars per annum. There are 
twenty independent presses in various parts of the country busy 
printing excellent books which are sold to schools and individuals 
at what they really cost. 
Respectfully submitted, 
J. V. ARMSTRONG, 
Superintendent.

REPORT OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL INSPECTOR. 
Hon. J. W. Brister, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville; Tennessee. 
Sir: I have the honor to submit herewith my third annual 
report as Elementary School Inspector for the scholastic year 
ending June 30, 1912. - 
My work of assisting in the development of the rural elemen- 
tary schools of the State has been done through co-operation with 
county superintendents of schools, county boards of education, 
county courts, and directly with public school teachets and citi- 
zens. ‘In many instances it has been necessary for me to spend 
a week or two driving over a county in company with the county 
superintendent inspecting the elementary schools, as to the 
building, ‘location, equipment, teachers, etc., or perhaps con- 
ducting a county campaign with a view to securing an increased 
school tax, bond issue for schools or perhaps consolidation of the 
weak, inefficient one-teacher schools into centralized ones. In 
these campaigns we have been assisted by county board members, 
members county courts and leading citizens who are interested 
in the betterment of the elementary schools. No campaign 
has been conducted without a definite purpose in view, and after 
the campaign has closed a map of the county is made on which 
is shown the location of every school in the county, together 
with a description of it, consisting of the number in attendance, 
number of teachers, the distance from adjoining schools, etc. 
The county board of education is then called together and the 
facts about the schools gathered in our study is laid before them 
and suggestions for improving them are then made. In the work — 
of making maps of counties our task has been greatly lightened 
by securing from the National Postoffice Department about 
twenty maps of counties in Tennessee. These maps show the 
location of each school, distances, etc. When consolidation is 
needed we show on the map the proper location for the central 
consolidated school, together with the proposed routes for 
transportation wagons.
-P-A-G-E-411
—~ 394 — 
When a complete study of the county has been made and the 
locations for consolidated schools have been agreed upon, it is 
then decided as to which locality shall be worked first. In 
selecting this locality many things are considered; usually that 
locality is chosen which offers the best opportunity for working 
the consolidation, such as the attitude of the people and the 
effect it will have upon the rest of the county. It has been our 
experience that while there usually develops considerable oppo- 
sition to consolidation at first, yet, if one first-class consoli- 
dated school can be established in a county many others will 
follow the example set and the work afterwards is much simpli- 
fied: When once the many advantages of a consolidated school 
are established before the people they are anxious to try the ex- 
periment themselves. 
It may be that my visit to a county will be for the purpose 
of addressing the county court urging an increased school tax or 
a bond issue for building school houses. Where a county super- 
intendent has previously agitated these questions and had the 
members of the county court studying them beforehand, these 
visits are frequently successful. The county superintendent, 
however, must have first brought the needs of his county before 
the court before he can expect immediate results from an address 
by a visitor from outside the county. It is sometimes necessary 
that several addresses be made before county courts to secure the 
action asked for. 
A large number of my visits to counties are for the purpose 
of addressing county teachers’ associations on the work of the 
rural elementary school. I am frequently called upon to explain 
the work as outlined in the State course of study for elementary 
schools and to assist teachers in the proper grading of their 
schools. . 
Having the entire State as a field it is impossible to visit all 
communities or even to answer all calls made by superintend- 
ents. Perhaps four-fifths of my time has been occupied with 
field work. During the year I have traveled 19,729 miles by 
rail, approximately 2,423 miles by buggy and horseback. . 
During the year I have visited fifty-one counties of the State, 
having previously visited ninety-two. In some of these I have 
spent from one to two weeks and visited all from one to two days.
-P-A-G-E-412
— 395 — 
To some it has been necessary to return several times, and to a 
number it has been necessary to return from three to four times: 
What time I have not been in the field it has been necessary 
to be in the office to assist (1) in the revision of the State course 
of study for elementary schools, one thousand copies of which 
were printed and sent out to the different counties. A second 
edition of this was recently printed and sent out, the first edition 
having been exhausted; (2) in the collection of data and the 
preparation of a Bulletin of more than one hundred pages on 
. The Rural School Situation in Tennessee Regarding Consolidation 
of Schools and Transportation of Pupils. It was necessary to 
collect and arrange much tabular matter for the Bulletin and 
this was obtained from county superintendents by means of 
reports. In addition to these we have from time to time sent 
out circulars of information to county superintendents and in 
many instances direct to teachers themselves for the purpose of 
collecting information regarding their work, and as to the con- 
dition of the rural schools. 
CONSOLIDATION OF SCHOOLS. 
One of the main features of my work during the year has been 
assisting in the consolidation of the one-room schools. Realizing 
that efficient work cannot be done in this type of school as it, 
now exists, it has been our policy to urge its abandonment as 
fast as possible and wherever an opportunity to assist in this 
work has appeared it has been encouraged and assisted, with the 
result that many one-room schools have been abandoned and 
central, consolidated schools established. This work has been 
greatly stimulated by the Bulletin issued by the State Depart- 
ment of Education on this subject. County superintendegts 
and boards of education are becoming more interested in it than 
ever before, and thoughtful citizens everywhere are urging it. 
During: the year one hundred and eight one-teacher schools 
were abandoned and forty schools with two or more teachers 
established to take their places. One hundred and eighty-four 
new school houses were erected during the year at a cost of $359,- 
021.14, or at an average cost of practically $2,000.00 each. 
Besides work in many other counties special campaigns for 
the purpose of urging consolidation of schools were conducted in 
*
-P-A-G-E-413
— 396 — 
three counties of the State, to-wit: Washington County in East 
Tennessee, Coffee County in Middle Tennessee arid Weakley 
County in West Tennessee. Two weeks were spent in each 
county and from one to three. public school mass meetings were 
held daily for the purpose of calling attention to the great need 
,for better rural schools. Much interest was developed by these 
meetings and much local aid was offered to assist the county board 
of education in the éstablishment of first-class rural schools. 
One community in Washington County offered $2,450 cask and 
ten acres of ground to the county board, provided they would . 
consolidate three schools in their community and build a central 
school. Other communities are now following the example set 
by this one and the county superintendent is planning the consoli- 
dation of many more one-room schools in that county this fall. 
Meetings are still being held in that county. : 
Coffee County was canvassed for two weeks, meetings being 
held night and day, with the result that several communities 
- offered to supplement by one-half the amount necessary. to erect 
central consolidated schools. Coffee County, however, is not 
under the County Board Law as applies to most other counties 
of the State and some difficulty was met in the county board. 
On account of its size it was difficult to get the co-operation of 
all the members. The work of abandoning the one-room school 
‘has been going on to some extent, however, the county superin- 
tendent only recently having reported four abandoned. 
In Weakley County the mass meetings have resulted in much 
good. A number of schools have been abandoned and only re- 
cently the county superintendent reports éwo school wagons hav- 
ing been put in operation carrying the children from abandoned 
school communities. And the work has only begun there. 
The example of the school wagons on the road and the increased 
efficiency of the consolidated schools has succeeded in arousing 
the interest of other communities and the county superintendent 
reports that many other communities are already petitioning for 
the school wagon and the consolidated schools. . 
In all of these counties after a study of the county as a whole, 
maps were made locating the schools, giving the number of chil- 
dren belonging to each and the distance from surrounding schools, 
etc. A study of the public roads, streams and mountians and
-P-A-G-E-414
— 397 — 
their influence upon the public school situation was made. 
This information was prepared not only for the benefit of our- 
selves in the work which we were doing, but for the benefit of 
the county boards of education and others interested in the de- 
velopment of the public school interests of the county. Besides 
in these counties, consolidation of schools has been urged in 
many others. Sevier County has mine one-teacher schools to . 
report'as having been recently abandoned, Lincoln County has 
jive, and Knox, Maury, Warren, Davidson, have four each. In 
all one hundred and forty-eight have been abandoned during the 
year, 
‘+ TRANSPORTATION OF PUPILS. 
The proper consolidation of schools necessitates the use of 
transportation of pupils by means of public conveyance. “Other 
states have long ago adopted this method of building up efficient 
tural schools, but Tennessee has been somewhat slow to take 
up the problem of conveyance. It is now perfectly clear that 
this method must be adopted in order to obtain the best results 
in the consolidated schools. Without it many children are too | 
far from the school to reach it in time for opening by walking, 
and usually the rural districts are so sparsely settled that in 
order to enroll a very large number of children in one school it 
is necessary to let the school serve an area of from fifteen to 
twenty-five square miles. Under these circumstances, transpor- 
tation becomes a necessity. 
There are now 26 public school wagons in use in five counties 
of the State, three counties having adopted the method this fall. 
These 26 wagons haul daily 667 children to consolidated schools, 
a distance of, approximately, five miles. Shelby County is the 
pioneer in the transportation of school children and is closely 
followed by Madison. Weakley, Humphreys, and Rhea coun- 
ties have only this season adopted the system. Many other 
counties are preparing to follow the example of these as soon as 
better public roads are secured. 
County SUPERVISION. 
The most important school official in a county is'the county 
superintendent of schools. On him is dependent the mapping
-P-A-G-E-415
= 898 — 
out of the school policies of the county and the organization of 
the work. It is a physical impossibility for most of thé county 
superintendents in Tennessee to properly supervise the schools 
of his county. Since the County Board Law went into effect the 
clerical work of the county superintendent has been practically 
doubled and he has less time now for visiting and supervision 
work than he had before the passage of this law. Statistics for 
the past year show that the average amount of time given during 
the year to supervising each school in the county was two hours. 
He can only visit each school once or twice while it is in session, 
and on account of the brief period of his visit he is unable to 
supervise the work of his teachers except in a general way. 
SPECIAL SCHOOL SUPERVISORS. 
A few counties in Tennessee have recognized this condition 
and have taken the proper step to remedy it; that is, by the ap- 
pointment of special school supervisors for the rural school work. 
Such supervisors have for a long time been employed by school 
’ authorities in many other states and we believe within the near 
future many more will be employed in Tennessee. 
Madison County has employed a Supervisor of Agricultural 
- Work at a salary of $1,200.00 per year. ' His work consists of 
supervision work in all the county schools and the direction of 
agricultural experimental work on the school farms. 
Bradley County has appointed a Supervisor of Rural Schools, 
at a salary of $55.00 per month, whose headquarters are in the 
office of the county superintendent of schools and whose duty it 
is to visit all the schools of the county and assist in the organiza- 
tion of School Improvement Leagues, Tomato Clubs, etc. 
Davidson County has employed a Supervisor of Primary 
Work at a salary of $70.00 per month. She has supervision of 
the primary work in the entire county, visits the teachers in 
their schools and lends them what assistance she can and gives 
monthly talks at the teachers’ meetings on the primary work in 
the rural schools. 
Knox County has appointed a Supervisor of Agriculture at a 
salary of $1,800.00 per year. He is to have charge of the agri- 
cultural teaching in all of the county schools. His duty is to
-P-A-G-E-416
— 399 — 
visit the schools from time to time and assist the teachers in 
their work in agriculture. Mr. Phillips, the supervisor employed, 
is a graduate of Cornell University. 
Shelby County has made provision for the employment of a 
Special Supervisor of Primary Work, but the appointment has 
not yet been made. 
The State Department of Education is urging that every 
county in the State employ special supervisors, and many of 
them are now planning todo so. Closer supervision of the coun- 
try schools means better organization in the work and conse- 
quently more efficient schools. Perhaps no better step could 
now be taken for the benefit of our rural schools than the employ- 
ment of special supervisors in all of the counties of the State. 
ScHOOL IMPROVEMENT LEAGUES AND CLuR Work. 
An important factor in adapting the work of the rural school 
to its surroundings is the work being done by the School Improve- 
ment Leagues and Girls’ Canning and Poultry Clubs. These 
organizations are assisting in the work of linking the school with 
the home and thereby making the school more interesting. 
During the past year this work, in charge of Miss Virginia P. 
Moore, has made splendid progress, the School Improvement _ 
Leagues now numbering 2,000 in the State, with 10,000 members; 
of the Girls’ Canning and Poultry Clubs there are 38, with a 
membership of 800. Many counties have strong Boys’ Corn 
Clubs, which have regular meetings and which are causing 
much increased interest to be taken in the school. These, to- 
gether with the school fairs which some counties have recently 
begun holding, in which the work of the different school and com- 
munity. clubs is exhibited, means much for the wider use of the 
school. 
CourRsE oF STUDY. 
In my previous published report, found in the biennial report 
from the State Department of Education for the year ending 
June 30, 1910, I called special attention to the preparation of 
the Course of Study for Elementary Schools which had been is- 
sued during the year, and a sufficient supply furnished each 
county superintendent in the State with which to supply all of
-P-A-G-E-417
~~ 400 — 
the teachers of elementary schools in the county. The work 
there described of supplying county superintendents with this 
course of study by the State has been continued each year since 
1910. Each year the course has been revised wherever it was 
possible to improve it and still make it of general use throughout 
the State, in the more prosperous as well as in the weaker counties 
of the State. 
The latest revision consisted in the addition of considerable 
work in Literature in the Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Grades. It is 
suggested in these grades that the work in literature be divided 
into class study and memorization work. Under each head is 
given selections which were selected with much care, and which 
we believe are resulting in much good in the school work. Teach- 
ers report using it with splendid results. 
CoursE IN GENERAL USE. 
That the course of study is now in general use in all of the 
counties of the State is evidenced by the great demand for it 
by county superintendents, and directly, in many instances, by 
teachers. Almost every mail brings a request either from a 
county superintendent for a supply for all of his teachers, or 
from individual teachers requesting a copy of the course of study. 
So great has been the demand that a second edition was required 
after the first edition this year of ten thousand copies had been 
exhausted. It is out hope to have a copy of the State course of 
study in every elementary school in the State; to have its sug- 
gestions closely followed by the teachers; to have it discussed 
in teachers’ meetings, and to have it explained and discussed 
from time to time by superintendents and other school officers, 
to the end. that its use may result in a better gradation of our 
rural elementary schools and a consequent better type of work. 
CompuLsory ATTENDANCE Laws. 
Although it has been urged before the Legislature a number of 
times, a compulsory attendance law for the State as a whole 
has never been passed. However, the following counties have 
secured the passage of special laws:
-P-A-G-E-418

Marion, Hardin, 
- Scott, Jefferson, 
Smith, Johnson, 
Union. 
In most counties the laws have had a most beneficial effect. 
In some of them the increased attendance did not last but for 
a year or so until it was evident that the law would not be en- 
forced. In fact, this seems to be the trouble in most of the coun- 
ties that have these laws. To enforce such laws successfully a 
special officer for the purpose is needed. 
ScHooL, REVENUES. 
1. Bond issues for public school buildings. 
One of the most beneficial acts of the last legislature affecting 
the public schools was an enabling act, giving to counties in 
the State, the right, by a majority vote of the county court, to 
issue bonds for the purpose of building and equipping school houses. 
Heretofore when counties built school houses the money was taken 
from the current school fund and resulted of course, in the short- 
ening of the school term. Under this general act the funds for 
this purpose may be raised without ‘affecting the term. In the 
future we hope to see counties following the example of progressive 
cities and issue bonds for building purposes. 
Bond issues are being agitated now in a number of counties 
in each division of the State, and prospects are bright for a few 
courts to take favorable action at the coming January term of 
the court.
-P-A-G-E-419
—— 402 — 
Lewis County, one of the small, weak counties of the State, 
has already voted $10,000.00 for school buildings under authority 
. granted by this act, it being the first county in the State to take 
such action. While this bond issue is small, yet, when the ability 
of the county is considered, it means a great step for. Lewis 
County. 
It is the plan to consolidate a number of the one-room rural 
schools in Lewis County, and to this end the county superin- 
tendent, County Board of Education and myself have already 
held some preliminary meetings. We are now at work on a map 
of the county, and the work of consolidation will be approached 
from the standpoint of the county as a whole. - The location of 
the schools as they now stand will be shown and a description of 
each given. The most available locations for the consolidated 
. Schools will then be selected, and the work begun in earnest. 
Bonp Issues CoNnTINUED. 
In addition to the enabling act permitting counties in the 
the state to issue bonds for public school purposes, the fol- 
lowing counties secured the passage of special bonding acts, 
and have issued bonds in the following amounts:

ScHoLastic PopULATION, ENROLLMENT AND ATTENDANCE. 
The scholastic population for the rural districts of the State 
has decreased 3,492. While this is so, the scholastic population 
in the cities of the State has increased 4,795. For some time there 
has been an exodus of country people from the rural districts 
into the cities. It cannot be claimed, of course, that the country 
school is responsible for this exodus, yet at the same time it is 
evident to one who is acquainted with the educational conditions 
in the rural communities that the inefficiency of the present one- 
room rural school is to some extent, at least, to blame. It can 
be frequently heard by one travelling in the country that a cer-
-P-A-G-E-421
— 404 — 
tain intelligent farmer has moved, or is going to move, to town 
in order to educate his children. In fact, farmers do frequently 
move away from the country for no other reason than that they 
cannot have the proper educational advantages there for their 
families. They will give as their excuse the short terms, inef- 
ficient teachers and the inability of the rural schools to give their 
children the proper kind of education. : 
The rural school of the one-teacher type cannot give that 
broad educational training which will fit the country child for 
life in the country. It is more fit if possible for city children. 
The country child should be trained in the country school for 
the life it is going to live—for life on the farm. To this end it 
should be taught agriculture and every rural school should have 
a small farm of a few acres on which to conduct agricultural 
experimental work; it should be equipped with.a model kitchen 
and the girls should be taught domestic science. Community 
studies should be given and the child be trained to know some- 
thing about farm life. When we prepare the rural school to do 
this kind of work we have gone far, it seems to me, toward keeping 
the country child on the farm. 
This broader work of the rural school can be done only in the 
centralized consolidated school. Only by bringing together a 
larger number of the children in the rural districts can the rural 
school be made to do for the country what it ought to. The 
small school should be abolished and the children transported at 
public expense to the educational centers. This secures the 
enthusiasm of large numbers, consolidates the school funds and 
enables the boards of education to employ more efficient teachers 
at larger salaries. 
While the scholastic population in the rural districts has 
decreased, the children of school age who can read and write has 
inereased 16,174, which is very gratifying. 
- The enrollment has increased 39 and the daily attendance has 
increased 95. 
It is interesting also to note the enrollment in the grades 
of the elementary school. From the first grade to the fifth a 
decrease from 2,339 to 4,478 is shown, while from the sixth to the 
eighth an increase from 890 to 1,728 is shown. The attendance 
in the upper grades is increasing.
-P-A-G-E-422

The enrollment in each branch of study has increased to a 
considerable extent, with the exception of vocal music, which has 
decreased a small amount. 
While the length of school term has remained stationery, the 
monthly salary of teachers has increased $3.16 and the annual 
salary increased $46.00. The monthly cost of pupils’ tuition 
has increased 70 cents. 
One of the most gratifying indications in the report is in the 
number of pupils in the State completing the course of study for 
the elementary school which is, this year, 3,622, or 2,092 more 
than completed the course last year. 
County superintendents’ salaries averaged for the year 
$807.25. 
For the first time the finances of the rural elementary schools 
are given separately in this report, which shows a total receipt 
of $4,075,265.15. While this is to some extent approximated, 
it is practically correct. 
Statistics given in the following tables are the Rural Ele- 
mentary Schools and have been collected from reports direct to 
me and also to the State Superintendent of Public Instruction.

REPORT OF SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATIONS 
AND GIRLS’ CANNING AND POULTRY CLUBS. 
ScHOoL IMPROVEMENT. 
It is the purpose of the School Improvement Association to 
aid in the developement of active co-operation of parents and 
teachers, to improve the house and grounds by making them more 
healthful, comfortable, beautiful and attractive and to perform 
such other work as may be helpful to the school and civic life 
of the community. 
In many places the School Improvement Associations have 
supplemented the salary fund, purchased equipment of all 
kinds, including furnishings for auditoriums and laboratory 
equipment and supplies; installed drinking fountains and water 
coolers with individual drinking cups, built additional rooms, 
graded, beautified and equipped school grounds and introduced 
~ the custom of having lectures that will be an uplift to the com- 
munities; furnished books and clothing to needy children, served 
lunches at the midday meal, bought and equipped play grounds 
and furnished rest rooms for teachers; converted dilapidated 
schoolhouses into homelike places by removing cob-webs and 
dirt and applying paint, planting flowers, vines, and shrubbery, 
and establishing a library for the school and community. 
School Improvement Associations have been organized in 
nearly every county in the State—some counties having as many 
as forty-seven associations. It is estimated that there are about 
one thousand five hundred associations in the State, with a mem- 
bership of about sixty thousand. These extend from the rural 
mountain school to the cities. 
- A TypicaL REPORT. 
The following report will show the work of one association: 
SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION, CURVE, LAUDERDALE 
County, TENNESSEE. 
“When our present teacher came to Curve, Lauderdale 
County, two years ago, she found an old, dilapidated house, not
-P-A-G-E-435
— 416 — 
large enough for the pupils, situated in the center of a large field, 
with a path leading from the gate, a distance of about three 
hundred feet from the road. This path led through a field of 
_ corn, and was the only way to reach the school without crossing 
some growing crops. After reaching what was called the 
‘school ground’ it was necessary to wade through weeds so high 
the smaller children could hardly see over them. 
“The schoolhouse was a one-room frame structure, with a 
temporary partition built through the.center. A single door 
was in each end of the house. The windows, three on a side, 
were almost destitute of glass, with no curtains except a plank 
nailed on to keep out the rain. The desks were double, and most 
of them home-made with perpendicular backs, all the same size. 
There were two worn out coal stoves that had never been pol- 
ished. The floor was covered in coal soot and cinders and so 
open that children stepped through and bruised their feet and 
legs. 
“There were no steps, only an incline formed from ashes from 
the stove. The walls were covered with cowbebs and dust, 
with neither pictures nor maps. The teacher’s table had the 
appearance of one taken from an untidy kitchen, and her chair 
was an old fashioned one without the slats in the back. There 
were no out-buildings, no playground; in fact, nothing to woo 
children to this sacred place save the whistle of the wind and 
the songs of the birds. No wonder Curve school had an enroll- 
ment of only thirty-nine when the scholastic population was 
two hundred. . 
“On September 18, 1910, Mrs. Scott took her school to hear 
Prof. P. P, Claxton and Miss Virginia P. Moore on School Im- 
provement and on the following Friday organized a School Im- 
provement Association with twenty-one members, and to-day, 
by the hearty co-operation of pupils, patrons and teachers, she 
has turned this unsightly place into one of beauty. The old lot 
and house were sold and a new site, pretty and level, was pur- 
chased, on. which a new building was erected at a cost of $2,000. 
“Mrs. Scott gave several entertainments, raising the nice sum of 
$339.20, with which we built concrete walks in front of our new 
home, bought curtains for the windows, pictures, clock, maps, 
and a baseball outfit for the boys. We now have a good library,
-P-A-G-E-436
— 417 — 
as a result of the persistent efforts of teachers and pupils. The 
case is made of pine lumber secured from a lumber.shed in a near- 
by town, and was made by a fourteen year old pupil. The table 
on which it stands was made from the same kind of lumber by 
one of the patrons of the school. The books were sent in by 
the patrons and are all reference books. We have sixty dollars 
now on hand with which to buy books, and eighteen dollars to 
buy a new and better case. This money is deposited in our local 
“bank to be used for this purpose. The call bells, three in number, 
were presented to the teachers by our patrons, the large bell was 
given by the county. In addition to this we have paid our jani- 
tor $85. Two years ago we had one teacher and an enrollment 
the first month of thirty-nine pupils. This month we have en- 
rolled one hundred and sixty-nine pupils and have four teachers. 
“Last January Mrs. Scott organized a ‘Tomato Club,’ and 
every member of the club has made a splendid crop and will have 
an excellent report to make. In addition to this, our school 
entered a piano contest recently, and we were informed last 
week that we were successful. This will place in our school a 
splendid piano. /

The time of the State Organizer is continually in demand at 
county teachers’ meetings and organizing local school improve- 
ment associations and girls’ canning and poultry clubs. 
At the request of Capt. T. F. Peck, State Commissioner of 
Agriculture, I assisted in organizing the Home-makers’ Section 
of the Farmers’ Association in 1911. This organization will 
tend to enrich life for the woman on the farm. 
The sectional meetings of the county superintendents of edu- 
cation were addressed on specific lines of school improvement. 
These meetings were held at the State normals in the spring of 
1912. I also spoke to the Southern Commercial Congress, at 
the request of Hon. Duncan Fletcher. During the past summer 
fifteen county institutes were visited and the work inaugurated 
in these counties.. The presidents of the county associations 
report splendid progress. At the request: of the presidents, I _ 
addressed the student body at each of the State normals. on 
“School Improvement.” These normals are aiding in a splendid 
way in the work of school improvement by encouraging a study’ 
of methods for beautifying school buildings and grounds.

_ At the Inter-State School Improvement League, which met 
as a part of the Conference for Education in the South, we de- 
cided that bread clubs should be stressed by the School Improve- 
ment Association. Hamilton County has done a splendid work 
in organizing bread clubs. Mrs. Devine and Mrs. R. B. Cook, 
two School Improvement Association workers and public spirited 
women have led this work. More than two hundred attended 
one demonstration and the interest is extending into the rural 
homes through these girls. 
About ninety-séven thousand ($97,000) dollars has been 
raised and expended for school improvement the. past year 
through these associations. :

School Improvement Organizer. 
Grris’ CANNING AND PouLtRy CLurRs. 
On November 18, 1911, I was appointed by Mr. Bradford 
Knapp, of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, as State Or- 
ganizer of the Girls’ Canning and Poultry Club work in Tennessee 
in co-operation with the Southern Education Board, and State 
Department of Education. : 
My first work was to send out a circular letter to the county 
superintendents of education telling them of this special work for 
girls which would tend to enrich rural life. I asked those desiring 
to have the work started in their county to respond at once, as 
Mr. Knapp had requested that I take only a few counties the first 
year. There was not an overwhelming response. Six counties 
were selected—Henry and Madison in West Tennessee, Law- 
rence and Lincoln in Middle Tennessee and Bradley and Hamil- 
ton in East Tennessee. : 
It rained continually through the month of December, inter- 
fering on a number of occasions with our open air meetings. Janu- 
ary and February were the coldest months for years; too cold 
to make hot beds or for people to come out to hear me tell of the 
work. I remember at one place I had an audience of about 
one hundred men. As it was ten degrees below zero the women 
and girls did not come out. However, the weather was slightly 
warmer the next day and the girls and mothers came and a club
-P-A-G-E-440

of twenty-four members was organized. Many school improve- 
ment associations responded, but as Messrs. Knapp and Martin 
advised that I take up the work in only a few counties, I thought 
best to hold to the counties selected, even then going two beyond 
the number suggested by Mr. Knapp. 
After holding mass meetings in the selected counties, putting 
the work before the teachers and girls and organizing clubs, I 
appointed a County Collaborator, whose duty it was to give 
personal supervision to the work in the county. 
Mrs. Maggie Lansden was selected for Madison County, 
Prof. V.S. Bright, Henry County (later succeeded by Miss Rosa- 
mond Clark when Prof. Bright resigned to go to the West Ten- 
nessee Normal); Mrs. Myra A. N. Tandy, Lawrence County; 
Mrs. Jesse Hardin, Lincoln County; Miss Malissa Byrd, Bradley 
County. As these workers entered into the work so heartily I 
was permitted to do as I thought best about taking up more 
counties. President R. L. Jones invited me to the Middle 
Tennessee Normal to talk to the student body. While there, 
Prof. Verd Peterson, of the Agricultural Department, agreed to 
act as Collaborator and organize clubs in Rutherford County, 
with the Normal as the center. Prof Jones gave.one acre of land 
to be cultivated by ten of the teacher “tomato club girls,” the 
girls to have the proceeds. 
Prof. W. J. Sowder, of the Agricultural Department of the 
East Tennessee Normal, was appointed late in the season. | Supt. 
J. B. Brown, of Hamilton County, agreed to start a club around 
each of his four rural high schools. Supt. and Mrs. M. L. 
Hardin agreed to personally supervise their county. County 
boards of education in the above counties responded by supple- 
menting the funds furnished by the U. S. Government in an 
equal sum from the county. This enabled me, late in the 
season, to appoint Mrs. M. L. Hardin Collaborator in Benton 
County and Mrs. Elizabeth Lauderbach Collaborator in Hamil- 
ton County. One other thing I wanted to test was just how well 
the work could be done without a county collaborator. As 
Supt. J. G. Warden, of Coffee County, and Miss Julia Walker, 
County Superintendent of Dyer County, were eager for the 
work, county clubs were organized in*these counties, also one 
in Putnam County, Supt. J. M. Hatfield in charge. A few
-P-A-G-E-441

teachers: were authorized to organize clubs. Oak Grove School, 
Sumner County, Prof. Chas. A. Alden in charge; Curve School, 
Lauderdale County, Mrs. A. G. Scott in charge. 
Bolton High School, Shelby County, was the first club in the 
State, and was organized in the spring of 1911 by Mr. Thos. A. 
Early, State Agent Boys’ Corn Clubs. 
The U. S. Department of Agriculture, the State organizer 
and county collaborators, by numerous letters and personal 
visits, kept in close touch with the eight hundred members of 
the girls’ canning and poultry clubs, giving instructions with 
reference to the making of hot beds, preparation of soil for plant- 
ing, and when the spring days came, most of the girls were en- 
thusiastic for the work in the out-of-doors. However, the long 
rainy season and overflows retarded the work in many places. 
The girls were required to have one-tenth of an acre of ground 
(which is a tract 33 feet wide, 132 feet long, or 66 feet square.) 
The. girls were allowed to have the heavy work done, although 
about five girls did all the work. (This is discouraged.) Cir- 
cylars of instruction and a package of Stone tomato seed were 
furnished each club member by the U. S. Department of Agri- 
culture. 
County prizes were solicited by the State organizer and coun- 
ty collaborators. The business men of the various counties 
responded enthusiastically to this request, pledging a number of 
very valuable prizes. 
I requested the State Fair Association to give prizes and they 
responded with the following: 
1. For the counties making the best county exhibit of canned, 
preserved or pickled tomatoes, etc. Cash prize, $100.00. 
To be divided as follows: First prize, $40; second prize, $25; 
third prize, $20; fourth prize, $10; fifth prize, $5. 
2. For the rural school making best showing of canned prod- 
ucts, fresh products and illustrated booklets and reports, of the 
tomato (fresh tomatoes being limited to one peck), Canning 
outfit. 
3. Club member making best all round club exhibit, this 
exhibit to include fresh and canned products, and illustrated 
booklets on ‘How I Made My Crop.” Jersey calf.

(a) To see what team can put up the largest number of No. 3 
cans of tomatoes in 1 hour, teams permitted to arrange canning 
outfit, heat water, place utensils, before the time is called. 
Canvas tent for club use. 
9. Labelling contest. To the individual club member who 
can label the largest number of No. 3 cans in ten minutes. Cans

oral or written (to be determined). Fireless cooker. 
11, The club member who prepares the best drawing of her 
1-10-acre club plat, showitg its relation to the house, giving di- 
mensions and showing a drawing of canning outfit. (Direction 
from house, how far and its boundaries, fence.) Pair of India 
Runner Ducks. 
12. To the local club who can give thé best club yell, club 
song, and show the best club banner. Canning outfit. 
May 30, 31, June 1, a three days canning school was held at 
the Middle Tennessee Normal School, conducted by Mr. O. B. 
Martin, of the U.S, Department of Agriculture. All the county 
collaborators were called together at this time, all kinds of vege- 
tables and fruits were canned in glass and the commercial cans. 
A large canning demonstration for the county at large was held 
in each county by the State organizer and county collaborator. 
This proved a great boon for the work. Hundreds of people at- 
tended these meetings. Dr. Ayers, of the State University, 
requested that J hold a demonstration on the University grounds 
at the Summer School of the South, which I did June 29th.
-P-A-G-E-443
— 424 — 
The first county demonstration was held in Hamilton County, 
at the University of Chattanooga, July Ist. There was great 
enthusiasm and interest. Dr. Race, President of the University, 
led the “tomato club’ song. At some of the demonstrations, 
when the girls were given their first instructions, it was necessary 
at times to rope the crowds away. Many farmers bought the 
little home canner after once seeing how simple it was to operate, 
and with little effort many hundred dollars were saved in Ten- 
nessee in the way of surplus product, which has heretofore gone 
to waste. Very few of the girls canned less than fifty No. 3 
cans. One girl, Sylvia Richmond, of Soddy, Hamilton County, 
canned 1,174 No. 3 cans. Following is her report:

Another girl, Edith Cupp, Camden, Benton County, canned 
92 different products, making twenty varieties from the tomato. 
Cook books have been studied and searched by rural girls as 
never before. It is conservatively estimated that (100,000) one 
hundred thousand cans of tomatoes, beans, fruits and berries 
were canned and saved by the girls of the canning and poultry 
clubs of Tennessee the past summer. Many instances can be

—— 425 — 
given where the fathers and mothers fell in love with the work. 
through the girls’ club and as a result they have from fifty to one 
hundred and fifty dollars im instead of that much out. 
The social side of the girls’ canning and poultry club is 
worth consideration. After the girls have learned how to can 
at the public demonstrations the club of a community will meet 
from home to home and have a day of canning, the mothers 
acting as chaperones. In several counties the tomato club girls 
served tomato products at public affairs. In Benton County 
a tomato club luncheon of five courses was served. 
It was the instruction of the U. S. Department of Agriculture 
not to begin the poultry work until the canning club was well 
organized. 
The object of the girls’ club is: 
1. To provide some means by which girls may earn some 
money in rural homes. 
2. To help to furnish the home with a constant supply of 
vegetables, both canned and fresh. 
3. To encourage all rural families to live better and at a lower 
cost. 
4. To make the home and the farm more interesting and help- 
ful to all members of the family. 
5. To encourage teachers to vitalize their rural school work 
by correlating this work with their every day studies. 
The booklet work of the girls’ canning and poultry club at 
the State Fair was favorably commended by leading educators. 
Especially the booklets on ‘How I Made My Crop,” “Gardening 
and Canning Arithmetic’ and drawings of the girls’ plots. All 
this proves that the girls’ canning and poultry club work can be 
successfully correlated with the studies of the rural schools. 
The gilrs’ canning club exhibit was one of the great features of 
the State Fair. I invited the county collaborator and a team of 
six girls from six counties to be present and demonstrate in can- 
ning for one hour. Simple rules of contest were observed. 
The girls were allowed to have tomatoes washed and placed in 
blanching trays and utensils arranged before beginning the con- 
test. So much time was allowed for blanching, peeling, packing, 
capping, exhausting, tipping and processing, and for testing and
-P-A-G-E-445
— 426 — 
patching leaky cans. If any leaky cans were found after the 
close of the contest they were thrown out. In all the work of 
the girls not only was dexterity shown, but mental activity was 
brought into full play. They had to act rapidly and accurately, 
for time was not allowed for errors in judgment or otherwise. 
Hamilton County completed 81 cans, one leaky can was 
thrown out. Benton County came second with thirty-five cans, 
and fifteen cans lacking three minutes of processing within the 
hour. No leaky cans. Lawrence County came third with 
thirty-two cans completed. Many declared this more interesting 
than the horse racing. The labeling contests were also of much 
interest. Sylvia Richmond labelled fifty cans within ten min- 
utes. 
The remarkable poise of these ligtle country girls was shown. 
Three of the girls from Lawrence County had never been on the 
train before coming to the State Fair, but they could talk with 
ease to the large audiences and tell how they made their crops 
and canned their fruit. Many girls made their own canners, 
using a brick.furnace and wash tub, buying the capping steels 
and cappers for use in canning with the commercial tin cans. 
A ready market has been found in each county, and one mer- 
chant has asked me for a car load of the girls’ products next 
year. ‘ / 
The motto of the Girls’ Canning and Poultry Club is “To 
Make the Best Better;” their club trade mark is the open book, 
tomato, four leaf clover with an H in each leaf of the clover, 
signifying equal training of the head, heart, hand and health. 
At no time are acids allowed to be used in canning, the simple 
tules of sterilization are observed and the juice of fruit is used 
instead of water. This guarantees a pure product. 
Benton, Hamilton, Madison, Lincoln, Henry, Bradley and 
Lawrence counties have had most excellent county exhibits of 
the girls’ work during the months of October and November. 
Splendid prizes, consisting of wearing apparel; money, thor- 
oughbred poultry, garden tools, household furniture, etc., have 
been awarded. Mertie Hardin, of Benton County, won the 
Jersey calf and other valuable prizes at the State Fair. : 
At a reasonable estimate this work means ten thousand 
dollars has been saved by the rural girls of only a few counties.
-P-A-G-E-446
— 427 — 
This insures better living in the farm homes at a lower cost. 
Many girls are starting a college bank account from the pro- 
ceeds of their canned articles. 
Without the unselfish and untiring work of the county col- 
laborators this work could not have succeeded as it has during 
the short time of one year, and all praise should be given to the 
county superintendents of education who have co-operated in 
this movement, and to State Superintendent Brister for his wise 
counsel and hearty co-operation at all times. 
Respectfully submitted,

STATE INSTITUTES—1911-1912 
Eleven State institutes were held by the Department of 
Public Instruction in the summer of 1911, eight of them being 
for white teachers and three for colored teachers. In 1912, be- 
cause of the smaller appropriation made for this purpose, only 
seven were held; five of these were for white teachers and three 
for colored. It is proper to state, however, that in the latter 
year the Normal schools at Johnson City and Murfreesboro 
were open for white students and the Agricultural and Indus- 
triat Normal: School for Negroes held a summer course. In all 
these summer sessions special courses were offered to the teachers 
of the State; consequently, there was no lack of opportunity for 
those desiring to do special summer work. : 
All of the institutes were well attended both summers and 
their work was of a fine type and very successful. In 1912 it 
was estimated that 1,000 teachers of the State were in attendance 
upon the summer session of the University of the South at Knox- 
ville; 1,000 more were at the summer sessions of the white normal 
schools; 1,500 attended the five State institutes, and 700 colored 
teachers enrolled in the Agricultural and Industrial Normal 
School for Negroes and the two State institutes. This makes 
approximately 4,200 of the public school teachers of the State in 
school for four weeks or more during the past summer. — In ad- — 
dition to this, institutes were held in at least sixty-five counties 
with enrollment ranging from 50 to 200; so that it is safe to as- 
sume that 7,500 teachers of the public schools of Tennessee during 
last summer were in attendance at some kind of school, with the 
hope of increasing their efficiency and benefiting their schools. 
This is a most remarkable record when the meagre salary which 
is paid to teachers in this State is taken into consideration. 
Work OF THE INSTITUTES. 
The instruction given at the institutes followed along lines 
already marked out, especially in the summer of 1911; that is, 
the regular public school branches were taught with renewed 
emphasis upon the pedagogical aspects of the various cotirses.
-P-A-G-E-451
— 432 — 
In 1912 several new features were introduced into the in- 
stitutes which added interest and vitality to them. The best 
available agricultural teachers were secured, and this phase of 
work was stressed at every place. For the first time some in- 
struction in domestic science was offered in the institutes of 
1912. The work, of course, was of the most elementary charac- 
ter, but the teachers in attendance were given an introduction to 
this most important subject, and it is certain that the instruction 
has helped them to vitalize their school work and in some in- 
stances has inspired them to further pursue it. With the present 
type of school in Tennessee and the many and heavy tasks which 
the teachers are carrying, we cannot hope to do very successful 
work in agriculture and domestic science in the country schools, 
but in the institutes we are endeavoring to show the teachers 
something of the possibility of this work, as well as the need of 
its being taught, and giving them such simple instruction as 
they can make use of in the crudest school situation. 
Another feature of the institutes of 1912 was the Adult 
School. Attempt was made to induce farmers and patrons of 
the school in the counties adjoining the institutes to attend them 
_ during several days when lectures were delivered to school 
people and the general public. The purpose of this movement 
was to bring the teachers and the general public together to dis- 
cuss common problems and to consider their common interests. 
The State Departments of Agriculture and Health co-operated 
in this work with the Department of Public Instruction and sent 
lecturers to the institutes to give special instruction in their 
various lines of work. This Adult School can be made especially 
valuable in our State institutes, and it is proposed to pay even 
more attention to it during the coming summer. 
The following circular shows the scope of the work in do- 
mestic science attempted in the State institutes:

PREFACE. 
This bulletin is prepared-as a supplement to demonstrations in Domestic 
Science in Summer Institutes. 
It contains a few practical lessons which it is hoped will be of value to 
teachers of village and rural schools, in which no provision has been made for 
Domestic Science. 
It is intended that these elementary lessons shall be given in the schools, 
and it is hoped that much may be accomplished in the improvement of existing 
conditions in many of the homes. 
THE OBJECT OF THIS COURSE, 
1. To impress the teachers with the importance of improving the homes 
of the communities in which they teach by making the children of those homes 
more capable and efficient. 
Il. To give a few practical lessons in Domestic Science, which may- be 
demonstrated in any school. 
h III. To make these lessons of value by connecting the school with the 
ome. 
IV. To impress the teachers with the possibilities through Domestic 
Science of raising the standard of the (1) individual pupil; (2) of the home; 
(8) of the school; (4) of the community; and of increasing the health, happiness 
and prosperity of the home, the school and the community. 
V. To emphasize the opportunity for correlation, economy, and efficiency . 
A Domestic Science Course 
A BRIEF COOKING COURSE. 
Especially suited to the needs of the teachers of village and rural schools. 
GENERAL SUGGESTIONS. 
I. All measurements are level. 
II. Level a cup or spoon by scraping gently with a knife. 
III. Glass measuring cups are much more accurate, convenient and cleanly 
than ordinary tin cups. 
_ IV. Alicup measurements in the following recipes are based on 1 cup or 24 pint. 
V. Measure meal, flour or fine sugar after sifting. 
VI. Do not allow an extra amount for “good measure.” 
TABLE MEASUREMENTS. 
3 teaspoons (t) equal 1 tablespoon (T)

ESSENTIALS IN COOKING. 
I, Personal neatness. 
IL. Cleanliness. 
III. System and regularity in work. 
IV. Variety in food selection. 
V. Exactness in measurements. 
VI. Careful attention. 
VII. Economy. 
One quart (qt.) of each of the following will serve six persons: 
I, Soup. IV. Chocolate. 
Il. Coffee or tea. ‘ V. Ice cream. 
TI. Cooked cereal. VI. Custard. 
VII. Oysters. 
COMMON METHOD OF APPLYING HEAT. 
I. Boiling—Cooking in water at.a boiling temperature, 212 degrees, 
Fahrenheit (F). 
pt Stewing—Cooking in water below the boiling point, 160-198 degrees 
Ill, Frying—Cooking in deep fat cooked foods require more heat and less 
time for frying than uncooked. 
IV. Sauteing—Cooking in a small amount of fat—commonly called frying. 
V._Broiling—Cooking over hot coals, or under a gas flame, or in a hot pan. 
Sear the surface by extreme heat, and then cook more slowly. This preserves 
all of the juices and flavors the meat. 
Never pound steak before broiling it. 
VI. Roasting—Cooking meat by surrounding the whole surface with heat. 
FOODS. 
In a study of Domestic Science in its many phases with their important 
relations to the home and to every member of the home, probably the epatest 
problems to be considered is food, its composition and cooking. at is 
food? : 
“Food is that which taken into the body builds tissue and yields heat and energy.” 
What is the best food? 
The best food is— 
1st. The most healthful—that food which is best suited to the needs of the consumer. 
2nd. The most economical—that which furnishes the greatest amount of nourishment at the lowest cost. : 
lr order to understand food and its relation to the body it is necessary to study something of the composition of food. 
As our bodies are composed of different elements uniting to form different 
substances—bone, flesh, muscle, hair, teeth, skin, etc., so also are the foods 
that are used in the building up of these bodies composed of different elements. 
The chief elements which enter into our food products are carbon, oxygen, 
and hydrogen from the air and water; nitrogen from the air through plants; 
calcium, phosphorous, sulphur and potash from the rock and soil through 
vegetables,
-P-A-G-E-455
— 436 — ' 
These elements unite in ‘different proportions to form our foods and for 
convenience we have named some of the combinations; and we find that food 
consists of five compounds: - 
(1) Protein, (2) Fat, (8) Carbohydrates, (4) Mineral Matter, (5) Water. 
I. Under Protein we find— 
1, Albumen (in white of egg). 3. Myosin (in lean meat). 
2, Gluten (in grain or cereal). 4, Casein (in cheese and milk). 
§. Fibrin (in blood), 
Il. Under Fat we find— 
1. Butter. 3. Fat of meat. 
- 2. Cream. 4. Fish. 
. 5. Cereal. 
Ill. Under Carbohydrates we find— 
1. Starches. 2, Sugar. 
3. Glucose, 
IV. Under Minerals we find— 
1. Sodium chloride (common salt), 3. Calcium. 
2. Magnesium. 4, Iron. 
5. Phosphorous,

Two and one-half pounds of solid food and three pints of water is about the amount required each day for the body of an adult. 
Food that is used by the body is either tissue building or heat producing. The proteins largely include the first class; the carbohydrates and fats the ‘latter. The {uel value of food is measured in calories, as heat in the body or atmosphere is measured by degrees.
-P-A-G-E-456

CALORIES. 
A calorie is the common measure for the heat producing property of foods. 
Itis the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of 
water four degrees, F, 
Thus we speak of potatoes having a fuel value of 375 calories per pound. 
The following table gives the fuel value of most of our common foods. From 
a careful study of both, it will be seen that careful planting of the bill-of-fare 
is important both winter and summer. For example, oatmeal contains about 
85 per cent of food properties and has a fuel value of 1,845 calories per pound; 
whole rice contains 86 per cent-of food properties and has a fuel value of 1,630 
calories per pound, and should be preferred for a summer food. .

MILK. 
I. Tests for the constituents of milk— . : 
Experiment I—Drop milk or cream on a blotter or unglazed paper. Whiz 
kind of spot does it make? 
Experiment II]—Test with iodine. Is starch present? 
Experiment I1J—Taste sweet, then sour milk. Why does the first tas 
sweet? 
Experiment IV-——Boil some milk. Observe the steam which rises. A filt 
forms over the top. What is it? 
Experiment V—Add an acid (vinegar) to milk. What happens? 
II. Food value— 
Milk is the sole food for the young of many animals. It conti) 
- elements needed for the nourishment of these animals, and is ofte 
“perfect food.” For adults milk alone is not a perfect food. 
Why Milk Sours: Milk sours because of an acid formed by: 
They feed on the milk sugar or lactose and convert it into lactic acid: also give the characteristic taste to butter and cheese. Care of Milk: Bacteria grows very rapidly in milk. Therefore the utmos care should be taken for clean handling, storing and serving of milk.

H. E. Watters, conductor of the institute at Martin in 1911, 
made the following statement in regard to the institute: 
“The institute was unanimously voted a decided success by 
teachers and faculty. The attendance was unusually large, en- 
rollment being 420, ‘besides instructors and visitors. The per- 
sonnel of the student body was far above the average. Most of 
those in attendance were teachers of experience, and their age 
and culture gave a noticeable degree of strength and refinement 
to the appearance and conduct of the student body. The in-. 
structors were unanimous in praise of the conduct of the teachers. 
There was a total absence of loafers, or those having a dis- 
‘position to shirk serious work. In fact, the common remark 
of all visitors was ‘I never saw such hard working teachers.’ 
Professional enthusiasm reached a high point.’ 
Of the institute at Martin in 1912, Conductor Watters writes: 
“The institute was highly satisfactory in every respect to 
the instructors and teachers. The attendance exceeded that of 
the previous year, being 462, besides instructors and visitors.” 
Of the work of. his colleagues in both institutes he speaks 
words of highest praise. , 
Mr. H. H. Ellis, who was conductor of the institute at Paris 
in 1911, had the following statement to make in regard to the 
institute: 
“YT have never seen a more orderly, hard working body of 
teachers anywhere. No ‘campus course’ was indulged in during 
the entire institute. The instructors were persons of ability, 
and handled their subjects in an interesting manner and to the 
satisfaction of the entire body of teachers.” 
Conductor Harry Clark, of the institute at Manchester in 
1911, had this to say: 
“Our students were as hard working and attentive body as 
I ever saw, and every one in Manchester commented upon their 
serious attitude. They were all in their places even during the 
open hour, and there was no running out after roll call. Let me 
commend all our faculty for their hard working, tireless efforts.” 
S. H. Thompson, writing of the institute at Clinton in 1912, 
says: . 
“T have never seen a better institute or teachers who were 
more attentive to their work. I want to thank you for the ex- 
cellent faculty you gave me.”

W. F. Moncreiff, conductor of the institute at Centerville in 
1912, made the following statement in regard to the institute: 
“In some respects this has been the most remarkable insti- 
tute I have ever known. The cordial feeling and hearty co- 
operation among institute teachers and between them and their 
teacher-studerits has been most unusual. There has not been 
a jar or a discord of any kind. The work of the teacher-students 
has been ‘the most serious, universal and enthusiastic I have 
ever seen. The pedagogical harmony in the faculty has been 
most happy and complete. The keynote of all the work has 
‘been the State Superintendent’s most cherished pedagogical 
tenet—the unity and interdependence of home, school and com- * 
munity, and it has been sounded in perfect unison by all members 
of the faculty and reinforced into a veritable crescendo by the 
pedagogical, agricultural and domestic science departments. 
The work of these three departments could scarcely have been 
fitted together more perfectly had it been planned by the three 
teachers in conjunction, and the reason is that they all had the 
same pedagogical inspiration in their bones and blood and brain. 
But the most remarkable feature of the whole institute was the 
enthusiastic and intelligent response of teacher-pupils and citizens 
to this new idea of utilizing the home activities and interests of 
the child in the school, thereby vitalizing his school work by giv- 
ing it motive and meaning, and fitting him for better practical 
service in the home and in the community. I have never seen 
citizens so aroused by an institute as those of Centerville were. 
The agriculture and domestic science classes were so crowded 
by them that it was impossible to keep a record of their attend- 
ance. Three hundred citizens at the institute would be a con- 
servative estimate, and many of them were regular. I emphasize 
- this to show how the people respond to the conception of the 
school as a function of the whole community and to the practice 
of actually introducing its every day activities into the daily 
program, for this was the chief difference between this and other 
institutes I have held.” 
These comments are sufficient to indicate the strength of 
the teaching force, the character of the student and the type of 
instruction at the various institutes. 
Below is given a statistical description of all the State in- 
stitutes held during the present biennial period.

ANDERSON COUNTY. 
I submit the following general statements concerning the 
school conditions in Anderson County, for the year ending June 
80, 1912. 
My plans have been to work up a consolidation of schools 
wherever opportunity seemed to offer; to encourage more whole- . 
some sanitary conditions in the school rooms, and beauty in 
buildings and grounds; to encourage patrons and pupils to read 
good literature; to keep the public mind centered on the progress 
of the schools, and to intensify interest in higher education. 
Notwithstanding the many drawbacks to consolidation jn - 
this mountain section, and the many minds antagonistic to the 
idea, the Dossett School, of some 85 pupils, and the Elm Hall 
School of some 90 pupils, both paralyzed with weakness incident 
to an overcrowded curriculum and the other hindrances of one- 
room school buildings, have been consolidated in a magnificent 
three-room structure at Marlow—a building at once a model 
of architecture, beauty and modern convenience, and a school 
which will be the pride of‘the whole community. Other schemes 
are on foot, but I make particular mention of this one instance 
as a signal victory for intelligence and an omen of better things 
to come at no far distant day. 
In an effort to overcome the evil of the public drinking cup 
and the unclean habit of all pupils drinking from water dipped 
from the same buckets, water coolers were purchased, and each 
teacher instructed to require all pupils to use individual drinking 
cups. 
Many school grounds have been fenced and flowers and grass 
made to take the place of briers and nettles. It is now no un- 
common sight to see potted flowers sitting about in the school- 
rooms of our county, and beautiful pictures adorning hitherto 
bare walls. This has all been accomplished through the local 
energy of teacher, pupils and patrons, and is a just tribute to the 
efforts of the school improvement associations of the county. 
During the last three years 42 libraries have been established, 
with a total of 4,443 volumes. All these have been established 
through some kind of public entertainment and the aid furnished 
through the library fund of the General Education Bill. The
-P-A-G-E-491
~~ 470 — 
books are eagerly read in the school rooms and in the homes and 
are doing much to diffuse general knowledge and enlightenment 
among the masses. 
Our public schools have been watched more closely during the 
last few years than ever before in their history. This has been 
largely due to the interest taken by the press of the county. 
The agitation of educational subjects in the Anderson County 
News alone during the last three years, would be enough for a 
good sized bound volume. This close public censorship is one 
of the greatest safeguards of the system. 
The high school fund has been continually . on the increase 
, and high school interest growing. One hundred and forty-seven 
high school pupils were enrolled in the high schools of the county 
during the year just closed, and an average daily attendance of 
one hundred and fourteen was maintained. 
While conditions have been gratifying in many respects, we 
are not growing as we ought, or as we could. More vigorous 
supervision of the schools, more business-like and close, atten- 
tion to every detail, by specialists, well paid and devoting their 
entire time to the work, is absolutely necessary to a safe and 
economic administration of school affairs. Enough money is 
wasted every year by attempting to run the schools as a side 
line, by men engaged in other professions, to more than pay the 
' salaries of a commission of real school men for their entire time 
and exclusive attention to the work. 
Respectfully submitted, 
A. C. Duéerns, 
County Superintendent. 
BEDFORD COUNTY. 
Responding to your request for a general statement in regard 
to the school situation in this county (Bedford), I have to say: 
First—I have endeavored to create a sentiment for the con- 
solidation of schools. My plan has been to abandon small 
schools wherever practicable, and I am now endeavoring to 
have a trial made of transportation in one community where 
the school has been abandoned. I am meeting obstacles.
-P-A-G-E-492
— 471 — 
Second—I am urging school improvement through a county 
association and local associations. In case societies cannot be 
formed, then I urge individual work on the part of the teacher 
and such patrons as he may be able to interest. I am expecting 
—aye, seeing now—excellent results. 
Third—I am anxious that something be done for backward 
children, those suffering from defective eye sight, partial deaf- 
ness, adenoids, etc.; also, such as for any cause, are too old for 
the grades in which they are found. In this matter I hope to 
accomplish little more than an investigation as I visit schools 
this autumn, and a calling of the attention of teachers and others 
to this very important matter. - 
I feel that our system of grading is not procuring the desired 
results, but in view of the probability of radical legislation by 
our coming Legislature, I am trying nothing new. 
I suppose we all know that with the very best system possible, 
satisfactory results cannot be had with our irregular attendance 
and our short terms. 
Respectfully submitted, / 
W. E. THompson, 
County Superintendent. 
BENTON COUNTY. 
I have tried very hard to work out plans for consolidation of 
schools in my county, but have not yet succeeded in doing a 
great deal along that line. The main thing accomplished is a 
strong sentiment for consolidation growing all over the county. 
School houses were especially bad when my term of office 
began, and some still are, but we are steadily decreasing the 
number of insanjtary, unsightly houses, and building neat, com- 
fortable houses in their place. We have replaced five such 
houses within the past year, in one case with a $1,200 building. 
The attendance record is improving, as you will see from my 
annual reports for the past two years. Our teaching force is 
becoming stronger. About 50 teachers attended State institutes 
and summer schools this year and these teachers are showing the
-P-A-G-E-493
— 472 — 
good results of their added training. Supervision is not so thor- 
~ ough as should be on account of number of schools and distance 
apart. We have not placed any permanent libraries the past 
two years, but the State traveling libraries are proving a great 
help and are being used enthusiastically by our teachers. 
Our corn and tomato clubs have proved a great success. We 
closed the work for the year November 2nd and 4th with a splen- 
did corn and canning exhibit, attended by large crowds. This 
_ work has done much to increase the interest of the farmers in 
the public schools, and promises to be one of the greatest educa- 
‘tional forces yet started in the rural districts. 
M. L. Harpin, 
County Superintendent. 
BLOUNT COUNTY. 
During the past two years Blount County has made progress 
along educational lines. We have a good growing public senti- 
ment for better conditions educationally. 
Several new houses have been built and a number of houses 
supplied with good desks. We have several old houses that 
need to be replaced with new houses, and the number reduced 
by consolidation. We have worked for this sentiment, but as 
yet we have failed. : 
We have a compulsory attendance school law, which increased 
the enrollment and the attendance since it has been in force. 
But unless it becomes a general State law, with some changes, it 
can not bring the best results. 
We have made an effort to get our schools better graded, and 
I think we have succeeded fairly well, yet there is need of im- 
provement in this line. 
A special effort has been made toward beautifying and making 
more attractive the interior of the houses and grounds; the 
results are very gratifying. : 
We have a few libraries in the county, but not as many as 
there should be. We hope to improve in this regard. 
We have a large enrollment in our Boys’ Corn Club, consider- 
ing the late date in the spring when we began. The boys have ~ 
been very much interested in the work. .
-P-A-G-E-494
— 473 — 
Our teaching force is improving each year. I have been 
visiting schools in this county for ten years and I am glad to say 
for the teachers that the schools are being better managed and 
better taught this year than in any other year in my experience. 
The supervision of a county as large as ours and with moun- 
tains and coves is not what it should be, but yet I am able to 
keep in close touch with the work through reports, teachers’ 
meetings and visitation. We need other and better provisions 
for a closer supervision. The work is too much for one man to do 
successfully. : 
We are very much interested in the cause of education, and 
hope to.see the work move forward. 
H. B. McCatt, ° 
County Superintendent. ® 
BRADLEY COUNTY. 
We have been fighting for bond issue of $20,000 since January 
lst. We hope yet to secure this fund and demonstrate to the 
people of our county the advantage of consolidation, by building 
one or two good consolidated schools. We also want this fund 
to be set aside for the purpose of equipment and repair work so 
we may be able to use the entire fund now coming in from the 
tax levy for the teachers’ salaries only. We find many in our 
rural districts satisfied with the present conditions—poor build- 
ings and equipment—simply because they have never enjoyed 
the best. They have never seen better conditions and have no 
idea of what the improvements are needed. A man recently 
in one of our rural districts said to me, ‘‘We need no better house; 
this one is better than most of the homes in our community.” 
This man is honest and would stand for improvement if he could 
once see its desirability. In order to remedy this condition, which 
is startling, our board on June 3, 1913, elected a County Super- 
visor, whose business it is to go into the rural community and 
organize school improvement associations. These associations 
_ improve and beautify the school houses and thereby give the 
people a taste of the better, which will by and by demand modern 
consolidated up-to-date school buildings.
-P-A-G-E-495
— 474 — 
Every school in our county now, save seven, has an associa- 
tion. Every association is at work. During the past two months 
they have raised and partly expended nearly $400. A parlor 
schoolhouse will make a parlor home. And school conditions 
in many sections of our county must affect better home. condi- 
.tions, rather than have home conditions affect school conditions. 
Our teaching force is not what it ought to be, and to make 
it better our board, on January, 1910, adopted the following 
resolutions: 
“WHEREAS, The State has established the East Tennessee 
Normal at Johnson City for the education and training of the 
teachers for the public schools, and 
, |Wuereas, The schools of this county need better prepared” 
teachers, it is hereby 
“Resolved, By the County Board of Bradley County, that 
after one year from the opening of the Normal School, when in- 
experienced teachers are applicants for positions in this county, 
this board will give preference to those who have attended the 
Normal School, and as far as possible higher salaries ‘will be paid 
to Normal School graduates than to other inexperienced teach- ” ers. 
This resolution sent 12 of our teachers to Normal School and 
increased efficiency of our teaching force from 18 to 33}4 per 
cent. We raised the salary of every teacher who attended. 
Our board in 1911 passed the following resolutions: 
“All applicants for positions in the schools of Bradley County 
for the year 1913 and thereafter—present teaching force except- 
ed—must have had not less than two years high school training, 
or its equivalent, must have attended a summer school or in- 
stitute before they will be considered eligible candidates for po- 
sitions in the schools of Bradley County. A certificate of work 
done in the summer school or teachers’ institute must be pre- 
sented next June, and thereafter, in connection with a certificate 
of qualification as required by law as a prerequisite to signing a 
contract. It is a question of little time until you will be required 
to hold a certificate of graduation from a high school or a Normal 
School before you can become a teacher in the schools of Bradley.
-P-A-G-E-496

We have about thirty-five public school libraries in our 
county. These libraries are being fairly well kept. We are 
making an effort through the School Improvement Association 
to supply cases and systematize this part of our work. 
We have the best Corn Club in East Tennessee, with an en- 
rollment of 97 boys. Hope to have at least 50 reports at our 
Corn Club fair this month. Sixty girls enrolled in Tomato 
Club.’ Girls selling products at good Prices. They will also 
exhibit at fair. 
Through rural supervisor and improvement workers we are 
making an effort to enroll ‘all pupils-of scholastic age. This, 
however, we found impossible, but results are gratifying. Our 
total enrollment increased each month, save one, during the 
school year of 1911-1912. 
We have plan now on foot to build a consolidated school. 
This building will possibly be ready by first of year. 
Sam Y. Apcocx, 
. County Superintendent. 
CARROLL COUNTY. 
I am glad to give below a few items of our public school con- 
ditions in Carroll County. 
We have only been able to run our schools five months in the 
year. This seems to be about the best we can do with the amount 
of funds we have. By rigid economy the teachers receive a little 
better salaries than they have been receiving, still they are not 
well paid for their services. 
Four years ago there were one hundred and seventeen school- 
houses in the county. Now there are one hundred and eight. 
During this time there have been built two extra houses, but at 
the same time several houses have been consolidated and thereby 
the number has been reduced. Four consolidated houses take 
the place of eleven old ones. 
Transportation has been tried on a small scale. The experi- 
ment was so satisfactory that the board proposes to try it on a 
larger scale next year.
-P-A-G-E-497
—— 476 — 
ATTENDANCE RECORD. 
The daily attendance during the past two years has been 
greatly increased. During this period the daily attendance has 
been raised “from 39 per cent to 44 per cent. I account for this 
increase in attendance largely by reason of my having the teachers 
issue ‘‘Perfect Attendance Certificates” and “Awards of Honor.’’ 
LiBRaRIEs. 
Carroll County now has twenty-six public school libraries 
secured through State aid. This puts a library in one out of every 
three of the white schools of the county. We also have six sets 
of the Tennessee State libraries in circulation. I find that these 
libraries: are filling a wonderful mission in our public schools. 
Through them the “reading habit” is being acquired by both 
parents and students. Besides, I find they are excellent ‘‘fill- 
ers-in” to keep pupils busy in the schoolroom. 
SANITATION AND VENTILATION. 
Among other things, I have stressed sanitation and ventila- 
tion, as inclosed report will show, during the past year. Houses 
have been swept and scoured, the school yard cleared of logs and 
brush, springs and wells cleaned out and repaired. I insist that 
perfect conditions must exist before students. can do perfect 
work. 
TEACHERS. 
Many of our teachers took advantage of the Summer School 
of the South and the State institutes during’ the past summer, 
and thereby greatly improved their ability and powers as teachers. 
Out of about one hundred white teachers that we employ in our 
county, twenty-seven of them attended: the Summer School of 
the South at Knoxville and sixty the State institutes. We only 
had about 30 per cent of our white teachers and the colored teachers 
left to take the county examinations. 
Our GreaTEsT NEEDS. 
‘More money, longer terms, consolidation and transportation, 
more professionally trained teachers, compulsory attendance 
school law.
-P-A-G-E-498
— 477 — 
We want to stress the county high school proposition from 
now on. 
D. T. BARNHILL, 
County Superintendent. 
CARTER COUNTY. 
I herewith submit my annual report of the school work for 
the year ending June 30, 1912. 
While the schools are not what we would have them, we have 
made substantial progress. The State institute did a splendid 
work for us, the effect of which has been very marked in all the 
schools. I held local rallies in almost every community in the 
county during the school term. . 
Prof. Mathes ably assisted me in this work. The patrons 
attended in large numbers, and did everything to make the meet- 
ings a success. I also held teachers’ meetings in many places 
in the county. The County Board has done excellent service. 
They have at all times, I think, tried to do their full duty. 
During the school year we have built eight good, substantial 
schoolhouses. We have in almost every district, a splendid 
schoolhouse, well equipped with desks and other modern im- 
provements. . 
The board has spent, during the year, about $6,000.00 for 
buildings and furniture. Most of the houses built are two- 
room houses of the latest type. 
The interest the people have taken has been very gartifying. 
They donated more than a thousand dollars, which stands as 
the greatest evidence of their interest in the welfare of their 
- children. 
We have consolidated several schools; where there were 
two or three little weak, poorly taught schools, we now have one 
good central school, taught by competent teachers. 
The teachers have shown commendable zeal in their work, 
and most of them have been successful. . 
The greatest needs of our rural schools are better houses and 
stronger teachers. .
-P-A-G-E-499
— 478 — 
The graded course prepared by the State Superintendent has 
aided our teachers very much in their work. Most all our schools 
are graded. 
With better houses, stronger teachers, we hope to do much 
better work next year. 
M. D. ALLEN, 
County Superintendent. 
CHESTER COUNTY. 
The schools. of Chester County for the past two years have 
made but little change. It is difficult to improve our teaching 
force, due to the fact that our funds are small, and this necessi- 
tates a large per cent of new teachers each session. -Our attend- 
ance is comparatively small and seems hard to bring it up to 
what it should be. We have been trying to consolidate a number 
of our schools, and under our last board I feel sure that eleven 
of our houses will be reduced to five within the next year. Ex- 
ceeding bad roads in winter have been the greatest hindrance, 
but this matter is receiving attention by the County Court and 
the outlook is brighter now. We have no extensive libraries 
nor clubs in our county... It is our purpose to look to these soon. 
We have made progress in cutting out summer sessions and 
giving one continuous term during the winter months. We have 
some reasons to be hopeful of better conditions in our county. 
N. B. HARDEMAN, 
County Superintendent. 
COCKE COUNTY. 
This is one of the wealthiest counties in the State in natural 
resources, which are practically undeveloped, yet our County 
Court seems to think that we are very poor, as the court gives 
us a county levy of 5 cents for primary schools, which is the 
lowest tate in the State.  
-P-A-G-E-500
— 479 — 
But better things await us, I am sure, for next January we 
shall have our school tax raised to 10 or 15 cents. We havea 
few justices who would vote 25 cent tax, but knowing that most 
of them would oppose’ the rate, we think it best to strike a happy 
medium and take a 10 or 15 cents levy rather than take a risk 
in regard to a raise. 
The main reason why our county is so backward about giving 
the schools a higher tax is that the county.has just about spent 
$300,000.00 on pikes, and about: $9,000.00 on bridges, and more 
pikes wanted. 
But all these should be self-paying propositions if looked at 
from the right view-point, or they should not have been built. 
With all these conditions confronting us, it makes the school 
question look gloomy, yet we are having the best schools this 
year than we have ever had; teachers and pupils seem to be better 
satisfied, and are working in harmony. Very little consolidation 
can be done in this county because of the rivers, mountains and’ 
roads. Now and then we get to place a two-roomed house for 
two small houses, and the people have always been pleased with 
the change. We are building about four good houses each year 
and equipping some with patent desks, and boards at an average 
cost of $800. 
Our’schools run from four to five months each year. 
Our teachers do good work, yet many of them are deficient, 
and it seems that we cannot remedy the situation while our 
taxés are so deficient. I believe one teacher should teach two 
schools, but my! what a howl some of the patrons would make. 
We have three very good county high schools, but we are 
handicapped again for want of funds. Each school has a small 
‘library, and only one has a very deficient laboratory, the others 
have none at all. None of our high schools have domestic 
science, agricultural or manual training departments. I have 
been trying for these departments to be connected with at least 
one of our high schools, but the cry has always been “too much 
money.” 
We have a few libraries in the county which are very bene- 
ficial, but we can’t keep the books together because of the negli- 
gence of the librarian. 
We have our first Corn Club this year and one of the boys 
has reported 112 bushels, 16 pounds per acre.
-P-A-G-E-501
— 480!— 
We have done very little school improvement work this year 
under any organized club. Our school term is very short, and 
from this fact it is almost impossible to interest our teachers, 
as about all improvements made would vanish before the next 
term. . 
Our compulsory school law secures good results; it has in- 
creased attendance at least twenty per cent. 
: R. P. DrisxkILt, 
County Superintendent. 
DAVIDSON COUNTY. 
I herewith submit a special report as to school conditions 
in Davidson County. For the past four years we have consist- 
.ently followed the policy of consolidation. During 1911 and 
1912 we have erected eight new buildings at an average cost of 
$2,500, and have made additions to nine school houses at an 
average cost of $800 each. In almost every instance the consoli- 
dation of two or more small schools has resulted in an increase 
of nearly 25 per cent in attendance. 
The teachers of Davidson are enthusiastic in their efforts to 
better conditions. Our greatest handicap is.the lack of funds 
to pay adequate salaries. There is a difference of over $30 in 
the average salary of teachers in the city and county schools, 
and every year a number of our teachers enter the Nashville 
schools. It is our purpose to work for bond issues by the county 
to erect new schoolhouses and thereby increase the school funds 
available for teachers’ salaries. In order to increase efficiency, 
our county board this year adopted the policy of paying teachers 
full salary for two weeks’ attendance at the county institute; and 
in order to give them a chance to attend summer schools and in- 
stitutes elsewhere. 
Our meeting was held in August, just before the opening of our 
schools. The result was the most successful county institute 
we have ever held. As a means of securing greater efficiency in 
primary work, our board has appointed one of our skilled primary 
teachers, under the direction of the County Superintendent, to 
supervise the work of teachers of first, second and third grades.

She is to visit schools where special instruction is needed, and at 
each monthly meeting to give suggestive outlines for the next 
month’s work. The indications are that this plan will be very - 
satisfactory. 
We have no county high school, but for this term the county _ 
board pays tuition in the Nashville High School for all county 
pupils who have completed the 10th grade. We have over 
30 local school libraries and are using 6 circulating State libra- 
ries. I consider this work very important, both for its culture 
value and its use to supplement the regular school studies. 
We have several School Improvement Associations, and in 
all our schools the spirit of this work is active. It is an-unusual 
thing in Davidson County to find a school where conditions ate 
not good. For the year 1911-12, our average attendance was 
67 per cent of the enrollment, but only about 40 per cent of the 
scholastic population. To remedy this condition is one of our 
problems, a question that confronts the entire State. 
In a general sense the schools of Davidson County are making 
progress and the outlook is encouraging. 
W. C. ANDERSON, 
_ County Superintendent. 
DECATUR COUNTY. 
In reply to your recent request I wish to say that there has 
been a great improvement in the schools of our county during 
the last two years. There has been a great deal done in the way 
of providing better buildings. Under the management of the 
County Board of Education there have been many buildings re- 
paired and five new houses have taken the place of older ones. 
We have about completed at our county site a large two- 
story brick, and I have been taking the advantage of every 
opportunity to have our County Court give us a high school. 
We feel that the time is almost at hand when Decatur County 
will have a good high school. 
Two years ago when time came to start our summer schools 
we had a little more than $100.00 on hand and about $1,000.00 16
-P-A-G-E-505

indebtedness. This year we have enough money to run our 
summer schools and about $1,000.00 more. 
Our summer normal of one and one-half months, followed by 
a two weeks’ institute, did a great deal to inspire the teachers of 
this county to a higher education and we learn that twenty-five 
of our teachers are attending the State Normal at Memphis. 
As a whole, our county is better equipped for houses, teachers 
and money than ever before in its history, and we feel, after 
visiting every school in the county twice this year, that the pa- 
trons are becoming aroused to the necessity of a higher education. 
Gero. L. WorTHAM, 
County Superintendent. 
DEKALB COUNTY. 
The matter of greatest importance in the school line in this 
county for the last two years was the establishment of two 
county high schools. We are now working to hold these. 
The country schools have done well this year, but we hope 
to do better next year. We expect to have better qualified teach- 
ers. * 
There has been no special move yet towards consolidation. 
We will have to have better roads first. 
J. S. Woop, - 
County Superintendent. 
DICKSON COUNTY. 
The schools of Dickson County are improving somewhat, I 
think, from the reports which I have received from all parts of 
the county. 
We have built no new schoolhouses this year; I have not en- 
couraged such because I felt we could not make such consolida- 
tions as was best for the schools of this county. However, we 
have three new buildings planned now, and by so doing, we expect 
to have three schoolhouses instead of five.. I am urging our 
County Board of Education to make an effort to have at least 
one school less every time a new schoolhouse is built. ~

I feel that a good high. school is much needed in Dickson 
County. We have had some good speeches made in the county 
on that subject by Prof. R. L. Jones, Prof. P. L. Harned, and 
others, which has aroused the people to some extent, but so far, 
we have no high school. 
We take the reading circle work up each year as soon as the 
books are selected, and our teachers find this course both inter- 
esting and helpful by attending the bi-monthly meetings. 
We had a good county institute this year. Many teachers 
expressed themselves as being greatly benefited by attending 
same. I was assisted in the institute by local talent, who are 
experienced teachers.

DYER COUNTY. 
The improvement on the rural schools of this county has been 
rather slow, but steady. We are much hampered by being under 
the district director system, but, as most of the directors seem to 
‘ take a great deal of interest in the schools, things are not nearly 
so bad as they might be. 
In the past two years, we have established seven libraries, 
supplemented three, and have organized a Teachers’ Library 
Association, the yearly fees of one dollar per member being used. 
for the purchase of books and magazines. Part of the County 
Superintendent’s office is fitted up as a reading room for the 
teachers. We have a set of travelling libraries from the State 
Library. These are sent to communities where there is no li- 
brary interest, and we hope by this means to arouse the people 
to their need of permanent libraries. 
We have eliminated seven one-teacher schools, and have built 
three comfortable, two-room schoolhouses, and have replaced 
three old one-room buildings with new ones. About half of our 
schools now use modern steel desks, and we are putting these 
desks in the other schools as rapidly as possible. 
The bad weather and the overflow last spring rather dis- 
couraged some of our corn and tomato club members, but the 
outlook for next year is good. 
The teaching force improves yearly. We have no county 
high schools, as yet, but hope to have at least two next year. 
The attendance at the monthly teachers’ meetings is good. We 
need three or four supervisors in this county. We have so many 
schools that real supervision by the County Superintendent is 
impossible. 
JuLia D. WALKER, 
County Superintendent. 
FAYETTE COUNTY. 
The school interests in Fayette County have made a steady, 
healthy improvement during the last two years. Our county 
high school at ‘Somerville and our secondary schools all over the
-P-A-G-E-508
— 485 — 
county have done most excellent work, and are on a satisfactory 
basis. Two many of our primary schools are small and must 
still suspend for cotton picking. We have urged consolidation 
as a remedy for this, but without marked success except in two 
instances. We will make a strong effort to induce the board to 
try transportation before the next term opens. We have added 
the fourth teacher to our high school and now offer the courses 
in domestic science, thus maintaining our fisrt-class standing. 
The attendance in the high school is better than it has ever been 
before. 
The Boys’ Corn Club for Fayette County has been a marked 
success. Last year in old Fayette, where it has been thought 
corn could not be grown successfully, several of our boys made 
over a hundred bushels on the acre, and one boy made 122 bush- 
els. This year the yield will be large, but as conditions for the 
season were not so favorable as last year, we hardly look for as 
great yields. It is generally agreed that no one enterprise has 
been worth more to Fayette County than the Boys’ Corn Clubs. 
We did not succeed with our Girls Tomato Clubs on account 
of the expense of the canning outfit. 
We are beginning to feel the effects of our county high school 
on our teaching force, and by the close of the present term we 
think we can get the board to agree that it will elect no new 
teacher with less than a high school diploma. Thus, we come in 
sight of a long cherished object. 
We have urged libraries with some degree of success and feel 
that an interest has been aroused and that results are in sight. 
Some of our local school improvement associations have done 
splendid work in their communities. , 
The County Board of Education has made great improvement 
in the schoolhouses of the county. 
D. K. DonNELL, 
County Superintendent. 
FRANKLIN COUNTY. 
Despite the fact that Franklin County is under the “old 
director system’’ school interest is good. Many communities 
have either built new houses or have improved the’ old ones.
-P-A-G-E-509
— 486 — 
Other communities are soon to follow suit. Each teacher in 
the county is trying to do some one thing toward improving his 
or her school during the present term. There is one set of the 
travelling libraries in the county Many schools are endeavoring 
to establish, with the aid of the State, permanent libraries. The 
County Court: raised the elementary school tax from 40 cents 
on the hundred dollars to 48 cents, and the high school tax from 
5 cents on the hundred dollars to 8 cents. There are also many 
other indications of school interest. 
An educational campaign is being carried on throughout the 
entire county, in which the following things are being emphasized : 
A twenty-five thousand dollar bond issue to build schoolhouses, 
good reads, the necessity of high schools, longer terms, the need 
of a'‘compulcory attendance law,”’ etc. 
Austin W. SMITH, 
County Superintendent. 
GIBSON COUNTY. 
In compliance with your request, I herewith submit a 
brief report supplementary to my statistical reports for the past 
two years. , 
During the past two years we have run a seven-months term 
each year. Our attendance has been fairly good, but not by 
any means ideal. The results have been fairly favorable, but 
not as great as we had hoped for. Our teachers, as a general 
thing, are interested in the school work, and in the main have 
co-operated with the County Superintendent and the County 
Board of Education to make conditions better. We have held 
many teachers’ meetings and school rallies, thus stimulating the 
zeal of our teachers and arousing greater interest among the 
people for better schools and improved educational facilities. 
Two years ago our county board fixed the minimum attend- 
ance of our schools at 17 pupils for primary and one-teacher 
schools, and 10 pupils in the secondary department, and 17 
pupils in the primary department of secondary schools, with the 
provision that in case either department fell below the minimum 
the teacher in the delinquent department should be dismissed,
-P-A-G-E-510
— 487 — 
and if both departments should fall below.the minimum the school 
should be closed for the term or till the attendance might justify 
reinstatement. : 
One year ago the board increased the minimum to 13 pupils 
in the secondary department and 18 pupils in the primary: de- 
partment of secondary schools, and 18 pupils in primary or one- 
teacher schools, with provision that in case of delinquent at- 
* tendance in either department of secondary schools that the 
primary teacher should be suspended, thus keeping the head on 
the school as long as it might continue, notifying pupils in the 
secondary department of secondary schools to quit school, or 
to be under the instruction of a-primary teacher who might not 
be able to teach secondary branches, and holding only a primary 
certificate. When the county board system. was inaugurated 
in 1907, it made the minimum 10 pupils, without reference to 
different departments. Ina short time the minimum was increased 
to 15 pupils for the school as a whole, primary or secondary. 
The board discovered that under this arrangement they might 
be employing two or three teachers to teach as few as ten or 
fifteen pupils, or they might be employing a principal to teach 
3 or 4 pupils at a salary of $50 to $75 per month. As a matter 
of economy, as well as to increase the daily attendance, they 
began to increase and differentiate the minimum average daily 
attendance. . 
The specific results of this action are: (1) The daily attendance 
has been increased in many schools; (2) the cost per pupil 
has been decreased; (3) the interest of teachers, pupils and 
patrons has been materially increased; (4) weak secondary 
schools have been strengthened, made strong primary schools, 
or entirely abandoned; (5) the desire for school consolidation 
has been heightened; (6) the abandonment of four weak colored 
primary schools and four weak white’ primary schools; (7) the 
reduction of three weak two-teacher secondary schools to one- 
teacher primary schools. 
The general results developing from this action, if properly 
and judiciously continued, will create a strong sentiment in 
favor of larger schools, better supervision, better teaching, better 
qualified teachers and a.broader and more practical course of 
study, longer terms, better facilities and better salaries for teach- 
ers. .
-P-A-G-E-511
— 488 — 
Popular sentiment for a school at each man’s door, however 
weak and poor it may be, militates much against school cen- 
tralization and pupil transportation. Bad roads also operate 
against consolidation. The County Superintendent has made 
arguments in favor of rural school consolidation, but so far 
without any visible results. 
Three years ago we began organizing Boys’ Corn Clubs in 
our school by the aid of our teachers. The first year, to encour- 
age the boys and the farmers in practical and improved farming 
and to increase the interest of boys in the study of agriculture 
in the schools as well as on the farms, we got the county board 
to donate to the boys joining the corn clubs free improved seed 
’ corn. That year we had 400 boys in the County School Boys’ 
Corn Club, and had about 400 acres planted in corn, producing 
30,000 to 40,000 bushels of corn. The two fair associations of 
the county gave $100 each in premiums. Notwithstanding the 
great impetus to improved farming throughout the county, the 
corn club interest has waned in the last two years, from the fact 
that free seed was not longer furnished the boys and one of the 
fair associations refused to offer premiums to the corn club boys, 
and the other fair association lost interest in the boys’ exhibits. 
No girls’ tomato clubs have ever been attempted in this 
county. 
Eight school libraries have been put into our schools within 
the last two years. Others are planning to put in libraries soon. 
We have attempted several times to organize school improve- 
ment societies, without any definite success. 
It seems that the most important step now to be taken is 
school consolidation, segregation and pupil transportation. 
With this accomplished, we could effect more in the matters of 
libraries, school improvement, vitalization of school courses, and 
home life and farm improvement. 
J. B. CummMinecs, 
County Superintendent. 
GILES COUNTY. 
On visiting the schools the first round two years ago and 
from the reports from the various schools I found three points
-P-A-G-E-512
— 489 — 
wherein we were woefully below what should be expected i ina 
prosperous county like this. 
First—Of the eleven thousand children of school age, more 
than three thousand never entered the schoolhouse door and less 
than half of them were in school all of the time for the short term 
of six months in the year. 
Second—The schoolhouses, inside and out, were sadly neg- 
lected. 
Third—Very \ittle interest was manifested in rural schools. 
We at once set to work to improve the conditions. The 
teachers adopted the plan of taking from the scholastic popula- 
tion the names of the pupils allotted to the various schools and 
calling this roll on the first morning of school. In this way it 
was easy to know how many were out of school and the reason 
why. This has increased the enrollment and the attendance is 
better than ever before. soe 
We have also adopted a plan of submitting written reports 
quarterly on school improvement. Every thing done by pupils 
or parents during that quarter is recorded in a book provided 
for that purpose and is kept for reference. This plan is working 
admirably in school improvement. 
We are now working to have a library in every school in the 
county. 
We have an up-to-date corn club, with good interest and 
gratifying results. 
B. H. GauLrney, 
County Superintendent, 
GREENE COUNTY. 
In attempting to review the work of the past two years, 1 
shall write freely as to what has been done, not because I have 
any desire to boast, but because it is right that you should know 
of the work done. 
In the first place, I made a thorough investigation of the 
schools, visiting every school during the 1911-12 school: term. 
I am able to locate each house, describe its condition and esti- 
mate the work of its teacher, or teachers.
-P-A-G-E-513
— 490 — 
By regular and careful institute work, I have become more 
thoroughly acquainted with the teachers and have been able 
to stimulate many to efforts for improvement. At the E. T. 
E. A. meeting in the spring of 1911, there were two teachers en- 
rolled from Greene County. In 1912, thirty-four were in actual 
attendance. Greene enrolled in the State normal school last 
year thirty-two teachers. Twice as many reading circle books 
were sold last year to teachers as in 1911, and 1911 was a large 
increase over 1910. 
The Boys’ Corn Club for Greene County was organized in 
the spring of 1911. That year one of our members secured not 
only two county prizes and one district prize, but also three 
State prizes. His prizes amounted to sixty dollars and he had 
“over a hundred bushels of corn for sale. We have thirty members 
now enrolled in the Corn Club. 
This year, we organized the Greene County School Improve- 
ment Association during our annual institute. The teachers 
promised to organize local leagues and many have already done 
so. Some have invited me to meet with the patrons and we 
have effected organizations. The local organizations have their 
library committees appointed and these, with the help of the 
‘finance and entertainment committees are planning to raise 
funds for school libraries. Some have already secured nice 
bookcases and have received sufficient donations tq begin to 
fill them. This work is just begun, but we shall push it and I 
feel confident that by the end of the school year there will be a 
good report in this particular. : 
Mrs. J. F. Kine, 
County Superintendent. 
GRUNDY COUNTY. 
In submitting my annual report I feel that much might be 
said concerning the progress we have made along educational 
lines during the past two years. 
ScHOOL IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATIONS, 
We have a county organization composed of fifty teachers. 
Several schools in the county have local organizations. Forty
-P-A-G-E-514

minutes at each monthly teachers’ meeting is given to the school 
improvement work. The reports of what has been done during 
the month is very stimulating to all the teachers, non-members 
as well as members. Our libraries and several other improve- 
ments are largely due to the influence of the School Improvement 
Association. 
Hicu ScHoot. 
I am sorry to state that we have no high school in our county. 
This will come by and by, when more of the people learn to appre- 
ciate what the high school means for the masses, and especially 
what it means for a better teaching force. 
TAXATION. 
We succeeded this year in getting our County Court to make 
a special levy of ten cents on the $100 worth of property to pro- 
long our public schools. 
ATTENDANCE. 
Our attendance for this year is more gratifying than ever 
before. In visiting the schools, I hear it said that we have better 
teachers and better attended schools than ever before. 
Corn Cius. 
We have a Boys’ Corn Club of 12. We have just begun the 
work, . . 
CONSOLIDATION. 
The physiography of our county will not admit of extensive 
consolidation of the schools. However, we have consolidated 
some few schools, and mean to continue to consolidate as far as 
practicable. 
. SUPERVISION. : 
I have been for the past two years, and am now, devoting 
my entire time to the supervision of the schools. I am spending 
more time in the school room than ever before. :

HAMBLEN COUNTY. 
I hereby submit the following report of school conditions in 
Hamblen County: 
During the past two years I have visited every school in 
the county at least three or four times. 
Conditions are by no means what they should be. The 
per cent of attendance is now a little higher than the average for 
the State, but we yet have hundreds of boys and girls who do not 
attend school. School conditions here, as in many other coun- 
ties of the State, call loudly for a general compulsory school law, 
and a body of school officers who have the moral courage to en- 
force it. 
I attribute the lack of attendance in Hamblen County to 
these causes: indifference of parents; inefficiency of teachers; 
desolate, dilapidated and repulsive condition of school buildings ; 
antiquated course of study. : 
LIBRARIES. 
I have made this one subject the special feature of my work. 
When I came. into office in 1911, I found in our rural schools 
two small libraries. I immediately took up the work of estab- 
lishing others. At present more than sixty per cent of our schools 
have libraries, ranging in value from ten dollars to one hundred 
doilars each. Most all of our teachers are interested in the 
matter and are working to secure funds. At the present rate it 
will not be long till every school in Hamblen County will have a 
library. Wherever we have established these libraries, we have 
improved school interest and the school spirit both among 
patrons and pupils. 
BUILDINGS. | 
The worst feature of school conditions in Hamblen County 
is our buildings, but I will say here that they are as.good as the 
average. Last year we erected three new buildings, two of 
them being built on modern plans. Not more than one-third 
of our schoolhouses are fit for children to livé in. Many of 
them are old and dilapidated, insanitary, dust covered, germ~ 
ridden, disease breeding holes that ought not to stand in a civil- 
ized community.
-P-A-G-E-516
— 493 — 
CONSOLIDATION. 
In the past two years we have consolidated only two schools. 
Probably no county in the State is better situated for the con- 
solidation of its schools than Hamblen, but for lack of funds we - 
have made slow progress in this feature of school work. . 
However, the school Board is interested in the work of con- 
solidation, and we shall soon take up the matter with a determi- 
nation to put it into active operation. 
Corn CLuss. 
Last March, at the suggestion of Supt. Brister, and by the aid 
of the special agent of the Department of Agriculture, we or- 
ganized a Boys’ Corn Club, having a membership of fifty, but 
on account of the backward season and the heavy rains, not more 
than thirty of these boys entered the contest. 
We have secured by subscription about three hundred dol- 
lars for local prizes. : 
The boys are enthusiastic in their work. We feel sure that 
this organization means much for agricultural interest, and for 
the practical education of the boy on the farm. 
TEACHING FoRCE. , 
This year about half of our teachers attended school, the 
greater part of them going to the Johnson City State Normal 
School. As a result, they are doing much better work. 
They are organized into a Teachers’ Association, which meets 
every month of the year for the purpose of pursuing some course 
of study. The teachers of this county are, as a rule, thoroughly 
alive to their work; however, we yet have a few “time markers,”’ 
but the days of such are numbered, unless they fall into the pro- 
cession and march with the spirit of the times. 
In conclusion, I would say that while it seems that our schools 
make slow progress, never has there been such an- awakening on 
the part of our people in school interest; never has there been 
such a demand on the part of our citizens for better school -facili- 
ties, for better buildings, better teachers, and more sanitary 
surroundings; never has there been more enthusiastic leadership
-P-A-G-E-517
— 494 — 
on the part of the teacher nor more loyal co-operation on the 
part of the parent and the pupil. 
Out of these conditions is fast coming a better day for the 
rural schdéol. 
J. D. Sexr, 
County Superintendent. 
HAMILTON COUNTY. 
We are glad to report that the public schools of Hamilton 
County have steadily advanced in efficiency during the past 
year. 
The general interest of the public has been pronounced, the 
response of the County Court to the demands for improved 
school facilities in buildings and equipment as well as for in- 
creased appropriations for the maintenance of the schools, the 
increased interest and activity of the teachers have excelled that 
- of any previous year. 
- BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT. 
A recent loan of $160,000.00 to be provided for out of a bond 
issue in 1918, was made by the County Court to provide for the 
erection and equipment of thirteen additional school buildings, 
all of which will be completed and occupied by January 1, 1913. 
This makes a total of forty new school buildings for the. county 
in five years, at a total cost of $595,000.00. Additional buildings 
will be provided for during next year. The general public is so 
aroused to the importance of the school work, that there is scarce- 
ly a note of complaint to be heard against the large investments 
that are being made in schools, for itis an investment. Hamilton 
County never invested any money in its public institutions that 
has brought such large returns in a material way, to say nothing 
of the return in human character and increased earning power, 
which means comfort, happiness and contentment. 
AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT. 
While the Department of Agriculture in the rural high schools 
has had a struggle, it is steadily growing in favor with the general
-P-A-G-E-518
— 495 —~ 
public. The farmers are becoming more willing to accept the 
suggestions of trained men as to better methods in the treat- 
ment of the soil and the cultivation of crops. Those who have 
seen fit to adopt the better methods, have produced results that 
are alone sufficient to warrant the expenditures in this depart- 
ment. The demonstrations of these men are plain and convinc- 
ing, and the next five years will mark a progress that will indeed 
be a source of wealth and power to our whole community. 
Corn Cuuss. 
For four years there have been conducted corn club contests 
among the boys of the rural high schools. The number enrolling 
each year has increased and the average yield has been remark- - 
ably good. The largest yield of corn for any one of the members 
of the club this year was 13414 bushels per acre. The yield in 
onions was 550 bushels per acre. The yield in potatoes, soy 
beans, cow peas and tomatoes is equally as gratifying. 
Home Economics. 
Home economics and domestic science constitute a part of 
the course in all the five high schools, and in the combined high 
and grammar schools, the girls of the 6th, 7th and 8th grades 
have enjoyed the advantages of these departments. Cutting, 
sewing, fitting and fancy work are also being done in a number 
of the grammar schools of the county by the regular teachers in 
charge. 
CANNING AND PouLTRY CLUBs. 
Canning and poultry clubs have been organized in all of the 
tural high schools. The work has been done in accordance ;with 
instructions of the Government department. A large number 
of girls and boys enrolled in this department during the spring 
of 1912. While only a few. were successful in carrying out the 
instructions in their entirety, there was a sufficient number to 
demonstrate clearly and forcibly the great benefits to be derived, 
both to the children and to the homes. A record of 1,174 cans 
of fruit and vegetables canned by one girl was a revelation. The 
interest and enthusiasm that is manifested by the children and 
their parents is indicative of great results for next year.
-P-A-G-E-519
— 496 — 
For the boys and girls of the suburban schools where the cul- 
tivation of one-tenth of an acre prescribed by the Government 
Demonstration Department was not practicable, clubs were 
organized in the respective grammar schools for the cultivation of 
twelve tomato plants. Reports of some very successful work 
have been made. 
Breap MAKING. 
The department that is distinctly new in the South, is the 
Department of Bread Making. Bread making clubs: were or- 
ganized under the direction of two capable public spirited women. 
The public exhibit of bread, cakes and candies prepared by the 
girls of rural and suburban Grammar and High Schools, was 
simply a wonder. 
The interest and enthusiasm of these girls has been remarkable, 
but this interest does not cease with them. Their mothers 
have become interested, and are clamoring for an organization. 
of their own, that they, too, may know how to make more whole- 
some bread for their families, and that they may assist and 
encourage their girls. 
ORGANIZED PLay. 
In recognition of the educational value of play, and of its 
potency as a means of securing regular and prompt ‘attendance, 
as well as its‘disciplinary value, a supervisor of play grounds was 
placed in charge of the out-door activities of the suburban 
‘schools. Under the general direction of the supervisor, the teach- 
ers co-operating, baseball, football, country ball and basket-ball 
teams were organized, and competitive games were scheduled 
and played among the schools. . Under this system of organized 
play, the student body was divided into groups and played games 
adapted to their age and physical endurance. The benefits 
soon became apparent to patrons generally, and as a result, 
. through the efforts of the school improvement associations, play 
ground equipment has been added to the majority of the suburban 
schools. . 
MeEpIcat INSPECTION. 
The Department of Medical Inspection in the county schools 
has rendered a great service to the cause of education. Pam-
-P-A-G-E-520
—497— : 
phlets containing instructions in sanitation, hygiene and physi- 
ology are placed in the hands of teachers for their guidance. Sep- 
arate periods are devoted to the subject of health, etc., each week. 
Packages of ‘First Aid to the Injured” are in charge of some 
competent teacher, who takes care of all cases of headache, 
toothache, cuts, bruises or other sickness. The relief offered to 
the suffering, and the prevention of loss of time from school to 
them, are of tremendous consequence, not only to the welfare of 
the individual, but to the organization of the school as a whole. 
Sanitary drinking fountains have been installed by the School 
Improvement Association. 
MANUAL TRAINING DEPARTMENT. 
The work of the Manual Training Department has been a 
great stimulus to the general school interest, and has attracted 
many of the most capable young men. The course has steadily 
increased in popularity and in numbers. The manufacturers 
and business men have taken a deep interest in this department, 
and through their co-operation with the head of this department, 
have helped to secure employment for manual training students 
during Saturdays and vacation days. This has made it possible 
for a number of the young men to earn means by which they have 
been enabled to continue in school for a full four year high school 
course. Manual training for the boys in the upper grammar 
grades now being provided in a limited way in some of our schools, 
is to be made a regular feature of the course of study in all the 
grammar schools.

HANCOCK COUNTY. 
‘In compliance with your request I hereby submit a report of 
the school system of my county for the years 1911-1912. 
During the past year our schools have made permanent pro- 
gress. Finding ourselves without the funds to erect the neces- 
sary school buildings during the year, we went before the County
-P-A-G-E-521
— 498 — 
Court and procured a bond issue to be used in repairing, equip- 
ping and erecting buildings. From these funds five new build- 
ings have been erected and fifteen hundred dollars worth of 
desks purchased. Other buildings will be constructed as fast 
as the board can make satisfactory arrangements. 
Where physical conditions will permit we expect from two to 
four schools to be combined into a consolidated graded school. 
This is the first county in this section to issue bonds for rural 
schools, and we wish to say that we have found the bond issue 
very satisfactory, and a great relief to the present financial con- 
dition. 
While our county high school is yet in its experimental stage, 
its work has exceeded our expectations in training teachers and 
helping to raise the standard of education. Last year our high 
school turned out five graduates. There are about fifteen in 
the 1913 class. 
Much progress has been made in securing the co-operation of 
the teachers in grading the schools. The students now realize 
that there is a goal to reach each year, and they are working hard 
for promotion. 
Our Teachers’ Association has been very active during the 
year and has done much to improve conditions. It has stimu- 
lated a school spirit and has been the means of raising much 
money for repairs, furniture, library, etc. 
The educational rally conducted by Prof. Harry Clark had a 
marked influence on our people. It aroused enthusiasm in the 
patrons as well as teachers. A large flag was offered to the 
school securing the largest number of students and patrons 
present. A smaller was given the school in each board district 
securing the largest number of students and patrons. The 
school having the largest per cent of its enrollment present was 
given a nice chart. Suitable presents were given the best repre- 
sented school in each civil district. The capital prize was won 
by the Davis-Chapel School, seven miles from the county site. 
Our people are very anxious to see the school’s proportion of 
the State’s revenue raised from twenty-five to thirty-three and a 
third per cent, and so proportioned that the common and high 
schools of weak counties be given more substantial aid. We 
have had our candidates for the Legislature pledged to the same.

The above is a general synopsis of the special work done in 
the county during the year. It has been our aim to raise the 
standard of teachers and improve the general condition of the 
schools, and we feel that this part of the work has not been a 
failure. When the next Legislature enacts our general codifica- 
tion bill, revises our courses of study and gives us our much- 
needed raise in revenue, the scope of our work will be greatly 
broadened and progress will be more marked. 
M. E. TEsTERMAN, 
County Superintendent. 
HARDIN COUNTY. 
Hardin County shows some improvement all along the line 
over last year. Both the enrollment and average daily attend- 
ance are the largest in the history of the county. This is very: 
gratifying when we consider that our scholastic population is . 
the smallest it has been for many years. In 1901 it was 7,211, 
but it has gradually receded till to-day it is only 5,948. 
Our enrollment for the year ending June 30, 1912, was 5,231, 
as against the previous record of 4,810 in 1910. Our average 
daily attendance for the year was 3,141 as against 3,035 in 1910. 
Our average daily attendance would have been much higher had 
we not had the roughest winter experienced for many years; 
as it was, our average daily attendance was 52 per cent of the 
scholastic population, which was better than that for the State. 
This increase is partly accounted for because of the fact that we 
have a compulsory school law in force in Hardin County. 
Along the line of school building, repairing and furnishing, we 
have done much.- Eleven new houses have been built and eight 
additional rooms have been constructed. Thirty-two houses 
have been seated. The building was done cheaply. The people 
in the community did more than half the work. 
Hardin County bids farewell to its last log school house. A 
neat frame structure was erected last fall in the place of the 
Mountain View log house, which was the last in the county. 
We need a bond issue for building purposes, and must have 
it or suffer. -

The present superintendent was elected in August to a term 
of 4 years as superintendent, thus giving him a term sufficiently 
long to plan and carry into effect his planning. By an act of 
the Legislature of 1911, the people of Hardin County elect the 
superintendent by a direct vote for a term of 4 years. We hope 
that we will be able to do something all along the line for educa- 
tion in the next 4 years. Consolidation, transportation, normal 
trained teachers and a general educational awakening are some 
of the improvements sought for. 
C. A. Lows, 
County Superintendent. 
HAWKINS COUNTY.» 
School conditions in Hawkins County have shown marked 
improvement in the past two years. The improvement has been 
found, mainly, in the qualification and work of the teachers, 
the interest of school patrons and the real education of the pupils. 
TEACHING FORCE. 
We have a larger number of teachers than formerly, andthe 
improvement in the work done in the schools has been gratifying. 
We had a number of large schools with one teacher trying to do 
the work of two teachers. This bad condition has been remedied 
by repairing and building additional rooms to some houses, and 
putting two teachers in charge of such schools. The results have 
pleased school officials, patrons and pupils. 
We have a splendid body of teachers, and the work in most 
of the schools has been excellent, yet the pressing need in our 
county to-day is better qualified and better paid teachers. The 
salary scale for teachers has been agreed upon, and we are now 
paying them according to their scholarship and experience. As 
long as service rendered is satisfactory, salaries will be increased. 
Last year we had 44 teachers in the East Tennessee Normal 
School, and we hope to have a larger number there this year.

ScHoo, PRopPERTY. 
In nearly all of our communities, schoolhouses are comfortable, 
but about one-third of our houses are not equipped with desks 
and other modern school furniture. However, we are putting 
desks in houses as rapidly as possible. During the past two 
years we have placed desks in ten schoolhouses, erected three 
up-to-date houses, and repaired others. We have used all the 
money we could in this way, without diminishing the length of 
the school term. 
CONSOLIDATION. 
While our number of schools has been greatly reduced by © 
consolidation, we have not done much within the past two 
years for lack of funds to locate and erect new. buildings. How- 
ever, we have planned to consolidate more schools next year. 
- ENROLLMENT AND ATTENDANCE. 
The report of the enrollment and attendance last year showed 
a decrease from the report of the previous year, but I think mis- 
takes were made in reports from teachers. I am sure that our 
enrollment and attendance has increased each year since the 
compulsory school law took effect. Reports from teachers this 
year show that schools are better attended than ‘ever before. 
ScHooL TERM. 
Our school term is six months, and we hope to make it seven 
months next year. Our terms have been five, five and one-half 
and six months for several years. We could have had longer 
terms, had not the building and furnishing of schoolhouses been 
absolutely necessary. 
ScHOOL IMPROVEMENT. 
Our teachers have raised $1,435.24 as the proceeds of enter- 
tainments, box-suppers, etc., and this amount has been expended 
in improving houses and beautifying schoolrooms.

HicH ScHoo.. 
We have been busy for the past year working for a county 
high school, and I believe that with a little more work our County 
Court will make a tax levy for us next spring. A committee 
has been appointed by the court to make a report at the January 
term in regard to the purchase of the Rogersville Synodical 
College building for this purpose. 
- . Corn Cups. 
We have a fine Boys’ Corn Club, and hope to win some State 
prizes. Last year, Zeb Sanders, of this county, won two prizes 
in the East Tennessee contest. 
C. H. RicHarpson, 
County Superintendent. 
HAYWOOD COUNTY. 
The public schools of Haywood County are now in better 
condition than ever before in their history. We have a live, 
energetic board, ever ready to co-operate, with the superintend- 
ent in everything looking to the betterment of educational con- 
ditions. : 
Our school term has been lengthened to eight months. 
Teachers’ salaries have been increased and now range from $40.00 
to $75.00 per month. Several new buildings have been erected 
during the past year and many old buildings have been improved 
and equipped with new furniture. Our teaching force is the 
best we have ever had, and the work being done by them is of an 
unusually satisfactory nature. In some sections of the county 
schools have to be dismissed for a few weeks during the cotton 
picking season. For the present this seems unavoidable, though 
much to be deplored. 
We are working for consolidation with some success and trust 
that the days of one-teacher schools in Haywood County are 
numbered. The greatest drawback to consolidation here is bad 
roads. Our school rally held on October 3 was largely attended 
and its good results are already being seen. Our finances are in. 
good shape. We have no indebtedness.

We desire to thank the State Superintendent and his excellent 
corps of assistants for what we believe to be one of the most 
practical, systematic and successful: administrations of our 
public school system that Tennessee has ever had. 
F. R. Oaitvis, 
County Superintendent. 
HENDERSON COUNTY. 
In reply to your letter of a day or so since will state that our 
schools have made some progress during the past two years. 
There is a growing spirit in the county for consolidation of the 
schools, and the county board is doing some work in that direc- 
tion. We are offering.an inducement for the benefit of the 
schools in the community for local work in that line. Asa result, 
some are taking advantage of that feature of improvement. 
There is a growing desire for the application of compulsory 
education. I am preparing to take up the corn club movement. 
My high school interest is good. Practically all of the op- 
position to it has passed and the country people are taking ad- 
vantage of it. I can see in my rural schools the great result of 
having that institution on a permanent basis. Those who for- 
merly opposed it are coming to favor it. You remember I have 
the only compulsory high school in the State. 
The small attendance, small and poorly equipped school- 
houses, lack of sufficient funds, are the principal weaknesses of 
our schools at this time. 
: W. H. DENIson, 
County Superintendent. 
HICKMAN COUNTY. 
Iam sending my report, which I hope is correct. 
The last Legislature passed a law creating a board of trustees 
in each school district. This law is causing much confusion 
among the schools of this county. |
-P-A-G-E-527
~— 504 — 
The 1911 and 1912 State institutes held in Centreville have 
greatly increased the efficiency of our teachers. The teachers 
are putting into practice the things learned at these meetings. 
Fairview is furnishing us a good lot of teachers. 
There is a growing sentiment here for consolidation, which is 
badly needed. Our county board is composed of men who are 
in favor of fewer and better schools. a 
The daily attendance is far from satisfactory. Experience 
shows that this condition can be improved by consolidation. 
I am ashamed to report only ten permanent libraries, but I 
hope to see a library in every school in the near future. The 
six traveling libraries are doing a wonderful work. They are 
not only creating a love for reading among the children, but also 
among the parents. . 
We are in debt for bridges, and our County Court will not 
talk about a high school or a bond isstie, but there is growing 
sentiment here for a high school, and I think it will be but a short 
time till we have one. 
: G. C, Harviit, 
County Superintendent. 
HUMPHREYS COUNTY. 
The schools of Humphreys County have improved steadily 
during the last two years, but not as much as they should, or as 
we would like. We believe there is a better school spirit through- 
out the county than formerly. 
Two years ago the minimum salary paid our teachers was 
$30.00 per month, and the maximum $50.00; now the minimum 
is $35.00 and the maximum $65.00. This increase serves to 
hold our best teachers and furnish a greater inducement to them 
to attend the State Normal. Our teaching force is twenty-five 
per cent stronger in efficiency than it was two years ago. 
Our school improvement work has been gratifying. Last year 
about $2,000 worth of school improvement work was done. 
This was without cost to the county board. ’ 
Our libraries have been steadily increasing and their effect on 
the schools has been marked.
-P-A-G-E-528
— 505 — 
Three new houses have been erected at a cost of $3,500, at 
places where consolidation was not possible. 
The graded course of study has been put into our schools, and 
we are succeeding fairly well with it. 
We have been, and are still, working for a school bond issue 
with which to build and equip schoolhouses. It is our purpose 
to consolidate several schools the coming year, but it will be 
necessary to have more funds with which to build these houses’ 
when the consolidation has been effected. We are also looking 
toward one or more high schools in the county, but we realize 
we cannot procure all of these at once. So we are stressing most 
_ a bond issue, and consolidation with transportation where needed. 
. But our greatest immediate need is a compulsory attendance 
law; we believe our county is not only ready but anxious for it. 
W. L. RocHELLE, 
County Superintendent. 
JACKSON COUNTY. 
Your letter asking for information concerning the present 
conditions and needs of schools of our county to hand. 
In reply will say that our attendance record is most unsatis- 
factory. Children are kept from school to do farm work, and in 
busy seasons our schools upon an average fall below 50 per cent 
of enrollment and some weeks schools have to be suspended. 
The result is that by the time the work is finished the term is 
so nearly over that those who drop out do not return. When the 
schools are located on water courses, it makes it very inconven- 
ient for winter schools. A continuous fall term in such cases 
seems unwise, as we are compelled to run the latter half with 
about thirty-five per cent of the enroilment. 
We have organized the teachers into a Teachers’ Improve- . 
ment Association. We have had .some success in securing 
beautiful, comfortable and sanitary conditions. 
We have a number of libraries in this county and are working 
for others. 
I am planning some consolidations for next year which I am 
sure ought to be effected. We are planning also the organization 
of a corn club.
-P-A-G-E-529
— 506 — 
Our teaching force is not what'it should be by any means, 
but if we make some consolidations next year, I think we can 
find a sufficient number: of competent teachers in our county for 
most positions. 
I would like to consider the high school proposition on Tues- 
day of the January court. I want all the help you can give me, 
and information concerning the high schools of other counties 
of the State. 
J. F. Gaines, . 
County Superintendent. 
JAMES COUNTY. 
Our schools last year did well, considering our inexperienced 
teaching force, and our attendance was 20 per cent better than 
the previous year. . 
Our institute was a success. The primary instructor was an 
inspiration to our teachers. Prof. C. J. Doub did. splendid 
work for us as instructor in history, etc., and he is doing our 
county much good by his faithful work as high school principal. 
We have only one county high school and one 20-room boarding 
hall just about complete. : 
Our examinations this year were rather rigid and. some 
failed. 
We have all our schools equipped with good seats. I have 
just ordered ‘globes, maps and single seats for all unfurnished 
schools to the amount of $700.00. 
Now, as all our schools are furnished and comfortable, I am 
in favor of a State-wide compulsory school law for at least three 
months in the year for all pupils over seven and a half years ~ 
and under sixteen, and a rigid enforcement of the cigar and 
cigarette law. 
The future citizenship of our State and nation depends upon 
the enforcement of wholesome laws.

JOHNSON COUNTY. 
The schools of Johnson County are improving, and in the 
last two years the improvement has been very marked. The 
people have become deeply interested and are demanding better 
school work. 
We are making a special effort to improve our wr teaching force, 
and we have made some steps forward in that direction. 
We need better equipment and we need a special fund for 
this purpose. Our schools have been shortened the last two 
years on account of building houses out of the school fund. 
We are putting special effort on consolidation, and we have . 
one of the best school buildings just completed to be found any- 
where. It is a consolidated school and the patrons are very 
much pleased with the outlook. 
There are two or three very fine propositions for consolida- 
tion that we expect to work out in the next two years. When we 
get our consolidation plans worked out, Johnson, County will be 
second to none in the State for good schools. 
Our libraries are coming along slowly but steadily. 
Corn clubs will be started right at once. We have the plans 
about completed. 
School improvement work started out very nicely about 
two years ago, but the loss of its leaders gave it a set back that 
it has not recovered from yet. 
The superintendent has too much detail and office work to 
do and not near enough time to supervise the schools. That is a 
trouble that needs remedying very much in Johnson County. 
Taking everything into consideration, the school outlook in 
Johnson County is very encouraging. 
F. C. DouGuerty, 
County Superintendent. 
KNOX COUNTY. 
It is very gratifying to report that the schools of Knox 
County have made considerable progress during the past two 
years. During this time the school revenues of the county,
-P-A-G-E-531
— 508 — 
not including cities, have been increased from $90,000.00 to 
$121,000.00. As a result of this increase in revenues and of 
school consolidation, the salaries of teachers have been raised 
and the school term has been lengthened from six and one-half 
months to eight months. 
CONSOLIDATION. 
Two years ago there were 270 teachers employed in the schools 
of Knox County, not including those of the city and high schools ; 
248 white and 22 colored. There were 147 school buildings. 
Fifty-eight of these were one-room buildings in which one 
. teacher was employed to teach the school. The remainder com- 
prised two or more rooms in which were employed two or more 
teachers. . 
Through consolidation the number of teachers has been re- 
duced to 256; 234 white and 22 colored. The number of one- 
room schools has been reduced to 44. 
Consolidation has promoted the grading of the schools and 
‘better preparation of pupils for the high schools. 
In the Second School District two buildings were abandoned 
and the schools were consolidated in a ‘new ten-room brick 
building. This building, with equipment, cost a little less 
than $10,000.00." This is considered the best grammar school 
building in East Tennessee out side of an incorporated town. 
TEACHERS’ MEETINGS. 
The teachers of the county are organized under the name of 
“The Knox County Teachers’ Association.’”” Ten meetings are 
held each year. Reading circle texts were used during the past 
two years and the recitations were conducted by Dean Hoskins 
and Prof. Mulvania, of the University of Tennessee. These 
meetings were largely attended and much interest manifested. 
RALLIES. 
A series of two rallies for each school district was held each 
year. In these rallies the superintendent was assisted by the 
State Superintendent, State Inspectors of the Elementary and 
High Schools, members of the faculty of the University of
-P-A-G-E-532
— 509 — 
Tennessee, and other citizens of the county interested in the 
campaign for better schools. . 
SUMMER SCHOOL OF THE SOUTH. 
In lieu of a county institute, the teachers of the county are 
required to attend the Summer School of the South, which is 
held annually for six weeks at the University of Tennessee. 
More than two thousand teachers attend this school from almost 
all states in the Union. . 
HIGH SCHOOLS. 
There are at present two first-class high schools in Knox 
County, the Central High School at Fountain City, and the 
Farragut High School near Concord. The county has issued 
high school. bonds for the establishment of two or more high 
schools. In these new high schools the subject of agriculture 
and home economics will be emphasized and a supervisor has 
already been employed to organize and direct the work. 
Monroe W. WILson, 
County Superintendent. 
LAUDERDALE COUNTY. 
Inclosed herewith please find my report for the school ‘year 
past. 
You may observe that the average term is not so long as it 
was the preceding year; this is not due to any change in the plan 
of our work, but mainly to the floods that swept the districts 
that border the Mississippi River. 
The consolidated and central schools are now the most at- 
tractive feature of our work, though they have some opposition. 
Nearly all my school work, worth the while, is done in these 
schools. 
During my seven years experience, and as far beyond that 
time as I can find records, not one child has ever completed the 
eighth grade except in these schools. There are fourteen of 
these schools in the county, situated about four or five miles
-P-A-G-E-533
— 510 — 
apart and are open not less than eight months in the year. Our 
schools are limited by neither district nor corporation lines, but 
are all in one county system, so that when the attendance in any 
one of the small schools run down, the remnant of children left 
may attend any of the central schools, either town or country. 
By this arrangement the central schools continue to grow and to 
give better houses, better instruction and cheaper tuition. 
The greatest difficulty with which we are contending is irregu- 
lar and non-attendance. Our county board at its July meeting 
- voted unanimously in favor of a compulsory attendance law. 
The reports of the district enumerators show that there are 
in this county 313 white people over ten years old who can not 
read and write. I have divided these by districts and am plan- 
ning’ to hold some educational meetings in the districts showing 
the greatest number of illiterates. I have a plan also by which 
I hope to reduce the illiteracy among these who are over school 
age. : 
With all our impediments and weak places I feel that we are 
doing some real school work, that we have one of the best sys- 
tems anywhere and that our prospects are brightening all the 
time. 
Our three ‘county high schools are doing good work and are 
uniformly satisfactory in every way. It seems to me that our 
secondary course of study, being a deformed course any way, 
‘should either be abandoned, and turned over to the high schools, 
or made to comply with the first two years of high sthool work. 
G. G. McLEop, 
County Superintendent. 
LEWIS COUNTY. 
Inasmuch as the regular form for the annual report is silent 
on many of the most important phases of rural supervision, I 
make this brief additional statement. 
The aim in supervision has been to provide better houses, 
secure better teachers, insure better attendance, and cut down 
the number of schools.
-P-A-G-E-534
— 511 — 
The ten thousand dollar bond issue for building and equip- 
ping the rural houses, will put each house in a good state of re- 
pair, and provide a comfortable seat for each child. 
About the greatest hindrance to’ the upbuilding of the teach- 
ing force is the inability to keep our best teachers. It is to be 
hoped that we will soon begin to import good teachers, or at 
least, go out of the export business. I believe a good county 
high school will do much to better our teaching force. / 
There is a growing demand for a good compulsory attendance 
law in this county, and the next Legislature will, in all probabili- 
ty, be asked to pass one. We believe that it will do much to 
solve the attendance problem. 
Our people do not take well to the idea of consolidation. 
However, we hope by consolidating a few schools in localities 
where the propriety of this move is most apparent, to demon- 
strate the adaptation of this move and create a sentiment in its 
favor. Inasmuch as we are making many repairs at this time, 
we are cautious about spending money on houses that are located 
at. points where they are not convenient to the pupils attending. 
It is the opinion of the superintendent that the Advisory 
Board should have full power in the selection of a teacher, and 
that the county board should fix the salary, and control the 
school funds. Many citizens of this county are opposed to the 
County Board of Education, and as this opposition has arisen 
in most instances from the failure of the board to hire a favorite 
teacher, a degree of harmony might be brought about by local 
selection of the teacher. 
* Joun A. WHITE, 
County Superintendent. 
LINCOLN COUNTY. 
At your request I make the following report: 
We have done more new building this year than ever before 
.and as much, or more, repairing. In the new building the people 
have almost every time contributed one-half of the expense and 
on the repair work they have also helped. With all this help, 
the building draws heavily upon the public fund. I am, there-
-P-A-G-E-535
— 512 — 
fore, going to ask the County Court to levy a special building 
tax and still ask each locality to help in the building of houses. 
We are getting the buildings in most parts of the county in good 
condition. : 
T have just taken the graded course of study of the State, 
together with the county high course of study, and have pre- 
pared a course of study fo the schools of the county, adding 
supplementary work in each grade. I think that by having a* 
uniform course for the county it will be helpful in many ways. 
Our attendance has been much better this year, up to this 
time. We-are still making twenty the minimum for one teacher 
and forty for two. While for certain reasons I regretted to do 
it, I encouraged the schools in the cotton section of the county 
to dismiss for seven weeks for gathering crops at the end of three 
months and finish the term after the vacation. By doing this 
.the attendance was much better up to that time. Now it re- 
mains for us to rally the forces to get them together after the 
vacation is over. Many of the schools would have been 
stopped on account of the attendance and I believe that it will 
be more uniform to close them at the same time and reopen them 
at the same time. By doing this, I hope to have most of them 
to close at the same time, and give uniform examinations from 
the office to all who complete the courses. 
Thirty-six‘ boys joined the corn club and twenty-four girls 
‘joined the tomato club. J made up, altogether for the boys and 
the girls, about $280.00 in prizes. We have already had the 
girls’ contest. We will have the boys’ show Saturday, November 
2. While many of the boys and girls fell by the wayside and did 
not try at all, it seems, some have made excellent results. One 
of the girls made 1,871 pounds of tomatoes on the tenth of an 
acre. The best yield of corn reported to date is 92 bushels and 
46 pounds. Interest seems to be growing in the club work. 
Since September, 1911, we have established thirteen libraries, 
and have used very successfully six of the traveling libraries of 
the State. About ten years ago the directors of the “various 
schools of the county bought libraries for many of the schools. 
These were altogether unsuited for the children who were ex-= 
pected to use them, and consequently, they have been destroyed 
in many places and a general distaste for public school libraries

created in most of the communities of the county. A condition 
like this, I believe, is more difficult to overcome than if there 
had never been a library in the county. 
Since July I have visited all of the white schools of the 
county (some of them several times), except one, and most of 
the negro schools, and it seems to me that about all is being done 
that we could reasonably expect. 
There is a growing demand for the extension of high schools 
in the county. I think that we should have four more, one for 
each of the five divisions of the county. I shall appreciate your 
suggestions and help in the work in Lincoln County. 
JessE Harbin, 
' County Superintendent, 
McNAIRY COUNTY. 
Our enrollment makes a good showing, being about 85 per 
cent of the scholastic population, but the attendance is not so 
good. We are handicapped in this county by the insisting on 
summer terms. At this season there are many things in the way 
of attendance—protracted meetings, singing schools, fodder 
pulling and cotton picking at the close of the term. These are 
some of the causes of poor attendance. 
We erected three good schoolhouses this year, taking the place 
of old ones. The town of Adamsville replaced their wooden 
structure with a $5,000 brick. We have spent over $1,500 on 
patent seats, and have about all the houses seated. 
I will forward you in a few days a statement covering the 
progress made and showing conditions in general. 
TERRY ABERNATHY,

MACON COUNTY. 
The average salaries of teachers has been raised during last 
five years about $5.00, and we have thereby improved our 
teaching force. 
uw

Two years ago we had no libraries in the county at all, now 
we have six and money for four or five more, which will make 
twelve before January. We have also organized a Boys’ Corn 
Club for Macon County, and are planning to have a high school 
next year. 
Our attendance is not what it ought to be. I have been 
having appointments and talking to the patrons at every oppor- 
tunity, in an effort to get them to co-operate with the teacher. 
Where I have gotten them out to talk to them I have been fairly 
successful in getting them to co-operate. 
The consolidation proposition has been discussed at every 
meeting of the teachers, but the sentiment is not sufficient to 
warrant us to do much with.it yet. We are thinking of experi- 
menting next year in one of the eastern districts and if it proves 
satisfactory. we will extend it to the other parts of the county. 
The physical condition of the county and the poor roads is a 
obstacle to the success of the consolidation movement in our 
county. 
H. H. Howser, 
County Superintendent. 
MARION COUNTY. 
The progress of the Marion County public schools for the 
past year, everything considered, has been satisfactory, and it 
can be truthfully said that they have progressed. Two years 
ago, there were a number of private schools in the county in a 
flourishing condition, including two secondary schools, but now 
there are none but public schools. The County High School 
has enrolled more students than all the former secondary schools, 
private and public. The good service rendered by the public 
schools has done away with the necessity for private schools. 
The public schools, however, are just now entering into a thrifty 
growth. Consolidation is giving better schools and more com- 
modious buildings, and after a few years, this work will have 
wrought wonders in our public schools. We are asking for a 
bond issue for the purpose of building schoolhouses,.and we have 
strong hopes of securing this at the next term of court, and, if
-P-A-G-E-540
— 515 — 
we should, the scheme of consolidation may be worked out en- 
tirely next year. 
The new public interest in schools is demanding a higher 
standard of efficiency among teachers. This is being satisfied 
to a degree by our high school, and other agencies. - The average 
salary for teachers has been raised $10.00 per month within the 
past few years, 
The work of placing libraries in the public schools is well 
under way, and in a short time a large number of our schools 
will be equipped with libraries. 
A Boys’ Corn Club has been organized, and we expect to 
have one of the best clubs in the State next year. 
ALAN S. KELLY, 
County Superintendent. 
MARSHALL COUNTY. 
In accordance with your request, I take great pleasure in 
submitting in connection with my annual report, a few facts 
concerning the schools of Marshall County, and to make some 
suggestions relative to our public school system. 
By an examination of my report, you will find that we have 
fewer and better schools; ionger terms and better equipped 
schoolhouses; more efficient and better paid teachers. The in- 
terest has increased to the extent that the attendance is greater, 
while our scholastic population has decreased. 
We have placed libraries in some of the leading schools of 
the county and are planning to make arrangements by which 
every child in the county can have access to a good library. 
While our people are interested in the improvement of their 
farms, they are slow in organizing corn clubs and tomato clubs. 
We hope to create an interest in these things later on.. 
We have, with the co-operation of the patrons interested, 
improved a number of our school buildings, and have furnished 
the same with modern equipment. : 
There should be some needed legislation relative to our public 
school sys em. We should have a modified compulsory attend- 
ance law, a State uniform examination of teachers, the County
-P-A-G-E-541
— 516 — 
Board of Education and the County Superintendent should be 
elected by the County Court for a term of four years (no member 
of the court should be permitted to vote for a near kinsman), 
the scholastic population should be taken: every two years, and 
the enumerators should be appointed by the County Superin- 
tendent. There are a number of other changes that might be 
suggested, but the above mentioned changes I deem very im- 
portant. . 
In concluding this report, I wish to state that our finances are 
in excellent condition. A school warrant on Marshall County 
is worth face value at any bank in the county, and has been so 
for a number of years. 
J. G. Stinson, 
County Superintendent. 
MAURY COUNTY. 
In reply to your request for a statement in regard to the 
school conditions in Maury County, I beg to submit the fol- 
lowing: 
. The public schools occupy a more prominent place in the 
minds of the people of the county to-day than ever before. 
The two school rallies held under the auspices of your office at 
Columbia and Mt Pleasant, August 26 and 28, were followed 
by five others in different parts of the county during the first 
week of September. Prof. Harry Clark and Prof. C. A. Keffer, 
both of the University of Tennessee, were with us during this 
campaign. All the rallies were well attended, show ng the]in- 
terest which the people are taking in their schools. 
LipRARIES. 
In the statement sent out from your office June 1, 1912, 
Maury County leads the other counties of the State with 51 
public school libraries. Several have been added since that date. 
We now have one travelling library of six sets in use among the 
schools.

CONSOLIDATION. 
. The Williamsport and Sawdust schools have been consoli- 
dated. The board proposed to the people of these communities 
to build a house if the people would raise one thousand dollars, 
the amount necessary to secure a four-acre lot. This sum was 
raised, and the board has just completed a three-room frame 
building, at a cost of about $1,800.00. The consolidated school, 
called Woodrow, now has an enrollment of 100 pupils. 
The city of Mt. Pleasant issued $10,000.00 worth of bonds 
and erected an addition to her school property. The County 
Board of Education sold the Howard Institute for $9,600.00, 
realizing a profit of $5,000.00, and secured an eight-acre lot 
adjoining the city school lot, and is now erecting a two-story 
brick building at a cost of about $8,000.00. The City School 
Board, the County School Board, and the County High School 
Board have reached a working agreement whereby all these 
school interests have been consolidated. The consolidated 
school has an attendance of about 350 pupils. 
TEACHING FORCE. 
There has been a marked improvement in the teaching force 
of the county. The annual salaries of the teachers has been 
increased and this enables the board to employ a better corps of 
teachers than formerly. This year the board employed only 
nine teachers that had had no experience in teaching as against 
thirty, two and three years ago. Of these nine, all except two, 
had had the equivalent of a high school course, and in addition, 
four of the nine had had two years of college work. We have in 
all 100 white teachers in the county schools. - 
ScHooL IMPROVEMENT Work. 
We have a School Improvement Association, composed of the 
teachers of the county. This association holds a meeting each 
month in connection with the regular monthly meeting of the 
teachers. The experiences of the teachers who have done some- 
thing during the month are always an interesting and helpful 
feature of the school improvement program.   
 
-P-A-G-E-543

Onie of the greatest needs of the county now is a new high 
school building for the Columbia High School, which has an 
attendance of more than 200 pupils. 
Joun P. GRAHAM, 
County Superintendent. 
MEIGS COUNTY. - 
The present outlook in Meigs County for better ‘schools is 
not very ‘encouraging to school workers. In looking back over 
the last two years, it can not be said that much has been accom- 
plished in the way of advancing the school’ interests of the 
county. 
Meigs County did have three combined grammar high schools 
that were accommodating more than 20 per cent of the whole 
enrollment of the county. These schools had begun to create 
a school interest and were proving to be incentives to those 
pupils of the public schools that were in the upper grades. But 
the County Court, at its January meeting of 1911, abolished all 
three of these schools, and all efforts since to have one, or more, 
high schools established have been fruitless. The failure of the 
leading school workers to secure high school facilities, and the 
continued unfriendliness of the County Court towards schools 
have had a tendency to discourage many educational leaders 
in the work, and to greatly retard the progress of the schools. 
Nevertheless, efforts have been made, and are still being 
made, to keep’a school spirit alive and growing. At the begin- 
ning of the year 1911, a Boys’ Corn Club of 15 members was or- 
ganized. Fifty dollars in gold, calves, farming implements and 
merchandise were offered as premiums by some of the business 
men of the county and the County Superintendent, and the 
superintendent offered $10 in gold for best compositions on the 
growing of corn. This contest seemed to arouse some interest 
in part of the schools, and some very good results were secured 
by the corn club boys. This year another club with about the 
same number of members has been organized, but the results 
have not been reported yet.
-P-A-G-E-544

The teachers’ annual institutes, prior to this year, have con- 
tinued for five days with examinations during part of the time. 
Very little real work could be done during this short session. - 
This summer the teachers’ institute of Meigs County continued 
for four weeks. Several good instructors assisted in the work, 
and a number of good lectures were given during the session. 
It is believed that the teaching force of the county was greatly 
benefited by attending this institute. 
The County Board of Education not only assisted in paying 
part of the expenses of the institute, but increased the salaries 
of all those teachers that attended the full term 
During the school term of 1911 we held a series of teachers’ 
meetings, or school rallies, at different points throughout the 
county. Teachers, pupils and patrons of all nearby schools 
would gather at some selected school and render a program of 
songs, recitations, and addresses with occasionally a debate. 
‘These meetings were well attended, and seemed to arouse a good 
interest in the school work in the community where held. An- 
other series of meetings have been arranged for this school term, 
to be held at different points from those of last year. 
‘To sum up: Our school funds are small. Our County Court 
is not liberal with us. Our school term is short, and we are handi- 
capped in many ways, but by hard work we are getting our . 
schools better graded, and are issuing more eighth year certifi: 
cates than formerly. During the last two years we have built . 
a few new schoolhouses, and have repaired others. We are 
working to better our conditions at the present, and hoping for 
something better for our little county in the future. 
Lutuer F. RICE, 
County Superintendent. 
MONROE COUNTY. 
I herewith submit my twelfth annual report for the year 
ending June 30, 1912. 
The county institute of two weeks was held the first of June, 
and was attended by about 100 teachers, many of whom took an 
active part in the real institute work.
-P-A-G-E-545
— 520 — 
Profs. H. L. Callahan and C. B. Brown are live wires in in- 
stitutes. -Miss Ella Johnston did excellent work in grammar. 
The Monroe County High School, at Madisonville, has been 
changed to the Central High School, and a new high school 
established at Sweetwater. . 
During September, D. R. Haworth was with me one week 
in fifteen rallies. As a result of this weeks’ work, eight school- 
houses were painted inside and much improvements made on 
the outside. Prof. Haworth is certainly an excellent educational 
campaigner. 
Last spring a small farm of thirty acres was acquired for z a 
Demonstration Farm in connection with the Central High 
School. Preparation is being made to utilize a large building 
on this farm for a boys’ dormitory. By next spring we expect 
to do some demonstration work on this farm. 
It is the intention of the present authorities to so arrange 
the tilling of this farm that poor boys can get sufficient work to 
. make their board, then there will be no excuse for any one failing 
to get a high school and agricultural education. 
With the belief that we are making some progress, I am, 
S. J. Parks, 
County Superin: ‘endent. 
MONTGOMERY COUNTY. 
In the last two years we have been able o consolidate only 
two schools inte one, and have built a house for the use of the 
consolidated school. As I said before, this has been my plan for 
the advancement of the school interest in my county, but it 
has been bitterly fought at every step. We have built two other 
two-room houses. These three houses were built at the cost of 
more than $1,000.00 each, and are very fair structures. But 
the crying need of our county is better school buildings and good 
roads, that the children may be able to attend school in the win- 
ter months. . 
We have ten or twelve growing libraries in the county and 
the teachers and pupils are adding to the supply of books by 
giving entertainments of various kinds. Our Corn Club has
-P-A-G-E-546
— 521 — 
more than a hundred enthusiastic working members. The 
Girls’ Tomato Club has also passed the one hundred mark. 
In my visits to the schools this fall I have tried to get the 
teachers and pupils to organize ‘‘mothers’ clubs,” and to get the 
parents interested in other ways, as I regard the support of the 
parents the greatest factor in the management of any school. 
We have a School Improvement Association, consisting of some 
of the best teachers and mothers of the county. 
We have had a great awakening of interest in the country 
schools this fall, as indicated in the increase of attendance. It 
remains to be seen whether this enthusiasm will carry them 
through the bad weather and bad roads during the winter 
months. 
E. BUCKNER, 
County Superintendent, 
MOORE COUNTY. 
A paper containing suggestions for the improvement of the 
public schools was read to the County Court at its January 
and April terms. Among other things, consolidation of schools 
was recommended longer terms of schools desired; better prep- 
aration of teachers by some plan in Moore County, and remedy- 
ing some insanitary conditions of the scheol buildings, in addi- 
tion to need of money for repairs outside of the the school und. 
We used ‘Picture Study,’ and other literature from C M. 
Parker, at our teachers’ institute and continue it in our monthly 
meetings. 
We emphasized agriculture in the institute, and demanded 
that it be taught int accordance with the graded course of study. 
We are planning to organize a Boys’ Corn Club by next year. 
Moore is to be represented in the Boys’ Encampment at the 
State Fair this year. 
We are to have our first school exhibit this year at our county 
stock fair. The premiums given are complimentary by School 
Improvement Association and County Superintendent. 
A kodak is to be purchased by the Association to get views 
of theJexterior and interior of school buildings and grounds for 
display.
-P-A-G-E-547
— 522 — 
A copy of a book, ‘The Call of the New South,” was put into 
the Teachers’ Library, among other books by the Association. 
An agricultural paper, “The Progressive Farmer,” is to be 
used in teaching agriculture in the schools, and to give more ~ 
life to its study. 
Cora WISEMAN, 
County Superintendent. 
MORGAN COUNTY. 
T am enclosing herewith my annual statistical report, which 
reveals, in a way, some salient facts as to the inner workings of 
our school system in this county. The work of the schools was 
much more satisfactory last year than in former years, for dif- 
ferent reasons. A strong effort was made to systematize much 
that had been done in a superficial or haphazard way. One 
feature that was thus systematized and rendered vastly more 
interesting and helpful was the organization of reading circles 
in different parts of the county, to study and discuss the reading 
circle books. The work of these meetings was varied and some 
general institute work injected. These meetings were well at~ 
tended—-one meeting having 45 teachers in attendance—and 
much genuine interest manifested. The same plan will be fol- 
lowed again this year, with perhaps a general ‘‘rally” day added. 
Our county, by virtue of its geographical and industrial 
diversity, presents two very contrasted conditions. The eastern 
part of the county is essentially a coal mining section, with quite 
a numerous population. Hence, the schools are more in number, 
nearer together, and more crowded with pupils, than the western. 
half which is situated on the Cumberland Plateau, with its sparse 
population, its scattéred schoolhouses, and small schools. For 
example, where the writer sits he can hear distinctly three school 
bells and the shouts of the children at play at each place; while 
in the western part of the county, the problem is to locate the 
school so as not to cut off some children entirely on account of 
distance. 
We have been endeavoring for four years to supplant the 
old antiquated log structure and slab seat with a neat, comfortable 
frame building, with modern furniture, etc., and, as a result the
-P-A-G-E-548
— 523 — 
schools are in partnership with only two or three churches, and 
only one pioneer log cabin to house a school remains in the county. 
At our present rate of building, every community in Morgan 
County will have a modern, well-furnished school building 
within the next two years. Our county seat, over forty years 
old, has had no school building until the present year, but now 
boasts of a $5,000 high school building on a 5-acre campus. 
Two years ago our school debt was $20,000; now it is a little 
over $9,000. ; : 
Parents’ Day was quite generally observed throughout the - 
- county in the schools. Many patrons visited the schools on 
that day, arid were thus stimulated to ‘‘come again,” establishing 
a more cordial relationship and a stronger spirit of co-operation 
between parent and teacher. 
Our Normal was conducted along different lines this year, 
and was easily the best, most interesting, profitable and best 
attended in the history of the county. Instead of the long- 
winded theorist, with his hobbies and methods, he became a 
practical teacher and showed the modus operandi in actual class- 
work, 
The subject of agriculture and home economics was greatly 
stressed in several able lectures‘ by prominent educators So 
much enthusiasm resulted that the teachers present, more than 
a hundred strong, passed resolutions asking the High School 
Board to take steps to have in actual operation at our next Nor- 
mal, an agricultural experiment farm on the campus, showing 
the principles of scientific agriculture applied to the cultivation 
of the leading crops of our section, which will be done. Commis- 
sioner Peck was with us for one day. 
What our county needs most, is a set of school officers with 
the “‘nerve’’ to go to work and stem the tide of popular prejudice, 
and consolidate at several points, bringing together some of the 
weak, one-teacher schools, and having instead, several strong, 
prosperous three-teacher schools 
This year we shall make another step toward systematizing 
our work by furnishing teachers at the close of the term with a 
set of questions or the promotion o: pupils completing the work 
of the 8th school year. J. C. Wesster, 
County Superintendent.

OBION COUNTY. 
The Obion County schools are composed of fifty-seven pri- 
mary and thirty-three secondary schools, besides two city 
schools. Several of these primary schools have two teachers, 
but many of the secondary ones try to do with one. This is a 
serious mistake, as no teacher can do the work well in such a 
‘school. It is gratifying to note that several of our schools have 
three teachers now, some four and some five. Several schools 
‘this session have been compelled to add another teacher to the 
. number heretofore used. : 
Our schools need better sanitation. The County Board of 
Health and the County Superintendent are inaugurating a cam- 
paign for better conditions of the school closets, school grounds, 
and a general toning-up of the health of the schools. 
* Obion County has a population of 29,956; of these 10,412 
are of school age. JI am sorry to say that only 83 per cent of these 
was enrolled last year and only 50 ‘per cent of the enrollment 
was in daily attendance. Many large boys stay away to work, 
thinking that the small amount of money at present is of more 
account than the greater blessings of culture and education to be 
had as a result of good schooling. 
Obion County has a school term that averages seven months, 
but as we do not have the county board system in this county 
this does not mean that each school in the county had'a term of 
seven months. It ought to be so, but it is not. There is some 
increase in the school interest along the lines of school improve- 
ment, but room for much more. Our libraries are growing under 
the new law giving us State aid. We now have 40 libraries, 
containing 2,700 valumes, with money subscribed for a few 
more. 
This county is fortunate in having a good school tax. The 
State gives $10,000 in round numbers, the county gives $60,000. 
Some schools supplement the amount due them by private sub- 
scription. Woodland this year gave $250 in this way. 
Mason Hall is erecting a new building at a cost of $6,000. 
Obion has improved her building to the extent of $6,000. Union 
City has added a $10,000 Carnegie Library to her school campus 
this year. These are some of the improvements in school build-
-P-A-G-E-550
— 525 — 
ings, but I am sorry to say that the school buildings have not 
kept pace with the magnificent country residences that the sub- 
stantial farmers of Obion County are putting up over the county. 
We hope to. have better buildings for the school children. The 
idea that the schoolhouse should be the most attractive place 
in the community is growing. 
C. L. Riw1nes, 
County Superintendent. 
OVERTON COUNTY. 
More than ordinary interest has been shown in Overton 
County schools for the last year, due to many causes. 
First, our teachers have, almost fo a body, attended the 
Livingston Academy school, and by so doing prepared for better 
service. 
Second, a general stimulus has been brought about by each 
teacher trying to raise himself in the estimation of County 
Education Board by surpassing other teachers in the manage- 
ment of his school. 
Third, the compulsory school law has done more for the 
schools of Overton County than all other agencies combined. 
More than 85 per cent of the scholastic population have attended 
the schools for school year beginning July 1, 1912. I fail to see 
how any educational question could be more popular than this 
law—even groups of citizens rising up and asking ‘‘Why have we 
not had this law before?’’ Overton County favors State-wide 
compulsory law. 
Fourth, Overton County people are getting interested in 
school libraries. 
More people lave visited our schools this year than for past 
three years. This fact itself is very significant of progress.

County Superintendent.

take advantage of every opportunity extended. 
Most of our houses are poor, but we have been doing every-

made. 
Most of our teachers are young, but are of excellent character,

R. H. Gray, 
County Superintendent. 
POLK COUNTY. 
Progress in the schools of Polk County has been gradual, but 
the people are demanding better school houses with better 
equipments and more efficient teachers. : 
Our people believe teaching is a profession and that no person 
should be licensed to teach who has not professional training 
along the line of teaching. 
More than one-third of our teachers attended summer schools, 
normal schools, or college during the past year and a large per 
cent of these teachers have been teaching several years. This 
alone indicates an awakening along educational lines. ~ 
Four buildings have been erected the past year, three two- 
room buildings, at a cost of $900.00 each, one brick building with 
five rooms, $6,700.00. About $3,000.00 has been spent for re- 
pairs, patent desks, and other furnishings, during the last two 
years. Two high school buildings, at a cost of $19,000.00 each, 
are being constructed and will-be ready for use September, 1912. 
‘The expense of the buildings will be met by bond issue and tax 
levy.

We shall expect two special laws to be enacted by our next

out the State and means by which this.law can be enforced, the 
second one-third of the gross revenues of the State for schools. 
W. B. Rucker, 
County Superintendent. 
PUTNAM COUNTY. 
When I came into the office of County Superintendent two 
years ago, what I considered to be the greatest weaknesses in our 
schools were the following: We were then under the old Director 
System, too many .of our teachers were incompetent because of 
too great a leniency in examinations; we had too many small 
schools, and there was no system or scale for rewarding teachers for 
faithfulness in their work and for superior qualifications. ‘These 
things. were particularly applicable to this county, while we had 
the weaknesses of many other counties in the State, especially 
that of lack of money. 
The Legislature of 1911 placed this county under the county 
board system, and we were fortunate in getting men of superior 
‘ intelligence as members of the Board of Education, and the 
evils of the old system are entirely eliminated. 
Teachers were forced to stand on their own merits in examina- 
tions and the result is that many of them are now spending their 
vacations attending school, and we are now getting together a 
body of earnest and well qualified teachers. 
Consolidation of schools is a slow process, but we have con- 
solidated two schools into one large one this year, and we plan 
two other consolidations next year. : 
We now have a system of paying teachers according to quali- 
fications—forty dollars, forty-two dollars, and forty-five dollars 
per month for teachers in primary schools, according to the grade 
of certificate held, and sixty dollars per month for principals of 
consolidated and secondary schools. 
We hold monthly meetings at the county site for the purpose 
of studying the reading circle books, as well as rallies at different 
places in the country where they are demanded.

The State institute held at Cookeville in June, 1912, was a 
great factor for the uplifting and inspiring of the teachers in this 
section, and I believe much good has and will result from it. 
In addition to the work of superintending the scheols of the 
county, we have organized a Boys’ Corn Club of 30 members, 
and the acres of corn cultivated by the boys in some localities 
has attracted much attention among the older farmers. 
We plan to continue along the same line of work in the future 
that we have in the past. We are not satisfied with the results, 
but are glad to see at least some improvement. The attendance 
this year is better than last and last year was some improvement 
on the year before. The only thing we have not succeeded in 
improving, at least some, is the school.fund. Our terms are 
too short, and we are very much in favor of the increase in the 
percentage of gross revenue to be applied to the school fund as 
proposed, and believe that the increase should go to the elemen- 
tary schools. 
J. M. Hatrietp, 
County Superintendent. 
RHEA COUNTY. 
In response to your request for information unstatistical 
and supplementary, allow me to say that we have done much 
in the way of libraries, books donated and money raised. We 
have organized corn clubs and. tomato clubs, but have only 
gone through the initiative steps and hope to do much next 
year. 
We have done something in the way of consolidation, but not 
as much as we hope to do in the near future. - We have intro- 
duced one school wagon and find this works well as a help to 
consolidation. This wagon has been used to transport high 
school pupils. I think this county will soon effect much con- 
solidation by this or some other means of transportation. 
We found it necessary to enlarge the first high school building 
in Dayton. This is now being done. This school has an en- 
rollment of 160 pupils. We have also a consolidated high school 
at Spring City. . :  
-P-A-G-E-554

In the last two years 8 new school buildings have been erected 
~—7 at an average cost of $700.00 and one in Graysville costing 
$10,500.00. Our terms are being cut short as a result of the 
expenditure of school money in school buildings. - 
The practice of erecting schoolhouses from school money is 
working badly in Rhea County, the school fund being a common 
fund. 
The Rhea County School Board has been hoping to secure a 
bond issue with which to erect school buildings and take all the 
school money of each year for running expenses of schools. 
The board has not succeeded in this respect as yet. 
For benefit of the. counties where a bond issue can not be 
secured there should be some legislation to prevent shortening 
school terms by using school money for building purposes. 
W. E. STEPHENS, 
County Superintendent. 
ROANE COUNTY 
In reply to your request to furnish a general statement in 
regard to the condition of schools in Roane County, will say: 
That during two years we have furnished patent desks for 
17 schools, have built 4 new buildings and repaired 6 others. 
We have brought our enrollment up to 85 per cent. We have 
reduced our illiteracy about 11 per cent. We have organized 
school improvement clubs in a very large number of our schools. 
These have wrought wonders in the improved appearance of 
grounds and the sanitary conditions of premises. 
We have discontinued three schools. 
We have established one consolidated school, which is proving 
the wisdom of the measure by the excellent work that it is doing. 
We have introduced the individual drinking cup into all of 
our schools. Since doing so we have had to close none of our 
schools on account of sickness. 
Our NEEDS. 
We need a longer school term and a teaching force that. has — 
a more practical education. We are stressing these points and. 
are making some improvement.
-P-A-G-E-555
— 580 — 
We need more consolidation and better means of securin, 
regular attendance. While our enrollment last year reached 
85 per cent, our average attendance was only 62.2. . 
We are making an effort to make the school a center of com- 
munity interest. 
We will have a good boys’ corn club at work next year, and 
perhaps a girls’ tomato club. 
We have our county and district school rallies and are inter- 
esting many patrons of the school in that way. 
E. B. Boots, 
County Superintendent. 
ROBERTSON COUNTY. 
Replying to your request of recent date for a supplementary 
report of the educational conditions of Robertson County, 
covering a period of two years and touching upon attendance, 
libraries, corn clubs, school improvement work, teaching force, 
consolidation, supervision, etc., I submit the following brief 
report: 
PixE Bonps. 
The one important question that has practically overshad- 
owed all others during the past two years was that of bond issues 
for the construction of a system of public highways. After a 
fight, the county has voted bonds to the amount of $450,000.00, 
which will, under contract and now in course of construction, give 
us 160 miles of splendid pike. Believing in the necessity and 
importance of this movement, I have not undertaken any radi- 
cal movement in the interest of the schools. This system of 
public highways is one very important factor in securing better 
attendance and, as I could see from the beginning, is paving the 
way to consolidation of many of our schools, perhaps many in 
the near future; therefore, I feel that this material improvement 
is one of the best that could have been agitated in the interest 
of the public school. ,
-P-A-G-E-556
—~ 531 — 
ATTENDANCE. 
The attendance in our public schools is gratifying as com- 
pared with former years. October and November are our best 
months for attendance. This year our September enrollment 
exceeded either of these months of last year, and October and 
November of .this year will go far beyond the record for last 
year of the same months. While this is the best record we have 
ever made in point of attendance, I regret to say that there are, 
approximately, between 500 and 800 boys and girls in this county 
who are not in school and will not be enrolled at all. Iam doing 
now, and have been doing, some special work to increase the 
enrollment, and I think that I can attribute, in a small degree, 
the increase in this year’s attendance to this special work. 
LIBRARIES. 
Since the enactment of the law providing for State aid in 
the establishment of rural libraries, we have established about 
52 libraries. There is a good sentiment for this movement here. 
A number of schools are planning to raise funds for this purpose, 
and some are now ready to make application for State aid. 
Corn CLuss, 
I secured an enrollment of 38 boys from different sections of 
the county who agreed to plant and cultivate one acre of corn as 
outlined by the Department of Agriculture, but owing to the 
fact that the late rains delayed the planting some of the boys 
became discouraged and the result was that we withdrew the 
competitive feature of the work. And, too, we were unable to 
get any aid from the district manager, consequently we had to 
rely upon the Department at Washington for the only literature 
to be used. Notwithstanding these facts and conditions, some 
of the boys made a good showing. 
TEACHING Force. 
I believe that I can truly say that our teaching force is stronger 
than any we have ever employed. I say this because we have 
been able to retain all of the best of last year’s force, and those
-P-A-G-E-557
— 532 — 
that we have employed from other counties are here because the 
inducement is better here than at home. Our monthly salary, 
on an average, is nearly $50.00, which is better than is paid by 
most counties, hence we feel that we have these teachers here 
because the inducement is better and not because they could 
do no better. Our per cent of young, inexperienced teachers for 
the past three or four years has been from 23 to 33 per cent of 
the entire teaching force, while this year we have only 8 begin- 
ners. We have more professionally trained teachers than ever 
before. 
CONSOLIDATION. 
We have been able to consolidate three schools, i. e., put 
three in one. This is working well. Consolidation is not, and 
will not, be practical in Robertson County unless transportation 
is provided. : 
Iam much gratified with a plan I have put on foot to consoli- 
date about three or four schools into one, which is now a school 
of some two hundred pupils. The plan is to have the town of 
Adams furnish the building, which it has agreed to do, and owing 
to the location and: the fact that a system of pikes afford easy 
facilities, the people are taking hold of the plan with some degree 
of interest. The town has issued $6,000.00 worth of bonds and 
with a supplement of some $4,000 worth of school property now 
in use, they will be able to erect a building adequate for the pro- 
posed consolidation. I have two other centers in view for the 
consolidation idea; however, this is the most favorable at this 
time. Consolidation is the solution to our problems here. 
Our little one-room schools are doing about as much as can be 
expected of them. 
ScHOOL IMPROVEMENT. 
Our school property is in fairly good condition. During the 
past two years the Board of Education, with the assistance of 
the local communities, has erected four modern one and two-room 
school buildings. These buildings have been located with a 
view to consolidation. Houses have been painted, new furni- 
ture installed, re-roofed and improved in many ways.
-P-A-G-E-558
— 533 — 
ScHOOL SUPERVISION. 
I must admit that I have been able to do little supervising. 
With the number of schools, 112, the clerical work, the detail 
and directing the policies of the board have kept me too busy to 
do very much along the line of supervision. It is true we have 
a uniform course of study, uniformity in classification and pro- 
motion of pupils, issue uniform examination for the regular pro- 
motion of pupils, etc., but I am not supervising in the strictest 
sense. This can not be done by one man alone under the pres- 
ent condition. 
In conclusion, we stand for progress, for the consolidation 
idea, with transportation of pupils, for a reasonable compulsory 
attendance law, and are working for longer terms, better build- 
ings, a more competent teaching force and a closer supervision 
for all the schools. 
O. H. BERNARD, 
County Superintendent. 
SCOTT COUNTY. 
The public schools of Scott County have no doubt made as 
marked progress during the past two years as has been made in 
any other county in the State. , 
The average salary for teachers has been increased from $40 
to $48 per month. The enrollment and average attendance of 
pupils has increased considerably. A number of new school 
buildings, some of them splendid two and three-room structures, 
have been erected. Nearly all of our country schools have been 
graded and supplied with patent desks. The personnel and qual- 
ification of the teaching force of the county is better than ever 
before, and working in perfect harmony for the success of the 
schools. : 
Some progress has been made in the consolidation of schools 
notwithstanding the strong opposition of the people affected. 
More of this work is needed and will be pushed as fast as.local 
conditions will admit.
-P-A-G-E-559
— 534 — 
Our compulsory school law is still unpopular with the people, 
but opposition to it grows less each year. Its enforcement has 
worked well, and we expect to have very little trouble this year. 
A School Improvement Association has been organized, and 
we expect through this medium to increase the interest in edu- 
cation throughout the county.

SEQUATCHIE COUNTY. 
In answer to your recent inquiry concerning our. schools, I 
will say that nothing of special importance has been done in 
the last two years. Our school term is 41% months. We need 
longer terms, better equipment, better roads.and some schools 
consolidated. Our attendance has improved slightly as a result 
of grading the schools. 
The average salary of teacher is $40 per month. Our teaching 
force is as good perhaps as we can get for the salary. . 
The county pays superintendent $115 per year, and he cannot 
be expected to do much work. There are no libraries in the 
county except a small one at Dunlap. 
We have no corn clubs or tomato clubs. / 
What we need most is more money with which to work. 
Our county is small and poor, so we are laboring under dis- 
advantage. 
W. V. FREILEY, 
County Superintendent. 
SEVIER COUNTY. 
I will say that the special work I have done in this office in’ 
the past tavo years has been along the line of consolidation, 
which we have worked out with difficulty, but have had fairly
-P-A-G-E-561
— 536 — 
good success in this work. To my surprise, we found some op- 
position to the movement and this caused us some delay in the 
work, which for the most part has been successful.. We suc- 
ceeded in getting what was twelve one-teacher schools into five 
schools. This is all we have done in the way of consolidation. 
We have paid special attention to attendance this year and 
have succéeded in keeping it up much better than formerly, and 
the plan we are using is working splendidly. But we hope to 
have a compulsory law after the next Legislature meets. While 
we have not been able to hold the large boys in school.during the 
work season, we have made special effort to keep the girls and 
small children and have succeeded much better than in previous 
years. . 
We have a regular organized Corn Club, but have not done the 
work in this respect that we hope to in the future. Last year 
was such a dry season that several of the boys made a failure and 
it is a little hard to get them interested again. 
We are beginning a new work in the way of school improve- 
ment work which will get special attention during the next term 
of my office if I remain in this work. I have not undertaken 
every progressive project this term, but have given nearly all of 
my attention to the few which I feel have been more or less of a 
success. 
J. R. KeEBxez, 
County Superintendent. 
SMITH COUNTY. 
In compliance with your request, I hereby submit a report 
of the school situation of Smith County for the years 1911-1912. 
‘It gives me great pleasure to report continued advancement 
in the standard of teachers and schools of Smith County. Thirty 
. per cent of our teachers hold degrees from universities, colleges 
and high schools. Quite a number of our teachers are attending 
the State Normal at Murfreesboro. All are striving for higher 
’ qualifications. Nearly every schoolhouse in the county has been 
put in a neater and more attractive condition. We have raised 
_by popular subscription since January, 1911, $14,500 for new
-P-A-G-E-562
— 587 — 
school buildings and repairing of old buildings. - Two years ago 
we had only one school with more than two teachers. We now 
have four schools with three and four teachers and two more will 
open in January, 1913, with three teachers. The superior work 
of these schools will prove a starting point for more consolidation. 
We have nine permanent libraries for the county, with a bright 
prospect for several new ones. We have had about ten circulat- 
ing libraries in the county in the last two years; we now have 
seven and the people are showing much interest in the library 
movement. Our compulsory school law, while it shows an in- 
crease in the average daily attendance of about 800, compared 
with 1910, has not met our expectations. The law requires.a 
prosecutor, and no one seems anxious to prosecute his neighbor. 
We have a Corn Club of twenty-five members. This practical 
idea in education appeals to the people in the rural districts 
and-we are striving to make our schools meet the need of the 
every-day life of our people. 
J. C. NIcHoLs, 
County Superintendent. 
STEWART COUNTY. 
In compliance with the requirements of law, I herewith submit 
to you the annual report of the public schools of Stewart County 
for the year ending June 30, 1912. In making this report, I will, 
in accordance with your suggestion, call your attention to some 
-of the conditions of the schools of this county. 
Looking at the educational situation now and only a few years 
ago I feel warranted in saying that we are making much improve- 
ment in our work. The educational interest in the county is 
getting better. There seems to have been more interest upon 
the part of the people during last term than at any time in my 
recollection. Owing to the lack of funds, the public school term 
for the year was only five months. However, in many places in 
the county the people contributed from their private means and 
tun the schools eight and nine months. About two thousand 
dollars was contributed for this purpose.
-P-A-G-E-563
— 538 — 
A good deal is being done towards improving the school prop- 
erty. Some of the best school buildings in the county have been 
erected in the last two years. As fast as circumstances will 
permit we are furnishing the buildings with good school furniture. 
However, we are not‘able to do this as rapidly as we wish. One 
of the most pressing problems we have to solve at present is 
furnishing room and equipment for those demanding admittance 
to our public schools. 
W. C. Howe tr, 
County Superintendent. 
SULLIVAN COUNTY. 
As to what Sullivan is doing educationally, I am pleased to 
say that all our force and agencies are quietly but earnestly 
working for better teachers—better schools and better equip- 
ment. Many of our teachers attended the State Normal 
School at Johnson City during the summer, and it is hoped their 
work during the coming year will show marked improvement. 
As usual, our annual institute was well attended, and the 
work done was most satisfactory to all. Prof. S. W. Sherrill 
proved himself in the front rank as an institute instructor. 
Prof. I. L. Jones and Miss Sara Doggett were also very potent 
factors in making the institute a success. 
The outlook for another prosperous school year is very en- 
couraging. 
J. E. L. SENEKER,' 
County Superintendent. 
SUMNER COUNTY. 
Permit me to say a word in regard to the schools of Sumner 
County. - 
As you know, I am serving my first term as County ‘Superin- 
tendent. My predecessor, the Hon. W. F. Albright, was one 
of the most progressive and efficient superintendents of the 
State, hence when I came into the office, I found the educational 
spirit and the general school interest of Sumner County very 
» much alive.
-P-A-G-E-564
— 539 — 
We have sixteen secondary schools that are doing the equiva- 
lent of about three years’ work in a good county high school, 
and elementary schools convenient to almost every child in n the 
county. 
We are putting in new furniture, talc boards, repairing houses, 
wells and grounds as fast as we can, with due regard to the length 
of school term, which is too short in this county. But we are 
glad to say that the county board, by good business principles, 
have the largest balance to their credit this July that they have 
had for some time, and we will be able to lengthen our term from 
5 months to 6% or 7 months. 
We had a mass meeting at Gallatin in July ‘of preachers, 
‘teachers, doctors, lawyers, farmers and business men from every 
district in the county for the purpose of organizing to solve the 
illiteracy question of Sumner County. 
Supt. J. W..Brister made a strong and forceful address, 
followed by a number of citizens. As a result, every teacher 
present seemed to catch the fire and fathers and mothers are 
being interested, and we are going to wipe out illiteracy in old 
Sumner. 
We are organizing classes in the Sunday-schools throughout 
the county, the teachers are having night schools, and Friday 
afternoon classes, and when we cannot get them into the Sunday- 
school or night schools, we are going into their homes. 
We are teaching men and women seventy-five years old to 
read and write. 
Our teachers make a report on this work at every ‘monthly 
teachers’ meeting. If the lack of a calico dress or books is keep- 
ing a child from-school, we supply them and let the child enter. 
Men and women are interested in this work who have never been 
interested in public education before. 
T. W. Hunter, 
County Superintendent. 
TIPTON COUNTY. 
The school situation in this county shows a decided improve- 
ment. The enrollment for the past year is fifteen per cent better
-P-A-G-E-565
— 540 — 
than for the preceding year, and the schools now have.a record- 
breaking attendance throughout the county. 
The average salary now paid the principals of. our white 
rural schools is $59.75 per month, an increase of twelve dollars 
per month over the preceding year. 
The average length of term for the white schools the past 
year was 144 days. This year it will be from 165 to 170 days. 
Of the 90 white teachers employed in our rural schools, vir- 
tually all are members of our County Teachers’ Association, and 
that body is doing fine work. 
’ Of the principals of our rural schools, but one has less than 
the equivalent of a high school education, and a large percentage 
of them are graduates of some institution of collegiate rank. 
Our schools are operated under a county board of seven, the 
same having been created by an act of the last General Assembly. 
Though in effect but little more than a year, this law has revo- 
lutionized the school work of the county, and now has the ap- 
proval of most of those who at first opposed it. 
We have inaugurated uniform examinations for all the schools 
of the county, the questions being prepared by the County Su- 
perintendent, and have required the teachers in the advanced 
. grammar grades to give monthly written tests to the pupils. 
The teachers are also required to submit monthly reports to the 
parents, showing the class standing, deportment, etc., of the 
pupils, these reports being furnished the teachers at the expense 
of the county. 
The Boys’ Corn Club has about two hundred members, and 
considerable interest has been manifested in the work. Last 
year Norman Smith, a Tipton County boy, made the largest 
yield for West Tennessce and the second largest in the State, his 
acre producing 166 bushels, and was awarded one of the Govern- 
ment trips to Washington. This year about $300.00 in cash 
prizes has been offered, and a large exhibit is expected the last 
of this month. 
Both the county high schools are doing good work. The en- 
rollment at the Byars-Hall School, which is located at the county 
seat, last year was 195, and that will be exceeded this year. At 
its head is Supt. B. O. Duggan, who is doing a great work, not 
only for the school of which he has charge, but for the educa- 
. tional interests of the county.
-P-A-G-E-566
— 541 — 
We keep a ledger account with each school in the county, 
showing the expenditures, etc., and for what made. I find this 
very helpful in making comparisons of the cost per pupil in the 
different schools, and that it makes members of the Board of 
Education and the County Court take more interest in school 
finances, as they thus get a better idea of the cost of maintaining 
the schools than they do from a general report showing how much 
is spent for the entire county, each being interested, as a rule, in 
some particular school. . 
The most marked improvement in our school work in the 
past two years has been in the personnel of the teaching force, 
and the increased interest the teachers are manifesting in educa- 
tional work. About one-fifth of our rural teaching force is 
young men, and all of these are doing enthusiastic and effective 
work. Our Board of Education is composed of practical school 
men, and merit is the only test of promotion and employment.

Built five houses and painted five old buildings; put new 
desks into three others; re-covered two. Bought Hartsville 
Masonic Institute for a public school. Put water céolers into 
two schools and drinking cups‘into two others. 
The average attendance was very gratifying, from 80 to 85 
per cent being shown by teachers’ registers, etc. 
I personally visited every school in 1912 (before I came to 
Monterey) and some of the schools in 1911 were visited three or 
four times whenever necessity demanded it. : 
Have a Boys’ Corn Club. of thirty-five active members, who 
raised the average yield, per acre, from nine to seventeen barrels. 
Secured liberal appropriation from County Court for agri- 
cultural show at Hartsville in November. Also, through Capt.

Kater Leer NICHOLS, 
County Superintendent. 
UNICOI COUNTY. 
I herewith transmit my annual report for the year ending 
June 30, 1912. In addition to this report, I beg to make a few 
statements in regard to the progress made the past year, and the 
prospects for educational advancement in the future. 
The educational progress made in Unicoi County during the 
last two years, while not perfectly satisfactory, is very gratifying. 
We have improved many of the school buildings, raised the stand- 
ard of efficiency of the teachers, and have five months’ graded 
school term. : 
Our teachers’ meetings are always well attended, not only by 
the teachers, but the masses generally, which shows an awakened 
interest among all classes of the people. 
Our greatest need is more money, that we may pay our teach- 
ers better salaries, and thus hold our more efficient and experi- 
enced teachers and not be forced to engage so many young and 
inexperienced ones each year. Another great need is better 
schoolhouses, modernly equipped, and more neat and attrac- 
tive grouiids.. . 
It is our intention to build three houses, costing $500, $650 
and $1,400, respectively. Contracts are already out for the 
completion of all these houses by the middle of September, so 
we can avail ourselves of their use the present year. 
All teachers who are to teach in my county this year have 
pledged themselves to open night schools for free instruction of 
the adult illiterates. By this means, we hope to teach all to 
read and write. I feel sure, too, that such schools will greatly 
increase the educational interest all over the county. 
May God bless the teachers in this unusual but most laudable 
undertaking. RW. H. Gnert 
, County Superintendent.

UNION COUNTY. 
" The greatest drawback to the schools of Union County is 
the lack of funds. With a scholastic population of and 
only $122.17 school fund, we can not hope to accomplish much. 
Yet, with this meager sum, we had a term of five months, paying 
the teachers an average salary of $37.44 per month. This was 
due to the fact that the county board was very economical in 
the expenditure of money for expenses. The standard of teach- 
ers is being raised. We now have a corps of good teachers who 
are energetic in their work. 
No building of any note has been done. 
We have not consolidated any schools, but the question of 
consolidation has been very prominent before the people. 
There are a few places where I think consolidation ought to be 
made. I have every evidence that it will be done this year. 
We are going to have some rallies, which I hope will result in 
good, and mould the public sentiment more firmly in favor of 
consolidation.

WARREN COUNTY. 
I herewith send my annual report for the schools of Warren - 
County. 
We have just finished one year’s work under the county 
board system. 
In the main the schools have been well managed and well 
taught. Our people are more interested in the public school than 
any other time in the history of our county. Therefore a strong 
sentiment favoring free education is quite general. There has 
been a practical, diligent devotion to the cause that has given 
us splendid results. No effort has been made to excite or give 
undue stimulation to the work, but a reasonable degree of en- 
thusiasm and energy has prevailed and the usual advances have 
been made in every department of work.

A uniform course of study for the county high schools has 
been worked out and adopted, the work is being put on a better 
basis, and the standard of efficiency is being raised. 
No county institute was held this year, it having been ar- 
ranged for all teachers to attend the summer session of the East 
Tennessee Normal School at Johnson City. One hundred and 
eighteen teachers were enrolled from the county. 
The tax levy for schools has been raised seven cents on the 
hundred. The school term was increased last year to seven 
months—the longest in the history of the county. 
Regulations for the systematic certification of teachers is © 
being worked out, and attention is being directed toward the! 
betterment of the elementary school.

County Superintendent. 
WEAKLEY COUNTY. 
I submit the following as a supplement to my annual report 
sent you some time past. . 
We have censolidated five schools since July 1, 1912. We 
have consolidated Mt. Arie and Holt, Hickory Grove and Sharon, 
transportation not being required in any of these schools. 
Thomas School is transported to Central Academy at a cost of 
thirty-five dollars per month, and Flippo School to Gardner 
Station at a cost of forty-four dollars per month. We are now 
running two school wagons very successfully in this county at a 
saving of several dollars to the tax payers. There are thirty- 
four pupils on the first route. Of this number, thirty were en- 
rolled the first month with an average daily attendance of 
twenty-seven. Thomas School ran six weeks this term, with an 
average daily attendance of twelve. The,wagon has not carried 
less than twenty-three any day. Thomas School was costing us 
fifty dollars per month when we were making an average at- 
tendance of twelve, now it is costing only thirty-five dollars per 
month, with an average daily attendance of twenty-three. We 
have another application for transportation to begin in a week
-P-A-G-E-573

or two, however, I do not know whether the county board will 
put it on this term or not. The people are perfectly delighted 
with the transportation idea, and it is being talked of with much 
interest all over the county. 
Many who very bitterly opposed consolidation, with trans- 
portation, are now in favor of it. In fact, it is as one of the 
county board members said, ‘‘The question of the small school 
is solved.” 
We are not trying to do anything with the county high school 
proposition just at this time, but we believe by making our rural 
-schools better that the county high school will come of its own 
‘accord. Our enrollment and daily attendance for the present 
term has been unusually large. Many of our schools have en- 
rolled every pupil in going distance, or who is entitled to attend 
public schools. We are doing our very best to enroll all who are 
of school age in the county. While we will not be able to get 
all in school, we hope to make the best record along this line that 
has ever been made in the county. The percentage of illiteracy 
among our white adults is so small that we think it not wise to 
follow up your suggestions by having schools to teach them to 
read and write. Less than one per cent of our white adults can 
be classed as illiterates. 
We believe our schools are making more permanent progress 
along every line of progress than ever before, but we still have 
plenty of work to do, and as I see it, we are just now beginning 
on the greatest educational reform in the history of our State. 
SyL FISHER, 
County Superintendent. 
WILLIAMSON COUNTY. 
While our schools are making genuine progress, we would 
be glad to see it more rapid. : 
Our attendance grows larger each year, yet too many children 
of school age are kept out of school. 
We have a library in nearly every school, and our teachers 
supplement these libraries from time to time. We use all the
-P-A-G-E-574
— 547 — 
travelling libraries we can secure from Miss Skeffington and Mrs. 
Kelley. Besides, I have converted my office library into a free 
circulating library for the schools of my county. It consists of 
a thousand volumes suited to the various grades. I hope to 
get this enlarged into an adequate county library. 
We have an interesting corn club, but no tomato club. 
We have consolidated very few schools during the last two 
years. 
Our teaching force has improved greatly, due largely to our 
high school system. 
We have a school term of nine months. Our school improve- 
ment work is very gratifying. The buildings have been repaired 
and improved, and the grounds receive much attention. 
FRED J. Pace, 
County Superintendent. 
WILSON COUNTY. 
Wilson County schools have made a gradual improvement 
during the scholastic year 1911-12. 
Our greatest needs are better attendance and consolidation 
of schools. We have succeeded in making three schools out of 
six during the year, and the satisfaction from the same is splen- 
did. Through better grading and a system of missionary work 
on the part of the teachers, the attendance is better. 
The school improvement work has not progressed in Wilson 
County as it should. The work has been confined to certain 
localities, has not been general, but several organizations are 
at work which will tend to make the showing better for another 
year. 
Wilson County is getting educated to the need of a high school. 
At least two schools will employ transportation during the 
scholastic year 1912-13.

PUBLIC SCHOOL LIBRARIES 
The table given herewith shows the progress of the public 
school library movement during the last two years. It will be 
noted that some 323 libraries have been established in 69 different 
counties. Previous to this year some 500 libraries had been es- 
tablished under the stimulus of the State aid provided in the 
Acts of 1909, so that there are now between 800 and 900 public 
school libraries in the public schools which have been established 
partly by State aid and partly by local subscription within the 
last three years. This, of course, does not include all the public. 
school libraries in the State, since there are many schools which 
had them prior to 1909 and many others which have been es- 
tablished without taking advantage of the assistance furnished 
by the State. 
Following the table is a circular issued by the Department 
of Public Instruction showing the location of libraries estab- 
lished as well as certain information concerning the movement. 
A brief but interesting report, prepared by the State Libra- 
rian, of the library extension work carried on jointly by the De- 
Partment of Public Instruction and State Library is also given.

STATE OF TENNESSEE 
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. 
NASHVILLE, June 1, 1912. 
To County Superintendents and Teachers: 
We have just tabulated the records'of this department with 
reference to the establishment of public school libraries, and for 
your information we give below the report showing the number 
of libraries established in each of the counties of the State:

  It is very gratifying to note that many-of the counties have 
made splendid progress in the work of establishing libraries for 
their schools, but it is certainly to be regretted that there are a
-P-A-G-E-598
— 571 — 
number of counties that have not received one cent of the money 
provided by the Legislature for this purpose. The children of 
one county are as much entitled to their share of the library 
fund as the children of another, and it is the duty of the County 
Superintendent and teachers to see that they get their share of 
all the benefits provided by the State. 
As will be seen by referring to the above table, some counties 
have established as many as fifty libraries. These counties, 
with the aid of the State, have spent more than fifteen hundred 
dollars for school library books. This does not mean that one 
county has taken advantage of another, but it does show that 
some school officials have aroused more interest in the library 
work and have secured for their children the benefits which 
have been provided alike for all the children of the State. 
The blessings resulting from the use of books cannot be esti- 
mated. The public school library not only delights, instructs 
and educates the child from the first grade through the entire 
school course, but we believe, if properly used, it will help to 
stimulate and keep alive the child’s interest in school work at 
that period in his development when studies become most irk- 
some and the desire to leave school is strongest. 
I appeal to you as the guardians of the children’s interests 
to see to it that a movement is started that will secure to the 
children of your county opportunities equal to those which are 
enjoyed by the children of any other county in the State. 
Very truly yours, 
J. W. BRIsTER, 
State Superintendent. 
TRAVELING LIRRARIES. 
The same Act which provides for the establishment of per- 
manent school libraries also provides that libraries may be cir- 
culated in the counties under the direction of this department 
and the State Library. The State Librarian reports that 96 of 
these traveling libraries for rural schools are now in circulation 
in sixteen counties of the State. It is hoped that the people of 
every county can be interested in the libraries provided by the 
State; to raise sufficient funds to secure State help in establish-
-P-A-G-E-599
— 572 — 
ing libraries in every school; and then to supplement the public 
school library by one of the traveling libraries furnished abso- 
lutely free by the State. Information in regard to the circulat- 
ing libraries can be secured by addressing Miss Mary Skeffing- 
ton, State Librarian, Nashville, Tenn. 
How State Arp May BE SECURED. 
The General Education Bill of 1909 set aside 25 per cent of 
the gross revenues of the State for school purposes. One per 
cent of the fund derived from this appropriation is used to en- 
courage and assist in the establishment and maintenance of li- 
braries for the public schools, as provided below: 
“Whenever the patrons and friends of any public school in 
any county of the State shall raise by private subscription or 
otherwise, and tender to the County Trustee, through the 
County Superintendent of Public Instruction, the sum of $20 
or more for the establishment and maintenance of a library for 
that school, said County Superintendent shall notify the State 
Superintendent of Public Instruction, and upon the certificate 
of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, the Comp- 
troller of the Treasury shall pay to the Trustee of said county, 
out of the fund herein provided, a sum equal to half that raised. 
by private subscription or otherwise, to be added to the library 
fund of said school; -and whenever $10 or more shall be raised 
by private subscription or otherwise to supplement a library 
already established under the provisions of- this section of this 
Act, said library may in like manner receive from the fund here- 
in provided a sum equal to half the sum so raised. 
“Provided, That no school shall receive in any one year 
from this fund more than $20 for the establishment of a new 
library, or more than $10 to assist in supplementing a library 
already established. 
How to Secure Loca Funps. 
There are various ways of raising the necessary local funds. 
We give here some suggestions, but any teacher who is awake to 
the need and has a sufficiently strong desire for a library, will 
find some way to secure it.
-P-A-G-E-600
— 573 — 
1. Interest your pupils in a library and have them make a 
canvass of their homes and among their friends for subscrip- 
tions. ‘ 
2. Give a school entertainment, or a series of entertainments, 
and charge a small admission fee, having it distinctly under- 
stood that the purpose is to secure funds for a library. 
3. Have the pupils agree to contribute a certain amount 
during each week for a stated period. 
4. Have a series of spelling matches with other schools, 
charging a small admission fee. 
5. Give a tea or supper to the mothers and ask their co- 
operation. . 
Celebrate a national holiday or commemorate the birthday 
of some great man and take a voluntary collection or subscrip- 
tion at the close. : 
7. Interest some public spirited citizen to make a proposi- 
tion to give as much money towards the library as the school 
will raise otherwise.

REPORT OF STATE LIBRARY EXTENSION WORK, 
BEING DONE IN COUNTY SCHOOLS 
Section 6 of the General Educational Bill of 1909 provides 
first for the establishment of permanent school libraries, and 
provides further that one-fifth of the amount accruing annually 
for school libraries, under the provisions of this Act, may be 
used for the purchase and maintenance of circulating or traveling 
libraries for the public schools of the State, under the joint di- 
rection of the State Library and the Department of Public In- 
struction. 
Under the provisions of Section 6 of this Act, the Tennessee 
State Library sent out in August of 1910, the first traveling li- 
braries ever sent out and operated by the State. A two-fold 
object is in view in operating traveling libraries in the. public 
schools. : 
First—Attention is given to the school children, recogniz- 
ing in them the future citizens of the State, and endeavoring 
to make of them, the children of to-day, the reading men and 
women of tomorrow. By circulating libraries through the 
schools where the teacher becomes the librarian and is held re- 
sponsible by the County Superintendent, these books do in fact 
circulate through the schools, and the advantage of good books 
is given from the primary grades through high school. The 
libraries are made up of picture books and books of simple little 
rhymes and jingles, then little nature studies, easy reading, etc., 
for the primary grades. Then nature, geography, description, 
travel, history, biography and general literature, from the pri- 
mary grades through the high school. In the majority of cases, 
when a child is carried from the primary through the high school 
in constant association with books, and where the teacher insists 
on these books being read, the reading habit is formed, and the 
boys and girls of to-day have become the reading men and 
women of tomorrow, for reading comes by habit. 
Second—The adult member of the family is reached through 
the child. The teacher gives the books to the child to take 
home; they take them home and they are eagerly read by the-
-P-A-G-E-602
— 575 — 
adult members of the family, as well as by the children them- 
selves. All the reports tell the same story: ‘‘The books are 
eagerly read, both by old and young.” 
‘To-day, the State Library has six libraries of fifty volumes © 
each in the following counties: Anderson, Fayette, Henry, 
Carter, Bénton, Davidson, Hickman, Knox, Lincoln, Madison, 
Williamson, Montgomery, Rutherford, Robertson, Wilson, Car- 
roll, James, Franklin, Coffee, White, Putnam, Maury, Hum- 
phreys, Bedford, Lawrence, Dyer, Hardeman, Rhea, Giles, 
. Lewis, Claiborne, Obion, Smith, Hamilton, Sullivan, Sumner, 
Fentress and Blount. Two hundred and twenty-eight libra- 
ries, the equivalent of eleven thousand four hundred books. 
The purpose of the traveling school library is not to super- 
sede, but to supplement the permanent library, and ‘to go into 
the schools and communities where there are no permanent 
libraries, and arouse the desire for books that will lead to the 
establishment of permanent libraries. In this work of circu- 
lating traveling’ school libraries, the State Library has received 
the active co-operation of the Department of Public Instruc- 
tion. .

TEACHERS’ READING CIRCLE 
Comrrree, 1911-1912. 
B. O. Duggan, Covington. 
Fred B. Frazier, Dayton. 
Fred J. Page, Franklin. 
State Superintendent, Ex-Officio. 
The State Reading Circle Committee met in the office of the 
State Superintendent September 2, 1911. In view of the fact 
that there are comparatively few secondary teachers in the State 
and the expressed purpose of the Department of Education to 
prescribe a course of reading for the teachers of the County High 
Schools, it was decided to select only two books for the teachers 
of the elementary schools. 
It is believed that the books selected will appeal to the teach- 
ers of our so-called secondary schools as well as the primary 
teachers. It is also believed that it will be an advantage to 
have all the county teachers organized into one reading circle 
class. It will save time, it will generate enthusiasm. The 
union of all the teachers in the discussion and study of the 
books can but result in greatly stimulating interest in the 
monthly teachers’ meeting and the annual institutes. 
The following texts were selected: 
Chamberlain’s Standards in Education, published by the 
American Book Company, Cincinnati; Kemp’s History for 
Graded and District Schools, published by Ginn & Company, 
Atlanta, Ga. . 
The price of each of the books is 90.cents, postpaid; in lots © 
of ten or more, 80 cents, express or postage prepaid. 
County Superintendents and teachers understand that all 
public school teachers will be required to pass examination on 
the above books before receiving a license to teach in the public 
schools of the State. These subjects will appear on the face of 
the certificate. This requirement is made in accordance with - 
the provisions of the school law, as set forth in Section 7, Sub- 
section 9, Chapter 25, of the Acts of 1873.
-P-A-G-E-609
— 580 — 
The County Superintendent should give one forty-minute 
period to each subject .at.each County,, Institute. The best 
talent the county can command should be called into service 
to instruct these classes, and instead of selecting a different 
teacher for each monthly mecting, the instructor should be se- 
lected for the year. The study of these subjects will be con- 
tinued in the State and County Institutes: .No“teadHer! can 
master them in a few days; hence all are urgéd' to debwte the 
books at once, join the classes and enter heartily:into the work. 
Superintendents are requested to give immediaté notices 6f the 
books selected: to their teachers. _ wim oth

STATE TEACHERS’ READING CIRCLE COURSE FOR ELEMENTARY AND HIGH SCHOOLS, 1912-1913. 
Commrrrer,.

P.. L. Harned, State High School Inspector, ‘Geeretdey 
Fred B. Frazier, Elementary School Inspector. 
M. W: Wilson, Superintendent Knox County Schools: 
» Ju D. Jacobs, Superintendent Ruthérford County Schools:’ 
      : According. to the requirements. of the School Law,, Section 
7, ‘Sub- section 9, Chapter 25, Acts of 1873, a professional course 
of study:i is prescribed for the public school teachers of, the State. 
The purposes of this course are (1) to direct study along definite 
lines in, harmony with the work of the State Department, (2) 
to offer a. definite subject from which questions for the pro- 
fessional part of teachers’ examinations can, be made, and (3) to 
cultivate the ‘habit of professional study in a systematic way 
among. all teachers. It is not the purpose of the Department 
to limit the work to the books selected each year, but to make 
them the minimum for a year’s professional study. The stu- 
dent-teacher will do much more, making his own selection of 
supplementary books which treat the special work in which he 
is interested. 
Two | courses of reading are prescribed by the. State Depart- 
ment: One for teachers of the elementary schools, which will 
include also teachers of the so-called secondary schools, and the 
other for teachers of the County High Schools; ‘and two books 
are selected’ for each course. 
In cartyitig on the work County Superintendents a ae @ urged 
to adhere to the following plan: 
“In counties that have only elementary schools, the’ superin- 
tenderit will appoint, or the teachers may elect, £WO! thoroughly 
competent instructors to teach the books selected for. elementary 
teachers; designate the place, the day, and the ‘hours of the day 
in each month, beginning with September ‘ ‘and endingwith May, 
for thé ‘meeting to discuss thoroughly thé parts '6£ tHe books
-P-A-G-E-611
— 582 — 
assigned for that day, the period of each recitation not to be less 
than forty minutes. 
At the first annual examination held in the various counties 
in June uniform questions for professional credit will be fur- 
nished by the State Department to county superintendents and 
they will be authorized to renew the certificates of the elemen- 
tary teachers who successfully pass this examination. County 
superintendents are requested also to make their questions for 
professional credit, for all new applicants for elementary cer- 
tificates, from these books. 
In counties having high schools two competent high school 
principals or teachers holding high school certificates should be 
appointed or elected to teach.the books selected for the high 
school course, At the end of the year questions will be sent by 
the State Department on the work done during the year and all 
high school teachers who hold certificates (not special)“issued on 
examination or college diplomas may have their certificates re- 
newed by taking this examination. All applicants who take 
either State or County high school examinations. will be given 
questions for their professional grade selected from the adopted 
books for the year in which the examination is given. 
During the year, beginning September, 1912, the following 
books will be used: 
I. Elementary Teachers’ Reading Course: 
1. Hough and Sedgwick’s Hygiene and Sanitation, Ginn & 
Company, Atlanta, will be furnished in single copies,

more than two books for each class of schools, but in its investi- 
gation was pleased with Gilman and Williams “Seat Work,” 
published by the Macmillan Company, ‘and offered in single 
copies, postpaid, $0.45; or in lots, carriage extra, $0.40. Teach-

Report of Committee on President’s Address. 
‘We, your Committee on the Address of President Anderson, 
beg leave to report as follows: 
In the recommendation that thirty-three and one-third per 
cent of the gross revenues of the State be devoted to educational 
purposes, we heartily concur and pledge our best efforts as 
officers and members of the State Officers’ Association to urge 
upon members of our Legislature that they support such a bill 
at the next meeting of the General Assembly. 
That we concur in his recommendation for the extension of 
the Compulsory School Law to the entire State, and that we 
urge upon City Councils and County Courts to provide neces- 
sary funds and officers for the proper carrying out of said law. 
That we heartily approve of his recommendations of changes 
in our courses of study to adapt them to the needs of the com- 
munities, to the end that the peculiar natural talents of boys 
and girls may be ministered to. We agree that the rural school 
furnishes the chief problem in education to-day, and believe 
that proper revision of the course of study, with extension of 
work into the departments of Domestic and Mechanical Arts, 
with Agricultural Courses for rural schools, will result in keep- 
ing a larger number of pupils in the schools until better results 
can be achieved. 
We believe his recommendation for a uniform standard of 
teachers’ requirements is now a necessity and should be enacted 
into a law at the next meeting of the Legislature. 
In his recommendation for the abolition of Advisory Boards 
of Education on the ground of their uselessness, we mainly 
agree, but believe that there should be kept one member from 
each district who should have the general charge of repairs to
-P-A-G-E-632
— 603 — 
buildings, and who is to be held responsible for proper care of 
buildings and grounds during the vacation period. 
The President’s recommendation as to revision of the law 
for census enumeration is passed over with no recommendation. 
We believe with the President that a revision of the law so 
as to require the ‘County Trustee to make’such prompt and ac- 
curate reports in such form as to enable the County Superin- 
tendent to make full and accurate reports to the State Super- 
intendent. 
In general we commend the report of our retiring President 
for its wise suggestions and careful consideration of leading 
problems in State education, and we believe if they are heeded 
and made a part of the policy of the State Officers’ Association 
they will prove advance steps in the history of our State.

To County Superintendents: 
The State Commissioner of Agriculture is preparing to issue 
bulletins for each county in the State, setting forth its resources 
and other facts of general interest. He has asked the Depart- 
ment of Education to furnish educational data for these bulle- 
+ tins. . 
We believe this is an admirable opportunity for each county 
to advertise its educational advantages along with its other re- 
sources; and if it appears that the educational condition is not 
such as to make the county attractive to the homeseeker and 
invester, it will call attention to the lack in such a striking way 
as to command consideration and remedy. County Superin- 
tendents will please co-operate with us in making the educa- 
tional chapter of the bulletins most valuable and interesting. 
I suggest that you prepare a paper on the educational situa- 
tion'in your county, using between fifteen hundred and eighteen 
hundred words, writing the article as if for the press, and not 
confining yourself to mere answers to the suggested questions. 
The following outline may be suggestive: 
I. Schools of the county. 
1. Elementary (Primary and Secondary.) 
(a) Number. .

3. Attendance. 
(a) Percentage of enrollment in daily attendance. 
(b) Causes of non-attendance. 
(c) Compulsory attendance and whether desirable. 
4. Length of school term and reasons for or against a long 
term. ° 
5. Community interested in schools. 
(a) Whether people generally. are favorable to the schools. 
(b) Interested in public school improvement.

It is not expected that you shall follow it closely: but in your 
way describe the educational situation in the county and set 
forth your educational advantages. We are counting on you to 
do this in order that your county may be properly represented 
in the forthcoming bulletins.

With the hope of securing an early and comprehensive state-

J. W. BristEr, 
State Superintendent. 
. NASHVILLE, September 6, 1911. 
To County Superintendents: 
I desire to direct your attention, at the beginning of the new 
school term, to a matter which I regard as of very great import- 
ance to your schools and communities. , 
As you know, the General Education Bill provides that a 
certain per cent of the amount derived from this source shall 
be used for the establishment of public school libraries. Under 
the provisions of this Act more than six hundred public school 
libraries have. been established at a cost of something like 
twenty-thousand dollars, the State contributing one-third of this , 
amount. 
We now haye on hand to the credit of this library fund about 
$15,000. Your county is entitled to its share of this fund. Many 
counties have taken advantage of this offer on the part of the 
State; for example, White County has established 23 libraries, 
Coffee County 27, Anderson 31, Robertson 33, Sevier 22, and 
others have done almost as well, which shows what County 
Superintendents and teachers can do in arousing library interest 
and creating the reading habit among the people. I appeal to 
you to bring this matter to the attention of all your teachers 
_and suggest to them ways and means for raising funds locally 
in order that they may receive aid from the State. The State 
gives one-half as much as a community raises to establish or to 
supplement a library. It is our hope that this entire fund will 
be exhausted during this school year. 
If we can be of service to you in corresponding with your 
teachers direct from this Department, please give us the names 
of such teachers and we will gladly write them. We solicit 
your earnest effort and promise you our hearty co-operation. 
Sincerely yours, 
J. W. BristEr, 
‘State Superintendent.

NASHVILLE, September 26, 1911. 
Dear Sir: . ., . 
We are endeavoring to interest every teacher in the State 
in the establishment and improvement of public school libra- 
ries. We believe it is possible to start a library in every public 
school in the State this year and we want you to be among the 
first to take advantage of the State's offer to assist. 
The enclosed circular will explain to you the provisions 
under which State aid may be secured, and also gives some 
practical suggestions about raising the necessary local funds. 
Will you not enter upon a library campaign immediately? 
Here is one way you can materially contribute to the value of 
your school and enrichment of the life of your community. 
Let us know as soon as possible what are the prospects for 
starting a library in your school, and do not hesitate to call 
upon us for any information or other help we can give. : 
Yours very truly, 
J. W. BristEr, 
i ‘ State Superintendent. 
INFORMATION RELATIVE TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PUBLIC 
ScHooL LIBRARIES, 
The General Education Bill of 1909 set aside 25 per cent 
of the gross revenues of the State for school purposes. One 
per cent of the fund derived from this appropriation is used to 
encourage and assist in the establishment and maintenance of 
libraries for the public schools, as provided below: . 
“Whenever the patrons and friends of any public school in 
any county of the State shall raise by private subscription or 
otherwise, and tender to the County Trustee, through ‘the 
County Superintendent of Public Instruction, the sum of $20 
or more for ‘the establishment and maintenance of a library for ° 
that school, said County Superintendent shall notify the State 
Superintendent of Public Instruction, and, upon the certificate 
of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, the Comp- 
troller of the Treasury shall pay to the Trustee of said county, 
out of the fund herein. provided, a sum equal to half that raised 
by private subscription or otherwise, to be added to the library
-P-A-G-E-649
— 618 — 
fund of said school; and whenever $10 or more shall be raised 
-by private subscription or otherwise to supplement a library 
already established under the provisions of this séction of this 
Act, said library may in like manner receive from the fund 
herein provided a sum equal to half the sum so raised. 
“Provided, That no school shall receive in any one year 
from this fund more than $20 for the establishment of a new 
library, or more than $10 to assist in supplementing a library 
already established.” 
Since the passage of this Act more than six hundred schools 
have availed themselves of the opportunity to secure libraries. 
The Department has not been able to use all the funds available 
for this purpose on account of lack of interest on the part of 
many teachers. We are not only ready, but anxious, to turn 
this money back into the various counties of the State. We 
have on hand an amount sufficient to meet all demands, and 
school teachers all over the State are urged to inaugurate some 
movement in their localities to secure a part of this fund. 
Nothing will so enrich the life of a school as the possession 
of a few well selected books for the boys and girls. ‘It is hoped 
that every teacher in the State will take advantage of this op- 
portunity, and before the end of the present school year estab- 
lish a library in his school. 
How To Secure Locat Funps. 
There are various ways of raising the necessary local funds. 
We give here some suggestions, but any teacher who is awake 
to the need’and has a sufficiently strong desire for a library, 
will find some way to secure it. 
1. Interest your pupils in a library and have them make a 
canvass of their homes and among their friends for subscrip- 
tions. 
2. Give a school entertainment, or a’series of entertainments, 
aand charge a small admission fee, having it distinctly under- 
stood that the purpose is to secure funds for a library. 
3. Have the pupils agree to contribute a certain amount 
during each week for a stated period.
-P-A-G-E-650
— 619 — 
4. Have a series of spelling matches with other schools, 
charging a small admission fee. / 
5. Give a tea or supper to the mothers and ask their co- 
operation. 
6. Celebrate a national holiday or commemorate the birth- 
day of some great man and take a voluntary collection or sub- 
scription at the close. 
7. Interest some public-spirited citizen to make a proposi- 
tion to give as much money towards the library as the school 
will raise otherwise. 
8. Get a supply of School Improvement Buttons from Miss 
Moore, State Organizer, S. I. A., Nashville, sell them to friends 
and patrons of the school, and retain half of the: proceeds for 
your library and other school improvements. 
Any other information desired can be had by writing to the 
State Superintendent of Public Instruction, Nashville, Tenn. 
NASHVILLE, November 4, 1911. 
To County Superintendents: 
I want to take this means of calling your attention to the 
need of consolidation in properly developing our school system 
in Tennessee. I am well aware that what I have to say is an 
old story, but it can do no harm for me to emphasize it at this 
time. 
It is a fact worthy of note that the States that are making 
the most progress in educational matters, and the counties of 
our own State which are in the forefront educationally have 
considered the matter of consolidation seriously and have en- 
tered upon it in a thoroughly systematic way. 
It is reasonably certain that we can make no great improve- 
ment in school conditions as long as we endeavor to maintain 
so many single-teacher, one-room schools. No ‘teacher can do 
satisfactory work with forty or fifty pupils ranging through six 
or eight grades. Until we adopt the consolidation as a fixed 
policy and begin to combine the single schools as rapidly as 
circumstances permit we need not expect decided and perma- 
nent improvement.
-P-A-G-E-651
— 620 — 
The two prime desiderata of a school are (1) as Jarge a num- 
ber as possible of the available children in attendance, and (2) 
efficient instruction.. Both results are realized by consolidation. 
It is a fact almost universally attested to that when two or 
three or four single teacher schools are consolidated the attend- 
ance upon the one new school is in excess of the combined at- 
tendance upon all the single schools. And there can be no sort 
of doubt as to the improvement in instruction. Three or four 
teachers working in one school with all their pupils together 
will bring about a school spirit which is wholesome and uplift- 
ing. Such a school community will realize its power and will 
soon begin to contribute not only to the life of the children but 
will reach the adults as well, helping them and securing: their 
help. 
Consolidation means a more satisfactory calassification and 
grading of pupils, more of the teacher’s time to each child and 
class, and in consequence more rap d and real advancement. 
There is a widespread feeling that the curricula of our ele- 
mentary schools ought to be vitalized; that agriculture and 
domestic science ought to be introduced; that the content even 
-of the conventional studies need revision; all for the purpose of 
enriching the school course and relating it more directly to life. 
It is absolutely certain that this cannot be done with the 
single teacher schoo]. Already his program is crowded and 
there can be no addition to the burdens he is carrying. Only 
in the consolidated school can we hope to introduce such re- 
forms. . . 
As I have indicated above, consolidation is the condition of 
progress—of more efficient teaching of modernized curricula, of 
increased attendance, of permanent educational success. 
Consolidation, in most‘ cases, involves transportation, but 
we need not be afraid of that. Some of the counties of Tennes- 
see have school wagons transporting their boys and girls back 
and forth daily, and they are just as essential and vital a part 
of the school as the teacher or the building. Local conditions 
vary greatly and no one could prescribe intelligently for every 
county in the State; but it is agreed that under ordinary con- 
ditions in rural communities one school for every twenty or 
twenty-five square miles is sufficient. If the school is situated
-P-A-G-E-652
— 621 — 
in the center of such an area no pupil would be at any very 
great distance, especially if means of conveyance are provided. 
I hope every County Superintendent will give consideration 
to this important matter; will study his local situation thor- 
oughly and plan such consolidations as are practicable. When 
once you have decided upon what ought to be and can be done, 
it would be weil to enter upon a systematic campaign. It will 
take time to persuade the patrons of the various schools that 
change of location is desirable; but it is only by persistent 
effort, argument and appeal that a sufficient endorsement can 
be secured to guarantee success. 
If I or any of my co-workers can help we shall be glad to do 
so. The Presidents of the Normal Schools also with their facul- 
ties are ready to aid. To any ambitious County Superintend- 
ent with a real plan of school reform we can promise hearty 
co-operation. 
In closing I should like to ask every County Superintend- 
ent to keep me informed as to the work of consolidation and 
other school reforms projected in his county. Please let me 
know to what extent the work has gone on during the last few 
years and what are the prospects for other consolidations in the 
immediate future. 
Very truly yours, 
J. W. Brister, 
State Superintendent. 
NasHviLte, November 11, 1911. 
To Members of County Boards of Education: 
I want to take this means of directing your attention to our 
State Normal Schools and to the opportunity which will be 
presented to the wide-awake Boards of Education in the coun- 
ties of the State of ‘securing a better grade of teachers than 
many now available. 
The Normal Schools, of course, cannot supply all the teach- 
ers needed; but they will turn out year after year scores of well 
trained men and women who temporarily at least must teach. 
in the schools of Tennessee, and who can be retained. for long
-P-A-G-E-653
— 622 — 
periods if we can offer compensation equal to that which is 
given in other States. 
You can help the Normal Schools in their work by urging 
your teachers to attend its sessions as far as possible, and by 
giving notice that, in filling new positions, preference will be 
accorded to students and graduates of the Normal Schools. 
I need not take time to argue the need of trained teachers 
for our schools. Every man who has given school matters suf- 
ficient thought to warrant his being a member of a Board of 
Education realizes that the teacher is the most important factor 
in any school. And further, that men and women who have 
had professional preparation, special training for the work, are 
much more apt to give efficient instruction and render valuable 
service than those who have not had such advantages. 
May I ask you then to favor applicants for school positions 
who have been in attendance on our normal schools? May I ask 
you to go further and seek teachers who have had normal train- 
ing by getting into correspondence with the normal school presi- 
dents and asking their aid in filling positions?, And will you not 
use your influence in your county to have offered such salaries 
and inducements to teachers as will attract the best trained 
men and women and hold them in the profession? 
You can be most helpful to us in developing our normal 
schools by adopting such a policy, and you will at the same time 
render a most valuable and acceptable service to your county. 
Very truly yours, 
J. W. BRIsTER, 
State Superintendent. 
NASHVILLE, TeNN., November 17, 1911. 
Dear Sir: The Middle Tennessee Farmers’ Convention will 
be held at State Capitol, in Nashville, Décember 5, 6, and 7, 
1911. 
The special train which has recently been run by the Southern 
‘Railway in East Tennessee, under the auspices of the State 
Agricultural Department, with the co-operation of the State 
Department of Education and Health, has taught us again the
-P-A-G-E-654
— 623 — 
value of co-operation, and convinced us of the identity of our 
interests. We have, indeed, one aim and are working for the 
same end; we are all endeavoring to make some contribution 
to rural life. 
I am sure, therefore, the sessions of the Farmers’ Convention 
will be of value to every county superintendent, and I urge you 
to attend. It will give us an opportunity not only to participate 
in a gathering in which we have a lively interest, but we can 
also take advaritage of the occasion to confer in regard to the 
special matters which engage our attention. 
Free transportation can be furnished every county superin- 
tendent. Please notify me at once whether you can be present, 
and the railroad ticket will be sent. 
Very truly yours, 
J. W. BRISTER, 
State Superintendent. 
NASHVILLE, TENN., December 12, 1911. 
To County Superintendents: 
Please give me the following information as soon as possible, 
taking into account only the white schools of your county, not 
including town and city schools: 
1. How many schools in your county with only one teacher? 
How many with two teachers? 
How many with three teachers? 
How many with four teachers? oe wh 
. How many with more than four? : . 
6. How many consolidations have been made the last two 
years? 
7. How many single-teacher schools have been abandoned as 
a result? 
8. Are you now planning any consolidations? 
9. How many schools are to be abandoned if your plans are 
carried out?
-P-A-G-E-655
— 624 — 
10. Do you think that consolidation on any considerable scale 
is possible in your county? 
-11. If not, why not? 
12. In your opinion, if consolidation is adopted as a policy, 
how many single-teacher schools can be advantageously aban- 
doned? : 
13. If consolidation is adopted as a policy, how many schools 
will be necessary to furnish educational facilities for your county? 
- 14.’ What is the total number of schools now? 
Note—I am making a study of consolidation and need this 
information. I also desire your opinion before drawing any con- 
clusions. Of course, consolidation, to be thoroughly successful, 
involves transportation. Please carefully consider questions 10, 
11, 12 and 13, and let me have the benefit of your views. 
I shall be obliged if you will respond to this communication 
at the earliest possible moment, giving answers on this sheet. 
Very truly yours, 
J. W. BRISTER, 
State Superintendent. 
NASHVILLE, TENN., January 8, 1912. 
To County Superintendents of Middle Tennessee: 
The colored teachers of Nashville and adjoining counties have 
recently organized a Colored Teachers’ Association, and a meeting 
of the association has been called for April 4, 5 and 6, in Nash- 
ville. . 
I believe this meeting, if largely attended, will be of benefit 
to the teachers and also to the schools they represent. I advise, 
therefore, that you take the matter up with your boards of educa- 
tion and get them to allow their colored teachers to attend the 
meeting, granting them holiday with pay for April 4:5, a policy 
which I understand you have pursued with reference to the white 
teachers who attend the Middle Tennessee Teachers’ Associa- 
tion. ,
-P-A-G-E-656
—- 625 — 
I would be glad also if you would furnish me as soon as pos- 
sible a list of the colored teachers of your county. 
Very truly yours, 
J. W. BrisTER, 
State Superintendent. 
NASHVILLE, TENN., January 20, 1912. 
To County Superintendenis: 
There are some things of a general nature concerning your 
work that I have wanted to say for some time, not in a dictatorial 
way, but merely as suggestive. 
I am profoundly convinced that the supreme need of our 
rural school system in Tennessee to-day is wise administration 
and competent supervision. Progress waits on this. We need 
not expect any far-reaching and permanent improvements in 
the schools in any county without it. But, given in any county 
a live, wide-awake, intelligent, consecrated superintendent, who 
devotes all his time and thought and energy to school work, and 
success is assured. He will work out a comprehensive scheme 
for the development of his school system, and sooner or later, will 
arouse general interest in educational matters and will be able 
to secure necessary funds for carrying on the plans he has de- 
vised. : 
Tennessee needs all her superintendents to be of this type. 
And she expects them to be. In a peculiar sense they have 
become State officials. Part of their salary now is paid by the 
State, and in the case of a large number of them the law requires 
that all of their'time for nine months of the year shall be devoted 
to school work. 
It is earnestly hoped that every county will soon increase 
the salary of the superintendent to an amount sufficient for him 
to receive the maximum from the State, for no county can afford 
to have less than the entire time of a well- equipped man to super- 
intend its schools. : 
I am sure that a county superintendent cannot render his 
county efficient service, cannot do for the schools what he ought 
to do, when he is devoting a considerable part of his time and
-P-A-G-E-657
— 626 — 
thought to some other pursuit. This is not to be taken as re- 
flecting on any particular individual. It is only to insist that 
the matter of supervising the schools of any county or adminis- 
tering its educational affairs is a big enough job for the brightest 
and brainiest man in the county, and any man whose interests 
are divided will fall short of doing his best for his schools. 
I wish I could impress upon every county superintendent his 
importance, how he is standing for progress or in its way, how 
his country’s schools depend largely, primarily on him, and their 
condition: shows, beyond question, the kind of.superintendent 
he is. He can’t shirk the responsibility, he can’t shift it. It is 
his. And if he can’t make good, if school interests are lagging, 
his self respect ought to make him give place to some man better 
adapted to the great and important work. 
Let me urge every one of you to renewed study of the educa- 
tional situation in your county. Outline a comprehensive scheme 
of school development, inaugurate a general forward movement, 
devise, if possible, some specific, immediately workable plans, 
and then go at the work as if the future of your county ‘depends, 
as it does, on your efforts. 
Let me say again, what I have said to all of you in a general 
way, and to many particularly, that this office is ready to serve 
you in any possible way. Whenever we can help we shall be 
only too glad to do so. We have one aim, one purpose, one 
desire, and that is to build up, improve, develop the public schools 
of Tennessee. 
Cordially yours, 
J. W. BrisTEr, 
State Superintendent. 
NASHVILLE, TENN., January 31, 1912. 
To County Superintendents: 
Please let me call your attention to the Boys’ Corn Club 
movement and to urge every one of you to thoroughly investigate, 
and, if possible, have a part in it during the current year. Anum- 
ber of county superintendents organized clubs last year with 
signal success; others have joined them since, and the movement 
is well under way in the State.
-P-A-G-E-658
—— 627 — 
But every county superintendent ought to become interested 
and take steps at once, if practicable, to perfect an organization 
in his county. Of course, it is too late to secure the best results 
this year, but a beginning has to be made, and those who start 
now will be prepared to get into the front rank next year. 
There are several reasons why I feel impelled to urge county 
superintendents to undertake the work: 
First, on account of the movement itself. It is unquestion- 
ably true that we need some new farming methods inour country, 
and especially in the South. It is also. true that the corn clubs 
have already demonstrated the possibility of inculcating some 
elementary principles of agriculture in such a simple manner as 
to be intelligible to and usable by boys of high and upper grammar 
school grades. The movement was well-timed, and has been in- 
telligently directed. Its continued success depends upon its 
relation to the public school system. If it can be closely associat- 
ed with the school work, if it can be made a vital and integral 
part thereof, it will have been joined with the one institution in 
the country that will add to its strength and give it permanency 
of life. 
Arfother reason for urging this upon county superintendents 
is because of what it means to the schools. One of the soundest 
criticisms of the school grows out of its artificiality, its aloofness 
from real life, its apparent lack of interest in life. A lively par- 
ticipation in the corn club and kindred movements by our school 
people will effectually dispose of this criticism, and will show that 
the schools are functioning for the industrial and economic. 
life of the people as well as their intellectual life. If we can 
make this contribution to economic life we shall have secured 
such a hold on the interest of the people as to guarantee every 
necessary financial support. 
Another consideration is the possibility which the movement 
gives of interesting Our young people in the school and also of 
giving the members of the organization, as well as other school 
children some instruction in the elements of agriculture, espec- 
ially if we make intelligent use of the bulletins which are sent out 
from time to time by the general government. 
For this reason I am taking pains to urge all county superin- 
tendents to take hold of this work at once. Those who have
-P-A-G-E-659
— 628 — 
already done so will urge you even more strongly than I, because 
they realize the help it has brought to them directly and indi- 
rectly in their school work. I know our superintendents are, 
for the most part, poorly paid and heavily burdened, and the 
one excuse I have for asking them to assume an additional task 
is the belief that it will make lighter those they are already 
carrying. 
The United States Government keeps a man in the field in 
Tennessee to direct this work, to give suggestions to superin- 
tendents and others interested, and to assist in every possible 
way in organizing. The Government director is H. D. Tate, 
Jackson, Tennessee. Write to him and acquaint him with your 
Jocal situation. He will come to your help, tell you. how to or- 
ganize, how to secure subscriptions for prizes, and give you all 
other necessary directions. If you fail to carefully investigate 
this movement and to consider its practicability in your county 
you will make an unpardonable mistake, and will evince a lack 
of that enterprise and zeal which should characterize the county 
superintendent of schools. ' 
Very truly yours, 
: J. W, BristEr, 
State Superintendent. 
NASHVILLE, TENN., January 31, 1912.. 
To County Superintendents: 
Please send me the names of all towns or cities in your county 
whose public schools are not under the direct control of your 
County Board of Education; that is, of incorporated towns or 
cities which have independent school systems, with town or 
city boards of education, which receive their prorate of school 
fund direct from county trustees. Also indicate which of these 
levy special school tax in addition to general county and State 
school tax. 
Very truly yours, 
J. W. BrisTEr, 
State Superintendent.

NASHVILLE, TENN., March 2, 1912. 
Dear Sir: The annual meeting of the Conference for Educa- 
tion in the South, will be held in Nashville, April 3, 4 and 5, 
1912. 
One of the important matters that will be considered at this 
conference is the rural school situation. The problems of con- 
solidation and transportation of pupils will receive special at- 
tention, as will also courses of study for rural schools and the 
preparation of rural school teachers. It is believed that the 
papers and discussions will be of special interest and value to the 
friends and patrons of the rural school. 
It is especially desirable that there should be a large at- 
tendance of the leading men of the rural districts of the State, and 
we join heartily in the general invitation extended by the con- 
ference, and hope that you will find it convenient to be present 
at the general sessions, and also to attend and participate i in the 
special conferences on rural school problems. 
Very truly yours, 
J. W. BrisTER, 
State Superintendent. 
NASHVILLE, TENN., March 8, 1912. 
To County a and City Superintendents of Middle Tennessee: 
The Middle Tennessee Teachers’ Association will hold its 
annual session April 4, 5 and 6, at Nashville. At the same time 
and place the Conference for Education in the South will be in 
session. 
It has been the custom heretofore, I understand, for county 
and city boards of education to grant holidays on Thursday and 
Friday, with pay, to their teachers who attend the association. 
J hope this can be done this year. The Conference for Educa- 
tion is perhaps the most notable educational gathering that 
meets in the South, and your teachers will have an opportunity 
of hearing addresses and discussions from the leading educators, 
not only of the South, but of the whole country.
-P-A-G-E-661
— 630 — 
In addition to the general sessions there will be special con- 
ferences on matters connected with county high schools, rural 
elementary schools, city schools and normal schools. The 
presence of your teachers at these conferences, and their partici- 
pation in the discussions will result, I am sure, in great benefit 
to the schools which they represent. The time is short and there 
has been delay on the part of the association authorities in bring- 
ing this matter to your attention, but I hope you can take it up 
at once, give wide publicity: to the meeting of the association, 
urge your teachers and school authorities to be present, and 
make the necessary concession to your teachers so that they 
may attend. 
Very truly yours, 
J. W. BristTEr, 
State Superintendent. 
NASHVILLE, TENN., March 4, 1912. 
Dear Sir: We are making a study of the rural school situa- 
tion in Tennessee and desire to ascertain the comparative cost 
and efficiency of the rural schools. We are sending you a blank 
which we prepared for the rural schools, and wish you would 
answer questions 2 to 8, inclusive, and fill out columns 4 to 10, 
inclusive, giving information and statistics for elementary schools, 
grades 1 to 8. 
If we have this information we will be able to tell the cost 
and efficiency of the graded and ungraded country schools as 
compared with the graded schools of the cities. Please help us 
to make this study complete and valuable and let us have the 
information as soon as possible. ,

REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE EXAMINATION AND CERTIFICA- 
TION OF PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS IN TENNESSEE. 
By Section 7, Subsection 9, Chapter 25 of the Acts of 1873, 
it is made the duty of the State Superintendent “To prescribe 
_ the mode of examining and licensing school teachers, and their 
necessary qualifications.’’ Section 9, Subsection 4, makes it 
the duty. of the County Superintendent ‘‘To perform such duties 
in relation to the examination of teachers and issuing of the 
certificates of qualification as‘:may be required of him by the 
State Superintendent.” 
Two kinds of teachers’ certificates are issued in Tennessee— 
State and County. 
STATE CERTIFICATES. 
State Certificates are of two classes—Pimary and Secondary 
Certificates. These are obtained by standing the uniform exami- 
nations prepared by the State Superintendent of Public Instruc- 
tion, and held at the close of the State Institutes. 
The Primary State Certificate is good for one year, and the 
applicant for the same must pass examination on the following 
subjects that are required to be taught in- Primary Public 
Schools: Spelling, Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, Grammar, 
Geography, History of Tennessee, History of the United States, 
Physiology and Hygiene. In addition to the above, he must 
take examination on the books in the State Reading Circle 
Course for Primary Teachers, which, for the current year, are
-P-A-G-E-664
— 633 — 
Chamberlain’s Standards in Education and Kemp’s History for 
Graded and District Schools. 
All persons taking examinations as prescribed above, making 
an average of at least 85 per cent, and not less than 60 per cent 
on any one subject, will be granted State Primary Certificate. 
Two kinds of Secondary Certificates are issued: First Grade 
(Roll of Honor) Secondary Certificate, and the Second Grade 
Secondary Certificate. The first Grade Certificate is good for 
four years, provided the holder does the annual Reading Circle 
work and complies with all other State and local requirements. 
The Second Grade Certificate is good fer one year. It may be 
changed to a first grade by attending a State Institute the fol- 
lowing year, raising grades of previous year satisfactorily and 
meeting other State and local requirements. 
The First Grade Secondary Certificates are granted to per- 
sons taking examination on all subjects in the Public School 
Course, which embraces, in addition to the subjects prescribed 
for the Primary School Course, the following: Geology of Ten- 
nessee, Agriculture, Algebra, Plane Geometry, Physics, Book- 
keeping, Civil Government, Rhetoric, School Law, and the State 
Reading Circle Books, which for the current year are Chamber- 
lain’s ‘‘Standards in Education” and Kemp’s “History for Graded 
and District Schools.” 
Persons taking the examinations as prescribed above, and 
making an average of at least 90 per cent and not less than 70 
per cent on any one subject, are granted First Grade Secondary 
Certificate; those who make a general average of at least 85 
per cent and not less than 60 per cent on any one subject will be 
given a Second Grade Secondary Certificate. . 
All State Certificates are good in any county in the State, 
and holders thereof are entitled to county certificates of the 
same grade, provided they comply with all local requirements. 
It is understood, of course, that there can be no local require- 
ments in conflict with the regulations of the State Superintend- 
ent. : 
County CERTIFICATES. 
Three grades of County Certificates are issued. 
A First Grade County Certificate may be obtained by passing 
examination held by a County Superintendent on all subjects
-P-A-G-E-665
— 634 — 
required to be taught in a Secondary School as named above. 
The applicant must obtain a general average of not less than 85 
per cent and not fall below 60 per cent on any one subject. 
A Second Grade Certificate may be obtained by passing ex- 
amination held by County Superintendent on all the subjects to 
be taught in a Secondary School as named above. The appli- 
cant must obtain a general average of 75 per cent and not fafl 
below 60 per cent on any one subject. 
A Third Grade Certificate may be obtained by passing exami- 
nation held by a County Superintendent on all subjects required 
to be taught in a Primary School as named above. ‘ The appli- 
cant must obtain a general average of not less than 85 per cent 
and not fall below 60 per cent on any one subject. 
RENEWAL OF CERTIFICATES. 
A State Primary Certificate may be renewed for one year, 
provided the holder thereof attends a State Institute for fifteen 
“consecutive days, passes satisfactory examination on subjects 
on which he attained less than 75 per cent at his previous exami- 
nation, studies and passes satisfaactory examination on books in 
Reading Circle Course, takes the Institute Courses in Primary 
work and Domestic Science, and passes satisfactory examination 
thereon or at least two subjects of Secondary Course, to the satis- 
faction of the instructors. 
A State Secondary Certificate, whose term of four years has 
expired, may be renewed for four years, provided the holder has 
taught at least three of the four years, attends a State Institute 
the last year of the period, studies and passes satisfactory exami- 
nation on the books of the Reading Circle Course, and takes the 
Institute work in Agriculture or, Domestic Science, and passes 
examination thereon. : 
No certificate should be renewed if the Superintendent of 
the county in which the holder has taught the’ previous year 
objects because of the failure of the holder to comply with local 
requirements. As stated above, no local requirements can be 
made in conflict with regulations of State Superintendent. 
The purpose of the renewal privilege is not to relieve from 
examination, but to encourage growth on the part of the teacher. 
As long as a holder of a State Certificate continues teaching,
-P-A-G-E-666
— 635 — 
gives evidence of study and professional reading, and proves 
his loyalty to local and State school authorities, it is proper to 
renew. .The State Institutes are designed to furnish opportunity 
‘to teachers for further study and to raise the grade of their cer- 
tificates, and no.teacher should expect a renewal who does not 
take advantage of this opportunity. 
The possession of a State Certificate does not release the holder 
from obligations to County Superintendent and County System 
of Schools. The County Superintendent is head of the County 
Public Schools, and every teacher should loyally co-operate with 
him. It is the duty of all teachers—holders of State as well as 
County Certificates—to attend and participate in regular and 
called County Teachers’ Meetings, to join in the forming of 
reading circles and improvement associations, and everything 
else that is projected for promoting school interests. 
On the other hand, County Superintendents should encourage 
their teachers to aspire to and work for State Certificates, and 
should interpose no objection to renewals, except in extreme 
cases. . 
The granting of State Certificates by the State Institute is 
the nearest approach to uniformity of certification possible under 
present school laws, and uniformity is so desirable that every 
step toward it should be welcomed by all school authorities. If 
the mutual interests of holders of State Certificates and county 
authorities are recognized, there can be no possibility of conflict 
between them. It is earnestly desired by the State Superin- 
tendent that there shall be a growing recognition of these mutual 
interests, and everything possible will be done by him to that 
end. : 
HicH ScHoo. CERTIFICATES. 
Three classes of certificates are issued as follows: 
1. A certificate good for one year in any county of the State, 
renewable annually for efficient and continuous service, will be 
issued on a bachelor’s diploma from a standard college or uni- 
versity, provided the holder thereof presented as many as four- 
teen credits at the time of entrance, did four years’ resident col- 
lege work, and has credits on some professional subject equiva- 
lent to twenty-four weeks, when such diploma and certificate
-P-A-G-E-667
— 636 — 
of entrance requirements and professional work have been ap- 
proved by the State Superintendent and High School Inspector. 
2. A County Certificate, good for. two years in the county in 
which issued, will be given persons making the required grades 
in one or more departments in the county examination. 
3. A State Certificate, good in any county for a period of 
five years and renewable for efficient service, will be given persons 
making the required average in the first five departments. Per- 
sons making the required average in any one or more, but less 
than five, of the departments are given a certificate good for 
three years, and renewable for two years only. 
4. To obtain a certificate, either State or County, one must 
make an average of 85 on all subjects of one or more departments, 
and not fall below 70 on any. 
5. State examinations will be conducted at Jackson, Nash- 
ville and Knoxville by the High School Inspector or a member of 
the State Board of Education. The papers will be graded under 
State authority. 
County examinations will be conducted under the regulations 
of the State Board of Education at the county seat.of every 
county in which there is a high school by a committee composed 
of the County Superintendent and two other capable members 
elected by the County High School Board. Papers will be graded 
by this committee and, with certified statement of grades, filed 
with the High School Inspector. 
6: In 1912 all county and State examinations will be held on 
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, June 11, 12, 18; and Sep- 
tember 3,4, 5. Departments will come in the following order:

Section 26 provides that ‘no teacher of public schools shall 
be employed or receive any pay ftom the public funds unless 
he or she have a certificate of qualification given him or her by 
the County Superintendent for the county within which he or 
she is employed. No such payment, shall be allowed, if made, 
and any officer who shall make or sanction it shall be subject toa 
penalty of not less than Five nor more than Fifty Dollars.” 
The County Superintendents and the County ‘Boards of Educa- 
tion should notify all teachers of the necessity of attending the 
first regular examination, so that they may be on the eligible 
list when the Board of Education meets in July to select teachers. 
The examinations should be reasonable and fair, and the 
grading of papers accurate and just. The responsibility of ex- 
amining and licensing teachers rests upon the County Superin- 
tendent. He is the sole judge of the qualifications of applicants 
for teaching positions. He should take care to license no one 
who is not worthy and well qualified. It is questionable whether 
it is not better to keep the school closed than to have it taught by 
an incompetent teacher. 
County Superintendents are requested to hold public examina- 
tions on the following dates and give no private examinations: 
The first, the annual examination, to be held the first Friday 
and Saturday in July, or at the close of the County. Institute.
-P-A-G-E-669
— 638 — 
The second examination to be held the first Friday and Sat- 
urday in August. 
The third examination to be held the first Friday and Sat- 
urday in October. 
The fourth examination to be held the first Friday and Satur- 
day in January. 
All certificates should be dated July 1, as those dated prior 
to that time expire on January 30 after its issuance. 
DUPLICATING CERTIFICATES. 
It is not a wise policy to duplicate certificates issued by 
Superintendents of other counties. As a rule, the teacher who 
wants a certificate duplicated is one who cannot get a school in 
the county in which it was issued. Furthermore, if he teaches 
in a given county, it is his duty to attend the Institute in that 
county, identify himself with the profession, learn the local con- 
ditions, and take his examination in the county where he is to be 
employed.

State Superintendent. 
NASHVILLE, TENN., April 25, 1912. 
To County Superintendents: 
_ I have thought for some time of suggesting to you a change 
in the time of holding your annual county institutes. Instead of 
holding them in mid-summer and closing with examinations, it 
occurs to me that it would be better to hold them about two 
weeks before the opening of your county schools. If this were 
done, the teachers would go direct from the institutes into the 
school room. Whatever they had acquired during the insti- 
tutes would be of immediate service, and there would not be 
that loss of interest and inspiration which generally results from 
a long interval before the opening of school. 
The General Education Bill, as you know, provides for the 
use of the normal school instructors in County Institutes. These 
instructors will be busily engaged during the summer session of 
the normal schools, but during the latter part of July and August 
they would be at leisure and available for institute work.
-P-A-G-E-670
— 639 — 
I realize that a change of this kind would make it necessary 
to hold your teachers’ examinations at other dates than those 
covered by institutes. This I believe would be a wise thing to 
do. I fear that a number of our county institutes mean to many 
little more than an opportunity forexamination. If the examina- 
tions are held at one time and the institute at another, the real 
purposes of the institute can be better subserved. ~ 
I am not insisting that this change shall be made, but I am 
bringing it to your attention with the hope that you will give it 
careful consideration, and adopt the suggestion if practicable. 
Very truly yours, 
J. W. Bristrr, 
State Superintendent. 
NASHVILLE, TENN., May 18, 1912. 
To County Superintendents: 
This-letter is written to direct your special attention to the 
annual enumeration of school children and to ask that you take 
special pains to secure full, complete and accurate reports. 
I do not know your custom, but I am sure it will be necessary 
to have some communication with your census enumerators, 
either in a conference or by correspondence. Please advise 
them of the desirability and necessity of enumerating every 
child of school age and caution them against inaccuracies. The 
enumerators in the incorporated towns also need to be reminded 
of the importance of this work and I hope you will communicate 
my advice to the town school boards. Let every enumerator 
be reminded that he must make affidavit in due form of law that 
he has taken the census carefully and accurately. Let this im- 
portant part of the enumeration not be neglected, but, as the 
law directs, have the lists properly and legally sworn to. 
Charges, official and unofficial, have been made that certain 
sections, by reason of incorrect census. returns, are getting an 
undue share of school revenues. These charges are being in- 
vestigated and when statistics are available for comparison and 
it then appears that the school population of any section is re- 
ported too large, effort will be made to legally correct it.
-P-A-G-E-671
_ —— 640 — 
Especially do I hope from the record made this summer to 
secure accurate statistics as to illiteracy. The law requires 
that reports be made of all school children unable to read and 
write, and this information must continue to be given; but this 
information is of little value, inasmuch’as many children under 
eight years at least have never been to school—in several cities 
legal regulations exclude them until seven. Even, therefore, 
if the enumération were accurate, no valuable conclusions could 
be drawn from it. I am going to ask those in charge to have 
‘the enumerators enroll at each house all persons ten years of age 
and over who cannot read and write. This will entail no extra 
work and it will give us helpful information. I shall furnish a 
separate form to be given to the enumerators for this. purpose. 
If by this means we can ascertain the number of illiterates and 
their location we will be in possession of data on which to plan 
an active campaign in every county against illiteracy. 
Please let me know at once how many enumeration blanks 
will be needed for your county, including all incorporated cities 
and towns, and how many of the blanks securing data as to il- 
literacy. 
Very truly, 
J..W. BRIsTER, 
State Superintendent. 
NASHVILLE, TENN., May 15, 1912. 
To County Superiniendents: ‘ 
I am writing this letter to you to ask that you investigate 
the condition. of your county as regards illiteracy, particularly 
among adults, and to urge you to project some plans for its 
extinction. 
I have been hoping to get definite statistics covering every 
county in the State from the Census Bureau, but they are not 
yet available. I have, however, sufficient information to know 
that the situation today is not very much better than in 1900. 
The per cent of illiteracy has fallen off slightly, but we do not 
seem to have changed our relative position among the states.
-P-A-G-E-672
— 641 — 
From_advance information from the Census Bureau we find 
that-in. the State-at-large there are 120,966 illiterate native 
whites, ten years of age and over. The entire population of that 
age is 1,210,016, so that 9 9-10 per cent of the native white popu-. 
lation, ten years old and above, is unable to read and write. 
The total population, white and colored, ten years and over, is 
1,621,016; the illiterate among that number 221,071, or 13 6-10 
per cent of the entire population. 
Looking at the situation from another point of view, we find 
that there are 423,319 native adult white males in Tennessee; 
11 3-10 per cent of this number, or 47,743, are unable to read 
and write. That is, one grown white man in every nine in the 
State of Tennessee cannot write his name, or read it when it is 
written. It should be said that this is a slight improvement over 
1900, when 14 1-10 per cent of this population was in the illiterate 
class. 
I have at this time separate statistics from only three counties, 
Davidson, Hawkins and Granger. As soon as other figures come 
I shall get them into the hands of the county superintendents 
without delay. 
What is given above, however, is sufficient to indicate that 
we are failing in our fundamental educational purpose—making 
a literate body of men and women in the State. Whatever else 
we may do in our schools, as long as there is so large a per cent 
of our people not able to read and write, our task is incomplete. 
Democracy is still on trial—there are marty problems confronting 
it, and if it cannot cope with so small a matter as illiteracy, there 
is little hope that it can completely and successfully find a remedy 
for its other ills. : 
I am convinced that the wiping out of illiteracy in Tennessee 
before another census is taken, or at least reducing it to a negli- 
gible quantity, is not an impossible task. If ninety-six county 
superintendents and forty-four city superintendents resolve to 
do the job, the deed is done. No more interesting address was 
delivered at the recent Conference for Education in the South, at 
Nashville—and there were scores of America’s greatest thinkers 
on the program—than the thrilling recital of a frail woman 
superintendent of a Kentucky county of the way in which she 
and her self-sacrificing teachers, backed. up by the patriotic 
at
-P-A-G-E-673
— 642t— 
men and women of her county, had attacked this. problem and 
solved it with reasonable success. 
Here is an opportunity, I believe, for an enterprising county 
superintendent in Tennessee to render incalculable service to his 
State and win for himself a national name and fame. 
Who will be the first to canvass the situation in his county, and 
if it is warranted, undertake this big, but by no means impossible 
task? , : , 
It can be accomplished, I believe, by a whirlwind. campaign. 
The object is so appealing, so full of human interest, that it will 
reach every patriotic man and woman in your county:. The 
preachers will come to your aid, and the churches be converted 
into schools; the teachers will rally to you and give their time 
gratuitously to this service; the professional men and men of 
affairs, the noble women will lend a hand; the newspapers will 
give cordial endorsement and support, and for the time being 
you can have your whole county in school—either as: teachers 
or pupils. Can you conceive of a grander spectacle? 
The direct effects of such a campaign will be important and 
far reaching, but the indirect will be even greater. Such a 
sentiment will be created that the schools will be brought into 
their rightful prominence, the work of the school will be more ap- 
preciated and your county will resolve that never again shall 
such a task be necessary. ‘I believe it will mean compulsory 
education law for the whole State, larger attendance,. more ef- 
fective adult co-operation, more money for educational: purposes, 
and a brighter day for the whole State. 
Yours very truly, 
J. W. BRIsTER, 
State Superintendent. 
NasnHvit_e, TENN., May 18, 1912. 
To County Superintendents: 
I desire to call your attention to your forthcoming annual 
report and to ask that you begin on it early enough to have it in 
my hands not later than August Ist, as required by law.
-P-A-G-E-674
— 643 — 
This year a number of county superintendents failed to send 
in reports until long after the legal date and this failure was 
largely responsible for the belated appearance of the State 
Superintendent’s Annual Statistical Report. The Biennial 
Report, which will be made this year, must be placed in the hands 
of the printer not later than November 15, and to do this your 
report ‘must be on file in my office at the time above stated; 
August Ist. 
Some changes have been made in the forms and the new 
blanks will be sent to you about June 10. Accompanying the 
forms will be a circular letter giving some directions concerning 
the reports. These directions are of the most elementary nature, 
but after one year’s experience with the reports of ninety-six 
county superintendents, I am sure some of them will welcome 
any suggestions. 
Please, every one of you, help me with the report. Let’s 
make it full, complete and accurate. Report every cent of. 
revenue that is used for school purposes. Let’s of course, not 
pad, but make the best showing we possibly can. 
Very truly, 
J. W. BrisTEr, 
State Superintendent. 
NaAsHVILLE, TENN., May 18, 1912. 
Dear Sir: The Agricultural, Educational and Health Train 
will start from Nashville July Ist to make a tour of the State. 
On it the Edugational Department wants to exhibit the public 
schools to’best advantage. I want to give every county an op- 
portunity ‘to make the most attractive exhibit possible. 
There are several ways of making the exhibit, but the best 
is to furnish pictures of the various schools and grounds, showing 
improvements, internal and external. If you have good views 
of special equipment—domestic science, manual training, lab- 
oratories, drinking fountains, etc., please let us have them. If 
you can show a creditable modern school and in'connection with 
it the small school or schools, abandoned to make place for it, 
please do so. We want photos about 11 x 14 inches, if you can 
furnish them.
-P-A-G-E-675
— 644 — 
If it is impossible to furnish a photograph, give us-something, 
if nothing more than a post card. Write to your schools and ask 
them to furnish photographs and pennants. Pennants help 
wonderfully to decorate. We will return them if requested when 
the tour is made. We want pictures of school wagons, school 
play houses and grounds, school apparatus, school everything. 
If you are in doubt about what to send, or want further Mstruc- 
tion, write me. 
If you have other features t to present, or suggestions to make, 
do not hesitate or be backward in the least. We want this to 
be the best display that has ever been made of the public schools 
of any State or country. 
This exhibit on wheels will give all the people an idea of 
what we have and what we need. Let’s have a good exhibit 
from your county. __ 
Yours truly, © 
J. W. BRIsTER, 
State Superintendent. 
NASHVILLE, TENN., June 15, 1912. 
To the Public School Teachers of Tennessee: . 
I desire in this special way to bring to your attention the mat- 
ter of enrollment and attendance in our public schools, and to 
ask that you make special effort to secure a larger enrollment 
and attendance during the coming year than ever before. ° 
The scholastic population of the State is about 756,000; the 
enrollment is 530,000, 70 per cent of the population; the average 
attendance is 360,000, which is 68 per cent of the enrollment, 
and 40 per cent of the scholastic population. It is fair to state, 
however, that these figures are misleading, and conclusions some- 
times drawn from them are erroneous. The scholastic popula- 
tion includes all persons between the ages of six and twenty-one. 
A very large proportion of the enroliment is in the elementary 
schools, necessarily so, for high school opportunities are fur- 
nished in only forty-one counties of the State, and it is not reason- 
able to expect many pupils above 15 or 16 in the elementary, or 
above 18 or 19 in the high schools. Besides, several of the larger
-P-A-G-E-676
— 645 — 
cities of the State place the lower limit of school age at seven, 
so that a considerable number of the local school population is 
cut off in that way. 
The situation, then, is not as bad as it seems, but it is bad 
enough. There is no reason why there should not be enrolled 
at least 96 or 98 per cent of the available school children—from 
7 to 18, and then if we could get from 95 to 98 per cent of the 
enrollment in attendance instead of 68 per cent we will be nearer 
the ideal condition. This will never be brought about, perhaps, 
with our present type of school and present regulations as to 
attendance. If we can establish a good system of consolidated 
schools, with attractive buildings and grounds, and revise our 
course of study in such a way as to relate the school intimately 
to the life of the people, and at the same time can secure the 
passage of a compulsory attendance law; that is, if we can at- 
tract and draw pupils on the one hand and use compulsion on 
those who will give no heed to gentle persuasion on the other, 
we may expect this ideal condition. 
But we cannot afford to wait for this improved condition, 
and as teachers and school officials we can, by proper effort, do 
a great deal towards increasing the enrollment and attendance 
during the coming year. If the public school teachers used half 
the effort to secure pupils as private school teachers, the schools 
would be filled to overflowing. We have not thought it neces- 
sary to do so, we have not considered it our duty. The notion 
has prevailed that the school is for those who attend, that we have 
performed our contract when we have conscientiously taught 
those who come for instruction. But this is by no means the 
whole duty of the teacher; a different conception of the school 
now prevails. From the university to the primary school there 
is a growing tendency to go after the people on the part of the 
university to carry instruction to them; in the lower grades to 
go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come 
in. 
Here, then, is my appeal to the teachers of Tennessee. Go 
after the boys and girls who look to your school for instruction, 
make arrangements to arrive in your school community a week 
or ten days before the opening of school, have a conference with 
some of the leading patrons and school officials, plan a campaign
-P-A-G-E-677
  — 646 — 
te reach the indifferent parents and pupils, ‘find out if possible 
all the children who ought to come to your school and do not be 
content until you have enrolled them or made an honest effort so 
to do. . : 
I know you receive no princely salary, and render large 
service for what you are paid, and I dislike to add ‘to your bur- 
dens, but if you accept the job at all let me urge you to do your 
whole duty and give the educational advantages which your 
scheol affords to every boy and girl in your school community. 
Very truly yours, 
J. W. BrisTER, 
State Superintendent. 
NASHVILLE, TENN., July 17, 1912. 
DEAR Str: We are planning an educational campaign to 
cover every county in the State, beginning Monday, August 19, 
1912. We will be assisted in the campaign by the normal school 
presidents, the high and elementary school inspectors, the 
Professor of Secondary Education in the University of Tennessee, 
members of the State Board of Education, county superintend- 
ents and others whose services we may be able to secure from 
time to time. 
Pertinent educational matters, such as consolidation of 
schools, bond issues for school buildings, rural school super- 
vision, better trained teachers, illiteracy, needed legislation, high 
school development and increased school revenues will be brought 
to the attention of the people. 
The success of the meeting in your county depends upon you. 
Without your sympathetic co-operation, without great activity 
on your part, it will be useless to undertake the work. 
Can’t we have a great rally in your county? Please begin and 
plan for it now. We will declare a holiday for the schools at 
the proper time, and it is hoped that every school will be largely 
represented. But we want the friends and patrons of the school 
and the public generally in attendance, as well as the school 
children and teachers, and it is desired that you will give wide 
publicity to the announcement to this end.

The date for your countyis.........0.........05 We wish 
it were possible to ask you to select the date, but it is.necessary 
to make out a complete itinerary for each grand division, and 
the date in your county has to be chosen so as to fit into the 
general scheme. 
Please advise us at once as to the best place for the meeting, 
considering, of course, accessibility to the speakers as well as 
the people. If possible the place should be on the railroad or 
within reasonable distance. As soon as we get this information, 
the itinerary will be prepared and put into your hands.. 
Counting on your hearty co-operation, I am, 
Sincerely yours, 
J. W. Brister, 
State Superintendent. 
NASHVILLE, ‘TENN., August 12, 1912. 
To County Superintendents: 
I have sent you posters announcing the school rally in your 
county. I suggest that if your rally comes after the middle of 
September; that you do not put up the posters right away. 
You might display some of them now and keep a sufficient 
number to placard your county two or three weeks before the 
date of the rally. If you put them up five or six weeks ahead of 
time they are apt to be destroyed and the date forgotten. 
Please send me at once a complete list of your County Board 
of Education as now constituted; that is, the name and address 
of each member. 
If you have a boys’ corn club in your county I wish you would 
make a report of it at the close of the season; that is, send’ me a 
list of the members, the returns from each boy's acre and any- 
thing else that will be of interest. 
In addition to your statistical report which will be embodied 
in the State Superintendent’s Annual Report, I shall be glad to 
have a general statement from you in regard to the school situa- 
tion in your county, not exceeding two hundred words. Do not 
send a mere summary of statistics, but tell about any new plans
-P-A-G-E-679
— 648 — 
which you have offered during the past year, any improvement in 
your school affairs, or any special features of the school situation 
in your county which you deem worthy of mention.

. NASHVILLE, TENN., October 12, 1912. 
To County Superintendents: 
The State superintendents of ‘the various Southern States 
have agreed to recommend the observance of Wednesday, 
November 27, 1912, as Agricultural Day in all their publicschools. 
The purpose of this movement is to focus attention on the 
country school and country life for one day in every part of our 
section. Suggestive programs are. being arranged containing 
songs, recitations and readings bearing on country life. Boys 
of the corn clubs and girls of the canning clubs will be asked to 
display their products, and all the school activities which center 
in the country will be called into operation in the exercises. 
It is hoped that this observance will grow into an annual 
custom and that some day in November can be agreed upon when 
the millions of school children in the country with their friends 
and parents can come for a few brief hours and consider the‘needs 
peculiar to the country school and country life. - 
A double significance will attach to the Day this year in that 
in connection with the program of country life it is planned to 
commemorate the life and services of Dr. Seaman A. Knapp. 
It is useless to remind you of the value of Dr. Knapp’s work. 
Of all the men of recent years who have contributed ideas of 
vital value to the educational development of the South, he 
stands out prominently. When we have passed through the 
present educational change and have worked out a satisfactory 
country school and have arranged a course of study and activi- 
ties which will thoroughly equip our young people, it will no 
doubt be found that the ideas of ‘Dr. Knapp have given coloring - 
.to the whole scheme. 
But his contribution was not merely an academic one, it 
was directly and immediately of material value. The larger: 
returns from investments of time, labor and money in agricul- 
tural pursuits which are reported from every state, the agricul- 
tural awakening which marks these latter years in every section 
of the South, is due largely to his labors, suggestions and teach- 
ings. It is natural that the South should undertake to pay some 
tribute to the memory of this man, and soon after his death a 
memorial committee was appointed, who, after consultation, 
planned to erect a memorial to him of such a nature as to con- 
serve the great agricultural ideas he had given to the world.
-P-A-G-E-681
— 650 — 
Later the General Education Board set aside $250,000 to endow 
the Seaman A. Knapp School for Country Life as part of the 
George Peabody College for Teachers. The Knapp Memorial 
-Committee thereupon resolved to raise a fund of $150,000 from 
‘the school children and parents of the South to purchase a farm 
and erect a suitable building for carrying on the activities of 
* the Seaman A. Knapp School. 
‘Knapp Agricultural Day in Tennessee and the South this 
year will be utilized to secure this fund. This does not mean 
that the primary purpose is to raise money, the real aim, as 
already suggested, being to study country life, but an incident 
of the gathering is a collection for this great and worthy cause. 
Smali contributions are especially desirable. There are men who 
are willing to give the whole sum, or a large part of it, but the 
committee in charge would much prefer a multitude of nickels 
and dimes and dollars to a few large subscriptions. It has been 
suggested that if desired, the school observing the Day may 
retain half the collection for local purposes, and donate the re- 
mainder to the Knapp Memorial, the part reserved to be used 
in school improvement, purchase of books bearing particularly 
on country life, and supplying other needs of the country school. 
Every county superintendent who has ever organized a 
corn club, or who has realized the benefit of such an organization 
‘ in another country; every boy who has ever been connected with 
acorn club, or every girl who has ever heard of a canning club ; 
every parent who has seen the interest of his children expand 
because of these and kindred organizations; every man, woman 
and child who has felt the stirring of these new movements in 
country life, ought to participate in the program and make the 
Knapp Agricultural Day notable in the educational and material 
development of his community and State. 
Thope that you will take hold of this matter vigorously at once 
and thoroughly organize your county. At the earliest possible 
date have a meeting of your teachers and urge them to observe 
the Day in their school. Suggestive programs will be furnished 
from my office. Every superintendent who will co-operate in 
this movement will do me a favor by communicating with me at 
once. J. W. BRISTER, 
State Superintendent.

BrenniaL EpucaTionat CAMPAIGN UNDER THE DIRECTION OF 
THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PusLic IN- 
' STRUCTION. 
A series of school rallies to cover every county in the State will 
be held during the months of August, September and October. 
The campaign will be carried on simultaneously in each of the 
three grand divisions. Among those who will participate are the 
State Superintendent of Public Instruction, the State High 
School Inspector, the State Elementary School Inspector, Presi- 
dents of the State Normal Schools, the President of the: State 
University and other members of the University faculty, repre- 
sentatives of the State Board of Education, State Board of 
Health, State Department of Agriculture and local school men: 
In the campaign will be discussed such pertinent issues: as 
consolidation of schools and transportation of pupils, professional 
supervision of country schools, bond issues for school building, 
plans for eliminating illiteracy, standardization of teachers’ cer- 
tificates, the high and normal school situation, needed legisla- 
tion, increased school revenues—all for the purpose of informing 
the people on these subjects, and enlisting their sympathy and 
support in every movement for educational advancement. 
It is hoped that each County Superintendent will personally 
direct the rally in his county, plan for the attendance of. his 
schools, advertise the meeting thoroughly, and leave no effort 
undone to secure a large and representative attendance of all 
. classes of citizens. , 
The following schedule of appointments will be observed:

CLOSING OF SCHOOLS. 
By authority conferred on me by law, the public schools of 
the county will be suspended on the day of the rally, and teachers 
in attendance will receive pay for the day according to the terms 
. of their contract. 
It is hoped that teachers, pupils, school officers, and the public 
generally will attend, and that we can make this campaign 
notable in the educational history of the State. 
J. W. BristEr, 
State Superintendent.

NAsHVILLE, TENN., October 26, 1912. 
To County Superintendents— 
We have just concluded the Biennial Educational Campaign. 
Meetings have been held in every county, and we have en- 
deavored to present vital school matters in a practical way, with 
certain ‘constructive proposals for improving conditions ‘ that 
now exist. 
We want to continue this work; not in a general way, but to 
assist in working out certain definite plans. County Superin- 
tendents, with their knowledge of local conditions are in posi- 
tion to determine what ought to be the next forward step in 
their respective counties. Those of you who are not content 
with ‘present conditions, who want to do something besides the 
mere routine duties of your office, and who have in mind definite - 
plans for school‘improvement, can command our services. We 
are not seeking invitations for general educational meetings, 
but if you have some special object in view, some particular 
thing you ‘want to accomplish, we are willing and anxious to 
co-operate. 
Let me illustrate. All during this campaign, in fact, during 
the entire administration, we have tried to focus attention on 
the country school,.and we have emphasized the need of a new 
type of country school—the centralized or consolidated school, 
with proper transportation facilities provided. It has never 
been thought that consolidation is a panacea for all our school 
ills, but it is believed, confidently believed, that this type of 
school offers the opportunity’ for solving most of our country 
school problems, and it is the only way by which we can hope 
to have an adequate system of public instruction for the country 
districts. 
With such a belief it is natural that we should hope to have 
many counties enter upon the policy of consolidation during the 
next few:months; to follow the lead of Shelby and Madison, to 
give the new plan a trial as Weakley, Cheatham and Rhea are 
doing, for the first time, this, year. 
We are anxious to aid any county superintendent ‘in a work 
of this kind. After a careful consideration of the proposal and 
a study of your local conditions, do you know of a community 
in your county where the new school could be inaugurated to
-P-A-G-E-687
— 656 — 
advantage? If you have such a situation, the Department would 
like to assist, by sending some one to plan a campaign with you— 
to go into the community, discuss with the people the general 
policy, set forth the advantages of the new type of school and 
prepare the way for a first-class centralized country school, 
within easy reach, because of transportation facilities provided, 
of every boy and girl who ought to attend. 
Or have you other plans in mind? Are you thinking of work- 
ing for a bond issue for school building, a tax for high school 
purposes, the enlargement of your high school plant or enrich- 
ment of its course of study, of increased local revenues. for the 
elementary schools, or of the appointment of supervisors for any 
department of school work in your county? If you have any 
. special object towards which you are working, and you think the 
Department can help, don’t hesitate to call upon us, and we will 
render every service possible. 
But let me repeat, we want something definite and clear cut 
for which to work, something that you have thought of as neces- 
sary to be done and which you believe is practicable and possible 
at this time. 
We must be up and doing.. We cannot stand still. There is 
need of school improvement in every county. What are your 
plans for your particular county? 
Very truly yours, 
J. W. BristTER, 
State Superintendent.

- GENERAL STATEMENT. 
* The time has not come to altogether discontinue Institute 
work in Tennessee. Some of the Normal Schools are in opera- 
tion, and teachers are urged to attend their summer-sessions, or
-P-A-G-E-698
— 667 — 
that of the State University, or some other good summer school. 
When this is impossible, they are urged to take the next best 
opportunity for improvement, which is offered in the State In- 
stitute. 
The one purpose of the Institute is to help teachers to become 
better teachers. The association and conference of large num- 
bers of them for three or four weeks, the study of their common 
problems, the review of their work under competent insfructors, 
must result in general improvement and inspiration. 
It is to be hoped that the matter of examination and certi- 
fication can be kept in the background. If the Institutes are 
regarded only’as opportunities to secure certificates, and teachers 
attend primarily for that purpose, there is no sound reason for 
their continuance. It should be understood that the Institutes 
are held to benefit the teachers, not merely to examine them, and 
the matter of certificates is incidental. . 
Instruction will be given in the public-school “branches as 
far as possible; but it is not to be a mere review to secure the 
content of the subjects. The emphasis is to be placed upon their 
pedagogical aspects; and instructors will endeavor to set forth 
the best method of imparting instruction, illustrating in their 
own presentation the principles underlying good teaching. The 
subject-matter will not be ignored, but sufficient opportunity 
will be given to refresh the minds of those desiring to take exami- 
nation. , 
CouRsEs oF STUDY. 
“Two courses of study are offered—Primary and Secondary. 
The Primary embraces most of the subjects required in the pri- 
mary public school, and the Secondary, those of the secondary 
school. In both courses are included the Reading Circle books, 
which, for the current year, are Chamberlain’s “Standards in 
Education” and Kemp’s “History for Graded and Elementary 
Schools.” 
New FEATURES. 
Serious endeavor will be made this summer to improve gen- 
erally the work of the Institutes. The courses heretofore’offered
-P-A-G-E-699
— 668 — 
are to be'strengthened as far as possible and. new features added, 
which should appeal strongly to public-school teachers. All of 
the instructors have been selected with great care, and it is be- 
lieved they are thoroughly qualified in their respective subjects. 
The primary work is in charge of an expert and successful teacher 
in that department. The instructors in agriculture will remain 
through the whole period instead of three weeks, as heretofore. 
For the first time some instruction in domestic science is to 
be offered in the Institutes. It is realized, of course, that it must 
be of the most elementary chatacter; the aim is to give teachers 
an introduction to this most important subject with the hope of 
inducing them, wherever possible, to use it, in order to vitalize 
their school work, and in some instances to inspire them to further . 
pursue it. It is unnecessary to remind teachers of the general 
interest in these subjects in our State and all over the country. 
The time is upon us when they must find a place in all our schools, 
and the opportunity to those prepared to teach them is most 
promising. : 
ADULT SCHOOL. 
Plans are on foot to induce the farmers and patrons of the 
school in the counties adjoining the Institutes to attend them 
during two or three days when there will be some lectures de- 
livered of interest to school people and the general public. A 
great deal is said these days about making the school the center 
of community life, and this idea can be fostered in no better way 
‘than by bringing teachers and the general public together to dis- 
cuss common problems which will force them to realize their 
identity of interests. During the period of two or three days 
which will be set apart for this purpose the Department of Agri- 
culture and Health will co-operate with the Department of Edu- 
cation and will send lecturers to the Institutes who will be of real 
service to those who are in attendance. By the Department of 
Health will be given lectures on sanitation and hygiene as applied 
to the home as well as the school, and on some of the common 
diseases and methods of prevention. The Agricultural Depart- 
ment will send a group of men to talk to the farmers on matters 
of vital interest to them, not merely ijn a general way, but for 
purposes of instruction. The local authorities will be asked to
-P-A-G-E-700
take charge of this special period, give wide publicity to it, and 
endeavor to make it a most valuable feature of the Institute. 
EXAMINATIONS AND CERTIFICATES. 
In the absence of a better method of State examination and 
certification, examinations will be held at the close of the State . 
Institutes to allow teachers to qualify for State certificates. 
All persons who are in attendance at least fifteen days and pass 
examination in the primary course, making an average of at 
least 85 per cent and not less than 65 per cent on any one subject, 
will be granted the State Primary Certificate. Two kinds of 
Secondary Certificates are issued: First Grade (Honor Roll) 
Certificates, good for four years, are granted to those who attend 
the State Institute at least fifteen days, pass an examination in 
the Secondary Course, making an average of at least 90 per 
cent and not less than 70 per cent on any one subject; the Second 
Grade, to those who are in attendance the same length of time 
and will make an average of at least 85 per cent and not less than 
60 per cent on any one subject of the Secondary Course. 
RENEWAL OF CERTIFICATES. 
Teachers holding State Primary Certificates may have the 
same renewed for one year, provided they attend a State In- 
stitute for at least fifteen days, pass satisfactory examination on 
subjects on which they obtained less than 75 per cent at.former 
examination, pass satisfactory examination on books of the 
Reading Course for the current year, take the Institute courses in 
primary work and domestic science and pass satisfactory exami- 
nation thereon or do work in at least two subjects of the Secondary 
Course to the satisfaction of their instructors. Holders of State 
Secondary Certificates may have the same renewed by attending 
the Institute for at least fifteen days, doing satisfactory work in 
the courses of Agriculture or Domestic Science and passing satis- 
factory examination on the Reading Circle books. 
In all the examinations uniform questions will be used, pre- 
pared by the State Superintendent.

NASHVILLE, TENN., December 27, 1911. 
To Members of the County Court: 
I understand that your County Superintendent is going to 
ask you to vote a bond issue and an increased tax levy for school 
purposes at the coming January term of your court. -The bond 
issue will’be in accordance with Chapter 60, Public School Acts, 
1911, which authorizes county courts to issue bonds for building 
and furnishing school houses. 
I am not thoroughly familiar with your local situation, but 
I am sufficiently informed to know that better school-houses and 
equipment are badly needed. I know, too, that it is unwise and 
unfair to depend upon the ordinary school fund for this purpose; 
unwise, because:the amount available is so meager that the build- 
ing that may be done with it is haphazard, indifferent and of 
temporary value; unfair, because even a small subtraction from 
the school fund results in shortening the school term. 
Building and equipment are permanent improvements, and 
the cost of the same ought to be distributed over a series of years 
and not be allowed to fall upon any particular year. It is not 
right to take the cost of building out of the school fund, and thus 
make the children of one year pay for buildings which are to be 
used for many years. Issue these bonds, payable years hence, 
erect suitable buildings, improve your educational system, give 
your boys and girls proper educational advantages, and it will 
be easier for them as men and women to pay the bonds’‘than it is 
to pay now for unsatisfactory buildings out of their inadequate 
school funds. ‘
-P-A-G-E-702
— 671 — 
As I stated before, I am not familiar with your local situation, 
and would not presume to ask you to do an unwise thing; but I 
do ask you to give this matter serious consideration and if con- 
ditions warrant it vote this bond issue in January. If you will 
do this, and at the same time can increase your tax levy to 50 
cents so as to lengthen your school term, you will have taken the 
proper steps to put your county in the forefront educationally, 
and will have rendered a signal service to your boys and girls, 
and in fact to all the people of the county; and I believe the result 
will be beneficial not merely to your educational interests but to 
, all the interests, material and otherwise, of the county and State. 
Many other counties are considering the proposition to vote 
bonds on this same day, and I hope it is going to.be a great day in 
the history of the State. . 
Yours truly, 
J. W. Brister, 
State Superintendent.

DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 
NasHvItie, Tenn., December 15, Igit. 
To His Excellency, Ben W. Hooper, Governor of Tennessee. 
In compliance with Section 7, Chapter 25, of the Acts of 1873, 
I herewith submit the annual statistical. report of the Depart- 
ment of Public Instruction for the year ending June 30, I911. 
I did not enter upon the duties of the office of State Super- - 
intendent of Public Instruction until April 20, 1911, consequent- 
‘ly: this report deals with statistics of the last year’s work of my 
predecessor. 
I suppose I repeat the testimony of former Superintendents 
in calling attention to the difficulty in securing accurate reports 
from the various counties of the State. In some cases the trou- 
ble is due to defects in the blanks furnished by the State De- 
partment of Public Instruction; in others to the County Super- 
intendents themselves, but in most cases to the apparent lack of 
system in the keeping of financial records in many counties. It_ 
has been necessary to return a number of the reports, some of 
them several times; and in many cases to furnish from: the 
Comptroller’s office a statement of the apportionments which 
have been made by the State to the counties. I am sure that 
there is urgent necd of some systematic method of ‘account- 
keeping by all county officials, certainly by those who handle 
State money belonging to the public schools. The difficulty in 
getting accurate reports is’ responsible for the belated appear- 
ance of these annual statistics. I may say that the blanks fur- 
nished by! the State Department will be modified for the com- 
ing year, and it is hoped that the report for the year ending 
June 30, 1912, can be made more accurate and satisfactory. 
I regret to state that too much reliance cannot be placed on 
the statistics herein given; and conclusions drawn therefrom 
are apt to be misleading. There has been a feeling all through 
the compilation, and especially in arriving at some of the aver- 
ages, that the figures finally given are at best only approxi- 
mations. I should hesitate to make this confession had I not 
recently been in a conference of State Superintendents and 
learned that our experience in Tennessee is by no means unique. 
Reports show that we are just about holding our own educa- 
tionally, especially in matters connected with the elementary 
schools, and. this is what we might have expected. While the
-P-A-G-E-731
—da_ 
  “normal schools, city schools, and high schools are making sub- 
stantial progress, the rural elementary schools are marking time. 
The statistics given here do not go into detail concerning city 
schools. It is to be regretted that | they do not; but there seems 
‘noeway of getting statistics from them unless the pride of the 
city school official prompts them to respond to our appeal. The 
Normal schools were not in operation in 1910-11 and of course 
no report from them appears herein. The Biennial Report to 
be made at the close of the present year will be more compre- 
hensive, will include detailed statements concerning all the edu- 
cational agencies of the State, and will furnish more adequate 
basis for comparison with other periods and other states. 
The tables are as complete and accurate as is possible under 
the circumstances, and the summaries including data for the two 
years, 1909-10 and 1910-11, furnish an easy method of compari- 
son; but it may not be amiss to briefly comment on them. 
The scholastic population is considerably less than was re- 
ported the previous year—to be exact 11,186—but in one county 
alone the decrease reported is 28,909; so that for the rest of 
the State there is an increase’ as large in proportion perhaps as 
the general population has advanced, according to the figures 
of United States Census of 1910. There seems to be no doubt 
that the reports from the county referred to have been too high 
for several years; and it is very probable that the figures now 
given are approximately correct. [ fear that a careful examina- 
tion of thé reports will show too large a scholastic population. 
for several other counties: As soon as comparative statistics are 
available this examination will be made, and if there are errors. 
steps will be taken to correct them. I am convinced that greater 
safeguards should be thrown around the enumeration of the 
school children of the State to the end that the school revenues 
may be justly and fairly apportioned; and-I would like to sug; 
gest at the proper time some modification of the law governing 
the school census. 
Some explanation should be made of Table Il which shows 
the number of school children between the ages of six and twen- 
ty-one that can read and write. The report of the preceding 
year gives 694,859 as the grand total of this Table, while the 
present report shows only 550,070. This difference is so great 
that investigation was made, and a typographical error was dis- 
covered to the effect that the preceding table should have been 
only 594,859. It may be noted further that that report includes 
60,938 from Shelby County. No figures from that county ‘ap- 
pear in the report of this year because no statistics were fur- 
nished. With these corrections it is evident that the new fig- 
ures show a reasonable advance over the preceding year. 
Tt is impossible to certify to the accuracy: of this table; indeed 
thére is good reason to suspect that it is not at all-reliable. It 
 
-P-A-G-E-732
—29— 
is true that many children under eight years have never been 
to school and in. most cases cannot read and write; but it is in- 
conceivable that 26 per cent of the school population of the 
State is illiterate. | : 
Tables Iil and IV, dealing with enrollment and attendance, 
show very little change from the previous year. I may call-at- 
tention to the fact that conclusions sometimes drawn from a 
comparison of our population and enrollment statistics are er- 
roneous and discreditable to the State. We include in the 
scholastic population all persons between the ages of six and 
twenty-one. A very large proportion of the enrollment is in 
the elementary school, necessarily so, for high school oppor- 
tunities are furnished in only forty-one counties of the State; 
and it is not reasonable to expect many pupils above fifteen or 
sixteen in the elementary, or above eighteen or nineteen in. the 
high school. Further, several of the larger cities of the State 
place the lower limit of school age at seven, so that a consid- 
erable number of the legal school population is cut off in that 
way. Our enrollment for 1910-11 is approximately 70 per cent 
of the population, but it is fair to assume that it is nearer 80 
. per cent of the population that may be enrolled. The situation 
then is not as bad as it seems, but it is bad enough. There is 
no reason why there should not be enrolled at least 96 or 98 
per cent of the available school children—-from seven to eigh- 
teen. And then, if we could get 95 to 98 per cent of the enroll- 
ment in attendance, instead of 68 per cent as this report shows, 
we would be nearer the ideal condition. I fear this can never 
be brought about without some form of compulsory attendance 
law. We need of course to vitalize our course of study, to make 
the school more interesting and attractive, but even after this 
is done there are some parents so indifferent and others so pos- 
sessed of cupidity that it will be necessary for the State to exert 
its authority to make it possible for every boy and girl to enjoy 
the educational advantages which it has forced its taxpayers to 
provide. 
«It will be noted that the length of school term in the rural 
districts as given in this report shows a decrease, being 114 days 
as against 121 days for the preceding year. I called the atten- 
tion of my predecessor to this decrease and he reminded me of 
the fact that State funds available for school purposes for the 
year 1909-10 were considerably in excess of those of 1910-1T 
because of a legislative change. It will be recalled that the dis- 
tribution of the State school fund was under the Chestnut Bill 
prior to the General Education Bill. The former provided for 
an annual distribution in January of 75 cents per capita of 
school population. Under this law a distribution was made in 
January, 1909. The General Assembly of that year passed-the 
General Education Bill, changing to a semi-annual distribution,
-P-A-G-E-733
+ —30— 
arid dividing the school. fund among various educational agencies 
of the State. In July following a distribution was’ made un- 
der the new law; and as the July apportionment is always 
much larger than the January apportionment, being prac- 
tically twice as great, it happened that the elementary schools 
received the larger part of two years’ state money in one year. 
As subsequent developments show these funds were not pro- 
rated by local officials over the period involved, the school re- 
ceipts for the ensuing year for rural schools were less, and in 
consequence: the term was shorter. It is true that the figures 
show a larger State distribution for the year ending June 3o, 
1911; but these figures do not count the 75 cents distribution of 
January, 1909, which was credited to the year 1908-9, when in 
fact the larger part of it was used for 1909-10. 
Another fact needs to be taken into consideration in this con- 
nection; from year to year better school facilities are being de- 
manded, and more of the school revenues are being consumed 
sin building, repairing and equipping houses, all of which.is done 
at the expense of the school term. { have heard a score of 
County Superintendents remark during the last few months, “We 
have had to shorten our term this year,” and when pressed for 
an explanation the reply invariably has been, “We have had to 
use so much money for necessary repairs and building.” As 
long as this custom continues it will be impossible to provide 
an adequate length of school term. As suggested above, the de- 
mand for better material surroundings is growing, necessarily 
so, because of the improved home conditions in the State, but 
this demand ought not to be met out’ of the small school fund 
of a particular year. It needs no argument to show that the 
burdén of permanent improvement ought not to fall on one year 
but be distributed over a series of years. Fortunately a method 
of obviating the difficulty remarked on and distributing the bur- 
_den has been provided in the bill passed by the last legislature 
allowing County Courts to issue school bonds for school build- 
ing and equipment. I believe that the wisdom of this legisla- 
tion will become more and more apparent in the coming years. 
If the law is taken advantage of and a reasonable building fund 
is placed at the disposal of County Boards of Education, a gen- 
eral plan of educational development can be projected which 
under present circumstances is practically impossible. In every 
section of the State educational authorities are planning to se- 
cure these bond issues. The State Department is co-operating 
with the County Superintendents in every way possible, for it is 
believed to be a most effective manner of supplementing local’ 
funds, and will leave the local taxation to be used for ordinary 
running expenses. 
The financial tables of this report show a reasonable advance 
over the preceding year, but the headings under which the dif-
-P-A-G-E-734
  a 
ference receipts are grouped are so indefinite that it is impos- 
sible to make any valuable comparisons. It is more than rea- 
sonable to conclude that if the report were thoroughly analyzed 
it would be found that the increase is in the city and high schools. 
I desire to say in this connection that the necessity for larger 
revenues for school purposes is apparent to every student of our 
educational situation. I do not agree with the conclusions of 
some educators that the school problem is merely a financial one, 
but I am sure that adequate revenues would enable us to solve 
a great many of the problems that are pressing upon us. The 
General Education Bill was a wise and statesmanlike measure. 
Tt served to unify the State school system and to make pro- 
vision for all the educational agencies of the State. It was ex- 
pected by those who projected the bill that 33 1-3 per cent of 
the State’s revenues would be available for school purposes, and 
it is still felt that that amount would be a reasonable appropria~ 
tion from the State. It is generally known that but for a parlia- 
mentary technicality of the last General Assembly the school 
system of the State would today be receiving the increased State 
appropriation. It is to be hoped that the educational sentiment 
will be as strong in the coming legislature as the last and that 
this increase may be secured. As to local revenues it is safe to say 
that there is a growing sentiment in favor of increasing them. 
During the last few months notable advances have been made 
in a number of counties, and others are planning for them in 
the immediate future with every prospect of success. : 
In conclusion it may not be amiss for me to remark even in 
this statistical report that of all our educational agencies the 
‘rural elementary school is most deserving of interest. The su- 
preme duty of the hour educationally in Tennessee is towards 
this institution, and I shall be satisfied if I can help to focus at- 
tention and interest thereon during my administration. This does 
not mean that any of the other schoo] interests of the State are 
to. be neglected, but only that greater efforts are to be made in 
behalf of this particular one; not that less attention is to be 
given the former, but more attention and study to the latter. 
It should be added that the rural school problem is not peculiar 
to,, Tennessee; the whole South, the entire nation is confronted 
with it, and the educational leadership of the country is bent 
upon its solution. Too long it has been unconsciously neglected 
and other phases of school work have been so completely in the 
thought of educators that only recently have they awakened to 
the fact that the rural school is far behind other educational 
agencies; and with this rude awakening comes the realization of 
the tremendous importance of the institution and the absolute 
necessity for resuscitating it—not for educational purposes alone, 
but also because of its great significance in current economic 
and moral questions. It is too early to formulate a complete
-P-A-G-E-735
—32— 
program of improvement and development; in fact the matter 
has not received sufficient study from educational experts. to 
justify a thoroughly satisfactory plan; but I bélieve it is safe 
to affirm that there is practical unanimity among school men 
on certain points. It is generally agreed that in all the plans 
for rural school development two considerations are of first im- 
portance : : 
1. A general one—to give a rural coloring to all rural school 
work, to the end that boys and girls shall be held to the farm. 
2. A more particular one—to give vocational training in those 
occupations peculiar to country life, 
In the endeavor to fit the rural school to accomplish these 
aims and to function satisfactorily for country life, it is felt— 
1. That there is need of providing a larger school unit for 
teaching purposes. To do this consolidation of schools with 
transportation of pupils in being urged. 
2. That more adequate supervision is indispensable. 
3. That there is need of special courses of study for teachers 
preparing for rural schools. It is not sufficient merely to es- 
tablish normal schools, or merely to train teachers—but they must 
be trained for some particular line of work; and the rural 
schools are so much in need of a trained teaching force that 
the teacher training agencies of the State ought to be directed 
primarily to this particular end. 
4. That the course of study in the rural schools owght to be 
vitalized, more directly related to rural life. 
This is not the place to give details of the plans we have in 
mind, but I beg.to give assurance that they are being worked 
out, and it is believed that they will in part at least be adapted 
to the ends desired. 
Respectfully submitted, 
J. W. Brister, 
State Superintendent.

REPORT OF STATE HIGH SCHOOL INSPECTOR 
To the State Board of Faducation:. 
I beg to submit herewith the statistics of the County High Schools for the year ending 
June 30, 1911. On account of the failure of one County to report, all totals are slightly

INTRODUCTION 
“Vigorous muscular work is the foundation of health.” 
Physical education is an essential part of education. Like all forms 
of education, it must continually adjust itself to the changing conditions 
of life. It should never be an end in itself, but should always-strive to 
further the accepted aims of general education. The modern teacher of 
physical education should look upon bodily exercises as tools by means 
of which definite worthwhile tendencies within the child may be 
developed. 
From this viewpoint physical education as a school subject has 
certain definite functions. It should, first, provide conditions that will give 
the child the opportunity to indulge in vigorous physical activities that are 
satisfying in themselves. It should next create conditions that will help 
the child to develop mentally by means of self-expressive activities. And 
finally, it should endeavor to place the child in situations that will favor its 
growth as a social being.

  PHYSICAL TRAINING LESSONS 
PART | 
THE TEACHER’S PROBLEM IN GRADED SCHOOLS. 
The class that is to receive a physical education lesson is, as a rule, 
composed of boys and girls, with an age variation of three to five years. 
Their physical development varies, perhaps, still more. Seldom does a 
class present any evidence of an even physical, mental, or social develop- 
ment. Yet, this is the class that is to receive a physical training lesson in 
a very short period of time and quite often in surroundings that would tax 
the ingenuity of an expert. 
Fortunately, physical education is not like the ordinary school sub- 
jects. It does not consist of constantly learning new things. In fact, for 
physical training purposes many of the simplest bodily exercises are as 
valuable for a strong adult as for a weak child. What is needed on the 
part of the teacher is a clear understanding of the aims of physical educa- 
tion, so that the exercises selected for a class with such varied abilities may 
produce results that harmonize with the aims of education in general. 
THE AIMS THAT SHOULD GUIDE THE SELECTION OF 
MATERIAL 
The aims in physical education work should be: 
(a) To give in a suitable environment, to every group of pupils, 
vigorous muscular work of a type that is inherently interesting to that 
group. 
(b) To select such types of work as may also be used to de- 
velop within the child a disposition to strive for high social ideals. 
(c) To use at opportune times types of work that develop within 
the child the power of quick and accurate thinking and doing. 
(d) To give preference to types of work which lead to the acquire- 
ment of skill that is useful for recreational ends. 
[1]
-P-A-G-E-12
  Z PHYSICAL TRAINING LESSONS 
THE PHYSICAL TRAINING LESSON 
Educational procedures are always influenced by the facilities at the 
disposal of the teacher. There are few places in our country where at 
present the teacher has even fair facilities for adequate physical education 
work. Physical training lessons, therefore, in many cases must be modi- 
fied to suit school conditions. Experience, however, has taught that the 
following type of lesson will yield good results if the teacher stresses the 
desirable points spoken of in the aims. 
Part |. (a) Simple marching exercises. ‘The main object of 
tactic exercises is to get the pupils to move in an orderly manner from one 
type of work to another in the shortest possible time. ‘These exercises 
should take but a few minutes. It is wise to demand unquestioned obedi- 
ence and promptness during this part of the lesson. There will be no 
trouble in getting this if the teacher knows what she wants, if she does not 
try to get too much, and if the commands are given in a cheerful and 
spirited manner. 
(b) A short drill composed primarily of vigorous trunk exercises 
and jumping exercises. Att times these exercises may be done with wands 
or dumb-bells. The main object of this drill is to relieve cramped muscles 
and to improve circulation. However, the fact must not be overlooked 
that under a good teacher a drill of this kind is enjoyed by the child (and 
also by the adult), as it gives an opportunity to participate with others in 
vigorous rhythmical movements. If enough space is available, a short run 
will often produce the same effect. 
Part 2. This is the main part of the lesson and it should consist 
of one or more of the following types of work: a game, a track event, 
a field event, apparatus work or other stunts, a folk dance, antagonistics. 
If several types of work are selected in this part of a lesson, it is wise to 
take the more vigorous type first and follow by a less strenuous exercise. 
THE PLACE FOR EXERCISING 
Physical training lessons should be given out of doors. There will 
be days, however, when some indoor facilities must be used. If anything 
is to be accomplished that deserves the name of physical training, a large, 
open, indoor space that allows much freedom of movement must be 
available. Classrooms or corridors are such poor substitutes for outdoors 
that they should never be considered for physical training purposes. 
There are, however, at the present time schools with such poor 
facilities that there is no gymnasium, or play room, or even an adequate
-P-A-G-E-13
  PHYSICAL TRAINING LESSONS 3 
corridor that-can be used for physical training purposes. Under such 
conditions the pupils should be allowed to rise and stretch themselves. 
At times a relief drill as outlined on page 135, or simply marching or 
skipping might be used to relieve the cramped organs of the pupils. No 
teacher understanding the threefold aim outlined above should make the 
mistake of calling this relief work a physical training lesson. 
LEADERSHIP 
The teacher should use pupils as leaders as soon as this is possible. 
Even young children can often be used as leaders or captains of squads. 
In this course of study it is assumed that the pupils will do practically all 
the measuring in the track and field events and enter the results of tests on 
the captains’ sheets. In games the more efficient pupils should be used as 
referees or umpires. In apparatus work and other stunts, leaders are 
necessary to show the exercises, as well as to guard against accidents. In 
folk dances the better pupils should be used to lead the dance. 
The organization of safety patrols, of sanitary squads, etc., presents 
opportunities for developing desirable character traits. It must be the 
constant endeavor of the teacher to encourage the development of 
initiative and the power to lead, wherever there are indications of such 
tendencies. 
APPARATUS WORK AND STUNTS 
Modern living conditions give to growing boys and girls few oppor- 
tunities for “trying out” things. Exercises on apparatus, and stunts of 
all kinds give to children opportunities for self-testing. A piece of 
apparatus has, as such, no interest for the child. The apparatus is simply 
an instrument, a means of allowing the child to test and carry out its own 
desires. It creates conditions for self-expressive activity, and because of 
this it is an essential part of the equipment in the modern school. 
As soon as children feel strong enough they begin to try all kinds of 
stunts. ‘Their first attempts usually are upon things from which they can 
hang and swing; then come appliances that allow them to support them- 
selves upon their hands, or that allow balancing. As they grow stronger 
and more agile they take up and find great delight in those free stunts 
upon the ground known as “‘tumbling.”” This delight in doing stunts upon 
apparatus and upon the ground persists until late in life. 
If there is an opportunity to encourage climbing—perhaps a porch 
or fire escape support, a giant stride or a swing upright, or a slim tree—a  
-P-A-G-E-14
  4 PHYSICAL TRAINING LESSONS 
teacher should have climbing as an event for one squad while the rest of 
the pupils are busy at a game or some other activity. 
Another event that always arouses interest, especially among boys, 
is chinning. A chinning bar can easily be erected by the boys in a door- 
way, or other available place. The chinning bar or a vertical ladder 
may be used to see how many times the pupils are able to raise their knees, 
or their straight legs, or to see who can hold his legs forward for the’ 
greatest length of time. 
Vaulting over a low fence or other obstruction is another form of 
applied physical training that may be practiced in many places. 
The teacher should encourage all such efforts, but keep a watchfu: 
eye and a restraining influence upon those pupils who are too ambitious 
As many of these exercises lead to inverted positions, girls when takin, 
part in them should wear either bloomers or “knickers.”

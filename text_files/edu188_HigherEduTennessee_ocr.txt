  LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL. a 
DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, 
BUREAU OF EDUCATION, 
Washington, D. C., January 3, 1893, 
Str: The accompanying monograph on higher education in Tennes- 
see is one of the series of monographs on education in the various 
States, edited by Dr. Herbert B. Adams and published by the Bureau 
of Education. The author is Dr. L. 8. Merriam, lately a student and 
fellow in Johns Hopkins University. For a résumé of higher educa- 
tion in Tennessee I refer you to Chapter I, pages 1-11. The mono- 
graph, besides treating of higher education proper, contains also a 
chapter on the public school system of Tennessee, written by Mr. T. P. 
Thomas. I respectfully recommend that this monograph be published. 
at the earliest possible date.

‘ AUTHOR’S PREFATORY NOTE. 
I take advantage of this opportunity to express my sense of obliga- 
tion to Mr. T. C. Karns, professor in the University of Tennessee; Mr. 
W. P. Trent, professor in the University of the South, and Mr, T. P. 
Thomas, fellow in Vanderbilt University, for preparing, respectively, 
the chapters on the University of Tennessee, the University of the 
South, and the Public School System of Tennessee. Z 
It would be impossible to thank by name all who have rendered 
assistance or furnished information in the preparation of this mono- 
graph. But for the kindly codperation of these many friends, mostly 
college officers, it could not have been written. I shall, however, men- 
tion two gentlemen by name, Dr. J. Berrien Lindsley, ex-chancellor of 
the University of Nashville, and Dr. W. M. Baskerville, professor in 
Vanderbilt University. Dr. Lindsley put at my disposal his very val- 
uable collection of materials on the history of the University of Nash- 
ville, besides affording other assistance, and Dr. Baskerville read and 
corrected my MS. on Vanderbilt University. 
For purposes of convenience, bibliographies are appended to the 
histories of their corresponding institutions instead of being collected 
in one place at the end of the volume. College announcements and 
registers are not mentioned, as their use may in general be taken for 
granted, Neither, of course, are mentioned such sources of informa- 
tion as epistolary correspondence or personal interviews.

BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF THE AUTHOR. 
Lucius Salisbury Merriam, the author of the following monograph, was born 
January 20, 1867. He was drowned in Cayuga Lake, near Ithaca, N. Y., Novem- 
ber 18, 1893. The proof sheets of this report were read by him early in the preced- 
ing summer. His untimely death was widely mourned by friends and scholars 
throughout the country, in which he was already favorably known by reason of his 
able contributions to economic science. 
He was educated in the high school at Chattanooga, Tenn.; at Vanderbilt Uni- 
versity, where he was graduated in 1889; and at the Johns Hopkins University, 
where he took the degree of doctor of philosophy in June, 1893. Before coming to 
Baltimore he held a graduate fellowship at his alma mater from 1889 to 1890. 
When Prof. E. W. Bemis was called from Vanderbilt, in 1892, to the University of 
Chicago, Merriam was invited to take the chair of, economics at Nashville, but he 
determined to finish his course of graduate study. He held a fellowship in politi- 
cal economy at the Johns Hopkins University from 1892 to 1893. He was regarded 
by his friends and instructors as one of the most talented, critical, and promising 
students of economics at the Johns Hopkins University. 
While in Baltimore he prepared several scholarly papers for publication: (1) Social 
Legislation in the United States in 1889 and 1890 (Economic Review, April, 1891); 
(2) The Appointment of a Receiver for the City of Nashville in 1869 (American Law 
Review, May-June, 1891); (3) The Theory of Final Utility in its Relation to the 
Standard of Deferred Payments (Annals of the American Academy, January, 1893); 
(4) History of Higher Education in Tennessee (U. S. Bureau of Education, 1893). 
Of all these papers the present study is probably the most important. It will 
undoubtedly attract wide attention and prove of great practical value. It is critical 
and scholarly, like everything which Merriam wrote, and represents the earnest 
endeavor of an honest student to tell the truth regarding the educational history of 
Tennessee. There was no unfriendly feeling on Merriam’s part toward the higher 
educational institutions of his State. He was striving for the best interests of higher 
and secondary education in Tennessee, to which State he was twice invited to return 
as a professor of history and economics. He was held in the highest esteem at Van- 
derbilt University and at the University of Tennessee. He accepted an attractive 
call to teach his own special subjects at Cornell University, Ithaca, N. Y., where, 
in a few weeks, he won the confidence of the faculty and the admiration of his 
students. 
In an academic memorial of Merriam, published in the Johns Hopkins University 
Studies in January-February, 1894, President Schurman, of Cornell University, said 
of this young Tennesseean: ‘‘I got the impression of a man of earnest purpose, 
serious character, and transparent honesty.” Prof. J. W. Jenks, of Cornell, said: 
“J fully agree that in losing him we have lost one of the ablest and most promis- 
ing of the younger economists of the country.” Dr, Sidney Sherwood, one of Mer- 
riam’s instructor’s at the Johns Hopkins University, said: ‘‘I believe he would have 
achieved much toward the establishment of the system of economic theury looked 
for by the next generation; a system that is based on economic life and not on 
metaphysics. His accomplished work, however small in amount, goes to confirm 
this belief.” Prof. John B. Clark, another of Merriam’s instructors in Baltimore, 
said: ‘“‘I can not even try to describe the charm that his personality had for me, 
15

16 HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE. 
* * * He made the impression of aman who was destined to be a leader of thought. 
Originality, analytical power, an accurate judgment, and moral earnestness were his 
characteristics. He would have entered unexplored fields of research.” 
Although Merriam’s life was suddenly cut short, he made a deep impression upon 
his friends and pupils in the North as well as at the South. He will be remembered 
by all who knew him as a young Tennesseean of noble charater, fine scholarship, and 
high aims. His devotion to truth for its own-sake was perhaps his most conspicu- 
-ous trait. 
The young woman who was drowned with Merriam in Cayuga Lake, at Ithaca, from 
the capsizing of a row boat, was also a rare type of humanity. She was a South 
‘Carolina girl from Laurens County, who had earned her own way from her father’s 
plantation through school and college at Columbia and into the law department of 
Cornell University. As a school teacher in her native State she had obtained the 
means of educating a younger sister. By public authority in South Carolina she 
had been engaged to prepare a report on the industrial education of women. Miss 
Yeargin, like Dr. Merriam, had finished her educational work, and their labors will 
doubtless enter into the educational life of the New South.

  CHAPTER I. 
GENERAL SURVEY OF HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNES- 
SEE. 
The history of higher education in Tennessee is in the main the his- 
tory of private initiative and activity. Practically all that has been 
done by Government for colleges and universities has been done by the 
United States and not by Tennessee herself.! The State has, however, 
acted as agent of the Federal Government whenever it has extended 
aid to institutions of learning within her borders. 
In 1806, conformably to the spirit in which North Carolina had ceded 
and the United States had accepted the territory afterwards known as 
Tennessee, Congress appropriated 100,000 acres of public land in Ten- 
nessee to two colleges, one to be established in the eastern, the other 
in the western part of the State. The same act also appropriated 
200,000 acres of land for academies and schools of a lower grade. East 
Tennessee College, at Knoxville, chartered for the purpose and united. 
with Blount College, and Cumberland College, at Nashville, chartered 
on the foundation of Davidson Academy, secured the grants for colleges. 
But, the State being made the administrator and trustee, these insti- 
tutions realized little from the bounty of Congress, and that little only 
after the lapse of many years. In the case of the Federal subsidy te 
found West Tennessee College the State seems to have transmitted 
promptly the proceeds of land sales. 
The name of the University of Tennessee (Hast Tennessee College 
became East Tennessee University in 1840 and the University of Ten- 
nessee in 1879) would imply that it was a State institution supported 
by the State. It makes biennial reports to the State superintendent 
of public instruction, and it is correlated with the public school system. 
It is a fact not generally known that in 1822 Cumberland College and 
East Tennessee College came into possession of 60,000 acres of land 
through the generosity of the State in relinquishing, for twenty-eight 
years her right to tax other thousands of acres belonging to the Uni- 
versity of North Carolina. 
Exercising the discretion conferred by the constitution (1870) to 
exempt from taxation such real, personal, or mixed property “as may 
be held and used for purposes purely religious, charitable, scientific, 
literary, or educational,” the legislature has exempted “ali property 
belonging to any religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educa- 
tional institution and actually used for the purposes for which said 
institution was created” and “all property belonging to publieschools, 
colleges, academies, and other seminaries of learning.” ? 
1The State has given considerable assistance to normal education.

18 HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE. 
The Peabody Normal College is unique in being, so to speak, the 
resultant of three forces. It rests on the foundation of the old Uni- 
versity of Nashville, enjoying the use of its plant and endowment; and 
it is further supported and fostered by the State of Tennessee and by 
the Peabody education fund. That it bids fair to fall heir to that im- 
mense fund lends an added interest to the already interesting history of 
the University of Nashville. For a quarter of a century this institution 
was raised by Philip Lindsley to a position of paramount influence in 
Tennesseesand the Southwest. Free from the domination of any reli- 
gious sect and situated in the capital city of the State, at the center 
of her civil and political life, the University of Nashville stood for 
Tennessee in her entirety as perhaps no other college has ever done. 
\ Whence have come the funds for the maintenance of colleges and 
universities? The answer is, chiefly from private purses through the 
yarious Christian denominations. The University of Tennessee, West 
Tennessee College, and the University of Nashville are the only prom- 
inent colleges in the history of the State that are not denominational. 
The Baptists have their Carson and Newman College and their South- 
western Baptist University; the Northern Methodists their U. S. Grant 
University; the Southern Methodists their Hiwassee College and their 
Vanderbilt University; the Cumberland Presbyterians their Bethel 
College and their Cumberland University; the Northern Presbyterians 
their Greeneville and Tusculum College, their Maryville College, and 
their Washington College; the Southern Presbyterians their King 
College and their Southwestern Presbyterian University; the Episco- 
palians their University of the South; the Roman Catholics their 
Ohristian Brothers’ College, etc. The largest of these church schools 
are not the result merely of local effort, but of the combined efforts of 
their respective churches in several States or parts of several States. 
Probably a moiety at least of the wealth invested in Tennessee colleges 
has come from other States. In this regard Tennessee may be called 
fortunate. The most largely endowed institution in the State, Vander- 
bilt University, is a notable illustration of this, Established or sup- 
ported by conferences of the Methodist Episcopal Church South, rep- 
resenting the States of Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, 
and Kentucky, its magnificent foundation was the gift of two citizens 
of the State of New York. 
The negro colleges—Fisk University, Roger Williams University, 
Central Tennessee College, and Knoxville College—were all established 
by Northern churches at the close of the civil war. They form a most 
interesting chapter in the history of Tennessee education. The strug- 
gles and self-sacrifice of their founders and their ultimate success are 
colored with somewhat of heroism and romance. The negro can not 
hold in too high honor these pioneers in the Christianization and edu- 
cationofhisrace. Fisk University, the highest grade purely collegiate 
institution for negroes in the world, was established by the American 
Missionary Association of the Congregational Church; Knoxville Col-

lege, which has been made the colored department of the University of 
Tennessee, was founded by the United Presbyterian Church; Roger 
Williams University owes its creation to the American Baptist Home 
Mission Society, and Central Tennessee College, with its professional 
departments and its splendid industrial plant, is the work of the Freed- 
men’s Aid Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Besides these 
higher institutions of learning for negroes there are a number of nor- 
mal and industrial schools of a lower grade which do not fall within 
the scope of this monograph. The industrial feature is prominent in 
all the negro schools. The majority of them receive from the John F. 
Slater fund appropriations in aid of industrial training.- 
In spite of these adverse conditions the avowedly preparatory school 
is making headway in Tennessee. The famous Webb school, formerly 
at Culleoka, now at Bellbuckle, is the forerunner of others that may 
ere long boast of equal excellence. In December, 1887, the association 
of Tennessee colleges and universities was organized, its chief object 
being to arrive at and maintain a common standard of admission to 
college. The heads of preparatory schools attend the meetings and join 
in the deliberations. 
Closely connected with the existence of the pseudo college is the evil 
of indiscriminate conferring of degrees. But the pseudo college is not 
the only offender. The better class of institutions are some of them so 
generous with their degrees, at least with their honorary degrees, that 
academic honors have become a cheap commodity in Tennessee.! 
The smaller colleges of the State are almost always open to females 
as well as males; and of the larger ones, the Peabody Normal College, 
the U. S. Grant University, and the Southwestern Baptist University 
admit women.? But coeducation is not an accepted policy in Tennessee. 
Of the institutions treated in this monograph the following are coedu- 
cational: U. 8. Grant University, Southwestern Baptist University, 
Peabody Normal College, Bethel College, Carson and Newman College, 
Winchester Normal, Greeneville and Tusculum College, Maryville Col- 
lege, Milligan College, Lookout Mountain Educational Institution (dis- 
continued), Washington College, and all the colleges for negroes. 
The war period forms an interregnum; it makes a break in the his- 
tory of Tennessee education. So bold is the landmark that it might 
well be used toreckon time from. There was scarcely a college but had 
to close its doors, some never to open them again. Sometimes every- 
thing was swept away; and again only the bare walls were left. The 
schools that escaped unscathed were few. But what made it especially 
difficult for the colleges to regain their footing, if indeed they were 
able to regain it at all, was that the people and the country had suf- 
fered as much as themselves. The sources had dried up.

  CHAPTER II. 
THE UNIVERSITY OF NASHVILLE. 
DAVIDSON ACADEMY. 
Two names are inseparably associated with the founding and early 
history of Davidson Academy—James Robertson and Thomas B. Craig- 
head. Both were North Carolinians by birth and Scotch-Irish by 
descent. Robertson was a pioneer. As soon as the Watauga settle- 
ments were firmly established and their future existence assured, he 
left them in order to lead still further westward the advance guard of 
civilization. The stations on the Cumberland became the second great 
center of colonization for Tennessee as those on the Watauga were the 
first. ‘Thomas B. Craighead was the son of Rev. Alexander Craig- 
head, the man who first, in 1749, gave voice in Pennsylvania to the 
growing desire for independence, incurred the hostility of His Majesty’s 
magistrates and the censures of the synod, and, emigrating to North 
Carolina, instilled the principles which bore fruit in the [now dis- 
eredited] Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence.” Young Craig- 
head graduated from Princeton in 1775, in the same class with Dr. 
Brevard, the reputed author of the Mecklenburg declaration. Knowing 
the atmosphere which Craighead breathed in his youth, we need not be 
surprised that in after life he showed the same independence of charac- 
ter that marked his father and his classmate. 
Craighead was ordained a Presbyterian minister in 1780, and after 
preaching awhile in his native State ‘removed with the pioneers of 
those days to Kentucky.” Early in 1785 he came to Nashville and 
soon took up his permanent residence at Spring Hill, in the suburbs of 
the little town of Haysboro, 6 miles east of Nashville, on the road lead_ 
ing to Gallatin. Here was built for him the Spring Hill meeting house, 
a rough stone structure about 24 by 30 feet. 
On December 29, 1785, Gen. James Robertson, who, with Col. Wil- 
liam Polk, represented Davidson County in the North Carolina legisla- 
ture, secured the passage of a bill for the establishment of Davidson 
Academy. Its trustees were Rey. Thomas B. Craighead, Hugh Wil- 
liamson, Daniel Smith, William Polk, Anthony Bledsoe, Lardner Clarke, 
Ephraim McLean, Robert Hays, and James Robertson; and it was 
enacted “that no lands, tenements, or hereditaments which” might 
“be vested in the trustees of the Academy of Davidson, forthe sole use 
20

and behoof of the said academy,” should “be subject to any tax for the 
space of ninety-nine years.” North Carolina still farther showed her 
generosity by endowing her new creation with 240 acres of land imme- 
diately adjoining the town of Nashville on the south. One of the first 
actions taken by the trustees was to order two of their number to 
attend, in conjunction with the town authorities, to surveying this land 
and separating it from the town lands. 
The most significant part of the act creating Davidson Academy is 
that part of the preamble which reads, “As it is the indispensable duty 
of every legislature to consult the happiness of a rising generation and 
fit them for an honorable discharge of the social duties of life.” These 
first settlers recognized the importance of education to their children 
and-their children’s children. They seemed to realize that they were 
building for the future. The fact that the most prominent men in the 
community were corporators and trustees of Davidson Academy is 
proof that it held a large place in the popular mind. Pride in it was 
part of the local patriotism. It represented no religious sect and no 
political party. When political feeling was running high in the time. 
of the Alien and Sedition Laws and the Kentucky and Virginia Resolu- 
tions, a rival institution, the “Federal Seminary,” sprang up. Buta 
reconciliation was effected, the new school was merged in the old, and 
political enemies were soon pulling together like “ wheel horses.” 
At the first meeting of the trustees, August 19, 1786, Rev. Thomas 
B. Craighead was elected president. In the minutes of September 25 
we read: “Ordered that the tuition for each student be at the rate of 
£4 per annum to be paid in hard money or other money of that value.” 
(The tuition was soon afterwards raised to £5.) “Ordered that Spring 
Hill meeting house be the place where the school be taught.” Here, ac- 
cordingly, for twenty years or more Mr. Craighead taught. If he had 
any assistants the records do not show it. ‘Thatold stone church was 
a monument of early date—the oldest church and schoolhouse in mid- 
dle Tennessee. It was the house of worship and education—the cradle of 
Nashville University. The children were taughtinit during the week; 
the parents, children, and servants on the Lord’s day. Mr. Craighead 
was the patron of learning, the teacher of youth, the counsellor and in- 
structor of the aged.” The Spring Hill meeting house is no longer 
standing. It was torn down many years ago and the Gallatin turnpike 
runs through its site. The remains of Mr. Craighead lie in the old 
churchyard near by. 
The trustees of the academy administered its affairs with scrupulous 
care, even to the minutest details. Therecords of their meetings afford 
quaint and interesting reading. A ferry, established as early as 1786 
just above what is now Broad street, was the source of some income 
and of much annoyance, until it was sold in 1813. When Davidson 
Academy had expanded into a college and felt the need of a large 
income, it was charged that its patrimony of 240 acres of land had   
 
-P-A-G-E-24

been frittered away or sold fora song. Of course, had the land been 
kept out of the market for a number of years, it would have brought a 
high price. But at that time Nashville had a very small population, 
only 400 in 1803, and there was no premonition of its becoming the 
capital and chief city of the State. Besides, the trustees had in some 
way to obtain funds to pay the expenses of the school. The academy 
lands were rented or leased and some of them sold for small sums until 
1803, when all but 7 acres were sold in small lots at auction. It was at 
this time that Broad street was laid off and given to the city. On the 
7 acres reserved from sale the college buildings were afterwards erected. 
Tt has been estimated that the institution received all told in rents and 
purchase money about $20,000 for its first endowment of land. Part 
of this sum was used in constructing buildings in 1805-1808, 
October 10,1791, Andrew Jackson was elected a trustee to fill the 
vacancy caused by the removal of Col. William Polk to what is now 
Maury County. Both Andrew Jackson and James Robertson resigned 
in 1805. We find the origin of the library in an entry of March 4, 
1794, that a committee was appointed to collect debts and purchase 
books for the use of the academy. 
On April 5, £796, the Territorial legislature passed an act appoint- 
ing three auditors and ten new trustees in place of the old trustees, 
If the old board should refuse to account to the auditors, suits were to 
be instituted againstit. We do not know the reason for this summary 
and high-handed treatment, but we do know that the old trustees 
refused to vacate their places and that two years after the passage of 
the act they appointed Craighead and Jackson a committee to draft a 
memorial to the legislature for the repeal of the act. 
There was one part of the act, however, with which the board of 
trustees had already resolved to comply. It was the last section and 
ran in these words: 
Be it enacied, That the buildings of the said academy shall be erected on the most 
convenient situation on the hill immediately above Nashville and near to the road 
leading to Buchanan’s Mill; and that the trustees aforesaid shall proceed to erect 
buildings and employ tutors to proceed to the business of instruction as soon as the 
funds will permit. 
In 1786 Sumner County had been created out of a part of Davidson 
County. It is an evidence of the pride and interest taken in the acad- 
emy that in 1802 the inhabitants of Sumner set up a claim to it. The 
matter was decided by subscriptions. Nashville’s citizens responded 
more liberally than did those of Montpelier, the rival town in Sum- 
ner, and the academy was not moved. The trustees thereupon resolved 
to erect a building agreeably to the act of 1796, and Gen. Robertson 
and Gen. Jackson were appointed to superintend the construction. 
But, delays occurring, work did not begin till 1805, and was not finished 
till 1808, when Davidson Academy had become Cumberland College. 
The structure was of brick, and when finally completed was three

stories high and 70 feet long by 404 feet wide. It cost $12,240. We 
now come to a new period in the history of Nashville University. 
CUMBERLAND COLLEGE. 
The legislature of Tennessee passed an act in 1803 converting David- 
son Academy into Davidson College. At a meeting of trustees, Janu- 
_ary 19, 1804, it was decided unanimously, “after mature deliberation, 
and taking the opinion of counsel learned in the law,” not to accept 
this change in their charter. Craighead and Smith were appointed a 
committee to memorialize the legislature, “setting forth the ill effects 
of their late law and its illegality, as the trustees were advised.” But 
something soon occurred that made the trustees as desirous to become 
a college as they had been before to remain an academy. 
In ceding to the United States the territory which subsequently be- 
came the State of Tennessee North Carolina stipulated that the inhab- 
itants of said territory “should enjoy all the privileges, benefits, and 
advantages” guaranteed to the inhabitants of the Northwest Territory 
in the celebrated ordinance of 1787. One of these guaranties was: 
“Religion, morality, and knowledge being necessary to good govern- 
ment and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of educa- 
tion shall forever be encouraged.” In compliance with these conditions 
of cession Congress passed an act April 18, 1806, granting certain 
public lands to the State of Tennessee for educational purposes. These _ 
lands were to be located south of the French Broad and Holston Rivers 
and west of the Big Pigeon River—100,000 acres for the benefit of 
academies, one in each county in the State, and 100,000 acres for the 
benefit of two colleges, one-half to each, to be established in Hast and 
West Tennessee, respectively. Also “six hundred and forty acres were 
required to be located for every six square miles in the territory ceded 
to the State of Tennessee to be appropriated to the use of schools for 
the instruction of children forever.” When this act was passed there 
was no college in West Tennessee and the trustees of Davidson Acad- 
emy at once petitioned the legislature to convert their academy into a 
college. The petition was acceded to and on September 11, 1806, Cum- 
berland College was chartered on the foundation of Duvidson Acad- 
emy. A board of nineteen trustees was incorporated, in whom was 
vested the control of all the property of Davidson Academy, together 
with one moiety of the Congressional grant to colleges. We shall see 
in the course of this history how the expectations raised by the munifi- 
cence of the Federal Government were disappointed again and again. 
The Congressional grant had a lasting effect upon the history of the 
University of Nashville. Without the alluring prospect of govern- 
mental aid the trustees of Davidson Academy might have resisted, as 
they did the first one, all attempts to enlarge the scope and raise the 
standard of their school. With it they conceived hopes and projected 
plans that at last culminated in the University of Nashville.
-P-A-G-E-26
  24 HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE. 
Cumberland College opened its doors September 1, 1807. Thomas B. 
Craighead had been elected president in the preceding July. Heserved 
until October, 1809, when he resigned, and Dr. James Priestley was 
elected. He continued one of the board of trustees until 1813, at which 
time his connection with the institution ceased. For twenty-threeyears 
he was its head, and for twenty years its only teacher. Dr. Philip 
Lindsley’s favorite theory that the university is the source of educational 
impulse and activity certainly finds verification in the history of Ten- 
nessee. From the colleges and universities of the older States, chiefly 
Princeton, came the pioneers of education in Tennessee, Doak, Carrick, 
Balch, Craighead, and later Lindsley himself, from whom for a quarter 
of a century emanated an influence that was felt throughout the whole 
Southwest. Craighead’s independence of thought led him to differ from 
his church on some doctrinal point. He was suspended from the min- 
istry during the whole period from 1810 to 1822, though, as his father 
before him had done in similar circumstances, he preached occasionally. 
“Tt was not until 1824, the year in which he died, that he was wholly 
relieved from church censure and reinstated in the ministry.” Possi- 
bly he did something towards giving Cumberland College and Nash- 
ville University that nonsectarian stamp which Philip Lindsley after- 
wards so strongly impressed upon it. The legislature enacted in 1809 
that “no ordinance, rule, or by-laws shall ever be made or entered into 
so as to give a preference to any one denomination of Christians.” 
The administration of Dr. James Priestley began in January, 1810. 
The faculty was composed of himself and the Rey. William Hume as 
professors and of George Martin as tutor in the preparatory depart- 
ment. This constituted the teaching force until the suspension of col- 
lege exercises in 1816. Lack of means caused the suspension. In 
order to ascertain the character of the instruction given by Hume and 
Priestley we have only to turn to the list of their graduates. It con- 
tains such names as those of John Bell and Ephraim H. Foster, United 
States Senators, and Constantine Perkins, George W. Owen, and 
Edward D. White, members of the lower House of Congress. The 
first degrees conferred were in 1813, and the-whole number of grad- 
uates until the suspension of the college in 1816 was 19. William 
Hume is an interesting figure in the history of those early times. 
Born in Scotland and educated at the University of Ndinburgh, he 
came to this country in 1801 as a missionary of the Secession Presby- 
terian Church. He first went to Kentucky, but soon after settled in 
Nashville. Here helived as preacher and teacher till his death in 1833. 
From 1808 to 1816 he was professor of languages in Cumberland Col- 
lege. After the close of the college in the latter year he taught a 
grammar school in the college building—just how long is not known. 
In 1820 he became principal of Nashville Female Academy and filled 
the position until his death. His connection with Cumberland College 
and Nashville University never wholly ceased. After its resuscitation
-P-A-G-E-27
THE UNIVERSITY OF NASHVILLE. 25 
in 1822 he was elected a trustee and remained on the board during the 
rest of his life. 
Dr. Hume was a scholarly man and an able teacher. But it was as 
“the good man of Nashville” that he was most widely known. Hehad 
more than the common siare of gentleness and amiability. His native 
kindness of heart and noble self-denial won for him the unalloyed 
respect and. love of the whole community. On the stone above his 
grave are written the words: “In testimony of their affectionate grati- 
tude and profound respect the citizens of Nashville have erected this 
simple monument, under the deep conviction that the memory of his 
virtues and active goodness will be cherished long after this sepulchral 
tablet will be obliterated and forgotten.” His son, Alfred Hume, en- 
joyed perhaps a higher reputation as a teacher than his father. When 
Nashville decided in 1852 to establish public schools, he was appointed. 
to visit other cities and examine their systems. He did so, and his 
report thereon was accepted and made the basis of the present public 
school system of Nashville. The Hume School was so named in his 
honor. The scholarly tastes of old William Hume are perpetuated in 
his descendants. A great grandson is professor of mathematics in one 
of our Southern State universities. 
In November, 1819, Mr. M. Stevens opened a grammar school in the 
college building. Two years later he moved into a building of his own. 
Aid now, after a lapse of six years, Cumberland College resumed opera- 
tions with its former president, Dr. James Priestley, at its head. But 
Dr. Priestley’s death, on the 6th of February, 1821, again thwarted the 
plans of the trustees. Nevertheless, instruction in the lower branches 
continued to be given. 
We have now come to the brightest period in the annals of the Uni- 
versity of Nashville—the period of Philip Lindsley’s administration. 
For the next twenty-five years this educator, whose own fame was not 
confined to a section, gave to the University of Nashville a national 
reputation. The trustees seem to have waked from their lethargy and 
for the first time, perhaps, to have realized the importance of their trust. 
The ever-present hope of succor from the sale of the East Tennessee 
lands granted by Congress was a powerful incentive in this new move- 
ment. A petition for help was sent broadcast through the State, and 
agents were appointed in every county to receive subscriptions. They 
were so far successful that the trustees of the college were enabled to 
enlarge the main building and to erect new ones. In 1822 and again in 
1823 Dr. Lindsley was called to the presidency of the college, but in 
both instances he refused to accept. The board of trustees called him 
again May 12, 1824, and this time, after first visiting Nashville, he con- 
sented to come. 
PHILIP LINDSLEY. 
“ Philip Lindsley was born December 21, 1786, near Morristown, N. 
J. His parents were both of English extraction, the Lindsleys and

Condicts being among the earliest settlers of Morristown and influential 
Whigs of the Revolution. His early youth was spent in his father’s 
family at Basking Ridge, N. J., and in his thirteenth year he entered. 
the academy of the Rev. Robert Finley of that place, with whom he 
continued nearly three years. He entered the junior class of the Col- 
lege of New Jersey in November, 1802, and was graduated in Septem- 
ber, 1804. After graduating he became an assistant teacher, first in 
Mr. Steven’s school, at Morristown, and then in Mr. Finley’s, at Bask- 
ing Ridge. He resigned his place with the latter in 1807, and about 
the same time became a member of Mr. Finiey’s church and a candidate 
for the ministry under the care of the Presbytery. He was then for 
two years Latin and Greek tutor in the college at Princeton, where he 
devoted himself to the study of theology, chiefly under the direction of 
its president, Dr. Samuel Stanhope Smith. On the 24th of April, 1810,' 
he was licensed to preach the gospel by the Presbytery of New Bruns- 
wick. 
“Continuing his theological studies during the next two years, and 
also preaching awhile at Newton, Long Island, where he declined over- 
tures for a settlement, he made an excursion into Virginia, and after- 
ward to New England, and in November, 1812, returned to Princeton 
in the capacity of senior tutor in the college. In 1813 he was trans- 
ferred from the tutorship to the professorship of languages, and at the 
same time was chosen secretary of the board of trustees. He also held 
the office of librarian and inspector of the college during his connection 
with the institution. In October of this year he was married to Mar- 
garet Elizabeth, daughter of the Hon. Nathaniel Lawrence, attorney- 
general of the State of New York. 
“Tn 1817 he was twice chosen president of Transylvania University, 
Kentucky, but in both instances declined. In the same year he was 
ordained, sine titulo, by the Presbytery of New Brunswick, and was also 
elected vice-president of the College of New Jersey. In 1822, after Dr. 
Green’s resignation, he was for one year its acting president.” Dr. 
Lindsley was now sought for to fill the presidencies of various colleges. 
During the course of his lifetime he received calls from Ohio Univer- 
sity, Transylvania University, University of Alabama, College of Louis- 
jana, Dickinson College, University of Pennsylvania, and others. But 
doubtless the hardest to reject was the call in 1823 to the presidency of 
Princeton. It required no little forceof will and steadfastness of purpose 
to turn his back on his alma mater, the college with which he had so 
long been connected and which was, moreover, one of the three great- 
est institutions of learning in the United States, in order to go toa 
small college in the Southwest, not known beyond the limits of the State 
in which it was situated. He would not have come “but for the assur- 
ance given that Uumberland College had a foundation of at least 
$100,000, the donation of the mother State through the national Con- 
gress and guaranteed by the general assembly of the State of Tennes-

istry during the whole period from 1810'to 1822, though, as his father 
before him had done in similar cireumstances, he preached occasionally. 
“Tt was not until 1824, the year in which he died, that he was wholly 
relieved from church censure and reinstated in the ministry.” Possi- 
bly he did something towards giving Cumberland College and Nash- 
ville University that nonsectarian stamp which Philip Lindsley after- 
wards so strongly impressed upon it. The legislature enacted in 1809 
that “no ordinance, rule, or by-laws shall ever be made or entered into 
so as to give a preference to any one denomination of Christians.” 
The administration of Dr. James Priestley began in January, 1810. 
The faculty was composed of himself and the Rev. William Hume as 
professors and of George Martin as tutor in the preparatory depart- 
ment. This constituted tke teaching force until the suspension of col- 
lege exercises in 1816. Lack of means caused the suspension. In 
order to ascertain the character of the instruction given by Hume and 
Priestley we have only to turn to the list of their graduates. It con- 
tains such names as those of John Bell and Ephraim H. Foster, United 
States Senators, and Constantine Perkins, George W. Owen, and 
Edward D. White, members of the lower House of Congress. The 
first degrees conferred were in 1813, and the whole number of grad- 
uates until the suspension of the college in 1816 was 19. William 
Hume is an interesting figure in the history of those early times. 
Born in Scotland and educated at the University of Edinburgh, he 
came to this country in 1801 as a missionary of the Secession Presby- 
terian Church. He first went to Kentucky, but soon after settled in 
Nashville. Here he lived as preacher and teacher till his death in 1833. 
From 1808 to 1816 he was professor of languages in Cumberland Col- 
lege. After the close of the college in the latter year he taught a 
grammar school in the college building—just how long is not known. 
In 1820 he became principal of Nashville Female Academy and filled 
the position until his death. His connection with Cumberland College 
and Nashville University never wholly ceased. After its resuscitation

in 1822 he was elected a trustee and remained on the board during the 
rest of his life. 
Dr. Hume was a scholarly man and an able teacher. But it was as 
“the good man of Nashville” that he was most widely known. Hehad 
more than the common share of gentleness and amiability. His native 
kindness of heart and noble self-denial won for him the unalloyed 
respect and love of the whole community. On the stone above his 
grave are written the words: “In testimony of their affectionate grati- 
tude and profound respect the citizens of Nashville have erected this 
simple monument, under the deep conviction that the memory of his 
virtues and active goodness will be cherished long after this sepulchral 
tablet will be obliterated and forgotten.” His son, Alfred Hume, en- 
joyed perhaps a higher reputation as a teacher than his father. When 
Nashville decided in 1852 to establish public schools, he was appointed 
to visit other cities and examine their systems. He did so, and his 
report thereon was accepted and made the basis of the present public 
school system of Nashville. The Hume School was so named in his 
honor. The scholarly tastes of old William Hume are perpetuated in 
his descendants. A great grandson is professor of mathematics in one 
of our Southern State universities. 
In November, 1819, Mr. M. Stevens opened a grammar school in the 
college building. Two years later he moved into a building of his own. 
And now, after a lapse of six years, Cumberland College resumed opera- 
tions with its former president, Dr. James Priestley, at its head. But 
Dr. Priestley’s death, on the 6th of February, 1821, again thwarted the 
plans of the trustees. Nevertheless, instruction in the lower branches 
continued to be given. 
We have now come to the brightest period in the annals of the Uni- 
versity of Nashville—the period of Philip Lindsley’s administration. 
For the next twenty-five yéars this educator, whose own fame was not | 
confined to a section, gave to the University of Nashville a national 
reputation. The trustees seem to have waked from their lethargy and 
for the first time, perhaps, to have realized the importance of their trust. 
The ever-present hope of succor from the sale of the Hast Tennessee 
lands granted by Congress was a powerful incentive in this new move- 
ment, A petition for help was sent broadcast through the State, and 
agents were appointed in every county to receive subscriptions. They 
were so far successful that the trustees of the college were enabled to 
enlarge the main building and toerect new ones. In 1822 and again in 
1823 Dr. Lindsley was called to the presidency of the college, but in 
both instances he refused to accept. The board of trustees called him 
again May 12, 1824, and this time, after first visiting Nashville, he con- 
sented to come. 
PHILIP LINDSLEY. 
“Philip Lindsley was born December 21, 1786, near Morristown, N. 
J. His parents were both of English extraction, the Lindsleys and
-P-A-G-E-32
26 HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE. 
Condicts being among the earliest settlers of Morristown and influential 
Whigs of the Revolution. His early youth was spent in his father’s 
family at Basking Ridge, N. J., and in his thirteenth year he entered 
the academy of the Rev. Robert Finley of that place, with whom he 
continued nearly three years.. He entered the junior class of the Ool- 
lege of New Jersey in November, 1802, and was graduated in Septem- 
ber, 1804, After graduating he became an assistant teacher, first in 
Mr. Steven’s school, at Morristown, and then in Mr. Finley’s, at Bask- 
ing Ridge. He resigned his place with the latter in 1807, and about 
the same time became a member of Mr. Finley’s church and a candidate 
for the ministry under the care of the Presbytery. He was then for 
two years Latin and Greek tutor in the college at Princeton, where he 
devoted himself to the study of theology, chiefly under the direction of 
its president, Dr. Samuel Stanhope Smith. On the 24th of April, 1810, 
he was licensed to preach the gospel by the Presbytery of New Bruns- 
wick, ~ 
“Continuing his theological studies during the next two years, and 
also preaching awhile at Newton, Long Island, where he declined over- 
tures for a settlement, he made an excursion into Virginia, and after- 
ward to New England, and in November, 1812, returned to Princeton 
in the capacity of senior tutor in the college. In 1813 he was trans- 
ferred from the tutorship to the professorship of languages, and at the 
same time was chosen secretary of the board of trustees. He also held 
the office of librarian and inspector of the college during his connection 
with the institution. In October of this year he was married to Mar- 
garet Elizabeth, daughter of the Hon. Nathaniel Lawrence, attorney- 
general of the State of New York. 
“Jn 1817 he was twice chosen president of Transylvania University, 
Kentucky, but in both instances declined. In the same year he was 
ordained, sine titulo, by the Presbytery of New Brunswick, and was also 
elected vice-president of the College of New Jersey. In 1822, after Dr. 
Green’s resignation, he was for one year its acting president.” Dr. 
Lindsley was now sought for to fill the presidencies of various colleges. 
During the course of his lifetime he received calls from Ohio Univer- 
sity, Transylvania University, University of Alabama, College of Louis- 
jana, Dickinson College, University of Pennsylvania, and others. But 
doubtless the hardest to reject was the call in 1823 to the presidency of 
Princeton. It required no little force of will and steadfastness of purpose 
to turn his back on his alma mater, the college with which he had so 
long been connected and which was, moreover, one of the three great- 
est institutions of learning in the United States, in order to go to a 
smnall college in the Southwest, not known beyond the limits of the State 
in which it was situated. He would not have come “but for the assur- 
ance given that Cumberland College had a foundation of at least 
$100,600, the donation of the mother State through the national Con- 
gress and guaranteed by the general assembly of the State of Tennes-
-P-A-G-E-33

see.” His purpose was to build up a great university that should be to 
the South and West what° Harvard, Yale, and Princeton were to the 
North and Hast. That he partially failed was no fault of his. His 
plans were large, his conceptions were noble, and he did his part to 
realize them. He had believed that State and people would rally 
round their own university and that patriotic pride would not suffer it 
to fall below any in the land. He says in his baccalaureate address of 
October 7, 1829: “I did once flatter myself that the people of Tennessee 
would rally round this infant seat of science and take a just pride in 
its growth and prosperity. I did suppuse that they would cherish an 
institution of their own, established in their own flourishing metropo- 
lis,” etc. - 
In his inaugural address, delivered January 12, 1825, he projects his 
plan of a university: ‘“‘ We hope to see the day, or that our successors 
will see it, when in Cumberland College, or in the University of Nash- 
ville,! shall be found such an array of able professors, such libraries 
and apparatus, such cabinets of curiosities and of natural history, such 
botanical gardens, astronomical observatories; and chemical Jaborato- 
ries as shall secure to the student every advantage which the oldest 
and noblest Huropean institution can boast, so that no branch of exper- 
imental or physical, of moral or political science, or of ancient and 
modern language and literature shall be neglected. Let us aim at per- 
fection, however slowly we may advance towards the goal of our wishes.” 
Again and again did he picture to his hearers his ideal university and 
present it to them as the noblest object their ambition could have. 
When there was no longer hope of State aid or of private munificence, 
he turned to the young men whom he had trained as the future main- 
stay of the university: “Where, then, is the ground of our hopes and 
of our encouragement? It is in the growing strength and moral influ. — 
ence of our own enlightened, loyal, and patriotic sons. * * * Itis 
in them, under the propitious smiles and overruling Providence of the 
Most High, that we place our confidence and garner up our soul’s fond- 
est aspirations. * * * Wesay, or rather let the university proudly 
say, ‘These are our sons. We send them forth into the world, and by 
the world’s spontaneous verdict upon their training and their bearing 
will we abide”” Ashe proceeds his faith grows triumphant. ‘ Our 
faith is strong, unwavering, invincible; and our purpose to persevere 
in the good work which has thus far been signally prospered in the 
midst of every species of hindrance and discouragement, can not be 
shaken. The tongue which now speaks our high resolve and bids defi- 
ance to serutiny, to prejudice, to jealousy, to cowardice, to calumny, to 
malevolence may be silent in the tomb long ere the glorious victory 
shall be achieved. But we, the university, live forever, and generations 
yet unborn shall rejoice in our triumphs and pronounce the eulogium 
which our labors will have nobly won.” His confidence in his pupils

-P-A-G-E-34
28 HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE. 
was not misplaced. No college can show a list of alumni who have 
taken higher rank in public and in private life. Says Phelan: “It 
was remarked that at one time there were twenty-eight members of the 
United States House of Representatives who had graduated at that 
institution.” The loyalty of the alumni does not grow less with the 
flight of years. A stranger in Nashville, if he mingles with the older 
inhabitants, will soon hear of the ‘Old University.” Philip Lindsley 
still lives in the minds and hearts of his pupils. The dignified, the 
classic Lindsley was loved as well as respected. Judge John D. Phelan, 
when a gray-haired old man, thus recalls an interview he had with him, 
apropos of some college prank and its punishment: “With many other 
kind words and in the most tender and fatherly manner he dismissed 
me. Oh, the healing balm of that sweet interview. Isee him now. I 
love him and I live in the blessed faith that I am yet to see him again, 
face to face, with other loved ones that are now only lost to mortal 
sight. 
fi ‘My Father’s house on high, 
Home of my soul, how near. 
At times by Faith’s aspiring eye 
Thy golden gates appear.’” 
Again, Judge Phelan says: ‘This man was worshiped, adored by our 
fellows, at least by all the more thoughtful.” His teaching was inspiring, 
ennobling. He was wont to lead young men to some lofty height and 
point them to the life of the spirit beyond. Says an old pupil: “He 
possessed, beyond most men, incomparably beyond all men ever known 
to your speaker, that highest faculty of the teacher—the power to inspire 
the youthful mind with a just appreciation of truth, of the purposes 
and ends of life. May his declining years be as full of bright prospects 
beyond as he has made many a young life full of generous ambition and 
of an almost romantic love of the beautiful and true.” 
It was chiefly through his baccalaureate addresses that Dr. Lindsley 
reached and influenced the world that lay without the college walls. 
These addresses were delivered to large audiences, and then printed in 
pamphlet form and distributed through the mails. He was in touch 
with the times, and this was one secret of his success as a speaker. 
He was accorded that respect by the public which a man should always 
receive whom wide learning and extended observation have specially 
adapted to form wise judgments. He spoke with great earnestness, 
was @ man of strong convictions, and did not hesitate to express them. 
His style was clear, forceful, cumulative. He had a copious vocabulary 
and a discriminating command of synonyms that obviated the harsh- 
ness of repetition. A dignified bearing lent weight to his words. 
“His personal appearance was exceedingly fine. It might be called 
commanding, though he was slender and not above the medium stature, 
His form was perfectly erect and symmetrical. His features were chis- 
eled after the finest Grecian mold. He had full black hair and a spa-
-P-A-G-E-35
    
THE UNIVERSITY OF NASHVILLE, 29 
cious forehead of almost marble smoothness. His dark, penetrating 
eye flashed with indescribable emotion as he spoke, while his whole 
frame seemed to dilate and rise with majesty. His voice was rich and 
musical alike in its highest and in its lowest notes, and there was a 
peculiar play of expression about the mouth indicative of decision and 
conscious mental power which no painter’s art could ever catch. All 
these outward gifts, aside from his rare intellectual gifts and attain- 
ments, contributed to make him attractive and eloquent.” 
His addresses were almost invariably upon education. Even his 
sermons bore uponit. He never tired of it. He had given his life to 
it and it filled his life. But the term as used by him had no narrow 
signification. The difference between the new-born babe and the full- 
grown man is merely one of education. Education is almost synony- 
mous with acquisition. It comprises every step, every process in a 
man’s physical, intellectual, and moral development. No kind of 
knowledge is to be despised. Our minds are to be cultivated to the fur- 
thest extent. Ifit were not so God would not have created in us such 
vast possibilities. ‘ Educate your son in the best manner possible, 
because you expect him to be a man and not a horse or an ox.” As for 
himself he held that “learning was the birthright of man.” But /he had 
a whole storehouse of utilitarian arguments to use in converting the 
multitude to his views. To the demagogic plea of the enemies of the 
university in Tennessee, that colleges are for the exclusive benefit of 
the rich, he made the counter assertion, ‘“ Colleges are the genuine ley- 
elers of all distinctions created by mere wealth.” He saw that farmers 
and mechanics, forming, as they do, a majority of the electors, would 
be the governing power in the state if they were only more intelligent. 
Therefore none should welcome education more heartily than they. 
The plea for higher education that we find oftenest in Dr. Lindsley’s 
addresses is that intelligence is necessary to the preservation of the 
Republic. He never wearies of descanting upon the high intelligence 
of the founders of our Government; and he conceived that the only 
way to preserve the essence as well as the name of Republic was by a 
universal diffusion of knowledge, for ‘a republican government may 
be as unjust, as arbitrary, as oppressive, and despotic as any absolute 
monarchy upon the earth.” ‘A grossly ignorant people will be slaves 
even under the purest republican system.” “A well-instructed people 
ean ‘not be enslaved, be the nominal form of government whatit may.” 
In the same spirit Dr. Lindsley reviews the history of all civilized 
nations, ancient and modern, and reaches the conclusion that “ civil- 
ization and the university [meaning some system for the cultivation of 
the mind and the preservation of knowledge] have stood or fallen 
together. They have never been divorced. They were created together, 
and amidst all the changes and revolutions of human governments and 
religions they have dwelt together in peace and harmony.” The univer- 
sity has been “ the great conservative principle of civilization, of truth,  
-P-A-G-E-36
  
  30 HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE, 
virtue, learning, liberty, religion, and good government among man- 
kind.” ‘The university, or highest school, is the source whence ema- 
nate all the forces that make for intelligence. It is the central sun. 
Hence it is folly to attempt to keep alive a system of primary and 
grammar schools without it. The higher school is necessary to the 
existence of the lower, if for no other reason than to supply it with 
teachers. 
Dr. Lindsley thought that teaching would never attract the best 
talent until it was looked upon differently by the publie, until it was 
put ona par with other callings in respectability and remuneration. 
He contended boldly for the dignity of his profession and challenged 
any man to show in what regard it was not among the most respect- 
able and honorable. He never yielded one jot or tittle to other pro- 
fessions. He exalted and ennobled teaching and, in general, lent dig- 
nity to all intellectual pursuits. The effect of the noble stand taken 
by him was felt in the impulse given to education in Tennessee and 
other Southern States. So many schools sprang up as finally to cripple 
seriously the mother school, whence had spread this influence. 
Dr. Lindsley was an advocate of manual training. He would have 
attached to schools of all grades—grammar school, academy, college— 
farms and workshops. These farms and workshops would serve a 
threefold purpose: They would furnish needed exercise, they would 
be useful in teaching trades, and they would give poor boys an oppor- 
tunity of making a living. These ideas formed part of Dr. Lindsley’s 
plan for the University of Nashville, but they were never realized. 
We have seen that Davidson Academy and Cumberland College were 
nonsectarian and undenominational. So was their successor, the Uni- 
versity of Nashville. Dr. Lindsley said in 1837: “‘No attempt has ever 
been made to proselyte a single youth to any faith, political or relig- 
ious. We all profess to be Christians and republicans, and we fain 
would have our pupils to be honest Christians and consistent repub- 
licans. This is the utmost of our aim in all our labors, instructions, 
and exhortations so far as politics and religion are in question.” He 
had no patience whatever with church schools unless they openly 
avowed their sectarian character and aims. His denunciation of such 
schools is most vehement, sometimes transcending the bounds of perfect 
candor and justice. He did not see why colleges should be denomina- 
- tional any more than penitentiaries and banks. The secret of this atti- 
tude was no doubt his own broad Christian charity. The growth of 
denominational schools was a chief cause of the suspension of the Uni- 
versity of Nashville in 1850. When Dr, Lindsley assumed the presi- 
dency of Cumberland College in 1825 there were no similar institutions 
in actual operation within 200 miles of Nashville. In 1848 there were 
thirty or more within that distance and nine within 50 miles of the city, 
the majority of them being denominational schools. 
Philip Lindsley was a man of broad views. This is shown in the
-P-A-G-E-37
THE UNIVERSITY OF NASHVILLE. 31 i 
eatholicity of his sentiments and in the wide range of his learning. He 
viewed every subject in the perspective of extensive knowledge. And 
yet, though he has been dead only thirty-six years, it is patent to us of 
to-day that he lived in an age that is past, that he was without the 
light which is shed by the most recent research and discovery in history, 
archeology, and science. 
Cumberland College was reopened in November, 1824. On account 
of illness ‘in his family Dr. Lindsley did not arrive until December 24, 
He was inaugurated with great display January 12, 1825. His inaugural 
was the first of many addresses of a similar character delivered in the 
years that followed. 
We have aiready seen the plans projected and the ideals conceived 
in the brain of Dr. Lindsley. We have seen, too, some of the causes 
that prevented their full consummation. It was partly to be in har- 
mony with the larger scope and wider usefulness designed for Cum- 
berland College, partly to distinguish it from a college of the same name 
in Kentucky, that the 
UNIVERSITY OF NASHVILLE 
was chartered November 27, 1826, on the foundation of Cumberland 
College. In their petition to the general assembly the board of 
trustees prayed that Cumberland College might be changed to the 
“ University of Tennessee,” but such jealous opposition was shown that 
they substituted for the words “University of Tennessee” the words 
“University of Nashville.” The university received stronger support 
from the people of Nashville and Tennessee during the earlier than 
during the later years of Dr. Lindsley’s administration. It was not long 
before local and denominational jealousy and prejudice were aroused 
and the multiplication of petty colleges began to trench upon the 
patronage of Nashville University. 
The faculty at first was small, consisting of Dr. Lindsley, one pro- 
fessor, and two tutors. The professor was George W. McGehee; the 
tutors, George Martin and Nathaniel Cross. Dr. Lindsley taught 
belles-lettres and political, moral, and mental philosophy; Prof. Mce- 
Gehee taught mathematics and natural philosophy. The trustees 
when Dr. Lindsley took charge of affairs were: James Winchester, 
Robert C. Foster, sr., David McGavock, Nicholas T. Perkins, John 
MeNairy, Felix Grundy, Felix Robertson, Elihu S. Hail, Michael 
Campbell, Jesse Wharton, James Roane, Alfred Balch, Andrew Hays, 
Henry Crabb, William Hume, Ephraim H. Foster, Charles I. Love, 
John Bell, Francis B. Fogg, James Overton, Nathan Ewing, John 
Catron, William L. Brown, and Leonard P. Cheatham. To these 
should be added William Carroll, governor of Tennessee, and ea officio 
trustee of the university. To one familiar with the history of Tennes- 
see it is needless to dwell upon the famous names in this list, and 
some of them were known not to the State alone, but to the nation. 
 
-P-A-G-E-38

_ 82 _ HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE. 
Among those who became trustees while Lindsley was president were 
John M. Bass, Washington Barrow, Edwin H. Ewing, George W. 
Campbell, and Andrew Jackson. Jackson was elected in 1826 and 
remained on the board until his death, in 1845. Before his election to 
the Presidency of the United States he was tolerably regular in attend- 
ing meetings, and the minutes of the board record his presence two or 
three times after he became President, but no comment is made. In 
1824 the general assembly of Tennessee passed a law directing that 
there should be twenty-two trustees, and that vacancies should be 
filled by the board itself, but that its nominations should be subject to 
the approval of the assembly. The trustees accepted this as a part of 
their charter, but the assembly seems never to have availed itself of 
the privilege of rejecting their nominations. 
When the college resumed operations in the latter part of 1824 “there 
remained of the apparatus only a pair of small globes and a damaged 
air-pump.” ‘Of the old library there were on hand about 100 volumes.” 
But Dr. Lindsley brought from the East about 1,500 volumes obtained by 
gift or purchase, and $6,000 worth of apparatus were bought in Europe. 
In 1850 the number of volumes entered in the catalogues of the libraries 
of the university and of the two literary societies amounted to 10,207. 
The facilities for teaching the sciences became in time quite ample, 
including the mineralogical cabinet of Dr. Gerard Troost, which con- 
sisted of upwards of 20,000 specimens and was considered one of the 
finest in the United States. 
The number of students in attendance at any one time during this 
period, 1824 to 1850, ranged from 35 to 126, the latter number being 
reached in 1836, The total number of new students matriculated in 
the regular college classes from 1825 to 1849, inclusive, was 1,059. The 
total number of graduates between 1825 and 1850, inclusive, was 411. 
It is worthy of note how large a proportion of those who entered col- 
lege remained until they graduated. We see from these figures that 
the University of Nashville was never a large school under Dr. Linds- 
ley’s administration. In point of numbers it compared unfavorably 
with many Western and Southern colleges. But it must be remembered 
that these colleges had, most of them, their preparatory departments, 
and that their preparatory students were put down in their catalogues 
as college students. And to this it may be added that many students 
did not come to the university before they were prepared to enter the 
junior class.’ In 1828, and again in 1843, it was decided to create a 
preparatory department in the university, but it was never done. The 
policy was followed, however, of recognizing and approving preparatory 
schools of a high order. 
The degree of bachelor of arts was conferred on completion of the 
  
1A committee of the trustees, who prepared a sketch of the university in 1850, 
stated that usually two-thirds of the whole number of students were members of the 
junior and senior classes.

regular college course of four years. Upon application and the pay- 
ment of a fee, bachelors of three years’ standing were admitted to the 
degree of master of arts. After 1831 the payment of a fee was not 
required. This way of giving the master’s degree. is still in vogue in 
many reputable institutions. Another custom which is liable to much 
abuse was the bestowal of honorary degrees. From 1825 to 1850 sixty 
such degrees were conferred. 
There were two terms in the school year and two vacations of five 
and a half weeks each. The winter term ended the first Wednesday 
in April and the summer term the first Wednesday in October. The 
latter date was commencement day and the close of the school year. 
Public examinations lasting usually seven or eight days were held at 
the close of each term. 
The giving of prizes as rewards for scholarship was discarded. Dr. 
Lindsley thus testifies to the good results of the innovation: “A much 
larger proportion of every class become good scholars, and much greater 
peace, harmony, contentment, order, industry, and moral decorum pre- 
vail than it has been my lot to remark at seminaries east of the moun- 
tains.” 
The college buildings at this time were: (1) Cumberland Hall, the 
old college building enlarged. It was three stories high, had a length 
of 180 feet and an average width of 49 feet, and extended toward 
Market street on the east and Cherry street on the west. Besides the 
chapel, the halls of the two literary societies, and class rooms, it con- 
tained forty-four rooms for students. It was torn down in 1849-50 to 
make way for the extension of College street. (2) “The steward’s 
house and refectory, built in 1823, two stories high, 564 feet long by 42 
wide.” (3) “Laboratory, built in 1826, one story high, 90 feet long by 
374 feet wide.” (4) “President’s house, built in 1827-28, two stories 
high, front 543 feet by 434 feet rear; kitchen and offices extending back 
464 feet by 214, also two stories high.” (5) “Hast wing—so called as 
the first of a series of buildings then contemplated ”—fronted “on 
Market street 76 feet and towards the city 454 feet.” It was three 
stories high and contained “twelve dormitories, or studies, and six 
large rooms for library, apparatus, lectures, and recitations.” It was 
built in 1837-39. When the college site was changed in 1850 it sur- 
vived the general wreck, becoming the home of the newly created 
medical department, All these buildings were of brick; with stone 
foundations. 
Students who did not live at home, with relatives, or in private fami- 
lies designated by their parents or guardians, were required to room in 
the college buildings and to board with the steward. Expenses were 
less than at Eastern colleges. In 1825 the tuition fee was $50 per year; 
room rent, $4; library fee, $4; servants’ wages, $4; and general repairs, 
$2. The matriculation fee was $5, payable only by new students. 
Board with the steward cost about $2 per week. The student furnished

his room and paid for fuel and washing. The laws of the university 
forbade the keeping of carriages, dogs, or servants, and in general dis- 
couraged extravagance and unnecessary expenditure. A close super- 
vision was exercised over the life and habits of students. We find in 
the laws an evidence of the nonsectarian but strongly religious spirit 
that characterized the policy of the university. The instructors were 
admonished to avoid as far as possible all controverted points in Chris- 
tianity. At the same time any student who should avow or propagate 
principles subversive of morality or religion was declared liable to 
admonition, suspension, or expulsion. Poor boys studying for the 
ministry, whatever might be their denomination, were admitted to 
the university on the payment of half the regular fees. In 1849 the 
board of trustees ordered that any student unable to pay the fees should 
be admitted free of charge. 
The faculty was generally made up of the president, a professor of 
mathematics and natural philosophy, a professor of chemistry, miner- 
alogy, and geology, a professor of ancient languages, and one or two 
tutors. During four years of the period there was a professor of modern 
languages, and during three years a professor of French. Lack of funds 
would not permit the employment ef more teachers, and it prevented 
the payment of more liberal salaries to those who were employed: 
Sometimes, indeed, a professor was secured’ merely by giving him the 
right to exact fees from the students who took his course. Profs. James 
Hamilton, Nathaniel Cross, and Gerard Troost were members of the 
faculty for many years. They ranked high as scholars. Prof. Troost 
was a scientist well known on both sides of the Atlantic, being a mem- 
ber of many of the scientific and philosophic societies of Europe and 
America. Born a Hollander, he was educated in the schools of his native 
country—Leyden, Amsterdam, and others. He was a friend of Hum- 
boldt and Agassiz and translated into Dutch Humboldt’s Aspects of 
Nature. He led for many years a rather unsettled life, coming to Amer- 
ica in 1810 by accident, as it were. He was one of the organizers of 
the American Academy of Natural Sciences and for several years its 
president. In 1827 he came to Nashville, and in the following year was 
elected to the chair of chemistry, mineralogy, and geology in the Uni- 
versity of Nashville, which he filled until his death, twenty-two years 
later. The last official act of Dr. Lindsley was the delivery on com- 
mencement day, October 2, 1850, of a discourse upon the life and char- 
acter of his dead colleague, Gerard Troost. Prof. Troost was State 
geologist from 1831 to 1849. His salary was a paltry return for his 
services in laying bare the great mineral wealth of the State. This 
devotee of ascience then almost in its infancy was appreciated as little 
by his pupils as by the law-givers who assembled in the State capitol. 
But if his students could not appreciate his scientific attainments they 
could appreciate his gentleness of manner and his goodness of heart. 
One of them said years after: “If there ever was an unadulterated com-

pound of learning and goodness Dr. Troost was one.” Dr. ‘Troost’s 
scientific museum of several thousand specimens, containing some 
species discovered by himself, was purchased by the university and be- 
eame the property of the medical department. 
Several attempts to endow chairs in the university proved unsuccess- 
ful. The visit of La Fayette to America and to Nashville in 1825 is re- 
eorded in a resolution of the trustees that “the La Fayette professorship 
of Cumberland College” be established in honor of the national guest. 
A patriotic determination to endow a chair in honor of the “ Hero of 
New Orleans” likewise proved abortive. It is interesting to note that 
John Bell and Ephraim H. Foster were members of the committee 
appointed on the subject of these resolutions. As is well known, Bell 
and Foster in after years became, politically, strong anti-Jackson men. 
In 1834 the alumni society decided to raise $10,000 for the endowment 
ef a professorship of modern languages. But thefund grew very slowly. 
In 1848 the subscription lists had been open for fourteen years, and 
yet only $3,250 had been subscribed.

RELATIONS OF THE STATE TO THE UNIVERSITY. 
The fifth section of “An act to amend an act entitled ‘An act to 
establish a college in west Tennessee,’” passed in 1809 by the general 
assembly, made it incumbent upon the trustees of East Tennessee Col- 
lege and of Cumberland College to lay before every session of the 
assembly a report, financial and otherwise, on the condition of their 
respective colleges. When the general assembly, pursuant to this act, 
passed a resolution calling on the trustees of the University of Nash- 
ville for a report, the trustees referred the resolution to a committee. 
The report of the committee, made on October 14, 1831, contained a 
very spirited protest against any pretensions of the legislature to 
inquisitorial powers. The committee said they found nothing in the 
charter of the university that made the trustees responsible to the leg- 
islature for the discharge of their trust. The courts could call the 
trustees to account, but not the legislature. Yet considerations of 
policy and courtesy might require that the desired information be 
given the legislature. But it should be distinctly understood that the 
board of trustees acted of its own free will and not because it acknowl- 
edged itself amenable to the legislature. 
So much for that phase of the relations of the State and the uni- 
versity. The 40,000 acres of land in the western district that came 
into the possession of the University of Nashville in 1822 were obtained 
through the liberality of the State in remitting for twenty-eight years 
all taxes on land owned by the University ef North Carolina in Ten- 
nessee. In ceding the territory afterwards called Tennessee to the 
United States in 1790, North Carolina stipulated that the vacant and 
unoccupied lands in the ceded territory should be subject to the claims 
of her officers and soldiers of the Continental Line, and of others who 
had made entries. Furthermore, North Carolina reserved the right to 
complete all incipient titles to lands in Tennessee based on the above 
claims. In 1803, 1804, and 1806, on the part of North Carolina, Ten- 
nessee, and the United States, respectively, it was agreed that North 
Carolina should transfer to Tennessee the right of perfecting the afore- 
said titles. In accordance with this agreement the University cf North 
Carolina petitioned the legislature of Tennessee to issue grants on sun- 
dry lands in Tennessee on which warrants had been issued by the State 
of North Carolina, these warrants being based on military services per- 
formed by certain officers and soldiers of her Continental Line who had 
died leaving no heirs in the United States. The petition also prayed 
that until the 1st of January, 1850, the University of North Carolina be

released from paying taxes on lands owned by it in the State of Ten- 
nessee, and expressed a willingness to render an equivalent in return. 
By virtue of an act passed by the general assemby of Tennessee in 
answer to the petition, Governor William Carroll appointed commis- 
sioners to confer with the representative of the University of North 
Carolina. The result of the conference was a compact between the 
State of Tennessee and the University of North Carolina, August 26, 
1822, whereby the claims of the university to Tennessee lands based 
on North Carolina military warrants were declared valid, and the request 
of the trustees of the university that lands owned by them in Tennes- 
see be exempt from taxation until January 1, 1850, was granted on con- 
dition that the university give to such-public seminaries as should be des- 
ignated by the commissioners of Tennessee 60,000 acres of its Tennessee 
lands subject to the contract for locating and procuring grants already 
made by the agents of the university. The university guaranteed 
titles whose validity should he questioned at any time prior to January 
1, 1831. It furthermore agreed to turn over in like manner one-half of 
all military warrants which might thereafter be issued to it by the State 
of North Carolina, without, however, guaranteeing the titles. 
The commissioners assigned one-third of the lands thus obtained, or 
20,000 acres, to East Tennessee College, and two-thirds, or 40,000 
acres, to Cumberland College. In other words, by the generosity of 
the State of Tennessee in relinquishing her right to taxes on thousands 
of acres of land for the space of twenty-eight years, the University of 
Nashville became the owner of 40,000 acres of land in the western 
district of Tennessee. That many years elapsed before anything was 
realized from the possession was not the fault of the State. Thirty 
thousand three hundred and sixty-three and one-third acres of this 
land remained after the locators had received their share. The univer- 
sity’s share was sold in 1834 for $1 per acre, with interest, but only 
$15,000 were eventually realized. 
In 1837, the year in which the surplus in the Federal Treasury was 
distributed among the States, a joint committee of the two houses of 
the Tennessee legislature made areport on a complete system of educa- 
tion, embracing common schools, academies, and colleges. The chair- 
man of the committee on the report of the lower house was Washing- 
ton Barrow, a trustee of Nashville University. That the teachings of 
Philip Lindsley were bearing fruit is proven by this report. A scheme 
of common schools, academies, and colleges, the lower and the higher 
being essential the one to the other, and together making one magnifi- 
cent whole, is outlined and State aid recommended. A long passage 
is quoted from Dr. Lindsley’s inaugural address, and the arguments 
used by him to combat the prejudice against colleges are urged. But 
the legislature was not as enlightened as its committee and the recom- 
mendations were not adopted.

THE CONGRESSIONAL LAND GRANT AND THE FINANCES OF THE 
UNIVERSITY. 
By the act of April 18, 1806, Congress retained its ownership of all 
public lands in Tennessee south and west of the Congressional 
reservation line, but granted to Tennessee all public Jands north and 
east of that line. The stipulations made in the grant, which were 
accepted by Tennessee September 26, 1806, were that Tennessee should 
locate in one tract the 100,000 acres appropriated to academies. In 
the same way were to be located the 100,000 acres_set aside for col- 
leges. Both tracts were to be within the limits reserved by the State 
of North Carolina for the use of the Cherokee Indians, on lands, how- 
~ ever, to which the Indian title had been extinguished. These Indian 
Jands lay south of the French Broad and Holston Rivers, and west of 
the Big Pigeon River. The disposition of the college and academy lands 
was to be in the hands of the Tennessee legislature, but they were not 
to be sold for less than $2 per acre.! Now, all of the Cherokee land 
“which was fit for cultivation and to which the Indian title had been 
extinguished ” had been settled prior to 1806 by white men, although 
it had never been subject to entry. North Carolina, in the act of ces- 
sion, confirmed the rights of preémption and oceupancy of these settlers, 
and Congress itself in this very act of 1806 further confirmed those 
rights by enacting that no settler should be allowed more than 640 
acres, and that not more than $1 an acre should be paid to the State 
for the land. : 
In short, Congress had provided for the sale of 200,000 acres of land at 
not less than $2 per acre and in the self same act had virtually disposed 
of it at $1 per acre. Congress could and should have avoided all 
chance.of misunderstanding by appropriating land that was not already 
occupied by men who had lived on it for years and. who would be sure 
to resist any claims but their own as encroachments upon their rights. 
Tennessee could carry out the spirit of the trust only by doing one of 
three things: charge the occupants $2 per acre, sell 400,000 acres at $1 
an acre instead of 200,000 acres at $2 an acre, or wait until the Indian 
title to still other lands should be extinguished and then appropriate 
them. But Tennessee did none of these things. The first step taken re- 
duced the educational fund by one-half: the general assembly, on the 6th 
of September, 1806, enacted that holders of lands south of French Broad 
and Holston Rivers, and west of Big Pigeon River could perfect their 
titles by the payment of $1 an acre, payments to be made in ten equal 
annual installments, beginning March 1, 1808, with interest. One hun- 
dred thousand acres of land were directed to be laid off for the use of 
academies and as much for the use of colleges. Not three months had 
elapsed before the legislature passed an act extending for one year the 
time of payment for each installment. This policy once begun was con-

tinued, Success in securing the remission or postponement of one pay- 
ment only emboldened the occupants of the college lands to again peti- 
tion the legislature for relief. Demagogy no doubt had a hand in this. 
The petty politician could play no more pleasant réle than that of posing 
as the friend of the people against some distant “college” that was 
trying to rob them of their homes. In 1823 one-third of the principal 
and interest was altogether remitted. Considerable payments were 
made in 1824, but in 1825 the occupants of the lands refused almost 
unanimously to pay any more. The minutes of the proceedings of the 
board of trustees are largely taken up with resolutions and plans of 
one kind or another to secure the money due them on the Hast Fennessee 
lands. As early as 1825 a committee was appointed to memorialize 
Congress. In 1834 a committee prepared a memorial to Congress giv- 
ing a history of the land grant and praying to be fully indemnified by 
another grant. Nothing came of the memorial. In 1835 we find the 
trustees resolving to apply to the legislature for a bank charter; the 
bank to have a capital of $1,000,000 and to pay the university $5,000 
annually. In consideration of the charter they were willing to forego 
their claims to the congressional lands. How characteristic of the 
times that sober college trustees should wish to engage in wildcat 
banking! 
In 1837-38 the general assembly offered to the university in lieu of 
its congressional land claims a half township of land, or 11,520 acres, 
in the Ocoee district, which had just been acquired from the Indians. 
The offer was accepted and the vexatious matter was at last settled. 
Forty thousand dollars were received from the sale of the Ocoee lands 
in 1839-40. The money was invested, mostly, in Tennessee bonds and 
constituted the first productive fund the university ever had. The 
great check to the expansion of Nashville University was its lack of 
means. Had it not been for this lack, there can be little doubt that 
Philip Lindsley would have appreached a realization of his ideal uni- 
versity. 
Of the several methods devised for raising money, the lottery scheme 
was of a kind withthe bank scheme. The privilege of raising $200,000 
by means of a lottery was granted by the State in 1826. The trustees, 
it would seem, sold their privilege or a part of it, but we do not know 
how much they realized. 
The university was continually borrowing money on the security of 
individual trustees. Private subscriptions, skillful investments in real 
estate, and tuition fees were its main financial reliance. For the year 
1848-49 tuition fees amounted to $3,220. This was considerably less 
than for previous years because of the small attendance that year. 
The income derived from the invested proceeds of the sale of the Ocoee 
lands was $2,700. The sagacity of Dr. Lindsley led to the purchase in 
1825 of 120 acres of land near the college grounds, at $60 an acre. Ninety
-P-A-G-E-46

acres of this were afterwards sold for $17,000, and a house for the presi- 
dent was built on a part of the remaining 30. 
In 1847 it was decided to change the site of the university and to 
erect new buildings. The old buildings were becoming unfitted for col- 
lege purposes, the moral reputation of that part of the city was not 
good, and the municipality wanted to extend College street through the 
university property, which would necessitate the demolition of Cum- 
berland Hall. <A lot was accordingly bought in the South Field, on 
the Franklin turnpike, for $11,000. Small purchases and sales of other 
real estate were made, 1845-1848. 
On the 13th of April, 1850, the university was estimated to be worth, 
debts deducted, $116,000 lower limit and $140,000 upper limit. The 
Ocoee fund represented $40,000 of this and real estate from $76,000 to 
$97,000. One-third of the wealth of the university, so the committee 
who'prepared this financial statement thought, came from the enhance- 
ment in the value of its real estate during the preceding five years. 
A committee appointed in 1849 to carry out the determination taken 
in 1847, to sell the old college site or so much of it as could be spared. 
and to put up new buildings on the South Field lot, sold the main col- 
lege building, but did little looking towards the erection of new build- 
ings in the South Field. In fact, they were never erected there, but 
were erected on the tract of land on which stood the president’s house, 
Reference has been made to several of the causes that led to the sus- 
pension of the University of Nashville. A new cause now arose, one 
that no human foresight could predict, the cholera. It prevailed in 
Nashville to such an extent during the college years 1848-49 and 1849- 
50 that some students left the university and others were prevented 
from coming. This so diminished the already slim resources of the 
university that it seemed impossible to keep it open longer. With a 
view to meeting the emergency President Lindsley drew up his “ Hints 
for a plan of university studies” in May, 1849, and presented it to the 
board at its next meeting in August. This plan proposed the almost 
complete autonomy of each professor in his own school. His salary 
was to be supplemented by and to be largely dependent upon the fees. 
of his school. Thus, every professor being incited to do his utmost,to 
obtain pupils, it was hoped the attendance at the university, and there- 
with its revenues, would increase. The board of trustees accepted the 
plan with slight mogifications and decided that it should go into opera- 
tion atthe opening of the next term. Butin April, 1850, it was decided 
to postpone its adoption until the beginning of the next school year. 
As the college closed its doors at the end of the current year the sys- 
tem never went into force. 
RESIGNATION OF DR. LINDSLEY. 
A desire to rid the trustees of all hindrances to perfect freedom of 
action in reorganizing the university upon the new basis was one of 
the causes that led Dr. Lindsley to send in his resignation, March 23,
-P-A-G-E-47
  THE UNIVERSITY OF NASHVILLE. 41 
1850. At the unanimous request of the trustees Dr. Lindsley consented 
to withdraw his resignation, at the same time declaring that he would 
retire from the presidency whenever the board deemed that the inter- 
ests of the university demanded it. In May, 1850, he was called to the 
chair of ecclesiastical polity and biblical archeology in the New 
Albany Theological Seminary. On the second day of October, 1850, 
the relations that had existed for twenty-six years between Philip 
Lindsley and the University of Nashville came to an end. Most fit- 
ting was it that his last official act should be the payment of a loving 
tribute to the memory of his deceased colleague, Dr. Troost. Prof. 
Hamilton had died in 1849, and there remained only one, Prof. Cross, 
of the three with whom Dr. Lindsley had labored so long. Dr. Linds- 
ley accepted the professorship in the New Albany Theological Semi- 
nary. He resigned it in April, 1853. He died in Nashville May 23, 
1855, while attending as a commissioner the general assembly of the 
Presbyterian church. Dr. Lindsley’s biographer, Dr. Le Roy J. Hal- 
sey, has passed judgment on his work in Tennessee, and the South- 
west in these words: “We felt that, if Nashville should ever erect 
a public monument to any man, the honor was due to her eminent 
educator, Philip Lindsley. Whether, then, we measure the results of 
his great life work by its special effect upon the city of his adoption, 
or by its wider influence upon the progress of education in Tennessee, 
or by its still wider impression upon the whole Southwest through the 
influence of his pupils, not to speak of his writings and general influ- 
ence abroad, we think it can not be questioned that he has left his 
mark deep and ineffaceable upon his country and his generation.” 
SUSPENSION OF THE UNIVERSITY. 
September 14, 1850, the trustees passed a resolution to suspend the 
operation of the university for a limited time, fixing the 1st of January, 
1852, as a probable date of resumption. The reasons assigned for the 
suspension were that the faculty had been broken up by resignations 
and deaths, that the number of students was unusually small, that the 
income of the university was not sufficient to meet the expenses, and 
that it would be very difficult to continue while the old buildings were 
being torn down and new ones erected. At a meeting in October Dr. 
Felix Robertson, who had been a member of the board for forty-one 
years, was elected its president to sueceed Dr. Lindsley. 
PERIOD FROM 1850 TO 1861. 
ESTABLISHMENT OF THE MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. 
While the literary department of the university—so far the only 
department—was suffering an intermission, a new department, the 
medical, was being organized and established on a firm footing. 
Philip Lindsley’s plan of a completed university included, of course,
-P-A-G-E-48
  42 HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE. 
professional departments. He asserted in a public address that 
Nashville was the only place in Tennessee for a university, if for 
no other reason than that a medical school could flourish only in a large 
city. Even before Cumberland College became the University of 
Nashville a movement was started to found a medical school in connee- 
tion with it. The project came up several times before the final estab- 
lishment of the school in 1851. In 1844 the board of trustees passed 
unanimously a set of resolutions introduced by Dr. Lindsley that out- 
lined a policy differing radically from that under which the medical 
school as finally founded achieved such success. The tenor of the 
resolutions was that, while the university should be at no expense 
whatever, it should yet exercise entire supervision and control over the 
new department. No student was to be graduated unless he were aB. 
A. or could stand a satisfactory examination in classical literature and 
the liberal sciences. Dr. Lindsley’s ideas were not in accord with the 
popular ideas as to what a medical school should be, but hardly any- 
one will gainsay that if these ideas were carried out the rank and file 
of the medical profession would be on a higher plane than they are. 
Dr. W. K. Bowling and Dr. J. Berrien Lindsley, a son of Philip 
Lindsley and a graduate of the University of Nashville, deserve the 
eredit for inaugurating the movement that terminated in the successful 
establishment of a medical department. And this, although they were 
assisted by several other prominent physicians. 
In a series of letters to Dr. W. A. Cheatham, of Nashville, beginning 
in March, 1848, Dr. Bowling unfolded his plan for a medical school in 
Nashville. He thought that the faculty should be composed of Nash- 
ville physicians, so as to receive local sympathy and codperation. He 
- also thought it wise to go under the name and insure the influence of 
~ the University of Nashville. The Nashville doctors, to whom Bowling’s 
letters were shown, considered his plan Utopian. In the early part of 
1850 he removed to Nashville, still with the vision of a medical school 
in his brain and, what was more, with the settled purpose of making it 
a reality. 
In the mean time, Dr. Charles Caldwell, of Louisville, had been in Nash- 
ville trying to found a medical school, and had interested in his project, 
among others, Dr. J. Berrien Lindsley. Dr. Caldwell returned to Louis- 
ville without founding his school, but the idea had so taken possession 
of the mind of Dr. Lindsley that he spent the winter of 1849-50 visiting 
the Louisville, New York, and other medical schools. Some time after 
his return, in September, 1850, he called on Dr. Bowling. The right 
men had at last met and the plans for a medical college now rapidly 
crystallized. Others were drawn into the enterprise, a medical club 
was formed, and Dr. Bowling drew up a petition to the trustees of the 
University of Nashville asking for such powers as would reverse Philip 
Lindsley’s “idea of a medical school’s utter dependence upon the parent 
institution.”
-P-A-G-E-49
  
THE UNIVERSITY OF NASHVILLE. 43 
Such quick action was not without outside stimuli. The Tennessee 
legislature had at its session of 1849-50 created a law board and a 
medical board of the trustees of the University of Nashville, and this 
without the application or knowledge of the regular board. By this 
unheard-of move on the part of the legislature eighteen'new trustees, 
nine medicai and nine law, were added to the old trustees, who num- 
bered nineteen. When the new beards notified the old board, in March, 
1850, that they were ready to codperate with it on all matters embraced 
in the provisions of the recent act of the legislature, the old board 
replied that it could not legally codperate with them because it did not 
recognize as valid the law by which they were created trustees. The 
old trustees asserted the inviolability of their charter rights; at the 
same time assuming a conciliatory attitude and expressing a willing- 
. ness to join the new boards as far as they legally could in any measures 
looking toward the welfare of the university. Upon the refusal of the 
old board to recognize the new boards the latter proposed to submit 
the dispute to the members of the supreme court. This was done and 
a decision given in favor of the old board. 
Meanwhile Dr. Bowling, Dr. Lindsley and their colleagues had taken 
a step which insured success to their enterprise, whatever might be the 
issue of the dispute between the old and the new boards. A lease of 
grounds and buildings from the old board would hold good no matter if 
the new boards should afterwards come into power. The knowledge of 
this spurred them to immediate actiog. The memorial drawn up by Dr. 
Bowling with Drs. Jno. M. Watson, W. K. Bowling, Robert M. Porter, 
A. H. Buchanan, Charles K. Winston, and J. Berrien Lindsley, as 
signers, was presented to the trustees of the University of Nashville, 
September 28, 1850. The signers asked extraordinary powers and 
privileges and offered in return extraordinary considerations. What 
they wanted was a lease of twenty-two years. They would out of their 
private means enlarge the buildings and purchase the necessary outfit 
for a medical college—cabinets, apparatus, ete. At the expiration of 
the lease all this as well as what belonged in the first instance to the 
university would revert to it. Of course the tuition fees might not re- 
imburse the medical faculty for their expenditures. But it was a risk 
which they were willing to take provided they were given the supreme 
control over the affairs of the medical college. The charter of the Uni- 
versity of Nashville imposed upon its trustees the election of professors. 
No other body could do it legally. But this was incompatible with the 
perfect independence which the medical faculty wanted. The difficulty, 
however, was overcome by a provision in the contract that the trustees 
of the university should always elect to professorships the nominees of 
the medical faculty. 
The proposition of Dr. Bowling and his associates was accepted, and 
the board of trustees decided October 11, 1850, to establish a medical 
department. They, of course, chose as a faculty the six physicians

with whom the contract had been made. The faculty at once set to 
work with great energy. The old “east wing,” on Market street, which, 
they had leased from the university, had to be enlarged and fitted up 
for the purposes of medical instruction. An appeal to the public yield- 
ing only $3,000, the members of the faculty gave their personal notes 
and work on the building proceeded. In January, 1851, Dr. A. H. 
Buchanan was sent to Europe to purchase apparatus, books, and speci- 
mens. The organization of the faculty provided for a president and a 
dean. The former was little more than a presiding officer; upon the 
latter “devolved the duty of managing the entire machinery at home 
and representing the institution abroad.” From the opening of the 
school until 1868 the position of dean was filled by Profs. Lindsley, 
Eve, and Bowling, their terms of office being six, two, and ten years, 
respectively. Before the beginning of the first session, in October, 
1851, the faculty had been enlarged by the addition of Paul F. Eve as 
professor of surgical anatomy and clinical surgery, and of William T. 
riggs as demonstrator of anatomy. The professorships of obstetrics 
and diseases of women and children, of surgery, of the institutes and 
practice of medicine, of materia medica and pharmacy, of anatomy and 
physiology, and of chemistry and pharmacy, were filled respectively by 
Profs. Watson, Buchanan, Bowling, Winston, Porter, and Lindsley. 
Most of the professors had never faced a class before, but they were 
all men of high standing in their profession. A new chair was created. 
in 1854, “the institutes of mediciwe and clinical medicine,” and Thomas 
R. Jennings was elected to fill it. The requirements for graduation, 
were: “(1) Three years’ regular study in the office of a regular physi- 
cian; (2) attendance upon two full courses of lectures in a regular school 
of medicine, the last of which must be in this institution; (3) four years’ 
reputable and regular practice will be accepted in lieu of one course of 
lectures, and such practitioner can become a candidate for graduation 
at the close of his first course; (4) the candidate for graduation must 
write a thesis on some medical topic and deposit it with the dean by 
the middle of the course; (5) the candidate must be 21 years of age and 
of good moral character.” In the announcement for 1854-55 we find 
the conditions for graduation less rigid; nothing is said about “three 
years’ regular study in the office of a regular physician.” The regular 
winter course of lectures began about the last of October or the first 
of November and ended about March 1. A preliminary course of lec- 
tures, beginning the first Monday in October, introduced the regular 
course. 
The American Medical Association had from the first insisted upon 
the necessity and desirability of a longer course of study. Agreeably 
to this desire, the medical faculty of the University of Nashville inau- 
gurated in 1855 a summer course in medicine, beginning the first Mon- 
day in April and continuing four months. This course was largely 
practical in character. Lectures were thus going on for nine months of
-P-A-G-E-51

the year. Nevertheless, from fear of losing patronage, no doubt, the 
authorities did not venture to require for graduation more than the two 
winter courses of four months each; yet the summer course was in a 
seuse compulsory, for the regular fee was $105, and no remission was 
made if a student did not take this course. Hospital advantages were 
secured from the opening of the school in the use of St. John’s Hospital. 
The general assembly of Tennessee at its session of 1851-52 passed an 
act to convert the old lunatic asylum in Nashville into a State hospital 
and offered the free use of the same under proper regulations to the 
University of Nashville Medical College. A medical library was in 
time collected. The students had access, besides, to the university 
library, which contained quite a number of volumes on medical science. 
Though the faculty spent thousands of dollars in putting up buildings, 
in forming a museum, and in making improvements and repairs, it was 
apayinginvestment. Nashville wasa small city, yet her medical school 
competed successfully with the old and well-established schools of Louis- 
ville and Philadelphia. The first session opened with 121 matriculates 
and closed with 33 graduates. The attendance steadily grew. The 
acme was reached in 1859-60, when 456 students were enrolled. In 
point of numbers the school now ranked second among the medical col- 
leges of America. Every Southern State was represented, in addition 
to California, Pennsylvania, and the District of Columbia. Even as 
late as February, 1861, when the mutterings ef civil war were heard, 
there were nearly 400 young men in attendance. 
THE LITERARY DEPARTMENT AGAIN. 
An act of the legislature of 1851-52 annulled the rule of past years 
by which the president of the faculty of arts had been ex officio presi- 
dent of the board of trustees, and directed that thereafter the presi- 
dent should be elected by the trustees from their own number; where- 
upon, Dr. Felix Robertson was unanimously reélected. The act also 
provided that the number of trustees should not exceed thirty. 
On one part of the old campus a flourishing medical school had 
sprung up under the auspices of the university, and from the other part 
all traces of old Cumberland Hall had been effaced by the thorough- 
fares of a growing city. The literary department was still without a 
home, much less was it in operation. At length, in February, 1853, 
the board of trustees took decisive action. A building and executive 
committee was appointed with power to erect college buildings on the 
Jand on which stood the president’s house, to nominate professors, and ~ 
to do anything necessary to the reopening of the university. The 
result of such vigorous action was that the corner stone of the main 
college edifice, a large two-story stone building, was laid on the 7th of 
April, 1853, John A. McEwen, a graduate of the university, delivering 
the address. In November a plan of reorganization was submitted by 
the committee and adopted by the board of trustees, and four profes-
-P-A-G-E-52

sorships were created and filled as follows: Rey. Edward Wadsworth, 
D. D., ethics and belles-lettres; Rey. Joseph A. Eaton, D. D., mathe- 
matics and natural philosophy; Rev. J. W. McCullough, D. D., ancient 
languages; and Rev. John Berrien Lindsley, M. D., chemistry and nat- 
ural sciences. Another chair, that of modern languages, was subse- 
quently established and E. P. De Zevallos elected to fill it. Prof. 
Eatow resigning, James L. Meigs, A. M., was chosen in his place, and 
he, too, resigning, the position was at length accepted by A. P. Stew- 
art, of Cumberland University, Lebanon, Tenn. 
A law department was established and William F. Cooper and Fran. 
cis B. Fogg elected professors. They were given entire control of the 
school, with the privilege of adding a third professor. Rooms in the 
Davidson County court-louse were secured and furnished. But only a 
few students attended the lectures of these two eminent lawyers, and 
these few were dispersed and the school broken up by the burning of 
the court-house a few months after the opening of the school. An 
attempt to establish a law department had been made as early as 1843; 
so that this was not the first one. 
In the summer of 1854 an offer of the board of trustees to receive 
Nashville boys into the literary department of the university on the 
payment of two-thirds of the regular fees was accepted by the city 
council, The medical faculty supplemented this offer by making the 
medical course free to anyone graduating in the literary department 
on a Nashville scholarship. But this plan to coérdinate the public 
school system and the university was frustrated by the Know-nothing 
government of Nashville in the autumn of 1854. Indignant charges 
were made that this action was taken at the instance of some who 
wished to see the Nashville schools a preparatory department of Yale 
College. : 
The literary department threw open its doors to students in the 
autumn of 1854, But failure was soon seen to be imminent. A lack of 
harmony in the faculty in connection, probably, with other causes led . 
to the resignation of every professor in February, 1855. 
Temporary teachers for the few students who attended were obtained 
by the employment of Mr. Frank Crosby, of the city schools, and by 
the reémployment of Prof. Stewart. One cause assigned for the failure 
of the university was the competition of the city schools. If this was 
true, it deserved to fail, for public school instruction can in no way 
interfere with genuine college instruction. 
As all efforts to revive the literary department of the university 
seemed fruitless, it was proposed to use the endowment fund in the 
support of post-graduate or professional departments. But the propo- 
sition met with the legal objection that such a use of the endowment 
would be a perversion of the original trust. 
Since 1850 the former patronage of the literary department had been 
drawn off to other schools. New institutions had been continually

_ springing up. There seemed to be no field for an ordinary literary and 
scientifie college in Nashville unless it were heavily endowed and mag- 
nificently equipped. Ifthe University of Nashville was to be success- 
fully reinstated it must be by meeting some special demand or need of 
the time and section. This was Dr. J. Berrien Lindsley’s idea. He 
coneeived that a military college in the University of Nashville would 
succeed. As chancellor of the university he himself carried out his 
idea with a good measure of success. 
J. BERRIEN LINDSLEY BECOMES CHANCELLOR OF THE. UNIVERSITY. 
Dr, Lindsley was now for several years the head man of the univer- 
sity and the leading spirit in her councils. He was elected chancellor 
of the university February 19, 1855, being indorsed by his medical col- 
leagues as “the working man” of their faculty and possessed of their 
“unlimited confidence.” The chancellorship had been created in 1853, 
but with far less important duties than those with which it was now 
charged. The chancellor was now chairman of the different faculties 
of the university and representative of the academic faculty before the 
public. It was his duty to form plans for the reorganization of the uni- 
versity, to nominate professors, raise funds, advertise the school, and 
“generally to assist the board of trustees in increasing the reputation, 
enhancing the funds, and developing the usefulness of the university.” 
His salary, $500, was not commensurate with the importance of his 
duties, but it was raised the second year to $1,500. An executive com- 
mitee of three was created to codperate with him. 
LITERARY DEPARTMENT BECOMES A MILITARY COLLEGE, 
Chancellor Lindsley’s plan for the reorganization of the university 
was presented to the trustees March 9, 1855, and adopted. It pro- 
pose: the establishment of a scientific department and the rehabilitation 
of the literary department as a military college. The military feature 
was adopted merely as a method of government and discipline; the 
instruction was to equal that given in any reputable college. The 
scientific department was meant to be an advanced school of civil 
engineering, practical and agricultural chemistry, and of applied 
science, generally. : 
The Western Military Institute was chartered in 1847, under the laws 
of Kentucky. Being forced to change the location of the institute, on 
account of sickness among the students, the trustees secured a charter 
from Tennessee and removed the school to Tyree Springs, in that State, 
February, 1854, Liberal inducements to secure the school were offered 
in different localities in Tennessee, but the proposition to unite with the 
University of Nashville was the one finally accepted. The articles of 
union were adopted on the 4th of April, 1855. By them the Western 
Military Institute became the literary department of the University of 
Nashville. The proprietors, Col. Bushrod R. Johnson and Lient. Col.
-P-A-G-E-54
    48 HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE. 
Richard Owen, were given the use of the university grounds and build- 
ings free of rent. Beyond this the university did nothing. The military 
college was to be self-sustaining, the university assuming no pecuniary 
liability whatever. Cols. Johnson and Owen engaged to erect suitable 
buildings for the accommodation of cadets and to keep the property 
of the university in good order. The session opened the second Mon- 
day in September, 1855. The necessary buildings had cost $32,000, of 
which $18,000 had been subscribed by citizens of Nashville. A debt of 
$14,000 was left to hamper the proprietors. The faculty of the first 
year was composed of the two proprietors and of six others. <A. P. 
Stewart was elected professor of mathematics and civil engineering in 
the scientific department, and Dr. Lindsley hoped ere long to be able 
to establish two more chairs in this department. But the resignation 
of Prof. Stewart and the lack of funds forced him to abandon the idea 
of maintaining the department at all. In place of it the school of 
practical and agricultural chemistry was formed, and A. E. Ausman, 
M. D., placed in charge of it. 
The number of students in the military college beginning with 1855-56 
and ending with 1859-60 was in the order named, 154, 211, 202, 164, and 
192. A large percentage of the students were in preparatory classes. 
Six hundred and forty-eight cadets and medical students were enrolled 
in 1859-60. This was the flood- water mark of the period we are con- 
sidering. The total number of graduates, bachelors of arts and bach- 
elors of science in the military or literary department from 1855 to 1860, 
was 37. Financially the department was tolerably successful; the at 
tion fees sufficing to pay professors’ salaries and meet contingent ex- 
penses. ‘When the civil war commenced-it was fairly getting’ under 
way, was paying nearly $1,000 per annum interest upon the building 
debt, and spending quite that sum annually in making permanent im- 
provements upon the premises.” Yet the need of more buildings and 
ampler facilities was seriously felt. No system of management could 
supply the place of a large endowment. The real estate of the univer- 
sity was now valued at $300,000, and of bonds there were $56,000. 
George S. Blackie, M. D., became professor of botany in 1857, and the 
same year, owing to want of harmony between himself and Col. John- 
son, Col. Owen severed his connection with the college, Chancellor 
Lindsley taking his seat in the chair of chemistry and geology. 
MONTGOMERY BELL ACADEMY. 
Montgomery Bell, of Davidson County, well known as the pioneer 
ironmaster of Tennessee, died in 1855 and left in trust to the Univer- 
sity of Nashville the sum of $20,000 to be invested in State bonds or 
in notes secured by mortgages on real estate of double the value. The 
interest was to be used in maintaining an academy to be called the 
Montgomery Bell Academy. Here were to be educated male children 
to be selected by the trustees, who were “not able to support and
-P-A-G-E-55
THE UNIVERSITY OF NASHVILLE. 49 
educate themselves and whose parents” were “not able to do so.” Mr. 
Bell preferred that ten children should come from Davidson County 
and five each from Williamson, Dickson, and Montgomery Counties. 
None below 10 or above 14 years of age were to be received and they 
were to remain in the school until they were 18. Instruction was to 
be given in the English branches and in the classics according to plans 
to be mapped out by the trustees of the university. Indeed, the con- 
trol of the academy was to be vested in the university trustees. After 
considerable hesitation the trust was accepted in 1856, but for years 
none of its provisions were fulfilled except the one regarding the mode 
of investing the gift. The money was used, as directed, in the purchase 
of State bonds and the accruing interest was invested from time to 
time, so that when Montgomery Bell Academy was established in 1867 
its endowment had swelled from $20,000 to $40,000. 
THE CIVIL WAR. 
No minutes of any meeting between December 29, 1859, and June 21, 
1867, are found in the records of the board of trustees. The hand of 
war rested heavily on the University of Nashville. Officers and stu- 
dents forsook her peaceful halls for the din and carnage of the battle- 
field. Yet there remained a few who deserve all praise for their heroic 
efforts to still keep burning upon the altar of the university the sacred 
fires of learning. From the latter part of February, 1862, till early in 
1866 the grounds and buildings were in the hands of the United States 
military authorities, who used them as hospitals and barracks. During 
this time Chancellor Lindsley zealously cared for the property of the 
university. Though considerable damage was done to buildings, fences, 
and trees, yet little wanton mischief was committed. When the troops 
took possession they found Dr. Lindsley and three professors teaching 
some forty students. In 1863-64 Dr. Lindsley, aided by two assistants, 
undertook to conduct a preparatory school, but the death of one of his 
assistants compelled him to desist. 
the doors of the medical college were never once closed, even whilst 
the building was being used as a hospital. Literally surrounded by 
the dead and dying, professors still lectured and students still listened. 
“W hile the battle of Nashville was raging around the city” andeannon . 
were booming from Fort Negley near by, young men were being trained 
to go forth and heal the wounded and minister to the dying. The 
medical faculty could afford to indulge in a burst of exultation over the 
past and of hope for the future. “If its [the college’s] vitalities could 
not be chilled into suspended animation under such circumstances, its 
friends need scarcely fear anything that can happen to it hereafter.” 
The matriculates for the years between 1862-63 and 1873-74, inclusive, 
were 102, 32, 45, 33, 75, 127, 192, 209, 201, 186, 203, 240, 235, and 240. 
Although the school had never closed its doors, yet we can see from 
these figures that it did not recover its ante-bellum prosperity. In nS

course of the war several hundred physicians, both American and Euro- 
pean, visited Nashville and the university. They declared the museum 
of the medical department to be “splendid, copious, and unique.” The 
State hospital, which was under the direction of the faculty and open 
to the students, burned down in 1863. Four or five years later St. Vin- 
cent’s hospital was established near the college, under the control of 
the faculty. In 1869 the lease held by the faculty upon the grounds 
and buildings used by them was extended twenty years. This made it 
expire in 1892. 
AFTER THE WAR. 
No steps were taken to reorganize the literary department in 1866 on 
account of the prevalence of Asiatic cholera in Nashville. At the first 
meeting of the trustees after the war, June 21, 1867, Chancellor Linds- 
ley recommended and the board decided to delay no longer the per- 
formance of the duty imposed by the legacy of Montgomery Bell. 
Montgomery Bell Academy was opened the following September. No 
draft was made on the endowment fand for buildings. The uni- 
versity furnished them and kept thenfin repair. In accordance with 
Mr. Bell’s legacy provision was made for the education perpetually of 
25 scholars. ‘The school was also thrown open to pay scholars. Had’ 
this not been done, it would have been confined to avery narrow sphere 
and could never have expanded, as it has done, into a school offering 
advantages equal to those of many so-called colleges. Two courses of 
study were instituted, a high-school course of three years and a gram- 
mar-school course of four years. The grammar-school course was 
afterwards shortened to three years and a primary school created. Le 
Roy J. Halsey was elected principal of the academy and given three 
assistant teachers. The high order of work done by Montgomery Bell 
Academy, the lack of funds, and the prostration of the country after’ 
the exhaustive struggle of the civil war combined to delay the resusci- 
tation of the literary department of the university. 
Felix Robertson, president of the board of trustees, died, and on 
July 26, 1867, John M. Lea was elected his successor. 
During the years 1869-1872 another attempt was made to establish*a 
law school in connection with the university. Men eminent at the bar 
were chosen to fill the chairs, but to no avail. Few students attended, 
and the school languished and died. The men who lectured for longer 
or shorter periods were John C. Thompson, Judge Nathaniel Baxter, 
and Judge West H. Humphreys. Among those who heard their lec- 
tures were William K. McAllister, Robert Ewing, and J, W. Bonner, 
all well-known citizens of Nashville. 
ADMINISTRATION OF GENS. E. KIRBY SMITH AND BUSHROD R. JOHN- 
SON. 
We have come to the last attempt to maintain a regular literary 
or collegiate department in the University of Nashville. In May, 1870,
-P-A-G-E-57
  
THE UNIVERSITY OF NASHVILLE. 5t 
Gens. E. Kirby Smith and Bushrod R. Johnson made a proposition to 
the board of trustees to conduct for fifteen years a collegiate depart- 
ment and Montgomery Bell Academy as a preparatory school for that 
department, but the conditions of the proposition were such that it was 
rejected. It was not long, however, before an agreement was reached. 
As a necessary preliminary, Smith and Johnson raised by subscription 
$7,000 to repair the buildings and buy furniture. The university bound“ 
itself to appoint Smith chancellor and’ Johnson professor of appliea 
mathematics and principal of the collegiate department, but reserved 
untrammeled the right of electing to other professorships and of approy- 
ing or rejecting courses of study and methods of discipline. It was 
to furnish free of rent the use of its grounds and buildings, to provide 
apparatus and all the facilities for collegiate instruction, and to make 
appropriations for the instruction of the 25 Bell foundation scholars. 
Smith and Johnson agreed to make the undergraduate department, 
which included the college and the academy, self-sustaining, the uni- 
versity assuming for it no pecuniary liability beyond that of guaran- 
teeing professors’ salaries, 
For the first year or two the literary department under the manage- 
ment of Gens. Smith and Johnson met with fair success, but the need 
of a larger endowment, the financial crash of 1873, and the exhausted 
condition of the South compelled it to close its doors at the end of the 
fourth year, June 11, 1874. The ravages of war had almost swept 
away the preparatory schools of the South. As a consequence, when 
the colleges resumed, they had to take raw material and prepare it for 
the college classes or else go without students. All this is shown in the 
catalogues of the University of Nashville. 
For the session of 1870-71 there were 271 students, 239 of whom were 
in the academy, and only 32 in the college. For the session of 1873-74 
the corresponding figures were 156 and 31. In the third year of Smith 
and Johnson’s administration the class system was abolished and the 
elective system in one of itsforms adopted. The entire curriculum was 
embraced in nine schools, in most of which the course was two years 
long: Latin; Greek; French and German; English; mental philosophy 
and political economy; pure mathematics; chemistry and natural phi- 
losophy; natural history and geology, and engineering. 
A student elected what schools he pleased, but must elect at least 
three. The degrees, bachelor of science, bachelor of arts, master of 
arts, and civil engineer, were conferred upon the completion, usually, 
of the courses in certain schools. A new school, agriculture and me- 
chanic arts, and a new degree, bachelor of agriculture, were added. 
The military system as a mode of government and discipline obtained, 
but it was made hardly as prominent a feature as it had been before 
the war. 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
    52 HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE. 
MEDICAL DEPARTMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF NASHVILLE BECOMES 
THE MEDICAL DEPARTMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF NASHVILLE 
AND OF VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY. 
April 21, 1874, the medical faculty, with the consent of the board of 
trustees, entered into the following agreement with Vanderbilt Uni- 
versity: 
1. The Vanderbilt University accepts and adopts the several members of the 
present faculty of the medical department of the University of Nashville as its 
medical faculty by which medical students matriculating in the Vanderbilt Univer- 
sity are to be instructed in the various branches of medical science. 
2. The said students shall be graduated under the auspices, in the name, and with 
the diploma of the Vanderbilt University. 
3. This arrangement authorizes the publication and announcement of the said 
faculty as the faculty of the medical department of the Vanderbilt University, and 
the medical students so matriculating may be catalogued accordingly. 
4, The said medical faculty pledge themselves that the members of the faculty 
who may hereafter be chosen shall be men of the highest scientific attainments in 
their respective positions and of good moral character; also that the facilities and 
means of instruction shall keep pace with the improvements of medical science; that 
the faculty will supply and keep for the use of the students a museum with charts, 
specimens, and apparatus equal to the requirements of the most thorough medical 
instruction, and that clinical advantages shall be likewise secured. 
6. To facilitate official communication between the Vanderbilt University and its 
medical school or department there shall be a dean elected by the Vanderbilt Uni- 
versity, from its medical faculty, who shall be a member of the university senate. 
7. This agreement shall not be construed so as to involve the Vanderbilt Univer- 
sity in any pecuniary liability or responsibility whatever. 
8. Either party may dissolve this agreement by giving two years’ notice to the 
other, though it is hoped that it will work so harmoniously and be so efficient for 
public good as to be perpetual. 
The effect of this agreement was that Vanderbilt University without 
the payment of one cent secured a medical school that had existed a 
quarter of a century_and been famous in its day, and that even then 
was well and favorably known. On the other hand, the Vanderbilt 
brought to the Nashville Medical School the prestige of an institution 
under the patronage of a great church and supported by an endowment 
far greater than that of any other school south of theOhio. The result 
is that in the medical school the name of Vanderbilt University has 
eclipsed that of the University of Nashville. The change has doubtless 
attracted students, but the majority of them matriculate in Vanderbilt 
University and not in the University of Nashville. 
In May, 1870, Dr. J. Berrien Lindsley resigned the office of chan- 
cellor. He retained his chair in the medical faculty until 1873, when 
he retired as emeritus professor from active service. When the ques- 
tion of making the medical department of the University of Nashville 
also the medical department of Vanderbilt University arose, Dr. Linds- 
ley, although no longer officially connected with the University of Nash- 
ville, hazarded an opinion as to what should be the character of the
-P-A-G-E-59
  
THE- UNIVERSITY OF NASHVILLE. 53 
relation to be entered into between the two universities. He advocated. 
a union by: which the medical school should appear in the catalogues 
of each university as the medical school of that university, accompanied — 
by the statement that it was also the medical school of the other uni- 
versity. Expenses should be borne equally and benefits equally en- 
joyed. Neither would gain at the expense of the other. 
The lease of grounds and buildings from the university to the medical 
faculty had been extended until 1892 because the faculty had been at 
considerable expense in equippinga museum. The facultynow desired 
to erect a hospital on their leased grounds, and accordingly petitioned 
in June, 1875, for another extension of the lease. The petition was 
granted with certain conditions, the lease was extended thirteen years 
more, and the hospital was built. 
PEABODY NORMAL COLLEGE. 
The efforts of the trustees of the Peabody education fund in the 
South were directed first towards the building up and strengthening 
of the common school system. This was done partly by creating a 
public sentiment in its favor through tongue and pen; partly by wisely 
timed and wisely applied financial assistance. It was soon found that 
the greatest need in establishing an efficient public school system was 
intelligent and well-trained teachers. This led the board to decide 
upon the founding of one or more normal schools for the professional 
education of teachers. 
UNIVERSITY OF NASHVILLE AND THE PEABODY FUND. : 
The eyes of the Peabody trustees were first turned towards Tennes- 
see by the representations of Dr. J. Berrien Lindsley and the trustees 
of the University of Nashville. As early as June, 1867, Chancellor 
Lindsley advised the university board “ to correspond with the trustees 
of the Peabody fund in reference to codperating with them in this 
field.” Agreeably to this advice, Dr. Lindsley himself was requested to 
communicate with Dr. Barnas Sears, general agent of the Peabody 
fund. The University of Nashville early sought the devotion of the 
Peabody fund to normal schools and the establishment of a State nor- 
mal school in connection with the University of Nashville. When the 
State finally refused to grant an appropriation in aid of a normal school 
it was the University of Nashville that came to the assistance of Dr. 
Sears, and saved to Nashville and Tennessee the Peabody Normal Col- 
lege. 
The first effort to induce the State to found a normal school was dur- 
ing the legislative session of 1855-56, when Robert Hatton introduced 
a bill for the purpose. The bill passed the house, but failed in the 
senate. In 1873 Dr. W. P. Jones, State senator from Davidson County, 
introduced, among others, two bills. One of these became the present

public school law; the other, for the establishment of a normal school, 
failed for lack of time at the close of the session. his bill contem- 
plated the appropriation of $6,000 annually by the State to supple- 
ment the same sum from the Peabody fund. At the next session 
of the legislature Dr. Jones, though no longer a member of that body, 
at the request of Dr. Sears and the State Teachers’ Association, 
tried to secure the passage of a bill similar to the former one, but again 
without success. The sentiment in favor of anormal schoolhad grown 
too strong to be thus baffled. Dr. Jones wrote to Dr. J. Berrien Linds- 
ley, president of the State Teachers’ Association, suggesting the pos- 
sibility of obtaining a bill without an appropriation. This was the clue 
tosuccess. Aided by the feeling in favor of such a bill, created by a 
communication to the legislature from Dr. Sears and by an address 
delivered by himself before the State Teachers’ Association and the 
Tennessee State Grange, Dr. Lindsley succeeded in lobbying through 
the legislature the bill which made possible the existence of the Pea- 
body Normal College. 
STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION. 
The bill, which was approved by the governor March 24, 1875, ere- 
ated a State board of education, composed of six members, five, of 
whom were to be appointed by the governor, who was himself ex officio 
the sixth member and the president of the board. This board was em- 
powered to establish a normal school, but no appropriation was made 
from the State treasury. However, educational institutions were 
granted power to give the use of their property to the board for the 
benefit of normal schools. If the State was not generous, nobody 
else should be prevented from being so. In an amendment to the 
charter of the University of Nashville, passed the same day, the uni- 
versity was authorized to discontinue strictly literary or collegiate in- 
struction, and to make arrangements with the trustees of the Peabody 
fund or other associations for the establishment of a normal school. 
Towards the close of the session of the general assembly Dr. Sears 
offered, in behalf of the Peabody trustees, to give $6,000 annually to 
the maintenance of a normal school if the State would do the same, but 
the legislature adjourned without taking action. 
On the 10th of May, 1875, Dr. Sears made a proposition to the Uni- 
versity of Nashville trustees, then in session, that, if they would give 
to the State board of education for the benefit of a normal school the 
use of their grounds and buildings and the income from the university 
and Montgomery Bell funds for a period of two years, the Peabody 
trustees would appropriate to the same purpose $6,000 annually. Inas- 
much as the university board had for some time been seeking the estab- 
lishment of a State normal school in connection with the University 
of Nashville, the proposition of Dr. Sears was promptly accepted. A

tender was made to the State board of grounds, buildings, and endow- 
ment income for two years from September 1, 1875; not, however, with- 
out conditions. These were that twenty-five boys should receive free 
instruction according to the terms of Montgomery Bell’s will; that the 
university board should elect the principal and teachers and fix their 
salaries; and that buildings and grounds should be kept in repair out 
of the university revenues. The tender was accepted. Four of the 
six members of the State board of education were or had been officially 
connected with the university; one of the four had been chancellor 
and another was then president of the board of trustees. 
THE NORMAL SCHOOL THE WORK OF THREE DISTINCT BODIES. 
The normal school was thus the joint work of three distinct bodies: 
the Tennessee State board of education, the Peabody board of trust, 
and the board of trustees of the University of Nashville. It was 
called the State Normal School more with the hope that it would in 
time become identified with the State and be supported by it than 
because such relations really existed then. The school was, as it were, 
grafted on the University of Nashville. It was at the same time 
regarded as a continuation or revival of the literary department of the 
university. Not only did it occupy the grounds and buildings of the 
“old university,” but it inherited the university’s privilege of conferring 
degrees, 
As we proceed it will be seen that the Peabody board sharply dis- 
tinguished it from the ordinary State normal school. True, it was to 
be a normal school for Tennessee, but it was also to be a normal school 
for the whole South. It was to do a higher order of work than the 
ordinary normal school; to train teachers for the most responsible 
positions in the public-school service, and to be a center whence should 
be diffused the most advanced thought on the subject of education. 
As the legislature had made no appropriation for the support of the 
normal school the State board of education was not disposed to assert 
its legal right of control, but left the active management of affairs to 
the two other boards. Despite the reservation in the original agree- 
ment touching the election of the president, the university trustees 
asked Dr. Sears to select ahead for the new school. If, in this deference 
to Dr. Sears, they did not concede that any paramount legal authority 
resided in the Peabody board, they did acknowledge that it was proper 
for the Peabody board to decide the policy and character of the insti- 
tution. Prof. J. J. Backus, of Vassar College, was the first man to 
receive the appointment. On his declination it was offered, in Septem- 
ber, 1875, to Eben S. Stearns and accepted. As the appointee of the 
State board and Peabody board, Dr. Stearns was president of the State 
Normal School. As the appointee of the university board, he was 
chancellor of the University of Nashville. The twofold character of the  
-P-A-G-E-64
  56 HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE. 
school is well illustrated by this double title. Dr. Stearns was a native 
of Massachusetts and belonged to a family of educators. At 30 years of 
age he had been placed at the head of the State Normal School of Mas- 
sachusetts, “the first of its kind on American soil.” Here he became 
associated with Dr. Sears, who was then secretary of the Massachu- 
setts board of education. j 
By the terms of the original agreement the Montgomery Bell Acad- 
emy was to be attached to the normal school and to constitute its 
model, or training, department. Its patrons becoming clamorous for it 
to begin operations for the year, it was decided not to wait for the 
opening of the normal school. Accordingly, Prof. J. W. Yeatman 
and 8. M. D. Clark, former teachers in the Montgomery Bell, and 
Prof. W. R. Garrett were engaged, and the academy was opened in the 
university building. 
In November, 1875, the resignation of Judge John M. Lea, president 
of the university trustees, which had been presented some time before, 
was accepted, and Hon. Edwin H. Ewing, an old graduate of the uni- 
versity, elected to the vacant position. 
THE NORMAL SCHOOL OPENED. 
- Dr. Stearns inaugurated the Normal School under inauspicious cir- 
cumstances. Indifference, if not hostility, to the enterprise was writ- 
ten on the faces of most. Nevertheless, the school was organized on 
the Ist day of December, 1875. There were only 13 matriculates, all 
of whom were young ladies. Dr. Stearns began with only two as- 
sistants, both ladies—Miss Julia A. Sears and Miss Emma M. Cutter. 
There were no apparatus, no books, indeed scarcely anything that be- 
longs to the well-equipped school. But all these disadvantages were 
gradually overcome and the enterprise prospered. By the close of the 
first year the enrollment had increased to 60. A three-years course of 
study was mapped out, culminating in the degree of Licentiate of In- 
struction (L. I.). While this course would prepare one for entrance 
into the best colleges of the United States, it was equivalent in some 
respects and superior in others to the courses offered by many schools 
who styled themselves colleges. The instruction given was intended 
to be strictly professional. Everything was taught with a view to its 
being taught again. The curriculum was divided into three years— 
junior, middle, and senior—and embraced “a rapid review of the more 
elementary studies with reference to the best methods of teaching them, 
areview of the higher branches of knowledge with the same object, and 
acareful study of such other branches as time and circumstances” 
would “permit.” No fees, excepting a small incidental fee, were 
charged. This practice, once begun, has been continued. 
PEABODY SCHOLARSHIPS. 
In conformity with the purpose to supply the lack of normal schools 
in other Southern States, and to make the Nashville school a school for
-P-A-G-E-65

the whole South, as well as in accordance with the policy of more and 
more diverting the income of the Peabody fund to the training of 
teachers, twenty-five “‘ Peabody scholarships,” worth $200 a year for 
two successive years, were established in 1876 for States enjoying the 
benefit of the Peabody fund. No scholarships were allotted to Ten- 
nessee at the first, since she was peculiarly favored in the presence of _ 
the Normal School itself. Not until the year 1877-78 was the scholar- 
ship offer taken advantage of, and then only by 19. But as soon as 
it became generally known there was no lack of applicants. The 
trouble has been to select from them such as will fulfill all the conditions. 
The number of scholarships has been steadily increased until there are 
now 184, distributed as follows: Alabama, 16; Arkansas, 17; Georgia, 
22; Louisiana, 12; North Carolina, 20; South Carolina, 14; Tennessee, 
33; Texas, 20; Virginia, 18; West Virginia, 12. Tennessee was not 
given scholarships till 1883, In 1885 the 17 scholarships enjoyed by 
Florida and Mississippi were withdrawn from them and apportioned 
among the other States because they had repudiated their bonds, some 
of which were held by the Peabody trustees. 
Heretofore there have been only 114 Peabody scholarships; it is for 
the future that the number is 184; and the value of each scholarship 
has been $200; henceforth each scholarship will be worth $100 and rail- 
road fare to and from Nashville. The value of a scholarship is thus 
made the same to every holder, no matter where his place of residence 
is. 
So far as scholarships ave not filled from students who have been in 
the college a year or more at their own expense, they are awarded in 
the several States on competitive examinations held by the State super- 
intendent of public instruction or by examiners appointed by him, the 
the questions being prepared by the president of the college. Every 
effort is made to fill the scholarships with men and women fitted in all 
things to make good teachers. Applicants must declare their intention 
of making teaching a profession, of remaining at the college two years 
if the scholarship is continued so long, and, if opportunity offers, of shar- 
ing with their State the benefit of their training by teaching two years 
in her public schools. Besides, a scholarship will not admit to the low- 
est or freshman class: “(A scholarship is good for auy two consecutive 
years above the freshman class; that is, for sophomore and junior, or 
for junior and senior, or for senior and postgraduate.” 
In 1878 the name of the school was changed to the State Normal Col- 
lege. This same year Dr. Stearns, in his report to the university trus- 
tees, expressed it as his belief that the course of study, although not 
identical with the usual college course, was yet its equivalent, if not 
more, and stated that Dr. Sears concurred in this belief. Thereupon a ~ 
fourth year was added to the curriculum and the bachelor’s degree 
ordered to be conferred whenever the whole course was completed.

REMOVAL OF THE NORMAL COLLEGE AGITATED, 
_ ‘The legislature had disappointed the expectations of the friends of 
the Normal College by refusing to make an appropriation for its sup- 
port. The college was growing rapidly and demanded larger revenues, 
more room, and ampler facilities. The Montgomery Bell Academy was 
not asuccess as a model school, and the relations with it were therefore 
dissolved. But it still occupied a part of the buildings and premises, 
and could not be dispossessed, for by contract its professors were enti- 
tled to the use of their present quarters until September, 1882. Further- 
more, with the dissolution of the connection between the academy and 
the college the whole of the Montgomery Bell revenues passed under 
the control of the Montgomery Bell faculty and the college derived no 
benefit from them. To meet this falling off in receipts the Peabody 
trustees increased their annual appropriation to $9,000. 
This condition of things was disappointing to the hopes and plans of 
the Peabody board and the removal of the Normal College began to be 
mooted. Negotiations were opened between Dr. Sears, general agent of 
the Peabody fund, and Gustavus J. Orr, State school commissioner of 
Georgia, in November, 1878. In October, 1879, the Georgia legislature 
passed a bill creating the “ Georgia State Normal College” and appropri- 
ating $6,000 annually to its support, provided the Peabody board would 
do the same. Atlanta and other towns made liberal offers to secure the 
location of the college. There were, however, grave objections attach- 
ing to the conditions of Georgia’s offer. But despite these an agree- 
ment was reached for the transfer of the Peabody interests to Georgia. 
All that remained was the consent of Dr. Stearns, to whom, as the man 
who had successfully organized and set going the Normal College, was 
left the ultimate decision. Dr. Stearns could not divest himself of the 
idea that Nashville was the place for the college, and that if the people 
could only be made to open their eyes they would not permit it to be 
removed. But he found it hard to open their eyes. At last he suc- 
ceeded. A meeting of citizens subscribed and pledged $4,000 annually 
until the subscribers should be relieved by the legislature, and the 
trustees of the University of Nashville formally engased themselves 
April 21, 1880, on condition that the Nermal College remained in Nash- 
ville, to remove the Montgomery Bell Academy from the university 
buildings by October 1, 1880, and to turn them over to the college, to 
raise by mortgage or otherwise $10,000 for making improvements and 
purchasing apparatus, and to appropriate to the college the interest 
on the university endowment of $50,000 Tennessee bonds, reserving 
enough to pay the interest on the $10,000 to be borrowed and to keep 
the grounds and buildings in repair. 
These pledges of the citizens of Nashville and the university trustees 
were satisfactory to Dr. Sears. Some delay in carrying them out was 
occasioned by the death of Dr. Sears in July, 1880. The trustees 
feared that the Peabody board might not sanction the action of its

general agent. Being assured on this point, they erected outside the 
university campus a building for the special use of the Montgomery 
Bell Academy and built on the campus a residence for the chancellor 
of the university and president of the college. 
TENNESSEE MAKES ITS FIRST APPROPRIATION TO THE NORMAL 
COLLEGE. : 
In 1881 the Tennessee legislature made its first appropriation to the 
State Normal College, $10,000 annually for two years. Of this sum 
$2,500 were “‘intrusted to the State board of education for the higher 
and normal education of the children of Tennessee of African descent” 
in approved institutions of learning, while another $2,500 were for 
the establishment of $100 scholarships in the normal college, one to 
each senatorial district in the State. As the Negro beneficiaries of this 
act were of course educated in colored schools, the State Normal College 
did not receive, either directly or indirectly, the benefit of more than 
three-fourths of the State’s appropriation. 
In 1883 the general assembly consented to appropriate, free from all 
encumbrance, $10,000 annually to the Normal College if the general 
agent of the Peabody board of trustees would allow to Tennessee Pea- 
body scholarships and allow them on the same condition as those 
granted to other States. This was done and Tennessee received four- 
teen scholarships. The annual appropriation of the State has been 
$10,000 until the present year, when the legislature increased it to 
$15,000 on condition that each of the thirty-three senatorial districts in 
the State be allowed one Peabody scholarship of $100 and railroad fare 
to and from Nashville. The condition was complied with. The Pea- 
body board has also inereased its appropriation. It is now about 
$15,000 a year. The regular appropriation does not hinder the board 
from making other appropriations for special purposes. 
During these years the college was steadily progressing. Impreve- 
ments were made on grounds and buildings and a portion of the 
“old faculty house,” was converted into a gymnasium. The number 
of students grew from 60 in 1876 to 178 in 1887. In April of the 
latter year Dr. Stearns died and Prof. Penfield was called upon to dis- 
charge temporarily the duties of the presidency. The Hon. Alexander 
J. Porter was made chancellor of the university pro tempore. Mr. Por- 
ter had been president of the university board of trustees since the 
resignation of the Hon. Edwin H. Ewing in 1884. In 1888 President 
Porter died and in March ex-Governor James D. Porter was elected in 
his stead. 
W. H. PAYNE BECOMES PRESIDENT OF THE COLLEGE AND OHAN- 
CELLOR OF THE UNIVERSITY. 
On whom was to devolve the election of a successor to Dr. Stearns? 
Local or State control of the normal college was inconsistent with the  
-P-A-G-E-72
  60 HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE. 
conception of it as a school for the whole South. The Peabody trus- 
tees had no disposition to surrender to any other man or body of snen 
the choice of a head for the institution which owed its existence chiefly 
to them and whose whole course from the beginning had been shaped 
by them. Yet there was an inclination in some quarters to anticipate 
the action of the Peabody trustees and interfere in the election of a 
president. Happily the inclination was not a strong one. 
Dr. J. L. M. Curry, the former general agent of the Peabody fund, 
but at this time Minister to Spain, happened in this emergency to come 
home on leave of absence, and Mr. Robert C. Winthrop, chairman of 
the Peabody board, enlisted his aid in the selection of a president. He 
chose William H. Payne, professor of pedagogies in the University of 
Michigan, and his choice was unanimously ratified by the Tennessee 
State board of education and the board of trustees of the University 
of Nashville. Dr. Payne at first declined to come to Nashville, and it 
was not until the wide field of usefulness and influence that awaited 
him here and the strong probability that the Normal College would at 
the expiration of the Peabody trust become the “residuary legatee” of 
the Peabody fund were fully laid before him that he finally gave his 
consent. In the words of Mr. Winthrop, Dr. Payne “is widely known 
as a Christian scholar and gentleman, the author of valuable educa- 
tional works, and a most successful administrator and teacher.” The 
prosperity of the Peabody Normal College—known as such since about 
the time of his advent to office—has been very marked under his admin- 
istration. Advance has been made along every line. The attendance 
has grown rapidly, being 177 in 1887-88 and 422 in 1890-91. At the 
beginning, in 1875, 3 teachers were enough. ‘ Now there are 18—11 
male, 7 female. Chancellor Payne is himself professor of the ey 
theory, and art of education. 
Two new baccalaureate degrees—science and letters—have been in- 
troduced and the courses of study leading to these and to the degree 
in arts made partly elective. The master’s degree, also, is now offered. 
The names of the classes have been changed to the usual college des- 
ignations—freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior. A model school, 
or school of observation, has lately been built on the campus, at a cost 
of nearly $15,000. 
AIM AND CHARACTER OF THE PEABODY NORMAL, 
The strictly professional training of the school has been extended 
and widened and now embraces a complete course in the history, 
science, and art of education. Dr. Payne is heartily codperating with 
the Peabody board in its efforts to make the Peabody Normal a pro- 
fessional school of the highest order for all the Southern States. 
Heretofore all that, has been done towards the formation of educational 
doctrine, theory, and practice has been done in the colleges and uni-
-P-A-G-E-73

versities. Dr. Payne, himself not without reputation as a molder of 
educational thought, hopes to see the Peabody normal become a center 
whence will be disseminated among the smaller normal schools the most 
advanced ideas on the science and art of teaching. In arecent address 
he says: “It is not the province of this college to duplicate any normal 
school of the existing type. Its funds can be invested reproductively 
only by educating men and women who in some large sense will become 
the teachers of teachers, or who will mold public opinion over wide 
areas—men and women who, instead of teaching for a period of two or 
three years, will be more likely to follow the profession of teaching as 
a vocation.” e 
The Peabody Normal College seeks to impart, so far as its profes- 
sional character will admit, the spirit and the training of the scholar. 
Indeed it opines that “for real teaching, the teaching that molds cha- 
racter and inspires to intellectual excellence, there is nothing which 
ean be substituted for generous scholarship.” But it is still a profes- 
sional school and not a college or a university, and its curriculum can 
not take the place of the curriculum of a college ora university. It is, 
therefore, to be deprecated that it confers college and university degrees. 
Its reputation and its patronage are established beyond peradventure, 
and it could well afford to withhold its sanction from this reprehensi- 
le practice of the smaller normal schools. 
PEABODY NORMAL THE PROBABLE HEIR OF THE PEABODY FUND. 
There is a strong probability, if no more, that the Peabody trustees 
will, upon the expiration of their trust in 1897, settle the Peabody fund 
of over two million dollars on the Peabody Normal College. If this be 
true the old university will likely be restored in trunk and branch and 
the normal college become only one of her professional departments. 
The University of Nashville, renewing her life with her academic and 
her professional schools and her magnificent foundation of $2,000,000, 
may yet realize Philip Lindsley’s ideal of a great university, and his 
triumphant prophecy, “ We, the University, live forever,” may yet prove 
not to have been the vision of an idle brain.

CHAPTER III. 
THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE. 
By Prov. T. C. Karns, M. A. 
BLOUNT COLLEGE. 
The first house in Knoxville was built by James White in 1786. 
Four years later the “ Territory South of the Ohio River” was organ- 
ized. A Territorial legislature was elected in 1794, and assembled at 
Knoxville on Monday, August 25, of the same year. On September 10 
a law was passed establishing Blount College, at Knoxville, which was 
named in honor of the Territorial governor. From this beginning 
came the present University of Tennessee. The charter made Rev. 
Samuel Carrick president. Among the trustees we find such honored 
names as Blount, Sevier, White, Cocke, Ramsey, McClung, and Adair.! 
The institution was to be strictly nonsectarian—among the first of its 
kind in the United States. 
The new college was located on the square now bounded by Clinch, 
State, Church, and Gay streets, and a small two-story frame building 
was erected by ‘subscription. The land was donated by Col. James 
White, the founder of the city. 
President Carrick, though a native of Pennsylvania, was brought up 
in Virginia, and there married and ‘entered the ministry of the Pres- 
byterian Church. He came to Tennessee in 1788. In him were cen- 
tered all the virtues which characterized the Scotch-Irish settlers of 
this section of the country. oe 
The object of the school, as indicated in the charter act, was to 
instruct youth “in the various branches of useful science and in the 
principles of ancient and modern languages.” Tuition was’$8 for five 
months and board $5 a month. There was no endowment. The presi- 
dent’s salary was only $50 a month. Coeducation was practiced for a 
while. Barbara Blount gained high distinction among the young ladies. 
“College Hill,” the present seat of the university, was christened 
“ Barbara Hill” in her honor. 
Many eminent names appear in the early college records of students. 
Among them we find that of C. C. Clay, afterwards governor of Ala- 
bama and United States Senator; also Pryor Lea and T. J. Campbell, 
Congressmen; and W. B. Reese, the distinguished Tennessee jurist. 
The first and only graduate of Blount College proper was William E. 
Parker.

we EAST TENNESSEE COLLEGE. 
An act of Congress was passed April 18, 1806, providing for two col- 
leges in Tennessee—one in Hast Tennessee and the other in the west- 
ern division. Fifty thousand acres of the public lands were given to 
each college as an endowment. On certain conditions, Blount College 
proposed to be absorbed by the new institution for East Tennessee. 
Thereupon, the legislature incorporated Hast Tennessee College by act 
of October 26, 1807, and located it within 2 miles of Knoxville on 10 
acres of land donated by Moses White. The spot was known as Rocky 
or Poplar Spring, and is now in the Shieldstown addition to Knox- 
ville. The franchise and property of Blount College were then trans- 
ferred to the new school. 
A subsequent act (December 3, 1807) provided for the appointment 
of twenty-three trustees from the various counties of East Tennessee 
and seven from the immediate vicinity of the college. The influence 
of the school was thus to be extended. 
The trustees of East Tennessee College first met in 1808 and retained 
Mr. Carrick as president. He died suddenly on August 17 of the next 
year. As the college had not yet received anything from its land grant 
and was out of funds, no president was called to fill the vacancy. 
The national act of endowment had provided that the land should not 
be sold for less than $2 per acre, and should be located in a single body. 
This could not be effected without coming in conflict with the rights 
of settlers. A commission was appointed to manage the fund arising 
from the sales of land, but they could do little or nothing. The only 
Jands available were those south of the French Broad, Holston, and 
Big Pigeon rivers. Here the school grants were sought to be located, 
but politicians stirred up the settlers to resist, and no headway was 
made. 
The same act of Congress also gave 100,000 acres for the establish- 
ment of an academy in each county of the State. As a result of this, 
Hampden Sidney Academy was established at Knoxville, and, with 
some private aid, began work January 1, 1817. 
East Tennesse College had in the meantime tried a lottery scheme 
for raising money. Authority was. obtained from the legislature of 
1810. Tickets in sufficient numbers to justify a drawing were not sold, 
and the scheme went through. 
The college trustees still failed to get the school into operation till 
1820, when, by mutual consent, Hampden Sidney Academy and East 
Tennessee College were united under the name of the latter, Rev. David 
A. Sherman, principal of the academy, becoming president. Mr. Sher- 
man was a New Englander and a graduate of Yale. The next year 
(1821) David S. Hart took his degree from the new college. For some 
years he, with Daniel E. Wartrous and James McBath, assisted as an 
instructor in the school. Corporal punishment was common in those

days. Mr. Sherman resigned the presidency in 1825, but the exercises 
were continued for one year by two tutors, Samuel R. Rogers and James 
McBath. 
At an early day the University of North Carolina held warrants for 
lands located in Tennessee, about which there was much controversy. 
She finally compromised with Tennessee by giving 60,000 acres of her 
claim to certain institutions of learning inthe State. One-third of this 
amount was assigned to East Tennessee College. 
In 1826 the hill on which the present university stands was purchased 
for $600. Being more desirable as a location than the Poplar Spring 
tract, the college was moved to this place, where it has since remained. 
The old chapel, or center college, was then erected, together with three 
one-story dormitories placed at the rear of the éampus. Rey. Charles 
Coffin, D. D., of Greeneville College, was elected president. Dr. Coffin’s 
great attainments and success as an educator inspired much confidence. 
He was a native of Massachusetts and a graduate of Harvard. Rev. 
Stephen Foster accompanied Dr. Coffin in his new field of labor. Mr. 
Foster was also a Presbyterian, a native of Andover, Mass., a graduate 
of Dartmouth College, and likewise of the theological seminary at~ 
Andover. 
Dr. Coffin’s first work was crowned with great success, but the land 
warrant difficulties still remained unsettled and designing demagogues 
stirred up so much opposition on the part of the people that in 1832 
the venerable president resigned. Returning to Greeneville, he died 
in 1853. The first literary society—the Republican Dialectical Adel- 
phic—was established during his administration. 
Dr. Coffin was succeeded in 1833 by James H. Piper, a graduate of 
the institution, class of 1830. He resigned in one year and was suc- 
ceeded by Joseph Estabrook, a graduate of Dartmouth. 
President Estabrook put great energy into his administration. He 
had an able faculty, and possessed fine executive ability. His disci- 
pline was good. Success attended all his efforts. A very valuable 
cabinet of minerals, shells, botanical specimens, and natural curiosities 
was collected. During his administration many advances were made, 
In 1835 another literary society—the Dialectic Adelphic—was organ- 
ized. It lasted but ashort time, and in 1836 the two present societies— 
Chi-Delta and Philomathesian—were formed. The original motto of 
the Chi-Delta was Sua munera virtuti sunt; that adopted at its resus- 
citation after the civil war, per aspera ad astra. The original motto of 
the Philomathesian was Virtuti cedunt omnia. Since the war it has 
been Nulla vestigia retrorsum. Regular college classes were first organ- 
izedin1837. The first catalogue was printed for the school year 1837-38, 
In 1838 the trustees compromised with the State and the citizens 
living on the college lands south of the Holston and French Broad 
rivers by relinquishing their former claim and accepting a one-half 
township of land in the Ocoee District. In this forced adjustment the

institution lost at least half her endowment. In 1839 the preparatory 
department was taught in the Hampden Sidney Academy in town. _ 
EAST TENNESSEE UNIVERSITY. 
The legislature in 1840 changed the name of East Tennessee College 
to. that of Hast Tennessee University. All the usual rights belonging 
to universities, including the power to confer medical degrees, were 
bestowed through this act. About this time the university sold some 
of her lands and erected the two dormitories known more recently as 
East College and West College. What is now the infirmary, and also 
the front part of North College, were erected at the same time for 
professors’ residences. The total cost was $20,965.18. 
We learn from Col. White that corporal punishment was finally 
abandoned about 1840, The preparatory department is supposed to 
be referred to. The change was effected by a young tutor, Horace 
Maynard, who rose to the professorship, successively, of mathematics 
and ancient languages, ancient and modern languages, and mathemat- 
ies, rhetoric and belles-lettres. During the years 1841-42 and 1843-44 
a well-edited periodical called University Magazine was conducted by 
members of the senior class. Mr. Maynard, who afterwards became 
eminent as a statesman, resigned in 1843 and was succeeded by Albert 
Miller Lea. Prof. Lea was a West Point graduate and introduced the 
military feature. A company was organized and a uniform adopted. 
At the end of three years the military system was dropped. 
In 1847 a pipe was laid and water was thrown from a spring at the 
foot of the hill to the front of the chapel building. The water works 
were destroyed during the civil war. After a long and very successful 
administration, President Estabrook resigned in 18590. His most pros- 
perous year was, perhaps, 1846-47, when 169 students were enrolled. 
He died in 18565. : 
President Estabrook was succeeded by Hon. W. B. Reese. Judge 
Reese was a man of great attainments and popularity, but he came at 
a time when the multiplicity of colleges had shorn the university of its 
strength, and at the end of three years he resigned. Rev. John D. 
Wheeler, once president of the University of Vermont, was elected his 
successor, but did not accept. 
Rev. George Cook, a native of New Hampshire, was then elected. 
He was also @ graduate of Dartmouth College and had been for sey- 
eral years the successful principal of Knoxville Female Academy. The 
university affairs were in a very bad way. The session did not open 
till the beginning of the spring term of 1854. <A latinized catalogue 
was published at the end of the term. President Cook was then 
charged with hostility to slavery, and, to add to the trouble, Knoxville 
was visited with a violent epidemic of cholera about the time school 
should have opened. 
A proposition had been made to turn over the university property to

THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE. 67 
a medical college that was to be organized, and the attempt to select 
a faculty was made, but without success. A futile attempt was also 
made to consolidate the school with a certain Western Military Insti- 
tute of Tyree Springs, Middle Tennessee. President Cook also tried 
to have an agricultural department established in the university and 
then in 1857 resigned. 
The board next offered the presidency to Rev. Thomas W. Humes, 
but he declined. Later in the year J. F. Pearl, of Nashville, was 
elected, but he also declined. There being no faculty school was sus- 
pended for the year. 
Rev. W. D. Carnes, of Burritt College, Van Buren County, Tenn., 
was elected president on the 20th of March, 1858, and at once accepted. 
The new president was a Christian minister and an alumnus of the 
university, having graduated in 1842.- He was tutor in 1842-43 and 
principal of the preparatory department from 1843 to 1848. At a later 
date the faculty was completed as follows: M. C. Butler, anéientlan- 
guages and literature; A. C. Carnes, mathematics, and Rey. John 
Washburn, principal of the preparatory department. Tuition was put 
at $25 in college and $20 in the preparatory department for the term 
of five months. The president received from the endowment fund $400 
and each of his assistants $250. Their salaries were increased by a 
pro rata of all tuition fees. 
In the spring of the same year, a medical ALARA was admitted 
with the following faculty: 
John M. King, M. D., of Murfreesboro, professor of obstetrics and diseases 
of women and quatre 
B. Frazier, M. D., Pikeville, professor of theory and practice of medicine. 
O. F, Hill, M. p., Knoxville, professor of general and special anatomy. 
John M. Boyd, M. D., Knoxville, professor of materia medica and pharmacy. 
Richard O, Currey, M. D., Knoxville, professor of medical and physiolog- 
teal chemistry. 
This department was a result of the persistent efforts of Dr. Currey 
and the local medical society, but, owing to a failure of the university 
trustees to give it material assistance, never went into operation. 
‘President Carnes, very early in his administration, secured the eree- 
tion of a small gymnasium. The term opened on the second Thursday 
of September, 1858. In 1859 another attempt was made for a medical 
department, but without success. The attempt to establish a military 
department likewise failed. 
President Carnes secured from the legislature of 1859-60 a resolu- 
tion asking the supreme court to report the facts regarding the land 
grant of 1806, accompanied by their opinion of the right of the univer- 
sity to further compensation on account of failure to receive the full 
donation. Nothing seems to have come from this action. President 
Carnes, in the meantime, resigned. He was ‘succeeded by Dr. J.J, 
Ridley, of Clarksville.  
-P-A-G-E-80
  68 HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE. 
The winter session of 1860-61 opened with a largely increased at- 
tendance. The first measure was a resolution to educate, free of tui- 
tion, ministerial students of all denominations. This has prevailed as 
arule of the institution since that time. The military feature was 
again introduced and dicipline became rigid. The number of students 
more than doubled. This was the spring of 1861, when the war was 
fast gathering. Later the students enlisted in the army, teachers re- 
signed, and general disorganization ensued. The Confederate troops 
were soon ina portion of the buildings. President Ridley resigned 
February 7, 1862. The buildings were used as a hospital in 1862-63. 
In January, 1863, the trustees attempted to collect from the Confeder- 
ate authorities the sum due for rent and damages, to be applied to re- 
pairs and improvements. No success is reported. 
Knoxville was taken by the national troops September 2, 1863, and 
they, in turn, occupied the university buildings. The trustees met 
again March 19, 1864, and took steps toward obtaining damages from 
the United States Government. The sum of $15,000 as rents and dam- 
ages was finally paid. 
The ante-bellum career of the university was one of trials and pri- 
vations. Through no fault of its own the endowment fund had in 
great part been lost. The course of study was mainly in the classical 
line and all its culture bent that way. The broad gauge of the 
present-day university, with its numerous scientific courses and elec- 
tive branches, had not been reached. Yet the old ably met the 
demands of that day for professional and political life. 
AFTER THE WAR. 
The civil war closed during the spring of 1865 and on July 10 of 
the same year the board of trustees had a meeting and considered 
plans for reopening the university. Rev. Thomas W. Humes was 
elected president and at once accepted and assumed the duties of his 
office. 
President Humes is a native of Knoxville and an alumnus of the 
university, having graduated in the class of 1830. He had in early 
life conducted a newspaper, but later took orders in the Episcopal 
Church and for many years had been the worthy rector of St. John’s 
Parish. He was a man of profound convictions, fine culture, and good 
executive ability. His family connection, social standing, and singu- 
larly pure life gave him the confidence of all and eminently fitted him 
for the responsible work he was about to undertake. 
The two armies left little of the college property, except the unin- 
closed grounds and bare walls. Fortifications still remained banked 
against the buildings. These had to be removed and the buildings 
must be entirely renovated before it was possible again to occupy 
them.

THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE. 69 
In the meantime, President Humes secured the services of Prof. 
F. D. Allen, a graduate of Oberlin College, who came on to begin work 
in the spring of 1866. The buildings of the State Asylum for the 
Deaf and Dumb had been made vacant by the war and these were 
occupied while repairs were going on at the university. ‘i 
Owing to the disturbed condition of the country and the impover- 
ished state of the people, very little local patronage could be expected. 
On the opening morning only about 20 students were present. Most 
of the “town boys” were attending the Hampden Sidney Academy, 
which was flourishing under the principalship of Mr. John K. Payne, 
arecent graduate of Yale College. 
By a mutual agreement of the proper authorities, the academy school, 
as a whole, was transferred to the university, and its principal was 
elected to the department of mathematics. Prof. Allen had charge of 
the languages. Dr. John C. Minor, a talented young physician from 
New York City, was engaged to deliver lectures on scientific subjects. 
A boarding club, with reasonable rates, was organized for nonresi- 
dent students and professors. Some part of the university library had 
been rescued from the wreck of the war, and this was set up for the use 
of the school. <A literary society was also organized. 
The term closed July 20, with prize declamations at the old court- 
house. Col.John Baxter had founded four prizes, amounting to $20, 
for declamation. The university had determined to award twenty-four 
testimonials each session to the 24 students whose marks stood highest 
in “attendance, deportment, and scholarship.” Only students who 
took testimonials could compete for the Baxter prizes. The first of the 
Baxter prizes was won by Hugh B. Rice, who has since become an 
able minister of the Christian church. Hon. Thomas A. R. Nelson also 
gave four prizes, amounting to $20, for “punctuality and deportment.” 
More than 75 students were enrolled during the term. So far no 
advance had been made beyond preparatory work. 
September found the buildings and grounds at the university in 
good condition, and the winter term opened with promise on the 13th, 
Before the close 88 students had been enrolled. All entered the pri- 
mary department, which was divided into four classes, or sections. 
Dr. John ©. Minor was promoted from lecturer to professor of chem- 
istry and natural science. Mr. N. D, Parkhurst was employed to teach 
elocution. The rest of the faculty remained the same. A small read- 
ing room was established in connection with the library, which had 
been refitted and opened. Tuition was put at $10 for five months. 
From $3 to $5 paid for one week’s board. <A few students boarded 
themselves at a much cheaper rate. Only one regular course of study, 
the classical, was presented. Most of the students took this, though 
a few pursued. English studies alone. 
During the spring term of 1867 the number enrolled increased to 
122. Many young men who entered were advanced in years, having  
-P-A-G-E-82

been kept out of school by the recent war. Some bore military titles 
which they acquired as lieutenants and captains in the army. 
The two literary societies that flourished before the war, the Chi 
Delta and the Philomathesian, had been reorganized during the pre- 
vious winter term and had their respective halls fitted up in a comfort- 
able and tasteful manner. On the 5th of February they competed in 
prize declamations at the First Presbyterian Church. A. H. Nave, who 
spoke “Spartacus to the Gladiators,” afterwards graduated at West 
Point and became an officer in the U.S. Army. George and Louis 
Baxter, two other speakers, have each been candidates for governor. 
The prizes given were offered by Hon. T. A. R. Nelson and Prof, J. K. 
Payne. At the close of the year, in June, the Baxter prize for decla- 
mation was again awarded. 
In the fall of 1867 Rev. F. M. Grace, of Elyton, Ala., entered the 
faculty as professor of rhetoric and English literature. He was an 
alumuus of the university, having graduated in the class of 1849, He 
brought with him a large number of young men from his own State. 
They were known as the “Alabamians,” and marked an era in the his- 
tory of the school. It was the purpose of the management, in this 
move, to restore to the university its Southern patronage of ante-bellum 
days. Only a temporary success was achieved. In addition to his 
mathematical professorship, J. K. Payne was made principal of the 
preparatory department. The preparatory work required three years. 
Latin was studied the entire time and Greek for the last year and a 
half. Candidates for the freshmen class were examined in English 
grammar, geography, higher arithmetic, Loomis’s Algebra to Quad- 
raties, Loomis’s Geometry (two books), and the Latin and Greek required 
to complete the preparatory work. The entrance age was 14. There 
were 11 freshmen in 1868. Three recitations, or lectures, were required 
every day. Orderly students only were allowed to oceupy the dormi- 
tories. The government was paternal. In order to assist worthy young 
men of small means, and at the same time foster education, two students 
from each county of East Tennessee were allowed free tuition on con- 
dition that they would pledge themselves to teach for two years. H. 
T. Eddy was instructor for a short time. 
On July 2, 1862, Congress passed the land-grant act to establish 
agricultural and mechanical colleges in the various States. By this 
law each State was to receive 30,000 acres of the public domain within 
its borders for every Senator and Representative in Congress under 
the census of 1860. In case the land could not be found in any par- 
ticular State, scrip was to be issued to that State and sold, the pro- 
ceeds of which must, without diminution or loss, be invested in safe 
stocks bearing an interest of not less than 5 per cent. This interest 
was then to be, as stated in the act, “inviolably appropriated by each 
State * * * totheendowment, support and maintenance of atleast 
one college where the leading object shall be, without excluding other 
 
-P-A-G-E-83

scientific and classical studies, and including military tactics, to teach 
such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and the mechanic 
arts, in such manner as the legislatures of the States may respectively 
prescribe, in order to promote the liberal and practical education of 
the industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions in life.” 
Several conditions not necessary here to enumerate were appended to 
the grant, ‘ 
War and the subsequent unsettled condition of the State prevented 
Tennessee’s acceptance, on the terms proposed, till January 16, 1869, 
By act of this date, the legislature settled upon the Hast Tennessee 
University the whole fund which had been received by the State in 
land scrip to the amount of 300,000 acres. The State had taken the 
amount in scrip because so uch Government land could not be found 
within her borders. This was sold and the proceeds were invested in 
6 per cent, Tennessee bonds, with interest payable semiannually. 
The act further provided for the establishment of the Tennessee Agri- 
cultural College in connection with the university and appointed three 
additional trustees for each, from middle and west Tennessee. The goy- 
ernor, the secretary of state, and the superintendent of public instruc- 
tion were constituted ex officio members of the board. Not including 
the State officers, the board of trustees then numbered 36 members, all 
of whom had a life tenure. Among other conditions in the legislative 
act of appropriation, the university was required to have accommoda- 
tions for 275 students, and to own at least 200 acres of land for an 
experimental farm, all of which should be worth not less than $125,000, 
Two hundred and seventy-five students, two appointed by each State 
senator and three by each representative from their respective coun- 
ties, were to receive free tuition. The farm was to be carried on by 
the trustees of the university for purposes of instruction in agricul- 
ture. The profits of the farm crops were also to go towards defraying 
the expenses of indigent students. 
Later, in January, 1869, the university trustees met, and a certified 
copy of the act of establishment was laid before them. A resolution 
was adopted accepting the trust with its conditions, and steps were at 
once taken to comply with all the legal requirements. The institution 
already owned about 40 acres of land just west of the city, and on this 
tract were situated the six university buildings, which had recently 
been repaired and improved. The location was beautiful and in every 
way desirable. Three-fourths of a mile west of this a farm containing 
285 acres was bought, at a cost of $30,000. The soil was admirably 
adapted to the purpose in view. In May following the governor of the 
State was notified that the university had complied with all conditions 
in the act of endowment and the fund was directed to be turned over. 
The final amount transferred reached the sum of $396,000. 
In June the board organized the Tennessee Industrial College. This 
was only a department of the university, which the trustees, so far as
-P-A-G-E-84
  2 HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE. 
their means would allow, planned somewhat after Cornell and the Illi- 
nois Industrial University. Threeregular courses of study were estab- 
lished—the agricultural, the scientific, and the classical. In their 
reorganization of the school, the university management recognized 
the spirit and purpose of the Congressional act of endowment in refer- 
ence to industrial education. Yet they felt, while providing for the 
industrial school, that they were fully justified in retaining a classical 
course of study as a preparation for professional life and general cul- 
ture. Touching this point, President Humes, in his first biennial report 
to the legislature, said: 
The trustees are of the opinion that a great variety of collegiate instruction is 
within the sphere of the new college, as its objects and work are prescribed in the 
act of Congress. Evidently the intention of the endowment is to provide for the 
instruction, especially, of the industrial classes. Its intention is that the study of 
agriculture and the mechanic arts shall be prominent; that they shall be invested 
with all the attractions which science and mental culture can impart to them, and 
that the farmers and mechanics of the future shall generally be so well educated 
that their labor in the field or shop shall be, not a drudgery, as such labor must 
always be to the untrained and uninformed mind, but a work of intelligence and 
discrimination, performed with growing skill in the increasing light of scientific 
knowledge, and constantly attended with intellectual enjoyment to the workers. 
At the same time it is evident from the language of the act above cited that it was 
not the purpose of its framers to disparage the usual college curriculum, which 
largely consists of mathematics and the Latin and Greek languages, nor to under- 
rate the importance to society of the learned professions, into which college grad- 
uates have heretofore, in many instances, entered. Neither was it their purpose to 
shut the doors of the new college against young men who desire to study the clas- 
sics and to prepare themselves for professional employments in life; for the act of 
Congress explicitly states that no classical or scientific study is excluded from the 
field of instruction. Theleading object of the proposed institution shall be to teach 
whatever branches of learning relate to agriculture and mechanic arts; but what-, 
ever pertains to other departments of collegiate knowledge may also be taught 
within it. 
In order to meet the new demands the teaching force was largely 
increased. Dr. Humes was continued as president and professor of 
mental and moral philosophy. Prof. F.D. Allen, of the department of 
ancient languages, was granted a leave of absence to study at the 
University of Leipsic,in Germany. Prof. J. K. Payne retained the 
chair of mathematics, to which natural philosophy had been added. 
Prof. F. M. Grace took English language and literature, rhetoric hay- 
ing been dropped. The new professors were F. H. Bradley, mM. A., 
in natural science; R. L. Kirkpatrick, M. A.,in Latin language and 
literature; E. Dean Dow, M. A., in agriculture; I. H. Barker, mM. A., 
in modern languages; W. C. Atwater, PH. D., in agricultural chem- 
istry; I. T. Beckwith, A. B., instructor in ancient languages; M. CO. 
Butler, M. A., principal of classical preparatory department; and Wil- 
liam V. Deaderick, principal of English or scientific preparatory 
department. Prof. Dow did not accept the chair of agriculture, which 
was filled later by the election of Prof, Hunter Nicholson, horticulture 
 
-P-A-G-E-85
      THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE. 73 
being at the same time added to the department. Prof. Atwater 
did not take charge until the fall of 1871. Principal Deaderick 
taught half the year, and his place was then filled by J. V. Bradford. 
George L. Maloney and W. A. Rice were afterwards employed to give 
instruction in the classical preparatory department. Of the faculty, as 
now constituted, President Humes was a graduate of the university, 
Prof. Payne of Yale, Prof. Bradley of Yale, and Prof. Barker of Har- 
vard. Prof. Kirkpatrick graduated in the class of 1845 at the univer- 
sity and had occupied various positions in the university before the war. 
In order to inducé the legislature to locate the fund at the univer- 
sity, the corporate authorities of Knoxville had voted $15,000 to erect 
a library building. This building was never erected. The university 
finally brought suit against the city and obtained judgment for princi- 
pal and interest, amounting to $20,000. Since that time interest has 
been paid annually on this sum for the benefit of the library. When 
President Humes made his first report, mentioned above, in October, 
1869, the library contaified only 1,000 volumes. The number has been 
increased to nearly 6,000. Each of the two literary societies also has a 
library. 
In the, new organization, as has already been indicated, two prepara- 
tory schools were established in connection with the university—one 
classical and the other English. Principal Butler conducted the classi- 
cal school in the old “White House,” situated on the university 
grounds, where Agricultural Hall now stands. The English school was 
taught at the old Hampden-Sidney Academy, on Church street, in the 
city. It was intended to dispense with all preparatory work as soon as 
the educational condition of the State would justify such a policy. 
However, the time was slow to arrive. The preparatory did much 
good, though always more or less, a disturbing element. Mistakes 
were oftener made in curtailing it than in giving it greater scope and 
efficiency. The great lack of efficient preparatory schools throughout 
the State has made some preparatory work necessary even to the pres- 
ent time, though a regular class is not now maintained. 
At first very few appointments for free scholarships were made 
under the new law. In October of the first term only four young men 
had availed themselves of this provision. Yet within one or two years 
a large per cent entered on “free scholarships,” and finally but little 
tuition was paid by those living in the State. For the first two years 
of the new school the principal railroads of the State returned “ ap- 
pointees” to their homes free. Afterwards, for some years, appointees 
were passed free both ways, twice a year, by all railways in the State. 
The favor was then restricted to the indigent, and finally was dropped 
altogether. 
In the fall of 1869 tuition was set at $15 for five months in all classes 
except the lowest preparatory students, who paid $12.50. Room rent 
was $5 per year, and the incidental fee the same. Coal could be had

at 22 cents per bushel. The expense of a year’s residence at the uni- 
versity ranged between $150 and $200. Those needing it could get 
assistance in the way of remunerative employment. Arrangements 
had been made to accommodate 300 students. By the end of the year 
183 had been enrolled. 
For some years after the settlement of the agricultural land grant 
the management of the university labored under a great. embarrassment 
from a failure of the State to pay the interest on the fund as it came 
due. It was necessary to borrow money and also to sell State warrants 
atadiscount. Yet, in spite of obstacles, the school was kept running 
by the president and the trustees. 
With the exception of short periods already mentioned, between 1843 
and 1860, the military feature had been lacking in the school. The 
agricultural land-grant act, as previously stated, required military tac- 
ties to be taught. At first the Government failed to provide any officer 
to take charge of this department. In the spring of 1870 a provisional 
organization was effected by Maj. Hunter Nicholson, who was then pro- 
fessor of agriculture and horticulture. As there was no regular pro- 
vision for this department, little was done beyond some simple tactic 
exercises. A company was organized, with Landon H. Charles, of 
Hawkins County, as its first captain. Ina short time Capt. Charles 
withdrew from school, and First Lieut, P. M. Liles, of Anderson County, 
was promoted to fill the vacancy. A military suit similar to those of 
West Point and Cornell University was adopted. The coat was a sin- 
gle-breasted frock of cadet gray; pantaloons were of same material, 
with a dark-blue stripe down thelegs. The hat was of the Army pat- 
tern, with a wreath in front, encircling the letters “E. T. U.C.” inmon- 
ogram. All buttons were stamped with the American eagle, having 
“HE. T. U.” above and “ University” below. Officers’ straps were of 
the regular Army pattern. The next fall Capt. A. S. Marriner, an ex- 
Army officer, then resident of Knoxville, was secured to conduct the 
military drills. About this time the State placed about 100 stand of 
arms, with equipments, at the disposal of the university. The Govern- 
ment delayed to send aregular Army officer until December, 1871, when 
Lieut. Thomas T. Thornburgh was installed as commandant of cadets. 
The whole institution was then put under regular West Point: disci- 
pline. This lasted till the fall of 1890, when all military control was 
abandoned, tactics only being retained. 
The attitude of the new management towards religion may be indi- 
cated by an extract from the catalogue of 1869-70, which says: “The 
institution is not sectarian, as regards religion, but it is intended to 
exert a decided Christian influence upon the students, and to cultivate 
among them a healthy moral tone.” Through the entire history of the 
institution it has been the same. Students have always been required 
to attend church and Sunday school regularly. 
Tn 1870 Prof. Grace left and his place was filled by Prof. Kirkpatrick,

who was changed from the chair of Latin. Principals Butler and Brad- 
ford also left and were succeeded by Charles 8. Newman, who now 
became principal of the two preparatory departments, which were com- 
bined and taught at the old “White House on the Hill.” Prof, Allen 
having returned from Europe to resume his chair of Latin and Greek, 
Instructor Beckwith resigned. Prof. Gustavus R. Knabe was made 
instructor in singing and F’. H. Hacker instructor in drawing. 
The class of 1871 was the first to graduate after the war. It con- 
sisted of 4 members, as follows: S. A. Craig, T. C. Karns, Albert Set- 
zepfand, and J, W. C. Willoughby. Willoughby had the valedictory 
and Karns the Latin salutatory. 8. A. Craig received ane degree of 
bachelor of science, and the rest bachelor of arts. 
A mechanical course was now substituted for the scientific, so that 
the courses then stood, agricultural, mechanical, and classical, A fourth 
course, called scientific, was added. It was identical with the classical, 
except that Greek was supplanted by certain studies of the agricul-— 
tural and mechanical courses. Two shorter courses of two years each, 
one in agriculture and the other in mechanics, were established this 
year for the benefit of young men who were advanced in years and had 
limited means and time. A certificate only was granted for the com- 
pletion of these. The preparatory still embraced three years for clas- 
sical and two years for nonclassical students, The summer catalogue 
made a call for contributions of, forest and field products. for the 
museum, 
Prof. Atwater returned from Europe in the fall with a supply of 
improved apparatus for the chemical laboratory, after having studied 
two years and visited various schools and colleges to gather informa- 
tion for his department. Albert Ruth, A. M., and Levi Van Fossen, 
PH. B., were appointed instructors in the preparatory department. As 
has already been mentioned, Lieut, T. T, Thornburgh, ‘of the U.S. 
Army, in December 1871, became professor of military science and com- 
mandant of cadets. 
In the latter part of 1871 the farm was surveyed and laid off in fields 
preparatory to beginning rotation of crops. In 1872 crops were planted 
and much preparatory work was done. Stock was purchased, a barn 
built, and as much as possible effected for the teaching of practical 
agriculture.. Several students made half their board by work on the 
farm. 
During the year 1871-72 the number of students nearly doubled, 
reaching 228. Of these 108 were State appointees. Sixty-five were in 
the regular college classes, 13 in the two shorter scientific courses, and 
150 in the preparatory department. Five graduated in June, 1872—one 
as bachelor of science and four as bachelors of arts. 
The Latin-scientific course and the two shorter scientific courses were 
discontinued in 1872. Students, or their parents for them, were allowed. 
to choose one of the other courses, but without further latitude in the
-P-A-G-E-88

selection of studies, unless select studies only should be taken. One 
year was added to the nonclassical preparatory course, making it three 
years, or equal in time to the classical course. A collection of about 
700 models was obtained from the Patent Office at Washington, in 
February, 1872, for the use of the mechanical department. Though the 
two-year courses had been dropped, special studies were still allowed 
to young men 18 years of age. Postgraduate studies were also 
announced for the first time. The fee charged for degrees was $6.50. 
The cabinet of geology, mineralogy, and zodlogy was growing rapidly, 
and the large private collections of Prof. Frank H. Bradley were 
placed at the service of classes. 
Early in 1872 the Secretary of War intrusted to the university 200 
cadet breech-loading muskets, 2 light 12-pound field pieces, and a 
supply of side arms for officers. 
Instructor Van Fossen, of the preparatory department, resigned in 
1872, and Rey. Thomas Roberts, M. A., was appointed to the vacancy. 
F. E. Hacker resigned as instructor in drawing. Charles Waring, 
©. E., of the University of Dublin, was appointed to the same position, 
but does not seem to have served. 
During the summer of 1872 the capacity of the college for lodging 
and instruction was largely increased by the erection of a new dormi- 
tory three stories high and 100 feet long. It was located on the east 
side of the campus, and is now called “South College.” The grounds 
were also greatly improved by grading, planting trees, ete. 
During 1872-73 there was again a great increase in the number of 
students, the total reaching 271. To supply the demand for teachers 
and encourage public school education a course for teachers was pre- 
sented in the fall of 1873, It embraced studies for three years. Every 
applicant was required to bring a certificate from his county superin- 
tendent and declare his intention to teach in the State at least two 
years. The entrance age was 18. 
Notwithstanding the great increase in number of students, expecta- 
tion seems not to have been satisfied, and in his biennial report to the 
legislature in January, 1873, we find President Humes pointing out 
obstacles to the widely extended usefulness of the institution, He 
Says: 
The low condition of education in the State, entailed by the late war, has inter- 
fered seriously with the widely extended usefulness of the college. As will be seen 
from previous statements in this report, comparatively few of the students have 
been able to enter even the freshman class. The large majority need more or less 
of previous training. Many of them, having lost years of education, are impatient 
of time, and eager, upon the acquisition of a little learning, to begin the active life 
of acitizen. Others, of smaller capacity, can not properly overcome the want of 
earlier instruction and mental training. These find study too irksome, fail in hopeful 
application, and soon conclude to leave the schoolroom for easier fields of labor. 
Others still, whose pecuniary means are small, are constrained to think that “the 
pursuit of knowledge under difficulties,” however commendable in the abstract, is 
too painful for their power of perseverance,

He also speaks of the lack of proper estimate of education and the 
intense desire of pecuniary gain among the people as the “‘two serious 
difficulties in the way of good college work in this region of country.” 
Much of the trouble he very justly stibntd to the recent war. 
In 1873 several changes in the faculty occurred. Prof. F. D. Allen 
resigned the chair of Latin and Greek and his place was filled by Mor- 
ton William Easton, PH.D. Rev. F. Jsperandieu was made professor 
of French in place of Prof. I. B. Barker, who resigned the chair of 
French and German. Prof. Atwater vacated the chair of general and 
agricultural chemistry and was succeeded by Prof. B. S. Burton, PH. B. 
Lieut. Thornburgh having been recalled to the Army, Col. 8. B. Craw- 
ford was elected professor of military science and commandant of cadets. 
A special chair of rhetoric and elocution was created and then filled by 
Rey. Thomas C. Teasdale, D.D. He brought a large number of students 
from Mississippi where he had lived and had extensive acquaintance. ~ 
‘The president took evidences of religion instead of mental science, which 
was given to Prof. Kirkpatrick. ©. 8. Newman resigned as principal 
of the preparatory department, and his place was filled by the pro- 
motion of Instructor A. Ruth. Spurrier Howard-Smith, A. B., Eben 
Alexander, A. B., and William B. Payne, .B., were elected tutors. L.W. 
Philson, A. M., and A. L. Wakefield, B. A., B. S., were elected instructors 
in the preparatory department. The additions to the faculty were 
necessitated by the increased attendance of students. Prof. Frank H. 
Bradley resigned the chair of mineralogy and geology in 1874. This 
chair was then merged with chemistry. : 
In this year great improvement was also made in the buildings of 
the institution. The large dining hall on the west border of the grounds 
was erected. It was three stories high, the first story being designed 
for the steward’s family, the middle story for the students’ tables, 
and the upper story as private rooms for students or faculty. A house 
for the superintendent was also built on the farm. North College, 
which had formerly been only a family residence, was, in the year fol- 
lowing, much enlarged. The basement was fitted up for the chemical 
laboratory, while students’ rooms were arranged in the upper stories. 
The chemical laboratory was thus much enlarged. <A lecture room, a 
balance room, and a furnace room were secured and everything put in 
shape for the highest grade of work. 
The attendance during 1873-74 reached 318, of whom 211 were State 
appointees. This is the highest ity. Fifty. of the academic depart-   
ment in the history of the university. Fifty-two counties were repre- 
sented by appointees. Forty counties were unrepresented. It was 
complained that, while a majority of the students were farmers’ sons, 
they more frequently chose some oe course of study than that of 
agriculture. At the end of the year seven bachelor’s degrees and one 
master’s degree were conferred. 
The management of the farm for ee by the trustees was ‘con-
-P-A-G-E-94

servative. ‘ Doubtful experiments” were avoided. The policy seemed 
to be to present the best methods already known. At the same time 
the farm committee turned over to the professor of agriculture a cer- 
tain tract of ground for the special purpose of scientific experiments. 
In this connection Prof. Nicholson, who was in charge, says: 
Experiments are of two kinds. (1) Those instituted for original investigation to 
discover some unknown law or fact; (2) educational, or such as are designed to 
illustrate and teach laws and facts already known. Original experiments are in 
their nature expensive and can only be carried on by a few men of science in their 
laboratories or at experiment stations. In these experiments it is not possible for 
the Tennessee Agricultural College to engage at present, simply because it has not 
the necessary funds. Educational experiments are within the scope and means of 
every agricultural college. They have a definite purpose and are eminently prac- 
tical and are not necessarily costly. Many such might be conducted by students of 
the higher college classes, under advice of professors in charge, and be made 
instructive both to students and the public at large. 
A notion prevailed among some persons that it had been the inten- 
tion of the Congressional endowment act to establish manual labor 
schools in the various States. In reference to this Prof. Nicholsan 
says: 
The subject of labor is in no wise referred to in that act. The law of this State 
does require some labor of the students of the Tennessee Agricultural College, 
though it does not prescribe the amount, and this requirement has been complied 
with, as far as seemed practicable. But manual labor is not made a prominent 
feature of this college, nor can it be without serious detriment to its real inter- 
ests. * * * Repeated experiments in various parts of the Union, running 
‘through forty years, go to prove by their failures that this opinion is true. 
He further shows that the successful study of scientific agriculture is 
based upon a knowledge of the physical sciences and that the student 
is not prepared to specialize in agriculture till the last years of his 
course; 
In June, 1875, Col. Crawford resigned as professor of military science 
and commandant of cadets and was succeeded by Lieut. A. H. Nave, 
of the U.S. Army. W.B. Payne and A. L. Wakefield resigned posi- 
tions as instructors in the preparatory department and their places were 
filled by S. B. Crawford, A. B., and T. ©. Karns, 4. B. The first post 
graduate students (David H. Ludlow and W. B. Ragsdale) are reported 
in the catalogue of 1875-76. Lewis M. Herring was appointed in- 
structor in chemistry in 1876. Lieut. J. E. Bloom, of the U. S. Army, 
was professor of military science and commandant of cadets in 1876-77. 
A theoretical branch of military instruction was introduced in 1877, 
consisting of lectures and recitations in junior and senior classes. The 
attendance in 1874-75 was 315, showing a decline of but 3. In 1875-76 
it dropped to 300 and in 1876-77 there was a further decline to 288. 
In the summer of 1877 the entire faculty was reorganized. It then 
stood for the following year as given below: 
Rey. Thomas W. Humes, 8. 1. D., president and professor of ethics and 
evidences of religion.

Ww. E. Moses, assistant in analytical chemistry. 
Lieut. Geo. W. Baxter, of the U. 8. A., was elected professor of mili- 
tary science and commandant of cadets, and served for a short time in 
the fall of 1877, but soon resigned, and was succeeded by Col. 8. H. 
Lockett. 
In the same year the trustees made separate colleges of the three old 
courses of study—the agricultural, the mechanical, and the classical. 
They were now to be known as the College of Agriculture, the College 
of Engineering and Mechanic Arts, and the Classical College, each 
having its corps of instructors and separate curriculum. Ail were of 
equal rank, but under one government. The catalogue at this time 
shows a still farther drawing away from the old classical education and 
the formulation of a new basisin science. This process had been work- 
ing slowly from the establishment of the Agricultural College in 1869, 
In 1878 Prof, Kirkpatrick was changed from the chair of logic and 
English literature to a new chair of history and philosophy, and 
Edward 8. Joynes, A. M., LL. D., late of Vanderbilt University, was 
made professor of English language and belles-lettres. 
While there was a falling off of attendance as a whole at this time, 
statistics show that the number of students in the collegiate depart- 
ment was largely increasing, as compared with those in the preparatory. 
The attendance was also greater as compared with recent years than 
in most of the Virginia colleges. However, the number of State 
appointees was perceptibly reduced. Some falling off was attributed 
to the recent establishment of Vanderbilt University at Nashville. In 
the early part of 1879 a chair of practical agriculture was estab- 
lished but never filled. In order to afford students an opportunity to 
enter in accordance with their advancement in various studies without 
being subjected to a close curriculum, and to give greater opportunity 
for optional studies, the extreme istive system of organization was 
now adopted. The existing colleges were divided into schools, each 
under charge of its own professor. A student entered each school 
according to his advancement there, and with little reference to what    
-P-A-G-E-96
    
80 HIGHER EDUCATION. IN TENNESSEE. 
he might be doing in other schools, except that classes were correlated 
by a fixed schedule of recitation hours. To give an idea of the pro- 
gression of studies and methods of instruction at this time, the follow- 
ing remarks appended to the course in agriculture are quoted: 
The purely scientific studies in the above course are arranged with systematic 
progression. A knowledge of the freshman-class studies is essential to the successful 
study of those of thesophomore class. Soin turn a knowledge of the studies of each of 
the preceding years is requisite to an appreciation of the lectures of the senior class. 
In the first two years the studies mainly concern elements and principles; in the last 
two these elements and principles are applied to real life. The method adopted in 
lecturing is as follows: The topics of the lecture are placed on the blackboard before 
the class comes into the room. | These head notes are copied by the class; the pro- 
fessor then discusses the topics and illustrates them on the board when necessary. 
At the next meeting of the class each student is required to hand in a written report 
-of the lecture of the preceding meeting. These reports are looked over and cor- 
rected by the professor during the intervals between the meetings. 
On March 10, 1879, the legislature passed an act changing the name 
of the institution from “Hast Tennessee University” to “ University of 
Tennessee.” President Humes, in his report to the legislature of 1881, 
speaking of the matter, says: “ By this act the university becomes fully 
a State institution. Heretofore the State Agricultural College had been 
part of the East Tennessee University. Now the whole institution 
receives the name of the State and becomes in the fullest sense by law 
the State university.” 
Another act, passed March 24, 1879, provided— 
That no further vacancies shall be filled in the board of trustees until the number 
thereof is reduced by death, resignation, or otherwise below 30, and that in filling 
vacancies thereafter up to the number of 30 preference shall be given to Congres- 
sional districts not represented in the board until each Congressional district shall 
have at least one representative on the board of trustees. 
The same act also provided that a board of visitors—three from each 
of the three divisions of the State—should be appointed by the gov- 
ernor, holding their office four years, whose duty it should be to visit 
the university at least once a year and make a report thereon to the 
governor. Their expenses were to be paid out of the university contin- 
gent fund, but no compensation was allowed. 
A third act was passed at the same date to provide a better system 
of appointing cadets in the university. This required the State super- 
intendent of public instruction, in May of each year, to notify city and 
county superintendents, after giving a notice of ten days, to hold, in 
the month of June, examinations for candidates for scholarships. It 
was made the city or county superintendent’s further duty, within ten 
days, to return a list of qualified candidates in order of merit to the 
State superintendent. It was then made the State superintendent’s 
duty to communicate the list to the senators or representatives, with 
the number of vacancies existing at the university, and the said sena- 
tors or representatives were then to make their appointments and com- 
Inunicate the same to the State superintendent, who in turn was to send

On “Commencement Day,” June 18, 1879, “The University of Ten- 
nessee” was inaugurated in pursuance of the law of March 16, chang- 
ing the name from “Hast Tennessee University.” In compliance with 
the act establishing a board of visitors, the governor, Albert 8S. Marks, 
* appointed the following: Ex- “governor James D. Porter, Paris; Hon. 
J. Harvey Mathes, Memphis; Gen. R.. |P Neely, Bolivar; Hon. John C. 
Gaut, Nashville; Gen. Lucius E. Polk, Columbia; Hon. a. W. Ewing, 
Pulaski; Perez Dicking on, esq., Knoxville; Hon. James T. Shields, 
Bean Station, and Dr. E. M. Wight, Chattanooga, ex-Governor Porter 
being made president of the board. These were installed into office in 
connection with the inauguration serene The inaugural address 
was delivered by Dr. Humes, president of the university. The instal- 
lation address was delivered by Gov. Marks, and the response on the 
part of the board of visitors was made by Hon. Z. W. Ewing. In the 
conclusion of his address, Mr. Ewing said: 
We congratulate you, sir, the officials, faculty, and students of the university, and 
all of our fellow-citizens, upon their now having within their borders an institution 
of learning that is their peculiar property, and that bids fair to be to our Common- 
wealth what the University of Edinburghis to Scotland, Oxford to England, and the 
University of Virginia is to that State. 
During this commencement an address embracing the early history 
of the university was delivered before the alumni by Moses White, 
esq., of the class of 1850, and a poem was recited by Rev. Joseph H. 
Martin, D. D., of the class of 1843. 
MEDICAL AND DENTAL DEPARTMENTS.   
About this time arrangements were made by which the Nashville 
Medical College, located at the city of Nashville, was incorporated with

the university, under the title of Medical Department of the Univer- 
sity of Tennessee. A dental department was included in the medical 
school. The president of the university became president of the 
medical department alsc, and conferred the medical degrees in the 
name of the university. The connection otherwise was very slight. 
It was hoped that mutual good would reSult to the two institutions 
from the union. The medical school, as an independent institution, 
had been in successful operation for some years. At the time of the 
union, George S. Blackie, M.D. (idin.), PH. D., was president of the 
medical faculty, and Duncan Eve, M. D., dean. Now (1891) the faculty 
for both medical and dental departments is as follows: 
Charles W. Dabney, jr., PH. D., LL. D., president of the university. 
Hon. William P. Jones, M. D., president of the faculty. 
Dunean Eve, M. D., A. M., dean of the faculty and professor of the prac- 
tice of surgery. 
John 8. Cain, M. D., professor of the principles and practice of medicine, 
with clinical medicine and general pathology. 
J. Berrien Lindsley, D. D., M. D., professor of medical chemistry and 
State medicine. 
J. Bunyan Stephens, M. D., professor of obstetrics and clinical midwifery. 
William D. Haggard, . D., professor of gynecology and diseases of chil- 
dren, : 
W. M. Vertrees, M. D., professor of materia medica and therapeutics. 
Paul I’. Eve, M. D., professor of the principles of surgery, operative and 
clinical surgery. 
William E.McCampbell, A. M., M.D., professor of general, descriptive, and 
surgical anatomy. 
John A. Witherspoon, M. D., professor of practice of medicine and medi- 
cal hygiene. 
T. Hilliard Wood, M. D., professor of physiology. 
William I’. Glenn, M. D., professor of venereal diseases. 
John G. Sinclair, M. D., professor of clinical diseases of the eye, ear, and 
throat. 
William G. Brien, M. D., LL. D., professor of medical jurisprudence. 
J. H. Blanks, M. D., professor of clinical medicine. 
Haley P. Cartwright, M. D., professor of physical diagnosis. 
Charles Mitchell, M. D., professor of microscopy and histology. 
James W. Handly, M. D., professor of genito-urinary diseases and demon- 
strator of anatomy. 
Ross Dunn, M. D., demonstrator of anatomy. 
The course of medical instruction consists of “didactic lectures, with 
demonstrations, clinical teaching, examinations or quizzes, and practi- 
eal teaching in subjects involving manipulation.” The candidate for 
graduation must be 21 years of age, of good moral character, and must 
have studied at least two years. The first year may be passed at some

other reputable college. A graded course of three years is also pro- 
vided, but it is not obligatory. 
The school is located on Broad street and has one of the best equipped. 
buildings in the country. A free city dispensary is located on the 
ground floor. The fees are: Matriculation, $5; lectures, $75; demon- 
strator’s fee, $10; graduation fee, $25. 
The dental course of study embraces “operative, prosthetic, and clin- 
ical dentistry, lectures on oral and clinical surgery, chemistry, materia 
medica, and therapeutics, regional anatomy, physiology, and micro- 
scopy.” The requirements for graduation and the fees are similar to 
those of the medical department. 
DEGREES IN 1879. 
Returning to our account of the literary department or university 
proper, at Knoxville, we notice that the degrees conferred in 1879 were 
divided into collegiate, postgraduate, and professional. The collegi- 
ate degrees were bachelor of arts and bachelor of science. The first was 
given in the classical college and included full courses of study in 
Latin, Greek, English, history, and philosophy; and partial courses in 
mathematics, chemistry, natural history, and modern languages. The 
second was given in the mechanical college and in the agricultural col- 
lege. In the former it included full courses of study in mathematics, 
applied mathematics, chemistry, natural history, and partial courses 
in English, history and philosophy, and modern languages. In the 
latter fall courses in chemistry (including agricultural chemistry), 
natural history, agriculture; and partial courses in mathematics, ap- 
plied mathematics, English, history and philosophy, and modern lan- 
guages. Students could take Latin for equivalent literary studies in 
the degree of bachelor of science, if approved by the faculty. 
The postgraduate degrees were master of arts and doctor of philos- 
ophy. The master’s degree had hitherto been given in course to grad- 
uates of three years’ standing who had sustained a good moral chav- 
acter and would present to the faculty a satisfactory original thesis. 
Instead, now, one year of resident postgraduate study was required. 
Doctor of philosophy required two years of resident postgraduate study 
under direction of the faculty. 
The professional degrees were civil engineer and doctor of medicine. 
The former required two years of special study. A teacher’s certificate 
was given to those who properly completed the normal course. Only 
students 18 years of age could take elective studies exclusively. The 
cost of a residence of one year at the university was now placed at $150. 
In 1879 the first year of the preparatory course was cut off, leaving - 
only two years. Applicants must now be 15 years of age and able to 
pass in common school studies, and Latin also when there is a desire 
to enter the classical department.

CHANGES. 
In the summer of 1879 some changes in the faculty were made. The 
chair of agriculture and horticulture, occupied by Prof. Hunter Nich- 
olson, had included also botany natural history, and geology. In 
order to give greater scope for instruction in these fundamental 
branches the chair was divided and two new chairs created—the chair 
of natural history and geology and that of agriculture and horticul- 
ture, including botany. Prof. Nicholson was assigned to the former and 
Prof. John M. McBryde, of Virginia, to the latter. Col. 8. B. Crawford 
was made professor of military science and commandant of cadets, Col. 
Lockett having resigned. David B. Johnson, B.A., was also made 
assistant instructor in mathematics. 
~In July, 1879, a great loss was sustained by the university in the 
death of Prof. R. L. Kirkpatrick, of the department of history and phi- 
losophy. The president in his next report to the legislature tells how 
Prof. Kirkpatrick had for more than thirty years been connected with 
the university in “the several relations of student, instructor, and pro- 
fessor, and by his eminent ability and character, his experience and 
prudence in counsel, and his assiduous devotion to duty, had greatly 
added to the usefulness and prosperity of the university. His death is 
deeply mourned by the trustees, by his colleagues in the faculty, and 
by the entire community.” 
Prof. W. G. Bro wn, of the chair of general and agricultural chemis- 
try, was granted leave of absence in June, 1880, for one year to study 
his profession in the universities of Germany. Assistant Prof. W. 
E. Moses filled the chair during the absence of his principal, and Mr. 
Maury Nicholson, B. 8., was appointed assistant instructor. At the 
same time Prof. M. W. Easton resigned the chair of modern languages 
and comparative philology to accept a call to the University of Penn- 
sylvania, at Philadelphia. By this resignation and the death of Prof. 
Kirkpatrick two leading literary chairs were left vacant. The board 
availed themselves of this opportunity to make some changes. The 
chair of history and philosophy was assigned to the president. Mod- 
ern languages went to the professor of English and belles-lettres. The 
expense of one professorship was thus saved to be applied to the new 
chair of pure mathematics, which came from a division of mathematics 
into pure and applied. The instructorship in mathematics was dropped. 
Prof. Lockett was retained in the department of applied mathematics, 
and the new chair of pure mathematics was filled by James Dinwiddie, 
M.A.,late profes sor in Southwestern Presbyterian University at Clarks- 
ville. 
In 1880 a surveyor’s course of two years, a practical agriculture 
course of two years, and a bus iness course of one year were established. 
For the completion of each of these, as well as the normal course, a 
certificate was granted. 
Upon the course of practical agriculture, yet somewhat different from 
it, was founded a system of agricultural apprenticeships, combining

alternate days of class-room instruction and renumerative farm work. 
The student’s labor was paid for according to a fixed scale of prices. 
He was thus enabled to make his way at college, and at the same time 
gain valuable knowledge in the practical details of scientific farming. 
All candidates for degrees were now required to attend a course of 
lectures relating to agriculture and the mechanic arts. The prepara- 
tory school was reduced to one year of subcollegiate work, 
SUMMER NORMAL. 
Mainly through the efforts of Mr. Frank M. Smith, superintendent 
of public instruction for Knox County, a State normal institute was 
established at the university during the summer of 1880. The session 
lasted six weeks. Tuition was free. The expense of the school was 
borne by the trustees of the Peabody fund for education in the South- 
west. The university trustees and the city of Knoxville also aided at 
various times. The teaching force was made up of selections from the 
university faculty and other experienced teachers. This school con- 
tinued every summer till 1884, when the Peabody fund was withdrawn. 
The success of the summer normal varied with different years. More 
than 200 teachers from all parts of the State attended in 1881. In 
1884 over 300 were in attendance. For a while the course of study 
embraced three years’ work. Through the State board of education 
diplomas were conferred. Those who had completed the first year . 
received certificates to teach, good for one year. Those who went also 
through the second year had certificates for two years, and those who 
completed the three years had diplomas for life and were not Seer 
to further examination by the public school authorities. 
DISTINCTIONS AND HONORS. 
The university now established distinctions in scholarship. Students 
who reached a grade of 80 per cent were considered “ distinguished.” 
Graduates with this grade were “honor graduates.” “ Certificates of 
distinction” were given to all students who reached the fixed grade on 
all their studies for the year. Certificates of distinguished proficiency 
were also conferred upon those who attained a “grade of distinction 
upon the average of any course required for a certificate of proficiency.” 
These distinctions were announced publicly at commencement and also 
published in the catalogue. Scholarships to a limited number, with 
exemption from all university fees, were also established for students 
of the highest standing in a complete course. Somewhat later, addi- 
tional scholarships were given in associated schools that were prepar- 
ing students for the university. 
FARM EXPERIMENTS. 
In 1880 Prof. McBryde secured the erection of the new agricultural 
hall, located on the east side of University Hill. On the first floor was
-P-A-G-E-102
  86 ; HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE. 
the professor’s lecture room and laboratory; above was the agricultural 
mnuseum. <A greenhouse and a propagating house were built just west 
of the agricultural hall. 
In 1879 Prof. McBryde undertook a number of farm experiments of 
such practical character as seeding, mode of culture, fertilizing, cattle 
feeding, ensilage, ete. Later areport of results was made and distrib- 
uted to the farmers of the State. The experimental farm was put in a 
high state of efficiency. New building, implements, machinery, silos, 
apple and peach orchards, fruit gardens of plums, apricots, cherries, 
quinces, raspberries, strawberries, gooseberries, currants, ete., were 
provided; also a nursery of 5,000 ornamental trees and shrubs, The 
professor of agriculture sought to make the farm to his department 
what the laboratory is to the chemist. 
In 1881 an arrangement was made with the Knoxville Business Col- 
lege by which its professors (J. W. Jones and J. F. Jones) would con- 
duct the business department at the university. Separate fees were 
charged to students who took the business course. 
In 1882 Prof. Joynes resigned his chair of English and modern 
languages. Prof. Rodes Massie, of Virginia, was elected to the 
vacancy. The chair of agriculture and horticulture was also vacated 
by the resignation of Prof. McBryde. His successor was Prof. John 
W. Glenn, of Georgia. As has been stated, Prof. W. E. Moses filled 
the chair of chemistry while Prof. Brown was absent in Europe during 
1881-82. At the end of that time Mr. Moses was made adjunct pro- 
fessor of chemistry. 
EXPERIMENT STATION. 
In order to extend the usefulness of the agricultural department, the 
board of trustees on June 8, 1882, established on the college farm an 
experiment station. A board of control, composed of university trus- 
tees, was appointed to manage the station. Prof. John W. Glenn was 
made director. The work of the station was to be separate from the 
regular business of the farm. The station management was to hold 
itself ready to make, without charge, at any time, for citizens of the 
State, analyses of seeds, soils, fertilizers, and minerals when there was 
a prospect that such analysis would result in public good. This sta- 
tion was one of the first five in the United States. The State legisla. 
ture, in 1883, passed an act providing for the analysis and inspection 
of commercial fertilizers and devoted a portion of the tax assessed to 
supporting the station. The analyses were to be made by the station 
in return for its share of the tax. This amounted to no more than 
$700 to $1,000 per annum. There was little else available to carry on 
the work. Yet many valuable results were obtained. Three reports 
of 150 to 200 pages each were published and distributed to the farmers 
of the State. Prof. W. A. Noyes was station chemist from 1883 to 
1886. He was succeeded by Prof. W. E, Moses, who served till 1888.

THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE. 87 
DR. HUMES RESIGNS. 
In 1883 Dr. Humes gave up the presidency and retired to private 
life. He had occupied the position with great credit to himself and 
profit to the university for eighteen years. The board decided not to 
fill the vacancy at present, and authorized the faculty to elect a chair- 
man, who should perform the duties of president. Thereupon Prof. 
Rodes Massie was elected to the position. At the same time Col. 
Lockett resigned the chair of applied mathematics. The work of the 
chair was assigned to Prof. Dinwiddie, who had pure mathematics, and 
Mr. Lewis C. Carter was elected instructor in applied mathematics. 
Prof. Brown had also resigned the chair of chemistry and mineralogy. 
Prof. W. A. Noyes was chosen to fill the vacancy. Col. Crawford, who 
had formerly been commandant of cadets and instructor in mathematics 
and military science, was now made professor of military science, com- 
mandant of cadets, and adjunct professor of mathematics. Thomas O. 
Deaderick was raised from instructor in ancient languages to adjunct 
professor of the same. John N. Bogart was elected instructor of sub- 
collegiate classes, and William I. Thomas instructor in modern 
languages and natural history. Another year was added to sub- 
collegiate instruction, making a course of two years. 
Prof. Dinwiddie ea his chair of mathematics in the summer of 
1885. The place was filled by the election of Prof. W. W. Carson, a 
graduate of Washington and Lee University. 
Prof. E, Alexander served as chairman of the faculty during the col- 
legiate year of 1885-86 and at the end of that time resigned his profes- 
sorship in the university to accept a similar place in the University of 
North Carolina, Adjunct Prof. Thomas OQ. Deaderick was promoted 
to fill the vacancy. 
Prof. Noyes at the same time resigned the chair of chemistry and 
mineralogy to accept a position in Rose Polytechnic Institute at Terre 
Haute, Ind. Adjunct Prof. W. E. Moses was promoted to the vacancy. 
The preparatory course was now agam reduced to one year. The 
vacillating policy regarding this department has been detrimental 
throughout the history of the university. Frequent changes were also 
mae in the collegiate courses, so that it is almost impossible to trace 
all of them. There was now a greater tendency to concentrate, and 
students were allowed less liberty in selecting studies. 
Col. S. B. Crawford was made chairman of the faculty for 1886-87. 
Price Thomas, A. M., was chosen instructor in natural history, agricul- 
ture, etc.; Charles Walker, A. M., instructor in chemistry and physics, 
and T. ©. Karns, A. M., principal of the preparatory department. 
During the entire history of the agricultural college, public com- 
plaints have been made that so few students entered its course of study. 
The authorities sought in various ways to remedy the trouble, which 
seemed to be fundamental in society rather than in the university man-

agement. Farmers’ sons especially were disposed to take other courses 
of study and escape the farm life to which they had been brought up. 
Tn 1886 the trustees and faculty tried a heroic remedy. All the agri- 
cultural and mechanical courses were broadened and extended, while 
into every other course, except that of engineering, were introduced 
“at least five leading studies directly relating to agriculture, besides 
many others less directly bearing on it.” In this way provision was 
made that no graduate of the institution, except from the engineering 
department, could escape having a fairly good agricultural education. 
SHOP WORK. 
At this time the feature of practical work in the shop was also intro- 
duced. There had been no lack of theoretical instruction in this line, 
but want of funds and practical leadership had hitherto retarded the 
real work of the shop. The management now began to feel that the 
school should be brought more distinctively within the scope intended 
by the Congressional act of endowment. There had been the same 
difficulty here that was encountered by corresponding schools in other 
States. The principles and practice involved were radically different 
from the system of education hitherto prevailing. Consequently teach- 
ers with the peculiar training required were scarce. They had to be 
produced to meet the new demand. All this took time, Hence we 
find the development of the agricultural and mechanical school a mat- 
ter of slow growth. Such a shop as was desired, providing facility for 
all kinds of work in wood and metal, could not be afforded. Soa 
small sum only was expended for a plain building, equipped with simple 
machinery for working in wood. This new enterprise was under the 
advisory control of Prof. W. W. Carson, of the chair of mathematics, 
but in the direct charge of Mr. L.C. Carter, instructor in applied mathe- 
matics. Mr. Carter was a young man of decided taste in this branch 
of work, and in order to qualify himself more thoroughly spent several 
months of the summer and fall of 1886 at Purdue University, where 
the opportunities were especially good. The shop was opened late in 
the season, and at once became a popular feature with many students. 
By slow degrees the classical feature was disappearing from the uni- 
versity, while scientific and industrial education took its place. 
Early in 1887 the board of trustees, recognizing the need of a perma- 
nent and directly responsible executive officer, elected Dr. John M. 
McBryde president. Dr. McBryde had formerly been very successful 
and popular as professor of agriculture in the institution and was now 
president of South Carolina College, at Columbia. He accepted the 
new position and was expected to take charge at an early day, but 
suddenly changed his mind and resigned. 
NEW PRESIDENT. 
At this juncture the board were fortunate in securing Dr. Charles 
W. Dabney, jr., State chemist of North Carolina and director of the
-P-A-G-E-109
THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE. 89 
North Carolina Agricultural Experiment Station. He agreed to accept 
the presidency on condition that he should have full power in direct- 
ing, controlling, and shaping the policy of the institution. To this the 
board readily agreed, and the new president entered upon his duties 
early in August. 
Dr. Dabney is a native of Virginia—the son of Dr. Robert L. Dab- 
ney—and descended from an old Huguenot family—the D’Aubignés. 
He graduated at Hampden-Sidney College and also at the University 
of Virginia. He was then professor in Emory and Henry College, and 
afterwards went to Germany, where he took the degree of doctor of 
philosophy at Géttingen. Davidson College conferred upon him the 
degree of doctor of laws in 1889. He had held several important posi- 
tions in his adopted State—North Carolina—where he was a member of 
a commission to visit the industrial schools of the country and propose 
plans for a technical college in that State. Dr. Dabney brought to his 
new field of work a full, vigorous manhood and broad culture; a bold 
business adaptability, and an eager desire to put into practice his 
ideas of technical education. Henceforth “industrial” education is the 
watchword—not the training of farm laborers or the teaching of a trade, 
but the thorough education of young men in the principles and prac- 
tice of industrial science, so they may go out into the world to be mas- 
ters or directors of industry in the field, the shop, and the mine. 
Before Dr. Dabney’s accession, Clifford L. Newman, B. 8., of the Ala- 
bama Agricultural College, had been elected assistant professor of agri- 
culture and natural history. S. N. Smith, B. A.,a graduate of the 
university, was made instructor in languages, and Charles N. Julian 
instructor in pure mathematics. J. E. Matheny was afterwards made 
instructor in shorthand. W.1I. Thomas was changed from instructor 
in ancient and modern languages to adjunct professor of English and 
modern languages. 
NEW EXPERIMENT STATION. 
In March, 1887, Congress passed what is known as the Hatch bill, to 
establish agricultural experiment stations in connection with thevarious 
agricultural colleges already founded in the different States. Onthe 28th 
day of the same month the Tennessee legislature passed an act accepting 
the gift ($15,000 per annum) and bestowing it upon the agricultural 
college of the university, with the provision that all the conditions of 
the donation shall be carried out. In order to better meet the demands 
the university trustees, in the following July, reorganized the agricul- 
tural department. President Dabney was made director of the station 
and entered upon his duties on the 4th of August. By an oversight no 
special appropriation clause had been included in the Congressional 
act, consequently nothing was realized till the meeting of the next 
Congress. Little could, therefore, be done till the spring of 1888. How- 
ever, wishing to push matters as fast as possible, Director Dabney 
added two men to his staff in September, 1887, viz, C. S. Plumb and ©.
-P-A-G-E-110
90 HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE. 
L. Newman. The former was at the same time elected professor of 
agriculture and took his place in the faculty. Mr. Newman’s election 
to a faculty position has already been mentioned. Prof. Plumb came 
from the assistant directorship of the New York Station, at Geneva. 
Mr. Newman had formerly been assistant at the Alabama Agricultural 
Experiment Station. He entered upon his duties at once. Prof. 
Piumb came on the 15th of October. As no funds were yet available, 
the practical work was at first limited. Yet plans were prepared for 
extensive operations in the following year. During the latter part of 
1887 a system of field and feeding experiments was organized. Some- 
thing was also done in a horticultural line. Fruit trees were pianted 
and a tool house erected. The old experiment station had operated 
without buildings or apparatus of any kind except such as belonged 
to the university, and the new organization had to begin in the sane 
way. However, steps were soon taken by the director to furnish the 
new station with all the needed equipments. During the summer of 
1888 a new station building, worth $6,800, was erected adjoining the 
agricultural hall on the south. The latter had never been completed. 
Both were now fitted up as one building for the accommodation of the 
station and the agricultural department of the university. The best 
gas, water, heating, and ventilating fixtures were putin. On the first 
floor were lecture room, library, chemical laboratory, offices, etc. Above 
were a large museum, botanical laboratories, biological and entomolog- 
ical laboratories, photographic room, ete. The first bulletin, containing 
(1) History and Reorganization, and (II) Dehorning Cattle, appeared 
in April, 1888, 
in addition to the improvements for the experiment station and the 
agricultural department, a new mechanical building was erected in the 
summer of 1888. It was arranged to contain lecture room for physics, 
room for drawing, toolroom, carpenter shop, lathe room, machine shop, 
blacksmith shop, boiler rooms, ete. The structure was of brick and 
cost $11,500. It has since been equipped with the best modern machin- 
ery and apparatus for giving instruction in the line of mechanic arts. 
About 100 students had entered this department in the fall of 1888. 
At the same time a residence was built for the president, at a cost of 
$5,000. It was located just east of the experiment station, overlooking 
the Tennessee River. 
REORGANIZATION OF 1888. 
President Dabney made few changes during his first year. Hecame 
into the work late and spent most of the year in organizing and fitting 
up the experiment station. Some changes and additions were made in 
the curriculum and teaching force. Dilapidated buildings were repaired 
and offices fitted up, but the rest of the year was spent largely in tak- 
ing an inventory of stock and formulating plans for the future. In the 
summer of 1888 an entire reorganization was effected.

THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE. 94 
Asan index to the president’s policy in the new organization, we 
quote from his report to the legislature in December, 1888. He says: 
Tho ‘leading objects” of these colleges were to be, 1n the language of the act, ‘to 
teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and the mechanic arts, 
* * * inorder to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial 
classes in the several pursuits and professions of life.” 
As interpreted by the best authorities and illustrated by the best institutions, 
this means that these colleges are to teach the sciences, and train youth inthe 
methods of the two great producing industries, farming and manufacturing, includ- 
ing planting, stock-raising, mining, engineering, both mechanical and civil, and 
general business. They were to be polytechnic institutes, not mero manual labor 
or industrial schools—though scientific men, engineers, and farmers should all be 
trained to work with their hands—but schools of the natural sciences, of engineering 
and technology; not schools to train farm laborers, miners, mechanics, and mere 
artisans, for these can be best trained on the farm, in the mine, or the shop, but 
institutes for the education, in the broadest sense of that word, of the future scien- 
tific agriculturist, tho mining engineer and metallurgist, the mechanical engineer, 
and the manufacturer of our country. 
It would be entirely unnecesary to stop to show that our country, and especially 
our State, needs such trained experts. We havo boasted about the ‘wonderful 
resources of the South” and their “development” until we are sick of the very words. 
But we do want to seesomething made out of them. What are our boasted climate, 
our fertile soils, forests of timber, or mountains of ore to us until turned into wealth? 
We are more weary still of this wretched twaddle about the ‘‘need of the immi- 
gration of skilled labor and of capital” to the South. Our best “resources” are our 
robust young men and women. We want to “develop” the power that is in them. 
This can only be done by education, and if we want to “develop our resources” we 
must educate our youth in the sciences and the useful arts. 
Nine-tenths of the engineers in our mines and on our railroads and the skilled 
mechanics in our shops and factories are imported. Our chemists, electricians, 
architects, and mechanical engineers all come from the North or abroad. This is 
well, but not best. The mechanic who comes from Pittsburg with his kit of tools 
to set our boilers, adjust our engines, and arrange our factories will do his work, 
pack his kit, and, like the Chinaman, take himself and his earnings back to the 
Jand he camo from. Foreign capital acts in very much the same way. It is well 
enough to have English speculators buy up our valuable mineral and timber lands 
and work them, even if the profit goes back to London, but it would be a great deal 
better, even if it came not quite so soon, if our young men supplied the brains to 
open up and the money to own these properties. 
The only sure way to develop a country is by developing its people. The boys of 
to-day are the men of to-morrow. The only permanent development is the educa- 
tion of, the development of power in, the man. To this end we need more schools of 
science and technology in the South. Custom and traditions are leading our South- 
ern colleges and universities to devote their attention too exclusively to languages 
and literature. It is folly to continue, as Huxley expresses it, ‘in this age of full 
modern artillery, to turn out our boys to do battle in it, equipped only with the 
sword and shield of an ancient gladiator.” The chemist’s balance and the engineer’s 
transit are better instruments for these times. 
In a scientific age and an industrial section an exclusive education in the dead 
languages is a curious anomaly. The flowers of literature should indeed be culti- 
vated, but it will not be wise to send men into our fields of industry to reap the 
harvest when they have been taught only to pick flowers and push aside the wheat. 
Our youth have the capacity and taste for these pursuits equal to any others. 
President Walker, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, makes, in a recent 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
  . 
92 HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE. 
report, the following remarks, which are most pertinent to this subjeet: Says he: 
“Among the gratifying features is the appearance of students from eleven Southern 
States. Believing, as I do, in the almost boundless possibilities of industrial growth 
in that portion of our country, it is with keen delight that I see so many of the gen- 
erous youths of the South turning from the rhetorical and dialectic exercises, 
which so engrossed the educational interests of the generations past, to qualify them- 
selves, by scientific and technological study and practice, to lead and direct the 
development of the industrial energies and the natural resources of that fair land.” 
It is a trite but true remark that we need to diversify our industries. Industrially 
and commercially our country is not in a healthy condition. We buy too much 
abroad and make too little at home. This subject is so important, and so intimately 
connected with our industrial and technical college, that a fuller consideration of it 
is justified. 
In speaking of the industrial changes of the last thirty years, Presi- 
dent Dabney says: 
All of the important industries were represented on the old time Southern farm. 
The wagon, plow, and blacksmith shop, the mill, the tannery, and the spinning and 
weaving house were the farm factories. In those days our people lived on the prod- 
ucts of the farm to a greatextent. Now-a-days they live out of the stores. 
There was not such a need for technical schools in those guod days as there is now. 
The boy saw the illustrations of simple industries everywhere, and daily opportu- 
nity was afforded him of trying his hand at some of them. Though he had far less 
familiarity with books, he had a much better acquaintance with the realities of life. 
Every observer must see that the manufactures are steadily leaving the farms and 
firesides of our people, and with them the best opportunities for the industrial train- 
ing of youth. Now the tendency everywhere is toward the concentiation of indus- 
tries. Even the small factories in the towns are dying out. Great combinations of 
capital choke out the small ones, and all the manufactures are collecting in the great 
cities. This movement tends to make an agricultural section more and more depend- 
ent and helpless. 
Now, do not the people of the South know what this means by this time? Have 
we not learned that the farming profession bears a very undue share of the burdens 
of all kinds? The farmers are the only people who do not “combine.” We are yet 
to hear ofa farmers cotton “ trust” or corn “trust.” The result is that the financial 
system ofthe country, the corporation laws, the tariff laws, the railroad, and nearly 
all the laws are against the land and the land owners. That property which is the 
foundation of all prosperity is made to bear nearly all the burdens, and that man 
who should be the freest in the world is made the ‘hewer of wood and the drawer 
of water” for every other class. To remain an exclusively agricultural people, and 
to buy all we need, means continued financial and commercial dependency, continued 
slavery to every class and interest—continued poverty. 
We hear a good deal, in the cotton-growing sections particularly, about the poor 
shiftless farmer who mortgages his farm, his mules and implements, his very crop 
itself, six months before it is made, to the commission merchant who ‘‘runs” him. 
He is but a type of the country, or state, which lives, in these days, upon farming 
alone. Thestate with only one industry, or one leading means of making a living, 
is just as badly off as the farmer with only one mortgaged crop. I have somewhere 
seen this illustration used: The South produced, we will say, $300,000,000 worth 
of cotton last year. Suppose we keep the whole crop, for one year, at home for 
manufacture and distribution. You begin by scattering $300,000,000 through our 
land, the price of the raw cotton. Next, let us spin it into yarns, and we almost 
double its value, and in doing so put nearly $300,000,000 into the pockets of our 
-people. You have now about $600,000,000 worth. Now weave these yarns into the 
best cloth, and you again double its value. You have $1,200,000,000 worth of prop-

erty, or four times what your crude material was worth, Sell it now and you have 
almost enough money to pay the National debt. This is the possibility. It is an 
ideal case, and the commerce of the world does not work in an ideal way, but the 
nearer we approximate this, the better it will be for us. 
There is a great deal of ineaning in what Emerson said, “If you do not use the 
tools they will use you.” Ifyou do not use machines yourself, the men who do use 
them will make a tool and a slave of you. 
The genus homo has been described by the naturalist as the tool-using animal. Cer- 
tainly the higher he gets up in the scale of being the more does he use tools. Ours 
is the age of tools. I believe it was Sir John Lubbock who said: “The old poet 
chose for the theme of his song ‘Arms and Men.’ ‘Tools and Men’ should be the 
theme of the epic of this century.” 
The state must promote higher education in all departments, but there are these 
great economic reasons why it is especially interested in scientific and technical 
education. Science and technology have direct influence upon the lives and fortunes 
of the people, and promote the industries which it is the peculiar duty of the state 
to cherish. 
In our country there are two great classes of universities or institutions for higher 
education—1, the state schools; 2, the denominational or church colleges. Each 
class has most excellent reasons for its existence. On the one hand, the Christian 
parents, of any denomination, have a perfect right, and a sound motive, for desiring 
that their sons shall be trained, especially in their earlier years, according to their 
own peculiar ideas as to religion and morals. On the other hand, the state must 
see to it that all young men are educated for the greatest usefulness and the highest 
success in life. State aid to higher education has become an established fact and 
a leading portion of the policy of all enlightened governments, though the time was 
when it was vigorously attacked by the clerical element, as it rarely is now, except 
in the most backward and ignorant communities. All true religion and philosophy 
teach us that we are our “ brother’s keeper,” and, amidst all these classes and sects 
among men, there is no other omnipresent and impartial agent except the state to 
see to “our brother’s ” proper education. 
Tho clerical influence has, properly enough, caused denominational colleges to 
devote themselves in the past almost exclusively to the cultivation of literature and 
the classics. In this field this class of institutions has done an unspeakably vast 
and far-reaching work in America. Nearly all of our American univerities were 
founded upon church schools. The devoted pastor who taught the children during 
the week and the grown people on the Lord’s day laid the foundations for good edu- 
cation in this country. The old dominie did the pioneer work and did it well. But 
he and his schools can never, from the nature of his training, become a leader in 
scientific research and in making correct interpretations and applications of science. 
It is his business, following St. Paul, to fight ‘science falsely so called,” and while 
doing this, history shows that he is not a particularly good friend of true science or 
of anything new in science. Hence it has become the special province of states to 
promote the natural sciences, both general and economic. Without neglecting lan- 
guages, literature, or philosophy, as the church colleges do not omit the natural 
sciences altogether from their courses, state institutions are particularly charged 
with the advancement of knowledge in this department. In a measure the one 
class of institutions is the complement of the other. It is safe to say that neither 
can, or should, take fully the place of the other in our American system of education, 
though the state school is steadily tending to and must ultimately become, every- 
where, the broadest and the most liberal, and realize most fully the true university 
idea. 
The board of trustees, under whom the reorganization was effected,

School of Virginia, 1. 
The departments of instruction comprised, first the academic, which 
was subdivided into the collegiate and the university, or post-gradu- 
ate; secondly, the professional, located at Nashville, which was sub- 
divided into a course in medicine and a course in dentistry. 
The collegiate department embraced the following courses of study: 
(a) Literary-scientific. 
(0) Latin-scientific. 
(c) Course in agriculture. 
(@) Course in civil engineering. 
(e) Course of mechanical engineering. 
(f) Course in chemistry. 
(g) Course in mining engineering. 
These led to the degrees of bachelor of science, bachelor of philoso- 
phy, bachelor of agriculture, bachelor of science in engineering, and 
bachelor of science in applied chemistry. 
The university department included courses for the graduate degrees 
of master of arts, master of science, and doctor of philosophy. The 
first and second required one year of study; the third, two years. 
Secondly, were the professional courses, leading to degrees of civil engi- 
neer, mining engineer, and mechanical engineer. In the third place 
were courses for special students in the various departments. Univer- 
sity students working for degrees were required to be graduates of the 
academic department of this or equivalent schools and resident at the 
university. Master of agriculture was afterwards introduced. 
The medical department at Nashville gave the degree of doctor of 
medicine; the dental department, that of doctor of dental surgery. 
The following subdepartments, or schools, were included in the aca- 
demic department: 
(1) School of ancient languages, with one professor and one instructor. 
(2) School of English and modern languages, with two professors 
and one assistant professor. 
(3) School of mathematics and civil engineering, with two professors 
and one instructor.

THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE. 97 
The preparatory department was abolished. A few subcollegiate 
classes were retained to meet a present demand. 
Four new schools of study had been established, viz: Mechanical 
engineering and physics, agricultural and organic chemistry botany 
and horticulture, and biology and zodlogy. ij 
The president, the dean of the college, and the commandant of cadets 
constituted a governing committee for discipline among the students. 
All collegiate students were put under strict military rules. The dean 
also had charge of entrance examinations, classification, records, and 
reports. 
The library was overhauled and recatalogued according to the well- 
known Dewey decimal classification system. It now contains, as pre- 
viously stated, about 6,000 volumes. The experiment-station library 
contains 2,500 "volumes. 
AS cepards the working policy of the ecipel President Dabney bent 
every energy in the direction of science and industrial lines. Latin and 
Greek were still retained, but they were made far less prominent than 
formerly. The work was well done, but fewer students were encouraged. 
to take it. The work in all departments was made largely practical in 
character. Students were trained to habits of observation. The eye 
was taught to see and the hand to execute, “believing,” in the words 
of the president, “that the best way to learn to do a thing is by doing 
it.” Hence a great deal of time was devoted to practice and laboratory 
work, in which the student sought to apply the principles taught and 
was encouraged to discover new facts for himself. As lectures were 
delivered in chemistry, biology, and botany, students were expected 
to work out in the laboratory the principles set forth. The microscope 
was extensively used in studying the fungous diseases of plants, ete. 
Much special work was done in the study of the grasses. The agri- 
cultural classes had practical work in the field, garden, orchard, dairy, 
and stable, and were expected to become familiar with the use of farm 
implements and machines. In horticulture students were taught graft- 
ing, budding, use of hotbeds, etc. Students in engineering surveyed 
imaginary railroads, built bridges, and constructed tunnels. In me- 
chanical engineering they drew plans, worked in wood, and learned 
the use of machines. In biology they dissected and studied animals, 
collected specimens, and made classifications. Even in the more liter- 
ary studies, where the practical is not so easy, laboratory methods were 
extensively pursued. 
In 1889 the teachers’ course, which had been left out of the new 
organization, was revived. It extended over two spring terms of five 
months each. Those completing it were granted a certificate. Only 
actual teachers could enter. Improvements went steadily forward this 
year. Electric lights and electric bells were put in and further repairs 
were made. 
Prof. C. 8S. Plumb resigned the chair of agriculture in April, 1890,

and also his position in the experiment station, to accept a position: in 
the Indiana State experiment station.” His place was filled the next 
year by the election ef Maj. C. F. Vanderford, formerly of the State 
agricultural department at Nashville. Prof. Stonewall Tompkins was 
also elected superintendent of shops, vice J.S. Coon, resigned. . W. M. 
Yager was made instructor in mechanics, and H. J. Darnall instructor 
in German. Commandant Matheson also resigned in 1890, and his 
office was added to the chair of military science, occupied by Lieut. E. 
E. Gayle, of the U.S. Army. Cooper D. Schmitt, um. A. (University of 
Virginia), was elected assistant professor of mathematics. 
The experiment-station work was greatly increased after the reorgan- 
ization. Various collections were made. The Gattinger Herbarium, 
of Nashville, containing 4,500 plants, was purchased for use of uni- 
versity and station. Fungi and other specimens were secured from 
various parts of this country and foreign countries. The publications 
of the stations were of three kinds: annual reports, quarterly bulletins, 
and special bulletins; the last at irregular intervals, The annuals 
give full details of the work in the various divisions. The quarterlies ~ 
contain brief outlines of the same where early publication is necessary. 
The specials are to give the farmer information which may be urgently 
demanded without any delay. Among the various subjects upon’ 
which bulletins have been issued, the following may be mentioned: 
“Weeds of the Farm,” “Grasses of Mountain Meadows and Deer 
_ Parks,” “Diseases of the Irish Potato,” “Chemical Compositions and 
Tests of Varieties of Strawberries,” and “Points about Country Roads.” 
President Dabney resigned the station directorship in 1899 to become 
station chemist, Dr. Stone having resigned to take a professorship in 
Purdue University. Prof. Scribner was then elected station director. 
Other additions and changes occurred about the same time. L.P.Brown 
was elected acting chemist for a while, to be succeeded by J.B. McBryde 
as assistant chemist. W. N. Price succeeded C. L. Newman in the 
field and feeding division. Paul F. Kefauver has been added to the 
staff as agriculturist. The entomologist, H. E. Summers, resigned and 
went on a scientific expedition to South America in 1891. 
In order to accommodate working men. who could not attend the day 
sessions, a night school was established in the fall of 1889. It was of 
an industrial character. The citizens of Knoxville aided liberally with 
their means. Instruction was given in English grammar, composition, 
and rhetoric; practical book-keeping, algebra, geometry; freehand, 
elementary, and advanced mechanical drawing; penmanship, business 
letters and forms; fuels and furnaces; boilers and steam engines; elec- 
tricity and its applications; methods of heating and ventilating; chem- 
istry of iron and steel; mortars and cement; photography, blue-prints, 
ete. No tuition was charged and the instructors, who belonged to the 
university, donated their time. The sessions were held in the Mechan- 
ical building on Monday, Wednesday and Friday evenings throughout
-P-A-G-E-125
  
THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE. 99 
January, February, March and April. The members of the teaching 
force were: Prof.S. Tompkins, principal; Prof. T. W. Jordan, language; 
Prof. f. C. Karns, English; Prof. C. D. Schmitt, mathematics; Prof. 
R. 8. Collins (of Knoxville Business College), book-keeping and pen- 
manship; W. R. Ellington, freehand drawing; W. M. Yagcr, mechan- 
ieal drawing. A number of popular lectures on such subjects as chem- 
istry, electricity, and political economy, were delivered during the 
session. 
' DEPARTMENT OF LAW. 
At the beginning of the second term of 1889-90, a Jepartment of 
law was established with ex-Supreme Judge Thomas J. Freeman, dean 
and professor in charge. The course of study extended through two 
years, though students could by previous study enter the advanced 
class. After passing the first term of first year the students organized 
a moot court for the practice of the principles acquired. The course 
led to the degree of bachelor of laws. To enter, applicants must be 19 
years old and have a good English education. Law students could also 
enter literary classes with privilege of reading room and library, as 
well as become members of the literary societies. Tuition was $50 for 
five months. Special lectures by distinguished members of the bar are 
delivered annually. Judge Freeman was a native of Tennessee. He 
sat on the supreme bench of Tennessee for sixteen years. The reports 
for that period bear witness to his industry, ability, and learning. 
During the spring term of 1891 Judge Freeman was compelled to rest 
on account of ill health. His place was filled by Hon. H. H. Ingersoll, 
a graduate of Yale, and a prominent lawyer in the State and national 
courts. Judge Freeman died in the fall of 1891, and Judge Ingersoll 
succeeded him as dean. Mr. George E. Beers, a graduate of the Yale 
Law School, was elected associate professor. The first law class, num- 
bering 7 members, graduated in 1891. 
YOUNG MEN’S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION. 
* Messrs. Hall and Cree, of the international committee of Young 
Men’s Christian Associations, held some meetings at the university in 
1877, and on February 2 of that year organized a local association. D. 
B. Johnson, of the class of 1877, was the first president; James H. 
Cowan, vice-president; Charles J. Heiskell, secretary; and John M. 
Allen, treasurer. The first meetings were held in the old chapel. 
Afterwards a room was secured in the steward’s hall, and later apart- 
ments were opened on second floor of East College. In 1887 rooms were 
fitted up on first floor. The association has had its seasons of difficulty, 
but, from a small beginning, has arisen to be a power in the life of the 
school. It brought together at Knoxville the first conference of asso- 
ciations in East Tennessee. The university association has rarely failed 
to be represented in international and State conventions. One of its 
 
-P-A-G-E-126

»st zealous members, Mr. James H. Cowan, has done much good 
rk, not only locally but through the State. A convention of the East 
nnessee college associations was held at the university in February, 
39. Seventy delegates were present. A great revival among the 
idents followed, in which 35 were converted. 
On February 22, 1890, Mr. C. K. Ober, of the international commit- 
3, held a meeting at the university and started a subscription for a 
w building. Many students subseribed $100 each, and as a result 
,500 was raised on the spot. After some days $6,000 was reached. 
e university trustees offered $3,000 provided $7,000 was raised in a 
ren time. The amount was secured and dirt was broken for the new 
ilding on June 9, 1890. The ambition of the founders grew as time 
ogressed, and the resultis a fine, modern three-story building, which, 
th equipment, cost about $20,000, It stands on the southeast side of 
2 campus and commands a fine view of the river and mountains. 
e first floor is devoted to a bowling alley, ball cage, and heating fur- 
ce, On the second floor is the gymnasium, barber shop, amusement 
ms, dressing rooms, lockers, and bath rooms. On the third 
itrance) floor are the secretary’s office, reception room, drawing room, 
iding room, assembly hall, race track, and visitors’ gallery. This 
the first college Young Men’s Christian Association building erected 
ith of Baltimore. Mr. H. K. Denlinger, honor graduate of Prince- 
1, was appointed director of the gymnasium in 1891. 
{t is not necessary to say that President Dabney was “the power 
hind the throne” in the conception and successful realization of this 
sa of a house for the association. It was a part of his plan in build- 
z up the university that religious interests and influences should not 
neglected. 
In 1890 Congress made an additional appropriation to the land-grant 
leges of the various States. The amount is to be taken from the 
ec of public lands. It begins with $15,000 on June 30, 1890, and is 
eased $1,000 each year till the donation reaches $25,000, which sum 
to be paid thereafter annually. This fund can go only to “instruc- 
n in agriculture, the mechanic arts, the English language, and the 
rious branches of mathematical, physical, natural, and economic 
ences, with special reference to their applications in the industries of 
», and to the facilities for such instruction.” The State legislature 
ve its assent as required by law. 
Che teachers’ department was greatly strengthened m 1890 by the 
ction of Prof. Frank M. Smith as principal. Prof. Smith was, at the 
ae, State superintendent of public instruction, and did not take charge 
i the spring term of 1891. Prof. Smith had Jong been connected with 
3 public school work of the State as teacher, county superintendent, 
y superintendent, and State superintendent. For completion of the 
ise a certificate is granted which enables the bearer to teach in any 
blic school of the State without further examination. The course

embraces higher -arithmetic, algebra, geometry, composition, rhetoric, 
general history, English literature; regular course of Latin through 
sop more year; five hours per waasl for two terms in some science, 
including agriculture and geology; and pedagogy, including theory and 
practice and history, and science of education. 
F. R. Jones, M. E., of Cornell, was elected superintendent of shops to 
succeed Prof. Tompkins, who had resigned. The following instructors 
were also elected: P. L. Cobb, in ancient languages; J. R. McColl, in 
mechanics; E. M. Davis, in English; 8. W. McCallie, in geology; P. F. 
Kefauver, in practical agriculture; and R. L., Watts, in horticulture. 
The plan of designating high schools, whose preparatory work would 
be received for entrance at the university, was adopted in 1890. The 
University School of Columbia, Institute at Lewisburg, Memphis Insti- 
tute, University High School at Knoxville, Wall and Mooney School 
at Franklin, the Yerkes School at Paris, Ky., and the Bingham School 
of North Carolina, on application, were admitted to the list. One free 
scholarship was awarded to the best graduate of each school. After- 
wards were added the High School of Asheville, N. C.; the Peabody 
High School of Little Rock, Ark.; the University School of Kansas 
City, Mo.; the University School of Monticello, Ark., and high schools 
in Tennessee at the places following: Alexandria, Chattanooga, Clarks- 
ville, Cleveland, Clinton, Columbia, Dyersburg, Jonesboro, Knoxville, 
Lexington, McMinnville, Memphis, Milan, Nashville, Newbern, Pulaski, 
Rogersville, Trenton, and West Knoxville. 
In the fall of 1890 military government was dropped after an unin- 
terrupted course of about nineteen years. The teaching of military 
science and drill were retained and taught, as required by law. The 
government was put upon a civil basis, under the direction of the dean. 
For some years a feeling had prevailed in the faculty that military dis- 
cipline consumed, by far, too much of the student’s time and was det. 
rimental to morals and true development. So long as the school was 
uncer military control it was used by many parents as a sort of school 
of correction for incorrigibles. The system of constant. espionage and 
irksome punishment for small offenses in which no violation of moral 
law was involved broke down moral discrimination and incited reck- 
lessness and riotous conduct. The wisdom of the change has been 
abundantly shown by subsequent results. 
In 1891 the number of subdepartments, or schools, was increased to 
fourteen by various divisions and additions. The requirements for 
admission to the freshman class were then, in agricultural, engineer- 
ing, and literary-scientific courses, as follows: A good knowledge of 
composition and English grammar; arithmetic complete and algebra 
to quadratics; three books of geometry; geography and United States 
history. Those taking the Latin-scientifie course were required to 
know the Latin forms and read the simpler prose writers.

try, U. S. Army, was appointed professor of military science and tac- 
tics and commandant of cadets, Lieut. Gayle having been recalled to 
the Army. 
Prof. George I’. Mellen, pu. D. (Leipsic), was elected associate pro- 
fessor of Greek and French during the summer of 1891 and took charge 
at the opening of the fall term. Mr. J. D. Hoskins was also appointed 
instructor in mathematics. The number in faculty of academic depart- 
ment was now 21. 
SCHOLARSHIPS. 
There are 275 State scholarships. One free scholarship is given 
to each of the university’s accredited high schools, as before stated, 
being awarded to the best graduate of the school. At the close of 
every session the faculty awards a scholarship to the best regular 
student in the freshman, sophomore, and junior classes. Students in 
the teachers’ department receive free tuition. Twelve agricultural and 
mechanical apprenticeships, in which the holders earn about $100 a 
year for work, are awarded to meritorious under-graduate students. 
Four fellowships worth about $200 a year are given to post-graduate 
or advanced special students.

AUTHORSHIP. 
President Humes is the author of numerous addresses and transient 
papers. Healso wrote “The Loyal Mountaineers,” a work of much his- 
torical importance as pertaining to East Tennessee’s record in the civil 
var. This book was written after his retirement from the presidency. 
Prof. F. D. Allen, now professor of classical philology in Harvard Uni- 
versity, has edited a number of Greek books for use in schools and eol- 
eges. 
Prof. I. T. Beckwith, now of Trinity College, has also edited some of 
the Greek authors. He and Prof. Allen both stand high as Greek 
scholars. 
Prof. E.8. Joynes, now of Columbia, 8. C., has written numerous text 
ocks for the study of German. ~ 
Prof. W. G. MeAdoo has written an elementary geology of Ten- 
nessee. 
Dr. C. W. Kent, now of the university, has made an extensive and 
critical study of old English and has lately published a student’s edi- 
tion of the old English poem Elene. 
Prof. F. Lamson-Scribner has made an extensive study of the grasses 
and the fungous diseases of plants. Besides numerous papers and ex- 
periment station bulletins, he has published a book on “ The Fungous 
Diseases of Grapes and other Plants, and their Treatment.” 
President Dabney has published a number of papers in scientific jour- 
nals, numerous experiment station reports, and other matter. 
SCIENCE HALL, 
President Dabney’s administration has been especially characterized 
by the erection of many much needed buildings. 
Besides the experiment station building, the mechanical building and 
the Young Men’s Christian Association building, mentioned elsewhere, 
and the expenditure of $25,000 in repair of old buildings, the founda- 
tion for a new Science Hall was laid in 1890, This is now (1891) near- 
ing completion and will cost about $60,000. It will contain a pub- 
lic hall for chapel and general exercises, the president’s office, chem> 
ical laboratories, laboratory for physics, mineralogy, and geology; 
also rooms for drawing and the lecture rooms of the engineering schools 
and a large museum of mineralogy and economic geology. The money 
to erect this building was obtained principally from the sale of 49 acres ~ 
of land adjoining the college farm. The land was not needed for agri- 
eultural purposes, and had recently so appreciated in value that it 
brought $1,000 an acre. 
INSTRUCTION OF COLORED STUDENTS. 
The constitution of the State of Tennessee provides that there shall 
be no discrimination against colored persons in any of the public 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
  104 HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE. 
schools. The university being simply the head of the public school 
system, the act endowing the institution with the proceeds of the land 
grant sets forth that “no citizen of this State, otherwise qualified, shall 
be excluded from the privileges of the university by reason of his race 
or color; but the accommodation and instruction of persons of color 
shall be separate from the white.” 
For many years, of course, no colored persons were found qualified 
to take advantage of the grade of instruction provided by the univer- 
sity. When, later, a few State appointees to scholarships were found 
qualified, their tuition was paid at Fisk University, at Nashville, and 
then also at Knoxville College, Knoxville, Tenn. When the present 
management took charge of the institution, and the number of colored 
appointees increased considerably, steps were taken to establish a 
regular department in the university for the benefit of this class of 
students. In response to an inquiry addressed to the attorney-general 
of the State, an opinion was received from him to the effect that all the 
departments of the university ought to be located at Knoxville, in im- 
mediate relation with, and under the direct supervision of, the trustees 
and faculty. As soon, therefore, as the students then attending Fisk 
University could be graduated, steps were taken which led to the 
establishment of such a department at Knoxville. By contract with 
the trustees of Knoxville College, an excellent institution for the edu- 
cation of colored people, the buildings, grounds, and teaching staff of 
that institution were made available for the university as its colored 
department. 
The facilities there provided needed, however, to be supplemented 
along the line of scientific and industrial education. The president 
accordingly visited some of the friends of this institution at the North, 
and secured the funds for a new scientific and mechanical building. 
A tract of jand adjacent to the college was provided for practical work 
in agriculture and horticulture. The new building contains a chemical 
laboratory, drawing rooms, and shops for instruction in mechanic arts. 
Three new instructors were provided, and all the new departments 
were well equipped. The new department is called the industrial 
department for colored students, and is as immediately under the super- 
vision of the trustees and president of the university as any other 
department of the institution, all of its teachers being elected by the 
trustees, and the entire expenses of the department being paid by 
them. The several professors of the university have supervision of the 
work there in their respective departments. 
‘It is designed to give colored men in this institution that opportunity 
for industrial education which they somuch need. Students are encour- 
aged and required. to work in the shops and upon the farm, and get in 
this way a practical skill which will be of benefit to them in later life. 
Twelve apprenticeships, worth $50 per annum each, have been created
-P-A-G-E-141
THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE. 105 
for the benefit of these students, and are available both in the agricul- 
tural and mechanical schools. It is believed that the university has 
thus solved a somewhat difficult problem in a very happy and useful 
manner. 
MISCELLANEOUS. 
For many years an alumni association has béen in regular organiza- 
tion. Its exercises generally occur in connection with the university 
commencements. = : 
The Greek-letter fraternities are represented at the university by 
four chapters, the Tau-Delta-Theta, the Sigma-Alpha-Epsilon, the Phi- 
Gamma-Delta, and the Kappa-Sigma. They are favored by the man- 
agement, and no troubles have arisen. 
For many years a students’ journal under many names has been sus- 
tained. The editors are now elected by the various classes. Formerly 
each literary society supported a paper under the management of its 
own editors. - More or less friction has arisen at different periods be- 
tween the papers and the college authorities. The present publication” 
is the-Tennessee University Student. 
College sports have prevailed to some extent. An athletic associa- 
tion was organized in 1889 by Prof. C.S. Plumb. It has since that 
time given annually a public field-day exercise, in which prizes are 
awarded for leaping, running, throwing weights, ete. A regular Sys- 
tem of training under a teacher is now carried on in the new gymna- 
sium. Base ball and foot ball are popular sports. Boating has not 
been a success. A club with boathouse and boats was organized some 
years ago, but soon failed for want of interest. Tennis clubs flourish. 
CONCLUSION. 
The career of the university has been similar to that of other State 
institutions. Many difficulties had to be encountered and overcome. 
Industrial education was necessarily a thing of slow growth. During 
the transition period from the old classical college to the modern scien- 
tific and practical] school much of friction and loss was sustained. Be- 
ing a State school, with free tuition, jealousy was aroused among the 
denominational and private schools. Political bickerings by the two 
parties and frequent changes, to satisfy popular clamor, sometimes 
worked evil. Fortunately these things are now of the past. The future 
is bright in every respect. During the first year of the present admin- 
istration the attendance in the academic department rose from 160 to 
203. In the next year it was 249, and the year following 251. The at- 
tendance in all departments for 1890-91 reached a total of 513. Much 
is due to the past, but the present renaissance is a period of greatest 
prosperity and hope.

CHAPTER IV. 
VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY. 
CENTRAL UNIVERSITY OF THE METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH 
SOUTH. 
On the 7th of January, 1858, the general assembly of Tennessee 
passed an act chartering Central University of the General Conference 
of the Methodist Episcopal Church South. The corporators, who were 
trustees, were Joshua Soule, James O, Andrew, Robert Paine, George 
F, Pierce, John Early, H. H. Kavanaugh, A. L. P. Green, J. B. MeFer- 
rin, John W. Hanner, William B. Campbell, Jonathan McDonald, W. 
R. Elliston, John P. Ford, Thomas ©. Maddin, and James C. Malone. 
Bishop Soule and Dr. A. L. P. Green had originated the movement 
looking to the establishment of Centrai University, and with the 
assistance of Dr. John H. Callender, had prepared the charter. This 
instrument bestowed upon the General Conference of the Metho- 
dist Episcopal Church South powers of supervision over the board of 
trustees and the right of filling vacancies in that body. Vacancies 
occurring while the conference was not in session were to be filled by 
the trustees themselves, subject to the confirmation of the conference. 
They were empowered “to establish at Nashvillé a university compris- 
ing an academic or literary department, a scientific, and such other 
departments as they” might “see proper.” 
Departments of law and medicine, with separate boards of self-per- 
petuating trustees, were specially incorporated by the charter. The 
acts of these boards required the confirmation of the general univer- 
sity board. ‘The title to and the control of the property of the medical 
department were vested in its faculty, who were likewise its board of 
trustees. This faculty was composed of John P. Ford, Thomas A. 
Atchison, William P. Jones, Thomas L. Maddin, and John H. Callen- 
der, with power to increase 1ts number to ten if necessary. The name 
given the department was “The Shelby Medical College of Central 
University of the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal 
Church South.” The trustees of the law department were Milton 
Brown, John 8. Brien, Andrew Ewing, A.S. Colyar, Robert C. Foster, 
sr., Charles W. Moorman, and Thomas Martin. 
Central University, we see, was largely conceived. It was to be a 
university in fact as well as in name, a place where all branches of 
knowledge, both professional and nonprofessional, were to be taught.

108 HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE. 
The support of a large and powerful church would insure it a patron- 
age. 
At the meeting of the general conference of the church in May, 
1858, the charter of Central University was submitted to it for its ac- 
ceptance. The conference did not accept the charter, but disposed of 
it in the following preamble and resolution: 
Whereas the charter of the Central University of the Methodist Episcopal Church 
South, obtained from the legislature of the State of Tennessee, has been presented 
to this conference for its reception; and whereas this conferenco has no organized 
existence except during its sessions, which occur but once in four years, which is 
too seldom for the practical management of said institution, and it.is not therefore 
expedient that this conference receive said charter: Therefore, 
Resolved, That the Tennessee annual conference, at its next session, take into con- 
sideration the propriety of receiving said institution under its care and manage- 
ment; and that any other annual conference that may choose to do so join the Ten- 
nessee conference in this measure, and that measures be taken to have the charter 
so changed as to conform it to such an arrangement. 
Although for the reason stated the general conference could not 
assume the-direction of a great university, its temper on the subject of 
university education was unmistakable; its committee on education 
reported in favor of an “institution of higher grade than the ordinary 
collegiate institution, to take the student when the college leaves 
him.” 
The war coming on soon after this, the enterprise languished, but the 
idea had taken deep hold on the church, and after the clouds of civil 
strife had rolled away not many years elapsed before it issued in prac- 
tical results. It is worthy of special remark that the general confer- 
ence suggested that the annual conferences undertake the care and 
management of the proposed university, for when Central University 
was finally established it was upon the plan of codperating annual 
conferences. The Central University of 1858 contained the germ of 
the Central University of a later time. 
SHELBY MEDICAL COLLEGE. 
Notwithstanding the action of the general conference, Shelby Med- 
ical College was organized under the charter of Central University. It 
occupied buildings on the northeast corner of Broad and Vine streets, 
in the city of Nashville. Being under the same roof with the City 
Charity Hospital, it was enabled to offer superior clinical advantages. 
The faculty consisted of E. B. Haskins, professor of practical medicine 
and clinical medicine; John Frederick May, professor of surgery and 
clinical surgery; John P. Ford, professor of obstetrics and clinical 
obstetrics; Thomas L. Maddin, professor of anatomy and histology; 
Daniel F. Wright, professor of physiology; John H. Callender, profes- 
sor of materia medica and therapeutics; Henri Ervin, professor of 
chemistry; and M. Compton, demonstrator in practical anatomy. 
Highty-five young men attended lectures the first year and 120 the third

year. From December 28, 1862, until June 1, 1865, the property of the 
college was in the hands of the United States military authorities. 
The buildings were left in a dilapidated condition, and the cabinets, 
museum, and apparatus converted into little more than a heap of rub- 
bish. Only a minority of the professors Survived the war. Of the sur- 
vivors, Drs. Maddin and Callender were elected to professorships in the 
medical department of the University of Nashville. 
REVIVAL OF THE UNIVERSITY MOVEMENT AFTER THE WAR. 
The university idea was revived after the war in the form of a senti- 
ment in favor of a central theological seminary for the whole church. 
In their address to the general conference, April 6, 1866, the bishops 
recommended the founding of such a seminary. The address was 
signed by Bishops Andrew, Early, Paine, and. Kavanaugh, Bishops 
Soule and Pierce being absent. The report of ‘the committee of the 
conference on education—and their report was adopted—concurred in 
the opinion of the episcopal college that the church demanded a theo- 
logical seminary, but thought that the prostrate condition of the 
country consequent upon the civil war would not warrant an attempt 
to establish one at that time. They advised instead, as a temporary 
expedient, the organization of biblical schools in connection with the 
annual conference colleges. ¢ 
But some grew impatient for the time to come when the church would 
be able to provide a higher culture for her ministry. In 1868 Bishop 
H. N. McTyeire and Dr. T. O. Summers induced Dr. L. C. Garland, a 
professor in the University of Mississippi, who was well known through- 
out the South as an educator, to write a series of articles in the Chris- 
tian Advocate in favor of ministerial education. 
The next general conference met in Memphis, Tenn., May, 1870. 
The address of the bishops would have contained the same recommen- 
dation in regard to a theological seminary that the address of 1866 had 
contained if Bishop Pierce had not this time been present and stren- 
uously opposed its insertion. A majority favored it, but out of defer- 
ence to him it was not incorporated into the address, and a noncom- 
mittal tone was adopted instead. As a consequence the public misun- 
derstood the attitude of the bishops on the subject. The conference was 
the scene of along contest between the advocates and the opponents of a 
theological seminary for the whole church. Two reports came up from 
the committee on education—a majority and a minority report—one 
recommending the establishment of a central theological school, the 
other favoring the creation of biblical chairs in existing colleges. The 
minority report was adopted, but it was the opinion of many that the 
sentiment of the conference was not fairly expressed by the vote. The 
secret of the opposition to a theological seminary was to be found 
chiefly in the apprehensions of the smaller colleges that they might be 
eclipsed by a school belonging to the whole church. 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
  
  110 HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE. 
It was now that the full university idea, as conceived in the Central 
University of twelve years before, was reverted to. The advocates of 
- ministerial education, finding that they could not get a separate theo- 
logical school, had recourse to a university including a theological 
school as one of its departments. Prominent among the promoters of 
this plan were Bishops MeTyeire and Paine and Drs. A. L. P. Green, 
R, A. Young, and L. ©. Garland. The question was diligently agi- 
tated until “the whole educational atmosphere, so to speak, was, 
toward the close of the conference, rife with the conception of a great 
university, having as one of its departments a thoroughly organized 
theological school.” ‘Finally, about the close of the conference, a few 
ardent advocates of the measure met informally and conferred together 
about the matter. * * * And upon separating it was agreed that 
the subject of establishing a great university of the highest grade and 
with the most ample endowment should be agitated throughout the 
connection, through the press and by public addresses, and that the 
conferences should be invited to send delegates to aconvention for the 
consideration of the matter.” 
THE MEMPHIS CONVENTION. 
The Central University project of 1858 had done much to awaken a 
feeling in favor of a school of broader scope and higher standard under 
the patronage and control of the whole church. There were, besides, 
needs of a local nature which an institution properly located would fill. 
A largecentral territory in Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, 
and Arkansas was without a Methodist college. These influences, favor- 
able to the proposed university, added to the demand for a theological 
seminary, account for the rapidity with which the plans for that uni- 
versity, when once set on foot, advanced to maturity. To Dr. D. C. 
Keliey belongs the credit of taking the step that led to the speedy 
erystallization of these plans. Dr. Kelley, whose own mind had some 
time before been running along these lines, had his attention recalled 
in that direction by reading a communication in The Western Methodist 
of Memphis, calied forth by an editorial of the editor, Dr. W. CO. John- 
son, on the subject of the proposed establishment of a university by the 
united action of the Tennessee, North Alabama, Memphis, and North 
Mississippi conferences. At the meeting of the Tennessee conference 
at Lebanon, in October, 1871, he presented the following resolution: 
Resolved, That we request the presiding bishop to appoint a committee of three 
to confer with the Memphis, North Alabama, North Mississippi, and any other confer- 
ence likely to codperate with us in reference to the establishment and endowment 
ofa Methodist university of high grade and large endowment. 
The resolution was passed. Drs. R. A. Young, A. L. P. Green, and 
D. ©. Kelley were appointed the committee. The conferences were vis- 
ited, and delegates were appointed by them to meet in convention in 
Memphis January 24, 1872. On the designated day delegates from 
 
-P-A-G-E-147

the Little Rock, White River, Memphis, Alabama, North Alabama, 
Mississippi, North Mississippi, Louisiana, and Tennessee conferences, 
representing middle and west Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Louis- 
iana, and Arkansas, assembled in the basement of the Second Street 
Methodist Church, Memphis. Dr. A. L. P. Green brought with him 
the charter of the Central University of 1858. He had done more, 
perhaps, than any other man to keep alive the university idea. He 
was, as it were, the connecting link between the old Central Univer- 
sity, which had failed, and the new Central University, which was to 
succeed. 
Bishops Paine and McTyeire were present, and by invitation presided 
over the meetings of the convention. It was in session four days, Jan- 
uary 24, 25, 26, and 27. The results of its deliberations are found in 
the following resolutions: , 
Resolved by the convention (1), That measures be adopted looking to the establish- 
ment, as speedily as practicable, of an institution of learning of the highest order 
and upon the surest basis, where the youth of the church and country may prose- 
cute theological, literary, scientific, and professional studies to an extent as great 
and in a manner as thorough as their wants demand. 
(2) That the institution shall be called the Central University of the Methodist 
Episcopal Church, South. 
(3) That it shall consist, at present, of five schools or departments, viz: A theo- 
logical school, for the training of our young preachers, who, on application for 
admission, shall present a recommendation from a quarterly or annual conference, 
and shall have obtained a standard of education equal to that required for admission 
on trial into an annual conference; and instruction to them shall be free, both in 
the theological and the literary and scientific departments. Secondly, a literary 
and scientific school. Thirdly, anormal school. Fourthly, alaw school. Fifthly, 
a medical school. 
(4) That the sum of $1,000,000 is necessary in order to realize fully the object 
desired, and not less than $500,000 must be secured as a condition precedent to the 
opening of any department of the university. 
(5) That the location of the university shall be left to the decision of the college 
of bishops of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. 
(6) That the carrying out of this whole scheme is hereby committed to the per- 
sons herein named before as petitioners, who shall take immediate steps for secur- 
ing a suitable charter of incorporation, and shall be a board of trust, with power to 
solicit and invest funds, appoint an agent or agents, and to do whatever else is nee- 
essary for the execution of this scheme. 
(7) That seven of the board of trustees, at any meeting regularly called, shall con- 
stitute a quorum. 
(8) That provision be made in the charter for giving a fair representation in the 
management of the university to any annual conference hereafter codperating with 
us. 
(9) That the bishops of the Methodist Episeopal Church, South, be, and are hereby, 
requested to act as a board of supervision of the university or any of its depart- 
ments, and jointly with the board of trust to elect officers and professors and pre- 
scribe the course of study and the plan of government. 
The twofold character and purpose of the university appear in clauses 
Gand 8,5 and 9. First, as supplying the needs of certain contiguous 
conferences for college education; secondly, as providing for the whole

church and country the means of university and professional educa- 
tion. The board of trustees was constituted by the representatives of 
the codperating conferences; the board of supervision, whose powers 
were tantamount to those of trustees, by the bishops of the whole 
church. 
The Central University of 1858 was projected on a large scale; the 
Central University of 1872 was projected on even a larger. One million 
of dollars were considered necessary to the full realization of the plan, 
and no department was to be opened until $500,000 had been raised. 
But there were not wanting apprehensions that no such sum could be 
got from an impoverished people not yet recovered from the disasters 
of the civil war. 
The Memphis resolutions were afterwards embodied in the charter 
of the university and became a part of its organic law. For the pur- 
pose of carrying them out a board of trustees composed of representa- 
tives from the codperating conferences was appointed and authorized 
to apply for a charter. August 19, 1872, the chancery court at Nash- 
ville granted a charter to the Central University of the Methodist 
Episcopal Church South. 
ORGANIZATION OF THE BOARD OF TRUST. 
Immediately after the adjournment of the Memphis convention the 
board of trust met and organized by the election of Judge Edward H. 
Hast, president; Dr. D. C. Kelley, secretary, and Dr. A. L. P. Green, 
treasurer. Meetings were subsequently held at Nashville, Tenn., Iuka, 
Miss., and Brownsville, Tenn., in the months of May and August, 1872, 
and January, 1873, respectively. At the August meeting a resolution 
was passed requesting each annual conference codperating to nominate 
four representatives. These nominations made, the board would reor- 
ganize so as to secure the election of the nominees. Thereafter when 
vacancies occurred they would be filled by the nominees of the confer- 
ences confirmed by the board. At its next meeting the board was 
reorganized conformably to this resolution. Four conferences, North 
Alabama, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana, having failed to take

absent, their seats in the board were declared vacant. The conferences 
now actively codperating were the Tennessee, Memphis, North Missis- 
sippi, Arkansas, White River, and Little Rock. Arkansas conference 
had come in since the charter was obtained in August, 1872. The 
representatives of these six conferences in the board of trust were: 
Tennessee conference: Rev. A. L. P. Green, D. D., Rey. D.C. Kelley, 
D. D., Hon. E. H. East, Col. D. T. Reynolds.

Some of the more important provisions of these by-laws will detain us: 
The board of trust should meet annually on the first Wednesday in 
May; the president, with the concurrence of the executive committee, 
might call special meetings; the officers of the board should be elected 
annually; an executive committee, to be composed of the president, the 
secretary, the treasurer, and one member of the board from each of the 
codperating conferences, was empowered to act on all matters ad interim, 
subject to the ratification of the board; each codperating conference was 
given four representatives on the board, as already set forth. 
CONTROVERSY BETWEEN BISHOPS PIERCE AND MCTYEIRE. 
In the months of March, April, and May following the Memphis con- 
vention there appeared in the columns of the Nashville Christian Advo- 
cate a series of letters from Bishops Pierce and McTyeire—the one 
assailing, the other championing, the cause of the university. This 
battle of two giants no doubt reflected a controversy that was raging 
among the rank and file of the church. Jealousy on the part of the 
existing church colleges, antipathy to the special training of a theo- 
logical seminary, and a sort of prejudice against higher education in 
general—these gave animus to the opposition to the university. 
Bishop Pierce would have objected little to a church school in every 
city and in every circuit, but Bishop McTyeire thought otherwise. 
“The bane of our educational projects heretofore has been the want 
of concentration.” 
With Bishop Pierce the power of the church lay in a pious and godly 
ministry, were they lettered or unlettered. ‘The best preachers I ever 
heard had never been to college at all—hardly to school.” He scouted 
learned preaching and ridiculed the idea of preparing preachers by 
lectures and library. He feared that they would be lectured and 
molded until all individuality was gone. “ Itis my opinion that every 
dollar invested in a theological school will be a damage to Methodism. 
Had I a million I would not give a dime for such an object.” 
Bishop McTyeire admitted that the mission of the church primarily 
was to the masses, but it was to all others as well. People were not 
to be dropped as soon as tlrey became wealthy and refined, Southern

Methodism had no representative on the committee appointed to revise 
the translation of the Bible. Why? One reason was because it had 
no theological schools for the production of Biblical scholars, 
University education, said Bishop Pierce, “must be the outgrowth 
of an old, dense, rich population,” “High culture can never be general.” 
The common people can never reach it, Bishop McTyeire replied by 
admitting that high culture could “‘never be general.” But it ought 
to be made as general as possible; the higher forms of education nourish 
and control the lewer. 
COOPERATION OF THE COLLEGE OF BISHOPS. 
And thus the discussion went on until its further continuation was 
rendered a waste of words by the action of the college of bishops, May. 
9, 1872, consenting to locate the university whenever the sum of 
$500,000 should be pledged. This action was taken conformably to the 
Memphis resolutions and in response to a communication from the board 
of trust. The bishops were very fearful of damaging “existing colleges 
and universities,” and could enter into no official relations with Central 
University that would “discriminate between it and any and every other 
institution of the church.” As the question of theological schools was 
“in controversy” among their people, they proposed nothing that might 
“be construed into an expression” of their “collective opinion on the 
subject,” and stipulated that the theological department should be such 
as would be consistent with the action of the general conference of 
1870. Had every step in the founding of Vanderbilt University been 
taken in this reluctant half-hearted way, it would have been a long 
time a founding. 
ATTEMPT AND FAILURE TO RAISE $500,000. 
The Memphis convention had set $500,000 as the amount which must 
be secured before any department of the university could be opened. 
But the raising of this sum was found to be an impossible task. Even 
now when wealth and prosperity have returned to the South with an 
increase, her rich men do few great and generous deeds in the name of 
’ education. Much less could the South with her war wounds still 
unhealed respond to an appeal that presupposed the greatest health 
and vigor. Nevertheless Dr. A. L. P. Green, treasurer of the board of 
trust, with the help of four agents appointed from as many conferences, 
joined shortly after by Dr. R. A. Young as secretary and financial 
agent of the board, undertook to raise the $500,000. But itis said 
-that the agents did not collect enough cash to pay their own salaries. 
Twenty-six or twenty-seven thousand dollars given towards purchas- 
ing the site, mainly by citizens of Nashville, was the only considerable 
contribution made. This was of Dr. Young’s procuring.

CORNELIUS VANDERBILT AND VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY. 
As often befalls, help came from an unexpected quarter. At acalled 
meeting March 26, 1873, Bishop MeTyeire laid before the board of 
trust the following communication: 
New York, Mareh 17, 1878. 
To Bishop H. N. McTyerrs, of Nashville: 
I make the following offer through you to the corporation known as the Central 
University of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South: 
First. I authorize you to procure suitable grounds not less than from twenty to 
fifty acres properly located for the erection of the following work. 
Second. To erect thereon suitable buildings for the uses of the university. 
Third. You to procure plans and specifications for such buildings and submit 
them to me; and when approved the money for the foregoing objects to be furnished 
by me as it is needed. 
Fourth. The sum included in the foregoing items, together with the “endowment 
fund” and the “‘library fund,” shall not be less in the aggregate than five hun- 
dred thousand dollars; and these last two funds shall be furnished to the corpora- 
tion so soon as the buildings for the university are completed and ready to be used, 
The foregoing being subject to the following conditions: 
First. That you accept the presidency of the board of trust, receiving therefor a 
salary of three thousand dollars ($3,000) per annum and the use of a dwelling-house, 
free of rent, on or near the university grounds. 
Second. Upon your death or resignation the board of trust shall elect a president, 
Third. To check hasty and injudicions appropriations or measures, the president 
shall have authority, whenever he objects to any act of the board, to signify his 
objections in writing within ten days after its enactment; and no such act is to be 
valid unless upon reconsideration it be passed by a three-fourths vote of the board, 
Fourth. The amount set apart by me as an “endowment fund” shall be forever 
inviolate, and shall be kept safely invested, and the interest and revenue only used 
in carrying on the university. The form of investment which I prefer and in which 
Ireserve the privilege to give the money for said fund is in seven per cent first 
mortgage bonds of the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad Company, to 
be registered in the name of the corporation, and to be transferable only upon a 
special vote of the board of trust. 
Fifth. The university is to be located in or near Nashville, Tenn. 
Respectfully submitted. 
C. VANDERBILT. 
How Central University became the recipient of Commodore Van- 
derbilt’s bounty is told in an address delivered by Dr. L. C. Garland, 
chancellor of Vanderbilt University, on Founder’s day, May 27, 1876: 
In February, 1873, Bishop McTyeire spent, by invitation, a few weeks with the 
family of Mr. Vanderbilt in New York. Mr. Vanderbilt and the bishop had married 
cousins in the city of Mobile, who were very intimate with each other in their girl- 
hood, and thus was brought about an intimate relation between these two gentle- 
men. Tho bishop had from the first deeply interested himself in the founding of 
the proposed institution, but this visit had no reference thereto. He never did at 
any time solicit aid from Mr. Vanderbilt. It was very natural that, in general con- 
versations upon the condition of the South and the incidents therein transpiring, 
this enterprise, so important to the chureh and so dear to the bishop’s heart, should 
be mentioned. Finally, just before the bishops departure, Mr. Vanderbilt placed ia 
his hands the paper: proposing, upon certain conditions, to give the sum of $500,000 
to the institution.  
-P-A-G-E-152
  116 HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE. 
This account of the way in which Commodore Vanderbilt came to 
endow Central University is illuminated and supplemented by Mr. John 
T. McTyeire’s relation of the story as he heard it told by his father, the 
bishop: 
One evening, in conversation with Bishop McTyeire about the effects of the war 
upon the South and about the needs of that section, Commodore Vanderbilt expressed 
a desire to do something for the South, and asked the bishop to mention any plans 
he might have in mind that would redound to its good. The bishop mentioned, 
among other things, the Central University project, and he and the commodore dis- 
cussed it thoughtfully. The commodore did not show at the time a preference for 
any one of the proposed plans, but remarked on separating, ‘I shall think more of 
what you have said and refer to that subject again.” The next evening the bishop 
found on the center table in his bedroom a written proposition from the commodore 
designating the university idea as the one he proposed to adopt and naming the 
bishop as his choice for the head of the institution. ‘Later in the evening in dis- 
cussing this choice the commodore playfully remarked that if it was a railroad or 
steamship line he could adyise from experience what to do, but as it was a university 
the burden would have to fall on the bishop’s shoulders.” The commodore suggested 
that the bishop resign the episcopacy and devote his whole attention to the uni- 
versity, promising him a salary of $10,000 a year, with a house, for life. ‘This 
part of the proposition the bishop declined, but accepted the responsibility the 
undertaking involved and fixed his salary at a moderate sum and immediately pre- 
pared himself to begin the work.” 
The board of trust of Central University accepted the gift of Mr. 
Vanderbilt, and in token of their gratitude, without any suggestion 
from him, sought and obtained amendment to their charter changing 
the name of Central University to Vanderbilt University. In com- 
pliance with a condition of the gift, Bishop McTyeire was elected presi- 
dent of theboard. The agents of the board were requested to put forth 
every effort to obtain the additional half million of endowment. We 
know how futile were their efforts. 
The board of trust thought it best to use only the interest of Mr. 
Vanderbilt’s donation in providing grounds, buildings, and equipment; 
maintaining the principal intact as an endowment fund. But Mr. Van- 
derbilt could not brook the delay which this plan would have rendered. 
necessary. Accordingly, the work of building Vanderbilt University 
was entered upon forthwith. The bishop, on whom devolved the selec- 
tion of the site, located the university “on that parcel of ground situ- 
ated between the Hillsborough Pike and the extension of Broad street 
and known as the Litton or Taylor Hill, adjoining Boyd’s Hill.” The 
plat was an oblong square containing 74 acres of land. “Ground was 
broken for the main edifice of the university September 15, 1873, and 
the corner stone was laid April 28, 1874.” In October, 1875, Vander- 
bilt University was dedicated and her doors thrown open to students. 
It had been Mr. Vanderbilt’s intention to preserve $300,000 of his 
gift inviolate as a productive fund. But as the erection of buildings’ 
and the purchase of equipment proceeded, this fund was encroached 
upon more and more. It was seen that to keep it intact Mr. Vander-

bilt would have to increase his bounty. This he did. In March, 1874, 
he added $100,000 to his previous donation. As the work went on he 
steadily furnished the funds. By December 1, 1875, he had given 
$360,000, and $32,831.46 were still necessary to clear the university 
of debt, paying for grounds, buildings, books, and apparatus, and for 
salaries and incidental expenses up to date. On the 2d of Decem- 
ber he wrote President MeTyeire to draw on him for this sum as soon 
as the items could be paid off, and transmitted to the board of trust 
sixty bonds of $5,000 each, bearing 7 per cent interest, of the Lake Shore 
and Michigan Southern Railway Company due in 1903. This was the 
endowment fund. Mr. Vanderbilt had carried out his original intention 
of making it $300,000, but in doing so he had given the university 
$692,831.46 instead of $500,000. 
By a law of the university Founder’s Day has been made a perpet- 
ual holiday, to be ushered in by the playing of music and the ringing 
of the university bell. In the evening the founder’s medal in oratory 
is contested for. The first celebration of Founder’s Day, and the only 
one in Commodore Vanderbilt’s lifetime, took place May 27, 1876, the 
eighty-second anniversary of the commodore’s natal day. President 
McTyeire made a very happy occasional speech; trustees, faculties, and 
students telegraphed their greetings to the founder of the university, 
and Chancellor Garland delivered a discourse on his life and character 
and his benefactions to the university. 
In June, 1876, Bishop McTyeire was in New York on university 
business and visited Mr. Vanderbilt, then in his last illness. What 
happened is worth telling in Bishop McTyeire’s own words: 
On taking leaye to come home he [Mr. Vanderbilt] remarked it would likely be 
our last interview in this world—he had hoped to visit us here, but that must be 
given up now—sent his regards to the trustees and faculty and the students; wished 
that the institution might prosper and do good, and, still holding my hand, paused. 
“Could you not put off leaving for one day?” I replied that no urgent matter 
required me to keep my appointment in leaving just then if his wish were otherwise. 
“My purpose has been to add $300,000, making out the million. I have perfect con- 
fidence in my son; I know he will carry out my wishes; but there’s no telling what 
may happen from outside to delay and hinder; so you had better take it along with 
you. Ifyou will defer your trip till to-morrow we can have the papers fixed up.” 
That was the only time the subject of money was mentioned during a visit of days. 
The donation was in 7-per cent railway bonds, the same as composed 
the first donation, and was made and accepted on the condition that it 
should be a part of the endowment fund, the principal to be kept intact, 
the interest only to be used. 
Cornelius Vanderbilt died January 4, 1877, and was sincerely mourned. 
by the people of Nashville and Tennessee. The exercises of the univer- 
sity were suspended and faculties and students passed resolutions of 
sorrow and gratitude. Resolutions were passed also by a mass meet- 
ing of Nashville citizens, and by the general assembly of Tennessee, 
then in session. On the afternoon of Sunday, January 7, Bishop Me- 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
  118 HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE. 
Tyeire preached a memorial sermon to a crowded audience in the uni- 
versity chapel. 
‘When Mr, Vanderbilt transmitted the endowment fund to the board 
of trust he closed his letter to President MeTyeire with these words: 
And if it shall through its influence contribute even in the smallest degree to 
strengthening the ties which should exist between all geographical sections of our 
common country I shall feel that it has accomplished one of the objects that has led 
me to take an interest in it. 
The gift did noé fail of its purpose. “ The act, timely and delicately 
as munificently done, touched men’s hearts. It had no conditions that 
wounded the self-respect or questioned the patriotism of the recipients, 
The effect was widely healing and beneficent as against any sectional 
animosities which the late unhappy years had tended to create. A dis- 
tinguished statesman remarked, ‘Commodore Vanderbilt has done more 
for reconstruction than the acti second Congress.’” This feeling was 
prominent in the speeches made at the citizens’ meeting and in the 
general assembly on the occasion of Mr. Vanderbilt’s death. Said one 
of the speakers at the former, ‘‘ He came to us not as a military chief- 
tain or conqueror; he came not with fire and sword, desolating our 
homes, fearing down our temples; but,” ete. And in the houseSpeaker 
Taliaferro thus brought to a close the speeches on the adoption of the 
joint resolution of senate and house: 
With one stroke of the hand he rubbed ont all the party lines and the party dis- 
tinctions, and placed to the benefit of the children of Tennessee and the entire 
South the sum of $1,000,000, We see no statues erected in memory of Commodore 
Vanderbilt, but there aremonuments, such as stand in the vicinity of Nashville, which 
will live for generations to come. I most heartily indorse the resolutions and agree 
that Tennessce has done no more honor to Commodore Vanderbilt than she has done 
to herself. 
The sentiment has been most beautifully expressed in a college song: 
And when the time shall come again, 
When bitterness shall cease, 
The blushing South to the North shall say, 
‘Thou mayest if thou wilt,’ 
The ring for that bright wedding day 
Shall be our Vanderbilt. 
MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. OPENING OF THE LAW DEPARTMENT. 
As was related in the history of the University of Nashville, Vander- 
bilt University acquired a medical department April 21, 1874, by adopt- 
ing the medical department of the University of Nashville. The medi- 
cal department was thus the first department of the university put in 
operation, although the law department was nominally in existence 
for a year before the biblical and academic departments were opened. 
On the 29th of April, 1874, the board of trust elected the following 
able law faculty: William F, Cooper, dean; Ed Baxter, Jordan Stokes, 
Edward H. East, Thomas H. Malone, H. M. Spofford, A. O. P. Nicholson, 
 
-P-A-G-E-157
  
‘VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY. 119 
professors, and William B. Reese, junior professor. The department 
was to have rooms in the third story of the Southern Methodist Pub- 
lishing House. But the rooms were not ready, and many prospective 
students thought in consequence that the opening of ihe school would 
be postponed and did not come to Nashville at all. Some who came 
left, but four remained, and to thess Judge Reese, the junior professor, 
began to give instruction. The dean of the department and the presi- 
dent of the board of trust determined, in effect, to postpone for a year 
the opening of the law school, but it was left with Judge Reese and his 
pupils whether they should continue their work. They decided to go 
on, and Judge Reese was guaranteed a salary of $700. The judge car- 
ried one of his pupils (William V. Sullivan, of Oxford, Miss.) to gradu- 
ation. The others he prepared for the senior course. His class in- 
ereased in time from 4 to 6. . 
‘The board of trust now determined to reorganize the law school on 
a different plan. The old faculty resigned, and May 25, 1875, the execu- 
tive committee elected Thomas H. Malone, William B. Reese, and Ed. 
Baxter professors, naming Malone dean. The law department of Van- 
derbilt University was leased to these gentlemen for twenty-five years 
from May 27, 1875; the lessees engaging to maintain a law school equal 
to the other law schools of the United States. The terms of the agree- 
ment were as follows: The university to provide rooms in the univer- 
sity building; the law faculty to receive and enjoy all tuition fees and 
to be guaranteed a yearly salary of $1,000 each for the first three years; 
the university to publish catalogues of the law department annually, 
free of charge; the law faculty to have exclusive control of the law 
department, including the power to create, abolish, or change professor- 
ships, the university reserving the right to impeach and remove pro- 
fessors for just and sufficient cause; each lessee to have the power to 
appoint his suecessor in the lease, subject to the confirmation of the 
other lessees and of the university; if a lessee should die without 
appointing his successor, his personal representatives to do so, subject 
to confirmation as above; law students to be subject to university dis- 
cipline in like manner with the students of other departments; the 
university to appoint one of the lessees dean of the department, he to 
be a member of the university senate. 
In the announcement for 1875~76 the law faculty outline a two-year 
course of study and present their ideas on legal education and the 
methods they intend to follow. They can not, they assert, make law- 
yers in two years, neither can they teach the rules of local law or the 
special branches of the science. Their endeavor, therefore, will be to 
ground their pupils in the fundamental principles of law and to give to 
their minds a legal trend and training. Moot courts, assimilated to the 
procedure of actual courts, will be a feature of the instruction. Nash- 
ville, with the State library open to students, and with some State or 
Federal court always in session, offers superior advantages to the stu- 
dent of law.  
-P-A-G-E-158
  120 HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE. 
The professors of the Vanderbilt law faculty have been men actively 
engaged in the practice of law, and this fact necessarily has had much to 
do with shaping the character of the school. The first anouncement 
contained a passage vindicating and even commending this feature to 
the public: 
Every member of the faculty is engaged inthe vigorous practice of the profession, 
which they by no means propose to forego, and yet they have pledged themselves 
to each other and now assure the friends of the university that whatever time andla- 
bor may benecessary tosecure the highest success within the compass of their ability 
will surely be given to the law school. They hope, too, that coming daily to their 
lectures, fresh and heated from the contests of the bar, they may be able to impart 
to the study of the law a measure of the enthusiasm inseparably connected with the 
practice, and at all events they will keep prominently before the student the live 
law and practical questions of the day. 
PREPARATIONS FOR THE OPENING OF THE ACADEMIC AND BIBLICAL 
DEPARTMENTS. 
The medical and law departments had begun their work, but the 
biblical and academic departments, the latter the most important of 
all, the one to which the others are only accessories, were not yet 
organized. Preparations, however, were going rapidly forward. At 
the meeting of the board of trust in May, 1873, Bishop McTyeire and 
Dr. L. C. Garland were chosen a committee and charged with sundry 
important duties in the establishment and organization of the univer- 
sity. A building committee was appointed to act in conjunction with 
~ Bishop McTyeire. 
January, 1874, Bishop McTyeire presented to the board a letter from 
Dr. Garland as the report of the committee of two on the organization 
of the university. Dr. Garland advises the creation of four chairs in 
the biblical department, eleven in the department of literature, science, 
and philosophy, seven in the law department, and eleven in the medical 
department, and names the chairs in the first two departments. He 
favors the establishment in the present of all the schools that the uni- 
versity expects ever to operate, although it may not be able to operate 
them now. A high ideal must be set up as the goal of all effort. Un- 
less this is done people will believe the means of the university amply 
sufficient to attain all its ends. But, seeing some of its wheels idle, 
men of wealth will be prompted to furnish the motive power. Dr. Gar- 
land recommends, therefore, that where the university can not afford 
to hire a professor it employ instead a “teacher” at a lower salary. 
And, too, the work of some schools may be distributed among the pro- 
fessors of other schools. He urges that the public must not be disap- 
pointed in the character of the institution. It must be a university de 
facto as well as de jure. 
The board of trust at this time determined the salaries and the rela- 
tive rank of professors. Full professors were to receive the use of a 
dwelling and $2,500 a year; adjunct professors were to receive $1,500 a
-P-A-G-E-159
VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY, 121 
year! The salary of the chancellor was fixed at that of a full profes- 
sor, with $500 additional. These salaries were not always given, much 
depending on the amount of work attached to the chair and on the 
experience, reputation, and ability of the professor. 
Plenty of time was taken in the selection of men for the various 
chairs. Some upon whom the choice fell declined and others had to be 
found. The first appointments were made nearly two years, the last one 
less than a month, before the opening of the university. The faculties 
of the academic and the biblical departments finally stood:

The Vanderbilt profited by the experience and example of older insti- 
tutions. Her professors were drawn from their faculties and her cur- 
riculum was made out only after a careful study and comparison of 
their curricula. President McTyeire visited in person Union Theolog- 
ical Seminary, the University of Virginia, Yale, Cornell, and Syracuse. 
The physical and chemical apparatus were obtained in Europe, direct 
from the best manufacturers—not through agents, but by the personal 
selection of the professors of physics and chemistry, Profs. Garland 
and Lupton going abroad for the purpose. Prof. Lupton had been a 
pupil of Bunsen at Heidelberg. He now visited some of the finest 
laboratories in England, France, and Germany. His purchases were

the tuition fees, or a portion of them, are divided pro rata among the professors. Ad- 
junct professors usually receive the use of rooms in Wesley Hall.

made chiefly in Paris, London, Darmstadt, Pfortzheim, Heidelberg, 
Bonn, and Cologne. Dr. Garland’s purchases were made from Paris 
and London firms. In the school of natural history and geology the 
museum and cabinets contained several thousand specimens, some pur- 
chased abroad, others donated, and many belonging to the private col- 
lection of Prof. Safford. Ward’s complete series of casts was bought 
for the school. 
When the university was dedicated there were standing on the 
campus eight professors’ houses recently constructed; Wesley Hall 
appropriated to the use of divinity students; the main university, 
building; the observatory, unfinished; and a number of other struc- 
tures devoted to various purposes.

took place Sunday and Monday, October 3 and 4, 1875. On the first 
day, morning and afternoon, a sermon each was preached by Bishops 
Daggett and Wightman; by the former on “The Dynamics of Chris- 
tianity, or Its System of Moral Forces;” by the latter on “Christ the 
Center and Bond of the Universe;” and a dedication hymn and a dedi- 
cation ode were sung. On Monday morning, in the university chapel, 
a full-length portrait of Commodore Vanderbilt was unveiled. Gover- 
nor Porter then spoke briefly, welcoming the university to Tennessee, 
after which Rev. Charles F. Deems, D. D., delivered an address on the 
“Relations of the University to Religion.” Near the close of his 
address he took from the desk an envelope, opened it, and read the fol- 
lowing telegram: 
New Yorks, October 4. 
To Dr. CHartes F. DEEMS: 
Peace and good will to men. 
OC. VANDERBILT. 
Dr. Deems was followed by Rev. A. A. Lipscomb, D. D., lately chan- 
eellor of the University of Georgia, now professor in Vanderbilt 
University, on the “Relations of the University to General Education.” 
Next came the installation of the faculties. President McTyeire ad- 
dressed them shortly and delivered to Chancellor Garland the keys of 
the university. The chancellor responded briefly. A part of the inau- 
guration ode, composed by the Rev. Dr. Lipscomb, was then sung. 
After the reading of another telegram from Mr. Vanderbilt invoking 
on the institution the blessing of “the Great Governor of all things,” 
the exercises came to an end. 
SCHEME OF STUDIES AND DEGREES. 
A university pure and simple, receiving only college graduates and 
beginning where the college leaves off, would not have met the wants 
of the people and would have had little material on which to work.

A compromise was effected and a curriculum made out that overlapped. 
the junior and senior years of a college course and extended two years © 
into a university course. First and second college, first and second 
university the years were called. The assumption that the Vanderbilt 
curriculum was two years higher than the curriculum of the ordinary 
Southern college, though an overstatement perhaps, was not yet with- 
out its basis of truth. Some studies extended through the college 
course and through the first year of the university course, others ran 
the whole length of both courses, while still others belonged wholly to 
the university course. The following schedule, showing the number of 
hours per week assigned to the different classes in each school, will 
make the matter clear:

The class system, by which all who enter college together pursue 
the same studies at the same time and are carried to graduation to- 
gether, notwithstanding diversities of taste and differences of capacity, 
was discarded and the school system adopted. A student took up 
whatever branches he pleased in whatever order he pleased, provided 
always that he was prepared to enter upon the studies of his choice. 
He might, if he fancied, begin with moral philosophy and end with 
English. The system was in fact one form of the elective system. If 
a man did not care for a degree, the widest possible latitude was 
allowed; the only condition being that a reasonably large amount of 
work must be taken. But to applicants for degrees all discretion was 
denied, except as regarded the order in which studies might be pur- 
sued. And subsequently this discretion was refused for the first two 
years of the baccalaureate courses. The completion or the part com- 
pletion of certain schools was required. Four years, it was thought, 
were necessary for the attainment of the baccalaureate degrees and five 
years for that of the master’s degree. The degrees offered were—Aca- 
demic: Bachelor of philosophy (B. P.); bachelor of science (B. 8.); 
- bachelor of arts (B, A.), and master of arts (M, A.). Professional:
-P-A-G-E-162
  124 HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE. 
Civil engineer (C. E.); bachelor of laws (B. L.), and doctor of medicine 
(M. D.). The university degrees of mining engineer (M. E.) and doc- 
tor of philosophy (Ph. D.) were added the second year and later on 
professional degrees in theology, dentistry, and pharmacy. Below are 
given the requirements for degrees according to the register of 1876. 
Few changes were made in them until 1887, when the whole scheme of 
studies and degrees was swept away. These requirements should be 
read in connection with the schedule of hours on page 123. 
BACHELOR OF PHILOSOPHY (B. P.). 
Required: Proficiency [i. e., 60 per cent] in college course of English, modern lan- 
guages, mathematics, history; and in first year (university), history, physics, chem- 
istry, natural history, and geology; and in first and second year (university), moral 
philosophy. 
The college course of Latin may be substituted for one modern language. 
BACHELOR OF ARTS (B. A.). 
Required: Proficiency in college course of Latin, Greek, English, mathematics, and 
history; in first year (university), Latin, Greek, history, chemistry, natural history, 
and geology; and in first and second year (university), moral philosophy, physics, 
and astronomy, 
BACHELOR OF SCIENCE (B. 8.). 
Required: Proficiency in college course of mathematics, modern languages and 
English; in first year (university), mathematics and moral philosophy; and in first 
and second year (university), physics and astronomy, chemistry and natural history, 
and geology. 
The college course of Latin may be substituted for one modern language. 
MASTER OF ARTS (M. A.). 
To obtain this degree the candidate must be a graduate [i. ¢., must have completed 
the course, and that with a grade of 80 per cent] in eight of the following subjects 
and proficient in all: (1) Latin, (2) Greek, (3) mathematics, (4) English, (5) one 
modern language, (6) history, (7) physics, and astronomy, (8), chemistry, (9) moral 
philosophy, (10) natural history and geology. 
The college course in two modern languages may be substituted for the entire 
course in one. 
CIVIL ENGINEER (C.E.). 
Required: Proficiency in college course of English and modern languages, and 
graduation in pure mathematics, physics and astronomy, natural history and geol- 
ogy, and chemistry; and in addition the special course prescribed in the school of 
engineering. 
MINING ENGINEER (M. E.). 
This degree required a year’s study in addition to the work done for 
C. E., mostly in the laboratory, in the schools of chemistry and of nat- 
ural history and geology. As for the other degrees, so for this, a can-. 
didate must prepare an essay, an oration, or a thesis. 
 
-P-A-G-E-163
  
VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY. 125 
DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY (PH.D.). 
This degree was offered to baccalaureate graduates who for not less 
than two years after graduation should pursue any group of studies in 
a given collection of five groups, and who should stand the required 
examinations and present an acceptable thesis. 
SUBCOLLEGIATE CLASSES, 
The applicants for admission to the university during the earlier 
years of its history were many of them woftlly unprepared. Chan- 
cellor Garland declared at the close of the first year that had the rules 
been strictly enforced fully two-thirds of the applicants would have 
been rejected. Here was a dilemma. The Vanderbilt had hoped to 
be a university, and yet the young men who came to her were not fitted 
for her lowest college classes. She was confronting a condition with 
which she had to deal; there was no evading it. The opening of a 
grammar school under the supervision of the university had been an- 
nounced. This was not done, but “subclasses,” taught by instructors 
and fellows and even professors, were established instead. These 
classes stood in close relations to the college classes, were in fact merely 
accessory thereto, and could easily be abolished when there was no 
longer any necessity for them. 
CREATION AND. HISTORY OF THE DENTAL DEPARTMENT. 
June 10, 1879, Vanderbilt University added to her other depart-- 
ments a dental department by contract with a number of gentlemen 
who became the faculty of the new department. These gentlemen, 
with their respective chairs, were: William H. Morgan, M.D., D.D. 8., 
dean, clinical dentistry and dental pathology; James C. Ross, D. D. 8., op- 
erative dentistry and dental hygiene; Robert R. Freeman, M. D., D, D.8., 
mechanical and corrective dentistry; Thomas A, Atchison, M. D., ma- 
teria medica and special therapeutics; John R. Buist, M. D., oral sur- 
gery and surgical pathology; David R. Stubblefield, m. D., anatomy 
and physiology; Nathaniel T. Lupton, LL. D., chemistry and metal- 
lurgy, and Robert W. Steger, M. D., chemistry and microscopy. 
By the terms of the contract the faculty were to provide rooms for 
the department at their own expense, the university appropriating _ 
$1,000 towards equipment. Tuition fees should go to the professors in 
full compensation for their services; while matriculation fees were set 
apart for expenditure on library and apparatus. Judging from the 
complaints made to the board of trust, the dental faculty did not find 
their contract profitable. In 1889 the department moved into new 
quarters in the just constructed law and dental building on Cherry 
street. The university charged for these new quarters $1,200 a year, 
and required the faculty to hire their own janitor and do their own light- 
ing and heating. The building was erected with endowment funds,
-P-A-G-E-164

126 HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE. 
and the university authorities claimed that the rooms could not be let 
to the dental department free of rent without perverting the purpose 
of those funds. Moreover, by the original contract the dental faculty 
had agreed to provide rooms itself. The faculty demurred to the re- 
quirements of the university and the disagreement grew intense. But 
-& compromise was made and the threatened rupture of relations averted. 
The original contract, however, was modified little and the dental 
faculty still complain of its provisions. 
The dental department occupies four stories in the rear end of the mag- 
nificent law and dental building, The extensive museum of the medical 
department and the privileges of lectures in any department of the 
university are open to students. Patients in abundance are procured. 
Last year nearly five thousand operations were performed in the build- 
ing. The regular course begins October 1 and continues until the 
fourth Wednesday in February. It is preceded by a preliminary 
course in September. The Vanderbilt School of Dentistry conforms to 
the requirements for graduation of the National Association of Dental 
Faculties, Heretofore attendance on only two full courses has been 
necessary, but beginning with 1891~92 three courses will be required. 
‘The fees for a course are nearly covered by $115. 
The faculty is at present constituted as follows: Henry W. Morgan, 
M. D., D. D. 8., dean, professor of operative dentistry and dental hygiene; 
James C. Ross, D. D. 8., emeritus professor of operative dentistry and 
dental hygiene; William H. Morgan, M. D., D.D. s., professor of clinical 
dentistry and dental pathology; Robert R. Freeman, M. D., D. D. 8., 
professor of mechanical and corrective dentistry; Thomas A. Atchison, 
| M. D., professor of*materia medica and special therapeutics; D. R. Stub- 
blefield, A. M., M. D., D. D. 8., professor of chemistry and metallurgy; 
Ambrose Morrison, M. D., professor of anatomy and physiology; Orville 
H. Menees, M. D., professor of aural surgery, histology, and pathology. 
Demonstrators: A. P. Johnstone, D. D. 8., demonstrator of operative 
and mechanical dentistry; 8. S. Crockett, mM. D., demonstrator of 
anatomy. 
The matriculation books of the department show a rapid growth of 
attendance. From the beginning in 1879~80 till now the yearly enroll- 
ment has been 15, 20, 33, 27, 28, 55, 76, 80, 76, 96, 100, 135. The total 
number of graduates has been 277. 
CREATION AND HISTORY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PHARMACY, 
The Vanderbilt School of Pharmacy dates back to anagreement made 
April 16, 1879, between the university and Drs. Thomas A. Atchison 
and William G, Ewing, Drs. Atchison and Ewing engaging to fill, the 
one the chair of materia medica and toxicology, the other the chair of 
the theory and practice of pharmacy; while the university agreed to 
furnish professors for the chairs of chemistry and of botany and miner- 
alogy. The annual sessions of the school were to be five months in
-P-A-G-E-165
  
VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY. 127 
length, and a tuition fee of $50 was to be charged, of which one-fourth 
should go to Prof. Atchison and one-fourth to Prof. Ewing. If either 
party should decide to withdraw from the arrangement, five months’ 
notice was to be given the other party. The arrangement continued 
in force until 1888, Instruction in chemistry and in natural history 
and geology was given by the professors and instructors in those schools 
of the academic department. In 1884 Dr. Atchison retired from the 
faculty; Dr. Ewing took his place and Dr. J. C. Wharton was elected 
to the chair vacated by Dr. Ewing. 
To obtain the degree graduate in pharmacy (PH. G.) required attend- 
ance upon two full courses of lectures and a thesis on some subject in 
materia medica, chemistry, pharmacy, or some branch of science imme- 
diately connected therewith. A very important condition of gradua- 
tion was added in 1886, namely, that a student must have four years’ 
practical experience in a drugstore, including the time spent in attend- 
ance upon lectures and in laboratory work. If the candidate had not 
had the requisite experience, a certificate, exchangeable for a diploma 
when the requirement should have been met, was to be given him. 
Prior to 1888 there were no entrance examinations to the pharmacen- 
tical department, and the students were not on the whole the equal of 
the academic students in point of intelligence and previous education. 
The department required of them no educational qualifications for 
admission, and added nothing to their educational qualifications beyond 
a certain amount of professional knowledge. In order to elevate the 
charaeter of the department by increasing as well the general mental 
as the professional excellence of its graduates, the changes of 1888 
were introduced. These changes consisted in the institution of entrance 
examinations; the addition to the course of elementary French or 
German, Latin, and physics; the lengthening of the session from five 
months to nine months; the abolition of the rule requiring a thesis of 
a candidate for graduation; and the creation of a post-graduate degree 
master of pharmacy (PH. M.). 
These innovations were a radical departure from the policy and 
practice of most professional schools, and the department lost patron- 
age. Latin, French, and German were dropped from the course in 
1889, and English substituted. In a year this went the way of the 
others, and only physics was left of the studies added to the course 
two years before. But the entrance examinations in English, history, 
arithmetic, and geography, and the nine months’ sessions were retained. 
In 1890 Profs, Ewing and Wharton resigned, and E. A. Ruddiman, 
PH. M., was elected instructor in materia medica and pharmacy, his 
whole time to be given to the university. The attendance of students 
from the establishment of the department in 1879 until 1891, inclusive, 
has been, for the various years in their order, 12, 17, 23, 20, 25, 26, 39, 
46, 44, 28, 15, 22. The number of graduates, including those who have 
received certificates exchangeable for diplomas, has been 95,
-P-A-G-E-166

The department of pharmacy is correlated with the academic schools 
of chemistry, and of natural history and geology. The latter is domi- 
eiled in science hall; the former, together with the pharmacy depart- 
ment, occupies the whole of the basement of the main building. Where 
possible, time and labor are saved by combining the work of the two 
schools and of the department. The best advantages the university 
affords in the way of scientific laboratories and apparatus are thus 
enjoyed by the students of pharmacy, and many of the graduates are 
ranking high as practical pharmacists and manufacturing chemists. 
HISTORY OF THE MEDICAL DEPARTMENT SINCE 1874. 
The origin and early history of the medical department of the Uni- 
versity of Nashville (since 1874 the medical department of the Univer- 
sity of Nashville and Vanderbilt University) have been fully treated 
in the history of the University of Nashville. Only a few words need 
be said of its later history. The faculty, desiring to build a hospital 
in connection with the medical college, secured from the University of 
Nashville an extension of their lease until 1905. A building with a 
capacity of 250 patients was erected in 1875 immediately adjoining the 
college building. It has recently been enlarged, remodeled, and refitted. 
Its clinical facilities are under the exclusive control of the medical 
faculty. Not far from the college is the City Charity Hospital, the 
privileges of whose wards and lecture rooms are accorded the faculty. 
The regular course of instruction is five months in length, beginning 
about the Ist of October and ending about the1st of March. A pre- 
liminary course is given in September. Candidates for graduation 
must have attended two full courses of lectures, and have studied medi- 
cine three years under a regular practitioner, including the time spent 
at the college. The faculty have under consideration a graded scheme 
of studies, covering three instead of two courses of five months each. 
The necessary fees for a full course are $115. In 1875 the composition 
of the faculty was as follows: Thomas Menees, M. D., dean, professor 
of obstetrics; James M. Safford, mM. D., professor of chemistry; Paul F. 
Eyes, M. D., professor of operative and clinical surgery; William T. 
Briggs, M. D., professor of the principles and practice of surgery; 
Thomas L. Maddin, M. D., professor of the institutes and practice of 
medicine; William L. Nichol, M. D., professor of the diseases of women 
and children and of clinical medicine; Van S. Lindsley, M. D., profes- 
sor of physiology; Thomas A. Atchison, M. D., professor of materia 
medica and therapeutics; Thomas O. Summers, jr., M. D., professor of 
anatomy and histology; John H. Callender, m. D., professor of psycho- 
logical medicine; Charles S. Briggs, Mm. D., demonstrator of anatomy. 
In 1891 the faculty stood thus: 
Thomas Menees, M. D., Dean, Professor of Obstetrics. 
William T. Briggs, M. Dy Professor of Surgery. 
Thomas L. Maddin, u. D., Professor of Principles of Medicine and Gen- 
eral Pathology.

The enrollment of students in this department of the university be- 
tween 1876 and 18911 has been for the years in their order, 115, 171, 
192, 226, 239, 308, 281, 203, 202, 203, 211, 210, 201, 231, 279, 249, The 
number of graduates has been 1,513 (1875-1891). 
HISTORY OF THE LAW DEPARTMENT SINCE 1875. 
The law department had 25 students in 1875~76. The following 
figures show the annual enrollment since that year: 26, 31, 39, 44, 53, 
35, 37, 28, 35, 28, 34, 27, 37, 50, 44. Two hundred and twenty-four men. 
altogether have received the diploma of the school. The guaranty of. 
$1,000 a year to each of the professors for three years cost the univer- 
sity something over $3,000. The original faculty remained unchanged 
until 1882, when Prof. Malone retired on account of ill health. He con- 
tinued, however, as emeritus professor to be dean of the faculty. His 
place as teaching professor was taken by William A. Milliken. In 1887 
Prof. Milliken resigned and Chancellor Andrew Allison, of the Nash- 
ville chancery division, assumed the chair. In 1890 he gave way to 
Prof. Malone, who, restored to health, now resumed his duties, and the 
original faculty was again seated on the pedagogic throne. Corpora- 
tion law, once attached to Prof. Baxter’s chair, is now taught by Prof. 
Malone. The moot court feature is very prominent in the Vanderbilt 
Law School. Prof. Baxter devotes most of his time to this work. The 
three professorships are: Equity jurisprudence, corporation, and com- 
mon law, Prof. Malone; commercial, statute, and constitutional law, 
'The author was unable to ascertain the attendance for 187475.

rof. Reese;' and the law of evidence, pleading, and practice, Prof. Bax- 
ter. Wilbur I’, Barclay is librarian, secretary of the faculty, and assist- 
ant to Prof. Baxter. 
The quarters of the law department continued to be in University 
Hall, on the campus, until 1889, when they were changed to the new 
Jaw and dental building on Cherry street, in the heart of the city. 
This change brings the department nearer the courts and the libraries, 
while students may still enjoy many of the advantages of the univer- 
sity—the library, the gymnasium, and the literary societies. Notwith- 
standing, the removal necessarily tends to divoree the law department 
from the departments on the campus. 
The law library, consisting of 6,000 volumes, contains tho private libraries of the 
late Francis B. Fogg (kindly donated by Godfrey M. Fogg, esq.), those of Profs. 
Reese and Baxter, the large library of the Nashville Bar Association, and the splendid 
collection of Hon. William F. Cooper, now of Boston, Mass. These books were 
selected with very great care by Judge Cooper during his long and honorable career 
at the bar, as chancellor of the Nashville chancery division, and as one of the judges 
of the supreme court of Tennessee, and cover the whole literature of equity juris- 
prudence and practice. The library also contains a number of valuable volumes 
contributed by other friends of the university, besides a carefully chosen line of the 
best elementary works, selected by a committee composed of Judges Cooper and 
East and the professors and librarian of the law school. Additions are constantly 
being made, including the reports of ail the States and of England, as they issue 
from the press. 
The work of the law school is comprised in two courses, a junior and 
a senior course, but the lectures and recitations are so arranged that 
the courses can both be carried on at once. As it is not beyond the 
capacity of the man of ordinary intelligence to carry on both courses at 
once, a half, perhaps more, of the students take them in one year. 
Quite recently three senior scholarships covering the cost of tuition 
for one year ($100) have been founded to induce students to devote 
two years to the courses. They are awarded to the three students 
making the highest grades in the junior course. The holders of the 
scholarships act in rotation as clerks of the moot court. The attend- 
ants upon law lectures appear to number more alumni of the academic 
department than formerly and the character of the graduates seems to 
be improving in consequence. 
HISTORY OF THE BIBLICAL DEPARTMENT. 
Wesley Hall, the home of the biblical department, was built in 1880, 
out of the $150,000 donated by William H. Vanderbilt the previous 
year. The old home of the department was also called Wesley Hall. 
Wesley Hall is five stories high, including the basement, a brick with 
cut-stone trimmings. 
The form of the building is such as to give the greatest amount of space with the 
maximum degree of exterior illumination, being that of two parallel transverse sec-

chair ad interim.

tions, 104 by 40 feet and 130 by 35 feet, respectively, connected by a longitudinal sec- 
tion 110 by 50 feet. 
The basement is occupied by kitchen, dining room, storage rooms, 
éte.; the other floors by library, chapel, lecture rooms, and living rooms. 
The largest and best appointed living rooms are held by professors, and. 
some rooms are occupied by fellows and instructors. For several years, 
when the department was not so full as it is now, students belonging 
to departments other than the biblical lived in Wesley Hall, but their 
presence tending to disorderliness, a8 was thought, the privilege was 
withdrawn. Each room is furnished with table, chairs, wash stand, 
bedstead, mattress, and blankets. Other articles are provided by the 
student himself. The messing system obtains, whereby board is brought 
down to $9 or $10 a month, or even lower. As biblical students pay no 
tuition fee, but only library and matriculation fees ($15), necessary 
expenses are small. 
Not till 1885 did the biblical department require of applicants for 
admission any literary or educational qualification. The call to preach 
the gospel was deemed qualification enough. The academic depart- 
ment was open to biblical students, but they seem not to have received 
the proper encouragement to enter it and supply the deficiencies of 
their education. Dr. Summers, dean of the department, was appar- 
ently oblivious to the disastrous effects of this policy and upheld it 
steadily, although in his report to the board of trust in 1881 he was 
forced to admit that it might be well if the church authorities would 
give their young men an academic training before sending them to the 
biblical department of the Vanderbilt. Many took up the study of 
theology, one of the most subtle and abstruse of sciences, who did not 
possess a common-school education. Some, very naturally, could not 
progress at all and had to leave the university. Others struggled 
through and then perhaps entered the subcollegiate classes of the 
academic department. In any event this forced and ill-timed theolog- 
ieal drill could hardly have been expected to work good results, And 
it did not. Men holding the diploma of one of the departments of the 
Vanderbilt, and yet mayhap lacking in the rudiments of an English 
education, brought the university into discredit. Finally better coun- 
sels prevailed. President MeTyeire expressed in these words the 
altered views and purposes of the university authorities: 
Iam convinced that in running on experimental lines we have made some mis- 
takes which need correction. It has come to be my deliberate judgment that a 
young man with only a common-school education who can give but two yéars to 
preparation for the ministry had best give those years to the academic depart- 
ment. 
Upon this idea the biblica: department was in 1885 reorganized. 
The rule now is to admit no one to Wesley Hall who can not enter the 
lowest classes of the academic department. If he can enter these 
classes he is received and enrolled as a theological candidate, with all 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
  
132 HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE. 
the rights, privileges, and obligations of a full-fleaged theologue. But 
not until he has completed the sophomore year of one of the courses 
leading to a bachelor’s degree, with the privilege of dropping any of 
the prescribed studies and substituting others, under the advice and 
approbation of the chancellor, can he becomé a theological student 
proper. Meanwhile he is instructed at least once a week in the ele- 
ments of theology. In lieu of this academic work at the university the 
completion of the sophomore year at any reputable college or a suc- 
cessful examination upon the sophomore studies of the academic depart- 
ment willbe accepted. The graduates of reputable institutions are of 
course admitted without question. 
The classical course of three years includes Hebrew and Greek; the 
English course of two years omits them. In 1881 the degree of bach- 
elor of sacred theology (S. T. B.) was created and offered to full-course 
men who were also B. A. graduates, and even to those who did not hold 
a bachelor’s degree, provided they could satisfy the faculty of general 
culture equivalent thereto. In18868. T. B. gave way to B. D. (bachelor 
of divinity); B. D. was made conferrable on B. A. graduates only. For 
the classical course students not degree men receive diplomas of gradu- 
ation, and for the English course parchment certificates. 
Although these radical changes had to be wrought in a spirit of mod- 
eration and conservatism, and although the pill had to be sweetened 
to lessen its great bitterness, the results of the reorganization have 
been most gratifying. The hopes once entertained that the biblical 
department would become a sort of postgraduate school for the colleges, 
at least the Methodist colleges of the country, a central theological 
seminary for the whole church, are, it would appear, on the high road 
to realization. Take the year 1890-91. There were répresented this 
year twenty-four colleges, though not all of the best perhaps, and 
twenty-seven conferences, nearly every conference in the church. Only 
21 of the 71 students were theological candidates, while of the 50 
theological students proper 35 were possessors of academic degrees, 
Many of these college graduates from far and near the university has 
attracted, like other theological seminaries, by the offer of scholarships. 
For the past two years a number of hundred-dollar scholarships have 
been awarded to meritorious college graduates in need of assistance. 
Ten were given the first year, eighteen last year, and twenty-three will 
be given this year. A fellowship, formerly open to graduates of the 
department, latterly only to B. D. graduates, secures the residence of a 
postgraduate student of theology. He is expected to pursue post- 
graduate studies, and, “if necessary, to teach not exceeding two hours 
daily under the direction of the faculty.” 
Dr. R. A. Young served as secretary and financial agent of the uni- 
versity from 1873 to 1882. Aside from raising some $27,000 from citi- 
zens of Nashville and others towards purchasing the university site, 
he devoted most of his attention to securing an endowment for the bib- 
 
-P-A-G-E-173

lical department. He directed his appeals in particular to some of the 
cobperating conferences. By 1877, $122,451.66 had been subscribed in 
notes, stocks, bonds, and other assets. This included the Atkinson be- 
quest of $40,000, left in trust to the bishops of the church by Mrs. Sarah 
BH. Atkinson, of Memphis. One hundred and twenty thousand dollars 
is stil about the size of the fund. It yields, as a whole, less than 4 per 
cent, the annual income being approximately $4,500. Fifty thousand 
dollars of it are in subscription notes, on which the return is little or 
nothing. This fund is called the sustentation fund, because it is used 
to assist needy theological candidates and students. Aid is not usually 
extended beyond the defrayment of board, and it is not rendered gratis, 
but is given in the form of aloan. The note of the recipient is taken, 
which he is expected to pay as soon as practicable, remitting in small 
suns if not able to remit inlarge ones. Prior to 1888 the notes bore no 
interest, but now they draw interest at 6 per cent if not paid within 
four years after the student leaves the university. The money returned 
by old students goes to swell the fund whose benefits they have en- 
joyed. Lending to poor students is not the only use to which the sus- 
tentation fund is put. It supports the fellowship and the scholarships 
of the department. 
In 1876-77 Rey. Thomas J. Dodd, D. D., was made professor of He- 
brew and ecclesiastical history. Save this addition to their number 
and the election of John J. Tigert assistant instructor in 1881 the origi- 
nal faculty of the bibilical department remained unchanged until the 
death of Dr. Summers and the election of Dr. Granbery to the episco- 
pacy, both in May, 1882. Dr. Shipp succeeded Dr. Summers in the 
deanship. In 1883 Rev. W. F. Tillett, A. m., was elected adjunct pro- 
fessor of systematic theology and ecclesiastical history. A year after- 
wards hewas made a full professor. At the reorganization of the de- 
partment in 1885 all the professorships were declared vacant. The 
chairs were not all filled again until April, 1886, when Rev. W. W. 
Martin, M. A., B. D., of De Pauw University, was elected professor of 
Hebrew and old Testament exegesis. The new faculty stood: Rev. W. 
F. Tillett, M. A., D. D., dean, professor of systematic theology; Rev. 
Gross Alexander, B. A., B. D., professor of Greek and New Testament 
exegesis; Rey. H. E. Hoss, M.A., D. D., professor of biblical and eccle- 
siastical history and homiletics, and Rev. W. W. Martin, M. A., B. D., 
professor of Hebrew and Old Testament exegesis. An instructor in 
music and one in elocution completed the teaching force. In 1890 
Prof. Hoss resigned and assumed the editorship of the Nashville Chris- 
tian Advocate, the principal organ of thechurch. Rev. A. Coke Smith, 
M. A. D. D., of Wofford College, was elected professor of practical the- 
ology, the chair of Prof. Hoss being left unfilled. Before the reorgan- 
ization of 1885 the theological faculty met with the academic faculty. 
Thereafter, by order of the board of trust, they met separately. The 
dean of the theological faculty is, however, ex officio a member of the
-P-A-G-E-174
  134 HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE, 
academic faculty as well as vice-chancellor of the university. The en- 
rollment of students in the biblical department from the opening of 
the university to the present is given in the following figures: 25, 59, 
53, 49, 51, 70, 69, 74, 54, 50, 34, 31, 32, 25, 35, 50. To these may be added 
the theological candidates studying in the academic department. Be- 
ginning with 1885-86 they numbered in the respective years 10, 40, 34, 
27,19, 21. There have been 57 graduates in the two-years English 
course and 36 in the three-years classical course. Twelve men have 
received the degree of B. D. and one the degree of S. T. B. 
_ HISTORY OF THE ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT, - 
A degree in civil engineering was offered from the beginning, and in 
the second year a school of engineering was made one of the codrdinate 
schools of the academie department. But there was no professor of 
engineering, and no professional instruction was given until 1879. In 
1879 Olin H. Landreth, M. A., 0. E., was elected professor of engineering. 
The next year and succeeding years Prof. Landreth was allowed one or 
more assistants. The school ere long attained such importance that it 
was erected into a department, Prof. Landreth being made dean. This 
was done in 1886 and completed the organization of the university upon 
the plan of departments, each with its faculty and dean. The dean of 
the engineering department was made ex officio a member of the aca- 
demic faculty, and it was enacted that the action of this faculty might 
be taken in lieu of the action of the engineering faculty and should be 
considered equivalent thereto whenever it was applicable to the engi- 
neering department. 
In August, 1879, William H. Vanderbilt donated $150,000 to the 
university. With a portion of this gift Science Hall was built and 
supplied with a complete equipment of engineering apparatus. 
This building has a central location on the grounds, being situated midway be- 
tween University Hall and Wesley Hall. It has three stories and basement, with a 
front of 80 feet and a depth of 90 feet. In the basement is the testing laboratory 
of the engineering department and the laboratory of the school of mining engineer- 
ing. The civil engineering lecture room and engineering museum are on the next 
floor, together with drawing and computing room and offices. Over this are the 
lecture and laboratory rooms of the School of Natural History and Geology, the 
Natural History Museum, and cabinets of geology, the whole occupying the second 
story of the building. The general drawing rooms occupy the mansard story, each 
room being lighted by a skylight and windows on three sides. 
This is Science Hall as it is to-day. Before the construction of the _ 
Hall of Mechanical Engineering in 1888, the school of Mechanical Engi- 
neering, with all its appurtenances, and the steam plant of the university 
heating system were located in Science Hall. The Hall of Mechanical 
Engineering “‘is situated near the Broad street gate of the campus, and 
is of brick construction. The front portion (38 by 63 feet) is two stories 
high, with basement and high attic, and is handsomely ornamented 
with sandstone and terra-cotta trimmings. It contains the recitation
-P-A-G-E-175
  
VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY. 135 
and drawing rooms of the School of Mechanical Engineering. The rear 
portion (53 by 83 feet) is of ‘slow-burning mill construction,” and is 
two stories high. The machine shop (50 by 56 feet), engine and wash 
rooms are on the first floor, and the carpentry and pattern-making 
shops (50 by 80 feet) on the second. The wing (83 by 43 feet) is of one 
story, with monitor roof, and is entirely fireproof. It contains the 
forge shop and foundry (40 by 40 feet), storerooms, pump and. boiler 
rooms, in which is located the steam plant of the university heating 
system, which supplies steam to the various buildings and for motive 
power. Attached to this wing is the coal house (43 by 48 feet).” 
This addition to the facilities of the engineering department was due 
to Cornelius Vanderbilt, the grandson of the founder, who in January, 
1888, gave $20,000 for the enlargement of the department. This sum 
was not enough, and the university had to supplement it with a large 
amount. 
Prof. Landreth, when he took charge of the School of Engineering, 
dropped the degree of mining engineer, advanced the degree of civil 
engineer one year, and substituted bachelor of engineering (B. E.) . 
‘for the old C. E. The new B. EH. and the old ©. E. course comprised 
nearly all the studies in the B.S. course, and in addition thereto a 
year’s work in studies purely scientific and professional, so that the 
engineering course was much heavier to carry than the academic 
course, which was heavy enough. The degree of C. E. was given a 
B. E, graduate on the completion of one of three courses—a course in 
constructive engineering, a course in geodesy, or a course in mining 
engineering. Later the choice of one.in four instead of one in three 
courses, was offered, but the candidate was required to have engaged 
previously for not less than three months in the active practice of some 
branch of engineering in the line of the course chosen. 
In 1887 the whole scheme of studies in both the academic and engi- 
neering departments was altered very materially. At the first perfect 
freedom had been allowed students in respect of the order in which 
they prosecuted the studies leading to a degree. It was afterwards 
found best to restrict this freedom in the case of students studying for 
baccalaureate degrees, permitting it the last two years of the course, 
but prescribing the order of studies for the first two years. Now the 
class system with its four years of prescribed work, modified by the 
introduction of electives, was adopted. The elective feature differed 
radically in the two departments, as will be seen. In the engineering 
department the course of studies for the first three years was made the 
same for all students—a general course essential to a broad and thor- 
ough training in any branch of the profession. After the third year 
this general course divided into specialized courses in civil, mechanical, 
and mining engineering. B. EH. was reached at the end of the fourth 
year and ©. E. at the end of the fifth year, whichever special course 
was taken. The three months of professional work were still retained  
-P-A-G-E-176
  1386 HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE. 
as a condition for the attainment of C, H- In 1889 the general course 
was shortened one year and the special courses lengthened correspond- 
ingly. The degree of B. E. was reached as before at the end of four 
years; but for C. E. at the end of five years was substituted C. E., M. 
E. (mechanical engineer), or E. M. (mining engineer), according to the 
special course followed. Two years later the general course was short- 
ened to one year; so that now the studies of the three schools of engi- 
neering diverge after the first year, though four years are still required 
for the degree of B. E. and five years for the full degrees of C. E., M. 
E.,and E.M. A thesis is required for all engineering degrees. And 
the requirement is nota dead letter, but is enforced. The new curricu- 
Jum looks less to general culture than did the old and more to techni- 
eal and professional training. The curriculum is hardly as difficult as 
it was, hardly as great a terror to young men aspiring to a diploma. 
The engineering courses of Vanderbilt University will bear compari- 
son with those of any school inthe South. Nay, it is believed that they 
are superior to those of any other Southern school in their searching 
- requirements and their comprehensive training. Degrees which are 
awarded elsewhere in two or three years are won here only after four 
or five years. Consequently, few men have reached graduation, but 
upon these few has been stamped the stamp of excellence. 
In July, 1883, Mr. William H. Vanderbilt added $100,000 to the endow- 
ment of the university. Bishop McTyeire had had special reference in 
asking for the donation to the growing wants of the engineering depart- 
ment. Through its aid a course in manual technology was established 
during the session of 1883-84, having as its purpose to teach “the theo- 
retical principles underlying all constructive operations and trades as 
well as the art of manual construction.” The course of two years com- 
prehended the exercises of the shop and the instruction of the class 
room. Mathematics, through trigonometry, elementary physics and 
mechanics, drawing, and shopwork were taught. Tuition was made 
free: 
In the winter of 188889, manual technology took up its abode in the 
Hall of Mechanical Engineering. Here its quarters were commodious 
and its appliances and facilities abundant. The course was extended 
and broadened somewhat and fees the samc as the regular engineering 
fees were charged. At the same time scholarships affording free tuition 
were established in both classes, one for every 5 students or fraction 
thereof. 
The School of Manual Technology possesses the advantages of com- 
petent instructors and a splendid plant. The Vanderbilt has kept 
abreast of the times in manual training and it is matter of regret that 
the opportunities she offers are not more eagerly embraced. The num- 
ber of students is not whatit should be, and a large proportion of these 
take the course merely as a preparation for a course in engineering. 
Though serving this purpose well, the manual training course is fairly 
complete in itself and looks to ends and aims of its own.

Prof. Landreth is much interested in securing a good road system for 
Tennessee, and has established a course in road-building, extending 
from February 1 to April1. Free instruction is offered to one official 
from every county in the State, to be appointed by the chairman of the 
county court. 
A school of architecture is badly needed, but in the present condition 
of the university’s finances none can be established. There is no such 
school in the South. 
The shops and laboratories of the engineering department are well 
equipped with machinery and apparatus, and here and in the field the 
student spends a good portion of his time in testing and applying the 
theories of the class room. Occasional visits are made to manufacto- 
ries and other places of professional interest in and about Nashville, 
and sometimes to distant points. Indeed, from the first the art as well 
as the science of engineering has been taught. The professors of the 
department doing a certain amount of outside professional work, but not 
so as to interfere with the performance of their academic duties, have been 
enabled to mix with theory the leaven of practice. An important fea- 
ture has been the working out of definite and complete “ projects” after 
the manner of the French polytechnic schools. Among them may be 
mentioned two separate investigations for and designs of two bridges 
across the Cumberland River at Nashville; three different plans for 
reclaiming from river overflow a 200-acre tract in the heart of Nashville; 
a detailed design for the development of a large water power in southern 
Tennessee; and a series of investigations of several important proper- 
ties of the leading hydraulic cements of the United States. 
Prior to 1888 there had been instructors and assistants in the depart- 
ment, but only one professor. That year Charles L. Thornburg, ¢. E., 
PH. D., instructor in civil engineering, was made adjunct professor of 
civil engineering and practical astronomy, and William T. Magruder, 
M. E., instructor in mechanical engineering, was made adjunct pro- 
fessor of mechanical engineering. The teaching force for 1888~89 
consisted of Profs. Landreth, Thornburg, and Magruder and of five 
instructors in mining and metallurgy, in manual technology, physics, 
mathematics, and English, and in machine and wood shops. The most 
important change made since then Was the abolition of the instructor- 
ship in mining and metallurgy. The dean of the department and the 
professor of chemistry give all of the instruction now given and the 
“number of students has in consequence diminished. 
The register for 187980 was the first one to record separately the 
number of engineering students. There were 23 that year. Since 
then the attendance for the successive years has been 23, 29, 27, 37, 
37, 26, 36, 56, 48, 49, 55. Twenty B. E.’s, six C. E.’s, and one E. M. have 
been conferred. The number of graduates has been small for two 
reasons. Of one, the rigorous requirements for graduation, we have 
spoken. The other reason is the demand on the department for engi-

neers. Opportunities of going to work at good salaries have drawn 
many students away from their studies before they had completed 
them. In his report to the board of trust in June, 1887, the dean 
said, speaking of the success of his students in obtaining work: 
Fourteen havo been offered and have accepted good positions while atthe univer- 
sity within tho past two months and every member of the present graduating class 
of engineers has received an appointment before graduating, and will accept immedi- 
ately after commencement. 
THE BOARD OF TRUST—IMPORTANT CHANGES IN ITS CONSTITUTION 
AND ORGANIZATION. 
The character, organization, and composition of the board of trust 
have undergone important changes. The principal changes are: (1) 
An increase in the number of sustaining conferences; (2) the transfer- 
ence of the election of members from the conferences to the board; (3) 
a diminution in the number of representatives accorded to each con- 
ference; (4) the substitution of limited terms of service for life terms 
and the expiration of these terms, so as to secure a board composed at 
once of old and of new elements; and (5) the exercise by the bishops 
of the church of their chartered rights, which are virtually the rights 
of trustees. 
(1) Four of the conferences—the North Alabama, Alabama, Missis- 
sippi, and Louisiana—which had united in applying for a charter for 
Central University failed after the charter had been obtained to take 
any steps in favor and support of the university; and in January, 1873, 
the board of trust declared vacant the seats of the representatives of 
these conferences. It afterwards appearing that the North Alabama 
Conference had postponed action for the sake of harmony and that it 
now desired to codperate in establishing and supporting the university, 
the board rescinded its resolution of January, 1873, so far as the North 
Alabama Conference was concerned and elected the nominees of the 
conference to seats in its body, May, 1875. These nominees were C.D. 
Oliver, D. D., Rev. Anson West, Hon. W. B. Wood, and J. J. Dement, 
M.D. Nine years later, in 1884, the Louisville Conference was admitted 
as one of the coéperating conferences and Rey. R. W. Browder and 
Wilbur F. Barclay, alumni of the university, were elected its repre- 
sentatives—this in response to a petition from the alumni association 
asking for representation in the board. The admission of the Louis- 
ville Conference had been proposed some years before, but the petition 
of the alumni association brought the matter to a head. 
(2) By-law No.7 of the board of trust, adopted in 1873, provided that 
if a vacancy should occur in the representation of a conference it should 
be filled by the board upon the nomination of the conference. In his 
message to the board September 30, 1874, President McTyeire gave 
some clear and cogent reasons why the board should fill its own vacan- 
cies. He said: 
Tho constitution, fitness, and safety of the board having this vast and growing
-P-A-G-E-181

interest in trust will be very uncertain if by popular election on hasty and perhaps 
ill-considered grounds of choice its future members are to be supplied; whereas the 
board knows its own wants, is familiar with the nature of the work to be done, has 
the university and its interests in mind and in heart, and is ever watchful of its wel- 
fare and on the lookout for suitable instruments and agents to promote it. 
These reasons prevailed with the board and at its next meeting, May, 
1875, it enacted that vacancies should be filled on its own nomination, 
subject to the confirmation of the conferences concerned. Despite op- 
position in some quarters this method of continuing the existence of 
the board has ultimately prevailed and in the future will probably be 
accepted with little question. The charter guarantees a “ fair repre- 
sentation in the management of the university to any annual confer- 
ence hereafter codperating with us.” It is doubtful whether this pro- 
vision applies at all to the originally codperating conferences, and if it 
does it is within the competence of the board to grant this “ fair repre- 
sentation” in its own way. 
(8) In 1882 the representation of each conference in the board of 
trustees was reduced to two members, one clerical and one lay. The 
reduction was not made at once, but it was enacted that no vacancies 
should be filled until it became necessary to do so in order to maintain 
the representation of the conference at the minimum of two. 
(4) A most important change in the character and constitution of the 
board was made in 1888, a change intended by the constant infusion of 
new elements to secure a live, progressive board, a board in touch and 
sympathy with the times, and yet whose conservatism and capacity for 
affairs should be maintained by the presence of a majority of old, ex- 
perienced members. The change was this: The four members from the 
Tennessee and North Alabama conferences to go out in 1890; the four 
from the Memphis and North Mississippi conferences in 1892; the four 
from the Louisville and Little Rock conferences in 1894; the four from 
the Arkansas and White River conferences in 1896; in 1890 and every 
two years thereafter as the terms of one-fourth of the members of the 
board should expire their places to be filled by election; the members 
to be removable for cause and to stay in office until their successors 
should be elected and confirmed. 
(5) Occasionally a bishop appeared in the meetings of the board of 
trust and was welcomed to a share in its deliberations, but not until 
President McTyeire’s death did the bishops as a whole exercise the 
rights conferred on them by the charter of the university, the rights 
virtually of regular trustees of the institution. It was Bishop Me- 
Tyeire’s request that they should exercise these rights and assume a 
responsibility in the management of the university, and since his death 
they have done so. 
The codperating conferences have no control over the university 
unless the presence in the board of trust of representatives irrespon- 
sible to them is control. However, reports are made by the university
-P-A-G-E-182
  140 HIGHER EDUCATION IN. TENNESSEE. 
to the conferences and its representatives appear before them to urge 
its claims. 
The executive committee of the board of trust, clothed between meet- 
ings of the board with full powers, their exercise, however, subject to 
the review of the board, has played a prominent réle inthe governance 
and administration of the university, and has often decided matters 
most important to its welfare. As at first constituted it was composed. 
of the president, the secretary, and the treasurer of the board, and of 
one member of the board from each conference, elected annually. Since 
1875 it has been made up of the president and the secretary and threé 
members of the board, elected annually, a smaller body and therefore 
more prompt to decide and more swift to act. 
Dr. R. A. Young was secretary and financial agent of the board of 
trust from 1873 to 1882. Since then he has been simply secretary. 
Dr. A. L. P. Green was treasurer till his death in 1874. The treasurers 
since him have been Dempsey Weaver, 1874~79; Thomas D. Fite, 
1880-85, and E. W. Cole, 1886. When the executive committee was 
reduced in size, D. C. Kelley, E..H. East, and D. T. Reynolds were 
elected the unofficial members. No changes were made in the compo- 
sition of the committee until 1889 and 1890. In the former year Presi- 
dent McTyeire died and was succeeded by President Hargrove. In the 
latter year the elective membership of the committee was renewed by 
the choice of Robert W. Browder, D. D., Judge EH. H. East, and Anson 
West, D. D. The board of trust at the present time is constituted as 
follows: Rev. S. H. Babcock, Robert W. Browder, D. D., J. W. Brown, 
M. D., A. R. Carter, B. A., Rev. G. A. Donnelly, J. J. Dement, M. D., EH. 
H. East, H. W. Foote, T. T. Hillman, Andrew Hunter, D. D., W. C. John- 
son, D. D., L. Q. C. Lamar, R. J. Morgan, Rev. T. Y. Ramsey, J. W. 
Stayton, S. K. Stone, Anson West, D. D., R. A. Young, D.D., and Bish- 
ops J. C. Keener, A. W. Wilson, J. C. Granbery, R. K. Hargrove, W. 
W. Duncan, C. B. Galloway, E. R. Hendrix, J. 8. Key, A. G. Haygood, 
and O, P. Fitzgerald. 
DEATH OF PRESIDENT WTYEIRE AND ELECTION OF HIS SUCCESSOR, 
’ On the 15th day of February, 1889, Holland N. MeTyeire, president 
of the board of trustees of Vanderbilt university, died. His body 
lies buried on the university campus. Without Bishop McTyeire, Cen- 
tral University might have been, but without him Vanderbilt Univer- 
sity would never have been. And had he not lived to lay the first 
stones in the structure, Vanderbilt University would not have been 
whatitis. Few institutions in their beginnings are so much the work 
of one man. Of his wife, Bishop McTyeire said: “My wife wasa 
silent but golden link in the chain of Providence that led to Vander- 
bilt University,” and he asked that she be given an allowance of $1,000 
a year and be permitted to end her days in the old home on the cam-
-P-A-G-E-183
VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY. 141 
pus.! Both requests were granted. Mrs. MeTyeire did not long sur- 
vive her husband. She died January 14, 1891. 
During Bishop McTyeire’s illness and until the election of his suc- 
cessor, Judge E. H. Hast, one of the seven vice-presidents of the board of 
trustees and a member of theexecutive committee, performed the duties 
of the president’s office. The board met in May, 1889, and elected 
Bishop R. K. Hargrove president. Bishop McTyeire’s powers had been. 
anomalous, and the question whether or not Commodore Vanderbilt 
had intended that they should descend to his successor was a delicate 
and difficult one. The right of veto was not withdrawn from the sec- 
ond president, but it was understood that the exceptional powers of 
the first president should not be exercised by him. He is unsalaried, 
but receives $1,000 a year as commutation for house rent. 
The first president of Vanderbilt University was a high church dig- 
nitary, and so is the second president. After the death of Bishop 
McTyeire much was said and written on the subject of his successor. 
Should he be a clergyman or a layman, and should the choice be re- 
stricted to the Methodist Episcopal Church South? Many held that 
the university was a gift to the whole South and demanded that the 
trust be administered in the interest of no sect or section. But the 
trustees, conceiving that the gift was to the church first of all and 
through her to the South, thought it but right that a man high in her 
councils should be the head of Vanderbilt University. 
SKETCH OF BISHOP WTYEIRE. 
The following sketch of Bishop MeTyeire was written by Dr. W. M. 
Baskervill, professor of English language and literature in the Van- 
derbilt. Being a son-in-law of the bishop’s, Dr. Baskervill had the 
advantage of a nearer view of his mind and character: 
Since Thomas Jefferson no man has left such an impress upon education in the 
South as Bishop H. N. MeTyeire. He had passed little time in the schoolroom, only 
serving as tutor for a short while at Randolph-Macon College in Virginia. But he 
had peculiar qualifications for the great work to which he was called. Born in South 
Carolina, educated in Virginia, he had before he became a bishop served his church 
as pastor and editor in Virginia, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee. 
After his election to that office he had traveled all over the South and West; he had 
an inquiring mind, rare powers of observation, and a tenacious memory; and it can 
1The sentence quoted from Bishop MeTyeire, ‘‘My wife was a silent but golden 
link in the chain of Providence that led to Vanderbilt University,” and his request, 
that she be given an allowance of $1,000 a year and be permitted to end her days in} 
the old home on the campus, were opt eined a in a paper prepared by him on the, 
eve of his departure for the Methodist Ecumenical Conference held in London in 
1881 and read before the board of trust after his death. In his will he did not 
ask an annuity for his wife, but asked only that she might spend her widowhood in 
the old home, ‘‘not sharing it with any professor or officer.” The sentence quoted 
above is slightly changed in his will. It reads: ‘‘My wife was a silent but golden 
link in the chain that brought and bound this university to Nashville and especially 
to Methodism.

safely be said that no other man in the South knew the wants and needs of the peo- 
ple better than he. 
Especially was this true in regard to education. He belonged to a denomination 
which, he loved to remember, sprung from a university, yet which sank its roots deep 
into the popular heart. Equally at home ina palace or a cabin, before an ecumen- 
ical body or a congregation of mountaineers, he was a typical man of his church. 
His mind had long dwelt on educational problems. The old-time academies had 
almost ceased to exist, and the colleges, oftentimes burdened with debt and always 
struggling to live, appealed to him in every Southern State. He must needs think 
about education. So, along with others, he planned and worked for something bet- 
ter. By aseries of masterly papers he showed the need and the uses of a great cen- 
tral university—an institution thoroughly equipped and well endowed. When he 
met Commodore Vanderbilt his plans were well matured. Each had what the other 
wanted. The typical southérner and the typical northerner—each strong in his own 
convictions, but both having at heart the best iuterests of the whole country—formed. 
a partnership in which heart and brain strove to show to the world what money, con- 
trolled by great executive ability and used with a perfect knowledge of the situation, 
could do toward the upbuilding of the South and the restoration of fraternal feel- 
ings. 
As soon as the first gift was made, Bishop McTyeire set to work with his usual 
thoroughness and deliberation. He visited the best institutions of the country, 
talked with presidents and professors, looked at the grounds, inspected the build- 
ings, and studied all the details of these great foundations. He sent specialists to 
Europe to buy scientific apparatus. He picked able professors from different col- 
lJeges and intrusted to them the organization of the departments and the formation 
of courses of study. All material interests he attended to himself. 
In the matter of location and choice of site Bishop McTyeire’s idea was to blend 
the ideal and the practical. ‘Academie shades and philosophic tranquillity” had 
great charms for him, but he also knew that “character is formed in the stream of 
life.” No monastic traditions fettered his mind. With a quiet smile he used to tell 
of an agent who recommended an out-of-the-way place as more suitable than the 
site afterwards chosen, by saying: “ Bishop, the boys will be looking out of the win- 
dows there.” His reply was characteristic: ‘We want them to look out, and to 
know what is going on outside.” This leader of men well knew that observation 
and contact with men had given him by far the better part of his education. No 
place for a real university like a thriving, growing, bustling city, was his opinion. 
One condition of the gift was that Bishop McTyeire should have his home on the 
campus. The permanent endowment was given in such a shape that it could easily 
take care of itself. But during his life the president of the board of trustees expended 
over $600,000 in grounds, buildings, apparatus, etc., and it is safe to say that not a 
walk was made nor a drive laid off, not a tree or shrub was planted, not a building 
was designed, and seareely a brick or a stone put in place which did not receive his 
careful inspection and get his personal approval. This minute personal oversight 
and direction he maintained till he was taken away. 
In the purely educational affairs of the universty his influence was great, but 
used indirectly. The curricula and the instruction of classes were left to the faculty. 
No change of policy could be effected except through him, but the suggestions and 
the plans generally originated in that body. He wanted numbers, but he valued 
scholarship more. Hence he lent the weight of his powerful influence to the aboli- 
tion of subcollegiate classes, to the reorganization of the Biblical department, and 
all the other changes that were made during his lifetime. Hehad the happy faculty 
of waiting and the willingness to be responsible for unpopular measures, if thereby 
he saw any gain to the university. But he was specially desirous of having a har- 
monious faculty, and when any new measure was proposed to the board of trustees 
through him, his first question was, “Are tho faculty agreed?” Towards the end

of his life he came to that body more and more for counsel and advice. The last 
time he met with them hesaid, ‘ Gentlemen, the session of the board is near at hand 
and I have come to consult with you. I can get more in an hour's talk with you 
than in a week from them.” 
His personal relations to officers and students were kind and courteous.. He took 
a friendly interest in them and in their work. If a professor wrote a timely article 
or published a work, or if a student distinguished himself in any way, he was sure 
to find in “‘the bishop,” as all loved to call him, appreciation and encouragement. 
He had a way of greeting the new student, especially if he was fresh froma country 
home, so as ina very few moments to make him feel that he had found an old friend. 
In many cases this was true, for owing to the bishop’s wide acquaintance ho was al- 
most sure to know the new boy’s father and mother, er at least his pastor or some 
well-known public maninhisneighborhood. Hehad a habit of studying the matrieu- 
lation book to find out who the students were and where they came from, and a hint 
ora suggestion would oftentimes place the student with all his home ties in the bish- 
op’ssingulariy tenacious memory. In this way he quietly established himself in the 
confidence of the students, and there were few who did not feel safer for having him 
as counselor and friend. Many young men were educated at his expense, but this 
was done so quietly and unestentatiously that often not even a member of his own 
family would ever hear of it. 
A familiar sight to old students was the bishop, as he strolled about the campus. 
The large frame, with its broad shoulders and massive head surmounted by a wide- 
brimmed hat, the long white cane in the right hand, and the leisurely gait will not 
soon be forgotten. It gave him special pleasure to have some one accompany 
him during these strolls, and at such times he was most communicative dnd reininis- 
cential. Now he could be seen plucking a magnolia—his favorite flower—for a 
friend in her carriage or stopping to give a welcome to some old acquaintance or to 
extend a courtesy to strangers. To these he was alwaysattentive. Mr. J.M. Leech, 
that courteous Virginian and former secretary of the faculty, has recorded this inei- 
dent: ‘He once cordially thanked me for conducting through the university build- 
ings a company of plain country people, among whom was a woman with a baby in 
her arms. ‘Who knows what may come of that visit?’ said he. ‘It may bring that 
baby here as a student. He may yet be one of our illustrious men. Who knows? 
Who knows? Such people are not to be neglected. Great men come of them.’” 
By many he wasthought to be austere and unsympathetic. A man of positive con- 
victions and tenacity of purpose necessarily makes enemies, and the first president 
of Vanderbilt University was no exception to the rule. But, though he was firm and 
unyielding where principle was concerned, he never persecuted or oppressed any 
man. There was no vindictiveness in his nature. He changed the whole policy of 
his management more than once, for he ever learned from experience, and each time 
some good men threw themselves across his path and suffered the consequences. 
The interests of the university were dearer to him than the favorof any man. He 
sundered the ties of some esteemed friendships in this work and had to meet much 
active and unfriendly opposition in the prosecution of his carefully considered 
plans for the welfare of the university. But not one that opposed suffered as much 
as he, though he never showed it. On his death bed he looked back on his admin- 
istration without regret, for though he acknowledged that he had made some mis- 
takes he felt that in every instance he had done the best he knew how to do with the 
light hefore him. The universal sorrow among professors and students at his un- 
timely taking off, which each year intensifies, is the best tribute to his great and 
noble leadership and wise administration. 
ENDOWMENT, REVENUE, AND PLANT. 
More than one Vanderbilt has given of his wealth to the university; 
the son and the grandsons of the founder are benefactors of the institu-

tion. William H. Vanderbilt gave all told over $450,000. His first 
donation was one of $100,000 for the construction of the gymnasium, 
seience hall, and Wesley hall. Instead of costing only $100,000 these 
buildings cost $145,404.77. Mr. Vanderbilt promptly supplied the 
deficit. The addition of $100,000 in 1883 to the endowment fund was 
made with special reference to the needs of the engineering department. 
Later Mr. Vanderbilt gave $10,000 to President MeTyeire as a token 
of his appreciation of the management of the university, to be used as 
he pleased. 
Mr. Vanderbilt died December 8, 1885, and left $200,000 to the uni- 
versity. This was added to the endowment, swelling it to $900,000. 
The bequest tax of $11,775- imposed upon the legacy by the State of 
New York was paid by Cornelius and William K. Vanderbilt. Besides 
this Cornelius Vanderbilt has given $30,000 to the university, $10,000 
for the library, and $20,000 for the hall of mechanical engineering. 
Vanderbilt University has received in round numbers, exclusive of 
the Biblical-department funds, $1,500,000. Nine hundred thousand 
dollars have been reserved as productive endowment and $600,000 have 
been expended in grounds, buildings, furnishings, machinery, and appa- 
ratus. Much of the annual revenue has, of course, been used in main- 
taining and improving the plant and enhancing its value by additions 
to buildings and equipment. The broad campus of 74 acres, with its 
walks and its drives, its grass and its trees, is the delight of the stu- 
dent and the admiration of the stranger. A happy mean has been 
struck between the artificial and the natural. It is on high ground 
just west of the Nashville corporation line. Toward the west it is level; 
toward the north and east, in the direction of the city, it slopes gently. 
Along the top of the slope and facing the city are situated three of the 
principal buildings—university hall, science hall, and Wesley hall. 
West of these are the gymnasium, the observatory, professors’ houses, 
and students’ dormitories. East of them, at the foot of the slope, is 
Mechanical Engineering Hall. Along the north side of the campus runs 
a double-track electric railway, rendering easy of access any part of 
‘Nashville. 
University Hall, the center of university life, is the northernmost of 
the larger buildings. 
This building, devoted to general university purposes, is also occupied by the aca- 
demic department and by the department of pharmacy. 
The structure is of brick, with gray-stone trimmings, four stories in height, and 
190 feet front by 140 feet deep. The first floor is occupied wholly by the schools of 
chemistry and pharmacy, with their lecture-rooms, working and special laborato- 
ties, balance-room, museums, and chemical storing vaults. The next floor has the 
business offices of the university, the apparatus, experimental rooms, and labera- 
tory of the school of physics, and other lecture rooms. The remaining floors are 
occupied by the university chapel (of Gothic interior architecture), the library and 
reading room, literary society halls, lecture rooms, and professors’ studies. The 
building throughout is warmed by steam from the heating station in the Hall of 
Mechanical Engineering, lighted by gas, well ventilated, and protected from fire by 
water pipes on every floor.

Brief descriptions have already been given of Science Hall, Wesley 
Hall, and the Hall of Mechanical Engineering. The other buildings 
on the campus are the observatory, the gymnasium, the west-side dor- 
mitories, the residences of professors and other employés of the uni- 
versity, etc. Outside the campus there is one professor’s residence and 
. inside there are nine such. All the latter are of brick, three of them 
cottages and the rest large two-story houses. On the northwest cor- 
ner of the campus there are seven brick dormitories for the use of stu- 
dents, the first of which was built in, 1886. Six of them are after the 
same model and contain eight rooms apiece. The seventh is con- 
structed differently and contains, in addition to a number of living 
rooms, dining room, kitchen, and office. From the occupant or occu- 
pants of each room the university receives an annual rent of $25. The 
messing system obtains at West Side, as in Wesley Hall. Students of 
any department on the campus and students of the law department 
who have been students of the academic department and have lived 
at West Side are permitted to board there. This limitation imposed 
upon the residence of law students is necessitated by want of room. The 
gymnasium was built at the same time as Wesley Hall and Science 
Hall. Itisa brick building 90 by 60 feet, well furnished with gymnastic 
apparatus. At either end is a visitors’ gallery and below is a base- 
ment containing dressing and bath rooms. The observatory, a small 
brick building constructed solely for astronomical purposes, is centrally 
located on high ground. It is provided with an equatorial of 6-inch 
aperture and 8-foot focal length, accompanied by a stellar and solar 
spectroscope; a meridian circle reading to seconds, with four microme- 
ters; an astronomical clock, and an altazimuth. The law and den- 
tal building, recently erected, is on Cherry street, in the heart of 
the city. It is five stories high, with sandstone front, and is one of the 
handsomest structures in Nashville. Only a portion of it is used by 
the law and dental departments, the rest being occupied by rented offi- 
ces. Lot and building cost nearly $100,000 and represent an invest- 
ment of that much of the endowment fund. 
The library occupies two rooms in University Hall. It has a large 
branch in Wesley Hall and a few of its books and publications may be 
found in Science Hall and the Hall of Mechanical Engineering. A good 
number of current newspapers and magazines is kept on hand. But 
the shelves betray a deplorable want. They contain only about 15,000 
volumes. Well and in some regards splendidly equipped in respect of 
scientific apparatus, the university lags far behind her general progress 
in the matter of a library. ; 
The endowment of Vanderbilt University was all given in $5,000 
second-mortgage bonds of the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern 
Railway, bearing 7 per cent interest and maturing in 1903. Although 
these bonds are first-class securities, they of course tend to fall to par 
as the date of their liquidation approaches. The withdrawal of the |

endowment and its reinvestment have accordingly been begun, By 
May, 1891, $165,000 worth of bonds par value had been sold and the 
proceeds invested in the Law and Dental Building and in certain bonds 
secured by improved Nashville real estate. With the fallin the rate 
* of interest 7 per cent has become an exceptionally good return on capi- 
tal. That it will not be realized again by the university is certain. 
Even at this early stage in the process of reinvestment the revenues 
from the endowment fund have been seriously impaired. 
The annual budget of the university is about $70,000, sometimes 
less, generally more. Several thousand dollars of the receipts are tui- 
tion, matriculation, library, and laboratory fees. The fees in the 
academic and engineering departments are $65: Tuition, $50; matricu- 
lation, $10; and library, $5; these in addition to laboratory fees when 
laboratory work is done. Many students, the holders of scholarships, 
pay no tuition fees, of which more anon. The fees in the department of 
pharmacy are: Tuition, $25; laboratory, $25; matriculation, $10; and 
library, $5. Biblical students pay no tuition fees, their only fees being 
matriculation and library fees. The law, dental, and medical depart- 
ments are not included in this budget. If they were included their 
fees would swell the annual revenues of the university to consid-, 
erably over $100,000. Of late expense has exceeded income, and the 
university in consequence is in straitened circumstances. The very 
name of Vanderbilt suggests to most people possession of unlimited 
resources. It never once occurs to them that the revenues of the uni- 
versity may be inadequate to its purposes; but this is true, neverthe- 
less, and the need of more money is urgent. The institution is built on 
a large plan and large means are required to run it. 
ABOLITION OF SUBCOLLEGIATE CLASSES AND ELEVATION OF STAND- 
ARD OF ADMISSION. 
Subcollegiate classes clung to the university for many years, the 
authorities not feeling strong enough to shake them off. The number 
of well-trained men who sought admission grew very slowly. Ill-trained. 
men, it seemed, had to be taken or none. But the faculty chafed 
under the apparent necessity. Said Chancellor Garland: “With its ex- 
istence [that of the subcollege class] Iam sure the university can 
never exercise that elevating influence upon the preparatory schools of 
the country which it might do and which is one of its most important 
functions.” At last, in 1887, on petition of the faculty, the board of 
trustees enacted the abolition of subcollege classes. But another year 
passed before the last one disappeared. The standard of entrance to 
the university is being all the while raised. Many applicants for ad- 
mission are turned away and bidden go to a fitting schocl. In conse- 
quence the character of the fitting schools as well as of the university 
is being elevated. The fitting schools appreciate the spirit which the 
Vanderbilt shows in setting a high standard and in relegating the work
-P-A-G-E-191
  
VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY. < 147 
of preparation where it belongs, to themselves, and are giving the insti- 
tution their hearty codperation and support. 
Although no official relations exist, a few fitting schools are ree- 
ognized as special feeders to the Vanderbilt, some of them in fact being 
manned by Vanderbilt graduates, while the students from several are 
admitted without examination upon the certificate of their principals. 
The following extract from a paper read before a recent meeting of the 
State Teachers’ Association. by the head of one of the preparatory 
schools is evidence from a competent judge of the high standard of 
admission to the university: 
Three years ago we had two boys who were classmates. One graduated from a 
certain university with the degree of C. E. before the other had entered the fresh- 
man class in Vanderbilt. Yet the latter had lost no time from school and was decid- 
edly the superior both in ability and application. 
The abolition of subcollege classes and the tightening of the entrance 
requirements had the effect of diminishing the enrollment, but that is 
recovering and will ere long surpass its former limit. 
Two years ago the plan was inaugurated of holding entrance exam- 
inations in.June as well as in September, and not only at the university, 
but in various towns and cities of the South and West. Though this 
plan met with little success at first, a large proportion of the freshman 
class is now received into the ariiversity i in this way. 
We subjoin the requirements for admission to the courses in arti as 
printed in the current announcement. For admission to either course 
in science, the examinations in mathematics, English, geography, and 
United States history are the same as for admission to the courses in 
arts. Both courses in science require an examination in German but 
none in French. One of them requires an examination in Latin, which 
is the same as the arts examination. Applicants wishing to enter as 
irregular students must pass the same examinations in English, geog- 
raphy, and United States history as the regulars, and an examination 
in mathematics, which, however, is less rigid than that set for regulars. 
If an irregular falls below the minimum of 40 on more than one exami- 
nation he can not be conditioned, but is denied admission to the uni- 
versity. 
FOR ADMISSION TO THE COURSES IN ARTS. 
(1) Latin.—Cesar’s Gallic War, four books; Virgil’s Aineid, four books; the four 
orations of Cicero against Catiline. Any one of the following grammars is recom- 
mended: Allen and Greencugh’s, Gildersleeve’s, or Harkness’s. It is earnestly 
recommended that work in Latin composition be carried on hand in hand with the 
reading at every stage of the preparatory course. For this purpose either of the 
following works may be used: Exercises in Latin Composition, by M. G. Daniell, or 
Practical Latin Composition, by W. C. Collar. An exercise similar to those given 
in these works will be given, and a passage of average difficulty from Cesar or 
Cicero will be set for translation at sight. The Roman pronunciation is recom- 
mended. 
(2) Greek.—Etymology, elementary syntax, four books of Xenophon’s Anabasis, 
two books of Homer’s Iliad, elementary prose composition (Jones’s Greek Exercises
-P-A-G-E-192
  148 HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE. 
will cover the amount required). Goodwin's or Hadley-Allen’s grammar is recom- 
mended. A passage from some one of Xenophon’s works will be assigned for trans- 
lation at sight. 
(3) Mathematics.—Arithmetic, including the metric system of weights and meas- 
ures; algebra in simple and quadratic equations, calculus of radicals, binomial the- 
orem, indeterminate coefiicients, and theory of logarithms; plane and solid geom- 
etry. 
(4) English.—Meiklejohn’s English Language (or its equivalent in English gram- 
mar and analysis of the sentence). A composition of not less than one foolscap 
page in length must be written in the examination room, and the subject for this 
exercise will be given at the time by the examiner. The subject will be taken from 
one of the following books: Merchant of Venice, Julius Cesar, Robinson Crusoe, 
Evangeline, Vicar of Wakefield, Franklin’s Autobiography. 
(5) Geography and United States History.—Outlines, Tables, and Sketches in United 
States History, written and published by Miss 8. L. Ensign, of Cedar Falls, Iowa, 
should be used in connection with a good history of the United States, such as 
Johnston’s. In geography, Harper’s or some other good manual is recommended. 
Teachers of the subject would be helped by Child and Nature, by A. E. Frye, of 
Hyde Park, Mass. It is not sufficient to have once studied geography and United 
States history, A fresh review before the examination is almost imperative. Until 
this department can be brought up to the standard of the other studies in the pre- 
paratory schools, all students, even though admitted on certificate in other branches, 
will be examined in United States history and general geography. 
Applicants failing to attain the required standard in more than two of the above 
five subjects will not be admitted. Those falling below 60 per cent, but attaining 
not less than 40, on not more than two subjects, will be conditioned. Such students 
must make up their deficiency by private study, and before the close of the scholas- 
tic year be subjected to a second examination on the subjects on which they failed. 
Two prizes of $50 each are given for the best entrance examinations, 
the one in English, mathematics, history, and geography, the other in 
Latin and Greek. 
RECONSTRUCTION OF SCHEME OF STUDIES AND DEGREES AND DIS- 
TINCT SEPARATION OF COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY INSTRUCTION. 
The scheme of studies and degrees outlined earlier in this history 
remained practically unchanged until the year 1887. Then the ax was 
laid at the root of the tree and the scheme was abolished. The two 
most important innovations were the introduction of the class system, 
with its freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior, and its order of pre- 
scribed studies for each year, but with a large number of electives in 
the third and fourth years, and the running of a distinct line of demar- 
cation between college and university instruction. The former change 
brought the Vanderbilt into conformity with the large, progressive 
institutions of the North, and the latter change, together with other 
causes, gave such an impetus to the prosecution of advanced studies 
that the Commissioner of Education ranked the Vanderbilt among the 
six leading universities of the country doing post-graduate work. 
The college degree of B. P. was dropped, and replaced soon after by 
that of B.L. (bachelor of letters). M. A. was made a university 
degree, Ph. D. being already so considered: and M. 8. (master of sci- 
 
-P-A-G-E-193
  
VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY. _ 149 
ence) and D. Se. (doctor of science), corresponding to M. A. and Ph. D., 
were created. Ten new fellowships, open to baccalaureate graduates of 
the Vanderbilt and other institutions of recognized standing, were 
founded, and special stress was laid upon post-graduate work. <A 
standing committee, the committee on university instruction, composed 
of the chancellor and four other academic professors, was created, with 
general control and direction over all university instruction. The 
membership of this committee is the same now as it was at the first, 
namely: Chancellor Garland, ex officio chairman; Prof. Baskervill, secre: 
tary; and Profs. Vaughn, Smith,and Dudley. Quiterecently the degree 
of B. L. was abolished and two courses leading to B. A. and two lead- 
ing to B.S. were offered, whereas only one course in each had been 
offered before. 
COLLEGE DEGREES. 
Below we give the course in arts No. 1 and the course in science No. 
1. The arts course No. 2 requires only one year each in mathemat- 
ies, history, and moral philosophy. It includes among the required 
studies, however, a year of French and a year of German. Science 
course No, 2 requires two years of Latin, whereas course No.1 requires 
none at all; but it requires only one year of French and one year of 
natural history and geology. It requires no history, but there are two 
years of history among the electives. :

The prescription of these degree courses does not debar irregular 
students, who may select special studies with the sanction of the fac- 
ulty. No student may take less than the given minimum nor more 
than the given maximum number of hours per week. “Every student, 
except by special permission of the faculty, must not have less than 
fourteen (14) nor more than twenty (20) recitations and lectures per 
week or their equivalent.” 
The Vanderbilt curriculum is a “ stiff” one and her degrees are hard 
to get. One proof of this is thesmall number who graduate out of those 
who matriculate. In marked contrast with the high value attached to 
a degree here stand the lax requirements of so many Southern colleges 
and the low estimate they put upon their degrees, as evidenced by these 
requirements. The-whole tendency of the Vanderbilt is to elevate and 
dignify college education; the college diploma is not a cheap thing to 
be obtained in any way by any kind of student.

UNIVERSITY DEGREES. 
Master of Arts (M. A.) may now be obtained by fulfilling tke follow- 
ing conditions: 
The candidate for this degree must have received the degree of B, A. from this 
university, or from some other institution of good standing, subject to the approval 
of the university instruction committee. In addition, the candidate must spend at 
least one year at this university in the pursuit of post-graduate studies, which must 
embrace four full courses of instruction, of three hours per week each, in at least 
three schools. In these four courses he Must obtain a grade of at least 80 per cent. 
The present requirements for doctor of philosophy (Ph. D.) are thus 
stated: 
To obtain this degreo the candidate is required to pursue three distinct studies to 
be selected by himself—one principal and two subsidiary—for not less than three 
years after taking his B. A. degree, two of which must be spent in attendance at 
the university. He must possess sufficient knowledge of French and German to use 
with facility works in those languages relating to his special studies, and must sub- 
mit to the committee on university instruction, at least three months before he is 
admitted to examination, a written dissertation which shall give evidence ‘of inde- 
pendent investigation. This thesis must be printed at the expense of the candidate 
and fifty copies placed in the university library. 
Master of science (M. 8.) and doctor of science (D. Se.), correspond- 
ing to M. A. and Ph. D., are the post-graduate degrees conferred on 
holders of B.S.; M. A. and Ph. D. being obtainable only by B. A. 
graduates. When the candidate for doctor’s honors presents his 
thesis, the committee on university instruction refers it to two referees 
for acceptance or rejection. If it is accepted the candidate appears 
before the chancellor and the whole body of the academic faculty and 
is subjected to an oral examination by three special examiners, one 
for each subject pursued. The recommendation of the examiners for 
the admission of the candidate to the doctorate must be unanimous. 
Courses leading to university degrees are offered by all the eleven 
schools of the academic department. A transcription from an official 
announcement of the courses offered in Greek and chemistry will serve 
to indicate the character of the work done and the methods employed 
in all the schools. The seminary, it will be noted, is one of the agents 
used. 
SCHOOL OF GREEK. 
[Prof. Smith. Reno Downer, assistant. ] 
The object of the university course in Greek is to give advanced, especially grad- 
uate, students an opportunity to pursue a wider range of reading in Greek literature, 
to become more fully acquainted with the results of philological investigation, and 
to learn methods of original research. 
During the past year a regular course of lectures was given on Greek and Roman 
mythology. Inthe seminary the work was: (1) The study of Greek dialects through 
inscriptions (Cauer); (2) the interpretation and discussion of the parts of Pausanias 
that related especially to the city of Athens.  
-P-A-G-E-201
  VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY. 157 
1891-’92. 
A course of lectures will be given on Greek literature, especially the earlier periods. 
In the seminary Wolf’s Prolegomena will be interpreted as a basis for the study of 
the Homeric question, and certain parts of the [iad will be selected for textual 
criticism. Each member of the class will in his turn take the lead in the seminary 
interpretations and discussions, the subject or part of each being assigned from two 
to several weeks beforehand, on which he will offer either a paper or a discussion 
from carefully prepared notes. The Iliad and Odyssey will be read privately by the 
class, and examiations will be held on all the work, lectures, seminary discussions, 
and private reading. 
SCHOOL OF CHEMISTRY. 
[Prof. Dudley. J.T. McGill, adjunct professor.] 
Candidates for the degree of master of arts who elect chemistry must have had 
training at least equivalent to that required for continuation in the junior (B. S. 
No.1) class in both lecture room and laboratory. Their work may begin with the 
Junior B. 8. No.1, including laboratory exercises three times a week. 
Candidates for the degree of master of science who elect chemistry must have had 
training equivalent to that required and offered as elective in the bachelor of science 
course of study (No.1) through the junior year, including laboratory work. They 
will take the senior with laboratory exercises, and an equivalent to one hour in addi- 
tion, or pursue such other text-book and laboratory work as may be assigned. 
‘The university work in chemistry leading to a doctorate is based almost wholly 
upon original investigation carried on by the student in the laboratory, under the 
guidance or with the advice of the instructor. Instruction is also given by informal 
lectures, interspersed with discussion between the instructor and the students. The 
line of investigation pursued may be selected by the student, but must be approved 
by the professors; and in each case the student must carefully prepare an historical 
synopsis of the work which has been done by other investigators along the line 
which he has selected, by reference to the original papers and memoirs. This synop- 
sis shall be presented and read by him before the instructors, fellows, and advanced 
students, by whom it will be discussed and criticized. The subject selected will 
require at least one year’s work on the part of the student; and when completed 
he shall prepare a thesis covering his investigations. 
HONORARY DEGREES. 
The custom of granting M. A. upon other considerations than those 
of study in residence has never existed at the Vanderbilt. Neither does 
the pernicious practice of conferring honorary degrees obtain. Only 
one honorary degree has been conferred in the history of the institu- 
tion, and that was the degree of LL. D. conferred in 1883 upon Milton 
W. Humphreys, the retiring professor of Greek, now a professor in the 
University of Virginia, for “eminent attainments in classical learning 
and valuable contributions to philological science.” If the Vanderbilt 
is always as chary of her honorary degrees, they will always mean some- 
thing. 
NUMBER OF ACADEMIC DEGREES CONFERRED. 
The university has conferred 150 academic degrees. The following 
table shows how many of each degree have been conferred during the

  THE VANDERBILT AS A UNIVERSITY. 
In her various departments, professional and nonprofessional, the 
Vanderbilt is a university in the extensive sense of the word; and she 
is earnestly and strenuously striving to merit the title in the intensive 
sense, also, by devoting her means and her energy as far as possible to 
post-college nonprofessional work. She is fully aware that in the pres- 
ent day the reputation of an institution of learning depends in an ever- 
increasing degree on the amount and character of this higher work. 
An extract or two from recent reports of the chancellor to the board of 
trust, who represents and speaks for the faculty, himself one of their 
number, will show that her professors are very much alive to this fact: 
“Tt is this higher work which is the glory of the university. It is the 
 
-P-A-G-E-204
160 HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE. 
fact that we do such work that gives us character with the leading in- 
stitutions of this country and even abroad. Men who pursue higher 
courses here do us credit at Leipzig and Berlin.” “The value of our 
university work is not to be measured by the numbers upon whom it is 
expended. You can not do without it unless you become content torun 
this institution, as most American so-called universities are run, with 
nothing university-like about them except the name.” 
The Vanderbilt endeavors to employ true university methods in her 
post-graduate courses, methods whose object is “to make the student 
an investigator and thinker and to habituate him to original research.” 
The university spirit is felt even by undergraduates, and on professors 
it acts most beneficially, quickening the scholarly instinct and inciting 
to a wider and deeper learning. The teaching of post-graduate students 
who are investigating and thinking for themselves perforce keeps the 
professor abreast of the times and in close touch with advancing thought 
and speculation. He is preserved from falling a victim to the cease- 
less, monotonous round of college duties far removed from the world 
and beyond the reach of its progress, in which so many college profes- 
sors are lost inoblivion. Of the contributions of Vanderbilt professors 
to scholarship we will speak later. 
There is room for a university in the central and southernmost parts of 
the South. No institution south of the University of Virginia save the 
Vanderbilt does university work, at least any worthy of consideration. 
More and more is the Vanderbilt coming to be looked upon as a university 
by the colleges around her. Their graduates seek her fellowships and 
pursue her higher courses, and she in turn supplies them with instruct- 
ors and professors. As she obtained the support of the preparatory 
schools by abolishing her subcollegiate classes, so she is removing the 
jealousy of the colleges by showing them that she has functions which 
they can not perform, a sphere which they can not enter, lying outside of 
and beyond their own. In hislast report to the board of trust Chancel- 
lor Garland, after stating that seven Vanderbilt men had, since the pre- 
vious meeting of the board, been elected to college professorships, says: 
Such of our post-graduates as desire positions as teachers of high rank have not 
had to wait a day for employment. The demand upon us for the services of such is 
greater than we can supply. There is scarcely an institution in the Southern States” 
which does not on occasions of a vacancy in its faculty consult us in respect to 
obtaining a suitable incumbent from among our post-graduate students. The board 
must see from these statements that,’while the university course proper is prosecuted 
by a comparatively small number of pupils, it is nevertheless true that it is the part 
of our operations to which we must look chiefly for our usefulness and fame. 
It is not too much to say that the endorsement of the Vanderbilt car- 
ries as much weight in the South, at least in many parts of it, as that 
of any other institution in the country. That a Southern university 
should enjoy high credit at home is not unnatural and, just so far as 
the institution deserves the name of university, can not be other than 
cause of gratulation.

UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. 
The printed statistics of post-graduate students for the last four 
years are an accurate statement of the number of men doing university 
work. But the statistics of preceding years—1878 to 1887—are worth 
little tous. The registers from 1878 to 1887, inclusive, recorded the 
names of all graduates of the Vanderbilt and other institutions who 
were pursuing studies in any department of the university. From 
those lists have been culled those who took academic studies whether 
they took professional studies or not. Thus, some took academic stud- 
ies only, while others took as well law or theology or engineering. These 
figures far from represent the number of genuine post-graduate stu- 
dents doing post-college work; for many of these graduates pursued 
undergraduate studies either partially or wholly. Especially would 
this be true of professional students whose work in the academic depart- 
ment was not their only work. And some of the graduates from other 
institutions were applying, not for the master’s or the doctor’s degree, 
but for a bachelor’s degree. Instances have been known of so-called 
college graduates who were unable to enter higher than the sophomore 
year. The figures whose real content has thus been set forth are, 
beginning with 1877~78 and ending with 1886~’87, 10, 11, 9, 9, 7,9, 
11, 11, 10,7. Since and including 1887~’88 the register tells us how 
many men prosecuted post-graduate studies of a nonprofessional char- 
acter whether they were college graduates or not. The men in this 
list were genuine university students, although many of the graduates 
in it took along with their university studies college studies in the 
branches in which they were deficient. This is trye of the 10 scholas- 
tic fellows of 1890-91, the majority of whom entered undergraduate as 
well as post-graduate classes. For 1887-88 to 1890~91, inclusive, the 
enrollmentof advanced and graduate students doing post-graduate work 
was for the respective years 12, 17, 8, 28!. In 1887~88 all were degree- 
men; in 1888-89, 14; in 1889~90, 7, and in 1890-91, 25. 
THE FELLOWSHIP SYSTEM. 
Vanderbilt University owes to her fellowship system the majority of 
her best graduate students. Her fellowships are of two kinds—teach- 
ing and scholastic. In what follows the former is meant unless other- 
wise stated. The system was instituted early in the history of the 
university, not only to relieve professors of the labor of instruction in 
the lower classes, for that has been partly done by the creation of 
instructors and adjunct professors, but as the best means of recogniz- 
ing and rewarding the highest diligence and ability among the stu- 
dents and of enabling the university “to become the center of scholar- 
ship and culture.”   
1At the present writing, October 1891, over 40 university students have matricu- 
lated for the year now opening. 
3066 TENN: di    
-P-A-G-E-206
  162 HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE. 
Fellows are not regarded as members of the faculty—in fact, they are 
appointed upon the nomination of the faculty—but as advanced stu- 
dents, and they are under law as such. They are required to prose- 
eute higher studies in the line of their fellowship and are expected in 
time to come up for a university degree. Two hours of teaching per 
day is the maximum amount that may be exacted of a fellow; but the 
average will not exceed five or six hours a week. Fellowships are 
either graduate or post-graduate. Only college graduates are eligible 
to graduate fellowships, although the rule has sometimes been broken. 
The holders of post-graduate fellowships are either graduates in the 
post-graduate degrees or men who have held graduate fellowships for 
two years. Fellowships of the lower class yield an income of $300; 
those of the higher class an income of $500 a year. Fellows pay no 
fees, and they can usually obtain rooms in Wesley Hall free of rent. 
A $300 fellowship at the Vanderbilt is probably worth as much as a 
$500 or $600 fellowship at a Northern university, where the cost of liv- 
ing is greater and where, perhaps, the holder is not exempted from the 
payment of fees. 
The university has usually filled her teaching fellowships with the 
most promising of her own graduates. This is always done when pos- 
sible. Often has a young man had his future career determined for 
him along scholarly lines by the offer of a fellowship. All holders 
of fellowships, however, do not adopt teaching as a profession. Of 
those who have done so the most have secured positions as instructors 
or professors in other institutions, while a few have worked their way 
up into the faculty of their alma mater. Several of the fellows have 
gone to the Johns Hepkins or to German universities to do advanced 
work or to study for the doctor’s degrees. At present the schools of 
Latin, Greek, English, history and economics, mathematics, chemistry, 
and natural history and geology in the academic department, each have 
a teaching fellow, while the biblical department has one and the engi- 
neering department two. In 1887 a number of additional fellowships 
were created and opened to the graduates of the Vanderbilt and other 
institutions. But the revenues of the university not warranting their 
continuance, the additional appropriation was withdrawn the next year. 
In 1899 ten scholastic fellowships were established and the graduates 
of any reputable college able to enter upon post-graduate courses of 
study were made eligible. Free tuition and $100 a year in money are 
the emoluments of these scholastic fellowships. They are attracting 
applicants from far and wide. Last year the holders came from the 
University of the Cape of Good Hope, Emory College (Georgia), Univer- 
sity of Alabama, Williams College (Massachusetts), Cornell Univer- 
sity, Trinity College (North Carolina), University of Tennessee, Uni- 
versity of Virginia, etc.

HONORS, PRIZES, SCHOLARSHIPS, AND EXAMINATIONS. 
The honors, prizes, and scholarships of the university fall into two 
classes—those given for superior application and ability and those given 
for other reasons. The latter class will be considered first. 
Teachers of one year’s approved standing who design to make teach- 
ing a profession are exempted from the payment of tuition fees; and 
thus the university loses ten-thirteenths of the regular fees to no incon- 
siderable portion of her students. Seven students annually receive 
free tuition in return for services in the library. Four freshmen schol- 
arships recently established afford to each of their incumbents free tui- 
tion and $150 in money. The income of a scholarship may, if deemed 
desirable, be divided among two or more applicants. Of the following 
endowed scholarships the Whitthorne, Taylor, and Cartwell are old 
foundations; the two others are recent. The Whitthorne scholarships 
pay the tuition of four students and the Taylor scholarship the tuition 
of one student in the academic department, and the Cartwell fund de- 
frays all the necessary expenses of four students from Wilson County, 
Tenn. One student from Barton Academy, Mobile, Ala., is supported 
by a scholarship founded by Robert L. Crawford, of New York, and the 
R. A. Young scholarship pays the necessary expenses of a student in 
the biblical department.' 
We come to prizes and honors awarded for superior attainments in 
oratory and scholarship. ‘There are eight founder’s medals, the found- 
er’s day medal for oratory and the founder’s department medals for 
scholarship. ‘The founder’s day medal and the founder’s department 
medals for the departments then existent, four in number, were estab- 
lished by the founder himself not long before his death. The R. A. 
Young medal, endowed by Dr. R. A. Young, secretary of the board of 
trust, is a companion medal to the founder’s day medal. These are 
the only medals in oratory offered by or through the university. The 
former is spoken for during commencement week in June, the latter on 
founder’s day, May 27. The four competitors for each medal are selected 
by the faculty in a preliminary contest, law, biblical, and academic 
students being eligible. Once the literary societies elected the con- 
testants. Why they do so no longer will be seen in the treatment of 
the literary societies. The founder’s department medals are awarded 
te the best students in the graduating classes of the several depart- 
ments. They are naturally considered the highest honors conferred by 
the university; and as the academic department is the most important 
department of all, the founder’s medal in that department may be 
deemed the highest honor of all. The Owen medals (one academic, one 
biblical) were founded in 1875 by Dr. J. D. Owen, of Lebanon, Tenn. 
\Mr. Wiley P. Boddie has established a scholarship consisting of the income of 
$1,200, to be awarded annually by the Webb Bros. (Webb’s school), and Mr. A. R. 
Carter has established a $100 scholarship to be given to some student from Louis- 
ville.  
-P-A-G-E-208
  164 HIGHER EDUCATION IN ‘TENNESSEE. 
They are given for scholarship, the two faculties determining the 
grounds of award. In the academic department the medal now passes 
from one school to another in rotation, following the order of the cata- 
logue, and is conferred for excellence in such work as may be assigned 
by the professor. The Crawford scholarship, established in 1886-87 by 
Robert L. Crawford, of New York, is a prize of $100 awarded annually 
to the best student in the junior class. In the years 1881, 1882, and 
1883 a hundred-dollar scholarship was given to the best undergraduate 
student in each school of the academic department. In 1880 six such 
scholarships had been given in certain combinations of schools. The 
three law scholarships were spoken of in the history of the law depart- 
ment. There are several minor medals and prizes in the professional 
departments. The commencement speakerships would come under the 
head of honors. There are three student speakers on commencement 
day—the two faculty representatives, who are chosen by the academic 
and biblical faculties from the graduating classes in their respective 
departments, and the class representative, who is elected from their 
own number by the graduating class of the academic department. No 
fellow or post-graduate student is allowed to compete for a medal or 
prize. 
. The prize principle may be a vicious one, but no great evils result 
from its operation at the Vanderbilt. The prizes are comparatively 
few in number; they stand for substantial acquirements, and they are 
won by the best men. There is complaint, and for this there is reason, 
that the system induces too much “cramming.” But this might be 
obviated by changing the grounds of award. Require an original paper 
of some kind from the competitors and base the decision both upon this 
and upon class standing. 
Two examinations a year are appointed, the intermediate at the mid- 
dle of the session and the final at its close. The professor may at his 
eption hold examinations oftener within the limits of his lecture hour. 
Accordingly the majority of the professors hold monthly examinations. 
The average obtained by combining the result of the examination with 
the daily average in recitations gives a student’s standing for the 
month. The average of the monthly standings for each half session, 
or the sessional standing as it is called, and the results of the inter- 
mediate and final examinations constitute the basis upon which the yearly 
standing isascertained. If astudent makes 89 or more out of a possible 
100 he is a first-grade or honor man; if he makes between 60 and 80 
he is a second-grade man; between 50 and 60 a third-grade man, and 
soon. The rule is that a grade of 60 is necessary to pass a student; 
that a grade of from 50 to 60 will condition him—that is, permit him to 
proceed with his class for the time being with the opportunity of re- 
trieving his failure in another examination—but that a grade lower 
than 50 is irretrievable failure and makes it necessary to take the sub- 
ject over again. Now, in ascertaining the yearly standing of a student
-P-A-G-E-209
VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY. 165 
ina given subject, greater weight is accorded to examinations than to 
sessional standing. Of course, if the average of the two sessional stand- 
ings and the average of the two examinations are both above 60 or 
both above 80 there is no trouble; but if one falls above and the other 
below the line it is not so easy a matter. If the examination, for ex- 
ample, is below 60 and the sessional standing above, the student is not 
passed. If the examination is above and the sessional standing below 
60, it is at the option of the professor to pass the student, and he 
will probably do so unless the sessional standing is very low. - 
Formerly no limit was put upon the Jength of the half-yearly exami- 
nations; but latterly the time has been restricted to five hours. Some 
of the professors are, however, prone to forget that any limitation has 
been imposed. The system of long examinations, if not the examina- 
tion system itself, is sometimes bitterly condemned by students in con- 
versation and in the college papers. It would seem that in this, as 
in so many other things, there is a golden mean. The system should 
be carefully guarded against excesses, but written examinations of 
moderate length and searching character should be retained. There is 
nothing like them to force a student to stop and survey the subject 
just gone over as a whole, codrdinating and integrating the parts and 
viewing the whole itself in its relation to other wholes. 
THE HONOR SYSTEM. 
The “honor system,” the origin of which is attributed to the Univer- 
* sity of Virginia, and which many southern schools and colleges have 
adopted, prevails at the Vanderbilt. The most important application 
of the principle is its application to written examinations. The student 
is required to sign a pledge at the end of his paper that he has neither 
given nor received assistance on the examination, but he is not watched; 
indeed, the professor sometimes leaves the room for an hour or more at 
atime. He may even, especially in the higher classes, leave and not 
come back at all, directing the students to lay their papers on his desk, 
or, perhaps, delegating one of their number to bring them to his resi- 
dence. In other words, the students are, as a matter of course, treated 
“as if they were honorable gentlemen, as incapable of dishonesty as the 
professors themselves; and they would resent any other treatment. 
Those who have breathed this atmosphere of mutual trust and respect 
would find any other suffocating and intolerable. But there is no 
doubt a certain amount of cheating on examinations. In every assem- 
plage of men there are a few of the baser sort who are insensible to 
appeals made to their higher nature; but these are seldom hardy 
enough to brave the strong public opinion that exists on the subject by 
open and flagrant cheating. Public opinion has expressed itself in ae- 
tion but twice. A number of years ago one of the Greek letter frater- 
nities expelled two members on the charge of cheating. They left the 
university. More recently some students in one of the professional de-
-P-A-G-E-210
    
  166 HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE. 
partments on the campus were accused of crookedness in examination. 
One or two of them were indicted, tried before a student jury, and 
acquitted. The faculty took no cognizance of the trial. Though re- 
sultless, it showed the temper of student sentiment, and served to clear 
the moral atmosphere in a most wholesome way. 
But the most impressive lesson ever given the students in this line was when 
the venerable chancellor announced one morning in tho ebapel that a certain grad- 
uate, whose name he did not call, had returned his diploma to the university. This 
graduate confessed that he had on a single occasion used forbidden help, and, 
though he had never been suspected and years had passed, he had never since had 
any peace of mind. He therefore returned his diploma and begged that his name be 
stricken from the roll of the alumni, preferring public disgrace rather than bear 
longer the burden of a secret sin. The chanceller had, after considering the case 
decided that the young man’s repentance and suffering had been a sufficient atone- 
ment for his error, and insisted on his retaining the diploma; but as the young 
man would not agree to this the chancellor had received back the diploma and cut 
out the name, so that the secret might die with him. No one who heard that 
impressive statement and saw the effect on the students could believe such a thing 
likely to oceur again as long as that tradition remained alive in the university. 
Among the good results of the honor system of examinations of the 
Vanderbilt may be mentioned these: The reduction of cheating in 
examinations to a minimum; “the enhancement in the value of college 
honors by removing from them all possible taint of fraud;” the estab- 
lishment of sincere and manly relations between teachers and pupils, 
and the elevation of the moral tone of the university. 
GOVERNMENT OF STUDENTS. 
The Vanderbilt employs the “honor” principle in the geverament of 
students and finds that government is made wonderfully more simple 
and easy. 
To quote from the by-laws, the management of the university 
“earnestly desires that the students may be influenced to good con- 
duct and diligence in study by higher motives than the coercion of law, 
and it mainly relies for the success of the university as a place of lib- 
eral education on moral and religious principle, @ sense of duty, and the 
generous feelings which belong to young-men engaged in honorable pur- 
suits.” Few restrictions are placed upon students, and no system of 
espionage or police is employed to enforecethem. <A student must 
attend his classes, and he must attend chapel whenever he has a class 
just before or after the chapel hour. As the faculty meets Tuesday 
afternoons, and important announcements are made the next morning, 
he is also required to attend chapel Wednesday morning. With these 
exceptions, a student’s time is his own both Sundays and week days. 
He is free to come and go when he pleases and to go where he pleases. 
He is his own master, responsible to himself alone, so long as he be- 
haves like a gentleman. Only when he forgets this responsibility, or 
is persistently neglectful of his duties, does the university interfere. 
It does this through the faculty and chanceller. If the offender heeds

not the admonition of the chancellor, his parents or his guardian are 
requested to withdraw him. Many have thus been withdrawn, but 
public expulsion has seldom, if ever, been resorted to. The ishibition 
of theater-going is one of the very few positive rules of conduct that 
have been laid down. For all the good it has done it might as weil 
never have been enacted. The theater law is out of harmony with the 
general policy of noninterference in matters of private opinion and 
judgment which obtains at the university. No real attempt is made 
to enforce it. In fact, it could not be enforced unless a detective or a 
police system were instituted. And this, we have seen, is repugnant 
to the spirit that prevades the university. 
The general character and moral tone of the student body has im- 
proved probably within the memory of recent graduates. Had the 
honor system of government and discipline been the false one, it is im- 
probable at least that this would have happened. There are, no doubt, 
many and various contributing causes. The chief and most obvious 
is the fact that a better class of men, better morally and mentally, come 
to the university now than formerly. Much of this may be attributed 
tothe preparatory schools. 
STUDENT SOCIETIES, ORGANIZATIONS, AND PUBLICATIONS, 
From the first the university provided halls in the main building for 
two literary societies, but it sternly forbade Greek-letter fraternities, 
These were the words used: 
While the literary societies provided for are thus recognized and encouraged, 
those perverted imitations of them which of late years have crept into some Ameri- 
can colleges and universities, known as secret societies, will not be tolerated. 
But “secret societies” came, and they staid, in spite of the ban placed 
upon them. In 1879 a law was passed debarring the members of frater- 
nities from the honors and degrees of the university. Included with 
these were the Young and founder’s medals in oratory, the competitors 
for which were elected by the literary societies. But the fraternities 
continued, even under such unpropitious circumstances, to exist and 
flourish sub rosa. The literary societies were controlled by fraternity 
cliques and combinations, and were the scenes of scramble and strife 
for offices and honors. 
Jn 1883 the authorities adopted a new plan of attack. They re- 
quired the literary societies to certify that the speakers elected by them 
tothe Young and founder’s contests were eligible under the law of the 
university. But this attempt to saddle the societies with the enforce- 
ment of the law failed completely. The Philosophie flatly refused to 
inquire into the “ private affairs” of its speakers and the Dialectic di- 
rected its officers to certify that, so far as the members of the society 
knew, those elected to speakership’s were eligible. Several representa- 
tives of the students and fraternities appeared before the board of 
trust at its meeting in May, 1883, and petitioned for the repeal of the
-P-A-G-E-212
  168 HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE. 
antifraternity law. In October, 1883, the law was repealed, but in a 
way intended to cover the retreat of the authorities and obviate the 
appearance of defeat. Inasmuch as the law had been designed princi- 
pally to guard the election of speakers for Young and founder’s medals, 
these elections were taken away from the societies and devolved onthe 
faculty. The law was not repealed in so many words, but no more was 
heard of it. At this time there were four fraternities running sub rosa 
Phi Delta Theta, Rainbow, Kappa Alpha, and Beta Theta Pi. The first 
three had chartered chapters founded in 1876, 1882, and 1883, respec- 
tively. The Betas had no charter, but carried on operations under the 
charter of Mu Chapter at Cumberland University, Lebanon. After the 
repeal of the law the charter which they could not get before was 
granted them February, 1884. Seven other fraternities have since the 
repeal of the law established chapters at the Vanderbilt: Chi Phi, 1883; 
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, 1883 (reéstablished in 1883, first established in 
1875); Kappa Sigma, 1885 (reéstablished in 1885, first established in 
1877); Delta Tau Delta, 1886; Sigmu Nu, 1886; Alpha Tau Omega, 
1889; and Delta Kappa Epsilon, 1889. The Sigma Nus have died out. 
The Vanderbilt chapter of Delta Tau Delta was formed by the merging 
of the Rainbow Chapter in Delta Tau Delta. 
The history of fraternities at most other colleges is no doubt their 
history at the Vanderbilt. They are neither an unmixed evil nor an 
unmixed good. Though they sometimes bring together uncongenial 
spirits, they are often the means of originating the noblest, most lasting, 
and most elevating friendships of a man’s life—friendships which but for 
the mystic ties of Greek brotherhood would never have been formed. The 
most obvious good done by the fraternities, strange to say, has been 
the result of the same spirit that has caused all the trouble in the lit 
erary societies, namely, fraternity pride and emulation. It is this that 
leads the different fraternities to contend for elective honors, and it is 
this that leads them to contend for scholarship honors. To personal 
ambition is added esprit de corps, and the two together are a powerful 
incentive to hard study. Rarely does a fellowship medal fall into the 
the hands of a “barbarian;” the honors of the university are almost 
always carried off by “Greeks.” One reason for this, of course, is that 
the fraternities gather in the great ‘majority of the best students. The 
department in which fraternities are strongest is the academic. Some 
of the professional departments are seldom invaded by them. Several 
fraternities that have no chapter at the Vanderbilt nevertheless have 
members there who joined at other colleges. In 1890-91 the fraterni- 
ties numbered 140 members among the students. None of them have 
chapter houses; all meet in rented rooms down town. They have 
asked for building space on the campus on which to erect chapter 
houses of their own. Most of them are not yet able to build. When 
they are the university will doubtless give them ground. 
Once there was much bad blood between fraternities and bitter feuds  
-P-A-G-E-213
    VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY. 169 
existed, engendered and fostered by the rivalry for place and the strug- 
gle for members; and sometimes the bad blood brought on blows. But 
allthis has passed away. Now there is little really bad feeling between 
fraternities. The moral tone of student life is higher. College patriot- 
ism is rising and swelling and lesser-patriotisms are being subsumed 
under this all-embracing patriotism. 
The literary societies are not what they should be. Many of the best 
men in the university never join them, and many men who do join neglect 
them. The attainments of their members as such are not eemmensurate 
with the attainments of their members as students. If the Vanderbilt 
were less of a university, things might be different. As it is, the pro- 
fessional and post-graduate schools, the athletic associations and other 
organizations—the many and diverse interests of a large institution— 
attract and employ the energies of students, who have more serious 
business, they think, than literary society declamation. The baneful 
influence of the fraternities on the societies did not cease when the 
faculty assumed the election of contestants for Young and founder’s 
medals. Some loaves and fishes there were still—the Observer man- 
agership and editorships, places on the “capitol” contest, on the an- 
nual Thanksgiving debate between the societies, on the anniversary 
program for February 22, and on declaimers’ contests. In December, 
1887, a third literary society, the Garland Lyceum, was established 
with the avowed purpose of excluding all fraternity men. It was admit- 
ted by the other societies to ashare in the ownership and management 
ofthe Observer. But either there was not room for three societies, or 
the antifraternity spirit waned, or the new society was founded on too 
narrow a principle; for the Garland Lyceum perished in less than a 
year and a half. 
In 1890~91 the literary societies withdrew from the State Intercol- 
legiate Oratorical Association, which held annual contests in the State 
capitol at Nashville, and joined in the formation of a Southern inter- 
collegiate oratorical association, of which the University of Virginia, 
the Vanderbilt, and afew other Southern colleges became members. In 
the contests of the State Association each society hada representative; 
in the Southeru Association the two together have only one. 
The first election is noteworthy as marking a wonderful growth of 
college spirit. There happened what had never happeneéd before in an 
important election—a unanimous choice. For the once Vanderbilt 
students forgot that they were partisans of this or that particular in- 
terest and remembered only that they were members of one body—their 
college. They sent their best speaker to Charlottesville, where the 
first contest was held, and he came off victorious. 
The first student paper was the Vanderbilt Austral, an outlawed. 
sheet published by law students, who, because they were law students, 
considered themselves not to be amenable to the prohibition of the 
authorities. Permission to publish a college paper had been refused

  170 HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE. 
twice on the ground that the time was premature. But in 1879 the 
literary societies were granted permission to publish a magazine on 
conditions approved by the faculty. Thus began the Vanderbilt 
Observer, a monthly magazine, the joint property and charge of the 
two societies. The principal positions are those of editor in chief and 
business manager. Both are never filled at the same time by members 
of the same society, and they each alternate from one society to the 
other. Besides these positions there are several minor editorships 
which are divided between the societies. The business manager is 
the only man on the magazine who is paid. Formerly he was allowed 
$100 a year; now he receives a certain percentage of the profits. The 
Observer is the literary organ of the students, and, although it has 
often failed to enlist their best talent, it is much more fairly represent- 
ative of their mental capacity and attainments than is the work of the 
literary societies. 
The Hustler was established in the fall of 1888, a four-page weekly. 
It was a private venture, an independent sheet, edited and published 
by a few students representing no particular interest, some of them fel- 
lows and instructors in the university. Its name indicated its newsy, 
aggressive character. It was ably edited and was something of a free 
lance, bold and fearless in its utterances and not afraid to criticise the 
powers that were. It was not published in 1889~90, but was revived 
in 1890-91, not, however, without being subjected to asort of censorship. 
The athletic association will publish it the coming year. Inasmuch as 
Wesley Hall has sent numbers of missionaries to foreign fields, it is not 
inept that it should publish a missionary journal. The Wesley Hall 
Missionary is edited by Profs. Smith and Martin, of the biblical depart- 
ment, The Comet, so called in honor of E. E. Barnard, who spread the 
fame of the university by his many discoveries of comets, is the college 
annual issued jointly by the fraternities, each of which is represented 
on the board of editors. The first Comet was published in 1887. 
The name of the Vanderbilt Engineering Club is a sufficient index to 
its character. The Young Men’s Christian Association has a large 
membership. The alumni association meets every year during com- 
tmencement week to transact business, to carry out its annual pro- 
gram of analumni poem and an alumni address, and to gather round 
the banquet board. It has lately undertaken to found a fellowship in 
the university. Two alumni hold seats in the board of trust. The 
board has made two small appropriations for the benefit of the associa- 
tion, one of them being to aid its historian, Dr. J. T. McGill, in prepar- 
ing sketches of the alumni. Frequent complaints have been made that 
the board does not accord due recognition and consideration to the 
association. 
The university has on the whole been liberal in its treatment of ath- 
letics. A finely equipped gymnasium, in charge of acompetentinstructor, 
has been previded and attendance made obligatory upon biblical and

academic students. The presidentof the athletic association has always 
been chosen from the faculty. The Vanderbilt Athletic Association 
was organized in 1886 and observed its first annual field day in May of 
the same year. The field-day sports are open to any college in the State. 
Cumberland University, the University of Nashville, the University of 
the South, Southwestern Presbyterian University, and the University of 
Tennessee have all at ene time or other entered one or more of the sports. - 
In bringing together on diamond and running track the representatives 
of so many institutions the Vanderbilt Athletie Association is doing a 
great service to college athletics in Tennessee. Membership fees and 
field-day admission receipts have more than met the expenses of the 
association and in its bank account the credits overbalance the debits: 
It has just established a post-graduate scholarship and has put shower 
baths in the gymnasium. <A great need of the association is regular 
athletic grounds. The lawn-tennis association, organized about the 
same time as the athletic association, has excellent grounds at one end 
of the campus, on which it has built a club house. The Vanderbilt 
has enjoyed the benefits and escaped the evils of athletics. They have 
not led to neglect of studies, some of the best students having been 
some of the best athletes. They have furnished a common ground to 
students of different departments, different classes, and different fra- 
ternities, and the common interests centering there have done much to 
ereate a beneficial college spirit. 
COEDUCATION OF THE SEXES. 
In theory Vanderbilt University is not. coeducational, but there are 
always a few women in some of her classes. They are, however, mostly 
irregular students, a very small proportion of them taking full and regu- 
lar courses. Lady students do net matriculate, their names do not appear 
in the university register; in a technical sense, they are not students at 
all. And yet no woman is ever denied admission to any class she may 
desire to enter. She listens to lectures and attends recitations just as 
any male student. Formerly she enjoyed these advantages free of 
eharge, but now she has to pay certain fees. If she fulfills the require- 
ments for a degree, the fact that she is a woman does not hinder the 
university from conferring the degree upon her. Only two women, 
however, have ever completed a degree course—Miss Kate Lupton and 
Miss Dora Johnson. The former received M. A. in 1879, the latter B. 
A. in 1891. In 1890-91 one of the scholastic fellowships was held by 
a lady graduate of Cornell. 
In 1887 the faculty unanimously recommended that women be admit- 
ted to the university on exactly the same terms as men, and that none 
but those so admitted be permitted to attend classes. But the board 
of trust twice postponed action on the recommendation and then de- 
ferred action indefinitely by adopting the report of its committee to — 
 
-P-A-G-E-216

the effect that plausible reasons existed for future but not for present 
eoeducation. And thus the matter rests. People in the South are 
hardly prepared, if they will ever be, for open and avowed coeducation 
of the sexes, and the prevailing student sentiment seemed to be against 
it afew years ago when the subject was under discussion. The ques- 
tion, it may be, will solve itself. As it is now being worked out women 
are slipping easily and gradually into place side by side with men. 
But if the doors were suddenly thrown wide open, the change would 
be so abrupt as to possibly render difficult the adjustment of relations. 
INFLUENCE OF CHURCH CONNECTIONS. 
The members of the board of trust are all Methodists, and they natu- 
rally have no other wish than that the president, and perhaps the chan- 
cellor, shall always be of the same denomination. But in filling profes- 
sorships they have not confined themselves to their own church. Of 
the sixteen professors and adjunct professors of the academic and engi- 
neering departments, departments that are closely correlated, twelve 
are Methodists, two are Episcopalians, one is a Presbyterian, and one 
is a member of no church at all. In filling instructorships and fellow- 
ships no regard whatever is had to church affiliations. But the general 
policy of the university must in some respects inevitably be influenced 
by its connection with the church. And this influence is magnified to 
its hurt. At the same time that the connection secures it a large and 
faithful constituency, that constituency is not so extensive and not so 
composite as it would be if the university had no church connection. 
The internal administration of the university is entirely free from 
sectarianism. In its early years students were required to attend 
Sunday services in the chapel. But the requirement was abolished, 
and now a student has only himself to consult whether he shall go to 
church and where he shall go. Every year the chancellor advises 
students to worship with the church of their fathers. The whole 
tendency of university life is against drawing sharp religious, political, 
and social lines. The general tone is one of breadth and liberality. It 
is an atmosphere in which one breathes freely, sure that he is esteemed 
for what he is rather than for his wealth or his social standing, his 
religious or his political belief.

in Spanish; Hanns Oertel, pu. D., graduate fellow and assistant in Greek; W. H.

and assistant in English; C. D. Rice, assistant in mathematics; and Paul M. Jones, 
B. 8., graduate fellow and assistant in natural history and geology. 
An examination of this list of: professors will reveal the creation of 
new schools and the expansion of old ones, as well as the abolition of 
some. Modern languages, English, history, and economies have seen 
the greatest changes. The new study of English, both literary and 
philological, has been taken up in the most thorough-going manner. 
Formerly attached to the School of Modern Languages, English is 
now a school of itself, and, moreover, the most largely attended school 
in the university. The chair of modern languages has lately been 
divided into two chairs, that of romance and that of Teutonic languages. 
Until recently histozy and political economy received the scant atten- 
tion accorded them in most colleges, finding a domicile in almost any 
schocl that would give them shelter. But in 1889 they were severed 
from mental and moral philosophy and erected into a separate school. 
The professors have on the average only about twelve lectures and 
recitations per week. They are thus afforded time and opportunity 
for scholarly investigation and writing. Since the standing and repu- 
tation of college professors in the present day depend so much upon 
their work as scholars, the importance of this is readily seen.

EDWARD EMERSON BARNARD, THE ASTRONOMER. 
It was Vanderbilt University that nursed the young genius of 
Edward Emerson Barnard. The Vanderbilt Observatory was the first 
observatory in which he ever worked. He had charge of it from 1883 
to 1887. He was first fellow and afterwards instructor in astronomy.
-P-A-G-E-226
  182 : HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE. 
Being without @ college education he set about to acquire one, attending 
classes and standing examinations just like any other student. His 
mathematical studies he carried so far as to graduate in that school. By 
his many comet discoveries Prof. Barnard made himself famous and at 
the same time spread the name of the university. And he achieved 
his wonderful results with instruments designed not for original work, 
but simply for instruction in practical astronomy. In 1887 he accepted 
the position of astronomer of the Lick Observatory, Mount Hamilton, 
Cal., where he is now. With the unequaled facilities of the Lick at 
his command Prof. Barnard is continually adding luster to his name. 
Prof. Barnard’s specialty has been comet and nebular work. The 
following is a list of his comet discoveries: 1881, v1; 1882, 111; 1884, 
Ii (periodic—fifty-three years); 1885, 11; 1886, 11; 1886, vi11; 1886, 1x; 
1887, 111; 1887, Iv; 1888, v; 1889, 1; 1889, 11; 1889, 111; 1890, V (redis- 
covery of @Arrest's periodic comet); 1891, a; 1891, ‘ (rediscovery of 
Wolf’s periodic comet); 1891, ¢ (rediscovery of Encke’s periodic comet) ; 
1891, d (rediscovery of Swift's periodic comet); 1891, e; 1885, V (inde- 
este discovered). This list is greater than that of any other 
living astronomer and is equaled only by that of Pons, whose list was 
larger.! In 1889 Prof. Barnard discovered four satellite comets, which 
~ were traveling through space with comet 1889, v. 
He has discovered something over one hundred new nebule and some 
five or six double stars, one of which (connected with the trapezium of 
Orion) is the most difficult double star in the heavens. He discov- 
ered in 1890 a new Merope nebula, a bright nebula only 36 seconds of 
are from the bright star Merope of the Pleiades. 
He made the first photographs of the Milky Way that were ever 
made to show the cloud forms and structures, 1889. He also made the 
only observations on record that prove beyond question that the dusky 
ring of Saturn is transparent, eclipse of Japetus, November 1, 1889. 
Prof. Barnard has inade a special study for the past twelve years of 
the planet Jupiter, and has published many papers ee these 
studies and observations. 
He has published many independent papers and written for many 
astronomical publications. He is a contributor to the following jour- 
nals: Astronomische Nachrichten, Monthly Notices Royal Astronom- 
ical Society, Astronomical Journal, Sidereal Messenger, Publications 
Astronomical Society of the Pacific. He also contributes in a popular 
form to the newspapers. 
Prof. Barnard was made a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society 
in 1887, and a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement 
of Science in 1885. He is, besides, a member of the British Astronom- 
ical Association and of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific. 
'Prof. Barnard is now only 34 years old.

RELATIVE PLACES OF BOARD OF TRUST, CHANCELLOR, AND FACULTY 
IN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY. 
“The general government of Vanderbilt University is vested in its 
board of trust.” “The executive committee has the power ad interim 
that is delegated to it by the board of trust.” “The immediate govern-: 
ment is committed to the chancellor and the faculty in each of the sey- 
eral departments. All matters pertaining to the common interests of 
the institution are considered by the university senate, composed of 
the chancellor and the deans.” ‘The chancellor is ev officio chairman 
of the faculty. He is also to preside on public academic occasions, con- 
fer the degrees at commencement, and at every annual meeting of the 
board of trust to acquaint that body with the state, interests, and wants 
of the university.”' He is admitted to the deliberations of the board, 
but he may not vote. The chancellor is an executive officer, executing 
laws of the board of trust as well as ordinances of the faculty; a go- 
between for faculty and board, through whom all communications from 
the former to the latter must pass, accompanied by his written opinion, 
and for all ordinary purposes the head of the university. Though the 
general government is vested in the board of trust, the faculty has a 
very real if not a formal share in that government. Plans and policies 
originate there, and as a rule its recommendations are adopted. 
THE RESIGNATION OF CHANCELLOR GARLAND.” 
At the last meeting of the board of trust Chancellor Garland pre- 
sented his resignation. It was accepted, to take effect on the election 
and installment of his successor. No successor has yet been named. 
Dr. Garland will retire on a full salary as emeritus chancellor for life, 
And thus will end a connection that has been fraught with great and 
lasting good to the Vanderbilt. In its upbuilding Dr. Garland has 
been no small factor. His experience as college professor and presi- 
dent, stretching back now sixty years; his ability and his scholarship, 
and, beyond all, his grand character, have been a tower of strength. 
His presence has inspired confidence; it has been a guarantee of genu- 
ineness and stability. Dr. Garland is a gentleman of the old school, 
with all that that implies in manners and attainments, a product of the   
1 From the by-laws of the university. 
? Landon Cabell Garland was born in 1810 in Nelson County, Va.; graduated from 
Hampden-Sidney College in 1829; was professor of chemistry in Washington College, 
Va., from 1830 to 1833; was professor of physics in Randolph-Macon College from 
1833 to 1835, when he became president; left Randolph-Macon in 1847 to fill the pro- 
fessorship of English literature in the University of Alabama; was soon transferred 
to the chair of mathematics, physics, and astronomy; in 1854~’55 was president of 
the Northeast and Southwest Railroad Company, a corporation organized to build a 
railroad from Meridian, Miss., to Wills Valley, Ala.; in 1855 was elected president 
of the University of Alabama; in 1866 went to the University of Mississippi as pro- 
fessor of physics and astronomy, where he remained until he became chancellor of 
Vanderbilt University in 1875.

time when there were fewer specialists and, it may be, more all-round 
scholars. Such he is himself. He is fond of telling his students that 
pure mathematics is his forte, and yet he has taught, and of course 
with success, not only mathematics, but physics, astronomy, mental, 
moral, and political science, and even English literature. Years ago he 
wrote and published a trigonometry and wrote a calculus, but the 
unpublished manuscript was lost in the burning of his house. In the 
art of teaching he is a master. It is a favorite saying of his that his 
method is the Socratic method. The simplicity and clearness of his 
exposition, step by step and principle by principle, from the very foun- 
dation to the capstone, is truly admirble and could hardly be excelled. 
In his younger days Dr. Garland had the reputation of being an orator 
of much eloquence, and in his old age his tongue has not forgot her 
cunning. His voice at a moderate pitch can be heard in the distant 
recesses of a large hall. He speaks readily if not fluently, and his use 
and choice of words are almost faultless. His command of language 
and his command of himself make him a good extemporaneous and 
occasional speaker. His manner is simple and direct; he affects none 
of the arts of the orator. He appeals straight to the higher nature, to 
what of goodness and truth there isina man. The honor system of 
government has found in him a sympathetic administrator, and to him 
its suecess is largely due. At the last commencement he gave in a 
most impressive manner his testimony to the efficacy of that system. 
He felt that this might be his last public utterance from the university 
rostrum, and that utterance was an expression of his profound and 
thankful conviction that young men could be governed by relying upon 
their sense of duty and honor, Dr. Garland is deeply religious; and 
religion with him means an abiding trust in his Heavenly Father and 
constant resort to Him in prayer. The burden of his chapel talks to 
students is the transcendent importance of religion and of high moral 
character. Dr. Garland is not a magnetic man; he is not as sympa- 
thetic as some men. His influence does not lie here; it lies in his mod- 
esty and simplicity, in his moral sweetness and purity, in his unswery- 
ing integrity and devotion to duty. These things inspire respect and 
confidence; they make him a force for good. They are green spots in 
one’s memory; they are helpful influences in one’s life.

CHAPTER V. 
CUMBERLAND UNIVERSITY. 
CUMBERLAND COLLEGE. 
Cumberland University is the leading educational institution of the 
Cumberland Presbyterian Church. The first educational institution 
of the church was Cumberland College, situated at Princeton, Ky., 
and opened in March, 1826. The chief purpose in founding this 
pioneer school was to meet the demand in the church for ministerial 
education. But it was not successful, particularly in its financial 
management. At last the general assembly of the church decided 
to sever the connection previously existing between the college and 
itself and to transfer its countenance and support to a school to be 
established at “‘a more eligible site.” 
A commission appointed by the assembly met in Nashville, July, 
1842, to choose a location for the new school. Lebanon, Tenn., made 
the best offer—to erect a $10,000 building and present it to the school— 
and was accordingly selected as the seat of the proposed college. 
Besides the greater liberality shown by the citizens of Lebanon, they 
were known to be arefined and sultivated people. Moreover, Lebanon 
was a center of Cumberland Presbyterian influence. 
The management and friends of the discarded Cumberland College 
formed a large and vigorous minority in the general assembly, but 
their remonstrances were of no avail. After it was turned adrift by 
the general assembly Cumberland College entered upon a more useful 
and successful career. “Green River Synod took the cast-off child 
under its care” and the school remained an institution of the Cumber- 
land Presbyterian Church until 1858. 
CUMBERLAND UNIVERSITY OPENED. 
The new college began work in a very humble way, in September, 
1842, in the Cumberland Presbyterian Church of Lebanon. For a while 
the only teachers were Rev. C. G. McPherson, professor of mathematics, 
and one of the older students. In February, 1843, President I’. R. Cos- 
sitt, D. D., and Tutor T. N. Jarman arrived. Rev. T. C, Anderson, pro- 
fessor of Latin and Greek, entered upon his duties in September, 1843, 
Tt was not until September, 1844, that N. Lawrence Lindsley, professor 
of modern languages, met his classes and thus completed the org \niza- 
tion of the faculty. Instruction was given in temporary quarters until 
186

the opening of the fifth session in September, 1844, when the school was 
moved into the now completed college building. By a charter ob- 
tained from the legislature in February, 1844, the school became Cum- 
berland University. Its promoters already had in view the grouping of 
special schools around a literary department, or college proper, as a 
center. 
LIMITED MEANS OF THE UNIVERSITY. 
At the outset and repeatedly afterwards the trustees declared that 
neither they themselves individually nor the property of the university 
were liable for professors’ salaries. If tuition fees and endowment 
income were not sufficient to meet them, they must remain unpaid until 
a surplus from these sources over and above current expenses should 
arise; and this was not likely to occur. As a consequence theincomes 
of professors were small, verysmall. Yetmen of scholarship and ability 
graced the halls of Cumberland University. To their unselfish devotion 
to the cause of the institution, must be attributed a large part of its 
success. The whole history of the university has been a struggle against 
limited means. Whatever has been accomplished has been accom- 
plished despite this drawback. Even now the endowment is very 
meager. The revenues derived from tuition fees supplemented by pri- 
vate donations, always precarious and obtained at the cost of much 
time and expense, have constituted the main support of the college. 
But for faithful agents laboring against almost insuperable obstacles 
throughout the wide bounds of the church, Cumberland University must 
at times have closed its doors. One of the most successful agents was 
Rey. John M. McMurry, appointed in 1845. He worked for several 
years with such success that the endowment was increased to $60,000. 
The plan usually followed by him was to secure “endowment notes.” 
The giver of the note paid interest on it during his lifetime; the prin- 
cipal fell due at his death. Often the principal was never paid, and it 
required no little trouble and expense to collect the interest fron. men 
scattered through several States. 
PREPARATORY DEPARTMENT. 
A preparatory school has always been connected with the university 
and its students have been numbered as university students. Until 
1850 it was taught by students belonging to the higher college classes. 
Since that time it has had regular instructors. One of them, William 
J. Grannis, A. M., has been a teacher in the school for. thirty-eight 
years. 
From the first, ministerial students of any evangelical denomination 
were exempted in all the departments from the payment of tuition fees. 
In addition to this the liberality of some 12 or 15 residents of Lebanon 
and vicinity provided free board for those who were unable to pay.
-P-A-G-E-232
188 HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE. 
CONSTITUTION OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES, 
The board of trustees is local and self-perpetuating, but by an amend- 
ment to the charter passed by the legislature during the session of 
1849~50 nominations to vacancies in the board must be approved by 
the general assembly of the church or by the synod in which the uni- 
versity is situated. Although composed mostly of Cumberland Pres- 
byterians, the usefulness and influence of the board have been extended 
by the presence of a few who were not members of that church. James 
C. Jones was one of these. He was the “lean Jimmie Jones” who was 
twice elected governor of Tennessee over James K. Polk and was after- 
wards sent to the United States Senate. Foremost, and deservedly 
foremost, among the legal guardians of the university’s interests was 
Robert L. Caruthers, president of the board of trustees from its organ- 
ization until his death in 1882. 
In all noble plans for the advancement of the institution’s interests this man led 
the way. If he had been what the world now calls wealthy the university would 
long ago have been fully endowed. His estate was large enough to enable him to 
place his name at the head of every subscription paper circulated to raise money for 
the institution. He led not only in liberal giving, but in planning liberal things. He 
scorned all littleness and meanness of policy in the management of the college busi- 
ness.

CHANGES IN PRESIDENCY AND FACULTY—SKETCH OF PROFESSORS. 
In 1844 Dr. Cossitt resigned the presidency, and was succeeded by 
Prof. Anderson, who had recently retired from the chair of ancient lan- 
guages on account of ill health. Prof. Lindsley was transferred to the 
vacant chair from the chair of modern languages; Alexander P. Stew- 
art was elected to the professorship of mathematics in 1845, vice C. G. 
McPherson, resigned. James H. Sharp was elected, also in this year, 
to the chair of physical sciences. He was succeeded in 1848 by James 
M. Safford, pu. D., of Yale College. William Mariner, A. M., professor 
of mathematics in West Tennessee College, was made assistant pro- 
fessor of ancient languages at the end of 1847. He subsequently filled 
for some time the chair of mathematics. He was finally assigned, in 
1850, to the chair of ancient languages, made vacant by the death of 
Prof. Lindsley. Prof. Anderson, notwithstanding he was a confirmed 
invalid, continued at the head of the university for twenty-two years. 
“Tn his administration as the presiding officer of the affairs of the 
leading institution of the church, his course was distinguished by a 
genial, magnanimous, liberal, and Christian view of his great respon- 
sibilities and duties. He was preéminently noted for practical wisdom 
in his dealings with all the interests of the university, common sense 
being one of his peculiar characteristics in all matters of counsel, 
whether public or private.” Dr. Lindsley, although not in the faculty 
many years, left tlfe mark of his character and culture upon the insti- 
tution. He had sat under the instruction of his famous father, Philip
-P-A-G-E-233
  
CUMBERLAND UNIVERSITY. 189 
Lindsley. Indeed, “as an educator, he possessed in an eminent degree 
the two great qualities so wonderfully adorning his distinguished 
father’s life, to wit: thorough, exact, profound, classic culture, and the 
faculty of inspiring an enthusiastic devotion toward himself in all his 
scholars.” 
Prof. Stewart was a graduate of West Point and when called to 
Lebanon was assistant professor of mathematics in his alma mater. 
With the exception of three years, he was a member of the Lebanon 
faculty until the breaking out of the war in 1861, when he entered the 
Confederate army and rose to the position of lieutenant-general. The 
stern and rigid ideas of faithfulness and duty with which Stewart be- 
came imbued at West Point were communicated through him to his 
pupils. ‘He commanded their highest respect at all times and left 
the distinct impression of his high character as a stimulus and a model 
for their afterthought through life.” Prof. Safford’s election was due 
to the warm endorsement of Benjamin Silliman, “ the nestor of Ameri- 
ean science.” In 1854 Prof. Safford received the appointment of State 
geologist of Tennessee and resumed the geological survey begun by 
Gerard Troost. His “Geology of Tennessee,” published in 1869, gave 
him a high standing among scientific men both in Europe and America. 
DEPRESSION—REVIVAL. 
The first catalogue of the university was issued in 1845 and showed 
a roll of 82 students, 16 of whom were candidates for the ministry. 
The institution received a check in 1849. The complete severance of 
the relations existing between Dr. Lindsley and the university, the 
resignation of Prof. Stewart and the presence of the cholera in 
Lebanon all united to cast a gloom over the prospects of the univer- 
sity. But in 1850 things began to assume a brighter look. Prof. 
Stewart returned to his professorship, the patronage increased, and 
Cumberland University entered upon an era of prosperity that was to 
last until the beginning of civil strife ten years later. 
CREATION OF DEPARTMENTS OF ENGINEERING AND THEOLOGY. 
Two new departments, or schools, were created in 1852—engineering 
and theology. This year a short course leading to the degree of civil 
engineer was established. A student with little or no preparation 
could complete it in two or three years, while one well prepared could, 
complete it in one or two years. At first Prof. Stewart had entire 
charge of the department. In 1854 A. H. Buchanan was associated 
with him. Prof. Buchanan, who since the resignation of Prof. Stewart 
in 1869 has had both mathematics and engineering, has been for 
several years in charge of the geodetic survey of Tennessee under the 
direction of the U. 8. Coast Survey. 
Lectures on various theological subjects had been given for several 
years by President Anderson and others. In 1852 the general assem-
-P-A-G-E-234
  190 HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE. 
bly established a school of theology. In 1853 Richard Beard, D. D., 
president of Cumberland College, was elected professor of systematic 
theology, but not until he entered upon his duties in March, 1854, was 
the theological department fully organized. There being as yet no en- 
dowment for this department, and no tuition fees being paid by its 
students, private individuals pledged themselves to the payment of Dr. 
Beard’s salary. 
For many years Dr. Beard performed the arduous labors of the theo- 
logical school alone and unaided except for the irregular assistance of 
the president of the college and the pastor of the Lebanon congrega- 
tion. In addition he did much of the work in the school of ancient 
languages, not being wholly relieved of this until 1872. 
The theological school grew slowly in numbers and endowment. 
Apparently the church cared little for it. At times Dr. Beard lost faith, 
but he again took courage and “went on with his half-paid labors all 
the remainder of his life.” He died in 1881. Dr. Beard stood high in 
his church as scholar and writer. His work on systematic theology is 
regarded as “the crytallization of Cumberland Presbyterian thought 
and faith.” 
The following from Dr. B. W. McDonnold’s “History of the Cumber- 
land Presbyterian Church” shows the relation which the theological 
school sustains to the university: 
Not the trustees of the university, but the general assembly, planned and inaugu- 
rated this department. Cumberland University did not even ask the general assem- 
bly to establish such a department. *. * * Itis notand never was a mere depart- 
ment of the university. It stands in relations far different from those sustained by 
the law department. Tho latter was created by the trustees at Lebanon, and could 
be abandoned by them without asking the church or the general assembly. The 
church’s theological school is a department of the university only so far as such re- 
lation is supposed to be serviceable to this school, but it is something more than a 
mere department. It has relations independent of the university. The propriety of 
having a separate board of trustees forit has often been discussed, but its own interests 
are against such a separation. The charter for this department differs greatly in its 
provisions from the charters of the other departments. 
The following test is required of professors in the theological school: 
Each professor, before entering upon the duties of his office, shall solemnly adopt, 
in such form as the assembly may prescribe, the Cumberland Presbyterian confes- 
sicn of faith and form of government. 
COLLEGE BUILDING ENLARGED. 
The attendance upon the university had now grown to such propor- 
tions as to make more ample accommodations necessary. Rey. T. C. 
Blake was accordingly sent out in 1856 to raise a building fund. His 
scheme was to sell fifteen-year scholarships at $500 each. The money 
obtained in this way was to be used in enlarging the college building. 
The building was to contain dormitories, and the rent of these was to 
go to the endowment fund. The money donated on this plan was thus 
at the same time a building fund and an endowment fund. A sufficient

CUMBERLAND UNIVERSITY. — 191 
sum was realized by it to make the college building one of the largest 
and most stately in Tennessee. Upon it there seemed to rest the halo 
of a happy and useful future. In 1858 there were 481 young men from 
all over the South crowded its halls. 
THE CIVIL WAR. 
In the great conflict between North and South the officers and stu- 
dents of the university were, many of them, found in the thick of the 
fight, some on one side, some on the other. But most of them, as we 
would expect, enlisted under the bars and stars. Cumberland Univer- 
sity, like many colleges in the South, suffered the direst calamities of 
war. Her library and endowment were swept away. By the order of 
one of her own sons, a Confederate major, who affected great indigna- 
tion that his alma mater should have been made barracks for negro 
soldiers, her buildings were burned and nothing was left but a few 
lonely columns pointing heavenward amidst a mass of débris. An 
alumnus of the university, wandering through the ruins, wrote on one 
of these columns the word “resurgam!” In after days the prophesy 
was fulfilled. 
UNIVERSITY REOPENED. 
The close of the war found the university not only with hardly acent 
of property, but with numerous debts hanging over it. Among 
these were the claims for free tuition, based on the possession of build- 
ing scholarships purchased before the war. As the buildings were now 
in ashes, there was absolutely nothing to compensate the faculty for 
instruction given to the holders of these scholarships. Notwithstand- 
ing the gloomy outlook, Dr. Beard and Prof. Anderson opened a school 
in the fall of 1865 in a rented hall. In this bare and dreary place they 
taught for a year, with how many students is not known. Dr. Ander- 
son resigned in 1866, and Dr. B. W. McDonnold was called to the double 
duty of paster of the Lebanon Church and teacher of mathematics and 
sciences. 
It was about this time that the board of trustees purchased the for- 
mer residence of Abraham Caruthers for the law department. Ten 
thousand dollars was the price agreed upon. Soon after the war Rev. 
T. C. Blake was sent out to raise a building fund. He secured about 
$30,000, chiefly in building notes. The purchase of the Caruthers prop- 
erty created such dissatisfaction that many subscribers to the building 
fund refused to pay their notes. The secret of their action was no 
doubt a feeling that the law school should not be the first department 
of the university to receive the assistance necessary to put it on its 
feet. 
The forty-first term opened in the fall of 1866 with Dr. Beard, 
Dr. MeDonnold, and one of the students as instructors. Gen. A. 
P. Stewart had been elected president, but delayed his answer for
-P-A-G-E-238
192 HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE. 
several months. At last he declined the position and Dr. MeDonnold 
was elected. Before the close of the year Gen. Stewart was again 
called, this time to the chair of mathematics. He did not decline this 
position, but accepted and held it until 1869, when he resigned, and A. 
H. Buchanan was elected in his place. Dr. Safford was also recalled to 
his old chair of physical sciences. The forty-third term thus began 
with a tolerably full faculty. 
The collegiate department now occupied the Caruthers building. 
The trustees had thought to conciliate the donors of the building notes 
by transferring the Caruthers property to the collegiate department, 
but all to no purpose, for the opening of the college upon this property 
seemed a deliberate abandonment of the intention to rebuild on the old 
site. With many this was doubtless a mere plea to ease their con- 
sciences. At an expense of $6,000 the buildings were fitted up for col- 
lege purposes. But only $2,000 had been paid on the purchase money. 
At last the courts condemned the property to be sold. The theological 
school stepped in and boughtit for $8,000, thus saving to the university 
the $8,000 already expended. This was done, of course, at the expense 
of the collegiate department and at the gain of the theological depart- 
ment. Had it not been for this fortunate issue of an unfortunate piece 
of business the university would have been without house and home. 
PRESIDENT M’DONNOLD. 
When Dr. McDonnold entered upon the presidency he dispensed with 
all printed laws for the government of students and laid down instead 
the eminently sensible rule, ““Every student must behave himself like 
a gentleman, and must know his lessons.” There has been no variation 
from this policy since it was first enunciated by Dr. McDonnold. All 
departments are treated alike. 
Dr. McDonnold labored incessantly for the upbuilding of the insti- 
tution of which he was the head. No sacrifice that would further its 
interests was too great for him to make. It was the purpose of the uni- 
versity to maintain an efficient faculty. But how could it be done with- 
out funds? This was the task to which Dr. MeDonnold specially ap- 
plied himself. Besides keeping agents in the field he enlisted by an 
extensive system of correspondence the codperation of the ministry, 
wrote articles for the church publications, and visited in person as- 
semblies, presbyterics, and synods. He directed his efforts partly 
towards securing a permanent endowment, partly towards securing a 
“cash endowment.” Contributions to the cash endowment were not for 
investment, but for meeting annual expenses, particularly professors’ 
salaries. This was how a faculty composed of good men was sustained. 
The university was again on the road to prosperity. “Resurgam” 
had become a reality. 
The debts had been paid and the endowment was steadily growing. 
In 1870-71 the attendance reached 335, but various novel schemes were

  CUMBERLAND. UNIVERSITY. £93 
now afloat for raising anendowment. The methods of Dr. MceDonnold 
and his colaborers were sound and prudent, it was true, but then they 
did not realize results fast enough. The university must find some 
shorter path to financial prosperity. To these were doubtless added, 
in the minds of some, selfish pecuniary motives. 
The favorite plan was the insurance plan. According to this policies 
in life insurance companies were to be taken out in favor of the univer- 
sity. On the death of the policy holder the policy would be paid into 
the treasury of the endowment fund. Many who advocated this plan 
were friends of the university and perfectly honest in their belief. 
Nevertheless, Dr. McDonnold, supported by Prof. Green and others, 
uncompromisingly resisted all efforts to foist this and other schemes 
upon the university. It was only by taking advantage of Dr. McDon- 
nold’s absence in Alabama that the insurance men at last triumphed. 
Col. B. F, Ball, an agent of the St. Louis Mutual Life Insurance Com- 
pany, and at the same time a prominent Cumberland Presbyterian and 
a true friend of the university, obtained a sort of semiendorsement of 
his scheme from the general assembly, and also prevailed upon the 
trustees of the university to adopt it. Thus was Dr. McDonnold’s wise 
and conservative policy superseded by one of doubtful value. “The 
trustees claimed for the agents of the insurance companies a clear 
field, not permitting any other method of raising money for permanent 
endowment or allowing the collection of cash contributions to supple- 
ment salaries.” The crash came before long. After thousands of dol- 
lars had been paid in premiums and before the university had received 
any real benefit the insurance company failed. The worry incident to 
this insurance business, the success of the insurance men, and the 
quickly following disaster broke down the health of Dr. McDonnold, 
never a strong man physically. After an ineffectual attempt to bear 
up under his illness he resigned the presidency in 1873. 
CHANCELLOR NATHAN GREEN, JR. 
There was now no “cash endowment” from which to pay for the serv- 
ices of a president. But in Nathan Green, jr., of the law faculty, was 
found aman willing to perform without increase of salary the duties 
attaching to this office in addition to those belonging to his professor- 
ship. He was accordingly elected chancellor, corresponding closely to 
the former president, and has ever since served in that capacity. 
He at once introduced several changes. He did away with com- 
mencement speeches from members of the graduating classes and sub- 
stituted addresses by trustees or by well-known men from a distance. 
He also established one commencement day for all the departments, 
thereby making the occasion a more imposing one. Since his adminis- 
tration began the university has come into possession of two new build- 
ings. It now has one building for each department. Caruthers Hall, 
the gift of Robert L. Caruthers, contains the rooms of the Law School.

Here, too, is found the library. The largest gift of books ever received 
was made in 1869, when Hon. Abraham Murdock, of Columbus, Miss., 
presented to the university the library of his father, Rey. James Mur- 
dock, of the theological department of Yale College. Chancellor Green 
instituted the custom of conferring degrees upon nonresident students 
who take the university courses of study by letter. The custom has 
since been abolished, except as regards post-graduate degrees. 
CHANGES IN THE THEOLOGICAL DEPARTMENT’. 
Great changes have taken place in the Theological School. In 1873 
asecond chair was established, the Murdock professorship of church 
history, in accordance with the conditions attaching to the gift of the 
Murdock Library. 
The department was entirely reorganized in 1877 by the creation of 
four professorships and two lectureships in the place of the former two 
professorships and by the lengthening of the course from one to two 
years. The endowment of this department, though small, is larger 
than that of the academic department. 
ENDOWMENT. 
The endowment of the university is approximately as follows:

Cumberland University is hampered by its want of endowment. It 
can never offer the best educational advantages until the want is sup- 
plied. More professors and more ample facilities are demanded.

This faculty has seen long service in the cause of the university. 
Not a member of it has served less than ten years, while some of them 
have been in the harness for a generation. 
EXAMINATIONS, ATTENDANCE, GRADUATES. 
There are no written examinations in any of the schools. Daily oral 
examinations are considered a better test of knowledge. The custom 
of holding written examinations was in vogue in the early history of 
the university, but it was soon abandoned. 
The attendance since the war has never reached the point that was 
reached before the war. In 1875~76 there were 372 students, but 162 
of them belonged to the business college, which was then located in 
Nashville and hardly deserved to be called a department of the univer- 
sity. For the last five years the matriculates in all departments have 
numbered 260, 290, 317, 312, and 275. 
Two thousand one hundred and thirty-seven graduates have received 
the diploma of the university. The degrees taken were as follows: 
Bachelor of arts, 394; bachelor of science, 56; master of arts, 18; doc- — 
tor of philosophy, 10; bachelor of laws, 1,425; bachelor of divinity, 204; 
civil engineer, 25. 
BUSINESS COLLEGE AND TELEGRAPH INSTITUTE, 
From 1873 to 1876 this school constituted a department of the univer- 
sity. Rev. Thomas Toney, A. M., M. D., was the principal and proprie- 
tor. Atthe close of 1874 Dr. Toney removed the schoolto Nashville and 
combined it with schools there of the same kind of which he was prin- 
cipal and proprietor. Its connection with the university soon ceased 
entirely.. The preparatory school has always included a business course 
which is less extensive than that offered by a business college. 
MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. 
During the years 1871, 18.2, and 1873 the medical college of Mem- 
phis had a nominal connection with Cumberland University. The con- 
nection afterwards ceased altogether. 
LAW SCHOOL. 
The idea of establishing a law school in Cumberland University is 
first found in this resolution of the board of trustees, passed February 
27, 1845: 
Resolved, That Hon. N. Green be appointed professor of international law and 
political economy in Cumberland University, and that he be notified of his appoint- 
ment and requested to accept the same. 
On account of “the afflictions of his family and other engagements me 
 
-P-A-G-E-244
  196 HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE. 
Judge Green did not accept. The position was then tendered to Judgé 
Abraham Caruthers, but with the same result. Here the project 
rested until January 9, 1847, when a committee composed of Jordan 
Stokes, William L. Martin, and Robert L. Caruthers was appointed to 
consider the advisability of creating a law department. The commit- 
tee reported in favor of a law department, the report was adopt d by 
the board of trustees, and Judge Abraham Caruthers was clected pro- 
fessor of law at a salary of $1,500. Judge Caruthers was receiving as 
circuit court judge a salary of $1,500—not very large, but sure of being 
paid. The success of a law school was very doubtful. Few of the 
lawyers of the day had been educated in law schools. If there were 
no well-defined opposition to them, there was at least no strong senti- 
ment in their favor. Besides, there was no endowment to insure the 
payment of the salary offered. But Robert L. Caruthers, brother of 
Judge Abraham Caruthers, obviated any difficulty on that score by 
becoming personally liable for any deficit in the salary that might arise 
from the insufficiency of tuition fees. Judge Caruthers then accepted. 
LAW SCHOOL SELF-SUPPORTING. 
The establishment of a law school conflicted with the long-cherished 
project of many Cumberland Presbyterians—the erection of a school of 
theology within the precincts of Cumberland University. They feared 
that the new enterprise would divert attention and divide energy and 
means that should be devoted entirely to founding a theological school. 
Their apprehensions were not quieted until the trustees, on July 26, 
1848, made public a contract between the trustees and the law professor 
“forever freeing the institution and the church from any liability or 
expense for the law school and guaranteeing all the income from said 
school for eight years to the law professor.” 
METHODS OF INSTRUCTION—COURSE OF STUDY. 
The school was opened in October, 1847, in the law office of Robert 
L. Caruthers. There were 7 students. The present chancellor of the 
university was one of the number. Before the end of the year the 7 
had become 13. Judge Caruthers adopted a system of instruction 
wholly different from the one in vogue. The prevailing system was the 
lecture system. Judge Caruthers acted upon the belief that it was 
folly to try to improve upon a good text-book. He accordingly assigned 
a lesson in the text, and the next day questioned each member of the 
class upon it. His endeavor was to make these examinations very 
searching, thereby bringing out the points of difficulty encountered by 
the student. The explanation of these points and a running commen- 
tary on the text took the place of formal lectures. 
It was urged against the lecture system that there was nothing in it 
to stimulate the student to exertion; but under this system fear of fail- 
ure in the presence of his classmates and a spirit of emulation would 
lead a student to do real, earnest work. 
   
-P-A-G-E-245
  
CUMBERLAND UNIVERSITY. 107 
This was,only one part of the scheme of instruction. The other part 
was the moot court. Here cases were tried and judgments rendered 
just as in actual court, the students impersonating the parties to the 
suit, the attorneys, and the various officers of the court. At every step 
of the proceedings the learner-had Judge Caruthers’s History of a Law 
Suit to guide him. What more than anything else made these moot 
courts of such great practical value was the presence on the bench of 
men who had just come from like positions in the real courts of the 
land. Judge Caruthers had worn the ermine for fourteen years, and 
Judge Green, who soon joined him, had sat on the supreme bench of 
Tennessee for twenty years. But itis useless to descant upon the merits 
of the moot court as a place where the principles of law can be practi- 
cally applied. Suffice it to say that the high position accorded it in 
the scheme of instruction had much to do with the efficiency and suc- 
cess of the Lebanon Law School. 
It has been the policy of the school to teach methods of procedure 
and such law as is needed in actual practice, rather than to delve into 
origins and to trace the history of legal principles. Special attention 
is given to live American law. 
Until 1853 the course of study covered two years, of ten months each. 
A student, however, could complete it in less time if his previous read- 
ing would justify him in doitg so. In 1853 the course was shortened 
to fifteen inonths. Since 1871 it has been only ten months, comprising 
a junior and a senior course of five months each. A man can graduate 
in five months, provided he can successfully pass an entrance examina- 
tion to the senior course. One reason for reducing the curriculum to 
ten months was that other schools had done the same. This was not 
long after the war. The country was still impoverished. Most young 
men could not afford to spend more than one year at a law school. 
Poverty forced them into the struggle for a livelihood. Inasmuch as a 
student would not, under any circumstances, remain longer than a year, 
it was thought best to present in that time as comprehensive, all-inelu- 
sive a view of the subject as possible. Other reasons were given for 
the change, but these were the only ones that had much force. The 
best law schools of the country are now increasing their courses to two, 
three, or even four years. Cumberland University, as well as other 
southern schools, will have to follow suit or else take lower rank. 
ENLARGEMENT OF LAW FACULTY. 
The second year of the school, 1848-49, there were 25 students in 
attendance; the third year there were 40. The enterprise was an 
assured success. The need of more teachers was felt. Accordingly, 
the services of Nathan Green, of the supreme court, and of Bromfield 
L. Ridley, one of the chancellors of the State, weresecured. They could 
give to the law school only their court vacations. This was found to be 
insufficient. Judge Green was therefore persuaded to retire from the  
-P-A-G-E-246
  198 HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE. 
bench and devote his whole time to the law school. This was in 1852. 
The services of Judge Ridley were then dispensed with. But ere long 
the need of a third professor was seriously felt, and in 1856 Nathan 
Green, jr., was added to the faculty. In 1859 John Cartwright Carter, 
another alumnus, became a professor in the school, but he remained 
only a year. 
LARGEST LAW SCHOOL IN THE UNITED STATES. 
In 1852, the fifth year of its existence, the Cumberland University 
law school had 86 students, and, in point of numbers, ranked second 
in the United States. It held this position uninterruptedly until 1858, 
when it took first rank among the law schools of the country. Its 
roll showed an attendance of 188. The Dane law school, at Harvard, 
came next with 146. The years preceding the civil war were glorious 
ones for the Lebanon law school. Its fame had spread far and wide, 
and its halls were crowded with the choicest youth of the South and 
Southwest. Many young men in those antebellum days studied law at 
Lebanon, not as a profession, but the better to fit themselves for citi- 
zenship. 
  HIGH PROFESSIONAL AND MORAL CHARACTER OF LAW FACULTY—SKETCHES OF 
PROFESSORS. . 
if it is asked what was the principal cause of the success of the 
Lebanon law school, we would reply, the character of its professors. 
They were men who for years had filled the highest judicial offices in 
the State, and who were known and respected throughout the South 
for their eminent legal ability and their high moral character. When 
such men left the bench for the professor’s chair it is not strange that 
young men flocked to hear them. Too great praise can not be given 
Abraham Caruthers and Nathan Green for forsaking the active pursuit 
of a profession in which they easily stood first for the less honored and 
less lucrative position of teachers of youth. This, the unselfish renun- 
siation of place and the consecration to a humble work, was the secret 
of the success of the Lebanon law school. 
Judge Caruthers had been on the circuit bench continuously for 
fourteen years. At the last election no opposition whatever had been 
offered to his reappointment. “It is said that fewer of his decisions 
were overruled than those of any judge who ever occupied a seat so 
Jong on the bench. Very many of his decisions have been incorporated 
into the opinions of the supreme court in affirmation of itsown.” About 
the time that the law school was started at Lebanon his History of a Law 
Suit appeared. It wasthena small 40-page book, but was afterwards 
enlarged to.a600-page volume. Ithas passed through several editions. 
Some one has called it “‘the clearest and most lucid exposition of law 
in practice that has ever been written.” Besides this well-known 
work, Judge Caruthers wrote a little book, American Law, as an intro-
-P-A-G-E-247
CUMBERLAND UNIVERSITY. 192: 
duction to the study of law. When the war broke out he was gather- 
ing the materials for a work of wider scope than any he had yet writ- 
ten. The characteristics of his style were clearness, vigor, terseness, 
and, to a remarkable degree, the power of condensation. 
Judge Green had been on the bench even longerthan Judge Caruthers 
After serving for a few years as chancellor when there were only two. 
in the State he was elected in 1831 to the supreme court. Here he re- 
mained by repeated reélection, until his resignation in 1852. He was 
aman of commanding presence, and his earnestness and dignity well 
befitted the majesty of the law. Like Judge Caruthers, he was noted 
for his uprightness and integrity. ‘ He was a teacher of righteousness, 
whose voice was heard, felt, and remembered throughout the State 
He was indeed the Sir Matthew Hale of Tennessee.” 
Hon. Bromfield L. Ridley, for several years a member of the law 
faculty, like his colleagues, had a long experience on the bench. He 
was twenty years a Tennessee chancellor. 
CIVIL WAR CLOSES LAW SCHOOL—REOPENED, 
It was not long after the civil war began before the law school dis- 
banded and its students were hurrying to the front, some to enlist 
under the banner of the Union, but the majority to enlist under the 
banner of the Confederacy. Nearly every alumnus of the schoo! took 
part in the conflict. Some rose to high position, others remained in 
theranks. Robert Hatton, Alexander W. Campbell, and John C. Carter 
became brigadier-generals in the Confederate army; William B. Bate 
rose to the rank of major-general. The first three were graduates of 
the law school. Gen. Bate had been a student, but did not graduate. 
Gen. Carter was killed at the battle of Franklin; Gen. Hatton was 
killed at the battle of Seven Pines. Judge Green and Judge Caruthers 
were strong Union men and opposers of secession, but when the issue 
was finally drawn they went with their section. Judge Green, who was 
growing old, staid quietly athome. Judge Caruthers was elected in 
1861 to the Tennessee legislature. When the country was overrun by 
the Federal troops he went to Marietta, Ga., to escape arrest. There he 
died among strangers, on the 5th day of May, 1862, in the sixtieth year 
of his age. 
At the close of the war the buildings were in ashes, two of the pro- 
fessors were dead, and there seemed little prospect of successfully reés- 
tablishing the law school. Judge Green, now in his seventy-third year 
and in very feeble health, was averse to any attempt to revive it. Ney- 
ertheless the attempt was made. Judge Green consented to lend the 
influence of his name, but the labor of instruction was expected to fall 
mainly on hisson. When the school opened in September of 1865, 20 stu- 
dents, all beginners in law, presented themselves. Every one of them 
had been a soldier in the late conflict. One was a Federal colonel, 
another was a Confederate general. By the end of the year their num-
-P-A-G-E-248

bers had increased to 43. Old Judge Green died in March, 1866. His 
pupils followed him to his grave with the affection of children. 
There were not wanting fears that this calamity would break up the 
Jaw school, but not so. The services of Judge Henry Cooper, of the 
circuit court, were secured, and the school went on. In 187273 there 
were 103 matriculates. Judge Cooper resigned in 1868 and removed to 
- Nashville. The next year he was elected to the upper house of the 
Tennessee legislature, and was soon after sent to the United States Sen- 
ate, beating Andrew Johnson by 4 votes. 
DEATH OF ROBERT L. CARUTHERS. 
Judge Robert L. Caruthers succeeded Judge Cooper as a professor 
in the Lebanon law faculty. He was himself sueceeded in 1880 by 
Andrew B. Martin. He died in 1882. Reference has already been 
made to him as the staunch friend and liberal benefactor of Cumberland 
University. That he stood high as a jurist and as a public man is evi- 
denced by the positions he filled. ‘ He held many positions of trust, 
having been attorney-general in one of the judicial districts, member of 
the legislature of Tennessee, member of the Congress of the United 
States, member of the Confederate congress, Confederate governor-elect 
of the State of Tennessee, and for more than ten years one of the judges 
of the supreme court.” 
PRESENT FACULTY. 
Andrew B. Martin and Nathan Green, jr., compose the present law 
faculty. Prof. Martin, who succeeded Robert L. Caruthers both as law 
professor and as president of the board of trustees, after graduating 
in the Lebanon law school, practiced his profession for many years. 
At one time he was a member of the legislature and served as chair- 
man of the judiciary committee. Prof.Green has grown gray in the 
service of Cumberland University. He has been a professor of law for 
thirty-four years and chancellor for seventeen years. 
Over 2,000 young men have attended the Lebanon law school, and 
between 1,400 and 1,500 have completed the course. The average 
attendance for the last five years has been about 60. 
PROMINENT GRADUATES OF LEBANON LAW SCHOOL.

CHAPTER VI. 
THE UNIVERSITY OF THE SOUTH. 
By Prof. Witu1am P. TRENT, M. A. 
IDEALS OF THE FOUNDERS. 
The germ of the University of the South is to be found in a plan 
formed by James Hervey Otey, first bishop of Tennessee, of establish- 
ing in his missionary field, which practically covered the present South- 
western States, “a large institution,” under the control of the Episco- 
pal Church, “in which religion should go hand in hand with every les- 
son of a secular character, and young men be prepared for the minis- 
try.”! While awaiting the realization of this ambitious plan, Bishop 
Otey founded at Columbia, Tenn., his home, a school for girls, which is 
still in existence and still known as “The Columbia Institute.” He 
was assisted in this work by the Rev. Leonidas Polk, then rector of St. 
Peter’s Church, Columbia. When Dr, Polk was consecrated missionary 
bishop of Arkansas, ete. (1838), and when, later, he became bishop of 
Louisiana (1841), he was ina position to do much toward the realization 
of Bishop Otey’s idea of a great church university. Being a younger 
and, by reason of his military training, a more dashing man, Bishop 
Polk was the first to take a decisive step toward establishing this ideal 
university; and, being more of a partisan than Bishop Otey, he was 
impelled to extend the scope of the latter’s scheme. Instead of a uni- 
versity of the Southwest, a university of the South, under the control 
of the church, seemed the fitting thing to a warrior bishop who was to 
lay down his life a few years later in defense of that South. 
The decisive step taken by Bishop Polk was the issuing of a pam- 
phlet, dated July 1, 1856, and addressed to the bishops of Tennessee, 
North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, 
Arkansas, and Texas. In this pamphlet, after dwelling upon the need 
of the South for institutions of learning which should compare favorably 
with those of the highest grade at the North, and after pointing out the 
obligation resting, as he conceived, upon Southern churchmen to pro- 
vide for the education of their children under religious auspices, Bishop 
Polk suggested a combined movement among his Episcopal brethren 
to establish a university, under joint diocesan control, to be situated in

some central position, such as the extremity of the Alleghany range in 
Tennessee. He further suggested that the meeting of the General Con- 
vention to be held in Philadelphia during the ensuing autumn would 
be a fitting opportunity for the bishops to hold a personal conference 
on the subject. 
Bishop Polk’s pamphlet was well received by the bishops to whom it 
was addressed. It not only chimed in with their own ideas as to the 
desirability of establishing a university of high grade, which should 
also be a church institution,! but it was in harmony with the general 
movement toward Southern independence, which was manifesting itself 
in Southern commercial conventions as well as in the violent party 
strifes which soon precipitated the war of secession. The Southern 
bishops accordingly met in council during the session of the General 
Convention in October, 1856, and resolved to issue an address to the 
friends of the church in their respective dioceses. This address was 
signed by nine bishops on October 23, 1856, and was immediately pub- 
lished at Philadelphia in pamphlet form. Its keynote naturally coin- 
cided with that struck by Bishop Polk’s letter; but certain definite 
steps toward organization were detailed, many of which were after- 
wards incorporated in the constitution of the university subsequently 
established in consequence of this episcopal appeal. 
The address was received with enthusiasm. Offers of land and money 
came from communities anxious to secure the site of the proposed insti- 
tution, and in accordance with a suggestion of the bishops each diocese 
elected one clerical and two lay trustees to serve in conjunction with 
the nine diocesans. The board thus constituted met at Lookout Moun- 
tain, Tennessee, on the 4th of July, 1857. After appropriate patriotic 
and religious ceremonies, in which several hundred visitors took part, 
the trustees proceeded to the work of organization. 
ANTE BELLUM ORGANIZATION. 
Twenty trustees from seven dioceses constituted the board which met. 
at Lookout Mountain under the presidency of Bishop Otey. The main 
business transacted, besides the appointment of important committees 
on the subjects of site, charter, ete., was the adoption of a“ declaration 
of principles” similar in most respects to the principles laid down by 
the bishops in their first address. The gist of this “declaration” was 
that the university (which as yet had no name, although the name it 
now bears had been already advocated) should be “ under the soleand 
perpetual direction of the Protestant Episcopal Church, represented 
through a board of trustees” (to be elected as above described); that 
it should not be “‘put into operation until the sum of at least $500,000” 
had been “actually secured ;” and, finally, that its location should be 
“as central to all the contracting dioceses” as possible.

An adjourned meeting of the trustees was held at Montgomery, Ala., 
November 25, 1857. At this meeting a charter was drafted and adopted, 
the bishops of Louisiana and Georgia were appointed to secure sub- 
scriptions for the work, and the questions of name and site were discussed 
and practically settled. For the honor and advantages of securing the 
site of the university many places competed, to wit: Huntsville, Ala.; 
Atlanta, Ga.; McMinnville, Chattanooga, Cleveland, Tenn., and Se- 
wanee, then a wilderness of forest and cliff. So much interest was 
excited over the question of location that a two-thirds’ rule, was adopted, 
and seventeen ballots were taken before Sewanee received a sufficient 
number of votes. Less interest was manifested in the choice of a name 
for the university, but still the name it now bears was not chosen with- 
out some discussion and criticism. 
The trustees met next at Beersheba Springs, Tenn., on July 4, 1858, 
The charter granted by the State of Tennessee, January 6, 1858, was 
accepted, and a committee was appointed to prepare a constitution. 
Another committee was charged with the task of selecting an agent, 
who should visit the great universities of Europe and America and 
make such reports as would assist the trustees “in rightly commencing 
and successfully conducting” their proposed university. At this meet- 
ing an attempt was made, chiefly by the Alabama trustees, to defeat 
the choice of Sewanee as the site of the university; but matters had 
gone too far and the attempt miscarried. It was, possibly, to reassure 
the public mind that the trustees shortly after issued a pamphlet to 
the Southern dioceses justifying their choice of what most people seemed 
to regat dasarugged mountain peak. They admitted thatif they could 
have pitched upon a large city of undoubted healthfulness, they would 
have preferred it to the virgin plateau of the Cumberland, but they 
assured their critics that Sewanee could be reached by railroad, and 
that there was no necessity for students and visitors to be practiced 
Alpine climbers. They also informed the public that students would 
“have about as much to dread from milk sickness ”—that mysterious 
disease—“as from the Indians who once roamed over these hills and 
swarmed in these valleys.” 
On August 10, 1859, the trustees again met at Saactiohs: The gen- 
eral commissioners, ita Polk and Elliott, made a most encouraging 
report. They had some months previously (Febroary 24) published an 
address in which they set forth the advantages to be expected from 
the establishment of the university, and gave assurance that the money 
they might raise would not be squandered upon the realization of a 
temporary or insignificant scheme, In response to this appeal they 
received by August $363,580 “in cash, bonds, and notes, payable in 
available periods,” together with $115,000 in pledges uncovered as yet 
by notes. Most of this amount had come from one diocese, Louisiana, 
and the commissioners felt assured that the three millions they had 
set their hearts on would be obtained without great difficulty. The

treasurer reported, furthermore, that he had in hand a bond of Col. 
Isaac Crown, of Alabama, for $25,000, given for the endowment of a 
professorship of agriculture. The committee on survey and selection 
likewise made a report declaring that they had surveyed certain tracts 
of land already deeded to the university, amounting to 9,525 acres. It 
was with feelings of general satisfaction, therefore, that the trustees 
adjourned to meet at New Orleans in February of the following year. 
The principal business of this meeting was to discuss the proposed 
constitution and statutes of the university. The committee having 
these in charge had made a thorough examination of the working sys- 
tems of the great American and European universities, and their 
report met with general commendation. The final adoption of the con- 
stitution and statutes was, however, reserved for the next meeting of 
the trustees, which was held at Sewanee on October 9 of the same 
year (1860). At this meeting, after certain amendments, the constitu- 
tion and statutes were adopted in the shape in which they practically 
stand to-day. 
There is little in these documents that calls for special notice here. 
The senior bishop by consecration was to be chancellor of the univer- 
sity; but the real executive head was the vice-chancellor, who was to 
be assisted in his work by the hebdomadal board, which was to consist 
of twelve professors and no more. The elective system of the Univer- 
sity of Virginia was practically adopted, and great power and freedom 
were reposed in the heads of schools. Professors’ salaries were to 
range from $3,000 to $5,000, and each professor was to be furnished 
with a house. This liberality was paralleled by the magnificent scope 
given to the academic and professional departments of the university. 
Thirty-two separate schools were to be established as speedily as pos- 
sible, to wit: (1) Greek, (2) Latin, (3) mathematics, (4) physics, (5) 
metaphysics, (6) history and archeology, (7) natural science, “with 
cabinets and gardens of plants attached,” (8) geology, mineralogy, and 
paleontology, (9) civil engineering, (10) theoretical and experimental 
chemistry, (11) chemistry “applied to agriculture and the arts,” (12) 
theory and practice of agriculture, “with farm attached,” (13) moral 
science and evidences of Christian religion, (14) English, (15) French, 
(16) German, (17) Spanish, (18) Italian, (19) “school of oriental lan- 
guage and literature,” (20) “school of the philosophy of language,” 
(21) “school of the philosophy of education,” (22) “school of rhetoric, 
criticism, clocution, and composition,” (23) ‘school of American his- 
tory and antiquities,” (24) “school of ethnology and universal geog- 
raphy,” (25) “school of astronomy (with observatory) and physical 
geography,” (26) “‘school of political science, political economy, statis- 
tics, law of nations, spirit of laws, general principles of government, 
and Constitution of the United States,” (27) “school of commerce and. 
trade, including the history and laws of banking, exchange, insurance, 
brokerage, and bookkeeping,” (28) theology, (29) law, (30) medicine, 
(31) mines and mining, (32) fine arts, including sacred music.

  206 HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE. 
It is no wonder that the men who could plan such an institution felt 
swept away by enthusiasm when, on October 10, 1860, “8 bishops, 200 
presbyters, and 5,000 people assembled on top of the Cumberland 
Mountains” to witness the laying of the corner stone of the University 
of the South. What wonder that when Col. John 8S, Preston, of South 
Carolina, the orator of the day, turned to Bishop Polk and exclaimed: 
“When it pleaseth God, your Master, to stay your radiant and strong 
right arm from His battlefields on earth and call you to share His 
everlasting triumph, the heavens and your grateful country will read 
on your gravestone, ‘The founder of the University of the South,’” his 
auditors were conyulsed with tears; what wonder that they saw nothing 
exaggerated on rhetorical about the compliment; that they forgot that 
there was little likelihood that in the approaching strife of the sections 
they would be allowed to build in peace upon the corner stone Bishop 
Polk had laid. And yet some thoughtful men of that assembly must 
have felt as it dispersed that the year 1860 was a bad one for the in- 
ception of a peaceful enterprise. It is doubtful, however, whether 
anyone dreamed that in less than three years hostile squadrons would 
be marching over the very spot where robed prelates and vested choris- 
ters had assisted in consecrating a stone which was destined to be 
hacked to pieces by wanton or thoughtless foes. 
POST-BELLUM ORGANIZATION, 
Only one meeting of the trustees took place during the war, and that 
was at Columbia, 8. C., on October 14, 1861. Although the great 
struggle was in full career, and although one of the two commissioners 
of endowment, Bishop Polk, was serving in the Confederate army, and 
the other, Bishop Elliott, was about to resign his position because he 
found it impossible to make collections, the board did not waver for an 
instant in its high purposes, but went on calmly adopting rules of order 
for its own government and devising plans for laying off the university 
domain. But as the conflict deepened rules of order and plans had to 
be laid aside, and youths who had looked forward to becoming the first 
matriculants of the University of the South were ere long sleeping on 
some glorious or disastrous battlefield. But although the rude begin- 
nings of the university at Sewanee were destroyed by the enemy, 
although the founder and many of the original projectors of the enter- 
prise were swept away, still the idea of the University of the South 
was not for a moment lost sight of. 
In March, 1866, the Rt. Rev. Charles Todd Quintard, bishop of Ten- 
nessee, went to the then deserted Sewanee and “planted a cross upon 
the site of the chapet of the mission.”! In May of the same year a build- 
ing was put up for a “ Training and Theological School.” This building, 
a rude affair, was called Otey Hall and the funds used to erect it were 
the proceeds of collections made by Bishop Quintard. A few months

later Bishop Quintard and a zealous lay trustee, Mr. George R. Fair- 
banks, of Florida, erected residences and brought their families to 
Sewanee. In October the chancellor, Bishop Elliott'. called a meeting 
of the trustees at Sewanee (or University Place, as it was then called) 
and there it was determined unanimously that the work of establishing 
the university should be carried on. 
In February, 1867, Bishop Green, of Mississippi, then chancellor 
through the death of Biskop Elliott, called a meeting of the board at 
Montgomery, Ala., and it was resolved to begin the good work by 
developing the small school already planned into a “high school of the 
best description.” Bishop Quintard and Maj. Fairbanks were appointed 
commissioners and succeeded in raising a small amount of money which 
was judiciously expended on the necessary buildings. At this meeting — 
Bishop Quintard was elected vice-chancellor of the university. - 
In August, 1867, the trustees met at University Place and resolved 
tomake an appeal to the generosity of English churchmen, through 
the instrumentality of the approaching Lambeth conference. Bishop 
Quintard, who attended the conference, was indefatigable in his labors 
and succeeded in arousing great interest in his mission. The two arch- 
bishops.and many bishops and clergymen gave aid both by their prayers 
and contributions, and a sufficient fund was raised to enable the trus- 
tees formally to open a “junior department of the university,” 7. e., a 
grammar school, on September 18, 1868. Among the promoters of the 
university in England was the Rev. F.W. Tremlett, rector of St. Peter’s 
Church, Belsize Park, London. In consideration of his services he 
was given the first honorary degree (D.C. L.) conferred by the univer- 
sity, and one of the first buildings received his name. 
Meanwhile unimportant meetings of the board had been held and an 
unsuccessful attempt made to secure the services of the eminent scien- 
tist, Commodore M. F. Maury, as vice-chancellor? This failing, Bishop 
Quintard was induced to retain the offiee. A head master for the new 
grammar school was secured in the person of Gen. Josiah Gorgas, late 
head of the ordnance department of the Confederacy. Gen. Gorgas 
was nominally head of the junior department, but it is easy to see from 
the vague way in which the duties of his situation are deseribed in the 
records that he was practically put in charge of a preparatory school, 
which opened with 9 students and 4 teachers or “professors.” By the 
the summer of 1869 these 9 students had increased to 90, and the trus- 
tees determined to organize a distinct grammar school as soon as pos- 
sible. Buildings, however, were a necessity, for the newly built and 
by no means large chapel had to be used as a study and recitation hall. 
Nor were there sufficient boarding halls to accommodate the incoming 
students. But how could the trustees meet all the demands upon them   
1 Bishops Otey and Polk were both dead. 
2It is said that efforts were made to secure the services of Gen. Robert E. Lee, 
but no official action seems to have been taken,

when the report of the finance committee showed that during the pre- 
vious year (August, 1868, to August, 1869) not quite $15,000 had been 
collected. They might, however, have profited by the reflection that 
over two-thirds of this amount had been raised by one enthusiastic 
man, Bishop Quintard, and they had little reason to waste their time 
in heartily approving “of the offer of a gentleman of Louisiana to 
establish a prize medal for gentlemanly deportment.” 
It can be seen from the report which the vice-chancellor addressed to 
the trustees at their meeting in July, 1870, that the university had al- 
ready developed many of the features that characterize it to-day. The 
winter vacation had been adopted, giving a practically continuous ses- 
sion from March to December, although the scholastic year was divided 
into two terms, Trinity and Lent, beginning in August and March, 
respectively. The system of distributing students by tens and scores 
in private boarding halls was also coming into vogue. The military 
drill (abolished in 1891) was also a feature of early Sewance life, and 
the easy, dignified manners of the students, with which visitors are now 
so much impressed, formed a special topic of hopeful prognostication 
in Bishop Quintard’s report, referred to above. The faculty then, as 
now, was overworked, but enthusiastic and confident of ultimate suc- 
cess. It consisted, besides the vice-chancellor, of Gen. Josiah Gorgas, 
professor of civil engineering; Rey. F. A. Shoup, professcr of mathe- 
matics; Robert Dabney, M. A., professor of metaphysics; Rev. F. A. 
Juny, 8. T. D., professor of modern languages; John B. Elliott, M. D., 
professor of chemistry, and Caskie Harrison, professor of ancient lan- 
guages. Of these gentlemen Prof. Shoup is the only one still connected 
with the university and his services have not been continuous. 
In 1871 the vice-chancellor was able to report that the number of stu- 
dents in grammar school and university together amounted to nearly 
200. The school was now more completely separated from the univer- 
sity proper, and a new chair, that of moral science, was instituted in 
the latter. To this the Rev. William P. DuBose, M. A., was elected, 
and the duties of chaplain were likewise intrusted to him. The use of 
the scholastic cap and gown by officers and students was determined 
upon by the trustees at this session; and, as there were 114 students to 
wear them and as the grammar school, with 125 pupils, seemed to as- 
sure a plentiful supply of students for the future, it looked as if the 
dark days of the university were beginning to pass away. But such 
was not the case. 
The year 187273, it is true, saw a loss of only three students. The loss 
of two professors, Dr. Juny and Mr. C. L. C. Minor, but recently elected. 
to the chair of Latin, was somewhat compensated by the election of a 
resident vice-chancellor in the person of Gen. Gorgas, Bishop Quin- 
tard’s episcopal duties leavi ing him no time for extra work. The next

THE UNIVERSITY OF THE SOUTH 209 
year saw a fair increase of students and the first degrees, not honor- 
ary, that the university had conferred. Only four of these degrees 
were given, the faculty and trustees having determined to hold up the 
high standard in this matter for which the University of Virginia had 
long been celebrated. This policy has since been rigorously pursued, 
and wherever the university is known the value of its degrees is recog- 
nized. Thelack of interest among ex-students whichinvariably attends 
institutions which do not graduate fairly numerous classes has been 
compensated in the case of Sewanee by the intense love which the 
unique character of the place inspires in all who come within reach of 
its influence. It may be remarked that in 1873 a system of degrees 
was established by the board which, with a few changes, has lasted 
till the present day, and it is interesting to observe that the recent 
modifications in the master’s degree of the University of Virginia are 
strikingly in unison with the views held with regard to that degree by 
the Sewanee trustees of eighteen years before. 
During the next few years there are no great changes to be noted, 
but the number of students was obviously falling off. Two new profes- 
sors, Col. F. Schaller and Gen. E. Kirby Smith, the latter being one of 
the best known and mosthighly esteemed of the Confederate commanders, 
were appointed to the chairs of modern languages and mathematics va- 
cated by Dr. Junyand Gen.Shoup. The theological departmentreceived 
amore definite constitution through the election of Rev. George T. Wil- 
mer to the chair of systematic divinity and through the generous gift 
of Mrs. Charlotte Morris Manigault, of South Carolina, of $25,000 for the 
erection of a theological hall. Another permanent building which was 
going up was a library, the gift of Rev. Telfair Hodgson, but as yet the 
books to put in it were few and far between. But Bishop Quintard was 
still laboring indefatigably, and hehad just (1876) preached in England 
155 sermons and made numerous addresses, all on behalf of the univer- 
sity. Asa result of his labors he was enabled to report to the trustees 
that he had collected, including the donation of Mrs. Manigault, nearly 
$40,000. 
But in 1878, despite these gifts, the university was in serious embar- 
rassments. The professors depended for their salaries on-fees from 
students, and there was a still greater falling off in numbers, and many 
who were enrolled did not pay for their tuition. Retrenchment was 
absolutely necessary, and so the professors of the theological depart- 
ment were thrown for their support upon the contributions of the 
various dioceses, a sorry maintenance, and the incumbent of one 
chair (modern languages) was not reélected at the end of his five years’ 
term. The vice-chancellorship, too, made vacant by the acceptance by 
Gen. Gorgas of the presidency of the University of Alabama, was left 
in abeyance, and the able professor of chemistry, Dr. John B. Elliott, 
was made chairman of the faculty. An endeavor was made at this 
juncture to induce Kentucky to unite with her sister dioceses in the

control and support of the university; but the effort was not suc- 
cessful until seven years later. 
An interesting memorial of this time ‘that tried men’s souls in Se- 
wanee is a privately printed ‘“ Report of the hebdomadal board to the 
board of trustees, August, 1879.” The document is rather an address 
fall of the love and faith that had characterized the faculty in the 
past, but full also of misgivings as to the future. The history of their 
struggles is plainly written in the following abridged list of ‘4 obsta- 
cles” to the university’s success: 
(1) Want of endowment, involving want of adequate instruction in several 
branches, chiefly scientific; want of apparatus, laboratories, collections, and of a 
library. 
(2) A very high tuition fee. 
(3) Inability of trustees to meet more than once a year, or for more than a week 
then. 
(4) Absence of a Gedniancan executive body resident at Sewanee throughout the 
year. 
(5) Isolated location of the university. 
(6) Impression that Sewanee is only a diocesan school belonging to the diocese of 
Tennessee. 
(7) Undeserved reputation for ritualism. 
(8) Rival theological seminaries in Southern dioceses. 
(9) Intimate association of grammar school and university, leading to the impres- 
sion that the whole is only a sort of high school. 
(10) Want of series of publications to keep the university before the public. 
Reading this list of obstacles as a member of the hebdomadal board 
in 1891, I can not but reflect upon its applicability to the university’s 
present condition, yet 1 can not at the same time shut my eyes to the 
fact that in twelve years Sewanee has made vast strides in develop- 
ment, and that no obstacles can long hold out against the faith and zeal 
that her faculty, and students, and alumni, and trustees have ever 
shown. And I can say this with some grace from the fact that when I 
came to Sewanee the crisis had passed, and that my own labors have 
been for the most part with the tide, not against it. 
The changes wrought in these twelve years and the reasons for them 
can only be touched upon briefly, for this chapter must be brought to 
a close. In 1879 Rev. Telfair Hodgson became vice-chancellor, after 
having held the office of dean of the theological department for one 
year. Dr. Hodgson asked for no salary and made his private means 
support the falling credit of the university in financial circles. He 
threw himself into his work with great energy, and the results of 
his geverosity and devotion to Sewanee were soon apparent. The 
number of students increased. Permanent buildings began to be 
erected both by the university and by private individuals, and business 
methods were introduced for a time in offices where they had long been 
wanted. Officers began to understand that, even though a man be per- 
fectly honest, it is still well for him to keep his books straight. Some peo- 
plecried out that red tape was making its appearance at Sewanee, that

the free and easy life of the place was departing; bué the far-sighted 
realized that Sewanee had passed one critical stage of her existence, and 
that her future was beginning to be assured. When a full history of 
the University of the South is written, the chapter devoted to Dr. 
Hodgson’s eleven years of authority will be one of primary interest and 
importance. 
Meanwhile some changes had taken place in the faculty. In 1877 
Mr. John McCrady, formerly of Harvard, a friend and pupil of Agassiz, 
took the chair of biology, and did active and far-reaching work in the 
university until his” death, in 1882. In 1879 Rey. A. Jaeger became 
professor of Old Testament language and interpretation, and the theo- 
logical faculty was thus increased to four members. In 1880 a com- 
mandant for the cadet corps was obtained from the United States Gov- 
ernment, and the detail was continued until 1891. For some years 
this military system was an efficient factor in the university’s develop- 
ment, but the institution soon outgrew it. In 1882 three young men 
were elected to full professorships, and their work must be counted as 
perhaps the greatest factor in the university’s subsequent progress. 
These were Rev. Thomas I. Gailor, M. A., 8. T. B.; B. L. Wiggins, M. A., 
and IF, M. Page. Mr. Gailor was soon made chaplain,’ and immedi- 
ately gained a wonderful and unique hold upon the student body; he 
also served as professor of ecclesiastical history and acting professor 
of English. In 1890 he succeeded Dr, Hodgson as vice-chancellor. In 
1891 he received the degree of 8. T. D. from Columbia College, New 
York, and retused the bishopric of Georgia, that he might give himself 
to the work at Sewanee. He stands to-day the foremost figure in the 
Southern church, and the sacrifices he has made for Sewanee will bear 
fruit, not only in the love and admiration of his students, but also in 
the continued prosperity of the institution he loves so well. 
Prof. Wiggins, when he took the chair of ancient languages just 
vacated by Prof. Caskie Harrison,? was perhaps the youngest professor 
in the United States. His chair had long been the most important in 
the university; a natural result of church control and of the avowed 
following of English traditions. Under Prof. Wiggins the chair has 
lost none of its prestige, although the growth of the university has 
brought other chairs into prominence. It is safe to say that there are 
few better teachers of the classics anywhere than Prof. Wiggins, and 
it is equally safe to say that no institution in the South turns out more 
well-equipped classical scholars than Sewanee. To some persons this 
may not seem high praise; but those quiet but thoughtful men, who 
believe in the study of the classics when it can be prosecuted without 
1Succeeding Dr. Du Bose, whose services were required in connection with the 
two important chairs, New Testament exegesis and moral science, in which he has 
done abiding work. 
2 Among the early professors none deserves more credit than Mr, Harrison for his 
maintenance of a high and scholarly standard of work.

excluding other studies of importance, will rejoice at the stand Sewanee 
has taken and means to keep on this vexed question. Prof. Page has 
just severed his connection with Sewanee after ten years of faithful 
labor in the chair of modern languages. Throughout his career he main- 
tained the dignity of his chair in the face of serious difficulties growing 
out of the fact that the South is only beginning to wake up to the 
necessity for a wider range of studies than that with which our fathers 
were satisfied. Benjamin W. Wells, PH. D., a well-known scholar in his 
special department and one of the most profound students of ecclesi- 
astical history in America, has just succeeded Prof. Page. 
In 1883 Rev. F. A. Shoup, D. D., returned to Sewanee after an absence 
of eight years, and was elected to the chair of metaphysics. Prof. Shoup 
is a sound scholar as well as one of the most versatile of men. His 
chair is justly regarded as one of the most important in the university, 
and his colleagues trust that he will never again leave them. In 1885. 
Dr. John B. Elliott, professor of chemistry, resigned to accept a chair 
in Tulane University. Prof. Elliott’s action, although recognized as 
necessary, was greatly deplored. No man, save Dr. Gailor, has left so 
strong an impress upon Sewanee, and after six years one still hears the 
laudator temporis acti lamenting Dr. Elliott’s departure. There are also 
periodic rumors that he is coming back to fill his old chairs—rumors 
that remind us of the stories told by the peasants of Germany about 
Kaiser Barbarossa. Dr. Elliott was succeeded for a short while by Dr. 
J.W.S. Arnold, and in 1887 by Dr. Cameron Piggot, the present effi- 
cient incumbent cf the chair of chemistry. Few men could have suc- 
ceeded as Prof. Piggot has with so poorly equipped a laboratory at 
his disposal. Other changes in the faculty that may be noticed are the 
appointment of Mr. Greenough White, as professor of English, in 1887, 
after two years’ connection with the university as a tutor; of Dr. A. A. 
Benton, in 1888, as professor of dogmatic theology; of Rev. M. M. Ben- 
ton, in 1891, as professor of physics. In 1888 the present writer suc- 
ceeded Mr, White as professor of English and history.! 
CONCLUSION. 
The University of the South stands to-day in a better financial posi- 
tion than it has ever done. Five permanent buildings have been erected, 
two of which—Convocation Hall and the Walsh Memorial Building 
(intended for lecture halls)—will compare favorably with the permanent 
buildings of almost any university in the country. Efforts are being 
steadily made to secure endowments for the chairs. There are eleven 
full professors, who are working with the earnestness that has always 
characterized those upon whom Sewanee has laid her spell. The num- 
ber of students is growing, and the zeal of the alumni increases in an 
even ratio with their ability to help their alma mater. In the church,

Gregg, D. D., became chancellor of the university.

at the bar, in all the walks of life, these alumni are marked men through- 
out the South, and not a few have spread the reputation of Sewanee in 
other sections and even in other lands. Ten years ago the body of 
alumni were poor struggling men. Now they are rapidly amassing 
wealth, and they will not forget Sewanee. The board of trustees, too, 
which has never lacked zeal for the institution in its charge, is wid- 
ening its views with regard to the university and is working in great 
harmony with the faculty. A spirit of change, of progress, is in the 
air. The abolition of the military system of discipline, the contem- 
plated removal or abolition of the grammar school, the efforts that are 
being made to establish a law school, the increase of private research 
and of published work by individual professors,! are all signs of 
Sewanee’s growth and of the permanence of the work that is being , 
done. Dr. Charles Dudley Warner is not the first stranger who has 
been impressed with the thorough-going nature and elevated and unique 
character of that work, and he is not the first friend who has uttered 
the inspiring prayer: “God bless the University of the South.”? 
[Since the above was written both a medical and a law department 
have been added, as well as an advanced course in finance and 
economy. The appearance of The Sewanee Review has given the pro- 
fessors an organ and the South a critical journal of high aims. The 
death of Gen. Kirby Smith and the elevation of Dr. Gailor to the epis- 
copate should also be noted.

CHAPTER VIL 
SOUTHWESTERN PRESBYTERIAN UNIVERSITY. 
THE MASONIC UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE AND STEWART COLLEGE. 
The Masonic University of Tennessee was founded -in 1850 by the 
Masons of the State, but it was soon transferred to the Masons of Mont- 
gomery County. Its presidents were W. FI. Hopkins, T. M. Newell, 
W. A. Forbes, and William M. Stewart, successively, until the year 
1855, when it came into the possession of the Presbyterian Synod of 
Nashville. The name was then changed to Stewart College in honor 
of Prof. William M. Stewart, who was president of the school at the 
time of its purchase from the Masons, and who continued as such under 
the new management. Southwestern Presbyterian’ University owes 
much to Prof. Stewart. A scientist of no mean ability, he has left his 
imprint on the institution with which he was connected. His cabinet, 
consisting of 30,000 mineralogical and geological specimens, he pre- 
sented to the college, as also his large scientific library, containing 
many rare volumes. In 1858 the Rev. R. B. McMullen, D. D., succeeded. 
to the presidency of the college. Prof. Stewart, however, continuing in 
his capacity of professor of the natural sciences. Stewart College suf- 
fered severely during the war. Its library, cabinets, and apparatus 
were swept away and for several years its doors were closed. But the 
college soon revived from the misfortunes of war. During the years 
1868 to 1870 the buildings were repaired and refurnished. . The endow- 
ment, consisting hitherto chiefly of lands and buildings, was gradually 
increased until it exceeded $100,000. A large part of this was given 
by the city of Clarksville. In 1870 Rev. J. B. Shearer, D. D., was | 
élected president by the trustees. The faculty at this time was as fol- 
lows: J. B. Shearer, D. D., metaphysics, logic, political economy, etc.; 
William M. Stewart, A. M., geology and mineralogy; James Dinwiddie, 
A. M., mathematics, etc.; D. M. Quarles, Latin, ete.; W. W. Legare, 
A. B., Greek, natural philosophy, and astronomy, and 8. J. Coffman, 
modern languages. The disasters of the war had been repaired and 
the reopening of the school had been attended with unexpected success. 
It was about this time that the movement bogan which was to result 
in the merging of Stewart College in an institution of broader scope 
and wider influence, namely, the

SOUTHWESTERN PRESBYTERIAN UNIVERSITY. 
Stewart College was a school belonging to only a small portion of 
the Southern Presbyterian Chureh—the Synod of Nashville. Theestab- 
lishment of one great university for the South had long been a cher- 
ished project with many. This plan took definite form at the meeting 
of the general assembly of the Southern Presbyterian Church in 
Louisville in 1870, when the Rev. Dr. John A. Lyon proposed that a 
convention of educators should meet at the time of the next general 
assembly at Huntsville in 1871. The resolution was passed and the 
convention met. But the hopes of those who desired a school for the 
whole South were disappointed, for it was decided that the proposition 
was not a practicable one. Still, if the hearty coéperation of only a 
part of the church could be secured it was possible to establish a 
school of considerable size. This was the line of action finally deter- 
mined upon. At a meeting in May, 1873, of commissioners from the 
synods of Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, Nashville, and Memphis 
the following plan of union was drawn up: 
Resolved, 1, That the proposed union of synods for the furtherance of our educa- 
tion interests is in every way desirable, and that it is practicable to unite in the 
founding, endowment, support, and government of an institution common to them 
all. 
Resolved, 2. The object and scope of the institution shall be not only to train our 
youth to enter upon one of the learned professions, but also to fit them for the ordi- 
nary vocations of life. Tothis end it shall be a university in two senses: First, it 
shall offer the largest facilities for thorough culture and for a high standard of 
graduation; and second, the organization shall be made on the plan of separate and 
coérdinate schools and elective courses. In connection with every course there shall 
be a faithful and comprehensive Biblical training, so as to make an intelligent Scrip- 
tural faith a controlling principle in the institution. 
Resolved, 3. In realizing the proposed object and scope of the institution, the order 
of development shall be: First, the various liberal studies usually embraced in a 
college curriculum, and then the scientific and polytechnic schools necessary. 
Resolved, 4. The sole government of the institution shall be in the hands of the 
directory, consisting of two members of each synod, one elected each year after tho 
first, of whom one-half shall constitute a quorum, With a view to securing the nec- 
essary confidential relations between the directory and the faculty, the presiding 
officer of the institution shall be ex officio the presiding officer of the board of di- 
rectors. 
Resolved, 5. The directory shall, with other duties, have power to elect all members 
of the faculty or remove for cause, and shall have in chargo the raising, preserva- 
tion, and administration of all moneys, either directly or by such executive agency 
as may seem to them the best, and shall be incorporated in the State in which the 
school may bo located. 
Resolved, 6. The board shall proceed at once to secure subscriptions to the amount 
of $500,000, payable one-fifth down when subscribed and the remainder in four 
annual installments, and shall locate, organize, and develop the institution as soon 
as, in their judgment, it can be done with safety, and to such extent as the means 
in hand will justify without incurring debt. 
This plan was referred for approval to the five synods sending com- 
missioners and to the Synod of Texas. 
The adoption was singularly unanimous in all the synods, a fact of no small

moment when we consider the distracting views which had for-years divided our 
best men on the relations of the church and _ the school, and in view of the avowed 
purpose to make a school more distinctly Christian than heretofore. All parties 
are satisfied and all views harmonized by this plan and outline and distracting 
questions are at rest. 
This plan of union, then, was the basis upon which rested all subse- 
quent efforts to establish the university. Each synod appointed two 
directors and to this board of directors was entrusted the whole under- 
taking. Dr. J. B. Shearer, president of Stewart College, was a direc- 
tor and one of the most enthusiastic and active promoters of the enter- 
prise. He was temporarily relieved of his duties as head of Stewart 
College, in order that he might devote his energies to securing an en- 
dowment for the proposed university. At a meeting of the board of 
directors in Memphis, May 14, 1874, Clarksville was selected as the site 
of the new school and “ Stewart College with its funds and appurte- 
nances as the nucleus of future operations.” Under the then existing 
method of granting charters by special act of the legislature it was diffi- 
cult to secure such a charter as the board desired. But in1875 a general 
corporation law was passed by the general assembly of Tennessee, a char- 
ter was obtained with the twelve directors, two from eachsynod, as cor- 
porators, and the Southwestern Presbyterian University became a legal 
entity. Anevidenceof the high hopes and large plans cherishedis found 
in the attempt of the board to raise $500,000. And this was to be only a 
nucleus. But for the present such hopes were chimerical; only $100,000 
were realized. In the meantime Stewart College continued to perform 
the functions of the larger institution by which it was to be absorbed 
It was not until 1879 that the organization and establishment of the 
Southwestern Presbyterian University was definitively completed. In 
June of that year “the board of directors abolished the curriculum and 
reorganized the school on the plan of coérdinate schools and elective 
courses.” Rey. Dr. B. M. Palmer, pastor of the First Presbyterian 
Church of New Orleans, was the first chancellor elected by the board 
of directors. Not being permitted by the Presbytery to sever his con- 
nection with his church, he was obliged to refuse the office. High 
hopes of the future of the university had been entertained because of 
Dr. Palmer’s extended influence and great popularity. After his decli- 
nation of the chancellorship the position was offered to Rey, John N. 
Waddel, D. D., LL. D., and accepted. 
FACULTY. 
The faculty chosen was as follows: Rev. John N. Waddell, D. D., LL. 
D., professor of philosophy; Rev. Charles R. Hemphill, A. M., professor 
of ancient languages; James Dinwiddie, A. M., professor of mathe- 
maties; John W. Caldwell, A. M., M. D., Stewart professor of natural 
sciences; Samuel J. Coffman, professor of modern languages, and 
Rey. J. B. Shearer, D. D., professor of history, English literature, 
and rhetoric, and provisional professor of biblical instruction, In

188? Mr J.J. McComb, of New York, endowed the chair of history, — 
English literature and rhetoric, and Rev. Dr. Robert Price, of Vicks- 
burg Miss , was called to fill it. The formation of a divinity school had 
been part of the original plan. In 1885 this plan was realized. A school 
of divinity was organized with four Jepartments: Didactic, polemic, 
and historic theology; practical theology; biblical and ecclesiastical 
history, and Hebrew and New Testament Greek. Rev. Joseph R. Wil- 
son, D. D., of Wilmington, N. C., was called to a chair in this school. 
Chancellor Waddell resigned in 1888 on account of failing health, and 
Rey. O. C. Hersman, D. D., professor of Hebrew literature and New Tes- 
tament exegesis in Columbia Theological Seminary, Columbia, S. C., 
was elected to succeed him. 
The academic and divinity faculties now stand as follows:

Joseph R. Wilson, D. D., Theology and Homiletics, Palmer Professor of. 
Rey. Robert Price, D. D., Ecclesiastical History and Church Polity. 
Rey. Joseph Bardwell, D. D., Biblical History. 
Although John Hopkins University and the University of Virginia 
are represented in the faculty, Princeton men are the most numerous.! 
As already seen, the board of directors are the legal trustees of the 
university. In them is vested the ultimate authority. In 1886 their 
number was reduced from twelve to ten by the withdrawal of the 
synod of Texas. 
DEGREES. 
The university confers the degrees of A. M., A. B., B. P., B. S., and 
B.D. Diplomas are given, also, in “commercial science.” The elec- 
tive system in the selection of studies is in vogue. An exception to   
1Recently Chancellor Hersman has resigned and been succeeded by Rev. James M. 
Rawlings, D. D. Prof. Coffman, also, is no longer a member of the faculty. In lieu 
of the chairs of ancient and of modern languages have been established the chairs of 
Latin and French and of Greek and German. Prof. T, 0. Deaderick has been clected 
to the former and Dr. G. F. Nicolassen, nine years professor of ancient languages, to 
the latter.
-P-A-G-E-278

this is the study of the Bible, which is compulsory upon all students in 
the regular classes. These two salient features in the curriculum are 
due more than to anyone else to Dr. J. B. Shearer. In their adoption 
is perpetuated the influence of one of the most prominent founders of 
the institution. As illustrating the system we may turn to the require- 
ments for the degree of bachelor of arts. This degree requires “ grad- 
uation in Latin and one other language, ancient or modern, the ‘ Bible 
course proper,’ and three of the four schools of pure mathematics, nat- 
ural sciences, philosophy and history, English literature and rhetoric, 
or the equivalent of three, in which chemistry and one class of natural 
philosophy shall be required.” Master of arts is not granted to bacca- 
laureate graduates of a certain number of years’ standing, but is given 
on the same principle as the bacealaureate degrees, the requirements, 
of course, being severer. 
Tn consonance with the fact that Southwestern Presbyterian Univer- 
sity is under the care of a Christian church, tuition is free to the sous 
of Presbyterian ministers and to all candidates for the ministry, of 
whatever denomination. The city of Clarksville is perpetually entitled 
to ten scholarships. They are awarded upon competitive examination 
in the highest class of the city schools, and by virtue of them the hold- 
ers receive free tuition for two years. 
PLANT AND ENDOWMENT. 
The campus, containing 24 acres and crowned with a grove of fine 
old oaks, lies in the northern part of the town, overlooking the Cum- 
berland River. Of the two buildings on the grounds, both of which are 
used for college purposes, one was erected years ago for the use of 
Masonic University. Its architecture isof atype new rare. In appear- 
ance itis not unlike the castellated structures of the MiddleAges. The 
university owns three buildings outside the campus, the chancellor’s 
residence and two buildings occupied by students. 
The library contains 5,000 or 6,000 volumes. Probably the most val- 
uable part of it is the selection of scientific books, the giftof Prof. Wil- 
liam M. Stewart. In the natural history cabinet the collection of shells 
is worthy of mention. There are 16,000 gathered from various parts of 
the world. The outfit of physical and astronomical apparatus is com- 
plete enough for the performance of class experiments. 
There are two endowed professorships, the McComb professorship of 
history, English literature, and rhetoric, salary $1,500, and the Palmer 
professorship of theology, salary $2,000. The chancellor has a guavr- 
anteed income of $1,500 and receives in addition a portion of the tui- 
tion fees. A salary of $1,000, with a share of the tuition fees, is attached 
to each of the remaining professorships. 
The university has a property of about $230,060. Thisincludes both 
the endowment and nonproductive property. The value of the grounds 
and buildings is estimated to be about $60,000, There are $69,000 in

Tennessee certificates of indebtedness, on which the interest is paid 
semiannually. There are, besides, about $40,000 in other bonds and in 
real estate; the McComb endowment of $30,000; the endowment of the 
Palmer professorship of theology, $33,500; and the Edward Clark 
Steers memorial fund of $10,000 for the support of young men studying 
for the ministry. 
ATTENDANCE AND GRADUATES. 
The university draws its patronage from a wide territory. Lastyear 
fifteen States, the Indian Territory, and Japan were represented. Very 
naturally, however, Tennessee and contiguous States furnish the greater 
part of the students. In 1886-67, of 150 in attendance about 50 per 
eent were from Tennessee and 334 per cent from Mississippi. At the. 
reorganization of the college in 1879 the enrollment of students was 76; 
in 189091 it was 122, 
In the years 1854 and 1855 six bachelors of arts and three bachelors 
of science were graduated from Masonic University. rom 1856 to 1891, 
inclusive, there have been graduated from Stewart College and South- 
western Presbyterian University seventy-eight bachelors of arts, four 
bachelors of science, six bachelors of philosophy, eighteen bachelors of 
divinity, twenty-seven masters of arts, and seventeen whose degrees 
are not stated. 
REV. JOHN N. WADDEL, D. D., LL. D. 
A history of Southwestern Presbyterian University would not be com- 
plete without special mention ofthe man who was its chancellor for the 
first nine years of its existence, His reputation is not local; he has 
Jeng been known as one of the most prominent educators in the South. 
Preéminence in teaching is his by birthright. His father was Moses 
Waddel, the pioneer of classical education in South Carolina and Geor- 
gia. John N. Waddel was born at Wilmington, the seat of that train- 
ing school where so many distinguished Southerners were educated. 
Young Waddel taught here after graduating in 1829 at the University 
of Georgia. In 1841 he opened a classical school at Montrose, Miss., 
and made such a reputation as a teacher that in 1848 he was elected to 
the chair of ancient languages in the University of Mississippi. In 
1857 he resigned to accept the same chair in the La Grange (Tennessee) 
Synodical College. During one year of the war (1863~64) he was 
commissioner to the army. After the war he was recalled to the Uni- ~ 
versity of Mississippi to serve aschancellor. He continued in this posi- 
tion for nine years. ‘ From 1874 to 1889 he was secretary of education 
for the Southern Presbyterian Church, having his office at Memphis, 
Tenn.” In 1879 he became chancéllor of the Southwestern Presbyterian 
University. He did some of the best work of his life as head of this 
young and struggling school. A steadier hand is needed at the helm 
to safely pass the inshore breakers than is needed far out at sea. 
   
-P-A-G-E-282
220 HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE. 
Though possessed of wide learning, Dr. Waddel’s success as a teacher 
has been due rather to the man than to the scholar. He has taught 
through his character rather than through his attainments. Hismold- 
ing influence upon the minds and hearts of young men is seen in the 
fruition of their maturer years. . 
As a disciplinarian he was eminently successful, though it is hard to define the 
secret of his power. He had the happy faculty of ruling young men seemingly with- 
out effort and without any appearance of harshness. Students under him seemed to 
have no desire to misbehave. They were insensibly stimulated to conduct them- 
selves as Christian gentlemen. Very little was said by him to students in the way 
of reproof. Still, when young men failed to do their duty and were forming bad 
habits, he was very firm and decided, though kindly, in his dealings with them. 
This firmness and decision of character he retained to the very last year of his teach- 
ing. * * * Dr. Waddel was always perfectly just and liberal in his government 
and very free from prejudice, and seemed to have an intuitive insight into charac- 
ter. Students rarely attempted to deceive him. * * * He was very happy in 
his relations to the various members of the different college faculties over which he 
presided as chancellor, and was beloved and venerated by the professors as well as 
the students. He was above all sordid or mercenary motives, and his whole charac- 
ter was such as to inspire in all who came under his influence nobler and higher 
aspirations. 
Early in life Dr. Waddel was ordained a minister of the Presbyterian 
Church. The following is from the pen of a friend: 
He was a man of strong faith and reliance on God for every emergency of life and 
forits daily duties as well. It was impossible for any one to know him and not per- 
ceive this. His Christianity was not hidden under a bushel, but set upon a candle- 
stick, and gave light to all around him. * * * He was singularly free from ego- 
tism, and ascribed all his success—which he was inclined to underestimate—to the 
blessing and favor of God. 
It was in the spirit of humility that he retired from the chancellor- 
ship of Southwestern Presbyterian University and surrendered the 
keys to his successor: 
My too partial friends have been pleased to pass a verdict of unqualified approba- 
tion upon the administration of the university under my superintendence. Now, 
while I can not too highly prize such expressions of confidence as are thus cordially 
and voluntarily given me, at the same time I have never dared to appropriate this 
honor or credit to myself as an individual. If any good has been accomplished by 
my supervision during the last nine years, my agency in it is only that of a humble 
instrument in the hand of God, and to Him be all the honor and the glory! I joy- 
fully acknowledge that I was so honored of Him in answer to earnest daily and hab- 
itual prayer for wisdom and for grace.

  CHAPTER VIII 
SOUTHWESTERN BAPTIST UNIVERSITY, 
WEST TENNESSEE COLLEGE. 
In 1846 the United States released its title to certain lands in Tennessee on con- 
dition that the State should out of the proceeds set apart $40,000 toward the estab- 
lishment of a college at Jackson. Accordingly in the next year the treasurer of the 
State was directed to issue to West Tennessee College, at Jackson, a warrant for that 
sum. 
This was the origin of West Tennessee College. The Government 
gift was supplemented by private subscriptions; grounds were bought 
and a building erected; and $40,000 worth of Tennessee 5 per cent 
bonds were purchased as a permanent endowment. The college was 
prosperous both before and after the war. Among the many educa- 
tional institutions that suffered it was one of the very few that came 
out of the great conflict with little or nohurt. The endowment was not 
lost, but instead it accumulated interest. The college was reopened. 
in 1865 with Rey. William Shelton, D. D., as president, and was more 
largely attended than it had ever been before the war. In 1869 Dr. 
Shelton and all the faculty resigned, and Rev. E. L. Patton, A. M., was 
elected president. in 1874, as we shall see, West Tennessee College 
was merged in the Southwestern Baptist University. 
West Tennessee College was one of the three colleges in the State that_ 
have received aid from the Federal Government, and the only one that 
owed its birth to the nation’s bounty. The assistance came through 
the State, and this fact was urged by the college as entitling it to the 
patronage of the people of the State. The college is noteworthy, too, 
in that it was not a denominational school, as most Tennessee colleges 
are. The following appeal for support based on the foregoing consid- 
erations is extracted from the catalogue of the year 1866~67: 
It (West Tennessee College) is a State institution. It belongs to the people of the 
State. It was endowed from the treasury of the State. Let it receive the patron- 
age of the people of the State. The trustees intend to secure the best teachers of 
the South; and as far as possible they will have the various churches of the South 
represented in the faculty, so that all the Southern people of all denominations may 
patronize it. 
Collegiate instruction was not the only kind of instruction given; 
there were an academic, a grammar, and even a primary department. 
Military discipline and the school system obtained. There were five 
schools: Mental and moral science, Latin, Greek, mathematics, and

physical science. For the degree of A. M. graduation in all five 
schools was required; for A. B., graduation in all but Greek; and for 
“B. P., graduation in all but Latin and Greek. 
UNION UNIVERSITY. 
After several vain attempts to establish a school of high grade in 
different parts of Tennessee for the advancement of their denomina- 
tion and the education of their ministry, the Baptists of the State, 
working through the Baptist General Association of Tennessee and 
the Vennessee Baptist Educational Society and aided by the Baptists 
of North Alabama and Mississippi, founded Union University, at Mur- 
freesboro. Rey. Joseph H. Eaton, president of the university from its 
opening, in 1848, until his death, in 1859, had the greatest hand in its 
founding and in its subsequent success. Dr. Eaton is one of the most 
distinguished educators in the history of Tennessee. That the people 
of Murfreesboro appreciated his character and ability is shown by the 
fact that they raised for him a special endowment of $10,000. The fol- 
lowing characterization of Dr. Eaton is taken from Cathcart’s Baptist 
Encyclopedia: 
Dr. Eaton was aman of great earnestness, laboring with an untiring zeal that noth- 
ing could thwart. As an educator he had but few equals, being distinguished for 
his power of imparting instruction and stimulating a love of knowledge; for a 
thorough control over students, shown in discipline and in influence upon their 
characters; and for his ability to win the affection of his pupils. As a preacher Dr. 
Eaton was earnest and impressive, of impassioned utterance and rapid delivery. 
His power to fix the attention and impress his thoughts upon his hearers has seldom 
been equaled. He won the enthusiastic devotion of those who knew him, of all 
classes and grades of society. His fellow-ministers, professors, the churches to which 
he preached, his many students, and his servants all loved him as few men are 
loved. Handsome in person, gracious in presence, genial in manners, and winning 
in conversation, he was eminent in the qualities which make men charming in the 
home circle, as he was in those which make a great teacher and preacher. There 
was about him a sense of reserved power. The strength of the man was always felt 
beneath his genial graciousness. His children and his students would face any 
danger rather than have him know that they had been guilty of a dishonorable 
action, so much did they dread the glance of his eye, so much did they value his 
approving smile. His virtues live in the memories of all who knew him. 
Union University was chartered in 1842, but did not open its doors 
till January, 1848, It began operations upon the faith of a pledged 
endowment fund of $55,000. This fund, or most of it, had been sub- 
scribed on the scholarship plan; é. ¢., a donor’s subseription was, in the 
form of free tuition, in effect refunded to him. Accordingly, we read 
in 1852 that by this means the income from tuition fees was reduced. 
nearly 50 per cent. Nevertheless, the university throve greatly. Begin- 
ning with an attendance of 50 or 60, it reached in one year before the 
war an attendance of 330. It graduated during this ante bellum 
period 173 graduates, about 38 of whom were ministers of the gospel. 
A number of them went as missionaries to foreign fields. Though not

professing to vie with the great theological seminaries, Union Univer- 
sity supported a chair of theology. And for the encouragement of 
young men studying for the ministry it charged them no tuition fees, 
whatever might be their denomination. Among those who for longer 
or shorter terms were members of the faculty at this time were Profs. 
Paul W. Dodson (mathematics), J. M. Pendleton (theology), George 
W. Jarman, and William Shelton. Prof. Jarman was afterwards presi- 
dent of Southwestern Baptist University, as was also Prof. Shelton. 
We have already seen that the latter served as president of West 
Tennessee College from 1865 to 1869. 
Union University was brought low by the ae of war. From May, 
1861, to January, 1868, her operations ceased. Endowment was lost, 
apparatus and library were scattered or destroyed, and buildings dis- 
mantled. To deepen the gloom of the prospect, there were unpaid 
debts hanging over the university. On the 7th of July, 1868, it owed 
$24,155.53. But the aspect of affairs brightened. The greater part of 
the debt was raised, and, considering to what straits the university had 
been brought, it experienced a marvelous revival. In 1869 the prop- 
erty was transferred to the Tennessee Baptist Educational Society, to 
be held in trust for educational purposes, under and by the direction 
of the trustees of the university. The first president and faculty after 
the war were: Rey. Duncan H. Selph, A. M., president; Geo. W. Jar- 
man, A. M., professor of ancient languages; T. T. Eaton, A. M. (son of 
the first president), professor of mathematics; and J. M. Phillips, prin- 
cipalof preparatory department. In January, 1871, Dr. Selph resigned 
and Rey. Charles Manly, D. D., was chosen in his place. For the three 
years ending 1871~72 the attendance was 150,181, and 161, respectively. 
The school system prevailed, there being seven schools: Moral philos- 
ophy, English, Latin, Greek, mathematics, natural science, and mod- 
ern lauiinves. M. A. was eaten on the completion of seven, B. A. 
of six, and B. P. of five schools. 
Tn October, 1873, Union University closed its doors, the immediate 
oceasion being the prevalence of cholera in Murfreesboro and the great 
financial panic of 1873. Deeper down, the reason was to be found in 
the hope that a change of location might be utilized to secure an en- 
dowment; in a sentiment that had grown up among the Baptists in 
favor of unification both in educational work and in church organiza- 
tion; and in the belief that, such unification accomplished, there would 
be a broader and surer basis for a denominational college. Unification 
along the former line seemed more likely of consummation than unifi- 
eation along the latter. But unexpectedly unification along both lines 
was achieved at once. In October, 1873, the General Association of 
Middle Tennessee and North Alabama passed resolutions favoring the 
establishment of a central university for the Baptists of the Southwest. 
The West Tennessee Baptist Convention and the trustees of Union 
University expressed their approval of the resolutions. In April, 1874,
-P-A-G-E-286
224 HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE. 
accordingly, a convention was held at Murfreesboro to consider and 
settle the educational question. The result of the meeting was unifi- 
cation both in church organization and in education. The Tennessee 
Baptist Convention, comprising the Baptists of the whole State, was 
formed, and steps were taken to found a university. A committee on 
location composed of three representatives from each of the three grand 
divisions of the State was appointed. The choice of the committee 
fell upon Jackson as the site of the proposed university. The citizens 
of Jackson and Madison counties had subscribed $60,000 in notes and 
real estate, and West Tennessee College had offered its property and 
endowment, valued at $90,000, on condition that an endowment of 
$300,000 should be raised for the new institution within ten years, 
additional time to be allowed if unforeseen hindrances should inter- 
pose. At a called meeting of the Tennessee Baptist Convention in 
August, 1874, the choice of the locating committee was ratified and 
arrangements were made for opening the 
SOUTHWESTERN BAPTIST UNIVERSITY. 
The convention elected a board of thirty-five trustees, and provided 
for its perpetuation by directing that seven of its members should go 
out every year, their places being filled by the board itself. The Ten- 
nessee, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, and Arkansas Baptist 
Conventions were to be asked to make nominations when vacancies 
occurred, and from these nominations the vacancies were to be filled. 
Not less than thirty of the thirty-five trustees should be members in 
good standing of regular Baptist churches. The board of trustees 
proceeded at once to organize themselves and to set the university 
-going. The first year only the academy or preparatory department 
was opened. But August 30, 1875, the college proper was opened. 
The attempt to raise the $300,000 of endowment failed. In 1876, the 
Centennial of American Independence, the Baptists of America made 
special efforts to endow their colleges and universities. Another 
attempt was made to raise the $300,000 endowment for the Southwest- 
ern Baptist University, but it met with little or no success. In 1890, 
however, $30,000 were secured, and the trustees of West Tennessee 
College transferred to the trustees of the Southwestern Baptist Univer- 
sity the college grounds and buildings, valued at $50,000, and the col- 
lege endowment of $40,000 in 6 per cent State bonds. The interest- 
bearing endowment of the university is thus brought up to $70,000. 
Work is being done to increase it still further. The American Baptist 
Educational Society has offered to give $10,000 if $40,000 more are 
raised by January 1, 1892. The indications are that the sum will be 
raised. Dr. William Shelton was president of the university from 1875 
to 1877. For the next thirteen years there was no president, but Prof. 
George W. Jarman, LL. D., was chairman of the faculty. In 1890 he 
severed his connection with the university, and the long vacant presi-

deney was filled by the election of Dr. G. M. Savage. The present 
faculty stands as follows: 
G. M. Savage, A. M., LL. D., professor of philosophy. 
H. C. Ivby, A. M., professor of mathematics. 
T. J. Deupree, A. M., M. D., professor of natural science. 
Clarence C. Freeman, A. M., professor of English and German. 
Alfred M. Wilson, A. M., PH. D., professor of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. 
W. D. Powell, A. M., professor of 
S. M. Bain, A. B., assistant professor of natural science and French. 
H. ©. Jameson, professor in charge of commercial department. 
A. J. Brandon, A. B., principal of the academic department. 
The number of students in attendance in 189091 was 227. There is 
an academy, or preparatory department. Both sexes are admitted to 
the university. Since the opening of the institution there have been 
52 male graduates and 1 female graduate. In 1887 the board of 
trustees made the alumni of Union University alumni of Southwestern 
Baptist University.1. The Alumni Association of Union University have 
always recognized the Southwestern Baptist University as their alma 
mater. The latter institution is really a continuation of the former.   
MEMPHIS HOSPITAL MEDICAL COLLEGE. 
The Memphis Hospital Medical College, of Memphis, sustained for a 
time a nominal relationship to the Southwestern Baptist University, 
but this relationship no longer exists. The college was founded in 
1878 by Drs. W. E. Rogers, F. L. Sim, R. B. Nall, Heber Jones, and A. 
G. Sinclair, but on account of epidemics it was not opened until October, 
1880, There have always been 10 professors, from 3 to 5 lecturers, and 
5 quiz-masters, with from 1 to 3 practical anatomy demonstrators. The 
matriculates for the last three years, respectively, including 1891-92, 
have numbered 176, 222, and 256. The institution has graduated, all 
told, 486 men. Two years are necessary to complete the course. The 
scholastic year has been heretofore five months in length, but with the 
present year it becomes six months.

FIRST LITERARY INSTITUTION IN THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY.—SAMUEL DOAK, “THE 
APOSTLE OF LEARNING AND RELIGION IN THE WEST.” 
The first school in Tennessee and the first literary institution in the 
Mississippi Valley was founded by Samuel Doak about the year 1789. 
Like other pioneer teachers and preachers in Tennessee Doak was a 
Scotch-Irish Presbyterian. Samuel and Jane (Mitchel) Doak emi- 
grated when very young from the north of Ireland to Chester County, 
Pa. After their marriage they removed to Augusta County, Va., where 
their son Samuel was born August 1, 1749. Young Doak wanted an 
education, and despite many difficulties he succeeded in getting it. In 
1773 he entered the junior class at the College of New Jersey, and 
graduated in 1775. He then taught school at different places, study- 
ing theology the while. He was tutor some two years in Hampden- 
Sidney College. In 1777 he became a licensed minister of the Presby- 
terian Church. After preaching for a time in southwestern Virginia 
he went to the Holston settlement, at the fork of the Watauga and 
Holston rivers, in that part of North Carolina since become upper East 
Tennessee. Here he preached ayear or two and then moved on farther 
westward, settling at Salem, on the Little Limestone, in Washington 
County. He bought land and built three log houses—a church, a school, 
andahome. Samuel Doak was the first teacher and the first preacher 
in this new land. The name of “ apostle of learning and religion in the 
West” is no misnomer. The Bibleand the schoolbook were always in 
his hand, but the rifle was never out of reach. 
Preaching one Sabbath on the frontier, a panie was produced by a messenger 
riding hastily up and exclaiming, ‘Indians! Indians! Ragdale’s family are mur- 
dered!” Mr, Doak stopped abruptly in his discourse, referred to the case of the 
Israelites in similar danger, offered a short prayer that the God of Israel would go 
with them against these Canaanitish heathen, called for the men to follow him, and 
taking his rifle led his male hearers to the pursuit. 
This is only one of several stories of a like nature that are told of 
Dr. Doak. 
Dr. Doak did not confine his ministrations to Salem congregations, 
but journeyed to and fro in the land preaching and founding churches. 
Active as a schoolmaster and a minister of the Gospel, he was not

neglectful of civil and political duties, ‘He took some part in the Revo- 
lutionary war, and was a prominent member of the Franklin convention.” 
“Tradition aseribes to him the paternity of a clause in the rejected 
constitution making provision for a university—requiring the legisla- 
ture to erect it before the year 1787, and to endow it liberally.” ‘He 
always voted, and the consideration in which he was held by the peo- 
ple generally allowed him to open the polls—in other words, to vote 
first.” 
MARTIN ACADEMY, WASHINGTON COLLEGE, 
In 1783 Dr. Doak’s school was incorporated by the legislature of 
North Carolina as Martin Academy. Two years later, we are told, 
another charter was obtained from the legislature of the State of Frank- 
lin, which had usurped the sovereignty of the mother State in these 
the outskirts of her domain. In 1795 the territory of the United States 
south of the Ohio, soon to become the State of Tennessee, raised Mar- 
tin Academy to the rank of a college, chartering it under the name of 
Washington College. Whilein Philadelphia in 1798 as a commissioner 
to the general assembly, Dr. Doak was given a number of books for~ 
his college. These books, carried on a pack horse 500 miles across the 
mountains, became the nucleus of the college library. 
DR. DOAK LEAVES WASHINGTON COLLEGE. 
Dr. Doak continued in the presidency of Washington College until 
1818, when he removed to Tusculum, Greene County. Here, in con- 
junction with his son, Samuel W. Doak, he opened a private school, 
which was called Tusculum Academy, and taught until his death in 
1829. Samuel Doak was a noble example of the courageous, somewhat 
austere Scotch Presbyterian—the Puritan of the middle and southern 
colonies. Dignified, stern, conservative—of such sturdy stuff was made 
the pioneer teacher and preacher of Tennessee. Untiring fidelity to 
duty was a notable trait. His natural ability and his scholarly attain- 
ments were considerable. He was a fine linguist. His quick ear 
detected the slightest mistake of a pupil. On his deathbed, when 
the apoplectic tendency was upon him, he spoke incoherent but good 
Latin. For the use of his classes in mental and moral philosophy he 
prepared an epitome of twenty-two lectures of his own “On Human 
Nature.” This epitome was published by his son and successor, Dr. 
John W. Doak. Of Samuel Doak and the prominent men educated by 
him Judge O. P. Temple, a graduate of Washington College at a later 
period in her history, says: 
No man of his generation perhaps did so much for the cducation of the State or 
exercised such a beneficent influence. On this hallowed spot were educated some 
of the foremost men of that generation, such as John Blair, Dr. J. G. M. Ramsey, 
L. C. Haynes, James A. Lyons, p. p., N. G. Taylor, Hon. Z. B. Vance, and others. 
The array of great pulpit orators is remarkable. I need only mention the names of 
Dr. David Nelson, Gideon Blackburn, and James Gallaher.

SUBSEQUENT HISTORY. 
Rey. John W. Doak, D. D., M. D., who succeeded his father as presi- 
dent of Washington College in 1818, died in 1820. Rev. John V. Bovell 
was then elected, and served eight years. Rey. James McLin was 
president from 1829 to 1838. The college was poor and its life was a 
struggle against adverse circumstances. Financial difficulties had 
reached a crisis. For the next two years Rev. Samuel W. Doak, D. D., 
of Tusculum Academy, filled the office of president. Joseph I. Foote, 
of Knoxville, consented to succeed him if $10,009 were raised for a new 
building and for other purposes. Subscriptions to that amount were 
secured, and Mr. Foote was created a D. D. by the trustees in order 
“that the new administration might open with the greater éclat.”. But 
as he was on his way to deliver his inaugural address and be inducted 
into office he was thrown from his horse and killed. Rey. Archibald 
Alexander Doak now took up the burden of the presidency. The insti- 
tution was still floundering in the quagmire of debt and poverty, but 
such were the qualities of the new president that the attendance of 
students was greatly increased. Those who knew him are lavish in 
their praise of this grandson of old Samuel Doak. Young and hand- 
some, learned and eloquent, brilliant and magnetic—all about him he 
knit to himself by the ties of love and admiration. Barring eighteen 
months, 1850-52, when Rey. E. Thompson Baird was president of the 
college, Doak filled the position continuously from 1840 to 1856. In 
the latter year the finances of the institution reached a very low ebb, 
and Doak and the rest of the faculty resigned. This ended for a long 
time the efforts to keep the school up to the level of a college. It was 
conducted for several years as a high school for both sexes. The Civil war 
caused the suspension of the school for two years. In 1868 it was re- 
organized as Washington Female College, with Rev. William B. Rankin 
as president. The school prospered for a time, but ultimately it lan- 
guished and died. In 1877 Rev. J. E. Alexander, having been elected 
president by the trustees, undertook to revive the institution. He was 
successful and gradually built up the school into a coeducational col- 
lege. Rev. J. W. C. Willoughby succeeded him in 1883, and has con- 
tinued at the head of the college ever since. Though not under direct 
ecclesiastical control, the institution is a school of the Northern wing of 
the Presbyterian Church. Washington College has been eclipsed by 
colleges of higher grade, larger scope, and more ample facilities, but 
she is the hoary mother of some of Tennessee’s illustrious sons, and her 
services to the State in the days when institutions of learning were few 
in number ought not to be forgotten.

GREENEVILLE COLLESE 
Greeneville and Blount colleges were both chartered in 1794, and thus 
antedate Washington Colloge as colleges, though not as literary insti- 
tutions. Hezekiah Balch, unlike many of the earlier educators and 
preachers in Tennessee, was not of Scotch-Irish, but of English extrac- 
tion, his ancestor, John Balch, having come from Somersetshire, Eng- 
land. Hezekiah was born in Maryland in 1741, raised in North Caro- 
lina, and graduated from Princeton in 1762, After teaching for some 
time he was licensed a Presbyterian preacher in 1768. He first preached 
in Pennsylvania, Virginia, and North Carolina, and not till 1783 did 
he cross the mountains and enter a more needy field. He located at 
Greeneville, Greene County, upper East Tennessee, and became a 
founder and organizer of churches. In 1794 he obtained from the Ter- 
ritorial legislature a charter for his college. But the college had yet to 
be built. So he made long tours in the South and West, raising money 
and collecting a library. In 1795 he made a trip to New England and 
became imbued with the “ Hopkinsian” doctrines. His life from this 
time on was troublous and stormy. Open, fearless, rash, and impul- 
sive, he soon became embroiled in religions controversy. His own 
church split into two bodies, and he was cited for trial before ecclesias- 
tical tribunals again and again. Of course the college suftered, if only 
from the enforced absence of its president. In 1801 Rev. Charles Coffin, 
a New England Presbyterian minister sojourning in the South for his 
health, was elected vice-president of Greeneville College, and henceforth 
was associated with Balch in its care and control. The institution 
owed almost as much to him as to its founder. He was very success- 
ful in raising funds for the college. He secured by personal efforts at 
different times over $20,000. The first three or four years of his con- 
nection with the school were spent on collecting tours. Both Coffin 
and Balch were made D. D.’s by Williams College in 1808. Dr. 
Balch died in 1810, full of years and of troubles, and Dr. Coffin took up 
his mantle. Dr. Coffin remained at the head of the college until 1827, 
when he resigned to accept the presidency of East Tennessee College, 
tendered him by the general assembly of Tennessee. 
Greeneville College never recovered from the loss of Dr. Coffin. 
It no longer enjoyed the former public favor and confidence; its efforts to obtain 
funds were various, but generally unsuccessful, and instead of retaining the invest-

ments that had supported the instructors, first the dividends and afterwards the 
principal began to be used for repairs and other expenses, until no proper faculty 
could be employed or sustained in the institution. 
In 1839 the college site was removed from 3 miles south of Greene- 
ville to Greeneville itself. From 1847 to 1854 there was an interregnum, 
during which the college building was neglected and many of the books 
and pieces of apparatus were carried off. After the War, in the year 
1868, Greeneville College was consolidated with Tusculum College, 
Tusculum, under the name of Greeneville and Tusculum College. The 
grounds and building of Greeneville College, which had been badly 
damaged by the Civil war, were sold for $700 and the remnant of the 
library was taken to Tusculum. 
TUSCULUM COLLEGE. 
We have seen that Samuel Doak lived his declining years at Tuscu- 
lam, Greene County, teaching a private school which he had there 
founded. After his death in 1829 the doors of Tusculum Academy 
were closed. {In 1835 his son, Rev. Samuel W. Doak, D. p., revived the 
school. At the reopening there were 4 pupils; in 1840 there were 87. 
After this the number was smaller. In 1842 a board of trustees for 
Tusculum Academy was incorporated with college powers. In1844 Tus- 
culum Academy became Tusculum College by act of the legislature. 
Samuel W. Doak presided over the college until his death in 1864. The 
faculty was composed usually of himself and of one or two colleagues. 
Educated under his father at Washington College, he had been for sev- 
eral years of his father’s presidency the vice-president of that institu- 
tion. His life was a long and useful one. He was a philanthropist. 
“Long before the uestion of emancipation was mooted he manumitted 
his slaves and carried them to a free State, where they might enjoy all 
the rights and privileges of American citizenship.”. He gave free tui- 
tion to hundreds of young men, and when they were too poor to pay 
board “he weleomed them to his family table without money and with- 
out price.” The course of study in Tuseulum College had two pecul-

In having no regular college classes Dr. Doak was but following a plan

was converted into a female institution, while Tusculum College was 
continued a male institution. “This temporary ecclesiastical control 
ceased with the reunion of the old and the new schools in 1869.” In 
1868 occurred the consolidation of Greeneville and Tusculum Colleges 
and the location of the resultant institution in the plant of Tusculum 
College. 
GREENEVILLE AND TUSCULUM COLLEGE. 
The presidency of Greeneville and Tusculum College was given to 
President Doak, of Tusculum College. During the years 1872~79 the 
entire management of the institution, with the exception of the per- 
formance of such functions as by charter must be performed by the 
board of trustees, was in the hands of a board of directors consisting 
of P. 8S. Feemster, S. S. Doak, M. S. Doak, and others. In 1882 Presi- 
dent Doak died, and in 1883 Rev. Jere Moore, D. D., was elected in his 
stead. In 1884 Mrs. Nettie F. McCormick and Cyrus H. McGormick, 
jr., offered to give $7,000 towards the erection of a new building 
for the college on condition that the board of trustees should raise 
an additional $4,000; that when the faculty numbered three or more 
at least two professors besides the president should be Presbyterians; 
and that the president and at least two-thirds of the board of trustees 
should always be Presbyterians. If any of these conditions were vio- 
lated the $7,000 were to be turned over to the board of aid of the Pres- 
byterian Church in the United States of America. The board of 
trustees accepted the offer, and instead of building an $11,000 struc- 
ture they built a $13,000 one. Of this sum the McCormicks gave 
$8,100 and in their honor the building was called McCormick Hall. 
The present faculty of Greeneville and Tusculum College consists of 
the president, the vice-president, of three other professors, and of an 
instructress in music. The enrollment of students for 1890-91 was 
250, of whom only 37 were in the four college classes. The remaining 
213 were in the primary, preparatory, and music departments.

MARYVILLE COLLEGE. 
SOUTHERN AND WESTERN THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY. 
Isaac Anderson, the founder of Maryville College, was born in Rock- 
bridge County, Va., in 1780, his father being a Scotch-Irish immigrant. 
At 21 years of age he removed with his father to Knox County, Tenn. 
His theological education, begun in Virginia, was completed under 
Samuel Carrick and Gideon Blackburn, noted Presbyterian ministers

of those early times. Young Anderson entered the ministry in 1802. 
Having already taught in Virginia and having a taste for the teacher’s 
vocation, he opened a school called Union Academy within the bounds 
of his congregation in Knox County. He made many preaching tours 
in that new country, and became strongly impressed with the need of 
more preachers. He applied to the Home Missionary Society, but it 
could not supply the need. Being a delegate to the general assembly 
of the Presbyterian Church at Philadelphia in 1819, he visited Prince- 
ton and urged the young preachers studying there to enter the new 
field in Tennessee, but to no avail. He now came to the conclusion 
that the need could be met only by educating young men on the spot, 
and that he would have to undertake the task himself. In 1812 he had 
become pastor of New Providence Church, in Maryville, 16 miles south 
of Knoxville. Here he began to teach theology to a class of 5 young 
men. ‘ Whether he began his work of instruction before submitting 
his plans to synod is not certainly known.” The Synod of Tennessee 
met in October of 1819; adopted the infant school; christened it the 
Southern and Western Theological Seminary; appointed a board of 
trustees, two-thirds ministers and one-third laymen; elected Rey. Isaac 
Anderson professor of didactic and polemic theology, and invited the 
synods of North Carolina, Kentucky, and Ohio to codperate in the en- 
terprise. This was the second theological seminary established by the 
Presbyterian Church in America. ‘Students from all quarters came, 
even from New England.” But for the patience and the fortitude of 
its founder the seminary must soon have died. All or most of the 
work of instruction devolved upon him until 1826, when Robert Hardin 
was elected professor of ecclesiastical history and church government 
and William Eagleton professor of sacred literature. For years he 
served without salary. Nay, he remitted their tuition to most theo- 
logical students and even boarded many of them at his own expense. 
In 1826 a farm was purchased and by working on this the cost of living 
to-poor students was reduced to a minimum. Not only did the synod 
render little financial assistance, but it did not give the seminary even 
the benefit of its united moral support. Difference of opinion as to the 
best location for the school was the chief cause of disagreement. Not 
uutil 1824, after the rival claims of East and West Tennessee had pro- 
duced considerable strife, was the institution permanently located at 
Maryville. Yet this was not the end of it. Down to the Civil war proj- 
ects for the removal of the seminary were broached from time to time. 
This half-hearted support of the synod was perhaps the greatest hin- 
drance to the success of the school. 
The application for a charter was the occasion of much blind and 
senseless hostility to the seminary. For many years the legislature 
refused it a charter, influenced by the belief which had become current 
that the Presbyterians were seeking to bring about a union of church 
and State; that the object of the seminary was to send out missiona-
-P-A-G-E-295

ries who should insidiously involve the State in the coils of Calvinism, 
crushing out civil and religious liberty. ‘For a time no Presbyterian 
could get an office, not even that of constable, just because he was sup- 
posed to be in favor of having Presbyterianism made the established 
religion of the country.” At last, when a charter was obtained in 1842, 
it provided that the trustees should be elected by the county court. 
This vexatious provision was removed in 1846, and the election of trus- 
tees was committed to the synod. For some years the school had been 
becoming less and less of a theological seminary and more and more of 
a college, The charter name of the institution, 
MARYVILLE COLLEGE, 
bore evidence to the change. The professors at the date of the charter 
were Rey. Isaac Anderson, theology; Rev. Fielding Pope, mathematics, 
and Rey. J. S. Craig, languages. 
In 1857 Dr. Anderson, now grown infirm with age, was gathered to 
his fathers, and the Rey. John J. Robinson was elected to the presi- 
dency. The year before Rev. Thomas J. Lamar had been appointed to 
the chair of sacred literature. He was to play a chief part in the future 
history of the school. At the time of Dr. Anderson’s death Maryville, 
College was at alow ebb. A new building had been begun, but not 
finished, and the $7,000 spent on it seemed lost. Rumors were rife - 
that the college funds had been mismanaged, and a new project to 
change the location of the school was born. 
In 1857 oceurred the split in the New School Presbyterian Church, 
by which nineteen southern presbyteries withdrew and formed the 
United Synod of the Presbyterian Church in the United States. In 
1857 the Synod of Tennessee also severed its old connections, and in 
1858 it entered into a kind of anomalous union with the United Synod. 
In a pastoral letter addressed to the churches under its care it declared 
that in taking this step it did not commit itself to any opinion on the 
slavery question, but simply took the ground that “the discussion and 
agitation of the subject of slavery, except as regards the moral and 
religious duties arising out of the relation of master and slave,” should 
“be excluded ” from their “ecclesiastical meetings; that, slaveholding 
not being in the constitution of the Presbyterian Church, the discussion 
and management of slavery as a political institution should be left to 
the State.” But what became of Maryville College? It was transferred 
to the United Synod on the condition that it should revert to the Synod 
of Tennessee whenever the United Synod should cease to exist, a pro- 
vision which determined the subsequent character and history of the 
institution. 
In 1861 the college was closed. Forty-two years of its existence had 
passed—years of constant struggle against adverse fortune. No pro- 
fessor had ever received as much as $500 a year, while the average 
salary had been about $300. The endowment was only $16,000. It

belonged to the chairs of theology and of sacred literature. The col- 
lege owned the large, unfinished building already spoken of and two 
other buildings besides, and had collected a library of 6,000 volumes. 
The attendance had been fairly good for those days, ranging the greater 
part of the time from 50 to 100. The most prominent feature of the 
college had been its religious character. Said Dr. Anderson: “If any 
one passion has governed me more than another it is to have qualified, 
devoted Presbyterian ministers greatly multiplied.” The school had 
sent 150 young men into the ministry, and it had been the constant 
subject of synodical discussions and synodical planning; church and 
school were in closest relationship. 
In 1864 the United Synod of the Presbyterian Church in the United 
States lostits separate existence and was merged in the general assem- 
bly of the Presbyterian Church of the Confederate States. Maryville 
College now reverted to the Synod of ‘Tennessee though not without a 
lawsuit. In 1865 the Synod of Tennessee held its first meeting in three 
years. Before the war the synod contained some proslavery elements. 
These were all absent now. The synod expressed its disapproval of 
the action of the United Synod and declared its adherence to the north- 
ern church. Maryville College boasts of its unswerving loyalty to the 
Union and of its uncompromising hostility to slavery. Dr. Anderson 
had gone so far as to declare in 1832 “that the man who silently thought 
of dissolving the Union ought to be hung and, if he spoke it, deserved 
some severer fate.” This spirit, though of course not in so objection- 
able a form, still lingers in the halls of Maryville College. In 1868 
the Synod of Tennessee passed a resolution “that no person having the 
requisite moral and literary qualifications for admission to the privi- 
leges of Maryville College shall be excluded by reason of race or color.” 
This, it is said, is the only old college in the South having coeducation 
of the races. Without it the assistance of the Freedmen’s Bureau, 
amounting in all to $16,000, would never have been extended. 
During the war Maryville College was closed, her buildings were 
used as barracks and left in ruins by the contending armies, and her 
library was almost destroyed. In 1864 what remained of the library 
and the real estate was sold for debt by order of court. Of the ea- 
dowment of $16,000, two-thirds were lost. -Yet, little as it looked like 
it, Maryville College was ere long to enter upon an era of greater pros- 
perity than she had ever known before. Prof. Lamar was sent North 
to solicit funds, but he did not raise enough money to pay his expenses. 
The prospect seemed gloomy enough. Nevertheless, Mr. Lamar, as 
sole professor, opened the college in the fall of 1866 with 13 students. 
“The next year he was elected professor of Greek and Rey. Alexander 
Bartlett was elected professor of Latin. In 1868 Rev. P. M. Bartlett, 
D. D., was elected president. Now began the era of prosperity. Dr. 
Bartlett and Prof. Lamar raised $60,000, mostly at the North, with 
which 65 acres of land were bought and four buildings were erected, 
 
-P-A-G-E-297
  
JACKSON COLLEGE. 235 
viz, a professor’s house, two large three-story dormitories capable of 
accommodating 130 students, and a large three-story brick for college 
purposes. For fifteen years two friends of the college contributed an- 
nually from $2,000 to $3,000 toward meeting its current expenses. In 
1880 Prof. Lamar was appointed agent to raise an endowment. By 
1883 $100,000 were secured, mainly by his efforts. This fund, too, came 
mostly from the North. “The college is a beneficiary to the amount of 
$100,000 in the will of the late Daniel B. Fayerweather, of New York, 
and is to receive $50,000 additional by the distribution made of other 
funds by the residuary legatees.” These munificent gifts, added to 
other small foundations, raise Maryville College to an enviable place 
among the smaller Tennessee colleges, most of which have little or no 
endowment, 
Prof. Lamar died in 1887. Lamar Memorial Library Hall was built 
in his memory. During the past year another building, a residence for — 
the president, has been erected. The college grounds, 250 acres in 
extent, are elevated and undulating and command a splendid view of 
the Cumberland Mountains on the north and of the Smoky Mountains 
on the south. The attendance during 1890-91 was 325, of whom 116 
were college students proper and 219 preparatory students. Since the 
war the existence of other schoolsof theology has obviated the necessity 
of a theological department at Maryville. More than 50 of the gradu- 
ates of this period have entered the ministry. Eighteen alumni.and 
undergraduates have been or are foreign missionaries. The president 
of the college is Rev. Samuel Boardman, D.D. His colleagues are 4 
professors and 12 instructors.

JACKSON COLLEGE. 
Jackson College was a Presbyterian school that took its rise in a 
manual labor institute in Maury County some 10 miles from Columbia. 
About the year 1832 the institute was erected by act of the legislature 
into Jackson College. In 1837 the college was removed to Columbia. 
It was burned by the Federal Army during the war. A report of the 
board of trustees in the year 1833 tells us that the manual-labor feature 
of the institute was retained bythe college. Every student was required 
to work two hours a day. As the college was not able to build shops 
and buy tools for mechanical labor, the students had the past year 
engaged mostly in farming. They, had, with little help, cultivated 
between 50 and 60 acres of corn and 2 acres of potatoes and had cleared 
18 acres of new land. The writer of the report assures us that manu

labor is beneficial to the health of students and as evidence that it does 
not interfere with their studies says that those students who had been 
consulted concurred in saying that instead of retarding manual labor 
had accelerated their progressin study. Nevertheless, the manual-labor 
feature was abolished when the college was removed to Columbia.

FRANKLIN COLLEGE. 
Franklin College, 5 miles east of Nashville, was founded in 1845 by 
Rey. Tolbert Fanning, a prominent man among the Disciples, or Chris- 
tians. It was opened as a manual-labor school. Mr. Fanning aimed to 
bring education within the reach of the poor. The college was closed 
at the outbreak of the Civil war. The building was burned in 1866 and 
never rebuilt. The property is now devoted to the Fanning Orphan 
School.

HIWASSEE COLLEGE. 
Hiwassee College is in Monroe County, 7 miles from Sweetwater and 
2 miles from Madisonville. The former is on the East Tennessee, Vir- 
ginia and Georgia Railroad; the latter is on the Knoxville Southern 
Railroad. The design of the founders of Hiwassee College was ‘to 
afford in a rural locality to boys of limited means the opportunity 
of securing thorough mental culture at moderate expense.” The col- 
lege sprang from a school at Bat Creek camp ground, taught first 
by Dr. M. Gibson, a professor in Tusculum College, and then by 
Robert E. Doak, A.M. In order that the school might have room to 
expand into something more pretentious, four local preachers, John 
Key, Lewis Carter, John F, Gilbreath and Joseph Forshee procured 
what aid they could and put up a plain brick building for college pur- 
poses. This was in 1849. January 23, 1850, a charter was granted to 
Hiwassee College. Some years later the school passed under the con- 
trol of the Holston Annual Conference of the Methodist Episcopal 
Church, south. The first graduate was D. M. Key, formerly Post- 
master-General under President Hayes and now United States district 
eourt judge. . Other prominent men were educated here. One hundred 
and two preachers have studied at Hiwassee. The college owns six 
buildings and 95 acres of campus. It does preparatory as well as col- 
legio+- work and teaches telegraphy, typewriting, and stenography.

BETHEL COLLEGE. 237 
BETHEL COLLEGE. 
“ Bethel College is the property of the Cumberland Presbyterian 
church, held and controlled by the West Tennessee synod for educa- 
tional purposes.” Itwas founded by the West Tennessee synod in 1850 
and located at McLemoresville. Its establishment was opposed on the 
ground that the church already had a college at Lebanon, Tenn., but 
the opposers were outvoted. Many students came to Bethel College 
in ante bellum days. Nearly everything was lost in the Civil war. 
Little or nothing was done towards reopening the school until 1871 and 
1872. West Tennessee synod then codperated with the board of trus- 
tees in resuscitating the college and removing its site to McKenzie, 
Carroll County, at the junction of two important railroads, for the rail- 
roads had passed, McLemoresville by, leaving Bethel Céllege off the 
highways of the world’s life and thought. 
Bethel College differs little from other small colleges in the State. 
It matters not whether an applicant for admission is desirous of learn- 
ing to read Euripidesor MeGufiey’s First Reader, he is received in either 
ease. The enrollment in 1890-91 was 275. How many of these were 
primary and preparatory students the catalogue does not state. The 
school has no endowment. It once had a small endowment, but it was 
lost in the war. Coeducation of the sexes has prevailed since the col- 
lege was removed to McKenzie. There are a ministers’ department, a 
teachers’ department, and a commercial department. Music and art 
are taught. The college is to be commended for not making the mas. 
ter’s degree as cheap a thing as some colleges make it. At Bethel the 
degree is conferred, not because one has lived three years after taking 
his bachelor’s degree and is willing to pay $5 for a diploma, but because 
he has completed a prescribed course of post-graduate study. The 
presidents of Bethel College have been Rev. J. N. Roach, A. B.; Rev. C. 
J. Bradley; Rev. Azel Freeman, D.D.; Rev. Felix Johnson, D. D.; Rey. 
B. W. McDonnold, D. D.; Rev. J. 8. Howard, A. M.; Rev. W. W. Hen-

rill again, who is the present incumbent.

CARSON AND NEWMAN COLLEGE. 
In 1851 the Baptist Educational Society of Hast Tennessee founded 
at Mossy Creek the Mossy Creek Missionary Baptist Seminary, with 
the special object of educating teachers and preachers of the Baptist 
denomination. Having compassed the end for which it was formed, 
the society merged its powers in those of the board of trustees of the 
seminary, and ceased to have an existence of its own. In 1855 the 
name of the school was changed to Mossy Creek College. During the 
   
-P-A-G-E-300
  
238 HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE. 
Civil war the large brick buildings of the college, three in number, were 
dismantled and the institution almost ruined. Tor this loss no indem- 
nity was ever received from the Federal Government. In 1880 Mossy 
Creek College became Carson College, in honor of the memory of James 
Harvey Carson, who had left his fortune of some $15,000 to assist young 
men studying for the ministry. In 1889 the school underwent a trans- 
formation more radical than a change of name; it became coeduca- 
tional by union with Newman Female College, a school for girls, which 
had been running since 1885 in the old buildings of Carson College. 
The united schools were called Carson and Newman College. This 
experiment in coeducation is pronounced asuccess. The annual enroll- 
ment of students exceeds 300, a large portion of whom are in the col- 
legiate department. A new college building is now being put up. 
Although Carson and Newman College has no organic connection with 
the church, its board of trust being independent and self-perpetuat- 
ing, it is regarded as the Baptist college of East Tennessee. Rey. W. 
A. Montgomery, D. D., LL. D., president of the college and professor of 
metaphysics and theology since 1888, is one of the ablest ministers in 
the denomination; a man of strong convictions and rugged character, 
of logical and forceful mind. 
LOOKOUT MOUNTAIN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION, 
Just after the the war, when philanthropic people at the North were 
expending much wealth and energy upon the evangelization and edu- 
cation of the freedmen, Mr. C. R. Robert, of New York and others con- 
ceived the idea of establishing at some central, easily accessible point 
in the South a school for the education of white youth of both sexes. 
A spot 2,000 feet above the level of the sea on the summit of Lookout 
Mountain, near the Georgia State line, 5 miles from Chattanooga, was 
selected, and over 200 acres of land with some Government buildings 
standing thereon were purchased. Forty thousand dollars completed 
the buildings and equipped them for school purposes. The compre- 
hensive name of Lookout Mountain Educational Institution was an elas- 
tie designation, intended to fit the school in whatever direction it might 
expand. The college classes were very small, and the institution was 
rather an academy and a normal school than a college. Nine hundred 
and fifty-three students were enrolled from the opening of the school in 
May, 1866, till the closing in June, 1872. Several thousand dollars 
were expended in helping needy students, the money coming from dona. 
tions of the founders and others, from the Peabody appropriations for 
the normal department, and from various benevolent and educational 
society funds. But the institution had serious odds to fight against, 
among them protracted and vexatious litigation. These discourage- 
ments led Mr. Robert to close the school, sell the property, and trans- 
mit the proceeds to the trustees of Robert College, Constantinople.

EAST TENNESSEE WESLEYAN COLLEGE AND EAST TENNESSEE WESLEYAN UNIVERSITY. 
At the reorganization of the Holston Annual Conference of the Metho- 
dist Episcopal Church, in the autumn of 1865, the need of a college for 
the white membership of the church in the central South was discussed. 
The recognition of this need and a desire to supply it led to the found- 
ing of East Tennessee Wesleyan College, at Athens, Tenn., under a 
charter obtained from the general assembly of March 9, 1866. Percival 
C. Wilson, M. A., was chosen president. The following year, 1867, by 
amendment of its charter, East Tennessee Wesleyan College became 
East Tennessee Wesleyan University. Among its trustees were Goy- 
ernor William G. Brownlow, Dr, John F. Spence, Dr. Thomas H. Pearne, 
and Maj. James H. Hornsby. On June 4, 1867, the board of trustees 
purchased, “for the use and behoof of the Holston Annual Conference 
of the Methodist Episcopal Church,” the property formerly occupied by 
the Athens Female College, an institution once owned and controlled 
by the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, but now gone into financial 
insolvency. This property, comprising a three-story brick building 
and 12 acres of ground, became the seat of the East Tennessee Wesleyan 
University. The first president of the school under the amended char- 
ter was Rev. Nelson E. Cobleigh, D. D., who had been for several years 
editor of Zion’s Herald, Boston. Dr. Cobleigh continued in the presi- 
dency until 1872, when he retired and assumed charge of the Metho- 
dist Advocate, of Atlanta, Ga. His successor, Rev. James A. Dean of 
Connecticut, resigned in 1875 because of the financial difficulties in 
which the college was becoming involved. Rey. John J. Manker, D. D., 
presiding elder of the Knoxville district, was then elected president, 
but declined to accept the office except upon the fulfillment of certain 
conditions. During the few months pending the final issue Dr. Manker 
performed some of the duties of the presidency, but refused to consider 
himself president. The conditions stipulated by him were not ful- 
filled, and his connection with the university came to an end. 
Rey. John F. Spence, D. D., who had been at the head of the Knoxville 
Female College from 1865 to 1868 was now called to the presidency, 
and East Tennessee Wesleyan University entered upon a long era of 
prosperity. Being a man of energy and financial ability, Dr. Spence 
imparted new life to the institution. He relieved it of debt, erected 
new buildings, and largely increased the patronage. The school re- 
eeived liberal support from the Southern Aid Society and from many 
private persons, especially from members of the Methodist Episcopal 
Church.

GRANT MEMORIAL UNIVERSITY. 
In 1886 the name of East Tennessee Wesleyan University was changed 
to Grant Memorial University. Gen. Grant had always supported the 
school and heartily sympathized with its aims. Hence it was that the 
friends of the school thought no fitter monument could be erected to 
his memory than that school itself 
CHATTANOOGA UNIVERSITY. 
Like the Fast Tennessee Wesleyan University, Chattanooga University 
was an institution of the Methodist Episcopal Church, the aim of the 
church being to make it her only university for her white conferences in 
the central South. It was established by the joint action of six con- 
ferences and of the Freedmen’s Aid Society of the Methodist Episcopal 
Church. The citizens of Chattanooga contributed liberally to the pur- 
chase of the grounds. The charter bears date June 24, 1886. It pro- 
vided for two classes of trustees—the one to be elected by the Freed- 
mews Aid Society, the other by the six conferences referred to above. 
The property of the university being owned by the Freedmen’s Aid 
Society, to the society was secured the right of reversion. The prop- 
erty is very valuable, comprising a four-story brick building and 12 
acres of ground, situated in what will in time be the center of the city, 
and so elevated as to command a magnificent view of the Tennessee 
River and of the mountains and hills around Chattanooga, including 
historic Lookout and Mission Ridge. 
Here Chattanooga University opened its doors in September, 1886. 
Its history is marked by only a fair degree of prosperity. The agita- 
tion of the race question largely accounts for this. The charter intrusted 
to the board of trustees the power of adopting rules governing the ad- 
mission of students. But the school owed its foundation to the Freed- 
men’s Aid Society, and it was feared that negroes would claim admit- 
tance. Although these apprehensions, as it afterwards appeared, had 
little warrant, yet the school was injured by them. In 1888 the Freed- 
men’s Aid Society was changed into the Freedmen’s Aid and Southern 
Education Society, and the educational work of the church among both 
whites and blacks was placed under its direction, thereby putting be- 
yond cavil the right of the society to expend money for the exclusive 
Lenefit of whites and relieving Chattanooga University of a terrible 
incubus. 
The university included five departments: The college of liberal arts, 
the academic or preparatory department, the school of theology, the 
music department, and the art department. In 1889, the year in which 
the separate existence of the college came to an end, the attendance 
was 161. Rev. Edward S. Lewis, D. D., was the president of the univer- 
sity from its organization. He was assisted in the work of instruction 
by a faculty of eight professors and instructors.

U. S. GRANT UNIVERSITY. 
In 1889 Chattanooga University and Grant Memorial University, 
institutions of the same church and occupying much the same field, 
were consolidated under one charter and one board of trustees. The 
name, U.S. Grant University, given to the consolidated schools serves 
still to recall the memory of the great soldier in whose honor Grant 
Memorial University was named. Dr. John F. Spence, president of 
Grant Memorial University, was put at the head of the new university 
with the title of chancellor. The two schools could never have heartily 
codperated with each other, nor could their union have been a real one, 
had not all grounds of rivalry been removed. Because of this and 
other obvious reasons some departments of the university were located 
exclusively at Athens, while others were located exclusively at Chatta- 
nooga. The theological and technological departments are at Athens; 
the collegiate, medical, and law departments are at Chattanooga. Pre- 
paratory and music departments, however, are found at both places. 
Such students as were pursuing the collegiate course at Athens when 
the schools were united are permitted to complete the course and grad- 
uate there. Connected with the university are seventeen scholastic 
gymnasia, or affiliated academies, having the same course of study as 
the preparatory department of the university. These academies are 
situated in Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, and Alabama, 
and are intended, of course, as feeders to the university. The medical 
department has been running since the autumn of 1889; the law school 
was organized in the summer of 1891. The technological department, 
created in response to the growing sentiment in favor of manual train- 
ing, and under the superintendency of Prof. H. G. Sedgwick, of Cen- 
tral Tennessee College, is designed to teach the general principles that 
underlie alltrades. The three years’ course includes, besides drawing 
and practical work in the shops, instruction in such subjects as phys- 
ics, mechanics, physical geography, chemistry, metallurgy, and English. 
The course affords an excellent basis for courses in engineering—civil, 
mining, mechanical. Some future day may sce the establishment of a 
department of engineering. For the year 1890-91 the total enrollment 
at Athens and Chattanooga was 622. <A large proportion of the stu- 
dents are females. 
At the close of the year 1890~91 Bishop I. W. Joyce was elected 
chancellor, vice Dr. John I’. Spence, Dr. Spence becoming financial 
agent of the university under the title of president of the university. 
In the absence of Bishop Joyce he will serve as chancellor. 
The board of trustees of U.S. Grant University is a self-perpetuating 
body, but charter stipulations as to the faith of its members, as to the 
mode of tenure of university property, and as to the policy and teach- 
ing of the university will operate effectually to keep the institution 
under the wing of the church. The property of the university both

at Athens and at Chattancoga, valued at $300,000, is owned by the 
Freedmen’s Aid and Southern Education Society, the transfer of the 
property at Athens having been effected the past year; but the rela- 
tions of the university and the society are of mutual understanding 
and not of charter stipulation, as was the case with Chattanooga 
University. 
U.S. Grant University is chartered under the laws of Tennessee and has its board 
of trustees and elects its faculty subject to the approval of this society. This is the 
understanding so long as the society contributes largely to the support of the in- 
stitution.

KING COLLEGE. 
King College is under the control of Holston Presbytery of the 
Southern Presbyterian Church, and is the only college of that branch 
of the denomination between Hampden Sidney College, in Virginia, and 
Southwestern Presbyterian University at Clarksville, Tennessee, a 
distance of 700 miles. It originated in the fall of 1866 with a gift ofthe 
Rey. James King, consisting of 25 acres of land and 3 dwelling houses 
in the suburbs of the town of Bristol. With this gift as a basis the 
Presbytery of Holston founded the Bristol high school under Rev. J. 
D. Tadlock, D.D., as principal. In 1869 the school was chartered as 
King College. Dr. Tadlock continued at its head until 1884, when he 
was succeeded by Rev. J. Albert Wallace, D. D., the present president. 
The college has a small endowment fund, but it is still cramped in its 
work and influence for want of means. Like many other schools in the 
State, it has attempted the work of a college without adequate facilities. 
It has grammar schooland preparatory departments and much of its in- 
struction is elementary. The attendance has been somewhat less than 
100; for 1890-91 it was 97. A prime object of the institution is the edu- 
cation of ministers; during its short history it has given 45 young men 
to the ministry. The insufficiency of the buildings and the proximity 
of the present location to the center of the town—the town having in 
time grown around it—have led the curators to accept gifts of land and 
money coupled with the condition of a change of location to a beauti- 
ful eminence south of the town. It is expected that the new buildings 
will be ready for occupation by September, 1892.

the cause af education. As far back as 1864 efforts were made to in- 
duce them to establish one of their schools at Memphis, but they were 
not able to do so until October, 1871, when the great Chicago fire 
destroyed several of their institutions and released many of their 
teachers. The citizens of Memphis subscribed the greater part of the - 
first installment of $5,000 paid on the college property. Financial 
difficulties and epidemics threatened the very existence of the school 
in its earlier years. But since 1879 Memphis has been a healthy city 
and the college has prospered greatly. 
The instruction given extends from the primary branches up through 
the studies of the senior college class. It embraces a business course 
and courses in music and drawing. The college is favorably known 
for the work of its students in crayon, free-hand, architectural, and 
mechanical drawing. Public exhibits are made every year and honors 
have been wor at European and American expositions. 
\ WINCHESTER NORMAL. 
On the first of January, 1872, R. A. Clark opened a school in Carrick 
Academy, Winchester, Tenn. At the beginning of the second year he 
associated with him J. M. Bledsoe. In 1878 negotiations were opened 
with J. W. Terrill which resulted in the organization of the Winches- 
ter Normal, with Prof. Terrill as president. In 1881 Prof. Bledsoe 
resigned, whereupon Greek was dropped from the curriculum and 
Latin and mathematics were cut down. In 1889 President Terrill and 
the entire faculty, with the exception of Prof. Clark, resigned. The 
trustees then made Prof. Clark president, with power to name his col- 
Jeagues. He has 12 assistants—4 male and 8 female. The Normal 
has primary, grammar school, and college departments, and offers 
courses in music, art, elocution, bookkeeping, stenography, and type- 
writing. A teachers’ class is organized each term for the benefit of 
those who intend to make teaching a profession, and the theory and 
practice of teaching are studied. The diploma of the institution is 
given on completing the schools of English and history, mathematics, 
natural science, moral philosophy, Latin and Greek. If certain special 
advanced work is done in Latin and Greek or in two modern languages 
andin English and biology the degree of A. B.is conferred. The degree 
of B.8., likewise, requires special work. The school is coeducational. 
It has. no endowment. Admitting, as it does, students of any age, the 
enrollment is naturally large. In 1890~91 it was 444. 
MILLIGAN COLLEGE.

College. Milligan College is situated in the village of Milligan, 4 miles 
from Johnson City and 30 miles from Roan Mountain, on the North 
Carolina line. Though the trustees of the college are members of 
the Christian Church, they are independent of any church control. | 
There is no endowment. Grounds and buildings are valued at $15,000. 
The institution is coeducational, Connected with Milligan College is 
Milligan Business College. There are also a preparatory department 
and anormal course for the training of teachers. J. Hopwood, A. M., 
has been at the head of the school since 1875. Last year (1890~91) 173 
students were in attendance; 101 of them were in collegiate classes. 
The first graduates were of the year 1882. There have been in all 49 
graduates.

  CHAPTER X. 
COLLEGES FOR “WOMEN. 
NASHVILLE FEMALE ACADEMY. 
Fisk’s Female Academy was chartered at Hilham, Overton county, September 11, 
1806. A female academy was chartered at Knoxville in 1811, and the female 
academy at Maysville, Blount county, was chartered in 1813. These were all the 
female academies that were chartered in Tennessee before the establishment of the 
Nashville Female Academy.! 
Early in 1816, Robert White, Thomas Claiborne, and a number of 
others resolved upon the establishment of a female academy in Nash- 
ville. July 4, 1816, they bought 3 acres of land from David MeGavack 
for the use of the academy, paying for it $1,500. August 4, 1817, the 
Nashville Female Academy was opened, with Dr. Daniel Berry and wife, 
of Massachusetts, as principals. A charter was granted by thelegisla- 
ture on the 3d of the following October. The charter appointed a 
board of seven trustees—Robert White, Robert Searcy, Felix Grundy, 
John P. Erwin, John Baird, Joseph T. Elliston, and James Trimble— 
who were to act until the first Monday in January, when they were to 
give way to a new board of seven trustees chosen by the stockholders of 
theacademy. Thereafter once a year a new board appointed in the same 
way was to supplant the old one. Dr. Berry and his wife severed their 
connection with the academy in July, 1819, and were succeeded by Rev. 
William Hume. The beautiful life and character of Mr. Hume have 
already been spoken of in relating the history of Cumberland College 
and the University of Nashville. His relations with the Nashville Fe- 
male Academy were not broken except by death. He died in 1833. 
His successor was Dr. R. A. Lapsley, who remained until 1837. Dr. 
Lapsley was followed by Dr. W. A. Scott. After a year incumbency 
Dr. Scott made way for Dr. Lapsley and Dr. C. D. Elliott as joint prin- 
cipals. In 1844 Dr. Elliott became sole principal and held the place 
as long as the life of the academy lasted. The patronage of Nashviile 
Female Academy was large. After 1850 the attendance never fell 
below 300 except once, and that was the academy’s last year, just at the 
close of the war. In 1860 the number of students in attendance was 
513. The school had a widespread reputation. At the same time it 
was thoroughly identified with Nashville, and the “Old Academy,” as

it was called, grew to be very dear to the hearts of her people. When 
Lafayette came to Nashville in 1825, it had a share in his reception. 
In 1846 it presented a flag to the First Regiment Mexican Volunteers, 
and in 1861 another to the First Regiment Confederate Volunteers. 
The academy grounds and buildings occupied 5 acres, a whole square, 
on Church street, just east of the depot of the Nashville, Chattanooga 
and St. Louis Railway. The buildings fronted 180 feet on Church 
street and ran back 280 feet. Federal soldiers took possession of the 
academy property in 1862. With the year 1861 the life of the institu- 
' tion had virtually come to an end. The resumption of 1866 was only 
a temporary resuscitation, and that not in the academy buildings, 
which were still occupied by the troops, but in the buildings of the 
Shelby Medical College, on Broad street. The academy might have 
obtained a new and lasting lease upon life had it not become the sub- 
ject of protracted litigation, which put an end totits existence.

COLUMBIA FEMALE INSTITUTE. 
The Columbia Female Institute is situated in the suburbs of Colum- 
bia. It oceupies an old-style castellated structure located on a hill 
and snrrounded by forest trees. The institute was founded as long ago 
as 1836 by Bishops Leonidas Polk and James Hervey Otey, of the Prot- 
estant Episcopal Church. The man who founded the Columbia Athe- 
neum, Rev. Franklin G. Smith, was for the fourteen years preceding 
its founding the principal of the institute. Bishop Otey labored much - 
and sacrified much in setting the institute going and in keeping it 
going after it was started. He wrote in 1852: 
Ihave spent tho best energies of my soul and passed the most vigorous years of 
my life in its [the institute’s] cause, or it would have been hopelessly ruined by its 
load of debt. For five or six years I have labored incessantly, being sometimes 
absent for six months from my house and family in my efforts to raise funds for its 
relief. Ihave worked hard and worked long without hope of fee or reward other 
than the humble expectation of being serviceable to the people among whom Provi- 
dence has cast my lot. 
In 1852 Rey. W. H. Hardin succeeded Rey. Franklin G. Smith as 
principal of the institute. With the advent of the war came Federal 
troops, who occupied the college building and injured it so that it had 
to be repaired before it could be used again for school purposes. The 
expense of restoration was borne by Rev. George T. Beckett, 8. T. D., 
who in 1866 became the principal of the institute and who has occupied 
the position ever since. 
It has been seen how much the institute owes to the unrewarded 
labors of Bishop Otey; it was now to contract another debt of grati- 
tude. In 1878 Miss Margaretta Bowles, traveling through the South

to find a school to which to donate her museum, the collection of forty 
years, selected the institute for the purpose. But this was not all; for 
the remainder of her life—nine years—she taught gratuitously in the 
inst:tute. By her will she left all her unentailed property to her 
beloved school. The Margaretta Bowles Memorial Hall keeps green 
the memory of one who did so much for the institution. The library 
of the institute contains 10,000 volumes. The faculty numbers thirteen, 
and the average attendance is about 150. 
MEMPHIS CONFERENCE FEMALE INSTITUTE. 
Memphis Conference Female Institute is-a school for girls, situated at 
Jaekson and conducted under Methodist auspices. The board of trus- 
tees fills its own vacancies, but it holds the property for the benefit of 
the Memphis conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South; 
hence the name of the school. Theinstitute was chartered in 1843 and 
opened in 1844. The building oceupied by the institute was originally 
designed for a town academy. Rey. Lorenzo Lee was the first president. 
He filled the office until 1853, when he was succeeded by A. W. Jones, 
A. M., D. D., a professor in the school from the beginning. Dr. Jones is to 
this day the head of Memphis Conference Female Institute, having been 
in its service for nearly half a century. Soon after his accession to the 
presidency he built an addition to the original college structure at his 
own expense. In 188485 another wing was added by Dr. Jones with 
some assistance from the community. Six hundred or more young 
women have received the diploma of the institute. The library num- 
bers 4,000 volumes, and the value of the grounds and buildings, aecord- 
ing to the last report of the United States Commissioner of Education, 
is $45,000. 
MARY SHARP COLLEGE. 
The claim of Mary Sharp College, that this was the first college for 
women to make Latin and Greek a requisite for graduation, is borne 
out by the following self-explanatory communication: 
DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, 
BuREAU or EDUCATION, 
Washington, D. C., July 5, 1884. 
Sm: In reply to your letter of the 8th ultimo, making inquiry “whether a 
diploma was ever given for a liberal education (one in which Latm and Greek 
were required as a sine qua non for the degree of A. B.) before 1853, at which time 
they (the trustees) conferred the degree of A. B. upon two young ladies, having 
completed the curriculum of the college,” I beg to inform you that none of the col- 
leges for “ females” reporting to this office required Latin and Greek as a sine qua 
non for the degree of A. B. prior to 1853. 
Iam, your obedient servant,

U. S. Commissioner of Education.

President of Mary Sharp College,

-P-A-G-E-316
  248 HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE. 
It may be said without invidiousness that the Mary Sharp has been 
more of a genuine college than any other female school in Tennessee. 
Her standard of scholarship has been much higher than that of the 
other schools. Her courses of study have been comprehensive and 
advanced, and her training has been careful and thorough, while tha. 
education given by so many “colleges” in the State has been little 
more than a superficial polish. The course in mathematics is quite 
severe, embracing trigonometry, conic sections, and analytical geom- 
etry, calculus, and mathematical philosophy. Theoretical and mathe- 
matical, as well as descriptive, astronomy are taught. In the senior 
Latin Gass, Livy, Tacitus’ “Germania” and “ Agricola,” and Latin 
prose composition are studied; and in the senior Greek class, Thu- 
cydides and Plato, the “Prometheus” of Aischylus, or other Greek 
tragedy, and Greek prose composition. In 1877 a new degree, L. B., 
was created, for which Latin and Greek were not required. Up to 
that time A. B. and A. M. had been the only degrees conferred. Many 
graduates of the Mary Sharp have become teachers, the possession of 
her diploma being of itself a favorable recommendation. 
Z. C. Graves, A. M., LL. D., was the only president of the college for 
thirty-nine years, from its opening in 1850 until 1889, and to him its 
high charaeter has been largely due. He is a man of great gifts as a 
teacher, and he has had some able colleagues, who have contributed 
much to the success of the school. When the eminent Joseph H. Eaton, 
chancellor of Union University, died, Dr. Graves was offered the vacant 
position, but he declined it. 
In 1850 the Tennessee and Alabama Female Institute was founded 
in the town of Winchester, and Dr. Graves was called from Kingsville, 
Ohio, to its presidency. He started with hardly any of the proper facili- 
ties, and it was three years or more before the college building was com- 
pleted and occupied. After some time Mrs. Mary Sharp, a wealthy 
widow of the vicinity, made a gift to the institute, and its name was 
changed to Mary Sharp College. This was an era of prosperity in the 
history of the institution. When Fort Donelson fell there were 321 stu- 
dents in attendance, but now they were dispersed and the college 
closed for a year. During several weeks the building was the head- 
quarters of Rosecrans’s command. Military occupation left it in a dilap- 
idated condition. Again the president had to equip the-school at his 
own expense. The advances he made caused some trouble and litiga- 
tions. In 1889 Dr. Graves’s long connection with the institution, which 
was so much the product of his own hand_and heart and brain, came 
toanend. He was succeeded by Rev. John L, Johnson, D. D., LL. D., 
who was for sixteen years professor of English literature in the Uni, 
versity of Mississippi. In 1891 Dr. Johnson resigned, and Rev. Otis 
Malvin Sutton, A. M., was elected to the presidency. Mr. Sutton is a 
young man, and will, it is hoped, infuse new life into the old college and 
bring back its pristine prosperity. \

The Mary Sharp is a Baptist institution. It sustains no official rela- 
tion to the church, but two-thirds of its 25 trustees must be Baptists. 
It has no endowment, but depends wholly on fees. Its property is 
valued at $20,000. : 
THE ROGERSVILLE SYNODICAL COLLEGE. 
Rogersville Synodical College, situated in the suburbs of Rogersville, 
East Tennessee, is the property of the Presbyterian Synod of Nashville, 
and is under the direct control of a board of trustees appointed by the 
synod. This school has passed through many hands and has seen 
many vicissitudes. The corner-stone of the Odd Fellows’ Female Semi- 
nary was laid July 4,1849, and in September of the following year the 
seminary was thrown open to students. Rev. W. D. Jones, D. D., was 
the first president. After him came Rev. A. W. Cummings, D.D., Rev. 
James Park, D. D., Rev. A. W. Wilson, Rev. A. H. Dashiell, D. D., and 
Dr. H.B.Todd. The Odd Fellows’ lodge was not able to pay the debts 
created in purchasing the original building and in making subsequent 
improvements, and the property was sold to a joint stock company, con- 
sisting of members of the Old and New School Presbyterian churches of 
the town. The Old School denomination eventually became sole owners 
of the property. Theschool prospered in the years before the war, and 
even in the earlier years of the war itself before the Federal troops 
occupied East Tennessee. The history of the college for some time after 
the war is a tangled maze. First the property was sold by order of the 
chancery court, and was bought by Northern purchasers, who had come 
to Rogersville during the war. It was again sold, and then or eventu- 
ally came into the hands of the Presbyterians. About1880it became the 
possession of its present owner, the Synod of Nashville. In 1883 Mrs. 
F. A. Ross was made principal of the college. In 1890 the present 
principal, Prof. William M. Graybill, came into office. After the war 
and prior to the incumbency of Mrs. Ross the school was in a languish- 
ing condition, except during the administration of Rev. J. W. Bach- 
man, D. D., 187273, and Rev. A. W. Wilson. Under Dr, Bachman’s 
guidance it bid fair to regain its old-time popularity and prestige. Since 
the advent of Mrs. Ross the institution has been highly prosperous, 
In 1890~91 it had 170 students and employed 13 teachers. It has no 
endowment, but it is out of debt, and owns college property worth 
$60,000. A department of dressmaking has recently been added to the 
course of instruction. After a visit to the college Rev. Dr. A. D. Mayo, 
of Boston, said of President Graybill: 
The college is fortunate above all in its president, a man of great breadth of sym- 
pathy, solid acquirements, valuable experience, and thorough knowledge of the edu- 
cational needs of the people in this interesting portion of the country. 
ST. AGNES ACADEMY. 
St. Agnes Academy is a school of the Sisters of St. Dominic, enjoy- 
ing, by virtue of its charter, collegiate rights and privileges. The

buildings stand in the center of extensive and highly improved grounds 
in a retired part of the city of Memphis. The institution dates from 
January 1, 1850. It was established through the instrumentality of 
Rev. T. L. Grace, pastor of St. Peter’s, Memphis. He secured a number 
of Sisters from the Dominican Convent at St. Catherine’s, Kentucky, 
and they were incorporated as the St. Agnes Female Literary Society. 
Previous to the war and for some years after the patronage of the school 
was large from all the Southern States, but it has fallen off since then, 
owing to the establishment ef so many other schools and to the disas- 
trous effects of yellow-fever epidemics. That St. Agnes has excellent 
graduates is evidenced by the fact that the young lady who is now for 
the second term superintendent of county schools is an alumnus of the 
academy. : 
~ CUMBERLAND FEMALE COLLEGE. 
Cumberland Female College was organized in 1850 and placed under 
the management and control of the Middle Tennessee Synod of the 
Cumberland Presbyterian Church. It was located in the town of 
McMinnville, in Middle Tennessee, at the foot of the Cumberland range, 
which is in full view east and south. The war forced the school to 
close and left of its building nothing but naked walls. Despite the 
disheartening prospect the building was refitted and the school 
reopened; and now it is on a firmer basis than ever. Recently two 
wings were added to the original college building, making a total 
frontage of over 200 feet. In 1888 the beard of trustees leased the 
property and transferred the financial management to the Cumberland 
Female College Association for a term of years, retaining for them- 
selves only such duties as the charter renders obligatory. The college 
has in all departments twelve teachers. The president, who is also 
professor of languages and natural science, is N. J. Finney, A.M. The 
- presidents since the foundation of the school have been: Rev. A. M. 
Stone, 1851~55; Rev. J. M. Gill, 185557; D. M. Donnell, A. M., 1857715 
A. M. Burney, A. M., 1871~80, and N. J. Finney, A. M., 1880.

COLUMBIA ATHENAUM. 
Columbia Athenzum is one of the old and well-established schools of 
the State and consequently enjoys the advantages which the memories 
and traditions of years always give to an institution of learning. In 
1837 Rey. Franklin Gillette Smith, A. M., who had begun teaching as 
long ago as 1812, left Lynehburg, Va., and came to live and teach in 
Columbia, Maury County, Middle Tennessee. From 1838 to 1852 he 
was the principal of the Columbia Female Institute. In 1852 he founded

the Athenzum, and in 1858 he secured its incorporation by the legisla- 
ture with a self-perpetuating board of trustees, independent of any 
external control. The Atheneum is thus free from all ecclesiastical 
restraint. Mr.Smith, assisted by his able and accomplished wife, Sarah 
Ann Smith, administered the affairs of the school until his death, in 
1866. Mrs. Smith succeeded her husband. When she died, in 1871, 
her oldest son, Robert D. Smith, A, M., stepped into her place. Thus 
the Athenzeum has never felt the friction resulting from the discordant 
policies of presidents holding. diverse views. : 
The college grounds are 16 acres in extent and lie at the western 
edge of Columbia. Grounds and buildings are worth $100,000 accord- 
ing to the published report of the United States Commissioner of 
Education for 188788. The buildings are situated on an elevation partly 
covered by a grove of forest trees and affording a wide view of the 
town and the surrounding country. The buildings are the main Doric 
structure, 115 by 75 feet; Davis Hall, the boarding department; the 
rotunda and pavilion; the rectory; the gymnasium; and various out- 
houses. The library contains nearly 10,000 volumes. There are $4,000 
worth of scientific apparatus, a large museum of natural-history speci- 
mens, and a fine art collection. At the present writing the Atheneum 
employs, including the president, twenty-three officers and teachers. 
Much of this talent is devoted to primary and preparatory pupils) The 
annual enrollment during the thirty-nine years of the Athenzum’s his- 
tory has ranged from 125 to 350 and she counts her alumni by the 
thousands. 
BROWNSVILLE FEMALE COLLEGE. 
This board could not but feel, however, that the endowment of Union University 
[Baptist college at Murfreesboro] at best but half supplied our educational desider- 
atum; could not but feel our dependence upon others in a matter of great and vital 
importance to ourselves as a denomination while we remained destitute of the means 
of educating our own daughters. 
The above is taken from a report of the board of education to the 
Baptist General Association of Tennessee in 1848. Pursuant to the 
sentiment here expressed the board had the year before applied for 
and received a charter for the Tennessee Female Institute. At the 
meeting of the Baptist General Association in 1849 the association 
requested the trustees of Tennessee Female Institute to take measures 
for putting the proposed school into operation as soon as practicable. 
In the proceedings of the West Tennessee Baptist convention in 
1850 we find that a building committee was appointed to accept $10,000 
that had been subscribed by the Baptist church of Brownsville for the 
purpose of securing the location of the female institute contemplated 
by the convention and to purchase a site in or near Brownsville. The 
committee was also authorized to raise the additional funds necessary 
to improve the site and erect a building. What connection the plans

and efforts of the Baptist General Association to establish a female 
school had with those of the West Tennessee Baptist Convention we 
do not know. The Brownsville school, it seems, obtained a charter of 
its own in 1852 under the legal name of West Tennessee Baptist 
Female College. The members of the first board of trustees were 
appointed by the West Tennessee Baptist convention. Thereafter the 
board was self-perpetuating. The school remained the property of the 
West Tennessee Baptist Convention until the latter was merged in the 
Baptist General Convention of Tennessee in 1874. Since then it has 
been owned by the Brownsville Baptist Church, although controlled 
by the self-perpetuating board of trustees. The members of the board 
are all Baptists, though not necessarily communicants of the Browns- 
ville church. 
The college was opened in September, 1851, with Rev. Harvey Ball, 
professor of languages, in charge. Rev. John B. White, A. M., presi- 
dent of Wake Forest College, North Carolina, was called to the presi- 
dency, but owing to sickness in his family he did not definitely enter 
upon his duties until September, 1853. After holding the presidency 
a year or two, Prof. White was succeeded by W. W. Hawkins, of Ken- 
tucky, who was, however, only president pro tem. Rev. Dr. William 
Shelton was president from 1856 to 1866. During the war the college 
was suspended and Dr. Shelton taught a private school in the college 
buildings. Brownsville College was fortunate enough not to suffer 
any loss to her grounds and buildings from the war. At the head of 
the college since the presidency of Dr. Shelton have been Rey. A. B. 
Cabaniss, a returned missionary to China, 1866~68; Rev. I. R. Bran- 
ham, 1868-76; Rey. Dr. G. W. Johnson, 1876-78; R. A. Binford, 
187880; Misses Sue Young and Mary Thomas, 1880~81; Patrick H. 
Eager, A. M., 1881-87; Rey. J. D. Anderson, A. M., 188788, and Rev. 
Th. Smith, A. m., 1888—, Prof. Smith was for eight years professor of 
Latin in Georgetown College, Georgetown, Ky. 
The administration of President Smith has been energetic and pro- 
gressive. The attendance has grown rapidly, being 99, 136, and 187 for 
thelast three years,inorder. The most elementary instruction is given 
at the same time that calculus and Greek, astronomy, and Anglo-Saxon 
are taught. Itis the president’s ambition to put scholarship upon as 
firm a basis here as itis at any American female college. For mistress 
of arts, the highest degree of the institution, successful examinations 
must be passed in the schools of English, Latin, French, German, nat- 
ural science, mental and moral science, mathematics, history, political 
economy, and civics. Greek, calculus. Anglo-Saxon. and Spanish are 
offered as optional studies.

SOULE COLLEGE. 
Soule College was founded at Murfreesboro in 1852 by the Methodist 
Episcopal Church South and remained under its auspices until 1889. 
The presidents of the college during this time were Rev. D. D. Moore, 
Rey. J. B. West, D. D., and Rey. John R. Thompson, A.M. President 
Thompson bought the property of the school from the chureh confer- 
ence. In 1889 he sold it to J. G. Paty, the present owner. Mr. Paty 
is also secretary and treasurer of the college and professor of Greek. 
Dr. Z. C. Graves, the celebrated president of Mary Sharp College, 
resigned in 1889 and was secured for the presidency of Soule College. 
A number of his colleagues, having resigned at the same time, came 
with him to Murfreesboro. Prof. Paty was one of them. The new 
administration is succeeding. The enrollment of pupils last year was 
208. The college building has been enlarged, the faculty strengthened, 
and new apparatus procured. For the degree of B. A. either Latin or 
Greek is required and for M. A. both are necessary. 
The curriculum has been arranged to meet the imperative demands for a broader 
and deeper education for woman. All superficial training is deprecated as unworthy 
of the aims of earnest students. The main idea has been and shall be to teach the 
student to think. 
TENNESSEE FEMALE COLLEGE. 
Chartered in 1856 and opened in 1857, Tennessee Female College was 
the work chiefly of John Marshall, a gifted lawyer of Franklin. The 
school was placed under the patronage of the Tennessee annual con- 
ference of the Methodist Episcopal Church South. The ownership of the 
property was vested in a stock company. The first president was John 
M. Sharp and the second was a Mr. Callendar. With the fall of Fort 
Donelson, in February, 1862, the school was closed. After the battle of 
Franklin the college building was used as a hospital for wounded 
soldiers. From 1865 to 1868 the school was in the hands of one Cal- 
laghan. During this period the institution did not prosper. When 
the college was committed to the fostering care of the Tennessee an- 
nual conference it was encumbered with a debt of $6,000 or $7,000. 
By 1868 the debt had swelled to $10,000. For this sum the school 
was now sold to R. K. Hargrove, since become a bishop of the Metho- 
dist Episcopal Church South, who conducted it for five years. It was 
then bought by William J. Vaughn, for many years a professor in the 
University of Alabama, now a professor in Vanderbilt University. 
Dr. Vaughn was president of Tennessee Female College from 1873 to 
1878. In 1878 Dr. Hargrove repurchased the property and ran the 
school for two years. He and Vaughn raised the standard of the insti- 
tution above the level of the ordinary female school in Tennessee, but 
the uplift was owing to the individual impetus imparted by able presi- 
dents and not to permanent conditions. In 1880 Dr. Hargrove leased 
the school to Mrs. M. E, Clark. After his election to the bishopric, in  
-P-A-G-E-324
  
254 HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE. 
1882, he gave the property to his children. At the expiration of Mrs. 
Clark’s lease, in 1885, the property was purchased by Mr. Thomas 
Edgerton. In 1886 the college building was destroyed by fire. It was 
rebuilt by a stock company and Edgerton was continued as president. 
Very recently the school has been leased to Rev. Wibur F. Wilson, of 
Arkansas. 
ST. CECILIA ACADEMY. 
St. Cecilia Academy, Nashville, is another school of the Dominican 
Sisters. It was founded in 1860 by the Rt. Rev. J. Whealan and put 
in charge of Dominican Sisters from Ohio. In 1861 a charter was 
obtained. The school did not decline during the war, but continued in 
successful operation. It was at first under the patronage of its founder, 
later under that of the Rt. Rev. P. A. Feehan, and now under that of 
the Rt. Rey. J. Rademacher. The cugiculum comprises primary, inter- 
mediate, preparatory, and academic courses. The school numbers gen- 
erally about 100. St. Cecilia is beautifully situated, just north of the 
city limits, on an eminence overlooking the valley of the Cumberland. 
WARD’S SEMINARY. 
There is no better known female school in the South than Ward’s 
Seminary. :- Between 3,500 and 4,000 girls and young women have been 
educated within its walls and about 900 have received its diploma. 
The school was founded at Nashville in 1865 by Rev. William E. Ward, 
D. D., a graduate of Cumberland University, Lebanon, in the class of 
1851. The seminary was opened on the corner of Summer and Cedar 
streets, but in 1866 it was removed to its present site on Spruce street, 
between Church and Broad. The location is very central, being within 
easy distance of the depots, theaters, churches, and of the business 
quarter of the city. The cost of buildings and grounds has been 
$125,000. 
The seminary is four stories high above the basement and. contains 70 rooms, a 
large practice hall, a chapel 104 by 40 feet, well lighted and ventilated and hand- 
somely furnished with modern school furniture, and recitation, art, and music 
rooms. 5 
In 1887 Dr. Ward died and J. B. Hancock, A. M., a graduate of Cum- 
berland University, was elected principal. During Prof. Hancock’s 
administration the enrollment of the seminary reached perhaps the 
highest, point in its history, 346 in 1889-90, In the spring of 1891 
Ward’s Seminary was sold to the Presbyterian Codperative Association 
of Nashville. Heretofore the institution had been nondenominational. 
The new management appointed to the headship of the school Rev. B. 
H. Charles, D. D., a gentleman of fifteen years’ experience in conduct- 
ing girls’ schools. The seminary has at the present time eighteen 
instructors. It usually, also, has courses of lectures by one or more

WESLEYAN FEMALE COLLEGE. 
Wesleyan Female College, an institution under Methodist supervi- 
sion, was opened at Brownsville in 1867 and chartered in 1870. Its 
founder, Rey. John Williams, A. M., has been its president during nearly 
the whole of its history. Mr. Williams died in March, 1891, and in June 
Mr. T. W. Crowder was elested his successor. And now, after being 
elosed a year, the college will resume its work. The average attend- 
ance has been about 60 and the number of graduates more than 100. 
The property is worth $6,000. It is unproductive. 
MARTIN FEMALE COLLEGE. 
Martin Female College, Pulaski, Giles County, has a permanent | 
productive fund of $30,000, the only female school in Tennessee that 
ean boast of being endowed to any considerable amount. Thomas 
Martin, its founder, who died in 1870, was a public-spirited and philan- 
thropie citizen and one of the foremost men in the history of Giles 
County. His love for his fellow-citizens, among whom he had lived 
and accumulated his wealth, prompted him to found a school for their 
daughters. Accordingly, in his will he set apart $35,000 for that pur- 
pose, $30,000 in Tennessee 6 per cent bonds and $5,000 in cash. The 
interest on the bonds was to be paid, as it matured and was collected, 
to*the officers of the Methodist Episcopal Church South at Pulaski, to 
be appropriated by them for purchasing grounds and erecting build- 
ings for a female school, and after that was accomplished to be used in 
part payment of teachers in the school thus founded. Mr. Martin had 
been a prominent and zealous member of the Pulaski Church. The 
$5,000 were to be paid over to the trustees of the school, or, if no trus. 
tees were appointed, to the officers of the church to be expended for 
the use and benefit of the school. 
The officers of the church accepted the gift and intrusted its admin- 
istration wholly to a board of nine trustees, reserving the right to nom- 
inate to vacancies in the board and stipulating that vacancies should 
be filled out of such nominations. Tive of the trustees were Methodists, 
prominent officers of the Pulaski Church, and four were not. The 
president of the board, John C. Brown, Governor of Tennessee, was not 
aMethodist. With these trustees as corporators a charter was obtained 
for Martin Female College. The stipulation as to vacancies in the 
board of trustees was inserted in the charter, which embodied also a 
provision insuring to the trustees the exclusive control and manage- 
ment of the college and another commending the college to the foster-    
-P-A-G-E-326

ing care of the Tennessee annual conference of the Methodist Episco- 
cal Church South. 
The gift of Thomas Martin was supplemented by $15,000 subscribed 
by citizens of Giles County without regard to denomination. The school 
was formally organized and began its corporate existence in 1870, but 
did not complete its building till 1874. 
In 1887 litigation was instituted against the trustees and ieeeers of 
Martin Female College and against the officers of the Pulaski Methodist 
Church questioning the foundation of the college, asking for a new 
construction of the will and praying for the voidance of the charter. 
Although the school had been managed by a board of trustees appointed 
by the Methodist Church of Pulaski, the people of Pulaski and Giles 
County regarded it as unsectarian and as hardly denominational 
even. The principals of the school at this time were Misses Ida E. 
Hood and Susan L. Heron, the one a Friend, the other a Presbyterian. 
Their lease expired June 1, 1887, and strong objections were made to 
its renewal. It was asserted that in law Martin Female College was 
the property and was subject to the control of the Methodist Episcopal 
Church South, represented by the Tennessee annual conference. The 
will of Thomas Martin, it was claimed, contemplated such ownership 
and control. The suit was brought at the instigation of Rev. T. J. 
Duncan, presiding elder of the district in which Pulaski was located, 
and was approved and sanctioned by the Tennessee annual conference. 
The officers of the local church sided with the college, and considerable 
bitterness was engendered by the controversy. It was not finally 
settled until the supreme court had adjudicated upon it. The decision 
was in favor of the college, and against those who sought to alter the 
existing status. = 
During the pendency of this litigation Mrs. O. M. Spofford, daughter 
of Thomas Martin and sole residuary legatee under his will, filed an- 
other suit against the corporation, asking for a further construction of 
the will and alleging that only the interest upon the $30,000 of Tennes- 
see State bonds was intended to be given to the school, and that when 
the bonds matured they would revert to the estate and become her 
property as sole residuary legatee. This suit also went through the in- 
ferior and supreme courts and was decided in favor of the school. The 
$30,000 in bonds were decreed to the corporation as a perpetual endow- 
ment fund for the school, the interest only to be consumed and the 
principal to be kept inviolate. Soon afterwards these bonds were taken 
up by the State and in their stead non-negotiable certificates for a like 
amount were issued direct to the college corporation. The interest 
upon these at 6 per cent per annum is promptly paid every half year. 
The yearly interest of $1,800 and a nominal rental of $500 paid by the 
lessees constitute a fund which the trustees use in building up the col- 
lege property, making permanent additions and improvements. The 
real estate and furnishings are valued at $35,000. 
Misses Hood and Herén continued at the head of the school until the

expiration of their second lease in 1890, when they removed to Nash- 
ville and opened Belmont College. Their administration was a complete 
success. They were suceeeded by Rey. R. M. Saunders, at that time 
principal of East Mississippi Female College, Meridian, Miss. Mr. 
Saunders has had extensive experience as an educator, having taught 
at Norfolk, Va., and for several years in Germany. His wife is a most 
scholarly and cultured woman, speaks several modern languages, and 
teaches them with success. She is also an exceptional teacher of Eng- 
- lish and Anglo-Saxon. 
Martin College is doing good work. A noteworthy feature is the 
offering of post-graduate courses. Last year advanced work was done 
in the schools of mathematics and English. Prof. William M. Basker- 
vill, of Vanderbilt University, had supervision over the English course. 
A student completing this course receives a special diploma from the 
college countersigned by Prof. Baskervill. Special diplomas have also 
been granted in mathematics. John 8. Wilkes, an able attorney of 
Pulaski, is the successor of Gov. John C. Brown as president of the 
board of trustees of Martin Female College. The most cordial relations 
now exist between the school and the Tennessee annual conference. 
Mr. Saunders is a member of that body.

CLARA CONWAY INSTITUTE. 
Miss Clara Conway has been a long time prominent in teachers’ in- 
stitutes and in educational associations. In 1877 she left a position in 
the public schools of Memphis to open a high-grade school for girls. 
She began with 50 pupils, one assistant, and $300 of borrowed money. 
In 1884-85 a number of public-spirited citizens of Memphis came to 
her assistance, a stock company was organized, the school incorporated, 
and a building erected. Miss Conway proposed to call the school the 
Margaret Fuller School, but the trustees named it instead the Clara 
Conway Institute. From the small beginning of fourteen years ago 
the institute has grown until now its roll of pupils reaches 300 and its 
property is valued at $75,000. The “Home” for boarders is situated 
in a 3-acre grove 4 squares from the school building. The whole fourth 
floor is equipped for a gymnasium and is under the charge of a lady 
pupil of Dr. Sargent, of Harvard. Clara Conway Institute prepares 
for the women’s colleges—Vassar, Wellesley, etc.—but it does not 
boast of being a college itself.

THE HIGBEE SCHOOL, 
Miss Jenny M. Higbee was for ten years principal of the Memphis 
Public High School for girls and in that capacity did much to elevate 
the standard of the public-school system of Memphis. For three years 
she was in charge of a private school established by some clergymen 
of the Presbyterian and other churches. In 1879 she opened the Hig- 
bee School, a private non-sectarian school for girls of all ages and all 
stages of advancement. About the year 1883 some of the citizens of 
Memphis bought and remodeled the building, which had theretofore 
been rented, and in addition erected a new building for the use and 
benefit of the school in perpetuity. Although there is a stock company, 
“Miss Higbee is virtually the proprietor of the school and to her are 
referred all matters connected with its welfare.” 
‘The Higbee School can not be too highly commended in that it does 
not profess to be a college, but claims only to fit for college. Its cer- 
tificate admits to Vassar and Wellesley. Its “regular course” does 
somewhat more than prepare for college, and collegiate studies may be 
pursued if the pupil wishes it. Miss Higbee deprecates the limita- 
tion of the word “college,” and would hail the day when the highest 
male institutions in the State should open their doors to men and women 
alike. The Rebecca Higbee Scholarship, founded in 1888, secures to 
its beneficiary the income of $5,000. The holder may be a student of 
the Higbee School or may carry on studies at a higher institution. The 
holder for 1890~91 was a graduate of Miss Higbee’s and a student at 
Vassar. 
NASHVILLE COLLEGE FOR YOUNG LADIES. 
On Broad and Vauxhall streets in Nashville stand three large brick 
buildings covering a half acre of ground. The one immediately on the 
corner of Broad and Vauxhall is tall and massive. It is five stories 
high above the basement and extends 108 feet along Broad and 68 
along Vauxhall. Further back on Vauxhall stands another brick, four 
stories high, with a frontage of 100 and a depth of 140 feet. Between 
the two larger buildings is another four-story brick 110 by 50 feet. The 
first of these buildings is not yet completed; the second was erected 
in 1882, and the third in 1888. These commodious structures are the 
home of the Nashville College for Young Ladies, and represent better 
thananything else can the growth of the school from 104 pupils in 1881 
to413in 1891. The institution took rise in the desire of the Methodists 
of Nashville, the center of Southern Methodism, to see in Nashville a 
girls’ school of their own denomination. It was in response to this 
desire that Rev. George W. F. Price, Dp. D., of Alabama, opened on 
South Spruce street, in September,1880, the Nashville Collegé for Young 
Ladies, at his own expense, with the assurance that if it proved suc- 
cessful the means would be forthcoming for its enlargement. It did

succeed, the funds were raised, and a charter was obtained in Novem- 
ber, 1881. In November, 1882, the school was removed to its new 
quarters on Vauxhall street. 
Although it is a Methodist institution, “ Price’s School” is not under 
the control or care of any conference or number of conferences. There 
is, however, a charter restraint laid upon the election to vacancies in 
the board of trustees; such elections are subject to the confirmation of 
the board of trustees of Vanderbilt University. But that board appears 
never to have exercised its right. 
In the spring of 1889 Dr. Price was enabled by the addition of a new 
building to fit up the old chapel as a gymnasium for his own pupils and 
for the girls and ladies of the city who wished to attend. The work of 
the college is organized in a number of departments, viz: Kindergar- 
ten, primary, intermediate, academic, collegiate, modern languages, art, 
music, and post-graduate. A special comparative study is made of the 
literature of different languages. The library is small, but it is com- 
posed of valuable books of reference and is so classified as to facilitate 
their use. Dr. D. C. Kelley was instrumental in raising the funds for 
the inauguration of the Nashville College for Young Ladies on a larger 
scale, and he has always been the president of its board of trustees.

CENTENARY COLLEGE. 
Centenary College is owned and controlled by the Holston Confer- 
ence of the Methodist Episcopal Church South. The college site is a 
6-acre tract in the city of Cleveland, lower East Tennessee, laid off in 
walks and drives and adorned with lawns, fountains, trees, and statu- 
ary. The college buildings are of brick, trimmed with stone, and con- 
sist of a central building four storiesin heightand two wings three stories 
high, the whole presenting a front of 320 feet. Besides these there is 
a small two-story music hall in course of construction, in addition to 
various outbuildings. The property of the college is valued at $100,000 
and is free of debt. Centenary College is one of the offerings of Chris- 
tians of the Wesleyan faith on occasion of the centenary of organized 
Methodism in America, 1884, Rev. George R. Stuart was the prime 
mover in the enterprise. The erection of the buildings began in 1.84, 
and had progressed so far in 1885 as to admit of the opening of the col- 
lege. The faculty consisted of Rev. D. Sullins, A. M., D. D., president; 
Rey. George R. Stuart, A. M., professor of natural sciences and higher 
English; Rev. J. A. Stubblefield, A. m., professor of Latin and mathe- 
matics, and of six lady teachers. The attendance the first year was 
100; in 1890-91 it had reached 200. Thirteen teachers are now em-

ployed. Rev. Mr. Stuart, the leading spirit in the founding of Cente- 
nary College, is no longer in its faculty, but is the pastor of Centenary 
Church, Chattanooga. 
BELMONT COLLEGE. 
Belmont College, opened in the autumn of 1890, adds one more to 
Nashville’s many schools. Its founders were Miss Ida E. Hood and 
Miss Susan L. Heron, who were five years at the head of Martin Col- 
lege, Pulaski, Tenn. Misses Hood and Heron are the principals of the 
school and the owners of the property; and with the assistance of a 
business manager manage the affairs of the institution. Belmont Col- 
lege is in the country, yet it is only 2 or 3 miles from the heart of the 
city. The site is almost ideal—the ante-bellum residence of a wealthy 
Southern family, renewed and rebeautified by the hand of taste and 
skill, The extensive grounds, already beautiful by nature, have also 
received the touch of art. Near by is Roger Williams University, and 
a little farther off Vanderbilt University. Besidesa beautiful environ- 
ment Belmont College has a good equipment for educational work. It 
claims a well-filled library, a well-equipped gymnasium, and a splendid 
laboratory. The corps of teachers and the list of lecturers are large. 
Among the lecturers for 1890~91 were Maurice Thompson and a number 
of Vanderbilt professors, one of whom gave a course of twelve lectures. 
The patronage of Belmont promises to be large; at its first opening 
many applicants for admission were turned away for want of accommo- 
dations.

WORK OF AMERICAN MISSIONARY ASSOCIATION—FIRST SCHOOL AMONG THE 
NEGROES. 
The American Missionary Association of New York, a society sus- 
tained by the Congregational churches of the Northern States, was 
founded in 1846, It was this organization, conceived in no friendly 
spirit to the institution of slavery, that established the first school 
among the Negroes of the South. On September 17, 1861, five months 
after the Civil war began, it opened a school among the fugitive slaves 
that took refuge under the guns of Fort Monroe. The association, fol- 
lowing in the wake of the Union army, but not retreating when it dis- 
banded, pushed with vigor its work of evangelizing and educating the 
Negro race. In 1863 it had 83 ministers and teachers among the freed- 
men; in 1864, 250, and in 1868, 532. “During several years after the 
war it supported annually upwards of 500 missionaries and teachers 
in the South and numbered over 40,000 pupils in its schools.” By the 
year 1876 it had founded seven chartered colleges in as many different 
States, in addition to twenty-five normal and other schools. 
In August, 1865, Rev. E. M. Cravath and Rev. E. P. Smith, agents 
of the American Missionary Association, came to Nashville to open a 
school for the Negroes. They found that the noble J. G. McKee, “a 
man who could not live selfishly,” had already been teaching among 
them for two years. They found also Prof. John Ogden, representing 
the Western Freedmen’s Aid Commission. After many ineffectual 
attempts to secure a house for a school they came upon the “ Railroad 
Hospital,” a group of buildings lying west of the Chattanooga depot 
that had been used for hospital purposes by the Federal troops. These 
buildings could not be had without buying the land upon which 
they stood. Sixteen thousand dollars was the price asked. Neither 
the American Missionary Association nor the Western Freedmen’s Aid 
Commission had the funds to buy the land, and had not Cravath, Smith, 
and Ogden become individually responsible for the purchase money 
the project must have failed. They raised $4,000 in cash among them-

selves and a few others and gave their notes for the balance. After- 
wards the property and the school established there passed under the 
complete control of the American Missionary Association by its assump- 
tion of these notes and by its absorption of the Western Freedmen’s 
Aid Commission. 
All three men, Smith, Cravath, and Ogden, had been connected with 
the Union army,—Smith as secretary of the Christian Commission, 
Ogden as an officer, and Cravath as a chaplain. Ogden had been 
before the war a professor in the Minnesota State Normal School, and 
was therefore not without experience as a teacher. Cravath’s father 
was an abolitionist and he himself had been educated at antislavery 
Oberlin. 
OPENING OF THE FISK, 
Gen. Clinton B. Fisk, the head of the Freedmen’s Bureau for Ken- 
tucky and Tennessee, took such an active interest in the projected 
school and did so much for it that it was named in his honor. Fisk 
School was opened January 9, 1866, with Prof. John Ogden as principal. 
So eager were the Negroes to learn that for two years the attendance 
numbered upwards of 1,200. For a year or two the instruction given 
was very elementary. But in 1867 the establishment in Nashville of 
public schools for colored children relieved the Fisk School of much of 
this kind of work. The progress made by its pupils was creating a 
demand for higher education. The Fisk was in duty bound to meet 
this demand, for it had been the avowed purpose of its founders to 
furnish educational advantages of as high a character as the Negro 
should show himself capable of using. They ever kept before them 
the ideal of an institution of learning of the highest class, where 
the teachers and leaders of an emancipated race should be trained. 
For these reasons Fisk University was chartered on August 22, 1867, 
with George Whipple, E, M. Cravath, Charles Crosby, John Ogden, 
Joseph H. Barnum, W. W. Mallory, John Lawrence, John Ruhm, and 
J.J. Cary as trustees. 
A donation of $7,000 from the Freedmen’s Bureau, supplemented by 
funds of the American Missionary Association, enabled the trustees to 
repair the buildings and to erect a chapel and a dormitory and have 
them ready for use by 1869, An annual appropriation of $800 from the 
Peabody fund afforded aid to indigent students. The previous expe- 
rience of Prof. Ogden as a normal teacher fitted him for the normal 
work that was now undertaken. 
TEACHERS GO OUT FROM FISK. 
Teachers for the colored schools began to go out from Fisk as early 
as 1868, and in a few years they were scattered all over the South, 
teaching thousands of children in the Sabbath and day schools. 
Tn 1868 a church was organized for the benefit of the faculty and stu-

dents, with Prof. H. S. Bennett as pastor. The school had from 
the first a decidedly religious tone. Indeed, “the conversion of new 
students was confidently looked for and more earnestly sought than 
their progress in letters.” 
A. K. SPENCE BECOMES PRESIDENT. 
In 1870 Prof. A. K. Spence sueceeded Prof. Ogden as principal of the 
the school. The views of Prof. Ogden and the American Missionary 
Association were not in harmony. Being a normal school man, Ogden 
wished to see Fisk continue merely a normal school and did not sym- 
pathize with the purpose of ultimately developing it into a college. 
The first college classes were organized in 1871; in 1875 two young 
men and two young women graduated with the degree of bachelor of 
arts. 
The old buildings in which the Fisk was quartered were unsuited to 
school purposes; besides they were falling into decay. The American 
Missionary Assotiation was not able to put up new buildings. Yet 
new buildings had to be put up or the school had to sacrifice its hopes 
of future growth and expansion. The need had become a crying one. 
Who was to meet it? 
7 THE JUBILEE SINGERS. 
George L. White fought in the Civil War as an officer on the staff of 
Gen. Clinton B. Fisk. After the war he filled a clerk’s position in the 
Freedmen’s Bureau, still under Gen. Fisk. During the early days of 
the Fisk School he became instructor in vocal music. Besides this, he 
soon made himself indispensable as treasurer of the school and general 
business man. His ability in training voices proved remarkable—so 
much so that he ventured on giving several public concerts in Nash- 
ville, Memphis, and Chattanooga, which were very successful. He it 
was who came to the rescue at this emergency in the history of the uni- 
versity. “He conceived the idea of coining the slave melodies of the 
old plantation and the campmeeting into gold and silver.” ‘The diffi- 
culties were many, but a few friends had faith in the plan. Mr. White 
applied to Gen. Fisk, then living in St. Louis, for a loan of $300 with 
which to take his singers north of the Ohio River. The general dis- 
countenanced the foolhardy scheme and told Mr. White “to stay at 
home and do his work.” To this Mr. White replied that he “trusted in 
God and not in Gen. Fisk.” “Taking the little money that was left in 
the university treasury, after buying provisions to last the school a few 
days, putting with it all his own, and borrowing on his own notes an 
amount whose payment, if the venture was a failure, would strip him 
of every penny of his property, he started out with barely enough money 
to set his party in working order on the northern side of the Ohio 
River.” The troupe left Nashville October 6, 1871, and went first to 
Cincinnati. After singing there and in several Ohio towns it went to  
-P-A-G-E-340
264 HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE. 
New York and the New England States. At times it seemed that the 
undertaking would have to be abandoned, for it was not even paying 
its way. As yet the company had no name. At last Mr. White hit 
upon one that might be called the salvation of the enterprise, the 
“Jubilee Singers.” The tide soon turned. Crowds came to hear these 
poor ex-slaves sing the songs they had sung in their bondage. These 
songs were unique. Northern audiences had never heard anything like 
them before. The musical critics were compelled to acknowledge that 
they possessed something of genuine melody. Regarding their origin 
and composition it has been said: “They are never composed after the 
manner of ordinary music, but spring into life ready-made from the 
white heat of religious fervor during-some protracted meeting in church 
orcamp. They come from no musical cultivation whatever, but are the 
simple, ecstatic utterances of wholly untutored minds.” Of the twenty- 
four men and women who, at one time or another, belonged to the 
Jubilee Singers, twenty had been slaves and three were of slave 
parentage. 
By May, 1872, the Jubilee Singers had netted $20,000. The next sea- 
son was equally successful. In the spring of 1874 they went to Eng- 
land. There the treatment accorded them by the Queen and many of 
the most prominent people of the kingdom, including Prime Minister 
Gladstone, at once opened the way to success. As the result of this 
tour of the United Kingdom, $50,000 were added to the $40,000 already 
made in America. The total was swelled to $100,000 by gifts of appa- 
ratus, books, furniture, ete. 
JUBILEE HALL. 
As soon as the success of the Jubilee Singers was assured, measures 
were taken to erect new buildings and enlarge the facilities of the uni- 
versity. Twenty-five acres of land were bought on Fort Gillem, one mile 
northwest of the capitol. The site is slightly elevated, conducing to 
good health and affording a fine view of Nashville and the adjacent 
country. Ground was broken for the new building January 1, 1873; 
the corner stone was laid October 1, 1873; and by January 1, 1876, 
“Jubilee Hall” was ready for dedication. Jubilee Hall is a beautiful 
building. It is in the form of an L, having an east front of 145 feet, 
and a south front of 128 feet; is built of pressed brick in modern Eng- 
lish style; is five stories in height, including basement; contains 120 
rooms; and is heated by steam, and supplied with gas and water. 
On the 1st of January, 1876, just as the nation was entering on its 
centennial year, Jubilee Hall was dedicated to the cause of religion 
and education. Never before was dedicated such a house as this, a 
house which is the songs of a race transmuted into an agency for the 
uplifting of the race. This thought was beautifully expressed by one 
of the speakers: 
Some one has said that ‘architecture is frozen music.” The music of the Jubilee 
Singers has rolled over this land and swept across the ocean, moving the hearts and
-P-A-G-E-341

calling forth the tears of vast multitudes, and it is now by a magic touch consoli- 
dated into this substantial and beautiful building. 
Above the platform were draped in loving embrace the flags of Eng- 
land and America, significant of the part that each had contributed to 
this day’s rejoicing. A large number of whites were present, many of 
them prominent in public and private life. Several addresses were 
made. Two of them were noteworthy as expressive of the attitude of 
the Southern people towards Negro education. Gen. Fisk, president of 
the board of trustees, said that the first considerable sum of money put 
into his hands for the education of the colored race was given him by 
a Southern man, Dr. A. L. P. Green. Commenting on this statement 
of Gen. Fisk, Dr. John B. McFerrin, senior secretary of the missionary 
society of the Methodist Episcopal Church South, used these words: 
I want you, Gen. Fisk, and all others to understand that the Southern people, as 
far as my information extends—that is, the intelligent, patriotic, and Christian peo- 
ple of the South with, perhaps, a few exceptions—rejoice in the education and eleva- 
tion of the colored people and fully appreciate the grand work you are doing for 
them. I stand on my native soil and bear this testimony. It meets the hearty codp- 
eration and sincere approbation of all Christian people. 
E, M. CRAVATH BECOMES PRESIDENT. 
Prior to 1875 the American Missionary Association had planned the 
work and shaped the policy of Fisk University and no one had been 
given the powers of a president. But in this year Dr. E. M. Cravath, 
who had, perhaps, played the leading réle in the founding of the uni- 
versity, was elected president. As field secretary of the association he 
had given the school the benefit of his zeal in its cause and his interest 
in its welfare. Now he assumed entire control of its affairs and became 
responsible for its success. 
When Jubilee Hall was dedicated the Jubilee Singers were in Eng- 
land, whither they had gone in March, 1875. President Cravath was 
with them. From England the company made trips to Switzerland, 
Holland, and Germany. In 1878 they disbanded after singing almost 
continuously for seven years. Something over $150,000 had been the 
reward of their labors. 
LIVINGSTONE HALL. 
It was not long before the growing needs of Fisk University de- 
manded larger accommodations. Jubilee Hall would no longer suffice. 
The idea of building Livingstone Missionary Hall originated with the 
Jubilee Singers while in England in 1876. Several thousand dollars for 
the purpose were raised in Europe, but it was to the gift of $60,000 from 
an American lady, Mrs. Valeria G. Stone, of Malden, Mass., that the 
erection of Livingstone Hall was mainly due. Though ground was first 
broken 1n 1877, it was not until the session of 1882~’83 that the build- 
- ing was completed and ready for use. 
Livingstone Hall is a large five-story brick building hardly less impos-

ing than Jubilee Hall. The latter is no longer the boarding department ~ 
of both sexes, but is reserved for the use of the girls and young women. 
Its dining hall, however, is still the dining hall for both sexes. Besides 
122 rooms for young men, Livingstone Hall contains the chapel, museum, 
class rooms, library, and university printing office. 
DEPARTMENTS AND COURSES. 
The school advantages enjoyed by colored children are not so numer- 
ous or excellent as to enable them to dispense with any schools that 
may have been established for their benefit. Accordingly, while Fisk 
University has fulfilled its pledge of furnishing the means of a higher 
education, it has not cut off the lower departments, but still gives 
instruction of the most elementary kind. The common English depart- 
ment, as it is called, is divided into classes A, B, C, and D, and offers 
a course embracing the common English branches. The model school, 
as its name indicates, serves as a school of observation and experiment 
for normal students. In it are taught pupils not able to enter the com- 
mon English department. From the common English department stu- 
dents pass into the normal department or into the college preparatory 
department. The normal department comprises an elementary and an 
advanced course, each covering two years, called respectively the first 
and the second year and the junior and the senior year. The college 
preparatory department is divided into three years: the junior, middle, 
and senior. Above it is the college proper, with its four years’ course. 
As would be expected of an institution that gave to the world the 
Jubilee Singers, Fisk University has not suffered the undoubted musical 
genius of the Negro race to go uncultivated. There are four teachers 
of instrumental and vocal music, three of whom devote their whole time 
to musical instruction. The Mozart Musical Society has been “ organ- 
ized for the purpose of studying and from time to time rendering in 
public standard musical compositions of the most advanced character, 
including oratorios.” 
PHYSICAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
Mental, moral, and religious culture has been the chief aim of the 
Fisk, but manual training and physical development have not been 
neglected. A brick building has lately been erected, the lower floor of 
which is used for gymnastic purposes, the upper floor as a workshop; 
and a three years’ course in normal training, including working in 
wood, drawing, etc., has been arranged. The trustees are assisted in 
the work by the John F. Slater and the Daniel Hand funds. <A print- 
ing office has been furnished by a special appropriation from the Slater 
fund, and a number of young men and women are annually taught the 
art of printing. Instruction is given the young women in sewing, cook- 
ing, nursing, and hygiene. Every boarder, male or female, is required 
to work one hour a day for the university. The authorities try to im-

pue the students with practical, healthy views of life, and to make man- 
ual labor dignified and not degrading. 
In the character and comprehensiveness of its literary and scientific 
instruction Fisk University stands far above any other colored school. 
Deeming college education proper as the only true basis for profes- 
sional education, the university has directed its energies to building up 
the college department; but it is the intention of the authorities to 
open professional schools as soon as possible. A building for a theo- 
logical seminary is nearing completion, and it is expected that regular 
instruction will begin with the year 1891~92. Theological instruction 
has been given ever since 1869, but there has never been a regular 
organized department with students pursuing exclusively theological 
studies. 
STATE AND STATE NORMAL STUDENTS, 
In the catalogues of Fisk University will be found a class of stu- 
dents called “State” students and a class called “State normal” 
students. The former are appointed by senators and representatives 
on State scholarships, which entitle the holders to free tuition in the 
State University. By arrangement with the university negroes receiv- 
ing State scholarships are educated at the Fisk and at Knoxville Col- 
lege, their tuition being paid by the university.! The “State normal” 
students are students appointed by State senators, under an act of the 
Tennessee legislature, making an annual appropriation of $3,300 for the 
education of colored teachers. Each of the 33 senators has the right 
to appoint two students to a $50 scholarship; appointments being 
based on competitive examination. An appointee may attend any 
school approved by the State board of education. The schools so 
approved are Roger Williams University, Fisk University, Central 
Tennessee College, Knoxville College, Le Moyne Institute, and Morris- 
town Normal Institute. 
ATTENDANCE—GRADUATES, 
The enrollment of students has been steadily increasing of late years. 
In 1889-90 it was 523, and represented Jamaica and nineteen States of 
the Union. Forty-nine of these students were members of the regular 
college classes, 59 belonged to the college preparatory department, and 
67 to the normal department. There have been in all 104 graduates 
from the college department. Many of them have since graduation 
been admitted to the master’s degree. Heretofore this degree has been 
conferred on baccalaureate graduates of three years’ standing who 
have been engaged in some intellectual pursuit or who have been prose- 
cuting professional studies. Hereafter no one will be admitted to the

FACULTY. 
The faculty of the college department is as follows: . 
E, M. Cravath, D. D., professor of mental and moral science and politi- 
cal economy. 
Adam K, Spence, M. A., professor of Greek and French. 
Henry S. Bennett, M. A., professor of theology and Germa:, 
Frederick A. Chase, M. A., professor of natural science. 
Helen C. Morgan, M. A., professor of Latin. 
Herbert H. Wright. M. A., professor of mathematics. 
Some of the professors are charged with other duties in addition to 
teaching the subjects mentioned, Besidesthese members of the college 
faculty proper, there are twenty-three other instructors and officers. 
FINANCIAL. 
In order that Fisk University may build aright on the broad founda- 
tions that have been laid a large endowment is almost absolutely neces- 
sary. Its property is worth $350,000, but none or little of itis produce- 
tive. The running expenses of the university are paid principally by 
the American Missionary Association. One thousand eight hundred 
dollars to $2,000 are annually received from the John F. Slater fund 
and expended chiefly in industrial training. 
Last year $2,500 were appropriated from the Daniel Hand fund for 
the assistance of poor students. Six scholarships of $1,000 each have 
been established, also for the assistance of poor students. 
The great majority of Fisk students are very poor and have to pay 
their way as they go. Many, if not most of them, teach school during 
apart of the year. The loss of time from college on this account of 
course lowers the standard of scholarship. As a general rule the 
graduates of Fisk become teachers. Most of them prosper and lay up 
money. Indeed, the accumulation of wealth seems to be a chief object 
of those Negroes who have received a collegiate education. As the 
possession of property is conducive to good citizenship, this endeavor 
to better their material condition is a hopeful sign for the future of the 
race, 
EVANGELIZATION OF AFRICA. 
The name Livingstone Missionary Hall is but the expression of the 
hope which many have cherished that Fisk University would become a 
power for the evangelization of Africa. As yet that hope has met with 
little encouragement. Eight students have gone as missionaries to 
Africa, but only three are there at the present time. It is hardly to be 
expected that a race just emerging from the darkness of bondage, with

with an inspiration to carry the light of religicn and education to its

CENTRAL TENNESSEE COLLEGE 
FOUNDING. 
Central Tennessee College is a school for Negroes supported by the 
Freedmens’ Aid and Southern Education Society of the Methodist 
Episcopal Church. The estimated value of its grounds and buildings 
is $125,000. In 1865 Bishop D. W. Clark, to whom the missionary 
society of the church had intrusted $10,000 for the establishment of a 
school for freedmen, authorized Rev. John Seys to open a school in 
Nashville. The school was opened in Andrew Chapel, thereafter known 
as Clark Chapel, on Chestnut street between Cherry and College streets, 
in south Nashville. The principal was Rev. O. O. Knight; his-assistants 
Mrs. Julia North, Mrs. Mary Murphy, and Miss O. D. Barben, were all 
colored. 
The school was composed of scholars of all ages and sizes, grandparents and 
grandchildren, parents and children, were all in the same classes. They were poorly 
clad and mostly homeless wanderers from the plantations. They found shelter in the 
army barracks, in abandoned houses, in cellars or garrets, stables, or other outhouses, 
whatever would afford them a present shelter. Yet in the midst of this destitution 
they were hungry for education. Never did teachers have more earnest pupils. 
The school grew so rapidly as to necessitate more room. The use of 
the old gun factory on South College street held by the Government 
as abandoned property was obtained, and the building fitted up for 
school purposes at an expense of $2,000. Hither the school was 
moved in the fall of 1866. Rev. C. B. Crichlow was principal for the 
session of 1866-67. He had eight. or ten assistants. They were all 
needed, for children flocked to the school to the number of about 800. 
The next year the attendance fell to 225. The causes of this were the 
imposition of a tuition fee of $1 per month and the opening of city 
schools for colored children. Since the great object of. the mission 
school was the education of teachers and preachers, it was thought 
best to allow the public schools to do as much of the elementary work 
as they would. : 
Rev. John Braden, A. M., was principal of the school during the 
year 1867-68. On May 24, 1866, the school was incorporated as the

Central Tennessee College, the corporators being William G. Brownlow, 
Thomas H. Pearne, W. J. Smith, T. BR. Starley, John Seys, William 
Bosson, Joseph 8. Carels, A. A. Gee, James R. Ferriss, Thomas H. 
Caldwell, R. G. Jamison, G. Ogden, and Daniel J. Holmes. The charter 
stipulated that two-thirds of the trustees should at all times be members 
of the Methodist Episcopal church. Another charter stipulation was 
that the board of trustees should always maintain a biblical depart- 
ment. The Freedmen’s Aid Society was organized this year and took 
the school under its care. A lot was bought in south Nashville near 
the medical college, but so much opposition to a Negro school was 
aroused in the neighborhood that the chancery court annulled the 
purchase. Attempts to buy property in Franklin, Murfreesboro, and 
Gallatin, met with like opposition. Finally, a piece of property on 
Maple street just south of La Fayette was secured. The only building 
was a large brick residence. Into this the school was moved late in 
the fall of 1868. Rev. G. H. Hartupee was in charge this year. In the 
winter and spring of 1869 the Freedmen’s Bureau contributed $15,000, 
and two brick buildings, one containing chapel and dormitories, the 
other school rooms and dormitories, were erected. 
Rev. Mr. Braden was reélected president in 1869 and has since unin- 
terruptedly held the position. The first catalogue was the one issued 
for the year 1869~70. It showed an attendance of 192. Each succes- 
sive catalogue, with very few exceptions, has shown a steady and grad- 
ual inerease until, in 1890-91, the total of 613 for all departments was 
reached. 
In 1872 the buildings would no longer accommodate the students, 
and a band of them known as the “Tennesseeans” went on a singing 
tour through the North. So successful were they that $18,000 were 
raised toward the erection of a new building. 
When the school began its work in 1865, and, indeed, for some time 
afterwards, the most elementary knowledge was all that was taught, 
The reason was not far to seek. In the presence of the alphabet the 
oldest Negro became a child. But much of the primary instruction was 
relegated to the public schools. The Negro progressed rapidly, Tre 
long he began to crave something beyond the mere rudiments of knowl- 
edge, and classes were formed in advanced mathematics, in Latin, 
Greek, belles-lettres, and natural sciences. The first one to complete 
the college course and receive a degree was Miss Araminta P. Martin, 
in 1878. 
NORMAL AND THEOLOGICAL DEPARTMENTS ORGANIZED. 
As has been said, the primary object of Central Tennessee College 
was the training of teachers and preachers. It was not long, there- 
fore, before normal and theological departments were organized. In 
the early days of the school so great was the demand for teachers and 
preachers that students were taken from their studies before they had

made searcely any advancement. An ability to readin words of one or 
two syllables and a fair knowledge of the elementary principles of arith- 
metic were considered qualifications enough. Of course that time has 
passed, but even now relatively few students complete a course of study. 
Hither poverty forces them into the strnggle for a livelihood or the 
knowledge they have already acquired opens to them opportunities 
more alluring than a longer stay within college walls. A crying need 
with the Negro race is thinkers and leaders of undoubted intelligence 
and high character. Central Tennessee College holds it to be its chief 
function to supply this need as far as in it lies. No other school for 
tho freedmen has essayed to cover so wide a field. No branch of hu- 
man knowledge, whether professional or nonprofessional, is deemed 
foreign to its mission, provided only there is a demand for that kind of 
knowledge. The colored man must be fitted for every vocation in life 
that he may wish to enter. Hence departments of law, medicine, den- 
tistry, pharmacy, and mechanics have been created, but no department 
has been created until there was an unmistakable demand forit. This 
principle has dominated the policy of the school throughout its whole 
history. 
GRADUATES’ COURSES. 
There have been 23 graduates of the college proper. Most of them 
have entered the pulpit or the teacher’s desk. Two have been pro- 
fessors of mathematics in colleges and three have been principals of 
conference seminaries. The college preparatory course covers three 
years, There is a regular theological course of two years in addition 
to a pastors’ course of five years for the benefit of pastors and others 
who can not attend school regularly. The normal course extends over 
three years. Among its studies is “methods of instruction;” this in 
addition to practical drill in teaching in the model school. The college 
has a number of “State normal” students, There were nine of them 
in 1890-91. The English course, five years in length, includes the 
studies considered essential to a common English education. Below 
the English course, and lowest of all, is the model school, where are 
taught the elements of an education. Only a limited number is ad- 
mitted. Quite different is it from the time when no pupils had ad- 
vanced beyond these lowest classes. 
THE MEHARRY MEDICAL, DENTAL, AND PHARMACEUTICAL DEPARTMENTS. 
As prolific a race as is the Negro of the Southern States, the last eon- 
sus shows that he is increasing at a much slower rate than the white 
man. The conclusion is that his mortality must be very great. This 
is due to three causes—poverty, ignorance, and lack of proper nursing 
and medical attention. For the six and a quarter millions of Negroes 
in the twelve Southern States south of the Ohio and the Potomac there 
are only 175 properly qualified physicians of their own race, and con-
-P-A-G-E-356

siderably more than half of these are graduates of one school, the Meharry 
medical department of Central Tennessee College. Prior to 1876 there 
was no medical school in the South for the colored race, if the medical 
department of Howard University at Washington be excepted. In 1876 
the Meharry Medical College was organized. Since then there have 
been established the Leonard Medical School of Shaw University, 
Raleigh, N. C., the Louisville National Medical College, and thé medical 
department of New Orleans University. The Meharry Medical College 
owes its name to the Meharry family, descendants of Alexander and 
Jane Meharry, Scotch-Irish immigrants of the year 1794. By them, 
with some aid from Dr. R. 8. Rust, the school was originally founded, 
and in them it has always found liberal contributors to its support. 
The main building was constructed in 1879. Itis built of brick and 
is 40 feet wide, 60 feet long, and four stories in height, including the 
basement. An additional building has been erected for practical dem- 
onstrations in anatomy. Seven professors, one assistant professor, one 
lecturer, three instructors, and a demonstrator of anatomy make up the 
corps of instruction. Dr. G. W. Hubbard has been dean and professor 
of chemistry, materia medica, and therapeutics ever since the organi- 
zation of the school in 1876. Dr. Hubbard is also dean and professor 
in the departments of dentistry and pharmacy and professor in the col- 
legiate department. The medical course covers three sessions of twenty 
weeks each. Applicants for admission as students must be 18 years 
old and must pass a satisfactory examination in arithmetic, geography, 
grammar, reading, writing, spelling, and elementary physics. Candi- 
dates for graduation must be 21 years of age and must have attended 
a regular medical school for at least three sessions of twenty weeks each, 
the last of which must have been at the Meharry. Students enjoy the 
clinical privileges of the city hospital on the same terms as the students 
of other medical schools in Nashville. 
Eighty young men attended the Meharry Medical College in 1890~91. 
One hundred and thirty-two have graduated from the institution, of 
whom 121 are still living. Of these all but 20 are practicing physi- 
cians. Eighteen of them have received a collegiate as well as a medi- 
cal education. They are almost universally respected by the white 
physicians, who assist them by loans of books and apparatus and 
often consult with them. Many of them are accumulating property 
and taking their places as conservative, self-respecting members of the 
community. The capacity of the colored man ably and honorably to 
fill the profession is being demonstrated beyond cavil. Z 
Correlated with the Meharry medical department are the Meharry 
dental and pharmaceutical departments. The former was organized in 
1886, the latter in 1889. In 1889 the Meharry dental and pharmaceuti- 
cal hall was built as a home for the new departments. The school of 
dentistry is greatly indebted to Dr. W. H. Morgan, dean of the dental 
department of Vanderbilt University, for “valuable counsel, timely
-P-A-G-E-357
    
CENTRAL TENNESSEE COLLEGE. 273 
assistance, and hearty sympathy.” The school has the indorsement of 
the Southern Dental Association, is a member of the Association of 
Dental Faculties, and its diploma receives due recognition wherever 
presented. The dental course covers three sessions of twenty weeks 
each, and the pharmaceutical course two sessions of twenty weeks each. 
There have been 14 dental and 4 pharmaceutical graduates. There is 
an even greater demand for colored dentists and pharmacists than for 
colored doctors, so that there is little trouble in finding lucrative em- 
ployment. During the past eight years the medical, dental, and 
pharmaceutical schools of Central Tennessee College have received 
$7,400 from the Slater fund. About one-fourth of this has been used 
in helping needy students, one-fourth in purchasing books and appa- 
ratus, and the remainder in paying the salaries of instructors. 
LAW DEPARTMENT. 
The law department of Central Tennessee College is the first and 
only law school for Negroes in the Southern States. The beginning of 
the school was in 1879, when Hon. John Lawrence, of Nashville, essayed 
to give instruction in law, asking in return only the pittance derived 
from tuition fees. His first graduate was Joseph H. Dismukes, now 
professor of common law in his alma mater. Besides Dismukes there 
are three other professors. Judge Lawrence died in 1889. There have 
been 16 graduates, some of whom have found other occupations more 
remunerative than the law. 
MANUAL TRAINING AND INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION. 
In no other industrial school has the Slater appropriation ($1,100 to 
$1,300 per year) been expended with better results than in that of 
Central Tennessee College. Beginning with a small carpenter’s shop 
in 1883, a comprehensive scheme of manual training has been devel- 
oped embracing instruction in printing, carpentry, blacksmithing, tin- 
work, wagon making, shorthand, typewriting, cooking, nursing, sew- 
ing, dressmaking, millinery, etc. As soon as a pupil is sufficiently 
advanced to make saleable articles he is paid for them. Thus the 
scheme contemplates as one of its aims, though not its chief one, the 
giving of aid to poor students. 
Central Tennessee College made the crowning move in industrial 
education in the summer and autumn of 1890, when a machine shop 
was built and equipped with a mechanical engineering outfit. 
The building is a one-story frame built in machine-shop style. It is well lighted 
with a cupola and its dimensions are 96 by 48 with 16-foot joists, and is painted 
well inside and outside. The expense of the building was about $2,500, $1,500 of 
which has already been paid by the citizens of Nashville. The building is supplied 
with work-benches, tool-room, office, etc., and is heated with steam and ventilated. 
by swinging windows in the cupola above. The building was planned by and the 
school is in charge of Prof. H. G. Sedgwick, an accomplished mechanician. The 
machinery, with material on hand, is worth $20,000, and consists of a thirty-five

274 HIGHER EDUCATION IN TENNESSEE. 
horse-power Armington and Simms engine, three lines of shafting 90 feet long, 
thirty-three pieces of machinery ranging from the large Garvin No. 3 universal 
milling machine down to the most minute gear cutters, together with lathes, planers, 
shapers, tryers, forges, spinning tools, sand blast, pipe-threaders, and bench tools 
of every variety. 
This equipment of machinery Prof. Sedgwick brought with him from 
Griswold College, Iowa, where he had charge of a department similar 
to the one he has established in Central Tennessee College. An expert 
mechanician and at the same time a Methodist preacher, Prof. Sedg- 
wick has devoted his property and his talents to the mechanical edu- 
eation of Negro youth—a noble work, surely. That he is sanguine of 
suecess can not be doubted. Says he: 
Come to Nashville and we will show you Negroes who can cut a gear, graduate a 
scale, make a service plate, or build an engine as well as the fair-haired boy from 
New England. The demand for his work will grow faster than we can prepare for 
it. We have already had over a score of applications for men that we can recom- 
mend for engineers, machinists, etc. 
The fact that tower clocks and telescopes are built in these shops 
attests the superior skill and methods of Prof. Sedgwick. Recently, 
while exhibiting specimens of hand work in steel done by Prof. Sedg- 
wick’s pupils—Negro boys from 16 to 20 years old—Dr. Hartzell, cor- 
responding secretary of the Freedmen’s Aid and Southern Education 
Society, remarked: “That does more to solve the negro problem than 
all the speeches made in Congress since the war.”

KNOXVILLE COLLEGE. 
FOUNDING, ETC, 
Like most other colored schools, Knoxville College traces its begin- 
ning to the troublous times of the Civil war. In September, 1862, 
under the auspices of three presbyteries of the United Presbyterian 
Church, Rey. J. G. McKee opened a school among the homeless, friend- 
less Negroes who flocked into Nashville. Mr. McKee had graduated 
at Westminster College, and had studied theology at Xenia, Ohio. He 
was a pioneer in the cause of Negro education. Possessed of much tact, 
devotion, and courage, his labors were successful, despite innumerable 
difficulties. His school grew and prospered until his death in 1868, 
The United Presbyterian Churcia had other schools in the South besides

the one at Nashville. It now resolved to concentrate its efforts on one 
school and to modify and elevate the character of that school by intro- 
ducing the normal feature. 
In June, 1869, the general assembly of the church recommended its 
board of missions to the freedmen to proceed as soon as possible to the 
establishment of a normal school somewhere in the South and author- 
ized it to draw upon the church for the funds necessary for the purpose. 
But the project lagged. The school at Nashville was abandoned or 
surrendered to others for a year and then resumed with flagging 
interest. 
In 1874 Knoxville was selected as the location which promised the 
best results. The Nashville school was removed thither in September, 
1875, and opened in an old building that had been occupied by a freed- 
men’s school. Meanwhile a new building was being erected. Into 
this the school was moved September, 1876. Although the normal 
idea was not abandoned, the school was known henceforth as Knox- 
ville College. Not that the name comported with the reality, “for 
there was not a student that could pass a good examination in arith- 
metic, grammar, or geography,” but its realization was set up as a 
goal toward which all endeavor should tend. The institution has 
hardly yet attained to the stature of a genuine college, but it has 
organized college classes and has graduated some 20 young men and 
women. Rey. J. 8. McCulloch, D. D., has been president and Miss 
Eliza B. Wallace, B.s., lady principal for thirteen years. Other buildings 
than the main building erected in 1876 have from time to time been 
constructed as the needs of the school required. A special feature are 
the homes for boys and girls. The Little Girls’ Home was built in 
1887 and the Little Boys’ Home in 1890, Children from 6 to 13, whether 
orphans or not, are received into these homes and-are cared for and 
taught by a matron, who endeavors to train hand, mind, and heart. 
In 1890/91 Knoxville College had an enrollment of 313, much the 
larger portion being in the lower classes, Ten of them were “State 
normal” students. The property of the school, including 224 acres of 
land, is valued at $100,000. Its chief support is contributions received 
through the board of missions to the freedmen, amounting to about 
$7,000 annually. 
INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION. 
Manual labor and industrial training are prominent features of Knox- 
ville College. Sewing and printing are taught and all of the work in 
and about the college, including the cultivation of the 16-acre farm, is 
done by students. Recently Knoxville College was made, virtually, 
the colored department of the University of Tennessee. The following 
statement explaining the relations between the college and the univer- 
sity was furnished by Dr. Charles W. Dabney, jr., president of the 
University of Tennessee. It would appear that President Dabney, is
-P-A-G-E-364

not well informed as to industrial education in the other colored schools 
of the State or else underestimates it. 
COLORED DEPARTMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE. 
An article of the State constitution requires that the colored race shall have a 
fair share of all the benefits of all funds provided for public education, ‘but the 
accommodation and instruction of persons of color shall be separate from the white.” 
The spirit of all the United States statutes pertaining to the land grant is the same. 
The Negro must have his share of the benefits of these grants, as far as he may be 
qualified to avail himself of them. The last grant (Morrill act, 1890), which pro- 
vided additional funds especially for industrial training and for instruction in Eng- 
lish, ete., is very explicit in its provisions for the Negro. 
From the time it received the benefits of the original land grant the University of 
Tennessee has done all it could to aid those colored men who had qualified them- 
selves to take a college course. 
For along time the only place in the State where college education was provided 
for them was at Fisk University. The land-grant act forbade any portion of the 
principal or interest of thatfund from being used for the purchase of land or the 
erection of buildings. The university had no money to purchase a site or erect a 
building for a separate colored department, and the State gave it nothing it could 
use for this purpose or any other; it has never given the university anything from 
its own treasury. 
Under these circumstances the only thing that could be done was to adopt some 
existing institution and pay the tuition of the colored appointees attending there. 
The board had the precedent for this in many other Southern States, as, for ex- 
ample, in Virginia at the Hampton Institute and also in the arrangement which the 
State made with them. 
Not wishing to expend any money in lands or buildings, the general assembly of 
1869 adopted the East Tennessee College for its land-grant institution, enteririg into 
a contract, under which East Tennessee College bound itself to provide the land 
for the site and for the agricultural experimental farm and the fund for extensive 
buildings; while the State bound itself to pay the whole of the income from the 
land grant to this college as long as it fulfilled its part of the contract. 
In adopting another institution for its colored department the university was fol- 
lowing the example of the State in this original arrangement with it. 
When colored men prepared themselves and secured appointments the board made 
an arrangement with Fisk University to educate them. At first the requirements 
comprised only the elementary branches of the common school course. The first 
colored men who entered were sent to Fisk University about 1882. As white 
students received free tuition, the tuition of the colored appointees was paid at Fisk. 
The examinations were held by the county superintendents at Fisk University and 
at the University of Tennessee, at Knoxville, and there were sometimes 30 or 40 of 
these in a year. 
When Knoxville College was established some time later, a similar arrangement 
was made with it and colored appointees had the option of going to Fisk or to Knox- 
ville College. This increased the numbers still further. 
In 1887 the board decided to consult the attorney-general of the State about this 
and all the other conditions of its contract with the State. We desired to be ad- 
vised in a proper manner about our duties and legal responsibilities to the State 
before going on with the new plans then proposed. 
With regard to this question of a colored department the attorney-general thought 
that we had done all that was required of us or could be done in the premises; but 
he advised us that all the departments of the university should be located at Knox- 
Ville, if possible, in immediate connection with the original departments, where they 
 
-P-A-G-E-365
KNOXVILLE COLLEGE. DAL 
could be under the supervision of the president, board, and faculty. So long as we 
had an cpportunity to do so, he thought this our plain duty, 
Accordingly, in 1888, Fisk University was duly notified not to receive any addi- 
tional students, and that, as soon as those then matriculated should finish their 
courses, the university would cease to send appointees there. 
Negotiations were commenced at once with Knoxville College, which had devel- 
oped into a most excellent school, and, as soon as the funds could be released from 
the other contracts, a new and closer contract was made with the management of 
this institution. 
Under this new arrangement, which went into effect in 1890, Knoxville College 
agreed to establish a new department of the sciences and industries ‘“ pertaining to 
agriculture and the mechanic arts,” to be called the industrial department, for which 
it should provide the land and buildings, and the University of Tennessee should 
proyide the equipment, teachers, and all current expenses. This made this college 
a complete one according to the requirements of the land-grant act, as it already had 
full literary and mathematical schools. The board of the university elects the teach- 
ers, makes appropriations from the income on land grant and its additions, makes 
rules, ete., for this industrial department, while the board of Knoxville College sup- 
ports and controls the previously existing literary department. In other matters 
the two boards act together. There is only one executive, however, the president 
of Knoxville College. 
This industrial department is being built and equipped now. The writer visited 
the board of the United Presbyterian Church at Pittsburg, Pa., who have been the 
generous patrons of this institution ever since its foundation, and secured from them 
an appropriation for the new building required. It has facilities for instruction in 
chemistry and botany, scientific agriculture, physics, and drawing, and practical 
work in farming, gardening, and shop work in wood andiron. The State appointees 
are required to take either a scientific or industrial course in this college. They 
receive their literary and mathematical training in the other departments of the col- 
lege. The contract provides that they shall have free tuition in all the general 
departments of the college, and, in return for this, the other students of Knoxville 
College are to have free tuition in the industrial department after the State ap- 
pointees are accommodated. 
So Knoxville College became, in fact, a department of the University of Tennes- 
see. 
The tendency is to bring it more and more under the care and influence of the 
general faculty of the university. Special regular teachers are employed for the 
industrial department of Knoxville College, but their instruction is supplemented 
by lectures by our regular professors when necessary. 
The standard for admission has been raised and it is now the same (or as nearly 
the same as possible) for whites and colored, with the understanding that the exam- 
iners will be lenient to the colored man, 
There were 16 colored students last year, and the number will increase largely 
when the new department has had time to illustrate its plans.! 
The board of the university has created twelve separate apprenticeships in this 
department, worth $50 per annum, for the purpose of aiding poor and meritorious 
students in getting an education. 
We believe that this college now provides for the “brother in black” the kind of 
education which he needs most. The schools established by churches and benevo-

tled to about 69 of the 275 cadetships, led a committee of the general assembly ‘in 
February, 1891, to recommend that a colored appointee to the State University be 
allowed to attend either the school at Knoxville or one of the four schools: Fisk,

lent peopie at the North have naturally aimed to give him a literary education 
which would qualify him to teach or preach. This has, we think, been carried too 
far. It is the aim of the University of Tennessee, as it believes it is its duty, under 
this important trust, to provide industrial education for him, The interest mani- 
fested and the success already attained encourage us to expect splendid results from 
this experiment,

ROGER WILLIAMS UNIVERSITY. 
Roger Williams University is one of some fifteen schools for the freed- 
men whose establishment is mainly due to the American Baptist Home 
Mission Society. This society began missionary and educational work 
among the Negroes as early as 1862. In the summer of 1864 it sent 
Rey. Daniel W. Phillips, p- D., to Nashville to start a school. Dr. 
Phillips was by birth a Welshman. He had come to America while a 
young man and by dint of unremitting toil and the closest economy had 
acquired an education at Brown University when that institution was 
under the presidency of the celebrated Dr. Wayland. It was his con- 
viction that it was his duty to come that now brought him into this 
new field. 
For some time after reaching Nashville Dr. Phillips had charge of the 
Ceniral Baptist Church, whose membership was white. At the same 
time he was teaching and preparing for the ministry a class of young 
colored men, at first in the basement of the First Colored Baptist 
Church, afterwards in his own house. Being on the alert for a place 
in which to regularly open his school, he purchased a lot near Fort 
Gillem and removed to it a two-story frame building bought of the 
Government for $1,000. The Home Mission Society paid for the build- 
ing, but $6,000 or $7,000 more were needed to pay for the lot and to set 
up and remodel the building. An effort to obtain assistance from the 
Freedmen’s Bureau proved fruitless, as did also a subsequent attempt to 
secure an appropriation from the Peabody fund. Dr. Phillips and Rev. 
W. C. Rush, who had become associated with him, then went North to 
raise the money, Dr. Phillips going to New England, and Mr. Rush to 
Ohio. Their mission was successful and in 1867 the Nashville Normal 
and Theological Institute was opened. Asits name implied, its primary 
object was the education and preparation of teachers and preachers, 
The school prospered and with its prosperity the need of larger and 
better accommodations grew imperative. Dr. Phillips determined to 
buy a site on Fort Gillem, the fort crowning the hill on whose side was 
situated the institute. He went to New England to raise the purchase 
money. After securing enough promises to make it certain that he 
would be able to collect the whole sum, he wrote to a friend in Nash-

ville tomake the purchase, but only to learn that he had been forestalled 
by Fisk University. Dr. Phillips was sorely disappointed. The now 
urgent needs of the school demanded immediate action. Rev. Dr. 
Simmons, secretary of the American Baptist Home Mission Society, 
came to Nashville, and with Dr, Phillips spent a month in canvassing 
for a location for the school. At last the present location, on the Hills- 
boro turnpike, 2 miles from the heart of the city, was selected. There 
were a mansion house and outbuildings and 30 acres of land beautifully 
situated on elevated ground. The Mission Society was not able to pay 
the price asked—$30,000, Thereupon Dr. Nathan Bishop and wife, of 
New York, offered to furnish the means, and the place was bought. Two 
stories were added to the mansion house, making it four stories in all. 
Plans were made and work begun on an additional building, to cost 
$10,000 or $12,000. Dr. and Mrs. Bishop again stepped in, and a build- 
ing costing three times as much was erected instead. Centennial Hall, 
as this building is called, is a four-story brick exclusive of basement, 
49 feet in width by 185 feet inlength. The basement is used as a board- 
ing department, the first floor for school purposes, and the three upper 
floors as dormitories for young men. 
The Mansion House, also a four-story brick, is 48 feet in width by 
80 feet in length, and furnishes apartments for some of the teachers and 
dormitories for the young women. The Mansion House and Centennial 
Hall are united by a hall way and at a distance present the appear- 
ance of a single structure. Since these buildings were erected two 
residences have been built on the grounds, one for the president and 
ene for the principal of the normal school. The institute was removed 
to its new location on the first Wednesday in October, 1876. In 1883 
it was incorporated as Roger Williams University. Dr. Phillips de- 
plored the change of name; no good would come of calling the school 
what it was not; possessed of the name of a university it would ape 
the ways of a university; its true scope would be lost sight of and its 
true aim perverted. 
At the top of the curriculum stands the college course of four years, 
Next below is the college preparatory course of three years. Then 
comes the normal course, and still lower the English department, far- 
nishing elementary instruction. There is also a theological course of 
two years. The rudiments of knowledge are thoroughly taught; the 
college course is not very full and not very advanced. The degrees of 
B. A. and B. 8. are conferred upon graduates. Bachelers of three 
years’ standing who in the mean time have been engaged in literary or 
scientific pursuits are admitted to the master’s degree on the presenta- 
tion of a suitable thesis. The degree of bachelor of divinity is given 
to such as complete both the college and the theological course. Pro- 
vision is made for instruction in instrumental and vecal music. In- 
dustrial training for both sexes is supported by an annual appropria- 
tion “of $1,000 from the Slater fund.

Every student is required to, do work for the university amounting 
to one hour daily or pay $2 per month in lieu thereof. The whole ten- 
dency is to dignify labor. Another thing in which Roger Williams is 
like the other colored schools of the State is this: All of them are 
under the patronage of some Christian organization, and religious edu- 
cation is deemed of paramount importance; Roger Williams has daily 
elasses in Bible study, and every student is required to attend one of 
these classes. ‘Recognizing the importance of exercise in student 
life, a military company has been formed under the laws of the State, 
and regular drill is given in military tactics.” The enrollment of 
Roger Williams has reached nearly 300; in 1888~’89 it was 286; in 
188990, 273; in 189091, 226. Among these is found a number of 
“State normal” students. The majority of the students teach school 
during vacation and many of them do so during a part of the school 
year. 
Dr. Phillips was at the head of the Nashville Normal and Theological 
Institute until 1882, when he was succeeded by Rev. William Stewart. 
Dr. Phillips retained his professorship, however, and when the institute 
was incorporated as Roger Williams University he was elected president 
of the board of trustees, a position which he held until his death,in April, 
1890. Rey. William Stewart was president of the school until 1884, 
Rey. Edward ©. Mitchell was then president pro tempore for one year. 
From 1885 to 1887 the position was filled by Rev. William H. Stiffler. 
In 1887 Rey. Dr. A. Owen, the present president, came into office. 
Dr. Owen was for seven years president of Denison University. Six 
male and 5 female teachers assist him in the work of instruction. The 
goger Williams property is valued at $100,000. With its splendid site 
and handsome buildings the university adds no little to the beauty of 
Nashyille’s environs. Moreover it is one of the institutions that make 
Nashville the educational center of the South for blacks as well as 
whites.

HOFFMAN HALL. 
Hoffman Hall is the living attestation at once of the zeal of a great 
church for the uplifting-of the Negro and of the kindly feelings of 
brotherhood that exist between two denominations of Christians. It is 
a theological college of the Protestant Episcopal Church for the educa- 
tion and practical training of colored candidates for the ministry estab- 
lished in connection with and located in proximity to Fisk University, 
a colored institution of the Congregational Church. The Episcopalians 
have no school in Tennessee for the higher education of the Negro,.and 
by invitation of the authorities of the Fisk they founded their theolog-

ical school by the side of the Fisk, where their students enjoy at the 
same cost the same advantages as Fisk students. ‘Undergraduates 
reside in the hall, and either pursue the full classical course at Fisk 
University, taking their degree (recommended wherever possible), 
or pursue such partial course at the university, supplemented by 
studies at the hall, as may be arranged by the principal.” The past 
year, the first year in the history of Hoffman Hall, there were four 
theological and four undergraduate students. The regular instructors 
are Rev. Meredith O. Smith, B. D., principal of the hall, and Archdeacon 
Colbraith B. Perry. Four “honorary professors,” pastors of churches 
in different parts of the country, are in residence annually from two to 
three weeks each, during which time they give daily instruction. Hoff- 
man Hall is so named in honor of Rev. Charles F. Hoffman, D. D., by 
the aid of whose munificence it was built. A small debt still remains 
unpaid.

CHAPTER XII. 
THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM OF TENNESSER. 
By TuappEus P. Tuomas, M. A. 
FAILURE TO RECOGNIZE IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS, 
‘One cause of the slow development of the system of public schools 
in Tennessee and throughout the entire South has been the failure to 
recognize the importance of laying a good educational foundation. 
There has been a tendency to forget the fact that the effectiveness of 
the higher education depends largely upon the vitality of the common 
schools. In New England colleges were organized before there was an 
efficient public-school system; but if New England was the first to make 
the error she was also the first to rectify it. In the West, owing to the 
wise provisions of the ordinance of 1787, the educational system “was 
built from the bottom.” In the South the case has too often been the 
reverse. In addition to this, public sentiment in all the earlier history 
of the State was never warmly in sympathy with the idea of State man- 
agement of common schools, but it was believed that these would suc- 
ceed better in private hands. It is largely due to these causes that the 
public-school system of Tennessee, as a vigorous and effective system, 
has no real history before 1873.1 
PUBLIC LANDS IN TENNESSEE CEDED TO THE STATE. 
In 1790 North Carolina ceded all the land within the present limits 
of the State to the General Government. In 1796 Tennessee was admit- 
‘ted into the Union, but the General Government retained the public 
Jands. It was not until 1806 that Congress ceded these lands to the 
State: , 
Provisions were made for the benefit of education similar to those made in tho 
ease of Ohio, but differing in one important particular. In Ohio, and in the other 
States carved out of the Northwest Territory, the sixteenth section in each town- 
ship was designated and conveyed direct to the inhabitants of the township. Tho 
admirable system of United States surveys definitely located the grant, and the 
title was vested in the township. Tennessee, which had been admitted ten years 
before its land cession, had not been reached by this system of surveys. The town- 
ship and section could not, therefore, be designated, and Congress did not vest title 
in the inhabitants of a township or district. The provision was in the following 
words: “And the State of Tennessee shall, moreover, in issuing grants and perfect- 
1(See paper on ‘Education in the South,” by W. R. Garrett, in the “Proceedings 
of the Department of Superintendence of the National Educational Association,” at 
its meeting in Washington, March, 1889.)

ing titles locate 640 acres to every 6 miles square in the territory hereby ceded where 
existing claims will allow the same, which shall be appropriated for the use of 
schools for the instruction of children forever.” This provision imposed a duty on 
the State, but failed to vest the title in the subordinate civil division. Tennessee had 
no series of civil divisions of 6 miles square corresponding to the township. The grant 
was not thus definitely located and vested. In the mean time much of the land had 
been taken up by valid claims and with the rapid stream of immigration which 
poured in the squatter preceded the surveyor. Many acts were passed by the legis- 
lature to protect the school lands, but from the vague nature of the grant and pos- 
sibly from the failure to appreciate its value, the opportunity to utilize it was lost.t 
The same act of Congress provided that 100,000 acres of land should 
be set apart for the use of academies, one academy for each county; 
and 100,000 acres for the use of two colleges, which have since devel- 
oped into the Peabody Normal College and the State University at 
Knoxville. 
ACT OF 1830. 
Though the messages of the governors constantly refer to the sub- 
ject, no definite plan for a system of public instruction was attempted 
until the passage of the act of January 14, 1830, by which provision 
was made for laying off school districts. Five trustees were to be 
elected in each district and the chairmen of the boards of trustees were 
to select commissioners who were to divide the school money appropri- 
ated for their county among the several districts. The trustees were 
.to employ and dismiss teachers and make annual reports to the com- 
missioners, who were then to make annual reports to the legislature. 
An important clause in the constitution of 1834 was the one which 
provided that the common-school fund should be “a perpetual fund, 
the principal of which should never be diminished by legislative appro- 
priations.” But the school money was used for private purposes more 
than once, and in one case this was done by the superintendent of pub- 
lic schools, Robert H. McEwen, who had been elected in 1836. A large 
part of the school fund was also lost on the failure of the Bank of 
Tennessee, which had been created in 1838 and in which the school fund 
had been invested. But the State has made good these losses. 
THE WAR, 
Previous to the war there was no real vigor in the public school sys- 
tem. The State superintendent did not have sufficient executive power, 
but was merely an agent to look after the school fund. The system 
was characterized by a lack of unity in its organization. The interest 
on the sehool fund, amounting to $90,000 annually, was distributed 
among the counties; but the sum was so small and so injudiciously 
used that the schools were generally maintained only a few weeks out 
of the year. During the war education was practically suspended 
throughout the South. The evils resulting from the war continued for

many years. Historians are accustomed to give vivid accounts of the 
destruction of life and devastation of property caused by war, but they 
frequently fail to point out its disastrous effects on the intellectual 
advancement of a nation. The cause of education in the South had to 
wait until the people began to regain their material prosperity; for it 
is invariably true that the wants of the body must have attention before 
those of the mind. In addition to the other burdens left as a legacy of 
the war, the State found its population largely increased by the eman- 
cipated Negroes, who must be educated at the expense of the white 
people, as they were unable to contribute towards their own education. 
ACT OF 1867. 
In spite of all difficulties, a law was enacted in 1867 establishing a 
State system of public schools. The office of State superintendent of pub- 
lie instruction which had been filled by the treasurer! was put into the 
hands of Gen. John Eaton, who discharged its duties with energy and 
ability. The law was on the whole a good one, butit had been enacted 
in advance of public sentiment and it soon failed. The point had not 
yet been reached where the people were either willing or able to tax 
themselves to maintain a first-class educational system. There was in 
many quarters a bitter opposition to the organization of the schools. 
THE ACT OF 1870. 
The law of -1870 practically repealed the law of 1867. The State 
relinquished all efficient control, and virtually turned over the whole 
subject of common-school education to the different counties. The 
result was that in 1872 only twenty-nine out of the ninety-three counties 
of the State levied any educational tax whatever. Itis estimated that 
not one-fifth of the scholastic population of the State had any means of 
education. ‘Indeed, in some of the counties visited there was not a 
single school, either public or private, in operation; nor were there any 
efforts being made by the citizens to remedy the deficiency.” 
THE ACT OF 1873. 
The system established by the law of 1873 is, with some amendments, 
the one which is in operation to-day. After it was once established 
there was a marvelous advancement in the efficiency of the schools in 
1By the act of 1844 the office of superintendent of public instruction had been 
abolished and the duties of the office transferred to the treasurer. By the act of 
1867 the office of superintendent of common schools was created, to be filled bienni- 
ally by the vote of the people. This act was repealed in 1870 and the superinten- 
dent given ninety days in which to wind up the affairs of his office. The office of 
superintendent of public instruction was recreated February 3, 1871, but the treas- 
urer of the State was made superintedent ex oficio. It was made a separate office by 
the act of 1873.

THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. _ 285 
spite of prejudice, opposition, and monetary depression; and the sys- 
tem is one of which the State may well be proud. In accordance with 
its provisions the administration is in the hands of a State superin- 
tendent, county superintendents, and district school directors. The 
State superintendent is nominated by the governor and confirméd by 
the senate. The county superintendent is elected biennially by the 
county court and is paid for his services by the same body. There 
are three directors elected biennially by the qualified voters of the 
district. It is their duty to enforce the school laws, employ and dis- 
miss teachers, take care of the school property, and use the school 
money for the best interests of the schools. The school age is between 
6 and 21 years. S 
THE SCHOOL FUND. 
The school fund is a legal fiction. There is no real fund in existence, 
but the State pays out of its taxes the interest on $2,500,000 semi- 
annually for the support of the schools. To this are added the proceeds 
of all escheated property, of all property accruing to the State by for- 
feiture, of all lands sold and bought in for taxes, and of the permanent 
effects of intestates. Every male inhabitant is subject to a poll tax of 
$1, and a tax of 14 mills on the dollar is annually assessed upon all 
property subject to taxation for the support of the public schools. These 
taxes are collected as other taxes are, and are paid over to the county trus- 
tee in the county where collected and distributed to each school district 
according to scholastic population. When these taxes are insufficient 
to keep up a public school for five months in the year in the districts of 
the county, ‘“ the county court shall levy an additional tax sufficient for 
this purpose, or shall submit the proposition to a vote of the people, and 
may levy a tax to prolong the schools beyond the five months; said tax 
to be levied on all property, polls, and privileges liable to taxation, but 
shall not exceed the entire State tax.”. The mayor and board of alder- 
men of cities and incorporated towns can establish high schools and are 
empowered to levy an additional tax for the purpose. 
AMENDMENT OF 1891. 
An important amendment to the original bill was passed in 1891, 
providing that there shall be two classes of schools: Primary schools, 
consisting of five grades, and secondary schools, which give the same 
instruction that is given in the primary schools and have three addi- 
tional grades. The primary schools teach orthography, reading, 
writing, arithmetic, grammar, geography, history of Tennessee, and 
history of the United States. Vocal music and elocution may be 
taught. The secondary schools teach these additional studies: Ele- 
mentary geology of Tennessee, elementary principles of agriculture, 
elements of algebra, elements of plane geometry, elements of natural

philosophy, bookkeeping, elementary physiology and hygiene, ele- 
ments of civil government, and rhetoric. Practice is also given in elo- 
cution and vocal music may be taught.

THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. 287 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
One of the most powerful auxiliaries to the public schools has been 
the system of institutes established in connection with them. These 
were first regularly organized in the summer of 1874 through assistance 
obtained from the Peabody education fund. County institutes were 
also organized and the scope of the work has steadily increased since 
then. In 1891 $1,500 was appropriated by the State and $2,000 by the 
Peabody education fund for carrying on institutes, These appropria- 
tions were distributed between the two races in the ratio of their scho- 
lastie population. 
In a free country the success of the schools depends largely upon the 
confidence and intelligent codperation of the masses, and the value of 
these institutes lies in the fact that they have not only “ educated the 
educator ” in better methods of instruction, but have prepared the way 
for a vast improvement of the present prosperous condition of the 
schools by arousing the interest of the people in the cause of education 
more effectively than any other agency has ever done.

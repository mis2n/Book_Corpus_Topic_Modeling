JOHN HENRY NEWMAN 
Born in 1801, died in 1890; son of a banker; educated at 
Oxford; a Fellow of Oriel in 1822, where he was asso- 
ciated with Dr. Pusey; made a voyage to the Mediter- 
ranean in 1832-33, returning from which he wrote “Lead, 
Kindly Light”; joined the Oxford movement in 1833, wri- 
ting many of the “tracts for the times”; formally joined 
the Qatholic Church in 1845; established an Oratory in 
1849; published “Lectures” in 1850, the “Apologia” in 
1864, “Grammar of Ascent” in 1870; made a cardinal 
. in 1879. 
I 
THE BEGINNINGS OF TRACTARIANISM* 
During the first years of my residence at Oriel, 
tho proud of my college, I was not quite at home 
there. I was very much alone, and I used often 
to take my daily walk by myself. I recollect 
once meeting Dr. Copleston, then Provost, with 
one of the Fellows. He turned round, and with 
the kind courteousness which sat so well on him, 
made me a bow and said, Nunquam minus solus, 
quam cum solus. At that time, indeed (from 
1823), I had the intimacy of my dear and true 
friend Dr. Pusey, and could not fail to adniire 
and revere a soul so devoted to the eause of 
religion, so full of good works, so faithful in his 
affections; but he léft residence whea I was

getting to know him well. As to Dr. Whately ” 
himself, he was too much my superior to allow 
of my being at my ease with him; and to no one 
in Oxford at this time did I open my heart fully 
and familiarly. But things changed in 1826. At 
that time I became one of the tutors of my eol- 
lege, and this gave me position; besides, I had 
written one or two essays which had been well 
received. I began to be known. I preached my 
first University sermon. Next year I was one 
of the publie examiners for the B. A. degree. 
In 1828 I became vicar of St. Mary’s. It was 
to me like the feeling of spring weather after 
winter; and, if I may so speak, I came out of 
my shell. I remained out of it until 1841, 
The two persons who knew me best at that 
time are still alive, beneficed clergymen, no 
longer my friends. They could tell better than 
any one else what I was in those days. From 
this time my tongue was, as it were, loosened, 
and I spoke spontaneously and without effort. 
One of the two, a shrewd man, said of me, I have 
been told, ‘Here is a Fellow who, when he is 
silent, will never begin to speak, and when he 
once begins to speak will never stop.’’ It was 
at this time that I began to have influence, which 
steadily inereased for a course of years. I 
gained upon my pupils, and was in particular 
intimate and affectionate with two of our Pro- 
bationer Fellows, Robert Isaac Wilberforce 
* Richard Whately, Bampton lecturer at Oxford in 1822; principal of St. Albans Hall in 1825; afterward Arch- bishop of Dublin; best known for his “Logic” and “Chris- tian Evidences.” When Newman met him, he was already 
famous for his “Historical Doubts Relative to Napoleon Bonaparte,” which had been published in 1814.

(afterward Archdeacon), and Richard Hurrell 
Froude” Whately then, an acute man, perhaps 
saw around me the signs of an incipient party 
of which I was not conscious myself. And thus 
we discern the first elements of that movement 
afterward called Tractarian, The true and pri- 
mary author of it, however, as is usual with 
great motive powers, was out of sight. Having 
carried off, as a mere boy, the highest honors 
of the University, he had turned from the ad- 
miration which haunted his steps, and sought for 
a better and holier satisfaction in pastoral work 
in the country. 
Need I say that I am speaking of John 
Keble?‘ The first time that I was in a room 
with him was on the oceasion of my election to 
a Fellowship at Oriel, when I was sent for into 
the Tower, to shake hands with the Provost and 
Fellows. How is that hour fixt in my memory 
after the changes of forty-two years; forty-two 
this very day on which I write! I have lately 
had a Jetter in my hands which I sent at the 
time to my great friend, John William Bowden, 
with whom I passed almost exclusively my under- 
graduate years. ‘‘I had to hasten to the Tower,’’ 
2A brother of James Anthony Froude. Richard Hurrell 
Froude's influence on the founding of the Tractarian move- 
ment was strong. He cooperated with Newman in writing 
the “Lyra Apostotica.” His health had long been delicate, 
when in 1836 he died. His “Remains” were published in 
the following year, with a preface by Newman. Three 
of the “Tracts for the Times” were by Froude. 
‘Keble, one of the chief promoters of the Oxford move- 
ment, will Jong be remembered as author of ‘The Christian 
Year,” published in 1827. For ten years he was Professor 
of Poetry at Oxford. Three of the ‘Tracts for the Times’ 
were by him. He was Newman’s senior by eight years. 
5

I say to him, ‘‘to receive the congratulations cf 
all the Fellows. I bore it till Keble took my 
hand, and then felt so abashed and unworthy 
of the honor done to me, that I seemed desirous 
of quite sinking into the ground.’’ His had been 
the first name which I had heard spoken of, 
with reverence rather than admiration, when I 
came up to Oxford. When one day I was walk- 
ing in High Street with my dear earliest friend 
just mentioned, with what eagerness did he cry 
out, ‘‘There’s Keble!’’ and with what awe did 
I look at him! Then at another time I heard a 
Master of Arts of my college give an account 
how he had just then had occasion to introduce 
himself on some business to Keble, and how gen- 
tle, courteous, and unaffected Keble had been, 
so as almost to put him out of countenance. 
Then, too, it- was reported, truly or falsely, how 
a rising man of brilliant reputation, the present 
Dean of St. Paul’s, Dr. Milman, admired and 
loved him, adding, that somehow he was strangely 
unlike any one else. Howevér, at the time when 
I was elected Fellow of Oriel, he was not in 
residence, and he was shy of me for years, in 
consequence of the marks which I bore upon me 
of the Evangelical and Liberal schools, at least 
so I have ever thought. Hurrell Froude brought 
us together about 1828; it is one of the sayings 
preserved in his ‘‘Remains’’—‘‘Do you know 
the story of the murderer who had done one 
good thing in his life? Well, if I was ever asked 
what good thing I had ever done, I should say 
I had brought Keble and Newman to understand 
each other.’’

ON HIS SUBMISSION TO THE CATHOLIC 
CHURCH* 
I wap one final advance of mind to accomplish, 
and one final step to take. That further advance 
of mind was to be able honestly to say that I was 
certain of the conclusions at which I had already 
arrived. That further step, imperative when 
such certitude was attained, was my submission 
to the Catholie Church. 
This submission did not take place till two full 
years after the resignation of my living in Sep- 
tember 1843; nor could I have made it at an 
earlier date, without doubt and apprehension; 
that is, with any true conviction of mind or 
certitude. 
In the interval, of which it remains to speak— 
viz., between the autumns of 1843 and 1845—I 
was in lay communion with the Church of Eng- 
Jand: attending its services as usual, and ab- 
staining altogether from intercourse with Cath- 
olics, from their places of worship, and from 
those religious rites and usages, such ‘as the 
5From the “Apologia.” Newman, for many years, had 
held to the possibility of English churchmen maintaining a 
middle ground between the Catholic Church and Protes- 
tantism, but in 1843 he abandoned this hope, resigning his 
living, and in 1845 formally entered the Catholic Church. 
He says in the “Apologia” that “from the end of 1841, 
I was on my death-hed as regards my membership with 
the Anglican church, tho at the time I became aware of 
it only by degrees.”

Tnvoeation of Saints, which are characteristics 
of their ereed. I did all this on principle; for 
I never could understand how a man could be 
of two religions at once. 
What I have to say about myself between these 
two autumns I shall almost confine to this one 
point—the difficulty I was in as to the best mode 
of revealing the state of my mind to my friends 
and others, and how I managed to reveal it. 
_ Up to January, 1842, I had not disclosed my 
state of unsettlement. to more than three per- 
sons. . . . To two of them, intimate and 
familiar companions, in the autumn of 1839; to 
the third—an old friend too, whom I have also 
named above—I suppose when I was in great 
distress of mind upon the affair of the Jerusalem 
Bishopric. In May, 1843, I made it known, as 
has been seen, to the friend by whose advice I 
wished, as far as possible, to be guided. To men- 
tion it on set purpose to any one, unless indeed 
I was asking advice, I should have felt to be 
aerime. If there is anything that was abhorrent 
to me, it was the scattering doubts, and unset- 
tling consciences without necessity. A strong 
presentiment that my existing opinions would 
ultimately give way, and that the grounds of 
them were unsound, was not a sufficient warrant 
for disclosing the state of my mind. I had no 
guarantee yet, that that presentiment would be 
realized. Supposing I were crossing ice, which 
eame right in my way, which I had good reasons 
for considering sound, and which I saw numbers 
before me crossing in safety, and supposing a 
stranger from the bank, in a voice of authority 
and in an earnest tone, warned me that it was 
8

  dangerous, and then was silent—I think I should 
be startled, and should look about me anxiously, 
but I think too that I should go on, till I had 
better grounds for doubt; and such was my state, 
I believe, till the end of 1842. Then again, when 
my dissatisfaction became greater, it was hard 
at first to determine the point of time when it 
was too strong to suppress with propriety. Cer- 
titude of course is a point, but doubt is a prog- 
ress: I was not near certitude yet. Certitude is 
a reflex action; it is to know that one knows. 
Of that I believe I was not possest, till close 
upon my reception into the Catholic Church. 
Again, a practical, effective doubt is a point too; 
but who can easily ascertain it for himself? Whe 
ean determine when it is that the scales in the 
balance of opinion begin to turn, and what was 
a greater probability in behalf of a belief be- 
comes a positive doubt against it? 
In considering this question in its bearing upon 
my conduct in 1843, my own simple answer to 
my great difficulty had been, Do what your pres- 
ent state of opinion requires in the light of duty, 
and let that doing tell; speak by acts. This I 
had done; my first act of the year had been in 
February. After three months’ deliberation I 
had published my retractation of the violent 
charges which I had made against Rome: I could 
not be wrong in doing so much as this; but I 
did no more at the time: I did not retract my 
Anglican teaching. My second act had been in 
September in the same year: after much sorrow- 
ful lingering and hesitation, I had resigned my 
Living. I tried indeed, before I did so, to keep 
Littlemore for myself, even tho it was still to

  remain an integral part of St. Mary’s.’ I had 
given to it a church and a sort of paFsonage; 
E had made it a parish, and I loved it: I thought 
in 1843 that perhaps I need not’ forfeit my -ex- 
isting relations toward it. I could indeed sub- 
mit to become a curate at will of another; but I 
hoped an arrangement was possible by which, 
while I had the euraey, I might have been my 
own master in serving it. I had hoped an ex- 
ception might have been made in my favor, under 
the circumstances; but I did not gain my request. 
Perhaps I was asking what was impracticable, 
and it is well for.me that it was: so. 
- These had been my two acts. of the year, and 
I said,.‘‘I can not be wrong in making them; 
let that follow which must follow in the thoughts 
of the world about me, when they see what I 
do.’’ And as time went on, they fully answered 
my purpose. What I felt it a simple duty to do, 
did create a general suspicion about me, without 
such responsibility as would be involved in my 
initiating any direct act for the sake of creating 
it. Then, when friends wrote me on the subject, 
I either did not deny or I confest my state of 
mind, aecording to the character and need of 
their letters. Sometimes in the case of intimate 
friends, whom I should otherwise have been 
8St. Mary’s was the church of the University of Oxford, 
Newman being its vicar. Littlemore was an outlying place 
attached to St. Mary’s and to which Newman withdrew 
on leaving Oxford in 1842. Here, with several young men 
who had attached themselves to his fortunes, he estab- 
lished himself in a building which came to be known as 
“the Littlemore Monastery.” It was here that Newman 
passed the three years of meditation and anxiety whick 
preceded his final decision to join the Roman Church. 
10
-P-A-G-E-24
  _JOHN HENRY NEWMAN 
  leaving in ‘ignorance of what others knew on 
every side of them, I invited the question. 
And here comes in another point for explana- 
tion. While I was fighting in Oxford for the 
Anglican Church, then indeed I was very glad 
to make converts; and tho I never broke away 
from that rule of my mind (as I may eall it) 
of which I have already spoken, of finding dis- 
ciples rather than seeking them, yet that. I made 
advances to others in a special way, I have no 
doubt; this came to an end, however, as soon as 
I fell into misgivings as to the true ground to 
be taken in the controversy. For then, when I 
gave up my place in the movement, I ceased from 
any such proceedings; and my utmost endeavor 
was to tranquillize such persons, especially those 
who belonged to the new school, as were unset- 
tled in their religious views, and as I judged, 
hasty in their conclusions. This went on till 1843; 
but at that date, as soon as I turned my face 
Romeward, I gave up, as far as ever was pos- 
sible, the thought of, in any respect and in any 
shape, acting upon others.. Then I myself was 
simply my own concern. How could I in any 
sense direct. others, who had to be guided in so 
momentous a matter myself? How could I be 
considered in a position, even to say a word to 
them, one way or the other? How could I pre- 
sume to unsettle them as I was unsettled, when 
I had no means of bringing them out of such 
unsettlement? And if they were unsettled al- 
ready, how could I point to them a place of 
refuge, when I was not sure that I should choose 
it for myself? My only line, my only duty, was 
to keep simply to my own ease. I recollected 
i
-P-A-G-E-25
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  Paseal’s words, ‘‘Je mourrai seul’? [I will die 
alone]. I deliberately put out of my thoughts 
all other works and claims, and said nothing to 
any one, unless I was obliged. 
But this brought upon me a great trouble. In 
the newspapers there were continual reports 
about my intentions; I did not answer them: 
presently strangers or friends wrote, begging to 
be allowed to answer them; and if I still kept 
to my resolution and said nothing, then I was 
thought to be mysterious, and a prejudice was 
excited against me. But what was far worse, 
there were a number of tender, eager hearts, of 
whom I knew nothing at all, who were watching 
me, wishing to think as I thought, and to do as 
I did, if they could but find it out; who in con- 
sequence were distrest that in so solemn a matter 
they could not see what was coming, and who 
heard reports about me this way or that, on a 
first day and on a second; and felt the weariness 
of waiting, and the sickness of delayed hope, 
and did not understand that I was as perplexed 
as they were, and being of more sensitive com- 
plexion of mind than myself, they were made ill 
by the suspense. And they too, of course, for 
the time thought me mysterious and inexplicable. 
I ask their pardon as far as I was really unkind 
to them. ... . 
I left Oxford for good on Monday, February 
23d, 1846. On the Saturday and Sunday before, 
I was in my house at Littlemore simply by my- 
self, as I had been for the first day or two when 
I had originally taken possession of it. I slept 
on Sunday night at my dear friend’s, Mr. John- 
son’s, at the Observatory. Various friends came 
12
-P-A-G-E-26
  JOHN HENRY. NEWMAN   
to see the last of me: Mr. Copeland, Mr. Chureh, 
Mr. Buckle, Mr. Pattison, and Mr. Lewis. Dr. 
Pusey too came up to take leave of. me; and I 
called on Dr. Ogle, one of my very oldest friends, 
for he was my private tutor when I was an 
undergraduate. In him I took leave of my first 
college, Trinity, which was so dear to me, and 
which held on its foundation so many who had 
been kind to me both when I was a boy, and all 
through my Oxford life. Trinity had never been 
unkind to me. There used to be much snap- 
dragon growing on the walls opposite my fresh- 
man’s rooms there; and I had for years taken 
it as the emblem of my own perpetual residence, 
even unto death, in my University. 
On the morning of the 23d I left the Observa- 
tory. I have never seen Oxford since, excepting 
its spires as they are seen from the railway.

the continent, the city seemed hardly suited for 
the duties of a central metropolis of knowledge; 
yet what it lost in convenience of approach, it 
gained in its neighborhood to the traditions of 
the mysterious East, and in the loveliness of the © 
region in which it lay. Hither, then, as to a 
sort of ideal land, where all the archetypes of 
the great and the fair were found in substantial 
being, and all departments of truth explored, and 
all diversities of intellectual power exhibited; 
where taste and philosophy were majestically 
enthroned as in a royal court; where there was 
no sovereignity but that of mind, and no no- 
bility but that of genius; where professors were 
rulers and princes did homage,—hither flocked 
continually from the very corners of the orbis 
terrarum, the many-tongued generation, just ri- 
sing or just risen into manhood, in order to gain 
wisdom. 
Pisistratus ° had at an early age discovered and 
nursed the infant genius of his people, and 
Cimon,’ after the Persian war, had given it a 
home; that war had established the naval 
supremacy of Athens; she had become an im- 
perial state; and the Ionians, bound to her by 
the double chain of kindred and. of subjection, 
were importing into her both their merchandise 
and their civilization. The arts and philosophy 
of the Asiatie Court were easily carried across 
8 Pisistratus flourished from 605 B.c. until 527. He was 
a friend of Solon, but usurped supreme power in 560; was 
twice expelled and then restored to power. He is usually 
credited with a notable systematic attempt to preserve the 
works of Homer. 
*Cimon died in 449 B.c. He was @ son of Miltiades 
and defeated the Persians on both sea and land im 466.

  the sea, and. there was Cimon, as. I -have said, 
with his ample fortune, ready to’ receive them 
with due honor. Not content with patronizing» 
their profession, he built the first of those noble- 
porticoes, of which we hear so much in Athens, 
and he formed the groves, which in process of 
time formed. the celebrated academy. Planting 
is one of the most graceful, as.in Athens it was 
one of the most beneficent, of employments: 
Cimon took in -hand the wild wood, pruned and 
drest it, and laid it. out with handsome -walks 
and weleome fountains. Nor, while hospitable 
to the authors of the city’s civilization, was he 
ungrateful to the instruments of her prosperity. 
His trees extended their cool, umbrageous 
branches over the merchants who assembled. in 
the Agora, for many generations. 
Those merchants certainly had deserved that 
act of bounty; for all the while their ships had 
been carrying forth the intellectual fame of 
Athens to the Western world. Then commenced 
what may be called her university existence. 
Pericles, who succeeded Cimon, both in’ the 
government and in the patronage of art, is said 
by Plutarch to have entertained the idea of 
making Athens the capital of federated Greece; 
in this he failed; but his encouragement of such 
men as Phidias and Anaxagoras led the way to 
her acquiring a far more lasting sovereignty 
over a far wider empire. Little. understanding 
the sources of her own greatness, Athens would 
go to war; peace is the interest of a seat of com- 
meree and the arts; but to war she went: yet to 
her whether peace or war mattered not. The

away;—they did but bring fresh triumphs to 
the city of the poet and the sage. There at 
length the swarthy Moor and Spaniard were 
seen to meet the blue-eyed Gaul; and the- 
Cappadocian, late subject to Mithridates, gazed 
without alarm at the haughty conquering Roman. 
Revolution after revolution passed over the face 
of Europe, as well as of Greece, but still she was there,~Athens, the city of the mind, as radiant, as splendid, as delicate, as young, as ever she had been. 
Many a more fruitful coast or isle is washed by the blue Algean, many a spot is there more beautiful or sublime to see, many a territory more ample; but there was one charm in Attica, which in the same perfection was nowhere else. The deep pastures of Areadia, the plain of Argos, the Thessalian Vale, these had not the . gift; Bootia, which lay to its immediate north, was notorious for the very want of it. Tha heavy atmosphere of that Beotia might be good for vegetation, but it was associated in popular belief with the dulness of the Beotian intellect; on the contrary, the special purity, elasticity, clearness, and salubrity of the air of Attica, fit concomitant and emblem of its genius, did that for it which earth did not;—it brought out every bright line and tender shade of the land- seape over which it was spread, and would have illuminated the face even of a more barren and rugged eountry.

three prominent mountaing commanding the 
plain —Parnes, Pentelicus, and Hymettus; an 
unsatisfactory soil; some streams, not always 
full;—such is about the report which the agent 
of a London company would have. made: of 
Attica. He would report that the climate 
was mild, the hills were limestone; there was 
plenty of good marble; more pasture than at 
first survey might have been expected, sufficient 
certainly for sheep and goats; fisheries produc- 
tive; silver mines once, but long since worked 
out; figs, fair; oil, first-rate; olives in profusion. 
But what he would not think of noting down was, 
that that olive-tree was so choice in nature 
and sd noble in shape, that it excited a reli- 
gious veneration, and that it took so kindly 
to the light soil as to expand into woods 
upon the open plain, and to climb up and fringe 
the hills. He would not think of writing word 
to his employer, how that clear air, of which I 
have spoken, brought out, yet blended and sub- 
dued, the colors on the marble, till they had a 
softness and harmony, for all their richness, 
which in a picture looks exaggerated, yet is after 
all within the truth. He would not tell how 
that same delicate and brilliant atmosphere 
freshened up the pale olive, until the olive for- 
got its monotony, and its cheek glowed like the 
arbutus or beech of the Umbrian Hills. He 
would say nothing of the thyme and thousand 
fragrant herbs which carpeted Hymettus; he 
would hear nothing of the hum of its bees, nor 
take much account of the rare flavor of its 
honey, since Sozo and Minorca were sufficient 
for the English demand.

height he had aseended; he would follow with 
his eye the chain of islands, which, starting 
from the Sunian headland, seemed to offer the 
fabled divinities of Attica, when they would 
visit their Ionian cousins, a sort of viaduet 
thereto across the sea; but that fancy would not 
occur to him, nor any admiration of the dark 
violet billows with their white edges down be- 
low; nor of ‘those graceful, fanlike jets of silver 
upon the rocks, which slowly rise aloft like water 
spirits from the deep, then shiver and break,

pear, in a soft mist of foam; nor of the gen- 
tle, incessant heaving and panting of the whole 
liquid plain; nor of the long waves, keeping 
steady time, like a line of soldiery, as they 
resounded upon the hollow shore—he would not deign to notice that restless living element at 
all, except to bless his stars that he was not upon 
it. Nor the distinet detail, nor the refined eolor- ing, nor the graceful outline and roseate golden 
line of the jutting erags, nor the bold shadows

value these matters even at a low figure. Rather 
we must turn for the sympathy we seek to yon pilgrim student, come from a semi-barbarous

shrine, where he might take his fill gazing on those emblems and coruscations of invisible, unoriginate perfection. It was the stranger

  fiery, choking sands, learned at once what a real 
university must be, by coming to understand 
the sort of country which was its suitable home. 
Nor was this all that a university required 
and found in Athens. No one, not even there, 
could live on poetry. If the students at that 
famous place had nothing better than bright 
hues and soothing sounds, they would not have 
been able or disposed to turn their residence 
there to much account. Of course they must 
have the means of living, nay, in a certain sense, 
of enjoyment, if Athens was to be an alma 
mater at the time, or to remain afterward a 
pleasant thought in their memory. And so they 
had: be it recollected Athens was a port and a 
mart of trade, perhaps the first in Greece; and 
strangers were ever flocking to it, whose combat 
was to be with intellectual, not physical diffi- 
culties, and who claimed to have their bodily 
wants supplied that they might be at leisure to 
set about furnishing their minds. 
Now barren as was the soil of Attica, and bare 
the face of the country, yet it had only too many 
resourees for an elegant, nay, luxurious abode 
there. So abundant were the imports of the 
place, that it was a common saying that the 
productions which were found singly elsewhere 
were brought together in Athens. Corn and 
wine, the staple of existence in such a climate, 
came from the islands of the Agean; fine wool 
and carpeting from Asia Minor; slaves, as now, 
from the Euxine; and timber too, and iron and 
brass, from the coasts of the Mediterranean. 
The Athenian did not condescend to manufac- 
tures himself, but encouraged them in others, and

On the upper tier (but apart from the male 
spectators) sat the women, their gay dresses re- 
sembling some gaudy flower-bed; it is needless 
to add that they were the most talkative part 
of the assembly; and many were the looks di- 
rected up to them, especially from the benches 
appropriated to the young and the unmarried 
men. On the lower seats round the arena sat 
the more high-born and wealthy visitors—the 
magistrates and those of senatorial or equestrian 
dignity: the passages which, by corridors at 
the right and left, gave access to these seats, at 
either end of the oval arena, were also the en- 
tranees for the combatants. Strong palings at 
these passages prevented any unwelcome eccen-

arranged that day so happily as usual; indeed, 
from the immense space of the circumference, 
the task was always one of great difficulty and 
art—so much so that it could seldom be adven- 
tured in rough or windy weather. But the 
present day was so remarkably still that there 
seemed to the spectators no exeuse for the awk- 
wardness of the artificers; and when a large 
gap in the back of the awning was still visible, 
from the obstinate refusal of one part of the

of discontent were loud and general.

_ the defect, and vowed bitter vengeance on the 
head of the chief officer of the show, who, 
fretting, puffing, perspiring, busied himself in 
idle orders and unavailing threats.. . 
The hubbub ceased suddenly—the operators 
desisted—the crowd were stilled—the gap was 
forgotten—for now, with a loud and warlike 
flourish of trumpets, the gladiators, marshaled 
in ceremonious procession, entered the arena. 
They swept round the oval space very slowly 
and deliberately, in order to give the spectators 
full leisure to admire their stern serénity of 
feature—their brawny limbs and various arms, 
as well as to form such wagers as the excite- 
ment of the moment might suggest. 
‘Oh!’ eried the widow Fulvia to the wife of 
Pansa, as they leaned down from their lofty 
bench, ‘‘do you see that gigantic gladiator? how 
drolly he is drest!’” 
“*Yes,’’ said the edile’s wife with compla- . 
eent importance, for she knew all the names 
and qualities of each combatant: ‘‘he is a 
retiarius or netter; he is armed only, you see, 
with a three-pronged spear like a trident, and a 
net; he wears no armor, only the fillet and the 
tunie. He is a mighty man, and is to fight with 
Sporus, yon thick-set gladiator, with the round 
shield and drawn sword but without body armor; 
he has not his helmet on now, in order that you 
may see his face—how fearless it is! By-and-by 
he will fight with his visor down.’’ . . . 
While thus conversing, the first formalities of 
the show were over. To these succeeded a 
feigned combat with wooden swords between the 
various gladiators matched against each other.

Among these the skill of two Roman gladiator 
hired for the occasion, was the most admireé 
and next to them the most graceful combatar 
was Lydon. This sham contest did not la: 
above an hour, nor did it atiract any very livel 
interest except among those connoisseurs of th 
arena to whom art was preferable to more coar: 
excitement; the body of the speetators were rt 
joiced when it was over, and when the sympath 
rose to terror. The combatants were no 
arranged in pairs, as agreed beforehand; the: 
weapons examined; and the grave sports of th 
day commenced anid the deepest silence—broke 
only by the exciting and preliminary blast « 
warlike music. 
It was often customary to begin the sports b 
the most eruel of all; and some bestiarius, © 
gladiator appointed to the beasts, was slain fix: 
as an initiatory sacrifice. But in the present ix 
stance the experienced Pansa thought betti 
. that the sanguinary drama should advance, nc. 
decrease, in interest; and accordingly the exe- 
eution of Olinthus and Glaucus was reserved for 
the last. It was arranged that the two horse- 
men should first oeeupy the arena; that the foot 
gladiators, paired off, should then be loosed in- 
discriminately on the stage; that Glaucus and the 
lion should next. perform their part in the bloody 
spectacle; and the tiger and ‘the Nazarene be 
the grand finale. And in the spectacles of 
Pompeii, the reader of Roman history must limit 
his imagination, nor expect to find those vast and 
wholesale exhibitions of magnificent slaughter 
with which a Nero or a Caligula regaled the in- 
habitants of the Imperial City. The Roman

  shows, which absorbed the more celebrated 
gladiators and the chief proportion of foreign 
beasts, were indeed the very reason why in the 
lesser towns of the empire the sports of the 
amphitheater were comparatively humane and 
rare; and in this as in other respects, Pompeii , 
was the miniature, the microcosm of Rome. 
Still, it was an awful and imposing spectacle, 
with which modern times have, happily, nothing 
to compare; a vast theater, rising row upon row, 
and swarming with human beings, from fifteen 
to eighteen thousand in number, intent upon no 
fictitious representation—no tragedy of the stage 
—but the actual victory or defeat, the exultant 
life or the bloody death, of each and all who 
entered the arena! 
The two horsemen were now at either ex- 
tremity of the lists (if so they might be called), 
and at a given signal from Pansa the com- 
batants started simultaneously as in full 
collision, each advancing his round buckler, each 
posing on high his sturdy javelin; but just when 
within three paces of his opponent, the steed of 
Berbix suddenly halted, wheeled round, and as 
Nobilior was borne rapidly by, his antagonist 
spurred upon him. The buckler of Nobilior, quick- 
ly and skilfully extended, received a blow which 
otherwise would have been fata). And the wild 
murmur, swelled by many a shout, echoed from 
side to side. 
The visors of both the horsemen were com- 
pletely closed (like those of the knights in after 
times), but the head was nevertheless the great 
point of assault; and Nobilior, now wheeling his 
charger with no less adroitness than his oppo- 
25
-P-A-G-E-39

  nent, directed his spear full on the helmet of 
his foe. Berbix raised his buekler to shield 
himself, and his quick-eyed antagonist, suddenly 
lowering his weapon, pierced him through the 
breast. Berbix reeled and fell. 
‘*Nobilior |. Nobilior!’’ shouted the populace. 
‘*T have lost ten sestertia,’’ said Clodius, be- 
tween bis teeth. 
“‘Habet!’’ (he has it) said Pansa deliberately. 
The populace, not yet hardened into cruelty, 
made the signal of mercy: but as the attendants 
of the arena approached, they found the kind- 
ness came too late; the heart of the Gaul had 
been pierced, and his eyes were set in death. 
Tt was his life’s blood that flowed so darkly 
over the sand and sawdust of the arena, - 
There were now onthe arena six combatants: 
Niger and his net, matched against Sporus with 
his shield and his short broad-sword; Lydon and 
Tetraides, naked save by a cincture round the 
waist, each armed only with a heavy Greek 
cestus; and two gladiators from Rome, clad in 
complete steel, and evenly matched with im- 
mense bucklers and pointed swords. 
The initiatory contest between Lydon and 
Tetraides being less deadly than that between 
the other combatants, no sooner had they ad- 
vaneed to the middie of the arena than as by 
common consent the rest held back, to see how 
that eontest should be decided, and wait till 
fiereer weapons might replace the cestus ere 
they themselves commenced hostilities. They 
stood leaning on their arms and apart from each 
other, gazing on the show, which, if not bloody 
enough thoroughly to please the populace, they 
26 
   
-P-A-G-E-40

  were still inclined to admire because its origin 
was of their ancestral Greece. 
No persons could at first glance have seemed 
less evenly matched than the two antagonists. 
Tetraides, tho no taller than Lydon, weighed con- 
siderably more; the natural size of his muscles 
was increased, to the eyes of the vulgar, by 
masses of solid flesh; for, as it was a notion 
that the eontest-of the ecestus fared easiest with 
him who was plumpest, Tetraides had encouraged 
to the utmost his hereditary predisposition to the 
portly. His shoulders were vast, and his lower 
limbs thick-set, double-jointed, and_ slightly 
eurved outward, in that formation whieh takes 
so much from beauty to give so largely to 
strength. But Lydon, except that he was slender 
even almost to meagerness, was beautifully _ 
and delicately proportioned; and the skilful 
might have perceived that with much less com- 
pass of muscle than his foe, that which he had 
was more seasoned—iron and compact. In pro- 
portion, too, as he wanted flesh, he was likely 
to possess activity; and a haughty smile on his 
resolute face, which strongly contrasted with 
the solid heaviness of his enemy’s, gave assur-~ 
ance to those who beheld it and united their 
hope to their pity; so that despite the disparity 
of their seeming strength, the cry of the multi- 
tude was nearly as loud for Lydon as for Tet- 
raides. 
Whoever is acquainted with the modern prize- 
ring—whoever has witnessed the beavy and 
disabling strokes which the human fist, skil- 
fully direeted, hath the power to bestow—may 
easily understand how much that happy facility 
27
-P-A-G-E-41
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD'S CLASSICS 
  would be increased by a band carried by thongs 
of leather round the arm as high as the elbow, 
and terribly strengthened about the knuckles by 
a plate of iron, and sometimes a plummet of lead. 
Yet this, which was meant to increase, per- 
‘haps rather diminished, the interest of the fray; 
for it necessarily shortened its duration. A 
very few blows, successfully and scientifically 
planted, might suffice to bring the contest to a 
elose; and the battle did not, therefore, often 
allow full seope for the energy, fortitude, and 
dogged perseverance that we technically style 
pluck, which not unusually wins the day against 
superior science, and which heightens to so 
painful a delight the interest in the battle and 
the sympathy for the brave. 
Tetraides struck—it was as the blow of a 
smith on a vise; Lydon sank suddenly on one 
knee—the blow .passed over his head. Not so 
harmless was Lydon’s retaliation; he quickly 
sprang to his feet, and aimed his cestus full on 
the broad chest of his antagonist. Tetraides 
reeled—the populace shouted, . . . 
The people had been already rendered savage 
by the exhibition of blood; they thirsted for 
more; their superstition was aided by their 
ferocity. Aroused, inflamed by the spectacle of 
their victims, they forgot the authority of their 
rulers. It was one of those dread popular con- 
vulsions common to crowds wholly ignorant, half 
free and half servile, and which the peculiar 
constitution of the Roman provinces so frequently 
exhibited. The power of the pretor was a reed 
beneath the whirlwind; still, at his word the 
guards had drawn themselves along the lower

  benches, on which the upper classes sat sepa- 
rate from the vulgar. They made but a feeble 
barrier; the waves of the human sea halted for 
a moment, to enable Arbacus to count the exact 
moment of his doom! In despair, and in a terror 
which beat down even pride, he glanced his eye 
over the rolling and rushing crowd; when, right 
above them, through the wide chasm which had 
been left in the velaria, he beheld a strange and 
awful apparition; he beheld, and his craft re- 
stored his courage! 
He stretched his hand on high; over his lofty 
brow and royal features there came an expres- 
sion of unutterable solemnity and command. 
‘*Behold!’’ he roared with a voice of thunder, 
which stilled the roar of the crowd: ‘‘behold how 
the gods protect the guiltless! The fires of the 
avenging Orcus burst forth against the false 
witness of my aceusers!’’ 
The eyes of the crowd followed the gesture of 
the Egyptian, and beheld with dismay a vast 
vapor shooting from the summit of Vesuvius in 
the form of a gigantic pine-tree; the trunk, 
blackness—the breaches fire!—a fire that shifted 
and wavered in its hues with every moment, 
now fiercely luminous, now of a dull and dying 
red, that again blazed terrifically forth with in- 
tolerable glare! 
There was a dead, heart-sunken silence; 
through which there suddenly broke the roar of 
the lion, which was echoed back from within the 
building by the sharper and fiercer yells of its 
fellow beasts. Dread seers were they of the Bur- 
den of the Atmosphere, and wild prophets of the 
wrath to come!

Then there arose on high the universal shrieks 
of women; the men stared at each other, but were 
dumb. ‘At that moment they felt the earth shake 
under their feet; the walls of the theater trem- 
bled; and beyond in the distance they heard the 
erash of falling roofs; an instant more, and the 
mountain cloud seemed to roll toward them, 
dark and rapid, like a torrent; at the same time 
it east forth from its bosom a shower of ashes 
mixt with vast fragments of burning stone! Over 
the crushing vives, over the desolate streets, over 
the amphitheater itself; far and wide, with many 
a mighty splash in the agitated sea, fell that 
awful shower! 
No longer thought the crowd of justice or of 
Arbaces; safety for themselves was their sole 
thought. Each turned to fly—each dashing, 
pressing, crushing against the other. Trampling 
recklessly over the fallen, amid groans and oaths 
and prayers and sudden shrieks, the enormous 
erowd vomited itself forth through the numer- 
ous passages. Whither should they fly? Some, 
anticipating a second earthquake, hastened to 
their homes to load themselves with their more 
costly goods and escape while it was yet time; 
others, dreading the showers of ashes that now 
fell fast, torrent upon torrent, over the streets, 
rushed under the roofs of the nearest houses, or 
temples, or sheds—shelter of any kind—for pro- 
tection from the terrors of the open air. But

JERUSALEM BY MOONLIGHT* 
Tue broad moon lingers on the summit of 
Mount Olivet, but its beam has long left the 
garden of Gethsemane and the tomb of Absalom, 
the waters of Kedron and the dark abyss of 
Jehoshaphat. Full falls its splendor, however, 
on the opposite city, vivid and defined in its 
silver blaze. A lofty wall, with turrets and 
towers, and frequent gates, undulates with the 
unequal ground which it covers, as it encireles 
the lost capital of Jehovah. It is a city of hills 
far more famous than those of Rome: for all 
Europe has heard of Zion and of. Calvary, while 
the Arab and the Assyrian, and the tribes and 
nations beyond, are as ignorant of the Capitoline 
and Aventine mounts as they are of the Malvern

the gorgeous temple of the God of Abraham, but, 
built, alas! by the child of Hagar, and not by 
Sarah’s chosen one; close to its cedars and its 
eypresses, its lofty spires and airy arches, the 
moonlight falls upon Bethesda’s pool; further 
on, entered by the gate of St. Stephen, the eye, 
tho ’tis the noon of night, traces with ease the 
Street of Grief, a long winding ascent to a vast 
eupolaed pile that now covers Calvary—ealled 
the Street of Grief, because there the most 
illustrious of the human, as well as of the Hebrew 
race, the descendant of King David, and the 
divine son of the most favored of women, twice 
sank under that burden of suffering and shame 
which is now throughout all Christendom the 
emblem of triumph and of honor; passing over 
groups and masses .f houses built of stone, with 
terraced roofs, or surmounted with small domes, 
.We reach the hill of Salem, where Melchisedek 
built his mystic citadel; and still remains the 
hill of Seopas, where Titus gazed upon Jerusalem 
on the eve of his final assault. Titus destroyed 
the temple. The religion of Judea has in turn 
subverted the fanes which were raised to his 
father and to bimself in their imperial capital; 
and the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob 
is now worshiped before every altar in Rome. 
Jerusalem by moonlight! ’Tis a fine spectacle, 
apart from all its indissoluble associations of 
awe and beauty. The mitigating hour softens the

their rocky glens, the gleams of a distant and

The moon has sunk behind the Mount of 
Olives, and the stars in the darker sky shine 
doubly bright over the sacred city. The all- 
prevailing stillness is broken by a breeze, that 
seems to have traveled over the plain of Sharon

The last light is extinguished in the village of 
Bethany. The wailing breeze has become a moan-

sky; the stars are veiled, the stars are hid; 
all becomes as dark as the waters of Kedron 
and valley of Jehoshaphat. The tower of David 
merges into obscurity; no longer glitter the 
minarets of the mosque of Omar; Bethesda’s 
angelic waters, the gate of Stephen, the street 
of sacred sorrow, the hill of Salem, and the 
heights of Scopas can no longer be discerned. 
Alone in the inereasing darkness, while the very 
line of the walls gradually eludes the eye, the 
ehureh of the Holy Sepulcher is a beaeon-light. 
And why is the church of the Holy Sepuicher 
a beacon-light? Why, when it is already past

in Jerusalem, and not a sound disturbs the deep

  fections and blemishes on his person; but: he 
could not disguise all the infirmities under which 
he labored; the weakness of the forefinger of 
his right hand and a lameness in the left hip 
were the results of wounds he incurred in a battle 
with the Iapyde in early life; he suffered re- 
peated attacks of fever of the most serious kind, 
especially in the course of the campaign of 
Philippi and that against the Cantabrians, and 
again two years afterward at Rome, when his 
recovery was despaired of. From that time, altho 
constantly liable to be affected by cold and heat, 
and obliged to nurse himself throughout with 
the care of a valetudinarian, he does not appear 
to have had any return of illness so serious as the 
preceding; and dying at the age of seventy-four, 
the rumor obtained popular currency that he 
was prematurely eut off by poison administered 
by the empress. - 
As the natural consequence of this bodily 
weakness and sickly constitution, Octavian did 
not attempt to distinguish himself by active 
exertions or feats of personal prowess. The 
splendid examples of his uncle the dictator, and 
of Antonius* his rival, might have early dis- 
couraged him from attempting to shine as a 
warrior and hero; he had not the vivacity and 
animal spirits necessary to carry him through 
such exploits as theirs; and, altho he did not 
shrink from exposing himself to personal danger, 
he prudently declined to allow a comparison to 
to be instituted between himself and rivals whom 
he could. not hope to equal. Thus necessarily

own life, and afterward to obtain the splendid 
prizes which had hitherto been carried off by 
daring adventure, and the good fortune which is 
so often its attendant. His contest therefore with 
Antonius and Sextus Pompeius was the contest 
of cunning with bravery; but from his youth up- 
ward he was accustomed to overreach, not the 
bold and reckless only, but the most considerate 
and wily of his contemporaries, such as Cicero 
and Cleopatra; he sueceeded in the end in de- 
luding the senate and people of Rome in the 
establishment of his tyranny; and finally deceived 
the expectations of the world, and falsified the 
lessons of the republican history, in reigning 
himself forty years in disguise, and leaving a 
throne to be claimed without challenge by his 
suceessors for fourteen centuries. 
But altho emperor in name, and in fact abso- 
lute master of his people, the manners of the 
Cesar, both in public and private life, were still 
those of a simple citizen. On the most solemn 
oceasions he was distinguished by no other dress 
than the robes and insignia of the offices which 
he exercised; he was attended by no other guards 
than those which his consular dignity rendered 
customary and decent. In his court there was 
none of the etiquette of modern monarchies to 
be recognized, and it was only by slow and | 
gradual encroachment that it came to prevail in 
that of his successors. Augustus was contented to 
take up his residence in the house which had be- 
longed to the orator Licinius Calvus, in the neigh- ; 
borhood of the Forum; which he afterward aban- 
doned for that of Hortensius on the Palatine,

markable neither for size nor splendor. Its 
halls were small, and lined, not with marble, after 
the luxurious fashion of many patrician palaces, 
but with the common Alban stone, and the 
pattern of the pavement was plain and simple. 
Nor when he succeeded Lepidus in the pontificate 
would he relinquish this private dwelling for the 
regia or public residence assigned that honorable 
office. 
Many anecdotes are recorded of the modera- 
tion with which the emperor received the oppo- 
sition, and often the rebukes, of individuals in 
public as well as in private. These stories are 
not without their importance, as showing ‘how 
little formality there was in the tone of address- 
ing the master of the Roman world, and how entirely different the ideas of the nation were, 
with regard to the position occupied by the 
Casar and his family from those with which 
modern associations have imbued us. We have 
already noticed the rude freedom with which 
Tiberius was attacked, altho step-son of the 
emperor, and participating in the eminent func- 
tions of the tribunitian power, by a declaimer in 
the schools at Rhodes: but Augustus himself 
seems to have suffered almost as much as any 
private citizen from the general coarseness of 
behavior which characterized the Romans in 
their public assemblies, and the rebukes to which 
he patiently submitted were frequently such as 
would lay the courtier of a constitutional 
sovereign in modern Europe under perpetual dis-

WAR? 
Looxixe back upon the troubles which ended 
in the outbreak of war, one sees the nations at 
first swaying backward and forward like a throng 
so vast as to be helpless, but afterward falling 
slowly into warlike array. And when one be- 
gins to search for the man or the men whose 
volition was governing the crowd, the eye falls 
upon the towering form of the Emperor Nicholas. 
He was not single-minded, and therefore his will 
was unstable, but it had a huge force; and, since 
he was armed with the whole authority of his 
empire, it seemed plain that it was this man 
~—and only he—who was bringing danger from 
the north. And at first, too, it seemed that 
within his range of action there was none who 
eould be his equal: but in a little while the looks 
of men were turned to the Bosporus, for thither 
his ancient adversary was slowly bending his 
way. . 
To fit him for the encounter, the Englishman 
was clothed with little authority except what he 
eould draw from the resources of his own mind 
and from the strength of his own wilful nature.

soon it appeared that, the he moved gently, he 
began to have mastery over a foe who was con-

had conquered, he stood, as it were, with folded

But also in the west there had been seen a knot

to be able to keep their hold, and to shelter them- 
selves from a cruel fate. The volitions of these 
men were active enough, because they were 
toiling for their lives. Their efforts seemed to 
interest and to please the lustiest man of those 
days, for he watched them from over the Channel

ON VARIATIONS IN MAMMALS, BIRDS AND FISHES* 
Nor only the various domestic races, but the 
most distinct genera and orders within the same 
great class—for instance, mammals, birds, rep- 
tiles, and fishes—are all the descendants of one 
eommon progenitor, and we must admit that the 
whole vast amount of difference between these 
forms has primarily arisen from simple vari- 
ability. To consider the subject under this point 
of view is enough to strike one dumb with amaze- 
ment. But our amazement ought to be lessened 
when we reflect that beings almost infinite in 
number, during an almost infinite lapse of time, 
have often had their whole organization rendered 
in some degree plastic, and that each slight modi- 
fication of structure which was in any way benefi- 
cial under excessively complex conditions. of life 
has been preserved, while each which was in any

  way injurious has been rigorously destroyed. And 
the long-continued accumulation of beneficial 
variations will infallibly have led to structures as 
diversified, as beautifully adapted for various 
purposes, and as excellently coordinated as we 
see in the animals and plants around us. Hence 
I have spoken of selection as the paramount 
power, whether applied by man to the formation 
of domestic breeds, or by nature to the production 
of species. If an architect were to rear a noble 
and commodious edifice without the use of cut 
stone, by selecting from the fragments at the base 
of a precipice wedge-formed stones for his arches, 
elongated stones for his lintels, and fat stones for 
his roof, we should admire his skill, and regard 
him as the paramount power. Now, the frag- 
ments of stone, tho indispensable to the architect, 
bear to the edifice built by him the same relation 
which the fluctuating variations of organie beings 
bear to the varied and admirable structures ul- 
timately acquired by their modified descendants. 
Some authors have declared that natural selec- 
tion explains nothing, unless the precise cause of 
each slight individual difference be made clear. 
If it were explained td a savage utterly ignorant 
of the art of building how the edifice had been 
raised stone upon stone, and why wedge-formed 
fragments were used for the arches, flat’ stones 
for the roof, ete.; and if the use of each part 
and of the whole building were pointed out, it 
would be unreasonable if he declared that nothing 
had been made clear to him, because the precise 
cause of the shape of each fragment eould not 
be told. But this is a nearly parallel case with 
the objection that selection explains nothing, be- 
48
-P-A-G-E-62
  CHARLES DARWIN 
  cause we know not the cause of each individual 
difference in the structure of each being. 
The shape of the fragments of stone at the 
base of our precipice may be called accidental, 
but this is not strictly correct; for the shape of 
each depends on a long sequenee of events, all 
obeying natural laws; on the nature of the rock, 
on the lines of deposition or cleavage, on the form 
of the mountain, which depends on its upheaval 
and subsequent denudation, and lastly on the 
storm or earthquake which throws down the frag- 
ments. But in regard to the use to which the 
fragments may be put, their shape may be strictly 
said to be aceidental. And here we are led 
to face a great difficulty, in alluding to which 
I am aware I am traveling beyond my proper . 
provinee. An omniscient Creator must have fore- 
seen every consequence which results from the 
laws imposed by Him. 
But can it reasonably be maintained that the 
Creator intentionally ordered, if we use the words 
ip any ordinary sense, that certain fragments of 
rock should assume certain shapes so that the 
builder might erect his edifice? If the various 
laws which have determined the shape of each 
fragment were not predetermined for the build- 
er’s sake, can it be maintained with any greater 
probability that He specially ordained for the 
sake of the breeder each of the innumerable 
variations in our domestic animals and plants; 
many of these variations being of no service to 
man, and not beneficial, far more often injurious, 
to the creatures themselves? Did he ordain that 
the crop and tail-feathers of the pigeon should 
vary in order that the fancier might make his 
VI-4 49
-P-A-G-E-63
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  grotesque pouter and fantail breeds? Did He 
cause the frame and mental qualities of the dog 
to vary in order that a breed might be formed 
of indomitable ferocity, with jaws fitted to pin 
down the bull for man’s brutal sport? But if 
we give up the principle in one case—if we do 
not admit that the variations of the primeval 
dog were intentionally guided in order that the 
greyhound, for instance, that perfect image of 
symmetry and vigor, might be formed-—no shadow 
of reason can be assigned for the belief that 
variations, alike in nature and the result of the 
same general laws, which have been the ground- 
work through natural selection of the formation 
of the most perfectly adapted animals in the 
world, man ineluded, were intentionally and spe- 
eially guided. However much we may wish it, 
we ean hardly follow Professor Asa Gray in his 
belief, ‘‘that variation has been led along certain 
‘beneficial lines of irrigation.’’ If we assume that 
each particular variation was from the beginning 
of all time preordained, then that plasticity of 
organization which leads to many injurious devia- 
tions of structure, as well as the redundant power 
of reproduction which inevitably leads to a strug- 
gle for existence, and as a consequence, to the 
natural selection or survival of the fittest, must 
appear to us superfluous laws of nature. .On the 
other hand, an omnipotent and omniscient Crea- 
- tor ordains everything and foresees everything. 
Thus we are brought face to face with a difficulty 
as insoluble as is that of free will and pre- 
destination.

South American character of most of the produc- 
tions of the Galapagos Archipelago, and more 
especially by the manner in which they differ 
slightly on each island of the group; none of 
the islands appearing to be very ancient in a 
geological sense. . 
It was evident that such facts as these, as well 
as many others, could only be explained on the 
supposition that species gradually become modi- 
fied; and the subject haunted me. But it was 
equally evident that neither the action of the 
surrounding conditions, nor the will of the or- 
ganisms (especially in the case of plants), could 
account for the innumerable cases in which or- 
ganisms of every kind are beautifully adapted 
to their habits of life; for instance, a woodpecker 
or a tree-frog to climb trees, or a seed for dis- 
persal by hooks or plumes. I had always been 
much struck by such adaptations, and until these

could be explained it seemed to me almost useless 
to. endeavor to prove by indirect evidence that 
species have been modified. 
After my return to England it appeared to me 
that by following the example of Lyell in geo- 
logy, and by collecting all facts which bore in 
any way on the variation of animals and plants 
under domestication and nature, some light might 
perhaps be thrown on the whole subject. My 
first notebook was opened in July, 1837. I 
worked on true Baconian principles; and without 
any theory collected facts on a wholesale scale, 
more especially with respect to domesticated pro- 
ductions, by printed inquiries, by conversation 
with skilful breeders and gardeners, and by ex- 
tensive reading. When I see the list of books 
of all kinds which I read and abstracted, in- 
eluding whole series of Journals and Transactions, 
I am surprized at my industry. I soon perceived 
that selection was the keystone of man’s success 
in making useful races of animals and plants. 
But how selection could be applied to organisms 
living in a state of nature, remained for some 
time a mystery to me. 
In October, 1838—that is, fifteen months after 
I had begun my systematic inquiry—I happened 
to read for amusement ‘‘Malthus on Popula- 
tion’’; and being well prepared to appreciate 
the struggle for existence which everywhere goes 
on from long-continued observation of the habits 
of animals and plants, it at once struck me that 
under these circumstances favorable variations 
would tend to be preserved, and unfavorable ones 
to be destroyed. The result of this would be the 
formation of new species. Here then I had at

last got a theory by which to work; but I was 
so anxious to avoid prejudice that I determined 
not for some time to write even the briefest 
sketch of it. In June, 1842, I first allowed myself 
the satisfaction of writing a very brief abstract 
of my theory in pencil in thirty-five pages; and 
this was enlarged during the summer of 1844 into 
one of two hundred and thirty pages, which I 
had fairly copied out and still possess. 
But at that time I overlooked one problem of 
great importance; and it is astonishing to me, 
except on the principle of Columbus and his egg, 
how J could have overlooked it and its solution. 
This problem is the tendency in organic beings 
descended from the same stock to diverge in char- 
acter as they become modified. That they have 
diverged greatly is obvious from the manner in 
which species of all kinds can be classed under 
genera, genera under families, families under sub- 
orders, and so forth: and I can remember the 
very spot in the road, while in my carriage, when 
to my joy the solution occurred to me; and this 
was long after I had come to Down. The solu- 
tion, as I believe, is that the modified offspring’ 
of all dominant and increasing forms tend to 
become adapted to many and highly diversified 
places in the economy of nature. 
Early in 1856 Lyell advised me to write out 
my views pretty fully, and I began at once to 
do so on a scale three or four times as extensive 
as that which was afterward followed in my 
*<Origin of Species’’; yet it was only an abstract 
of the materials which I had eollected, and I got 
through about half the work on this scale. But 
my plans were overthrown, for early in the sum-

  mer of 1858 Mr. Wallace, who was then in the 
Malay Archipelago, sent me an essay ‘‘On’ the 
Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely 
from the Original Type’’; and this essay. eon- 
tained exactly the same theory as mine. Mr. 
Wallace’ exprest the wish that if I thought ‘well 
of his essay, I should send it to Lyell for perusal. 
The circumstances under which I consented, at 
the request of Lyell and Hooker, to allow of. an 
abstract from my MS., together with .a letter to 
Asa Gray dated September 5th, 1857, to be pub- 
lished at the same time with Wallace’s essay, are 
given in the ‘‘Journal of the Proceedings of the 
Linnean Society,’’ 1858, page 45, I was at first 
very unwilling to consent, as I thought: Mr. 
Wallace might consider my doing so unjustifiable, 
for I did not then know how generous and noble 
was his disposition. The extract from my MS. 
and the letter to Asa Gray had neither been in- 
tended for publication, and were badly written. 
Mr. Wallace’s essay, on the other hand, was ad- 
mirabl:- exprest and quite clear. Nevertheless, 
our joint productions excited very little attention, 
and the only published notice of them which I 
ean remember was by Professor Haughton of 
Dublin, whose verdict was that all that was new 
in them was false, and what was true was old. 
This shows how necessary it is that any new 
view should be explained at considerable length 
in order to arouse public attention. . . « 
My habits are methodical, and this has been 
of not a little use for my particular line of work. 
Lastly, I have had ample leisure from not having 
to earn my own bread. Even ill health, tho it 
has annibilated several years of my life, has

amusement. 
Therefore my success as @ man of science, 
whatever this may have amounted to, has been 
determined as far as I ean judge by. complex and 
diversified mental qualities and éonditions. Of 
these, the most important have been the love of 
science, unbounded patience in long reflecting 
over any subject, industry in observing and col- 
lecting facts, and a fair share of invention as 
well as of common sense. With such moderate 
abilities as I possess, it is truly surprizing that 
I should have influenced to a considerable extent 
the belief of scientific men on some important 
points.

Born in 1810, died in 1882; son of a Biblical scholar of

RAB AND THE GAME CHICKEN* 
Four-aND-THIRTY years ago Bob Ainslie and 
I were coming up Infirmary Street from the 
Edinburgh High School, our heads together, and 
our arms intertwisted, as only lovers and boys 
know how, or why. 
When we got to the top of the street, and 
turned north, we espied a crowd at the Tron 
Chureh. ‘‘A dog fight!’’ shouted Bob, and was 
off; and so was I, both of us all but praying that 
it might not be over before we got up! And is 
not this boy-nature? and human nature too? and 
don’t we all wish a house on fire not to be out 
before we see it? Dogs like fighting; old Isaac 
says they ‘‘delight’’ in it, and for the best of all 
reasons; and boys are not eruel because théy like 
to see the fight. They see three of the great 
cardinal virtues of dog or man—courage, en- 
duranece, and skill—in intense action. This is 
very different from a love of making dogs fight, 
and enjoying, and aggravating, and making gain

  by their pluck. A boy, be he ever so fond him- 
self of fighting, if he be a good boy, hates and 
despises all this, but he would have ren off with 
Bob and me fast enough; it is a natural, and a 
not wicked interest, that all boys and men have. . 
in witnessing intense energy in action. 
Does any eurious and. finely ignorant woman 
wish to know how Bob’s eye at a glance an- 
nounced a dog fight to his brain? He did not, 
he could not-see the dogs fighting; it was a flash 
of an inference, a rapid'induction. The crowd 
round a couple of dogs fighting is.a crowd mas- 
culine mainly, with.an ‘occasional active, com- 
passionate woman, fluttering wildly round the 
outside, and using her tongue and her hands 
freely upon the men, as so many ‘‘brutes’’; it 
is a crowd annular, compact, and mobile; a crowd 
centripetal, having its eyes and its heads all bent 
downward and inward to one common focus. 
Well, Bob and I are up, and find it is not over; 
a small, thoroughbred, white bull-terrier is busy 
throttling a large shepherd’s dog, unaccustomed 
to war, but not to be trifled with. They are hard 
at it; the scientifie little fellow doing his work 
in great style, his pastoral enemy fighting wildly, 
but with the sharpest of teeth and a great cour- 
age. Science and breeding, however, soon had 
their own; the Game Chicken, as the premature 
Bob ealled him, working his way up, took his final 
grip of poor Yarrow’s throat—and he lay gasping 
and done for. His master, a brown, handsome, 
big young shepherd from Tweedsmuir, would have 
liked to have knocked down any man, would 
‘‘drink up Esil, or eat a crocodile,’’ for that 
part, if he had a chance: it was no use kicking

  the little dog; that would only make him‘ hold 
the closer. Many were the means shouted out in 
mouthfuls, of the best possible ways of ending 
it. ‘‘Water!’’ but ‘there was none near, and 
many cried for it who might have got it from 
the well at Blackfriars Wynd.  ‘‘Bite the taill’? 
and a large, vague, benevolent, middle-aged man, 
more desirous than wise, with some struggle got 
the bushy end of Yarrow’s tail into his ample 
mouth, and bit it with all his might. This was 
more than enough for the much-enduring, much- 
perspiring shepherd, who, with a gleam of joy 
over his broad visage, delivered a terrific facer 
upon our large, benevolent, middle-aged friend— 
who went down like a shot. . 
Still the Chicken holds; death not far. off. 
**Snuff! a pinch of snuff!’’ observed a calm, 
highly-drest young buek, with an eyeglass. in. his 
eye. ‘‘Snuff, indeed!’’ growled the angry crowd, 
affronted and glaring. ‘‘Snuff! a pinch of 
snuff!’’ again observes the buck, but with more 
urgency; whereon were produced several open 
boxes, and from a mull which may have been at 
Culloden, be took a pinch, knelt down, and pre- 
sented it to the nose of the Chicken. The laws 
of physiology and of snuff take their course; the 
Chicken sneezes, and Yarrow is free! _ 
The young pastoral giant stalks off with Yar- 
row in his arms—comforting him. 
But the bull terrier’s blood is up, and his soul 
unsatisfied; he grips the first dog he meets, and 
discovering she is not a dog, in Homeric phrase, 
he makes a brief sort of amende, and is off. The 
boys, with Bob and me at their head, are after 
him: down Niddry Street he goes bent on mis-

  -chief; up the Cowgate like an arrow—Bob and I, 
and our small men ‘panting behind. : 
There, under the single arch of the South 
Bridge, is a huge mastiff, sauntering down the 
middle of the causeway, as if with his hands in 
his pockets; he is old, gray, brindled, as big. as 
a little Highland bull, and has the Shakespearean 
dewlaps shaking as he goes. : 
The Chicken makes straight at him and fastens . 
on his throat. To our astonishment, the great 
creature does nothing but stand still, hold himself 
up and roar—yes, roar; a long, serious, remon- 
strative roar. How: is ‘this?’ Bob and I are up 
to them, He is muzzled! The bailies had pro- 
elaimed a general muzzling, and his master, 
studying strength and economy mainly, had en- 
eompassed his huge jaws in a home-made ap- 
paratus constructed out of the leather of some | 
ancient breechin. His mouth was open as far as 
it eould be; his lips curled up in rage—a sort of 
terrible grin; his teeth gleaming, ready, from out 
the darkness; the strap across his mouth tense 
as a bowstring; his whole frame stiff with in- 
dignation and surprize; his roar asking us all 
round, ‘‘Did you ever see the like of this?’’ He 
looked a statue of anger and astonishment done 
in Aberdeen granite. 
We soon had a crowd; the Chicken held on. 
**A knife!’’ cried Bob; and a cobbler gave him 
his knife: you know the kind of knife, worn away 
obliquely to a point, and always keen. I put 
its edge to the tense leather; it ran before it; 
and then!—~one sudden jerk of that enormous 
head, a sort of dirty mist about his mouth, no 
noise—and the bright and fierce little fellow is

dropt, limp and dead. A solemn pause; this was 
more than any of us had bargained for. I turned 
the little fellow over, and saw he was quite dead; 
the mastiff had taken him by the small of the 
back like a rat, and broken it. 
He looked down at his victim appeased, 
ashamed, and amazed; snuffed him ail over, 
stared at him, and taking a sudden thought, 
turned round and trotted off. Bob took the dead 
dog up-and said, ‘‘John, we’ll bury him after 
tea.’? ‘*Yes,’? said I, and was off after the 
mastiff. He made up the Cowgate at rapid 
swing; he had forgotten some engagement. He 
turned up the Candlemaker Row, and stopt at 
the Harrow Inn. 
There was a carrier’s cart ready to start, and 
a keen, thin, impatient, black-a-vised little man, 
his hand at his gray horse’s head, looking about 
angrily for something. . 
“Rab, ye thief!’’ said he, aiming a kick at 
my great friend, who drew eringing up, and 
avoiding the heavy shoe with more agility than 
dignity, and, watching his master’s eye, slunk 
dismayed under the cart—his ears down, and as 
much as he had of tail down too. 
What a man this must be—thought I—to whom 
my tremendous hero turns tail! The carrier saw 
the muzzle hanging, eut and useless, from his 
neck, and I eagerly told him the story, which 
Bob and I always thought, and still think, Homer 
or King David or Sir Walter alone were worthy 
to rehearse. The severe little man was mitigated, 
and condescended to say, ‘‘Rab, my man, puir 
Rabbie’’—whereupon the stump of a tail rose 
up, the ears were cocked, the eyes filled, and were

‘‘Hupp!’’ and a stroke of the whip were given 
to Jess; and off went the three. 
Bob and I buried the Game Chicken that night 
(we had not much of a tea) in the back green 
of his house in Melville Street, No. 17, with con- 
siderable gravity and silence; and being at the 
time in the ‘‘Iliad,’’ and, like all boys, Trojans. 
we ealled him Hector, of course. :

THE IMPERTURBABLE MARLBOROUGH * 
Axp now, having seen a great military march 
through a friendly country, the pomps and fes- 
tivities of more than one German court, the 
severe struggle of a hotly contested battle, and 
the triumph of victory, Mr. Esmond beheld 
another part of military duty; our troops enter- 
ing the enemy’s territory and putting all around 
them to fire and sword; burning farms, wasted 
fields, shrieking women, slaughtered sons. and 
fathers, and drunken soldiery, cursing and carous- 
ing in the midst of tears, terror, and murder. 
Why does the stately Muse of History, that de- 
lights in describing the valor of heroes and the 
grandeur of conquest, leave out these scenes, 
so brutal, and degrading, that yet form by far 
the greater part of the drama of war? You

  triumph with which our chieftains are bepraised ; 
you pretty maidens that come tumbling down the 
stairs when the fife and drum eall you, and 
huzza for the British Grenadiers;—do you take 
account that these items go to make up the 
amount of triumph you admire, and form part 
of the duties of the heroes you fondle? 
Our ehief, whom England and all Europe, sav- 
ing only the Frenchmen, worshipt almost, had 
this of the god-like in him: that he was impassible 
before victory, before danger, before defeat. Be- 
fore the greatest obstacle or the most trivial 
ceremony; before a hundred thousand men drawn 
in battalia, or a peasant slaughtered at the door 
of his burning hovel; before a carouse of drunken 
German lords, or a monareh ’s court, or a cottage | 
table where his plans were laid, or an enemy’s 
battery, vomiting flame and death and strewing 
eorpses. round about him—he was always cold, 
ealm, resolute, like fate. He performed a treason 
or a court bow, he told a falsehood as black as 
Styx, as easily as he paid a compliment or 
spoke about the weather. He took a mistress and 
left her, he betrayed his benefactor and suppor- 
ted him, or would have murdered him, with the 
same calmness always and having no more re- 
morse than Clotho when she weaves the thread, 
or Lachesis when she cuts it. In the hour of 
battle I have heard the Prince of Savoy’s officers 
say the. prince became possest with a sort of 
warlike fury: his eyes lighted up; he rushed 
hither and thither, raging; shrieked curses and 
encouragement, yelling and harking his bloody 
war-dogs on, and himself always at the first of 
‘the hunt. Our duke was as calm at the mouth of

  a cannon as at the door of a drawing-room. 
Perhaps he could not have been the great man he 
was had he had a heart either for love or hatred, 
or pity or fear, or regret or remorse. He 
achieved the highest deed or daring, or deepest 
ealculation of thought, as he performed the very 
meanest action of which a man is capable; told 
a lie or cheated a fond woman or robbed a poor 
beggar of a halfpenny, with a like awful serenity, 
and equal capacity of the highest and lowest 
aets of our nature. 
His qualities were pretty well known in the 
army, where there were parties of all polities, and 
of plenty of shrewdness and wit; but there ex- 
isted such a perfect confidence in him, as the. first 
captain of the world, and such a faith and ad- 
miration in his prodigious genius and fortune, 
that the very men whom he notoriously cheated 
of their pay, the chiefs whom he used and in- 
jured—for he used all men, great and small, that 
eame near him, as bis instruments alike, and took _ 
something of theirs, either some quality or some 
property: the blood of a soldier, it might be, or 
a jeweled hat or a hundred thousand crowns 
from the king, or a portion out of a starving 
sentinel’s three farthings; or when he was young, 
a kiss from a woman, and the gold chain off her 
neck, taking all he conld from woman or man, 
and having, as I said, this of the godlike in him, 
that he could see a hero perish or a sparrow fall 
with the same amount of sympathy for either. 
Not that he had no tears, he could always 
order up this reserve at the proper moment to 
battle; he could draw upon tears or smiles alike, 
and whenever need was for using this cheap

would flatter a minister or a monarch; be 
haughty, be humble, threaten, repent, weep, grasp 
your hand, or stab you whenever he saw oceasion 
—but yet those of the army who knew him best 
and had suffered most from him, admired him 
most of all; and as he rode along the lines to 
battle, or galloped up in the nick of time to a 
battalion reeling from the enemy’s charge or 
shot, the fainting men and officers got new cour- 
age as they saw the splendid calm of his face, and 
felt that his will made them irresistible. . 
After the great vietory of Blenheim, the en- 
thusiasm of the army for. the: duke, even of his 
bitterest personal enemies in it, amounted to 
a sortrof rage: nay, the very officers who eursed. 
him in their hearts were among the most frantic 
to cheer him. Who could refuse his meed of ad- 
miration to such a victory and such a victor? 
Not he who writes: a man may profess to be 
ever so much a philosopher, but he who fought 
on that day must feel a thrill of pride as he 
reealls it. \

  army in the Low Countries, in 1815, and led it 
dancing and feasting, as it were, up to the very 
brink of battle. A certain ball® which a noble 
duchess gave at Brussels on the 15th of June in 
the above-named year is historical. All Brussels 
had been in a state of excitement about it; and 
- I have heard from ladies who were in that town 
at the period, that the talk and interest of persons 
of their own sex regarding the ball was much 
greater even than in respect of the enemy in 
their front. The struggles, intrigues, and prayers 
to get tickets were such as only English ladies 
will employ, in order to gain admission to the 
society of the great of their own nation. 
Jos and Mrs. O’Dowd, who were panting to be 
asked, strove in vain ‘to procure tickets; but 
others of our friends were more lucky, For 
instance, through the interest of my Lord 
Bareacres, and as a set-off for the dinner at the 
restaurateur’s, George got a card for Captain 
and Mrs. Osborne; which cireumstance greatly 
elated him. Dobbin, who was a friend of the 
general commanding the division in which their 
regiment was, came laughing one day to Mrs. 
Osborne, and displayed a similar invitation; 
which made Jos envious, and George wonder how 
the dence he should be getting into society. Mr. 
and Mrs. Rawdon, finally, were of course invited, 
as became the friends of a general commanding 
a cavalry brigade. 
On the appointed night, George, having com- 
manded new dresses and ornaments of all sorts 
for Amelia, drove to the famous ball, where his

  wife did not know a.single soul. . After looking 
about for Lady Baréacres,—who eut him, think- 
ing the card was quite enough,—and after pla- 
cing Amelia on a bench, he left her to her own 
eogitations there; thinking on his own part that 
he had behaved very handsomely in getting her’ 
new clothes, and bringing her to the bali, where 
she was free to amuse herself as she liked. Her 
thoughts were not the pleasantest, and nobody ex- 
cept honest Dobbin came to disturb them. 
‘Whilst her appearance was an utter failure 
(as her husband felt. with a sort of rage), Mrs. 
Rawdon Crawley’s début was, on the contrary, 
very brilliant. She arrived very late. Her face 
was radiant; her dress perfection. In the midst 
of the great persons assembled, and the eye-. 
glasses directed to her, Rebecea seemed to be as 
cool and collected as when she used to marshak 
Miss Pinkerton’s littie girls to church. Numbers 
of the men she knew already, and the dandies 
thronged around her. As for the ladies, it was 
whispered among them that Rawdon had run 
away with her from out of a convent, and that 
she was a relation of the Montmorency family. 
She spoke French so perfectly that there might be 
some truth in this report, and it was agreed that. 
her manners were fine, and her air distinguished. | 
Fifty would-be partners thronged round her at | 
once, and prest to have the honor to dance with: 
her. But she said she was engaged, and only 
going to dance very little; and made her way at 
once to the place where Emmy sate quite un- 
noticed, and dismally unhappy. 
And so, to finish the poor child at once, Mrs, 
Rawdon ran and greeted affectionately her dear-

est Amelia, and began forthwith to patronize her. 
She found fault with her friend’s dress, and her 
hair-dresser, and wondered how she could be 
So chaussée, and vowed that she must send her 
corsetiére the next morning. She vowed that it 
was a delightful ball; that there was everybody 
that every one knew, and only a very few no- 
bodies in the whole room. It is a fact that in a 
fortnight, and after three dinners in general 
society, this young woman had got up the gen- 
teel jargon so well that a native could not speak 
it better; and it was only from her French be- 
ing so good, that you could know that she was not 
a born woman of fashion. 
George, who had left Emmy on the bench on 
entering the ballroom, very soon found his way 
back when Rebecca was by her dear friend’s side. 
Beeky was just lecturing Mrs. Osborne upon the 
follies which her husband was committing. ‘‘For 
God’s sake, stop him from gambling, my dear,’’ 
she said, ‘‘or he will ruin himself. He and Raw- 
don are playing at cards every night; and you 
know he is very poor, and Rawdon will win every 
shilling from him if he does not take care. Why 
don’t you prevent him, you little careless 
ereature? Why don’t. you come to us of an 
evening, instead of moping’ at home with that 
Captain Dobbin? I dare say he is trés aimable; 
but how can one love a man with feet of such 
size? Your husband’s feet are darlings—here

“now how to wound so. There is a poison on the 
tip of the little shafts which sting a thousand 
times more than a man’s blunter weaponY Our 
poor Emmy, who had never hated, never sneered 
all her life, was powerless in the hands of her 
remorseless little enemy. : 
George danced with Rebecca twice or thrice— 
how many times Amelia searcely knew. She sat 
quite unnoticed in her corner, except when Raw- 
don came up with some words of clumsy eonver- 
sation; and later in the evening, when Captain 
Dobbin made so bold as to bring her refreshments 
and sit beside her. He did not like to ask her 
why she was so sad; but as a’ pretext for the 
tears which were filling her. eyes, she told him 
that Mrs. Crawley. had alarmed her by telling her 
that George would go on playing. 
“It is eurious, when a man is bent upon play, : 
by what clumsy rogues he will allow himself 
to be cheated,’? Dobbin said; and Emmy said 
“Indeed.’? She was thinking of something else. 
It was not the loss of the money that grieved 
her. 
At last George came back for Rebecea’s shawl 
and flowers. She was going away. She did not 
even condescend to come back and say good-by 
to Amelia. The poor girl let her husband come 
and go without saying a word, and her head fell 
on her breast. Dobbin had been called away, 
and was whispering deep in conversation with 
the general of the division, his friend, and had 
not seen this last parting. George went away 
then with the bouquet; but when he gave it to 
the owner, there lay a note, coiled like a snake 
among the flowers. Rebeecca’s eye caught, it at

    ‘once: she had been uséd to deal with notes in 
early life. She put out her hand and took the 
nosegay. He saw by her eyes as they met, that 
‘she was aware what she would find there. Her 
husband hurried her away, still too intent upon 
his own thoughts, seemingly, to take note of any 
marks of recognition which might pass between 
his friend and his wife. These were, however, 
but trifling. Rebecca gave George her hand 
with one of her usual quick knowing glances, 
and made a curtsey and walked away. George 
bowed over the hand; said nothing in reply to 
a remark of Crawley’s,—did not hear it even, 
his. brain was so throbbing with triumph and 
excitement; and allowed them to go away without 
a word. ° 
His wife saw the one part at least of the 
bouquet scene, It was quite natural that George 
should come at Rebecca’s request to get her scarf 
and flowers,—it was no more than he had done 
twenty times before in the course of the last 
few days; but now it was too much for her. 
‘‘William,’? she said, suddenly clinging to 
Dobbin, who was near her, ‘‘you’ve always been 
very kind to me: I’m—I’m not well. Take me 
home.’’ She did not know she called him by 
his Christian name, as George was accustomed to 
do. _He went away with her quickly. Her lodg- 
ings were hard by; and they threaded through 
the crowd without, where everything seemed to 
be more astir than even in the ballroom within. 
George had been angry twice or thrice at 
finding his wife up on his return from the parties 
which he frequented, so she went straight to 
bed now; but altho she did not sleep, and altho

the din and clatter and the galloping of horse- 
men was incessant, she never heard any of these 
noises, having quite other disturbances to keep 
her awake. : 
Osborne meanwhile, wild with elation, went off. 
to a play table and began to bet frantically. He 
won repeatedly. ‘‘Everything succeeds with me 
to-night,’ he said. But his luck at play even 
did not cure kim of his restlessness; and he 
started up after a while, pocketing his winnings, — 
and went off to a buffet, where he drank off 
many bumpers of wine. . 
Here, as he was rattling away to the people 
around him, laughing loudly and wild with spirits, 
Dobbin found him. He had been to the card. 
tables to look there for his friend. . Dobbin looked. 
as pale and grave as his comrade was flushed and 
jovial. 
‘*Hullo, Dob! Come and drink, old Dob! The 
duke’s wine is famous. Give me some more, 
you sir;’’ and he held out a trembling glass for 
the liquor. 
*“Come out, George,’’ said Dobbin, still 
gravely: “‘don’t drink.’’ 
“Drink! there’s nothing like it, Drink your- 
self, and light up your lantern. jaws, old boy. 
Here’s to you.’’ : 
Dobbin went up and whispered something te’ - 
him; at which George, giving a start and a wild 
hurray, tossed off his glass, clapped it on the 
table, and walked away speedily on his friend’s 
arm. ‘‘The enemy has passed the Sambre,’’ 
William said, ‘‘and our left is already engaged.

  excitement at the news so long looked for, so 
sudden when it came. What were love and 
intrigue now? He thought about a thousand 
things but these in his rapid walk to his quarters: 
his past life and future chances—the fate which 
might be before him—the wife, the child perhaps, 
from whom unseen he might be about to part. 
Oh, how he wished that night’s work undone! and 
that with a clear conscience at least he might 
say farewell to the tender and guileless being 
by whose love he had set such little store. 
‘He thought over his brief married life. In 
those few weeks he had frightfully dissipated 
his little capital. Eow wild and reckless he had 
been! Should any mischance befall him, what 
was then left for her? How unworthy he was 
of hert Why had he married her? He was not 
fit for marriage! Why had he disobeyed his 
father, who had been always so generous to him? 
Hope, remorse, ambition, tenderness, and selfish 
regret filled his heart. He sate down and wrote 
to his father, remembering what he had said 
onee before, when he was engaged to fight a duel. 
‘Dawn faintly streaked the sky as he closed this 
farewell letter. He sealed it, and kissed the 
superseription. He thought how he had deserted 
that generous father, and of the thousand kind- 
nesses which the stern old man had done him. 
He had looked inte Amelia’s bedroom when he 
entered; she lay quiet, and her eyes seemed 
closed, and he was glad that she was asleep. On 
arriving at his quarters.from the ball, he had 
found his regimental servant already making 
preparations for his departure: the man had 
understood his signal to be still, and these

  arrangements were very quickly and silently 
made. Should he go in and wake Amelia, he 
thought, or leave a note for her brother to break 
the news of departure to her? He went in to 
look at her once again. : 
She had been awake when he first entered her 
room, but had kept her eyes closed, so that even 
her wakefulness should not seem to reproach him. 
But when he had returned,—so soon after her- 
self, too,—this timid little heart had felt more at. 
ease; and turning towards him as he stept softly 
out of the room, she had fallen into a light sleep. 
George came in and looked at, her again, ien- 
tering still more softly. By the pale night-lamp 
he could see her sweet, pale face: the purple eye- 
lids were fringed and closed, and one round arm, 
smooth and white, lay outside the coverlet. Good 
God! how pure she was; how gentle, how tender, 
and how friendless! and he, how selfish, brutal, ‘ 
and black with crime! Heart-stained and shame- . 
stricken, he stood at the bed’s foot and looked at 
the sleeping girl. How dared: he—who was he, 
to pray for one so spotless! God bless her! God 
bless her! He came to the bedside, and looked 
at the hand, the little soft hand, lying asleep; 
and he bent over the pillow noiselessly toward 
the gentle pale face. 
Two fair arms closed tenderly around his 
neck as he stooped down. ‘I am awake, 
George,’? the poor child said, with 4 sob fit to: 
break the little heart that nestled so closely by 
his own. She was awake, poor soul—and to 
what? At that moment a bugle from the Place of 
Arms began sounding clearly, and was taken up 
through the town; and ’midst the drums of the

  infantry, and the shrill pipes of the Seotch, the 
whole city awoke. . 
All our friends took their share and fought 
like men in the great field. All day long, whilst 
the women were praying ten miles away, the lines 
of the dauntless English infantry were receiving 
and repelling the furious charges of the French 
horsemen. Guns which were heard at Brussels 
were plowing up their ranks, and comrades fall- 
ing, and the resolute survivors elosing, in. 
Toward evening the attack of the French, re- 
peated and resisted so bravely, slackened in its 
fury. They had other foes besides the British 
to engage, or were preparing for a final onset. 
It ecame.at last: the columns of the Imperial 
Guard marched up the hill of Saint Jean, at 
length and at once to sweep the English from 
the height which they had maintained all day; 
and spite of all, unseared by the thunder of the 
artillery, which hurled death from the English 
line, the dark column prest on and up the hill. 
It seemed almost to crest the eminence, when it 
began to waver and falter. Then it stopt, still 
facing the shot. Then at last the English troops 
rushed from the post from which no enemy had 
been ‘able to dislodge them, and the Guard turned 
and fled. 
No. more firing was heard at Brussels—the 
pursuit rolled miles away. Darkness came down 
on the field and city: and Amelia was praying 
for George, who was lying on his face, dead,. with 
a bullet throvgh | his heart.

where we sat when we were too many for him. 
Besides his customary attendants, he had two

  . his old eyes lighted up with simple happiness, and 
with eager trembling hands he would seek under 
his bedelothes, or the pockets of his dressing- 
gown for toys or cakes, which he had caused to 
be purchased for his grandson. There was a 
little laughing, red-cheeked, white-headed gown- 
boy. of the school, to whom the old man had 
taken a great fancy. One of the symptoms of 
his. returning consciousness and recovery, as we 
hoped, was his calling for this child, who pleased 
“our friend by his archness and merry ways; and 
who, to the old gentleman’s unfailing delight, 
used to call him ‘Codd Colonel.’ ‘Tell little 
F-—— that Codd Colonel wants to see him’’; 
and the little gown-boy was brought to him: and 
the colonel would listen to him for hours,. and 
hear all about his lessons and his play; and 
prattle, almost as childishly,’ about Dr. Raine 
and ‘his own early school-days. The boys of the 
school, it must be said, had heard the noble old 
-gentleman’s touching history, and had all got 
to know and love him. They came every day 
to hear news of him; sent him in books and 
papers to amuse him; and some benevolent young 
souls—God’s blessing on all honest boys, say I— 
painted theatrical characters and sent them in 
to Codd Colonel’s grandson. The little fellow 
was made free of gown-boys, and once came 
thence to his grandfather in a little gown, which 
delighted the old man hugely. Boy said he would 
like to be a little gown-boy; and I make no doubt, 
when he is old enough, his father will get him 
that post, and put him under the tuition of my 
‘friend Dr. Senior. 
So weeks passed away, during which our dear

  old friend still remained with us. His. mind was 
gone at intervals, but would rally feebly; and 
with his conseiousness returned his love, his sim- 
plicity, his sweetness. He would talk Freneh- 
with Madame de Florac; at which time his mem- 
ory appeared to awaken with surprizing vivid-. . 
ness, his chéek flushed, and he was a youth again» 
—a youth all love and hope—a stricken old man, 
with a beard as white as snow covering the noble 
eareworn face. At such times he called her by 
her Christian name of Léonore; he addrest court- 
ly old words of regard and kindness to the aged 
lady; anon he wandered in his talk, and spoke 
to her as if they were still young. Now, as in 
those early days, his heart was pure; no anger 
remained in it; no guile tainted it: only peace 
and good-will dwelt in it. 
Rosey’s death had seemed to shock him for 
a while when the unconscious little boy spoke of © 
it. Before that circumstance, Clive had even 
forborne to wear mourning, lest the news should 
agitate his father. The colonel remained silent 
and was very much disturbed all that day, but 
he never appeared 'to comprehend the fact quite; 
and once or twice afterward asked why she did 
not come to see him? She was prevented, he 
supposed—she was prevented, he said, with a 
look of terror; he never once otherwise alluded 
to that unlucky tyrant of his household who had 
made his last years so unhappy. © 
The circumstance of Clive’s legacy he never 
understood; but more than once spoke of Barnes 
to Ethel, and sent his compliments to him, and 
said he. should like to shake him by, the hand. 
Barnes Newcome never once offered to touch that

  honored hand, tho his. sister bore her uncle’s 
message to him. They came often from Bryan- 
stone Square; Mrs. Hobson even offered to sit 
with the colonel, and read to him, and brought 
him books for his improvement. But her presence 
disturbed him; he cared not for her books: the 
two nurses whom he loved faithfully watched 
him; and my wife and I were admitted to him 
sometimes, both of whom he honored with regard 
and recognition. As for F. B., in order to be 
near his colonel, | did not that good fellow take 
up his lodgings in Cistercian Lane, at the Red 
Cow? He is one whose errors, let us hope, shall 
be pardoned, quia multum amavit. I am sure he 
felt ten times more joy at hearing of Clive’s 
legacy than if thousands had been bequeathed 
to himself. May good health and good fortune 
speed him! 
The days went on; and our hopes, raised some- 
times, began to flicker and fall. One evening the 
eolorel left his chair for his bed in pretty good 
spirits; but passed a disturbed night, and the 
next morning was too weak to rise. Then he 
remained in his bed, and his friends visited him 
there. One afternoon he asked for his little 
- gown-boy, and the child was brought to him, and 
sat by the bed with a very awe-stricken face; 
and then gathered courage, and tried to amuse 
him by telling him how it was a half-holiday, and 
they were having a cricket match with the St. 
Peter’s boys in the green, and Grey Friars was 
in and winning. The colonel quite understood 
about it: he would like to see the game; he had 
played many a game on that green when he was 
a boy. He grew. excited: Clive dismissed his

  father’s little friend, and put a sovereign into 
his hand; and away he ran to say that Codd 
Colonel had come into a fortune, and to buy 
tarts, and to see the match out. JZ, curre, little 
white-haired gown-boy! Heaven speed you, little 
friend. 
After the child had gone, Thomas Newcome 
began to wander more and more. He talked 
louder; he gave the word of command, spoke 
Hindustanee as if to his men. Then he spoke 
words in French rapidly, seizing a hand that was 
near him, and erying, ‘‘Toujours, toujours!’’ But 
it was Ethel’s hand which he took. Ethel and 
Clive and the nurse were in the room. with him; 
the nurse came to us, who were sitting in the 
adjoining apartment; Madame de Florac was 
there with my wife and Bayham. 
At the look in the woman’s countenance 
Madame de Florac started up. ‘‘He.is very 
bad; he wanders a great deal,’’ the nurse whis- 
pered. The French lady fell instantly on her 
knees, and remained rigid in prayer. 
Some time afterward Ethel came in with a 
seared face to our pale group. ‘‘He is calling 
for you again, dear lady,’’ she said, going up to 
Madame de Florae, who was still kneeling; ‘‘and 
just now he said he wanted Pendennis to take 
care of his boy. He will not know you.’’ She 
hid her tears as she spoke. : . 
She went into the room where Clive was at 
the bed’s foot: the old man within it talked on 
rapidly for a while; then again he would sigh 
and.be still; once more I heard him say hurriedly, 
‘‘Take care of him when I’m in India’’; and 
then with a heartrending voice he called out,

  “T,éonore, Léonore!’’ She was kneeling by his 
side now. The patient voice sank into faint mur- 
murs; only a moan. now and then announeed 
that he was not asleep. 
At, the usual evening hour the ehapel bell began 
to. toll, and Thomas Newcome’s hands outside the 
bed feebly beat time. And just as the last bell 
struck, a peculiar sweet smile shone over his - 
face,,.and he lifted up his head a little, and 
quickly ‘said, ‘‘Adsum!’’ and fell back. It was 
the word we used at school when names were 
called; and lo, he, whose heart was as that of 
_ little child, had answered to his name, and 
stood in the presence of The Master.

Hogarth’s lively perspective of Cheapside or read 
of it in a hundred contemporary books which 
paint the manners of that age. Our dear old 
Spectator looks smiling upon the streets, with

passes his time. He rises late, puts on a frock 
and, leaving his sword at home, takes his cane, 
and goes where he pleases. The park is com- 
monly the place where he walks, because ’tis 
the Exchange for men of quality. . "Tis the same 
thing as the Tuileries at Paris, only the park 
has a certain beauty and simplicity which can 
not be described. The grand walk is called the 
Mall; is full of people at every hour of the day, 
but especially at morning and evening, when their 
Majesties often walk with the royal family, who 
are attended only by a half-dozen yeomen of. 
the guard, and permit all persons to walk at the - 
same time with them. The ladies and gentlemen 
always appear in rich dresses, for the English,

but in their army, are now embroidered and be- 
daubed as much as the French. a

is well clothed here, and even the beggars don’t 
make so ragged an appearance as they do else- 
where.’’ After our friend, the man of quality, 
has had his morning or undress walk in the Mall, 
he goes home to dress, and then saunters to some 
coffee-house or chocolate-house frequented by the 
persons he would see. ‘‘For ’tis a rule with the 
English to'go once a day at least to. houses of 
this sort, where they talk of business and news, 
read. the papers, and often look at one another 
without opening their lips. And ’tis very well 
they are'so mute; for were they all as talkative 
as people of other nations, the eoffee-houses 
would be intolerable, and there would be no 
hearing what one man said where there are so 
many. The chocolate-house in St. James’s Street, 
where I go every morning to pass away time, is 
always so full that a man can scarce turn about 
in it.” 
Delightful as London city was, King George 1

and when there, passed all his time with his 
Germans. It was with them as with Blucher,

BOB SAWYER’S PARTY* 
Wuewn the last ‘‘natural’’ had been declared, 
and the profit and loss account of fish and six- 
eRe adjusted, to the satisfaction of all parties, 
Bob Sawyer rang for supper, .and the visitors 
squeezed themselves into corners while it was 
getting ready. 
It was not so easily got ready as some people 
may.imagine. First of all, it was necessary to 
awaken the girl, who had fallen asleep with her 
face on the kitchen table; this took a little time, 
and, even when she did answer the bell, another 
quarter of an hour was consumed in fruitless 
endeavors to impart to her a faint and distant 
glimmering of reason. The man to whom the 
order for the oysters had been sent, had not 
been told to open them; it is a very difficult 
thing to open an oyster with a limp knife or a 
two-pronged fork, and very little was done in 
this way. Very little of the beef was done either; 
and the ham (which was also from the German 
sausage-shop round the corner) was in a similar 
* predicament. However, there was plenty of por- 
ter in a tin can; and the cheese went a great

way, for it was very strong. So upon the whole, 
perhaps, the supper was quite as good as such 
matters usually are. . . 
After supper another jug of punch was put 
upon the table, together with a paper of cigars,. 
and a couple of bottles of spirits. Then there | 
was an awful pause; and this awful pause was 
occasioned by a very common oceurrence in this, 
sort of places, but. a very embarrassing one not- 
withstanding. ‘ 
The fact is that the girl was washing the 
glasses. The establishment boasted four; we do 
not record the circumstance. as at all derogatory 
to Mrs. Raddle, for there never was a lodging- 
house yet that was not short of glasses. 
The landlady’s glasses were little thin blown- 
glass tumblers, and those which had been -bor- 
rowed from the public house were great, drop- 
sical, bloated articles, each supported on a huge 
gouty leg. This would have been in itself sufii- 
cient to have possest the company with the real 
state of affairs; but the young woman of all. 
work had prevented the possibility of any mis- 
conception arising in the mind of any gentlemen 
on the subject, by forcibly dragging every man’s 
glass away, long before he had finished his beer, 
and audibly stating, despite the winks and inter- 
ruptions of Mr. Bob Sawyer, that it was to be 
conveyed down-stairs, and washed forthwith. 
It is a very ill wind that blows nobody. any 
good. The prim man in the cloth boots, who 
had been unsuccessfully attempting to make a 
joke during the whole time the round game lasted, 
saw his opportunity, and availed himself of it. 
The instant the glasses disappeared he commenced

‘Rame he had forgotten, making a particular 
happy reply to another ‘eminent and illustrious 
individual whom he had never been able to iden- 
tify. He enlarged at some length and with great 
moinuteness. upon divers collateral circumstances, 
distantly. connected with. the. anecdote in hand, 
but. for ‘the life of him he couldn’t recollect at 
that precise moment what the anecdote was, altho 
he‘had been in the habit of telling the story with 
great applause for the last ten years. 
‘‘Dear me,’’ said the prim man in the cloth 
boots, ‘‘it is a very extraordinary circumstance.’’ 
“Tam sorry you have forgotten it,?’ said Mr. 
Bob Sawyer, glancing eagerly at the door, as he 
thought he heard the noise of glasses jingling— ‘¢yery sorry.’” . 
“‘So.am I,’’ responded the-prim man, ‘‘beeause 
I know it would have afforded so much amuse- 
_ ment. “Never mind; I dare say I shall manage 
to recollect it, in the ‘course of half an hour

whole time, said he should very much like to hear 
the. end.of-it, for, so far as it went, it was, 
Rithout exception, the very best story he had ever 
eard. © 
The sight of the tumblers restored Bob Sawyer 
to a degree of equanimity which he had not pos- 
sest since his interview with his landlady. His 
face brightened up and he began to feel quite 
convivial.

‘*No,’? said the girl, with a shake of the head 
which exprest a more decided negative than the 
most copious language could have conveyed. 
‘<Missis Raddle said you warn’t to have none.’” 
The surprize depicted on the countenances of 
his guests imparted new courage to the host. 
“Bring up the warm water instantly —in-_

sternness. 
“‘No; I ean’t,’’ replied the girl; ‘‘Missis Rad- 
dle raked out the kitchen fire afore she went

“Oh, never mind; never mind. Pray, don’t . 
disturb yourself about such a trifle,’’ said Mr. 
Pickwick, observing the conflict of Bob Sawyer’s 
passions, as depicted in his countenance, ‘‘cold 
water will do very well.”’ 
“‘Qh, admirably,’’ said Mr. Benjamin Allen.

_ Mr. Bob Sawyer’s heart-sickening ‘attempts to 
tally under this last blow communicated a dispir- 
‘iting influence to the company, the greater part 
of whom, with the view of raising their spirits, 
attached themselves with extra cordiality to the 
eold brandy and water, the first perceptible effects 
of which were displayed in a renewal of hos- 
tilities between the scorbutie youth and the gen- 
fleman in the sanguine shirt. The belligerents 
vented. their feelings of mutual contempt, for 
some time, in a variety of frownings and snort- 
ings, until at last the scorbutie youth felt it 
- necessary to come to a more explicit understand- 
ing on the matter; when the following clear 
understanding took place. 
“‘Sawyer,’’ said. the scorbutie youth. 
‘«Well, Noddy,’’ replied Mr, Bob Sawyer. ’ 
“<T should be very sorry, Sawyer,’’ said Mr. 
Noddy, ‘‘to create any unpleasantness at any 
friend’s table, and much less at yours, Sawyer— 
very; but I must take this opportunity of in- 
forming Mr. Gunter that he is no gentleman.’’ 
‘And I should be very sorry, Sawyer, to ereate 
‘any disturbanee in the street in which you re- 
side,’’-said Mr. Gunter, ‘‘but I’m afraid I shall 
be under the necessity of alarming the neighbors 
by throwing the person who has just spoken, out 
‘o” window.’ 
“What do you mean by that, Sir?’’ inquired 
Mr. ‘Noddy. 
“What I say, Sir,’’ replied Mr. Gunter. 
“T should like to see you do it, Sir,’’ said 
Mr. Noddy. 
« “You shall feel me do it in half a minute, 
_ Sir,” replied Mr. Gunter.

“T request that youll favor me with- your 
ecard, Sir,’’ said Mr. Noddy. -.. 
“Yl do nothing of the kind, Sir,’’ replied 
Mr. Gunter. 
‘Why not, Sir?’’ inquired Mr. Noddy. : 
‘Because you'll stick it up over your chimney- 
piece, and delude your visitors into the false 
belief that a gentleman had been to see you, 
Sir,’’ replied Mr. Gunter. 
“Sir, a friend of mine shall wait on you in 
the morning,’’ said Mr. Noddy. 
“Sir, I’m very much obliged to you for the 
eaution, and I’ll leave particular directions with 
the servants to lock up the spoons,’’ replied Mr. 
Gunter. : 
At this point the remainder of the guests inter- 
posed, and remonstrated with both parties on 
the impropriety of their conduct, on which Mr. 
Noddy begged to state that his father was quite as 
respectable as Mr. Gunter’s father; to which 
Mr. Gunter replied that his father was to tha 
full as respectable as Mr. Noddy’s father, and 
that his father’s son was as good a man as Mr. 
Noddy, any day in the week. As this announce- 
ment seemed the prelude to a recommencement 
of the dispute, there was another interference 
on the part of the company; and a vast quantity 
of talking and clamoring ensued, in the course 
of which Mr. Noddy gradually allowed his feel- 
ings to overpower him, and profest that he had — 
ever entertained a devoted personal attachment 
toward Mr. Gunter. To this Mr. Gunter replied 
that, upon the whole, he rather preferred, Mr. 
Noddy to his own brother; on hearing which ad- 
mission, Mr. Noddy magnanimously rose from his

gent, and proferred his -hand to, Me. Gunter. 
‘Mr. Gunter grasped it with affecting’ fervor; and 
_ - everybody said that the whole dispute had been 
.. conducted in & manner which was highly hon- 
orable to both parties concerned. 
“Now,’? said Jack Hopkins, ‘‘just to set us 
going again, Bob, I don’t mind singing a song.’ 
And Hopkins, incited thereto by tumultuous ap- 
plause, plunged himself at once into ‘‘The King, 
God Bless Him,’’ which he sang as loud as he 
could, toa novel air, compounded to the ‘‘Bay 
of Biseay,’? and ‘‘A Frog He Would.’’ The 
‘chorus was the essence of the song, and, as each 
-gentleman sang it to the tune he knew best, the 
effect was very striking indeed. 
It was at the end of the chorus to.the first 
verse, that Mr. Pickwick held up his hand in a 
listening. attitude, and said, as soon as silence 
was restored: 
‘*Hush! I beg your pardon. I thought T heard 
somebody ealling from up-stairs.’’ 
“A profound silence immediately ensued; and

around him with great dismay. ‘‘Yes, Mrs.

“‘T thought you were making too much noise.’’

man. ‘‘Just as we were getting so comfortable

beginning to have a dawning recollection of the 
story he had forgotten. co

“Shall I step up-stairs, and pitch into the 
landlord?’’ inquired Hopkins, ‘‘or keep on 
ringing the bell, or go and groan on the staircase? 
‘You: may command me, Bob.’’ 
“T-am very much indebted to you for your 
friendship and good nature, Hopkins,’’ said the 
wretched Mr. Bob Sawyer, ‘but I think the best 
plan to avoid any further dispute is for us to 
break up at once.’’ 
*‘Now, Mr. Sawyer,’’ sereamed the shrill voice 
of Mrs. Raddle, ‘‘are them brutes going?’’ 
‘“'They’re only looking for their hats, Mrs. 
Raddle,’’ said Bob; ‘‘they are going directly.”

nighteap over the banisters just as Mr. Pickwick, 
followed by Mr. Tupman, emerged from the 
sitting-room. ‘‘Going! What did they ever come 
for?’”

“Get along with you, you old wretch!’’ replied 
Mrs. Raddle, hastily withdrawing the nightcap. 
‘Qld. enough to be his grandfather, you villain!

Mr. Pickwick found it ‘ih vain to protest his 
innoeenee, so hurried down-stairs into the street, 
whither he was closely followed by Mr. Tupman, 
Mr. Winkle, and Mr. Snodgrass. Mr. Ben Allen,

perform this painful duty of a brother with proper 
firmness, he burst into tears, knocked his hat over’

knocked double knocks at the door of the Borough 
Market, and took short naps on the steps alter-

direction of the door, which it occurred to him,

servant, who always had a cold from damp living. 
Looking intently that way one night, he plainly 
distinguished an eye gleaming and glistening at 
the keyhole; and having now no doubt that his 
suspicions were correct, he stole softly to the 
door, and pounced upon her before she was aware 
of his approach. 
“Oh! I didn’t mean any harm indeed. Upon 
my word. I didn’t,’’ cried the small servant, 
‘struggling like a much larger one. ‘‘It’s so very 
dull, down-stairs. Please don’t you tell upon

in their nature, and showed her concern so plainly 
in her looks that Mr. Swiveller felt it necessary 
to discharge his brigand manner for one more 
suitable to private life, as he asked: 
“Do they often go where glory waits ’em, and 
leave you here?’’ 
“‘Oh, yes; I believe you they do,’’ returned the 
small servant. ‘‘Miss Sally’s such a one-er for 
that, she is.’’ 
‘*Such a what?’’ said Dick. 
‘*Such a -one-er,’’ returned the Marchioness. 
After a moment’s reflection, Mr. Swiveller de- 
termined to forego his responsible duty of setting 
her right, and to suffer her to talk on; as it was 
evident that her tongue was loosened by the purl, 
and her opportunities for conversation were not 
so frequent as to render a momentary check of 
little consequence. 
“‘They sometimes go to see Mr. Quilp,’’ said 
the small servant with a shrewd look, ‘‘they go 
toa many places, bless you.’’ 
‘*Ts Mr. Brass a wunner?’’ said Dick. 
““*Not half what Miss Sally is, he isn’t,’’ re- 
plied the small servant, shaking her head. ‘‘Bless 
you, he’d never do anything without her.’’ 
“Oh! He wouldn’t, wouldn’t he?’’ said Dick. 
“Miss Sally keeps him in such order,’’ said 
the small servant; ‘‘he always asks her advice, 
he does; and he catches it sometimes. Bless you, 
you wouldn’t. believe how much he eatehes it.’’ 
“I suppose,’’ said Dick, ‘‘that they consult 
together a good deal, and about a great many 
people—about me, for instance, sometimes, eh???

The Marchioness nodded amazingly. 
‘Complimentary ?’’ said Mr. Swiveller. 
The Marchioness changed the motion of her 
head, which had not yet left off nodding, and 
suddenly began to shake it from side to side with 
vehemence which threatened to dislocate her neck. | 
‘sHumph!’’ Dick muttered. ‘‘Would it be any. 
breach of confidence, Marchioness, to relate what 
they say of the humble individual who has now - 
the honor to—?’’ 
‘Miss Sally says you’re a funny chap,’’ re- 
plied his friend. 
‘*Well, Marchioness,’’? said Mr. Swiveller, 
“that’s not uncomplimentary. Merriment, Mar- 
chioness, is not a bad or degrading quality. Old 
King Cole was him a merry old soul, if we may 
put any faith in the pages of history.’’ 
“<But she says,’’ pursued his companion, ‘‘that 
you an’t to be trusted.’’ ke 
“Why, really, Marchioness,’’ said Mr. Swiv-’ 
eller, thoughtfully, ‘‘several ladies and gentlemen 
—not exactly professional persons, but trades- 
people, ma’am, tradespeople—have made the 
same remark. The obscure citizen who keeps 
the hotel over the way, inelined strongly to that 
opinion to-night when I ordered him to prepare 
the banquet. It’s a popular prejudice, Mar-. 
ehioness; and yet I am sure I don’t know why, 
for I have been trusted in my time to a con- — 
siderable amount, and I can safely say that I 
never forsook my trust until it deserted me— 
never. Mr. Brass is of the same opinion, I sup- 
pose?’” 
His friend nodded again, with a eunning look 
whieh seemed to hint that Mr. Brass held stronger

ing to recollect herself, added imploringly, ‘‘But 
don’t you ever tell upon me, or I shall be beat 
to death.’’ oe 
‘*Marehioness,’’ said Mr. Swiveller, rising, 
_ ‘the word of a gentleman is as good as his bond 
sometimes better; as in the present case, where 
his bond might prove but a doubtful sort of 
security. I am your friend, and I hope we shall play 
many more rubbers together in this same saloon. 
But, Marchioness,’’ added Richard, stopping in 
his way to the door, and wheeling slowly round 
upon the small servant, who was following with 
the candle; ‘‘it occurs to me that you must be 
in the constant habit of airing your eye at key- 
‘holes, to. know all this.’’ 
**T only wanted,’’ replied the trembling Mar- 
chionéss, ‘‘to know where the key of the safo

much if-I had found it—only enough to squench 
my hunger”? . “You didn’t find it then?’’ said Dick. ‘‘But 
of course ‘you didn’t, or you’d be plumper. Good

  IV 
A HAPPY RETURN OF THE DAY‘ 
Mr. and Mrs. Wilfer had seen a full quarter 
of a hundred more anniversaries of their wedding- 
day than Mr. and Mrs. Lammle had seen of 
theirs, but they still celebrated the occasion in 
the bosom of their family. Not that these cele- 
brations ever resulted in anything particularly 
agreeable, or that the family was ever disap- 
pointed by that circumstance on account of hav- 
ing looked forward to the return of the auspicious 
day with sanguine anticipations of enjoyment. It 
was kept morally, rather as a Fast than a Feast, 
enabling Mrs. Wilfer to hold a somber darkling 
state, which exhibited that impressive woman in 
her choicest colors. 
The noble lady’s eondition on these delightful 
oceasions was one compounded of heroie en- 
durance and heroic forgiveness. Lurid indica- 
tions of the better marriages she might have 
made, shone athwart the awful gloom of her com- 
posure, and fitfully revealed the cherub as a little 
monster unaceountably favored by Heaven, who 
had possest himself of a blessing, for which many 
of his superiors had sued and contended in vain. 
So firmly had this his position toward his treasure 
become established, that when the anniversary ~ 
arrived, it always found him in an apologetic 
state. It is not impossible that his modest peni- 
tence may have even gone the length of sometimes - 
‘From Book III, Chapter IV, of “Our Mutual Friend.”

  severely reproving him for that he ever took the 
:liberty of making so exalted a character his wife. 
' As for the children of the union, their experi- 
ence of these festivals had been sufficiently un- 
comfortable to lead them annually to wish, when 
out of their tenderest years, either that Ma had 
married somebody else instead of much-teased 
Pa that Pa had married somebody else instead 
of Ma. : 
When there came to be but two sisters left at 
home, the daring mind of Bella on the nest of 
these occasions scaled the height of wondering 
with. droll vexation, ‘‘what on earth Pa ever could 
“have seen in Ma, to induce him to make such a 
little fool of himself as to ask her to have him.’’ 
The revolving year now bringing the day round 
in its orderly sequence, Bella arrived in the Boffin 
chariot to assist at the celebration. It was the 
family custom when the day recurred to sacrifice 
a pair of fowls on the altar of Hymen ; and Bella 
had sent.a note beforehand, to intimate that she 
- would bring the votive offering with her. So, 
Bella and the fowls, by the united energies of 
‘two horses, two men, four wheels, and a plum- 
pudding carriage dog with as uncomfortable a 
collar on as if he had been George the Fourth, 
were deposited at the door of the parental dwell- 
ing. They were there received by Mrs. Wilfer 
in person, whose dignity on this, as on most spe- 
cial. oceasions, was heightened by a mysterious 
toothache. 
J shall not require the carriage at night,” said Bella. ‘‘I shall walk back.’’ 
The male domestie of Mrs. Boffin touched his 
hat, and in the aet of departure had an awful 
106
-P-A-G-E-120
CHARLES DICKENS Ce 
glare bestowed upon him by Mrs. Wilfer, in- 
tended to earry deep into his audacious soul the 
assurance that, whatever his private suspicions 
might be, male domestics in livery were no rarity 
there. . : 
‘Well, dear Ma,’’ said Bella, ‘‘and how do’ 
you do?”’ : 
“<I am as well, Bella,’’ replied Mrs. Wilfer, 
“as ean be expected.”’ 
‘Dear me, Ma,’’ said Bella, ‘‘you talk as if 
one was just born!’’ 
“<That’s exactly what Ma has been doing,’’ 
interposed Lavvy, over the maternal shoulder, 
‘ever since we got up this morning. It’s all very 
well to laugh, Bella, but anything more exas- 
perating it is impossible to conceive.’’ _ 
Mrs. Wilfer, with a look too full of majesty 
to be accompanied by any words, attended both 
her daughters to the kitchen, where the sacrifice 
was to be prepared. 
“‘Mr, Rokesmith,’’ said she, resignedly, ‘‘has 
been so polite as to place his sitting-room at our 
disposal to-day. ‘You will therefore, Bella, be 
entertained in the humble abode of your parents, 
so far in accordance with your present style of 
living, that there will be a drawing-room for your 
reception as well as a dining-room. Your papa 
invited Mr. Rokesmith to partake of our lowly. 
fare. In excusing himself on account of a par- 
ticular engagement, he offered the use of his 
apartment.’’ 
Bella happened to know that he had no engage- 
ment out of his own room at Mr. Boffin’s, but 
she approved of his staying away. ‘‘We should 
only have put one another out of countenance,”’ 
107 
 
-P-A-G-E-121
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD'S CLASSICS 
  she thought, ‘‘and we do that quite often enough 
as it is.’” 
Yet she had sufficient euriosity about his room 
' to ran up to it with the least possible delay, and 
make a close inspection of its contents. It was 
tastefully tho economically furnished, and very 
neatly arranged. There were shelves and stands 
of books, English, French, and Italian; and. in 
a portfolio on the writing-table there were sheets 
upon sheets of memoranda and calculations in 
figures, evidently referring to the Boffin property. 
On that table also, carefully backed with canvas, 
varnished, mounted, and rolled like a map, was 
the placard descriptive of the murdered man who 
had eome from afar to be her husband. She 
shrank from this ghostly surprize, and felt quite 
frightened as she rolled and tied it up again. 
Peeping about here and there, she came upon a 
print, a graceful head of a pretty woman, elegant- 
ly framed, hanging in the corner by the easy 
chair, “Oh, indeed, Sir!’’ said Bella, after stop- 
ping to ruminate before it. “Oh, indeed, Sir! 
I:faney I ean guess whom you think that’s like. 
But I'l! tell you what it’s much more like—your 
impudence!’? Having said which she decamped: 
not solely because she was offended, but because 
there was nothing else to look at. 
“Now, Ma,’’ said Bella, reappearing in the 
kitchen with some remains of a blush, ‘‘you and 
Lavvy think magnificent me fit for nothing, but 
I intend to prove the contrary. I mean to be 
cook to-day.’ 
eEolal” rejoined “her majestie mother. ‘I 
ean not permit it. Cook in that dress!’ 
*tAs for my dress, Ma,’’ returned Bella, mer- 
108
-P-A-G-E-122
    CHARLES DICKENS 
  rily searching in a dresser-drawer, ‘‘I mean to 
apron it and. towel it all over the front;. and. as 
to permission, I'mean to do without.’’ 
“You cook?’’ said Mrs. Wilfer. ‘‘You who 
never cooked when you were.at home?’’ 
‘Yes, Ma,’’ returned Bella; ‘‘that is preeisely 
the state of the ease.’’ 
She girded herself with a white apron, and 
busily with knots and pins contrived a bib to it, 
coming close and tight under her chin, as if it 
had caught her round the neck to kiss her. Over 
this bib her dimples looked delightful, and under 
it her pretty figure not less so: ‘‘Now, Ma,’’ said 
Bella, pushing back her hair from her temples 
with both hands, ‘‘what’s first?’’ 
‘*First,’’ returned Mrs. Wilfer solemnly, ‘‘if 
you persist in what I can not but regard as conduct. 
utterly incompatible with the equipage in which 
you arrived—’’ 
(‘Which I do, Ma.’’) , 
“First, then, you put the fowls down to the 
fire.’? 
““To—be—sure!’’ eried Bella; ‘‘and flour 
them, and twirl them around, and there they go!”’ 
sending them spinning at a great rate. ‘‘What’s 
next, Ma?”’ 
‘‘Next,’’ said Mrs. Wilfer with a wave of her 
gloves, expressive of abdication under protest 
from the culinary throne, ‘‘I would recommend 
examination of the bacon in the saucepan on the 
fire, and also of the potatoes by the application 
of a fork. Preparation of the greens will further 
pecome necessary 1f you persist in this unseemly 
demeanor.’” 
*‘As of course I do, Ma.’’

+ Persisting, Bella gave her attention to one 
- thing and forgot the other, and gave her atten- 
tion to the other and forgot. the third, and re- 
membering the third was distracted by the fourth, 
and, made amends whenever she went wrong by 
giving the unfortunate fowls an extra spin, which 
made their chance of ever getting cooked exceeding- 
ly doubtful. But it was pleasant cookery too. Mean- 
while Miss Lavinia, oscillating between the kitch- 
en and the opposite room, prepared the dining- 
table in the latter chamber. This office she (al- 
-ways doing her household spiriting with un- 
willingness) performed in a startling series of 
‘whisks and bumps; laying the table-eloth as if 
shé. were raising the wind, putting down the 
glasses and salt-cellars as if she were knocking at 
the door, and clashing the knives and forks in 
a skirmishing manner suggestive of hand-to-hand 
conflict. 
~ “Took at Ma,’? whispered Lavinia to Bella 
when this was done, and they stood over the 
roasting fowls. ‘‘If one was the most dutiful 
child in existence (of course, on the whole, one 
hopes one is), isn’t she enough to make one want 
to-poke her with something wooden, sitting there 
‘bolt: upright in the corner?’ 
“Only suppose,’’ returned Bella, ‘‘that poor 
Pa was to sit bolt upright in another corner.’’ 
“(My dear, he couldn’t do it,’’ said Lavvy. 
‘*Pa' would loll directly. But indeed I do not 
believe there ever was any human creature who 
_ ould keep so bolt upright as Ma, or put such an 
amount of aggravation into one back! What’s 
‘the matter, Ma? Ain’t you well, Ma?’’ 
.. “Doubtless I am very well,’’ returned Mrs,

  Wilfer, turning her eyes upon her youngest born, 
with scornful fortitude. ‘‘What should. be the 
matter with me?’’ 
*‘You don’t seem very brisk, Ma,’’ retorted 
Lavvy the bold. 
‘‘Brisk?’’ repeated her parent. “Brisk? 
Whence the low expression, Lavinia? If I am 
uneomplaining, if I am silently contented with 
my lot, let that suffice for my family.’’ 
‘Well, Ma,’’ returned Lavvy, ‘‘since you will 
force it out of me, I must respectfully take leave 
to say that your family are no doubt under the 
greatest obligations to you for having an annual 
toothache on your wedding-day, and that it’s very 
disinterested in you, and an immense blessing to 
them. Still, on the whole, it-is impossible to be 
too boastful even of that boon:’? 
‘*You incarnation of saueiness,’’ said Mrs. 
Wilfer, ‘‘do you speak like that to *me? On this 
day of all days in the year? Pray do you know 
what would have become of you, if I had not 
bestowed my hand upon R. W., your father, on 
this day?’’ 
‘*No, Ma,’® replied Lavvy, “T really do not; 
and, with the greatest respect for your abilities 
and information, I very much doubt if you do 
either.’ 
Whether or no the sharp vigor of this sally 
on a weak point of Mrs. Wilfer’s entrenchments. 
might have routed that heroine for the time, is 
rendered uncertain by the arrival of a flag of 
. truce in the person of Mr. George Sampson: 
bidden to the feast as a friend of the family, 
whose affections were now understood td be in 
course of transference from Bella to Lavinia, and 
V1

  whom Lavinia kept—possibly in remembrance of 
his’ bad taste in having overlooked her in the 
first instance—under a course of stinging dis- 
cipline.” - a 
“*T congratulate you, Mrs. Wilfer,’’ said Mr. 
George Sampson, who had meditated this neat 
address while coming along, ‘‘on the day.’’ Mrs. 
Wilfer thanked him with a magnanimous sigh, 
and again became an unresisting prey to that 
inscrutable toothache. 
**1 am surprized,’’ said Mr. Sampson feebly, 
‘<that Miss Bella condescends to eook.’’ 
‘Here Miss Lavinia descended on the ill-starred 
young gentleman with a crushing supposition 
that at all events it was no business of his. This 
disposed of Mr. Sampson in a melancholy retire- 
ment of spirit, until the cherub arrived, whose 
amazement at the lovely woman’s occupation was 
great. noe 
However, she persisted in dishing the dinner as 
well as cooking it, and then sat down, bibless and 
apronless, to partake of it as an illustrious guest: 
‘Mrs. Wilfer first responding to her husband’s 
cheerful ‘‘For what we are about to receive—’”’ 
with: a, sepulchral Amen, ealculated to cast a 
damp: upon the stoutest appetite. 
“But what,’’ said Bella, as she watched the 
carving of the fowls, ‘‘makes them pink inside, 
I wonder, Pa! Is it the breed?’ 
**No; I don’t think it’s the breed, my dear,’’ 
returned Pa. ‘‘I rather think it is because they 
are not done.’’ : 
‘They ought to be,’’ said Bella. : 
‘Yes, I’m aware they ought to be, my dear,’’ 
rejoined her father, ‘‘but they—ain’t.’’

  So, the gridiron was put in requisition, and the 
good-tempered cherub, who was often ‘as un- 
cherubically employed in his own family as if 
he had been in the employment of some of the 
Old Masters, undertook to grill the fowls, In- 
deed, except in respect of staring about him (a 
branch of the public service to which the pic-- 
torial cherub is much addicted), this domestic 
cherub discharged as many odd functions as his 
prototype; with the difference, say, that he 
performed with a blacking-brush on the family’s 
boots, instead of performing on enormous wind: 
instruments and double-basses, and that he con- 
ducted himself with cheerful alacrity to much 
useful purpose, instead of foreshortening himself 
in the air with the vaguest intentions. 
Bella helped him with his supplemental cookery, 
and made him very happy, but put him in mortal 
terror too by asking him when they sat down at 
table again, how he supposed they cooked fowls 
at the Greenwich dinner, and whether he believed 
they really were such pleasant dinners as people 
said? His secret winks and nods of remon- 
strance, in reply, made the mischievous Bella 
Jaugh until she choked, and then Lavinia was 
obliged to slap her on the back, and then she 
laughed the more. 
But her mother was a fine corrective at the 
other end of the table; to whom her father, in the ~ 
innocence of his good fellowship, at intervals . 
appealed with: ‘‘My dear, I am afraid you are 
not enjoying yourself?”’ 
‘Why so, R. W.?’’ she would sonorously reply. 
‘ ‘Because, my dear, you seem a little out of 
sorts.

  “Not at all,’’? would be the rejoinder, in 
exactly the same tone. 
“Would you take a merry-thought, my dear??? 
“eThank you. I will take whatever you please, R Ww. ” 
“Well, but my dear, do you like it?’’ 
“rl like it as well. as I like anything, R. W.’’ 
The ‘stately woman would then, with a meri- 
torious appearance of devoting herself to the 
general good, pursue her dinner as if she were 
feeding somebody else on high publie grounds. 
Bella had brought dessert and two bottles of 
“wine, thus shedding unprecedented splendor on 
the occasion. Mrs. Wilfer did the honors of 
the first glass by proclaiming: ‘‘R. W., I drink 
to you.’’ 
“Thank you, my dear. And I to you.’’ 
**Pa and Ma!’’ said Bella. 
‘*Permit me,’’? Mrs: Wilfer interposed, with 
outstretched glove. ‘‘No. I think not. I drank 
to your Pa. If, however, you insist on including 
me, I can in gratitude offer no objection.’ 
_. “Why, Lor, Ma,’’ interposed Lavvy the bold, 
‘isn’t it the.day that made you and Pa one and 
the same? I have no patience.’’ 
‘By whatever other circumstances the day 
may be marked, it is not the day, Lavinia, on 
which I will allow a child of mine to pounce upon 
me. I beg—nay, command!—that you will not 
pounce. R. W., it is appropriate to recall that 
it is for you to command and for me to obey.’’ 
‘It-is your house, and you are master at your 
own table. Both our: healths!’’ Drinking the 
"toast with tremendous stiffness. 
“‘T really am a little afraid, my dear,’’ hinted 
114
-P-A-G-E-128
  CHARLES DICKENS 
  the cherub meekly, ‘‘that you are not enjoying 
yourself ?’” : , 
“On the contrary,’’ returned Mrs. Wilfer, 
“quite so. Why should I not?’’ : 
“<T thought, my dear, that perhaps your fae 
might—’”’ : 
“My face might be a martyrdom, but what 
would that import, or who should know it if I: 
smiled??? 
And she did smile; manifestly freezing the © 
blood of Mr. George Sampson’ by so doing. For 
that young gentleman, catching her smiling eye, 
‘was so very much appalled by its expression as to 
cast in his thoughts concerning what he had done 
to bring it down upon himself. . 
“<The mind naturally falls,’’ said Mrs. Wilfer, 
‘shall I say into a reverie, or shall I say into a. 
retrospect? on a day like this.’’ 
Lavvy, sitting with defiantly folded arms, re- 
plied (but not audibly), ‘‘For goodness’ sake 
say whichever of the two you like best, Ma, and 
get it over.’’ 
“The mind,’’ pursued Mrs. Wilfer in an 
oratorical manner, ‘‘naturally reverts to Papa 
and Mama—I here allude to my parents—at 
a period before the earliest dawn of this day. | 
I was considered tall; perhaps I was. Papa 
and Mama were unquestionably tall. I have 
rarely seen a Sner woman than my mother; 
never than my father.’’ 
The irrepressible Lavvy remarked aloud, 
‘Whatever grandpapa was, he wasn’t a female,’’ 
“Your grandpapa,’’ retorted Mrs. Wilfer, with 
an awful look, and in an awful tone, ‘‘was what 
I describe him to have been, and would have 
115
-P-A-G-E-129
  THE. BEST OF THE WORLD'S CLASSICS 
  struck any of his grandchildren to the earth 
.Who presumed to question it. It. was one of 
Mama’s cherished hopes that I should become 
united to a tall member of society. It may have 
been a. weakness, but if, so, it was equally the 
weakness, I believe, of King Frederick of 
Prussia.’? These remarks being offered to Mr. 
, George Sampson, who had not the courage to 
come out for single combat, but lurked with his 
chest under the table and his eyes cast down, 
Mrs. Wilfer proceeded, in a voice of increasing 
sternness and impressiveness, until she should 
force that skulker to give himself up. ‘‘Mama 
would appear to have had an indefinable fore- 
boding of what afterward happened, for she 
would frequently urge upon me, ‘Not a little 
man. Promise me, my child, not a little man. 
Never, never, never marry .a- ittle man!” Papa 
also would remark to me (he possest extraor- 
dinary humor), ‘That a family of whales must 
not..ally themselves with sprats.’ 
‘*His company was eagerly sought, as may be 
supposed, by the wits of the day, and our house 
was their continual resort. I have known as 
many as three copper-plate engravers exchan- 
ging the most exquisite sallies and retorts there, 
at one time.’’ (Here Mr. Sampson delivered 
himself captive, and said, -with an uneasy move- 
ment-on his chair, that three was a large number, 
and it. must have been. highly entertaining). 
“‘Among the most prominent members of that 
distinguished circle, was a gentleman measuring 
six feet four in height. He was not an en- 
grayer.’’? (Here Mr. Sampson said, with no 
reason whatever, of course not.) “This gentle- 
116
-P-A-G-E-130
  CHARLES DICKENS © 
  man was so obliging as to honor me with. atten- 
tions which I could not fail to understand.’’ 
(Here Mr. Sampson murmured that when it came 
to that, you could always tell.) ‘‘I immediately 
announced to both parents that those attentions 
were misplaced, and that I could not favor his 
suit. They inquired was he too tall? I replied 
it was not the stature, but the intellect was too. 
lofty. At our house, I said, the tone was too 
brilliant, the pressure was too high, to be main- 
tained by me, a mere woman, in every-day 
domestic life. I well remember Mama’s clasp- 
ing her hands, and exclaiming, ‘This will end 
in a little man!’’’ (Here Mr. Sampson glanced 
at his host and shook his head with despondency.) 
“‘She afterward went so far as to predict that 
it would end in a little man whose mind would 
be below the average, but that was in what I 
may denominate a paroxysm of maternal disap- . 
pointment, Within a month,’’ said Mrs. Wilfer, . 
deepening her voice, as if she were relating a 
terrible ghost story, ‘‘within a month, I first 
saw R. W., my husband. Within a year I married 
him. It is natural for the mind to recall these 
dark coincidences on the present day.’’ 
Mr. Sampson, at length released from the 
custody of Mrs. Wilfer’s eye, now drew @ long 
breath, and made the original and striking 
remark, that there was no accounting for these 
sort of presentiments. R. W. scratched his head 
and looked apologetically all round the table 
until he came to his wife, when observing her as 
it were shrouded in a more somber veil than 
before, he once more hinted, ‘‘“My dear, T am 
yeally afraid you are not altogether enjoying 
117
-P-A-G-E-131

_yourself?’’? To which she- once more replied, 
“On the contrary, R. W. Quite so.’’ * 
». ‘The wretched Mr. Sampson’s position at this 
agreeable entertainment’ was truly pitiable. For, 
mot only was he exposed defenseless to the 
harangues of Mrs. Wilfer, but he received the 
utmost contumely at the hands of Lavinia, who, 
partly to show Bella that she (Lavinia) could 
_ do: what-she liked with him, and partly to pay 
him off for still obviously admiring Bella’s 
beauty, led him the life of a dog. IIluminated 
on the one hand by the stately graces of Mrs. 
Wilfer’s oratory, and shadowed on the other by 
the checks and frowns of the young lady to 
whom he had devoted himself in his destitution,

OF THE AUTHOR OF “VANITY FAIR”* 
To that class in whose eyes whatever is un- 
usual is wrong; whose ears detect in each protest 
against bigotry—that parent of crime—an insult 
to piety, that regent of God on earth, I would 
suggest to such doubters certain obvious distine- 
tions; I would remind them of certain simple 
truths. . 
Conventionality is not morality. Self- 
righteousness is not religion. To attack the first 
is not to assail the last. To pluck the mask from 
the face of the Pharisee is not to lift an impious 
hand to the crown of thorns. These things 
and deeds are diametrically opposed; they are 
as distinct as vice from virtue. Men too often 
confound them: they should not be confounded: 
appearance should not be mistaken for truth; 
narrow human doctrines, that only tend to elate

The world may not like to see these ideas

Ahab did not like Micaiah, because he never 
prophesied good concerning him, but evil: 
probably he liked the sycophant son of Chenaanah 
better; yet might Ahab have escaped a bloody 
death, had he but stopt his ears to flattery, and 
opened them to faithful counsel. 
There is a man in our own days whose words 
are not framed to tickle delicate ears; who, to 
my thinking, comes before the great ones of 
society much as the son of Imlah came before 
the throned kings of Judah and Israel; and who 
speaks truth as deep, with a power as prophet- 
like and as vital—a mien as dauntless and as 
daring. Is the satirist of ‘‘Vanity Fair’’ admired 
in high places? I ean not tell; but I think if some 
of those amongst whom he hurls the Greek-fire of 
his sarcasm, and over whom he flashes the levin-

warnitigs in time—they or their seed might yet 
escape a fatal Ramoth-Gilead.

OF HISTORY AS A SCIENCE?’ 
‘Wat is History,’’ said Napoleon, ‘‘but a 
fiction agreed upon?’’. ‘‘My friend,’’ said Faust 
to. the student, who was growing enthusiastic 
about the spirit of past ages,—‘‘my friend, the 
‘times whieh are gone -are a book with seven 
seals;.and what you call the spirit of past ages 
is but the spirit of this or that worthy gentle 
man in whose mind those ages are reflected.’’ 
One lesson, and only one, history may be said 
to repeat with distinetness; that the worid is 
‘ built somehow on moral foundations; that, in 
the long run, it is well with the good; in the long run it is U1 with the wicked. But this is no

  science; it is no more than the old doctrine taught 
long ago by the Hebrew prophets. The theories 
of M. Comte and his disciples advance us, after 
all, not a step beyond the trodden and familiar 
ground. If men are not entirely animals, they 
are at least half animals, and are subject in this 
aspect of them to the conditions of animals. §8o' 
far as those parts of man’s doings are concerned, . 
which neither have, nor need have, anything 
moral about them, so far the laws of him are 
calculable. There are laws for his digestion, and 
laws of the means by which his digestive organs 
are supplied with matter. But pass beyond them, 
and where are we? In a world where it would 
be as easy to caleulate men’s actions by laws 
like those of positive philosophy as:to measure 
the orbit of Neptune with a foot rule, or weigh 
Sirius in a grocer’s scale. 
And it is not difficult to see why this should - 
be. The first principle, on which the theory of 
a seience of history ean be plausibly argued, is 
that all actions whatsoever arise from self- 
interest. It may be enlightened self-interest, it 
may be unenlightened; but it is assumed as an 
axiom that every man, in whatever he does, is 
aiming at something which he considers will 
promote his happiness. His conduct is not de- 
termined by his will; it is determined by the 
object of his desire. Adam Smith, in laying the 
foundations of political economy, expressly elimi- 
nates every other motive. He does not say that 
men never act on other motives; still less, that 
they never ought to act on other motives. He 
asserts merely that, as far as the arts of pro- 
duction are concerned and of buying and selling, 
123
-P-A-G-E-137
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD'S CLASSICS bien 
.the action of self-interest may be counted upon 
as uniform. What Adam Smith says of political 
economy, Mr. Buckle* would extend over the 
whole circle of human activity. 
Now, that which especially distinguishes a high 
order of man from a low order of man—that 
which constitutes human goodness, human great- 
ness, human nobleness—is surely not the degree 
of enlightenment with which men pursue their 
own advantage; but it is self-forgetfulness; it is 
self-sacrifice ; it is the disregard of personal pleas- 
‘are, personal indulgence, personal advantages re- 
mote or present, because some other line of con- 
duct is more right. 
We are sometimes told that this is but another 
way of expressing the same thing; that, when a 
man prefers doing what is right, it is only be- 
eause to do right gives him’a higher satisfaction. 
It appears to me, on the contrary, to be a differ- 
-enee in-the very heart.and nature of things. The 
martyr: goes to the stake, the patriot to the 
seaffold,. not’ with a view to any future reward 
to themselves, but because it is a glory to fling 
‘away their lives for truth and freedom. And so 
through all phases of existence, to the smallest 
 details:of common life, the beautiful character is 
the ‘unselfish character. Those whom we most 
love and admire are those to. whom the thought 
of self seems never to occur; who do simply and 
with no ulterior aim—with no thought whether 
it will be pleasant to themselves or unpleasant 
—-that which is good and right and generous. 
- | Is this still selfishness, only more enlightened?

  is neglect of self. Let the thought of self pass 
in, and the beauty of a great action ‘is‘gone, 
like the bloom from a soiled flower. Surely it is 
a paradox to speak of the self-interest of a 
martyr who dies fo. a eause, the triumph of which 
he will never enjoy; and the greatest of that 
great company in all ages would have done what 
they did, had their personal prospects closed 
with the grave. Nay, there have been those 
so zealous for some glorious principle as to wish 
themselves blotted out of the book of Heaven 
if the cause of Heaven could succeed. 
And out of this mysterious quality, whatever 
it be, arise the higher relations of human life, 
the higher modes of human obligation. Kant, 
the philosopher, used to say that there were. 
two things which overwhelmed him with awa 
as he thought of them. One was the star-sown 
deep of space, without limit and without end; 
the other was right and wrong. Right, the 
sacrifice of self to good; wrong, the sacrifice 
of good to self,—not graduated objects of desire, 
to which we are determined by the degrees of 
our knowledge, but wide asunder as pole and 
pole, as light and darkness; one, the object of 
infinite love; the other, the object of infinite de- 
testation and scorn. It is in this marvelous power » 
in men to do wrong (it is an old story, but 
none the less true for that),—it is in this power 
to do wrong—wrong or right, as it lies somehow 
with ourselves to choose—that the impossibility 
stands of forming scientific caleulations of what 
men will do before the fact, or scientific ex- 
planations of what they have done after the fact. 
If men were consistently selfish, you might ana-

“lyze. their motives; if they were consistently 
noble, they would express.in their’ conduct the 
laws of the highest perfection. But so long as 
two natures are mixt together, and the strange 
ereature which results from the combinations is 
now under one influence and now under another, 
so long you will make nothing of him except 
from the old-fashioned moral—or, if you please, 
imaginative—point of view. 
Even the laws of political economy itself 
cease to guide us when they touch moral govern- 
ment. So long as labor is a chattel to be bought 
and sold, so long, like other commodities, it fol- 
lows the condition of supply and demand. But 
if, for his misfortune, an employer considers 
that he stands in human relations to his work- 
men; if. he believes rightly or wrongly, that he is 
responsible for them; that in return for their 
labor he is bound to see that their children are 
decently taught, and they and their families 
decently fed and clothed and lodged; that he 
ought .to care for them in sickness and in old 
then political economy will no longer 
direct him, and the relations between himself 
and his dependents will have to be arranged on 
quite ‘other principles. 
So long as he considers only his own material 
profit, so long supply and demand will settle 
every difficulty; but the introduction of a new 
factor spoils the equation. 
And it is precisely in this debatable ground 
_ of low motives and noble emotions; in the 
struggle, ever failing yet ever renewed, to carry 
truth and justice into the administration of 
human ‘society; in the establishment of states and

‘fora better order of things? Anyhow, the 
‘fountain out of which the race is flowing per-

. Whether there is a change in the organization 
itself we can not tell; but this is certain,—that, 
as the planet varies with the atmosphere which 
surrounds it, so each new generation varies from 
the last, because it inhales as its atmosphere the 
accumulated experience and knowledge of the 
whole-past of the world. These things form the

  he had commenced with persecuting; yet it was 
with the honest inconsistency which distinguishes 
the conduct of most men of. practical ability in 
times of change, and even by virtue of which 
they obtain their success. If at the commence- 
ment of the movement he had -regarded the eu+ 
charist as a ‘‘remembranee,’’ he must either . 
have concealed his convictions or he would have 
forfeited his throne; if he had been a stationary —

a century, and would have been conquered. only 
by an internecine war. - 
But as the. nation moved the King .moved, 
leading it, but not outrunning it; checking those 
who went too fast, dragging forward those who 
lagged behind. The conservatives, all that was 
sound and good among them, trusted him because 
he so long continued to share their conservatism ; 
when he threw it aside he was not reproached | 
with breach of confidence, because his own ad-.. . 
vance had accompanied theirs. 
Protestants have exclaimed against the Six 
Articles bill; Romanists against the Act of Su-

opinions should have been allowed to be free, 
and the reform of religion have been left to be

  was who raised the House of Commons from the 
narrow duty of voting supplies, and .of passing 
without discussion the measures of the Privy 
Council, and converted them into the first power 
in the State under the Crown. When he ascended 
the throne, so little did the Commons care for 
their privileges that their attendance at the ses- 
sions of Parliament was enforced by a law. They’ 
woke into life in 1529, and they became the right 
hand of the King to subdue the resistance of the 
House of Lords, and to force upon them a course 
of legislation which from their hearts they de- 
tested. Other kings in times of diffieulty sum- 
moned their ‘‘great councils,’’ composed of peers, 
or prelates, or municipal officials, or any persons: 
whom they pleased to nominate. Henry VIII 
broke through the ancient practise, and ever 
threw himself on the representatives of the peo- 
ple. By the Reformation and by the power which 
he forced upon them he had so interwoven the 
House of Commons with the highest business 
of the state that the peers thenceforward sunk 
to be their shadow. 
Something, too, ought to be said of his individu- 
al exertions in the details of state administra- 
tion. In his earlier life, tho aetive and assiduous, 
he found leisure for elegant accomplishments, 
for splendid amusements, for relaxations careless, 
extravagant, sometimes questionable. As his life 
drew onward, his lighter tastes disappeared, and 
the whole energy of his intellect was prest into 
the business of the commonwealth. Those. who 
have examined the printed state papers may 
form some impression of his industry from: the

  manded the offender’s soul, and it seemed as 
if merey itself could not refuse him: the award. 
But at the last moment the Supreme Judge inter- 
fered. The emperor, He said, had been sent: 
into the world at a peculiar time, for a peculiar .° 
purpose, and was not to be tried by the ordinary 
rules. Titian has painted the scene: Charles: 
kneeling before the throne, with the conscious-} 
ness, as became him, of human infirmities written’ 
upon his countenance, yet neither afraid nor 
abject, relying in absolute faith that the Judge 
of all mankind would do right. 
Of Cesar too it may be said that he came into 
the world at a special time and for a special’ 
object. The old religions were dead, from the 
Pillars of Hereules to the Euphrates and the 
Nile, and the principles on which human society 
had been constructed were dead also. There 
remained of spiritual conviction only the common 
and human sense of justice and morality; and 
out of this sense some ordered system of govern- 
ment had-to be constructed, under which quiet 
men could live and labor and eat the fruit of 
their industry. Under a rule of this material 
kind there ean be no enthusiasm, no chivalry, 
no saintly aspirations, no patriotism of the he- 
roic type. It was not to last forever. A new 
life was about to dawn for mankind. Poetry, 
and faith, and ‘devotion were to spring again 
out of the seeds which were sleeping in the heart 
of humanity. 
But the life which is to endure grows slowly; 
and as the soil must be prepared before the 
wheat can be sown, so before the kingdom of 
heaven could throw up its shoots there was

Hons were neither torn in pieces. by violence nor 
“were rushing after false ideals and spurious ambi- 
tions. Such. a kingdom was the empire of the 
Cesars—a. kingdom. where peaceful men could 
work, think, and. speak as they pleased, and travel 
freely, among ‘provineés ruled for the most part 
by, Gallios who proteeted life and property, and 
forbade. fanaties to tear each other i in pieces for 
their religious opinions. ‘‘It is not lawful for 
us to put any, man to death,’’ was the complaint

‘Had. Europe and Asia been covered with in- 
dependent nations, each with a local religion re-

have been stifled in its cradle... If St. Paul had

haye been torn to pieces: by, the. silversmiths at

possible his success. 
And ‘this ‘spirit, which confined government to 
its simple duties, while it left opinion unfettered, 
was especially present in Julius Cesar himself. 
From cant of all kinds he was totally free. He 
was a friend of the people, but he indulged in 
no enthusiasm for liberty. He never dilated on 
the beauties of virtue, or complimented, as Cicero 
did, ‘a Providence in which he did not believe. 
He was too sincere to stoop to unreality. He 
held to the facts of this life and to his own

unmolested the creeds and practises of the un- 
counted sects or tribes who were gathered under 
the eagles. But his own writings contain nothing 
to indicate that he himself had any religious be- 
lief at all. He saw no evidence that the gods 
practically interfered in human affairs. He never 
pretended that Jupiter was on his side. He - 
thanked his soldiers after a victory, but he did 
not order Te Deums to be sung for it; and in the 
absence of these convéntionalisms he perhaps 
showed more real reverence than he could have 
displayed by the freest use of the formulas of 
pietism. 
He fought his battles to. establish some tol- 
erable degree of justice in the government of 
this world; and he succeeded, tho. he was mur- 
dered for doing it. 
Strange and startling resemblance between the ~ 
fate of the founder of the kingdom of this world 
and of the Founder of the kingdom not of this 
world fer which the first was a preparation. Hach 
was denounced for making himself a king. Each 
was maligned as the friend. of publicans and 
sinners; each was betrayed by those whom he 
had loved and cared for; each was put to death; 
and Cesar also was believed to have risen again 
and ascended into heaven and become a divine

garden of God.’ 
Her successor, like her in perfection of beauty, 
tho less in endurance of dominion, is still left 
for our beholding in the final period of her de- 
cline: a ghost upon the sands of the sea, so 
weak—so quiet—so bereft of all but her loveli- 
ness, that we might well doubt, as we watched 
her faint reflection in the mirage of the lagoon, 
which was eity and which the shadow. 
I would endeavor to trace the lines of this 
image before it be forever lost and to record, 
as far as I may, the warning which seems to 
me to be uttered by every one of the fast-gaining 
waves that beat like passing bells against the 
stones of Venice. 
It would be difficult to overrate the value of 
the lessons which might be derived from a faith- 
ful study of the history of this strange and 
mighty city; a history which, in spite of the 
labor of countless chroniclers, remains in vague 
and disputable outline—barred with brightness 
and shade, like the far-away edge of her own 
ocean, where the surf and the sand-banks are 
mingled with the sky. oa 
Venice is usually conceived as an oligarchy: 
She was so during a period less than the half 
of her existence, and that including the days of 
her decline; and it is one of the first questions 
needing severe examination, whether that decline 
was owing in anywise to the change in the form 
of her government, or altogether, as assuredly 
in great part, to changes in the character of 
the persons of whom it was composed.

  _ |The state of Venice existed thirfeen hundred 
‘and seventy-six years, from the first) establish- 
-ment of a consular government on the island of 
the Rialto to:the moment when the general-in- 
ebief of the French army of Italy’ pronounced 
the Venetian republic a thing of the past. Of 
this period, two hundred -and seventy-six years 
were, passed ‘in a nominal subjection to the cities 
of. old. Venetia, ‘especially to Padua, and in an 
agitated form of democracy of which the execu- 
tive appears to have been entrusted to tribunes, 
ehosen one by the inhabitants of each of the prin- 
cipal islands. .For six hundred years, during 
which the power of Venice was continually on 
the. increase, her government, was an elective 
monarchy, her king or doge possessing, in early 
times at least, as much independent authority 
ag any other European sovereign, but an authority 
gradually subjected to limitation, and shortened 
almost daily of its prerogatives, while it increased 
in a spectral and incapable magnificence. The 
final government of thé nobles, under the image 
of aking, lasted for five hundred years, during 
‘which: Venice reaped the fruits of her former 
‘energies, consumed them—and expired. 
" Let the reader therefore conceive the existence 
of the ‘Venetian state as broadly divided into 
. two periods: the first of nine hundred, the second 
of: five; hundred years, the separation being 
marked by what was called the ‘‘Serrar del 
Consiglio’’;'that is to say, the final and absolute 
distinction ‘of the nobles from the commonalty, 
and the establishment of the government in their 
hands to the exelusion alike of the influence of

  the people on the one side, and the authority of 
the doge on the other. oo 
Then the first period, of nine hundred years, 
presents us with the most interesting spectacle 
of a people struggling out of anarchy into order’ 
and power; and then governed, yor the most 
part, by the worthiest and noblest man whom’, 
they could find among them, called their Doge’ 
or Leader, with an aristocracy gradually and 
resolutely forming itself around him, out of 
which, and at last by which, he was chosen; an 
aristoeracy owing its origin to the accidental 
numbers, influence, and wealth of some among 
the families of the fugitives from the older Vené- 
tia, and gradually organizing itself, by its unity 
and heroism, into a separate body. 
This first period includes the rise of Venice, 
her noblest achievements, and the circumstances 
which determined her character and position 
among European powers; and within its range, 
as might have been-anticipated, we find the names 
of all her hero princes—of Pietro Urseolo, Orda- 
lafo Falier, Domenico Michieli, Sebastiano Ziani, 
and Enrico Dandolo. . 
The second period opens with a hundred and 
twenty years, the most eventful in the eareer 
of Venice—the central struggle of her life— 
stained with her darkest erime, the murder of | 
Carrara—disturbed by her most dangerous in-, 
ternal sedition, the conspiracy of Falier—opprest | 
by her most fatal war, the war of Chiozza—and. 
distinguished by the glory of her two noblest, 
citizens (for in this period the heroism of her 
citizens replaces that of her monarchs), Vittor 
Pisani and Carlo Zeno. set !

  THE’ BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  I date the commencement of the fall of Venice 
from the death of Carlo Zeno, 8th May, 1418; 
the visible commencement from. that of another 
of her noblest .and wisest children, the Doge 
Tomaso. Mocenigo, who expired five years later. 
The reign of Foseari followed, gloomy with pes- 
tilence.and war; a war in which large acquisitions 
of territory” were made by subtle or fortunate 
poliey in Lombardy, and disgrace, significant as 
irreparable, sustained in the battles on the Po 
at Cremona, and in the marshes of Caravaggio. 
Jn 1454, Venice, the first of the states of Christen- 
dom, humiliated herself to the Turk; in the same 
year was established the Inquisition of State, 
and from this period her government takes the 
perfidious and mysterious form under which it 
is usually. conceived. In 1477, the great Turkish 
invasion spread terror to the shores of the 
lagoons; and in 1508 the league of Cambrai marks 
the period usually assigned as the commencement 
of the decline of the Venetian power; the com- 
mercial prosperity of Venice in the close of the 
fifteenth century blinding her historians to the 
.previous ‘evidence of the diminution of her in- 
sternal strength. . . . 
Throughout her career the victories of Venice, 
and, at many periods of it, her safety, were 
parehased by individual heroism; and the man 
-who exajied or saved her was sometimes (often- 
est) her king, sometimes a noble, sometimes a 
citizen. ‘To him no matter nor to her; the real 
question is not. so much what names they bore, 
or with what powers they were entrusted, as 
how they were trained; how they. were made 
masters of themselves, servants of their country,

  patient of distress, impatient of dishonor; and 
what was the true reason of the change*from the 
time when she could find saviors among those 
whom she had east into prison to that when the 
voices of her own children .commanded her to 
sign covenant with death. 
The most curious phenomenon in all Venetian 
history is the vitality of religion in private life 
and its deadness in public policy. Amidst the 
enthusiasm, chivalry, or fanaticism of the other 
states of Europe, Venice stands, from first to 
last, like a masked statue; her coldness im- 
penetrable, her exertion only aroused by the 
touch of a secret spring. That spring was her 
commercial interest—this the one motive of all 
her important political acts, or enduring national 
animosities.. She could forgive insults to her 
honor, but never rivalship in her commerce; she 
calculated the glory of her conquests by their 
value, and estimated their justice by their facili-' 
ty. The fame of success remains when the mo- 
tives of attempts are forgotten; and the casual 
reader of her history may perhaps be surprized 
to be reminded that the expedition which was 
commanded by the noblest of her princes, and 
whose results added most to her military glory, 
was one in which, while all Europe around her 
was wasted by the fire of its devotion, she first 
ealculated the highest price she could exact from 
its piety for the armament she furnished, and 
then, for the advancement of her own private 
interests, at once broke her faith and betrayed 
her religion. ... . . 
There are, therefore, two strange and solemn 
lights in whieh we have to regard almost every 
VI—10 145

  ‘THE BEST OF THE WORLD'S CLASSICS 
  scene in the fitful history of the Rivo Alto. We 
find, on the one hand, a deep and constant tone 
of individual religion characterizing the lives of 
the citizens of Venice in her greatness; we find 
this spirit influencing them in all the familiar 
* and immediate concerns of life, giving a peculiar 
dignity to the conduct even of their commercial 
transactions, and confest by them with a sim- 
plicity of faith that may well put to shame the 
hesitation with which a man of the world at 
present admits (even if it be so in reality) that 
religious feeling has any influence over the minor 
branches of his conduct. And we find as the 
_ natural consequence of all this, a healthy serenity. 
of mind and energy of will exprest in all their 
actions, and a habit of heroism which never fails 
them, even when the immediate motive of action 
ceases to be praiseworthy. With the fulness of this 
spirit the prosperity of the state is exactly corre- 
spondent, and with its failure her decline. . . 
I have said that the two orders, Dorie and 
Corinthian, are the roots of all European archi- 
tecture. You have, perhaps, heard of five orders: 
but: there are only two real orders; and there 
never can be any more until doomsday. On one 
of these orders the ornament is convex: those 
aré Dorie, Norman, and what else you recollect of 
the kind. On the other the ornament is concave: 
those are Corinthian, Early English, Decorated, 
and what else you recollect of that kind. The 
transitional ‘form, in which the ornamental line 
is straight, is the center or root of both. Al 
other orders are varieties of these, or fantasms 
and grotesques, altogether indefinite in number 
and. species. ©

This Greek architecture, then, with its two 
orders, was clumsily copied and varied by the 
Romans with no particular result, until they 
began to bring the arch inta extensive practical 
service; except only that the Dorie capital was 
spoiled in endeavors to mend it, and the Corin- 
thian much varied and enriched with fanciful, 
and often very beautiful imagery. And in this 
state of things came Christianity: seized upon 
the arch as her own; decorated it, and delighted 
in it: invented a new Dorie capital to replace 
the spoiled Roman one: and all over the Roman 
Empire set to work, with such materials as were 
nearest at hand, to express and adorn herself 
as best she could. This Roman Christian archi- 
tecture is the exact expression of the Christianity 
of the time, very fervid and beautiful—but very 
imperfect; in many respects ignorant, and yet 
radiant with a strong, childlike light of imagina- 
tion, which flames up under Constantine, illumines 
all the shores of the Bosporus and the Avgean 
and the Adriatic Sea, and then gradually, as the 
people give themselves up. to idolatry, becomes 
corpse-like. The architecture sinks into a settled 
form—a strange, gilded, and embalmed repose: 
it, with the religion it exprest; and so would 
have remained forever—so does remain where its 
languor has been undisturbed. But rough wa- 
kening was ordained for it. . 
The Christian art of the declining empire is 
divided into two great branches, western and 
eastern; one centered at Rome, the other at 
Byzantium, of which the one is the early Chris- 
tian Romanesque, properly so called, and the 
other, carried to higher imaginative perfection 
147

  THE BEST OF THE WORLD'S CLASSICS 
  ~ by Greek workmen, is distinguished from it as 
Byzantine. But I wish the reader, for the pres- 
ent, to class these two branches of art together 
in his mind, they being, in points of main im- 
portance, the same; that is to say, both of them 
a true continuance and sequence, of the art of 
old Rome itself, flowing uninterruptedly down 
from the fountain-head, and entrusted always to 
the .best workmen who could be found—Latins 
in Italy and: Greeks.in Greece; and thus both 
branches may be ranged under the general term 
of Christian Romanesque, an architecture which 
had lost the refinement of pagan art in the 
degradation of the empire, but which was elevated 
by Christianity to higher aims, and by the fancy 
of the Greek workmen endowed with brighter 
forms. And this art the reader may conceive 
‘as extending in its -varigus branches over all the 
eentral provinces of the empire, taking aspects 
more or less refined, according to its proximity 
to. the seats of government; dependent for all 
its“power on the vigor and freshness of ‘the reli- 
gion which animated it; and. as that vigor and 
purity departed, losing its own vitality, and 
sinking into nerveless rest, not deprived of. its 
beauty, but benumbed, and incapable of advance 
or change. 
Meantime there had been ‘preparation for its 
renewal. While in Rome and Constantinople, and 
in the districts under their immediate influence, 
this Roman art of pure descent was practised 
in all. its refinement, an impure form of it—a 
patois of _Romanesque—was carried by inferior 
workmen into distant provinces; and still ruder 
imitations of this patois were executed by the 
148
-P-A-G-E-162
  JOHN RUSKIN 
  barbarous nations on the skirts of the empire. 
But these barbarous nations were in the strength 
of their youth; and while, in the center of Hu- 
rope, a refined and purely descended art was 
sinking into graceful formalism, on its confines 
a barbarous and borrowed art was organizing 
itself into strength and consistency. The reader 
must therefore consider the history of the work 
of the period as broadly divided into two great 
heads; the one embracing the elaborately languid 
suecession of the Christian art of Rome; and the 
other the imitations of it executed by nations 
in every conceivable phase ‘of early organization, 
on the edges of the empire, or included in its 
now merely nominal extent. . 
Some of the barbarie nations were, of course, 
not susceptible of this influence; and, when they 
burst over the Alps, appear, like the Huns, as 
scourges only, or mix, as the Ostrogoths, with the 
enervated Italians, and give physical strength 
to the mass with which they mingle, without 
materially affecting its intellectual character. But 
others, both south and north of the empire, had 
felt its influence, baek to the beach of the Indian 
Ocean on the one hand, and to the ice creeks 
of the North Sea on the other. On the north and 
west the influence was of the Latins; on the 
south and east, of the Greeks. Two nations, pre- 
eminent above all the rest, represent to us the 
force of derived mind on either side. As the 
central power is eclipsed, the orbs of reflected 
light gather into their fulness; and when sen- 
suality and idolatry had done their work, and 
the religion of the empire was laid asleep in a 
glittering sepulcher, the living light rose upon 
‘149

  “both horizons, and the fierce swords of the 
“Lombard and Arab were shaken over its golden 
paralysis. 
The work of the Lombard was to give hardi- 
hood and’ system to the enervated body and 
enfeebled mind of Christendom; that of the Arab 
was (o punish idolatry, and to proclaim the 
spirituality of. worship. The Lombard covered 
every, church which he built with the sculptured 
representations of bodily exereises—hunting and 
war, -The Arab banished all imagination of crea- 
ture form from his temples, and proclaimed from 
their minarets ‘‘There is no god but God.’” Op- 
posité in their character and mission, alike in 
their magnificence of energy, they came from 
the North and from the South, the glacier torrent 
and the lava stream; they met and contended 
over the wreck of the Roman empire; and the 
very center of the struggle, the point of pause 
of both, the dead water of the opposite eddies, 
charged with embayed fragments of the Roman 
‘wreck, is Venice. 
The ducal palace of Venice contains the three 
elements in exactly equal proportions—the Ro- 
man,’ Lombard, and Arab. It is the central 
building of the world.

BeyonD those troops of ordered arches there 
rises a vision out of the earth, and all the great 
square seems to have opened from it in a kind 
of awe, that we may see it far away; a multitude 
of pillars and white domes, clustered into a long 
low pyramid of colored light; a treasure heap, 
it seems, partly of gold and partly of opal and 
mother-of-pearl, hollowed beneath into five great 
vaulted porches, ceiled with fair mosaic and 
beset with sculpture of alabaster, clear as amber | 
and delicate as ivory—sculpture fantastic and 
involved, of palm-leaves and lilies, and grapes 
and pomegranates, and birds clinging and fiut- 
tering among the branches, all twined together

and in the midst of it the solemn forms of angels,

back from them, revealing line after line of azure 
undulation, as a receding tide leaves the waved 
sand; their capitals rich with interwoven tracery, 
rooted knots of herbage, and drifting leaves of 
acanthus and vine, and mystical signs, all be- 
ginning and ending in the Cross; and above them, 
in the broad archivolts, a continuous chain of 
language and of life—angels, and the sighs of 
' heaven, and the labors of men, each in its ap- 
pointed season upon the earth; and above these, 
another range of glittering pinnacles, mixt with 
white arches edged with scarlet flowers—a con- 
fusion of delight, amidst which the breasts of 
the Greek horses are seen blazing in their breadth 
of golden strength, and the St. Mark’s Lion, 
lifted on a blue field eovered with stars: until 
at last, as if in ecstasy, the crests of the arches 
break into a marble foam, and toss themselves far 
into the blue sky in flashes and wreaths of sculp- 
tured spray, as-if the breakers on the Lido shore 
had- been frost-bound before they fell, and the 
sea-nymphs had inlaid them with coral and ame- 
thyst. :

  And what effect has this splendor on those who 
pass beneath it? You may walk from sunrise 
to sunset, to and fro, before the gateway of 
St. Mark’s, and you will not see an eye lifted 
to it, nor a-countenance brightened by it. Priest 
and layman, soldier and civilian, rich and poor, 
pass by it alike regardlessly. Up to the very 
recesses of the porches, the meanest tradesmen 
of the city push their counters; nay, the founda- 
tions of its pillars are themselves the seats, not 
‘‘of them that sell doves’’ for sacrifice, but of 
the venders of toys and caricatures. Round the 
whole square in front of the church there is 
almost a continuous line of. cafés, where the idle 
Venetians of the middle classes lounge and read 
empty journals; in its center the Austrian bands 
play during the time of vespers their martial 
musi¢ jarring with the organ notes—the march 
drowning the miserere and the sullen crowd thick- 
ening. round them—a crowd which if it had its 
will would stiletto every soldier that pipes to it. 
And in the recesses of the porches, all day long, 
knots of men of the lowest classes, unemployed 
and listless, lie basking in the sun like lizards; 
and unregarded children—every heavy glance of 
their young eyes full of desperation and stony 
depravity and their throats hoarse with cursing—

We are in a low vaulted room; vaulted not with 
arehes, but with small cupolas starred with gold 
and checkered with gloomy figures: in the center 
is a.bronze font charged with rich bas-reliefs; 
a small figure of the Baptist standing above it 
in a single ray of light, that glances across the 
narrow room, dying as it falls from a window 
high in the wall—and the first thing that it 
strikes, and the only thing that it strikes brightly, 
is a tomb. We hardly know if it be a tomb 
indeed: for it is like a narrow couch set beside 
the window, low-roofed and curtained; so that it 
might seem, but that it has some height above 
the pavement, to have been drawn toward the 
window, that the sleeper might be wakened early

curtain back, and are looking down upon him.

years, when St became the last Christian stronghold in Pales-

gularly small and delicate, the lips sharp—per- 
haps the sharpness of death being added to that 
of the natural lines; but there is a sweet smile 
upon them, and a deep serenity upon the whole 
countenance. The roof of the canopy above has 
been blue, filled with stars; beneath, in the center 
of the tomb on which the figure rests, is a seated 
figure of the Virgin, and: the border of it all 
around is of flowers and soft leaves, growing

It is the Doge Andrea Dandolo; a man early 
great among the great of Venice, and early lost. 
She chose him for her king in his thirty-sixth 
year; he died ten years later, leaving behind him 
that history to which we owe half of what we 
know of her former fortunes. 
Look round at the room in which he lies. The 
floor of it is of rich mosaic, encompassed by a low 
seat of red marble; and its walls are of alabaster, 
but worn: and shattered and. darkly stained with 
age, almost a ruin—in places the slabs of marble 
have fallen away altogether, and the rugged 
brickwork is seen through’ the’ rents: but ‘all 
beautiful—the ravaging fissures fretting’ their

the alabaster and the time stains on its trans- 
lucent masses darkened into fields of rich golden .

altho in the recesses of the aisles and chapels, 
when the mist of the incense hangs heavily, we 
may see continually a figure traeed in faint lines 
upon their marble—a woman standing with her 
eyes raised to heaven, and the inscription above 
her ‘‘Mother of God’’—she is not here the pre-

and always, burning in the center of the temple; 
and every dome and hollow of its room has the 
figure of Christ in the utmost height of it, raised 
in power, or returning in judgment. 
Nor is this interior without effect on the minds 
of the people. At every hour of the day there 
are groups collected before the various shrines, 
and solitary worshipers scattered through the 
darker places of the church—evidently in prayer 
both deep and reverent, and for the most part 
profoundly sorrowful. The devotees at the greater 
number of the renowned shrines of Romanism 
may be seen murmuring their appointed prayers 
with .wandering eyes and unengaged gestures:

veiled figure enter beneath the Arabian porch,

OF WATER* 
Or all inorganie substances, acting in their 
own proper nature, and without assistance or 
combination, water is the most wonderful. If 
we think of it as the course of all the changeful- 
ness and beauty which we have seen in 
clouds; then as the instrument by which the 
earth we have contemplated. was modeled into 
symmetry, and its erags chiseled into grace; then 
as, in the form of snow, it robes the mountains 
it has made with that transcendent light which 
we could not have conceived if we had not seen; 
then as it exists in the foam of the torrent—in 
the iris which spans it, in the morning mist which 
rises from it, in the deep crystalline pools which 
mirror its hanging shore, in the broad lake and 
glancing river; finally, in that which is to all 
human minds the best emblem of unwearied, un- 
eonquerable power, the wild, various, fantastic, 
tameless unity of the sea; what shall we compare 
to this mighty, this universal element, for glory 
and for beauty? or how shall we follow its 
eternal changefulness of feeling: It is like trying 
to paint a soul. 
To suggest the ordinary appearance of calm 
water—to lay on canvas as much evidence of 
surface and reflection as may make us understand 
that water is meant—is, perhaps, the easiest task 
of art; and even ordinary running or falling

surface, or to give the forms and fury of water

and rocket-like velocity of a noble cataract, or 
the precision and grace of the séa wave, so ex- 
quisitely modeled, tho so mockingly transient 
——so mountainous in its form, yet so cold-like 
in its motion—with its variety and delicacy of 
color, when every ripple and wreath has some 
peculiar passage of reflection upon itself alone, 
and the radiating and scintillating sunbeams are 
mixt with the dim hues of transparent depth and 
dark rock below ;—to do this perfectly is beyond 
the power of man; to do it even partially, has 
been granted to but one or two, even of those 
few who ‘have dared to attempt it. . . . 
Now, the fact is, that there is hardly a roadside 
pond or pool which has not as much landseape in 
it as ‘ahove it. It is not the brown, muddy, dull

When water, not in very great body, rans nm 
a rocky bed much interrupted by hollows, so that 
it can rest every now and then in a pool as it 
goes along, it does not acquire a continuous 
velocity of motion. It pauses after every leap, 
and eurdles about, and rests a little, and then 
goes on again; and if in this comparatively tran- 
quil and rational state of mind it meets with any 
obstacle, as a rock or stone, it parts on each 
side of it with a little bubbling foam, and goes 
round; if it comes to-a step in its bed, it leaps 
it lightly, and then after a little splashing at 
the bottom, stops again to take breath. But if 
its bed be on a continuous slope, not much inter- 
rupted by hollows, so that it can not rest, or if 
its own mass be so increased by flood that its 
usual resting-places are not sufficient for it, but 
that it is perpetually pushed out of them by the 
following eurrent, before it has had time to 
tranquilize itself, it of course gains velocity with 
every yard that it runs; the impetus got at one 
leap is carried to the credit of the next, until the 
whole stream betomes one mass of unchecked, 
_aceelerating motion. Now when water in: this 
state comes to an obstacle, it does not part at 
it but clears it, like a race-horse; and when it 
comes te a hollow, it does not fill it up and run out 
leisurely at the other side, but it rushes down into it 
and comes up again on the other side, as a ship into 
the hollow of the sea. Hence, the whole ap- 
pearance of the bed of the stream is changed, 
and all the lines of the water altered in their 
nature. The quiet stream is a succession of leaps 
162

  and pools; the leaps are light and springy, and 
parabolic, and make a great deal of splashing 
_ when they tumble into the pool; then we have 
a space of quiet curdling water, and another 
similar leap below. ~ 
But the stream when it has gained an impetus 
takes the shape of. its bed, never stops, is equally 
deep and equally swift everywhere, goes down 
into every hollow, not with a leap, but with a 
swing, not foaming, nor splashing, but in the 
bending line of a strong sea-wave, and comes up 
again on the other side, over rock and ridge, 
with the ease of a bounding leopard; if it meet 
a rock three or four feet above the level of its 
bed, it will neither part nor foam, nor express 
any concern about the matter, but clear it ina ~ 
smooth dome of water, without apparent exer- 
tion, coming down again as smoothly on the other 
side; the whole surface of the surge being drawn 
into parallel lines by its extreme velocity, but 
foamless, except in places where the form of the 
bed opposes itself at some direct angle to such 
a line of fall, and causes a breaker; so that the 
whole river has the appearance of a deep and 
raging sea, with this only difference that the 
torrent-waves always break backward, and sea- 
waves forward. .

foot or two Jong each ;. the surges themselves are 
full of foam in their very bodies, underneath, 
making them white all through, as the water is 
under a great cataract; and their masses, being 
thus half water and half air, are torn to pieces 
by the wind whenever they rise, and earried 
away, in. roaring smoke, which chokes and 
strangles like actual water. Add to this, that 
when the air has been exhausted of its moisture 
by long rain, the spray of the sea is caught by 
it as deseribed above, and covers its surface not 
merely with ‘the smoke of finely divided water, 
but with boiling mist; imagine also the low rain- 
clouds brought down to the very level of the sea, 
as I have often seen them; whirling and flying 
in ‘rags and fragments from wave to wave; and

madness, lifting themselves. in precipices and

  But, I think, the noblest sea that Turner has 
ever painted, and, if so, the noblest certainly 
ever painted by man, is that of the Slave Ship,’ 
the chief Academy picture of the Exhibition in 
1840. It is a sunset on the Atlantic, after pro- 
longed storm; but the storm is partially lulled, 
and the torn and streaming rain-clouds are mov- 
ing in scarlet lines to lose themselves in the hol- 
low of the night. The whole surface of sea-in- 
eluded in the picture is divided into two ridges 
of enormous swell, not high, nor local, but.a low, 
broad heaving of the whole ocean, like the lifting 
of its bosom by deep drawn breath after the 
torture of the storm. Between these two ridges 
the fire of the sunset falls along the trough of 
the sea, dyeing it with an awful but glorious 
light, the intense and lurid splendor which burns 
like gold, and bathes like blood. Along this fiery 
path and valley, the tossing waves by which the 
swell of the sea is restlessly divided, lift them- 
selves in dark, indefinite, fantastic forms, each 
casting a faint and ghastly shadow behind it 
along the illumined foam. They do not rise 
everywhere, but three or four together in wild 
groups, fitfully and furiously, as the under 
strength of the swell compels or permits them; 
leaving between them treacherous spaces of level 
and whirling water, now lighted with green and 
lamp-like fire, now flashing back the gold of the 
declining sun, now fearfully dyed from above 
with the indistinguishable images of the burning

false or morbid hue in eny part or line, and so 
modulated that every square inch of canvas is a 
‘perfect ‘composition ; its drawing as accurate as 
fearless; the ship buoyant, bending, and full of 
motion; its tones as true as they are wonderful;

that ‘the force necessary to turn it on its hinges 
would be likely to pull down the square stone-

by putting our eyes close to the rusty bars of the 
gate, we can see the house well enough, and all 
but the very corners of the grassy inclosure. 
It is a very fine old place, of red brick, softened 
by a pale powdery lichen, which has dispersed 
itself with happy irregularity, so as to bring the 
red brick into terms of friendly companionship 
with the limestone ornaments surrounding the

The history of the house is plain now. It was

hood, got merged in the more territorial name of 
Donnithorne. It was once the Hall; it is now 
the Hall Farm. Like the life in some coast town 
that was once a watering-place, and is now a port, 
where the genteel streets are silent and grass- 
grown, and the docks and warehouses busy and 
resonant, the life at the Hall has changed its 
focus, and no longer radiates from the parlor, 
but from the kitchen and the farm-yard.

a sow with her brood, all very muddy as to the

herd has. chosen for having. the whittaws, since 
the morning turned out so wet; and Mrs. Poyser 
has. spoken her mind prefty strongly as to the 
dirt. which the extra number of men’s shoes 
brought into the house at dinner-time. Indeed, 
she has not yet recovered her equanimity on the 
subject, tho it is now nearly three hours since

again; as clean as everything else in that wonder- 
ful house-place, where the only chance of collect- 
ing a few grains of dust would be to climb on the 
salt-coffer, and put your finger on the high mantel 
shelf on which the glittering brass candlesticks

  else could an oak clock-case and an oak table have 
got to such a polish by the hand: genuine ‘‘elbow 
polish,’’ as Mrs. Poyser called it, for she thanked 
God she never had any of your varnished rubbish 
in her house. Hetty Sorrel often took the oppor- 
tunity, when her aunt’s back was turned, of look- 
ing at the pleasing reflection of herself in those 
polished surfaces, for the oak table was usually 
turned up like a screen, and was more for orna- . 
ment than for use; and she could see herself 
sometimes in the great round pewter dishes that 
were ranged on the shelves above the long deal 
dinner-table, or in the hobs of the grate, which 
always shone like jasper. © 
Everything was looking at its brightest at this 
moment, for the sun shone right on the pewter 
dishes, and from their reflecting surfaces pleasant 
jets of light were thrown on mellow oak and 
bright brass;—and on a still pleasanter object 
than these; for some of the rays fell on Dinsh’s 
finely molded cheek and lit up her pale-red hair 
to auburn, as she bent over the heavy household 
linen which she was mending for her aunt. Na 
scene could have been more peaceful, if Mrs. 
Poyser, who was ironing a few things that still 
remained from the Monday’s wash, had not been 
making a frequent clinking with her iron, and ~ 
moving to and fro whenever she wanted it to cool; 
carrying the keen glance of her blue-gray eye 
from the kitchen to the dairy, where Hetty was 
making up the butter, and from the dairy to the 
back kitchen, where Nancy was taking the pies 
out of the oven. Do not suppose, however, that

“rise of subdivisions, severally become more co- 
herent within themselves and more definitely 
marked off. The process parallels completely that 
by which the paris of an individual organism pass 
from their initial state of simplicity to their ulti- 
mate state of complexity. 
Originally one who was believed by himself and 
others te have power over demons—the mystery- 
man or medicine-man—using coercive methods to 
expel disease-producing spirits, stood in the place 
of doctor; and when his appliances, at first sup- 
posed to act supernaturally, came to be under- 
stood as acting naturally, his office eventually lost 
its priestly character altogether: the resulting 
physician class, originally uniform, eventually di- 
viding into distinguishable subclasses while 
acquiring a definite embodiment. ~ 
Less early, because implying more developed 
groups, arose those who as exhibitors of joy, now 
in the presence of the living ruler and now in the 
supposed presece of the deceased ruler, were at 
first simultaneously singers and dancers, and, be- 
‘coming ,specialized from the people at large, 
presently became distinct from one another; 
whence, in course of time, two groups of pro- 
fessionals, whose official laudations, political or 
religious, extended in their range and multiplied 
in their kinds. And then by like steps were 
separated from one another vocal and instru- 
mental musicians, and eventually composers; 
within which classes also there arose subdivisions. 
Ovations, now to the living king and now to the 
dead king, while taking saltatory and musical 
forms, took also verbal forms, originally spon-

  taneous and irregular, but presently studied and 
measured; whenee, first, the unrhythmical speech © 
of the orator, whieh under higher emotional ex- 
citement grew into the rhythmical speech of the 
priest poet, chanting verses—verses that finally 
became established hymns of praise. Meanwhile 
from accompanying rude imitations of the hero’s’ 
acts, performed now by one and now by several, 
grew dramatie representations, which, little by 
little elaborated, fell under the regulation of a 
chief actor, who prefigured the playwright. And 
out of these germs, all pertaining to worship, 
came eventually the various professions of poets, 
actors, dramatists, and the subdivisions of these. 
The great deeds of the hero god, recited, 
chanted, or sung, and mimetically rendered, 
naturally came to be supplemented by details, so 
growing into accounts of his life; and thus the’ 
priest poet gave origin to the biographer, whose 
narratives, being extended to less sacred person- 
ages, became secularized. Stories of the apotheo- 
sized chief or king, joined with stories of his com- 
panions and amplified by narratives of accom- 
panying transactions, formed the first histories. 
And from these accounts of the doings of par- 
ticular men and groups of men, partly true but. 
passing by exaggeration into the mythical, came 
the wholly mythical, or fiction; which then and 
, always preserved the biographico-historical char- 
aeter. Add to which that out of the criticisms 
and reflections scattered through this personal 
literature an impersonal literature slowly 
emerged; the whole group of these products hav- 
ing as their deepest root the eulogies of the priest 
poet.

  «Prompted as. were the medicine-men of savages 
and the. priests of. early civilized peoples to in- 
erease their influence, they: were ever stimulated 
to acquire. knowledge .of natural actions and the 
properties. of. things; and, being in. alleged..com- 
munication with supernatural beings, they were 
supposed: to acquire such knowledge from them, 
Hence, by implication, the priest beeame the 
primitive man of science; and led by his special 
experiences to speculate about the causes of 
things; thus entered the sphere of philosophy: 
both‘his.science and his philosophy being pursued 
in ‘the service of his religion. ; 
Not only his higher culture, but his alleged 
intercourse with the gods, whose mouthpiece he 
‘was, made him the authority in cases of dispute; 
and being also, as historian, the authority con- 
cerning past transactions. and traditional usages, 
or Jaws, be acquired in. both capacities: the char- 
acter. of judge. Moreover, when the growth of 
legal administration brought the advoeate, he, tho 
usually of lay origin, was sometimes elerical. 
Distinguished in early stages as the learned 
man of,.the tribe or society, and especially dis- 
tinguished as the possessor of that knowledge 
which:.was thought of most value—knowledge of 
unseen ‘things—the priest of necessity became the 
first teacher. Transmitting traditional statements 
concerning ghosts and. gods,.at first. to neophytes 
of his .class..only, but afterward to the eultured 
classes, he presently, beyond instruction. in super- 
natural things, gave instruetion in natural things; 
and, having been the first secular teacher, has re- 
tained a large share in secular teaching even down 
to our.own days.

    As making a sacrifice was the original priestly 
act, and as the building of an altar for the sacri- 
fice was by implication a priestly act, it results 
that the making of a shelter over the altar, which 
in its developed form beeame the temple, was also 
a priestly act. When the priest, ceasing to be: 
himself the executant, directed the artificers, he. . 
continued to be the designer; and when he ceased 
to be the actual designer, the master builder or 
architect thereafter continued to fulfil his general 
directions. And then the temple and the palace 
in sundry early societies, being at once the resi- 
dence of the apotheosized ruler and the living 
ruler (even now a palace usually contains a small 
temple), and ‘being the first kinds of developed 
architecture, eventually gave origin to secular 
architecture. 
A rudely carved or modeled image of a man 
placed on his grave gave origin to the seulptured 
representation of a god inclosed in his temple. 
A product of priestly skill at the outset, it con- 
tinued in some eases to be such among early 
civilized peoples; and always thereafter, when ex- 
ecuted by an artizan, conformed to priestly direc- 
tion. Extending presently to the representation 
of other than divine and semidivine personages, it’, 
eventually thus passed into its secularized form. 
So was it with painting. At first used to com- 
plete the carved representation of the revered or 
‘worshiped personage, and being otherwise in some 
tribes used by the priest and his aids for ex- 
hibiting the tribal hero’s deeds, it long remained 
subservient to religion, either for the coloring 
of statues (as it does still in Roman Catholic 
images of saints, etc.), or for the decoration of

  temples, or for the portraiture of deceased per- 
sons on sarcophagi and stele; and when it gained 
independence it was long employed almost wholly 
for the rendering of sacred scenes,—its eventual 
secularization being accompanied by its subdivi- 
sion into a variety of kinds and of the executant 
artists into correlative groups. 
Thus the'process of professional evolution be- 
trays throughout the same traits. In stages like 
that deseribed by Huc® as still existing among the 
Tibetans, where ‘‘the Lama is not merely a priest, 
he is the painter, poet, sculptor, architect, phy- 
sieian,’’ there are joined in the same individual, — 
or group of individuals, the potentialities out of 
which gradually arise the specialized groups we 
know as professions. While out of the one primi- 
tive class there come by progressive divergences 
many classes, each of these classes itself under- 
goes a kindred change: there are formed in it 
subdivisions and even sub-subdivisions, which be- 
come gradually more marked; so that, throughout, 
the advance is from an indefinite homogeneity to 
a definite heterogeneity. 
In presence of the fact that the immense ma- 
jority. of mankind adhere pertinaciously to the 
ereeds, political and religious, in which they are 
brought up; and in presence of the farther fact 
that on behalf of their creeds, however acquired, 
there ‘are soon enlisted prejudices which prac- 
tically shut out adverse evidence, it is not to be 
expected that the foregoing illustrations, even

  will make them see that society is a growth and 
not a manufacture, and has its laws of evolution. 
From prime ministers down to plowboys there 
is either ignorance or disregard of the truth that 
nations acquire their vital structures by natural 
processes and not by artificial devices. If the 
belief is not that social arrangements have been 
divinely ordered thus or thus, then it is that they 
have been made thus or thus by kings, or if not 
by kings, then by parliaments. That they have 
come about by small accumulated changes not con- 
templated by rulers is an open secret which only 
of late has been recognized by a few, and is still 
unperceived by the many,—educated as well as 
uneducated. Tho the turning of the land into a 
food-producing surface, cleared, fenced, drained, 
and covered with farming appliances, has been 
achieved by men working for individual profit, 
not by legislative direction—tho villages, towns, 
cities, have insensibly grown up under the desires 
of men to satisfy their wants—tho by spontaneous. 
cooperation of citizens have been formed canals, 
railways, telegraphs, and other means of com- 
munication and distribution, the natural forces 
which have don. all this are ignored as of no 
account in political thinking. 
Our immense manufacturing system with its 
multitudinous inventions, supplying both home 
and foreign consumers, and the immense mercan- 
tile marine by which its products are taken all 
over the globe and other products brought back, 
have been naturally and not artificially originated. 
That transformation by which, in thousands of 
years, men’s occupations have been so specialized 
that each, aiding to satisfy some small division

  ‘of his fellow citizen’s needs, has his own needs 
.satisfied by the work of hundreds of others, has 
taken place without design and unobserved. 
Knowledge developing into science, which has be- 
come so vast in mass that no oue can grasp a 
tithe of it, and which now guides productive ac- 
tivities at large, has resulted from the workings 
of individuals prompted not by the ruling ageney, 
‘but by their own inclinations. So, too, has been 
created the still vaster mass distinguished as 
literature, yielding the gratifications filling so 
large a space in our lives. Nor. is it- otherwise 
with the. literature of the hour. That ubiquitous 
journalism which provides satisfactions for men’s 
more urgent mental wants has resulted from the 
activities of citizens severally pursuing private 
benefits. And supplementing these come the in- 
numerable companies, associations, unions, so- 
cities, clubs, subserving enterprise, philanthropy, 
‘eulture, art, amusement; as well as the multi- 
tudinous. institutions annually receiving millions 
by: endowments and subscriptions: all of them 
-arising» from the unforced cooperations of

  like, can not be persuaded that each of these 
concessions is detrimental; but the wiser spectator 
sees that if this policy be long pursued, and be 
extended to other things, it will end in hopeless 
dependence. The teacher of the old school who 
showed his pupil the way out of every diffieulty 
did not perceive that hé was generating an atti- 
tude of mind greatly militating against success in 
life. The modern instructor, however, induees his 
upil to solve his difficulties himself; believes that 
in so doing he is preparing him to meet the diff- 
eulties which, when he goes into the world, there 
will be no one to help him through; and finds con- 
firmation for this belief in the fact that a great 
proportion of the most successful men are self- 
made. 
Well, is it not obvious that this relationship 
between discipline and success holds good 
nationally? Are not nations made of men; and 
are not men subject to the same laws of modifiea- 
tion in their adult as in their early years? Is it 
not true of the drunkard, that each carouse adds 
‘a thread to his bonds? of the trader, that each 
acquisition strengthens the wish for acquisitions? 
of the pauper, that the more you assist him the 
more ‘he wants? of the busy man, that the more 
he has to do the more he can do?) And does it not 
follow that if every individual is subject to this 
process of adaptation to conditions, a whole na- 
tion must be so-(that just in proportion as its 
members are little helped by extraneous power 
they will ‘beeome ‘self-helping, and in proportion 
as they are much helped they will become help- 
less? “yWhat folly is it to ignore these results

development than we ean elude the law of gravi- 
tation; and so long as they hold true must these 
effects occur. . 
If we are asked in what special directions this 
alleged helplessness, entailed by much state super- 
intendence, shows itself, we reply that it is seen 
in a retardation of all social growths requiring 
self-confidence in the people—in a timidity that 
fears all difficulties not before encountered—in a 
thoughtless contentment with things as they are. 
Let any one, after duly watching the rapid evolu- 
tion going on in England, where men. have been 
comparatively little helped by governments—or 
better still, after contemplating the unparalleled 
progress of the United States, which is peopled by 
self-made men and the recent descendants of self- 
made men ;—let such a one, we say, go on to the. 
Continent, and consider the relatively slow ad- 
vance which things are there making; and the still 
slower advance they would make but for English 
enterprise. 
Let him go to Holland, and.see that tho the 
Dutch early showed themselves good mechanics, 
and have had abundant practise in hydraulics, 
Amsterdam has been without any due supply of 
water until now that works are being established 
by an English company. Let him go to Berlin, 
and there be told that, to give that city a water’ 
supply such as London has had for generations, | 
the project of an English firm is about to be ex- 
eeuted by English capital, under English super- 
intendence. Let him go to Paris, where he will 
find a similar lack, and a like remedy now under

  consideration. Let him go to Vienna,-and learn 
that it, in common. with other continental cities, is 
lighted by an English gas company. Let him go 
on the Rhone, on the Loire, on the Danube, and 
discover that Englishmen established steam navi- 
gation on those rivers. Let him inquire concern- 
ing the railways in Italy, Spain, France, Sweden, 
Denmark, how many of them are English projects, 
how many have been largely helped by English 
capital, how many have been exeeuted by English 
contractors, how many have had English en- 
gineers. Let him discover, too, as he will, that 
where railways have been government made, as 
in Russia, the energy, the perseverance, and the 
praetical talent developed in England and the 
United States have been called in to aid. 
And then if these illustrations of the pro- 
gressiveness of a self-dependent race, and the 
torpidity of paternally governed ones, do not suf- 
fice him, he may read Mr.-Laing’s* successive 
volumes of European travel, and there study the 
eontrast.in detail. What, now, is the cause of 
this contrast? In the order of nature, a eapacity 
for self-help must in every case have been brought 
into existence by the practise of self-help; and, 
other things equal, a lack of this capacity must 
in every case have arisen from the lack of demand 
for. it.. Do not these two antecedents and their 
two-consequenis agree with the facts as presented 
in England and Europe? Were not the inhabit- 
ants of the two, some centuries ago, much upon 
a par in point of enterprise? Were not the Eng-

colonization, and in their commeree? Has not the 
immense relative change the English have under- 
gone in this respect been coincident with the great 
relative self-dependence’ they have been since 
habituated to? And is not this change prox- 
imately ascribable to this habitual self-depend- 
ence? Whoever doubts it is asked to assign a 
more probable cause. Whoever admits it must 
admit that the enervation of a people by perpetual 
state aids is not a trifling consideration, but the 
most weighty consideration, A general arrest of 
national growth he will see to be an evil greater 
than any speeial benefits. can compensate for. 
And, indeed, when, after contemplating this great 
fact, the overspreading of the earth by the Anglo- 
Saxons, he remarks the absence of any parallel 
phenomenon exhibited by a continental race— 
when he reflects how this difference must depend 
chiefly on difference of character, and how such 
difference of character has been mainly. produced 
by difference of discipline; he will perceive that 
the policy pursued in this matter may have a large 
share in determining a nation’s ultimate fate.

THE ORNAMENTAL AND THE USEFUL 
IN EDUCATION‘ 
Ir has been truly remarked that, in order of 
time, decoration precedes dress. Among people 
who submit to great physical suffering that they 
may have themselves handsomely tattooed, ex- 
‘tremes of témperature are borne with but little 
attempt at mitigation, Humboldt tells us that an 
Orinoco Indian, tho quite regardless of bodily 
comfort, will yet labor for a fortnight to purchase 
pigment wherewith to make himself admired; and 
that the same woman who would not hesitate to 
leave her hut without a fragment ‘of clothing on, 
would not dare to commit such a breach of de- 
corum as to go ont unpainted. Voyagers uni- 
formly find that colored beads and trinkets are 
much more prized by wild tribes than are calicoes 
or broadeloths. And the anecdotes we have of 
the. ways in which, when shirts and coats are 
given, they turn them to some ludicrous display, 
show how completely the idea of ornament pre- 
dominates over that of use. Nay, there are still 
’ more extreme illustrations: witness the fact nar-

ants, who strutted about in their goatskin mantles 
when the weather was fine, but when it was wet, 
took them off, folded them up, and went about. 
naked, shivering in the rain! Indeed, the facts 
of aboriginal life seem to indicate that dress is 
developed out of decorations. And when we re-_ 
miember that even among ourselves most think | 
more about the fineness of the fabric than its . 
warmth, and more about the eut than the con- 
venienee—when we see that the function is still 
in great measure subordinated to the appearance, 
we have further reason for inferring such an 
origin, 
It is not a little curious that the like relations 
hold with the mind. Among mental as among 
bodily acquisitions, the ornamental comes before 
the useful... Not only in times past, but almost 
as much in our own era, that knowledge whick 
conduces to personal well-being has been post- 
poned to that which brings applause. In the Greek 
schools, music, poetry, rhetoric, and a philosophy 
which, until Soerates taught, had but little bear- 
ing upon action, were the dominant subjects; 
while knowledge, aiding the arts of life, had a 
very subordinate place. And in our own uni- 
versities and schools at the present moment the 
like antithesis holds. We are guilty of something 
like a platitude when we. say that throughout his 
after eareer a boy, in nine cases. out of ten, ap- 
plies his Latin and Greek to no practical pur-. 
poses. The remark is trite that in his shop, or — 
his office, in managing his estate or his family, in 
playing his part as director of a bank or 2. rail- 
way, he is very little. aided by this knowledge 
he took so many years to aequire,—so little, that

  generally the greater part of it drops out of his 
memory; and if he oceasionally vents a Latin 
. quotation or alludes to some Greek myth, it is 
: less to throw light on the topie in hand-than for 
: the sake of effect. If we inquire what is the real 
motive for. giving boys a classical education, we 
{ find it to be simply conformity to public opinion. 
« Men dress ‘their children’s minds as they do their 
bodies, in the prevailing fashion. As the Orinoco 
Indian ‘:puts.on his. paint before leaving his hut, 
not with a.view to any direct benefit, but because 
he would be ashamed to be seen without it, so 
a boy’s drilling in Latin and Greek is insisted on, 
not beeause of their intrinsie value, but that he 
may not be disgraced by. being found ignorant of 
them—that he may have ‘‘the education of a 
gentleman’’—the badge marking a certain social 
position, and bringing a consequent respect. 
This parallel is still more clearly displayed in 
the .case ‘of the other. sex. In the treatment of 
both mind and: body, the decorative element has 
continued’ to prédominate in a greater degree 
among women than among men. Originally per- 
sonal adornment oecupied the attention of both 
sexes equally. In these latter days of civilization, 
however, we see that in the dress of men the re- 
gard for appearance has, in a considerable degree, 
yielded to the regard for comfort; while in their 
education ‘the useful has of late been trenching 
on the‘ornamental. In neither direction has this 
change ‘gone so far with. women. _The wearing of 
eatrings, finger-rings, - bracelets; the elaborate 
dressings of the hair; the still occasional use of 
paint;’the immense labor bestowed in making 
habiliments sufficiently attractive; and the great

  discomfort that will be submitted to for the sake 
of conformity; show how greatly, in the attiring 
of women, the desire of approbation overrides the 
desire for warmth and convenience. And similarly 
in their. education, the immefse preponderance of 
‘‘aceomplishments’’ proves how here, too, use is 
subordinated to display. Dancing, deportment, 
the piano, singing, drawing—what a large space ~ 
do these occupy! If you ask why Italian and 
German are learned, you will find that, under all 
the sham reasons given, the real reason is, that a 
knowledge of those tongues is thought ladylike. 
It is not that the books written in them may be. 
utilized, which they scareely ever are, but that 
Italian and German songs may be sung, and that 
the extent of att.inment may bring whispered 
admiration. The births, deaths, and marriages of 
kings, and other like historic trivialities, are com- 
mitted to memory, not because of any direct bene- 
fits that can possibly result. from knowing them, 
but because society considers them parts of a good 
education—because the absence of such knowledge 
may bring the contempt of others. When we have 
named reading, writing, spelling, grammar, arith- 
metic, and sewing, we have named about all the 
things a girl is taught with a view to their direct 
uses in life; and even some of these have more 
reference to. the good opinion of others than to 
immediate personal welfare. 
Thoroughly to realize the truth that with the 
mind as with the body the ornamental precedes 
the useful, it is needful to glance at its rationale. 
This lies in the fact that, from the far past down 
even to the present, social needs have subordi- 
nated individual needs, and that the chief social 
189

  need has been the control of individuals. It is 
not, as we commonly ‘suppose, that there are no 
governments but those of monaréhs, and parlia- 
ments, and . constituted authorities. These 
acknowledged governments are supplemented by 
other unacknowledged ‘ones, that grow up in all 
circles; in which every man or woman.strives to be 
ing or queen or lesser dignitary. To get above LQ 
some and be reverenced by them, and to propitiate 
those who are above us, is the universal struggle ~ 
in which the chief energies of life are expended. 
By the accumulation of wealth, by style of living, 
by heauty of dress, by display of knowledge or 
intellect, each tries to subjugate others, and so 
aids in weaving that ramified network of re- 
straints by which society is kept in order. It 
is not the savage chief only who, in formidable 
war paint, with scalps at his belt, aims to strike 
awe into his inferiors; it is not only the belle 
who, by elaborate toilet, polished manners, and 
numerous accomplishments, strives to ‘‘make 
conquests’’; but the scholar, the historian, the 
philosopher, use their acquirements to the same 
. end....We are none of us content with quietly 
unfolding our own individualities to the full 
in all directions, but have a restless craving to 
impress our individualities upon others, and in 
some way subordinate them. And this it is 
. which determines the character of our education. 
Not: what knowledge is of most real worth is 
the consideration, but what will bring most ap- 
plause, honor, respect—what will most conduce 
‘to social position and influence—what will be 
most imposing. As throughout life not what we 
‘are, but what we shall be thought, is the question;

value of knowledge so much as its extrinsic effects 
on others. And this being our dominant idea, 
direct utility is scarcely more regarded than by 
the barbarian when filing his teeth and staining

REMINISCENCES OF HIS BOYHOOD’ 
Puaces where I gathered flowers and gazed 
with interest at the catkins of the hazel, have 
now become places covered with ironworks, where 
steam hammers make their perpetual thuds, and 
through which railway-sidings everywhere ramify. . 
Quiet lanes in which, during early boyhood, I 
went with a companion trying to catch minnows 
with a hand-net in a clear little stream running 
by the hedge, have been transformed into straight. 
roads between land-allotments, with scattered 
houses built by artizans. And where I picked 
blackberries, factories now stand. . . . 
There was a garden of some size behind the 
house containing fruit trees, and permitting a 
certain amount of floriculture; and my father 
rented an additional piece of-land close by as 
a vegetable-garden. Not infrequently I had to 
join in gardening—more frequently, indeed, than

  T liked. Often when I ought to have beén busy 
at some ‘task which my father had set to me, 
I was otherwise oecupied—throwing stones at 
the birds that. settled onthe walls and hedges; 
observing the ‘bees on. the kidney-bean flowers, 
piercing the base of each corolla to reach the 
honey; or, at a disused pump-trough containing 
stzgnant water, watching the larve of the gnats 
as they came wriggling to the surface, putting 
out their tails to breathe, and then descending. 
Most children are instinctively naturalists, and 
were they encouraged would readily pass from 
eareless observations to careful and deliberate 
ones. My father was wise in such matters; and 
I was not simply allowed but eneouraged to enter 
on natural history. : : 
The majority of my activities, however, were 
those of the ordinary schoolboy, who, on Satur- 
day afternoons and the like occasions of leisure, 
is commonly given’ to country rambles and the 
search for hedge-side treasures. During my early 
years the neighboring regions of Osmaston and 
Normanton were explored by me in all their 
details: every hedge becoming known in the 
eourse of expeditions, now in the spring seeking 
birds’ nests, now gathering violets or .dog-roses, 
and. later in the year collecting sometimes mush- 
rooms, sometimes blackberries, sometimes hips 
and haws, crab-apples and other wild products. 
Beyond the pleasurable exercise and the gratifi- 
eation to'my love of adventure, there was gained 
during these excursions much miscellaneous 
Knowledge of things, and the perceptions were 
beneficially disciplined. Of.all the ceeupations, 
however, to which holidays were devoted, I de-

  lighted. most in fishing. There was the river 
Derwent, at that time not the black-dirty stream 
it is now, but tolerably clear and containing a 
fair supply of various fish; and there were the 
canals, which, on the whole, served better for 
boys’ fishing. Many happy half-days, and, during 
the midsummer holidays, many whole days, were 
spent on their banks. Along. with such exercise: 
of skill as fishing itself implies, there came the ' 
exercise of skill in making fishing-tackle; for 
I was not so amply furnished with pocket-money: 
that I could buy all the appliances I required. 
I was, I suspect, led by my father in that case, 
as in other cases, to use my own powers of 
manipulation for satisfying my needs. I made 
my own floats, and also ‘‘hair-tackles,’’ as they 
were locally called—each some six feet’ of the 
line next the hook, made of single horse-hair 
instead of silk-worm gut. I remember I was 
cautious and systematic enough to use a test 
before trusting any one of them. . . . 
When I was something like nine or ten years 
old, the love of this sport led very nearly to 
loss of life. I fell into deep water in the 
Derwent and was close upon drowning. It~is 
a curious fact that whereas dreams are, while in 
progress, regarded as real, the reality was in 
this case taken for a dream. During the first 
part of my immersion I thought to myselfi—‘‘ Oh, 
it is alla dream!’’; and only after coming to 
the surface once or twice discovered that I was. 
actually in the water. A youth of some sixteen 
or seventeen plunged in and reseued me. His 
name was George Holme. He was at that time 
a mill-manager. As may be inferred from the

_ Bomber of spectators who. risked himself to save 
me, he was of superior.uature morally; and he 
turned. out. in after. life'to be also a man of 
much ‘faculty. Gradually rising, he became a 
wealthy manufacturer; and was led, by the de- 
velopment. of his business, to establish trade- 
connections in various parts of the world—one 
being pushed even into Central Asia. When sixty 
‘he became mayor, of Derby and magistrate. He 
had ‘in. a-high degree that which another friend 
of mine deseribes as the business instinct—-an 
instinct which experience tells him is quite spe- 
‘Gal,.and may or may not accompany other supe- 
‘iorities. . 
T may here name the fact that I was in boy- 
hood extremely prone to castle-building—a habit 
which continued throughout youth and into ma- 
ture life: finally. passing, I suppose, into the 
dwelling on schemes more or less practicable. 
In carly days the habit was such that on going 
to bed it was asouree of satisfaction to me to 
think I should be able to lie for a length of 
time and dwell on the fancies which at the time 
: oedupied. me; and frequently next morning, on 
awaking, I was vexed with myself because I had 
goné'to‘sleep before I had reveled in my imagina- 
tions ‘as much as I had intended. Often these 
dregmis, becoming literally day-dreams, quite filled 
“my. unconsciousness when walking. Even in the 
'-streets' my state. of abstraction was such that I 
occasionally talked aloud as I went along: a   
fact of which I was from time to time made 
‘by people who turned to look at me.

A TRIBUTE TO E. L. YOUMANS* 
Some years previously I had made the ac. | 
quaintance of an American whose sympathies... 
were enlisted on my behalf by. perusal of some | 
of my books or essays—Mr. E. A. Silsbee, of 
Salem, Mass. While yet the cireular was in: 
its unfinished state, I sent to him a copy, ac- 
eompanied by the inquiry whether he thought 
that subscribers might be obtained in America. 
His reply, dated February 14, held out much. 
encouragement; and a letter of March 6, written, 
after the cireular had been sent to New York, 
eontained a sentence the significanee of which 
was shown by subsequent events. The sentence: 
runs—‘‘Mr. Youmans, a very popular and intel-' 
ligent lecturer on scientific subjects, well known 
by his works on chemistry, physiology, ete., en- 
tered with great enthusiasm into the project. ” 
Devoting himself with characteristic vigor to 
the furtherance of my scheme, this previously 
unknown friend succeeded in . obtaining more 
than two hundred subseribers.

    tunate; for Prof. Edward L. Youmans’ was of. '

  all Americans I have known or heard of, the 
one most able and most willing to help me. Alike 
intellectually and morally, he had in the highest 
degrees the traits conducive to success in dif- 
fusing the doctrines he espoused; and from that 
time to this he has devoted his time mainly 
in ‘spreading throughout the United States the 
doctrine of ‘evolution. His love of wide gen- 
eralizations had been shown years before in 
lectures. on such topics as the correlation of the 
physical forces; and from those who heard him 
I have gathered that, aided by his unusual powers 
of. exposition, the enthusiasm which eontempla- 
tion of the larger truths of science produced in 
him' ‘was in a remarkable degree communicated 
to his hearers. Such larger truths, I have on 
many ‘occasions observed, are. those which he 
quickly seizes—ever passing at once through de- 
tails to lay hold. of essentials; and having laid 
hold of them, he clearly sets them forth afresh 
in his. own way with added illustrations. But 
it is morally even'more than intellectually that 
ke has: proved himself a true missionary of ad- 
vanced ideas. Extremely energetic—so energetic 
that. no one has been able to check his over- 
activity—he has expended all his powers in ad- 
vancing ‘what he holds to be the truth; and not 
only his powers but his means. It has proved 
impossible to prevent him ‘from injuring himself 
in health by his exertions; and it has proved 
impossible to-make him pay due regard to his 
personal interests. So that toward the close of 
life he finds himsélf wrecked in body and im-

WHY HE NEVER MARRIED” 
Tuus, if I leave out altruistic considerations - 
and include egoistie considerations only, I may 
still look back from these declining days of life 
with content. One drawback indeed there has 
been, and that a great one. All through those 
years in which work should have had the accom- 
paniment of wife and children, my means were 
such as to render marriage impossible: I could 
barely support myself, much less others.. And 
when, at length, there came adequate means the 
fit time had passed by. Even in this matter, 
however, it may be that fortune has favored 
me. Frequently when prospects are promising, 
dissatisfaction follows marriage rather than satis- 
faction; and: in my own case the prospects would 
not have been promising. I am not by nature 
adapted to a relation in which perpetual com- 
promise and great forbearance are needful. That: 
extreme critical tendency which I have above 
described, joined with a lack of retitence no less 
pronouneed, wonld, I fear, lave caused per-... 
petual domestic differences. After all, my celibate 
life has probably been the best for me, as well 
as the best for some unknown other.

  and which are too often the last’ resource against 
the extravagances of tyranny. And this is all 
that Spain now possesses. The Spaniards, how-.- 
ever, resist, not because they are Spaniards, but 
because they are men. Still, even while they 
resist, they revere. While they will rise up 
against 2. vexatious impost, they crouch before ~ 
a system of which the impost is the smallest evil. 
They smite the tax-gatherer, but fall prostrate 
at the feet of the contemptible prince for whom 
the tax-gatherer plies his craft; they will even 
revile the troublesome and importunate monk, 
or sometimes they will scoff at the sleek and 
arrogant priest, while such is their infatuation 
that they would risk their lives in defense of 
that eruel Church which has inflicted on them 
hideous calamities, but to which they still cling, 
as if it were the dearest object of their affections. 
Connected with these habits of mind, and in 
sooth forming part of them, we find ‘a reverence 
for antiquity, and an inordinate tenacity of old 
opinion, old beliefs, and old habits, which remind 
us of those tropical civilizations which formerly 
flourished. Such prejudices were once universal, 
even in Europe; but they began to die out in 
the sixteenth century, and are now, comparatively 
speaking, extinct, except in Spain, where they 
have always been welcomed. In that country, 
they retain their original force, and produce their . 
natural results.. By encouraging the notion that 
all the truths most important to know are already 
known, they repress those aspirations, and dull 
that generous confidence in the future, without 
which nothing really great can be achieved. A

In this state Europe lingered for many cen-

' which, in our busy and enterprising age, isolate

Hieving that little can be done, they are in no

they have inherited is far greater than any they 
ean obtain, they wish to preserve their intellectual

the least alteration in them might lessen their 
value. Content with what has been already be-

I 
GEORGE III AND THE ELDER PITT’ 
To a superficial observer, the accession of 
George III was one of the, most fortunate events 
that could have occurred. The new king was born 
in England, spoke English as his mother tongue, 
and was said to look upon Hanover as a foreign 
country, whose interests were to be considered 
of subordinate importance. At the same time, 
the last hopes of the House of Stuart were now 
destroyed ; the Pretender himself was languishing 
in Italy, where he shortly after died: and his 
son, 2 slave to the vices which seemed hereditary 
in that family, was consuming his life in an 
‘anpitied and ignominious obscurity. 
And yet these cireumstances, which appeared 
so favorable, did of necessity involve the most 
disastrous consequences. .The fear of a disputed 
succession being removed, the sovereign was em- 
boldened to a course on whieh he otherwise would 
not have ventured. All those monstrous doctrines 
respecting the rights of kings, which the Revolu- 
tion was supposed to have destroyed, were sud- 
denly, revived. The clergy, abandoning the now

- gation in England.” -

  hopeless cause of the Pretender, displayed the 
same zeal for the House of Hanover which they 
had formerly displayed for the House of Stuart. 
The pulpits resounded with praises of the new 
king, of the domestic virtues, of his piety, but, 
above all, his dutiful attachment to the English 
Church. The result was the establishment of an 
alliance between the two parties more intimate 
than any had been seen in England since the 
time of Charles I. Under their auspices the 
old Tory faction rapidly rallied, and were soon 
able to dispossess their rivals of the management 
of the government. 
This reactionary movement was greatly aided 
by, the personal character of George IU, for he, - 
being despotic as well as superstitious, was equal- 
ly anxious to extend the prerogative and 
strengthen the church. Every liberal sentiment, 
everything approaching to reform, nay, even the 
mere mention of inquiry, was an abomination in 
the eyes of that narrow and ignorant prinee. 
Without knowledge, without taste, without even 
a glimpse of one of the sciences, or a feeling for 
one of the fine arts, edueation had done nothing 
to enlarge a mind which nature had more than 
usually contracted. Totally ignorant of the: his- 
tory and resources of foreign countries, and 
barely. knowing their geographical position, his 
information was scarcely more extensive respect- 
ing the people-over whom he was ealled to rule. 
In that immense mass of evidence now extant, 
and which consists of every description of private 
correspondence, records of private conversation 
and of public acts, there is not to be found the 
slightest proof that he knew any one of those 
205

    THE BEST OF THE WORLD'S CLASSICS 
  numerous things which the governor of a country 
ought to know; or indeed, that he was acquainted 
with a single duty of his position, except that 
mere mechanical routine of ordinary business 
‘which might have been effected by the lowest 
clerk in the meanest office in his kingdom. 
The course of proceeding which such a king 
as this was likely to follow could be easily fore- 
seen. He gathered round his throne that great 
party, who, clinging to the tradition of the past, 
have always made it their boast to check the 
progress of their age. During the sixty years 
of his reign, he, with the sole exception of Pitt, 
never willingly admitted to his councils a single 
man of great ability; not one whose name is 
associated with any measure of value either in 
domestic or in foreign policy. Even Pitt only 
maintained his position in the state by forgetting 
the-lessons of his illustrious father, and aban-

_ been educated, and with which he entered public

form, Pitt not only relinquished what he had 
before declared to be absolutely necessary, but 
did. not hesitate to persecute to the death the 
party with whom he had once associated in order 
to obtain it. Because George. III looked upon 
slavery. as one of those good old eustoms which 
the wisdom of his ancestors had consecrated, Pitt 
did not dare to use his power for proeuring its 
abclition, but left to his successors the glory 
of destroying. that infamous trade, on the pres- 
ervation of which his royal master had set his 
heart... Beeause, George III detested the French

  inhabitants of Kamehatka or of Tibet, Pitt, con- 
trary to his own judgment, engaged in a war. 
with France by which England was seriously im-" 
periled, and the English people burdened with 
a debt that their remotest posterity. will be un- 
able to pay. But, notwithstanding all this, when 
Pitt, only a few years before his death, showed 
a determination to concede to the Irish some’ ° 
small share of their undoubted rights, the King 
dismissed him from office; and the King’s friends, 
as they were called, exprest their indignation 
at the presumption of a minister who could 
oppose the wishes of so benign and gracious a 
master. And when, unhappily for his own fame, 
this great man determined to return to power, 
he could only recover office by conceding that 
very point for which he had relinquished it; thus 
setting the mischievous example of the minister 
of a free country sacrificing his own judgment 
to the personal prejudices of the sovereign. ' 
As it was hardly possible to find other min- 
isters who to equal abilities would add equal 
subservience, it is not surprizing that the highest 
offices were constantly filled by men of notorious 
incapacity. Indeed, the King seemed to have 
an instinetive antipathy to everything great and 
noble. During the reign of George II the elder 
Pitt had won for himself a reputation which 
covered the world, and had earried to an un- 
precedented height the glories of the English — 
name. He, however, as the avowed friend of 
popular rights, strenuously opposed the despotic 
principles of the court; and for this reason he 
was hated by George III with a hatred that 
seemed barely compatible with a sane mind. :

THE MOTIVE FOR CULTURE’ - 
Tur disparagers of culture make its motive 
curiosity; sometimes, indeed, they make its mo- 
tive mere exclusiveness and vanity. The culture 
which is supposed to plume itself on a smattering 
of Greek and Latin is a culture which is begotten 
by nothing so intellectual as curiosity ; it.is valued 
either out of sheer vanity and ignorance or else 
as an engine of social and class distinetion, sep- 
arating its holder, like a badge or title, from 
other people who have not got it. No serious 
man would call this culture, or attach any value 
to it as culture at all., To find the real ground 
for the very different estimate which serious 
people will set upon culture we must find some 
motive for culture in the terms of which may 
lie a, real ambiguity; and such a motive the word 
curiosity gives us. . 
I have before now pointed out that we English 
do ‘not, like. the foreigners, use this word in a 
good sense as well as in a bad sense. With us 
1From “Culture and Anarchy.” 
208

  MATTHEW ARNOLD 
  the word is always used in. a somewhat dis- 
approving sense... A liberal and intelligent eager- 
ness about the things of the mind-may be meant 
by a foreigner when he speaks of curiosity, but. 
with us the word always conveys a certain notion.’ 
of frivolous and unedifying activity. In the 
Quarterly Review, some little time ago,’ was an 
estimate of the celebrated French critic, M. 
Sainte-Beuve, and a.very inadequate estimate of 
it in my judgment it was. And its inadequacy 
consisted chiefly in this: that in oar English way 
it left out of sight the double sense really in- 
volved in the word curiosity, thinking enough 
was said to stamp M. Sainte-Beuve with blame, 
if it was said that he was impelled in his opera- 
tions as a critic by curiosity, and omitting either to 
perceive that M. Sainte-Beuve himself, and many _ 
other people with him, would consider that this was 
praiseworthy and not blameworthy, or to point 
out why it ought really to be accounted worthy 
of blame and not of praise. For as there is a 
curiosity about intellectual matters which is fu-. 
tile, and merely a disease, so. there is certainly a 
euriosity—a desire after the things of the mind 
simply for their own sakes and for the pleasure 
of seeing them as they are—which is, in an intel- 
ligent being, natural and laudable. 
Nay, and the very desire to see things as they 
are implies a balance and regulation of mind 
which is not often attained without fruitful ef- 
fort, and which is the very opposite of the blind 
and diseased impulse of mind which is what we 
mean to blame when we blame curiosity. Mon- 
tesquieu says: ‘‘The first motive which ought to 
impel us to study is the desire to augment: the 
VI—-14 209
-P-A-G-E-221
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD'S CLASSICS 
  excellence of our nature, and to render an intel- 
ligent being yet more intelligent.’’ This is the 
true ground to assign for the genuine scientific 
passion, however manifested, and for culture, 
viewed simply as a fruit of this passion; and it 
is a worthy ground, even tho we let the term 
euriosity stand to describe it. 
But there is of culture another view, in which 
not solely the scientifie passion, the sheer desire 
to see things as they are, natural and proper in 
an intelligent being, appears as the ground of it. 
There is.a view in which all the love of our 
neighbor, the impulses toward action, help, and 
' beneficerice, the desire for removing human error, 
clearing human confusion, and diminishing hu- 
man misery, the noble aspiration to leave the 
world better and happier than we found it— 
motives eminently such as are called social— 
come in as part of the grounds of culture, and 
the main and preeminent part. Culture is then 
properly described not as having its origin in 
euriosity, but as having its origin in the love of 
perfection; it is a study of perfection. It moves 
by the force, not merely or primarily of the 
seientifie passion for pure knowledge, but also 
of the moral and social passion for doing good. 
As, in the first view of it, we took for its worthy 
motto’ Montesquieu’s words: ‘‘To render an in- 
telligent being yet more intelligent!’’ so, in the 
second view of it, there is no better motto which 
it can have than these words of Bishop Wilson: 
‘¢‘To make reason and the will of God pre- 
vail’? oe 
The pursuit of perfection, then, is the pursuit 
of ‘sweetness and light. He who works for sweet- 
210
-P-A-G-E-222
  MATTHEW ARNOLD 
  ness and light works to make reason and the will 
of God prevail. He.who works for machinery, 
he who works for hatred, works only for con-. 
fusion. Culture looks beyoud machinery, culture: ° 
hates hatred, culture has one great. passion, thé, ° 
passion for sweetness and light. It has one even: 
yet greater!—the passion for making them pre- 
vail. It is not satisfied till we all come to a 
perfect man; it knows that the sweetness and 
light of the few must be imperfect until the raw 
and unkindied masses of humanity are touched 
with sweetness and light. If I have not shrunk 
from saying that we must work for sweetness and 
light, so neither have I shrunk from saying that 
we must have a broad basis, must have sweetness 
and light for as many as possible. Again and 
again I have insisted how those are the happy 
moments of humanity, how those are the marking . 
epochs of a people’s life, how those are the 
flowering times for literature and art and all 
the creative power of genius, when there is a 
national glow of life and thought, when the whole 
of society is in the fullest measure permeated 
by thought, sensible to beauty, intelligent and 
alive. Only it must be real thought and real 
beauty; real sweetness and real light. Plenty 
of people will try to give the masses, as they. 
eall them, an intellectual food prepared and 
adapted in the way they think proper for the 
actual condition of the masses. The ordinary 
popular literature is an example of this way. 
of working on the masses. Plenty of people will 
try to indoctrinate the masses with the set of 
ideas and judgments constituting the ereed of - 
their own profession or party. 
211
-P-A-G-E-223
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD'S CLASSICS 
  Our religious and political organizations give 
an example of this way of working on the masses. 
I condemn neither way; but cultare works dif- 
ferently. It does not try to teach down to the 
level .of inferior classes; it does not try to win 
them for this or that sect of its own, with ready- 
made judgments and watchwords. It seeks to do 
away with classes; to make the best that has 
been thought and known in the world eurrent 
everywhere; to make all men live in an atmos- 
phere: of sweetness and light, where they may 
. use ideas, as it uses them itself, freely—nour- 
ished, and not bound by them. This is the social 
idea; and the men of culture are the true apostles 
of equality. The great men of eulture are those 
who have had a passion for diffusing, for making 
prevail, for. carrying from one end of society 
to the other, the best knowledge, the best ideas 
of: their time, who have labored to divest knowl- 
edge of all that was harsh, uncouth, difficult, 
abstract, professional, exclusive; to humanize it; 
to make it efficient outside the clique of the 
cultivated and learned, yet still remaining the 
best knowledge and thought of the time, and a 
true source, therefore, of sweetness and light. 
Such a man was Abélard in the Middle Ages, 
in spite of all his imperfections; and thence the 
boundless emotion and enthusiasm whieh Abélard 
excited. Such were Lessing and Herder in Ger- 
many, at the end of the last century; and their 
services to Germany were.in this way inestimably 
precious. Generations will pass, and literary 
monuments will accumulate; and works far more 
perfect than the works of Lessing and Herder 
will be produced in Germany; and yet the names 
212
-P-A-G-E-224
  MATTHEW ARNOLD 
  of these two men will fill a German with a 
reverence and enthusiasm such as the names of 
the most gifted masters will hardly awaken... . 
And why? Because they humanized knowl. 
  edge; because they broadened’ the basis of life’ 
and intelligence; because they worked powerfully 
to diffuse the sweetness and light, to. make reason 
and the will of God prevail. With Saint Augus- 
tine they said: ‘‘Let us not leave thee alone 
to make in‘the secret of thy knowledge, as thou 
didst before the creation of the. firmament, the 
division of light from darkness; let the children 
of thy spirit, placed in their firmament, make 
their light shine upon the earth, mark the- divi- 
sion of night and day, and announce the revolu- 
tion of the times; for the old order is passed, 
and the new arises; the night is spent, the day 
is come forth; and thou shalt crown the year 
with thy blessing, when thou shalt send forth 
laborers into thy harvest sown by other hands 
than theirs; when thou shalt send forth new. 
laborers to new seedtimes, whereof the harvest 
shall be not yet.’’

THE DEATH OF WILLIAM THE 
CONQUEROR’ 
Tre death-bed of William was a death-bed of 
all formal devotion, a death-bed of penitence 
whieh we may trust was more than formal. The 
English Chronicles,* after weighing the good and 
evil in him, sends him out of the world with a 
charitable prayer for his soul’s rest; and his 
repentance, late and fearful as it was, at once 
marks the distinction between the conqueror on 
his bed of death and his successor eut off without 
a thought of penitence in the midst of his crimes. 
He made his will. The mammon of unrighteous- 
ness which he had gathered together amid the 
groans and tears of England he now strove so 
to dispose of as to pave his way to an everlasting 
habitation. All his treasures were distributed 
. among the poor and the churches of his domin-

  ions. A special sum was set apart for ‘the re- 
building of the churches which had been. burned 
at Mantes, and gifts in money and books and 
ornaments of every kind were to be distributed 
among all the churches of England according ‘to: 
their rank. He then spoke of his ‘own life and 
of the arrangements which he wished to make 
for his dominions after his death. The Normans, 
he said, were a brave and unconquered race; 
but they needed the curb of a strong and right- 
eous master to keep them in the path of order. 
Yet the rule over them must by all law pass to 
Robert. Robert was his eldest born; he had 
promised him the Norman succession before he 
won the crown of England, and he had. received 
the homage of the barons of the Duchy. Nor- 
mandy and Maine must therefore pass to Robert, 
and for them he must be the man of the French 
king. Yet he well knew how sad would be the 
fate of the land which had to be ruled by one 
so proud and foolish, and for whom a career of 
shame and sorrow was surely doomed. . 
But what was to be done with England? Now 
at last the heart of William smote him. To Eng- 
land he dared not appoint a successor; he could 
only leave the disposal of the island realm to the 
Almighty Ruler of the world. The evil deeds of 
his past life erowded upon his soul. Now at 
last his heart confest that he had won England 
by no right, by. no elaim of birth; that he had 
won the English crown by wrong, and that what - 
he had won by wrong he had no right to give 
to another. He had won his realm by warfare 
and bloodshed; he had treated the sons of the 
English soil with needless harshness; he had 
215
-P-A-G-E-227
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD'S CLASSICS 
  ernelly wronged nobles and commons; he had 
spoiled many men wrongfully of their inher- 
itance; he had slain countless multitudes by hun- 
ger or by the sword. The harrying of Northum- 
berland now rose up before his eyes in all its 
blackness. The dying man now told how ernelly 
he had burned and plundered the land, what 
thousands of every age and sex among the noble 
nation which he. had conquered had been done 
to-death at his bidding. The scepter.of the realm 
which he had won by so many crimes he dared 
not hand over to any but to God alone. Yet he 
would not hide his wish that his son William, 
who had ever been dutiful to him, might reign 
in England after him. He would send him be- 
yond the sea, and he would pray Lafrane to 
place the crown upon his head, if the Primate 
in his wisdom deemed that such an act could 
be rightly done. 
Of. the: two sons of whom he spoke, Robert 
was: far away, a banished rebel; William was 
by his bedside. By his bedside also stood hig 
youngest son, the English Atheling, Henry the 
Clerk. ‘‘And what dost thou give to me, my 
father?’’ said the youth. ‘‘Five thousand pounds 
of silver from my hoard,’ was the Conqueror’s 
answer. ‘But of what use is a hoard to me if 
I have no place to dwell in?’’ ‘‘Be patient, 
my. son; and trust in the Lord, and let thine 
elders go before thee.’’ It is perhaps by the 
_ light of the later events that our chronicler goes 
on to make William tell his youngest son that 
the day would come when he would sneceed both his brothers in their dominions, and would be richer and mightier than either of them. The King

  then dictated a letter to Lafranc, setting forth his 
wishes with regard to the kingdom. He sealed 
it and gave it to his son William, and bade him, 
with his last blessing and his last kiss, to cross 
at onee into England. William Rufus: straight- 
way set forth for Witsand, and there heard of 
his father’s death. Meanwhile Henry, too, left 
his father’s bedside to take for himself the money 
that was left to him, to see that nothing was 
lacking in its weight, to call together his com- 
rades on whom he could trust, and to take meas- 
ures for stowing the treasure ina place of safety. 
And now those who stood around the dying 
King began to implore his merey for the eap- 
tives whom he held in prison. He granted the 
prayer. . . 
The last earthly acts. of the Conqueror were 
now done. He had striven to make his peace 
with God and man, and to make such provision. 
as he eould for the children and the subjects 
whom he had left behind him. And now his last 
hour was come. On a Thursday morning in 
September, when the sun had already risen upon 
the earth, the sound of the great bell of the 
metropolitan minster struck on the ears of the 
dying King. He asked why it sounded. He was 
told that it rang for prime in the church of our 
Lady. William lifted his eyes to heaven, he 
stretched forth his hands, and spake his last 
words: ‘‘To my Lady Mary, the Holy Mother of 
God, I commend myself, that by her holy prayers 
she may reconcile me to her dear Son, our Lord 
Jesus Christ.’? He prayed, and his soul passed 
away. William, king of the-English and duke 
of the Normans, the man whose fame has filled

the world in his own and in every following age, 
had gone the way of all flesh. No kingdom was 
left him now but his seven feet of ground, and 
even to that his claim was not to be undisputed. 
The death of a king in those days came near 
to a break-up of all eivil society. Till a new 
king was chosen and crowned, there was no 
longer a power in the land to protect or to chas- 
tise, All bonds were loosed; all public authority 
was'in abeyance;.each man had to look to his 
own.as he best might. No sooner was the breath 
out of William’s body than the great company 
which had patiently watched around him during 
the night was scattered hither and.thither. The 
great men mounted their horses and rode with 
all speed to their own homes, to guard their 
houses and goods against the outburst of law- 
lessness which was sure to break forth now that 
the land had no longer:a ruler. Their servants 
and followers, seeing their lords gone, and deem- 
ing that there was no longer any fear of punish- 
ment, began to make spoil of the royal chamber. 
‘Weapons, clothes, vessels, thie royal bed and its 
furniture, were earried off, and for a whole day 
the body of the Conqueror lay well-nigh bare on 
the floor of the room in which he died.

ON A PIECE OF CHALK’ 
A ereat chapter of the history of the world 
is written in the chalk. Few passages in the 
history of man can be supported by such ‘an 
overwhelming mass of direct and indirect evi- 
dence as that which testifies to the truth of the 
fragment of the history of the globe which I 
hope to enable you to read with your own eyes 
to-night. Let me add that few chapters of human 
history have a moxg profound significance for 
ourselves. I weigh my words well when I assert 
that the man who should know the true history

about in his breeches pocket, tho ignorant of all 
other history, is likely, if he will think his knowl-

  edge out to its ultimate results, to have a truer 
and therefore a better conception of this wonder- 
ful universe, and of man’s relation to it, than the 
most learned student: who is deep-read in the 
records of humanity and ignorant of those of 
Nature. 
” The language of the chalk is not hard to learn; 
not nearly so hard as Latin, if you only want to 
get at the broad features of the story if has to 
tell:.and I propose that we now set to work to 
spell that story out together. 
‘We all know that if we ‘‘burn”’ chalk, the 
result is quicklime. Chalk in fact is a compound 
of carbonic-acid gas and lime; and when you 
make it very hot, the carbonie acid flies away 
and the lime is left. By this method of pro- 
eedure we see the lime, but we do not see the 
carbonic acid. If on the other hand you were 
to powder a little chalk and drop it into a good 
deal of strong vinegar, there would be a great 
bubbling and fizzing, and finally a clear liquid 
in which no sign of chalk would appear. Here 
you see the carbonie acid in the bubbles; the 
lime dissolved in the vinegar vanishes from sight. 
There are a great many other ways of showing 
that chalk is essentially nothing but carbonic 
‘acid and quicklime. Chemists enunciate the re- 
sult of all the experiments which prove this, by 
stating that chalk is almost wholly composed of 
“carbonate of lime.’’ 
It is desirable for us to start from the knowl- 
edge of this fact, tho it may not seem to help 
us very far’ toward what we seek. For earbonate 
of lime is a widely spread’ substance, and is 
met with under very various conditions. All sorts 
220 -
-P-A-G-E-232
  THOMAS HENRY HUXLEY 
  of limestones are composed of more or less pure 
carbonate of lime. The crust which is often de- 
posited by waters which have drained through 
limestone. rocks, in the form of what are called 
stalagmites and stalactites, is carbonate of lime. 
Or to take a more familiar example, the fur on - 
the inside of a tea-kettle is carbonate of lime; 
and for anything chemistry tells us to the con- 
trary, the chalk might be a kind of gigantic fur 
upon the bottom of the earth-kettle, which is 
kept pretty hot below. : 
But the slice of chalk presents a totally dif- 
ferent appearance when placed under the miero- 
scope. The general mass of it is made up of 
very minute granules; but imbedded in this mat- 
rix are innumerable bodies, some smaller and 
some larger, but on a rough average not more 
than a hundreth of an inch in diameter, having 
a well-defined shape and structure. A cubic ineh 
of some specimens of chalk may contain hundreds 
of thousands of these bodies, compacted together 
with incaleulable millions of granules. 
The examination of a transparent slice gives 
a good notion of the manner in which the com- 
ponents of the chalk are arranged, and of their 
relative proportion. But by rubbing up some 
ehalk with a brush in water and then pouring 
off the milky fluid, so as to obtain sediments of 
different degrees of fineness, the granules and 
the minute rounded bodies may be pretty well 
separated from one another, and submitted to 
microscopie examination, either as opaque or-as 
transparent objects. _By combining the views 
obtained in these various methods, eaeh of tha 
rounded bedies may be proved to be a beautifully

construeted calcareous fabric, made up of a 
number of chambers communicating freely with 
one another. The chambered bodies are of va- 
rious forms. One of the commonest is something 
like a badly grown raspberry, being formed of 
a number of nearly globular chambers of different 
sizes congregated together. It is called Globi- 
ina, and some specimens of chalk consist of 
little else than. Globigerinw and granules. Let 
us fix our attention upon the Globigerina. It is 
the spore of the game we are tracking. If we 
ean learn what it is and what are the conditions 
of its existence, we shall see our way to the origin 
and past. history of the chalk. . . . 
The history of the diseovery of these living 
Globigerinew, and of the part which they play 
in rock-building, is singular’ enough. It is a 
discovery which, like others of no less scientific 
importance, has arisen incidentally out of work 
devoted to. very different and exceedingly prac- 
. tical interests. When men first took to the sea, 
they speedily learned to look out for the shoals 
and rocks; and the more the burden of their 
ships inereased, the more imperatively necessary 
it became for sailors to ascertain with precision 
the. depth of the waters they traversed. Out of 
this necessity grew the use of the lead and 
sounding-line; and ultimately marine surveying, 
which is the recording of the form of coasts and 
of the depth of the sea, as ascertained by the 
sounding-lead, upon charts. 
At the same time it became desirable to as- 
certain .and to indicate the nature of the sea 
bottom, since this cireumstanee greatly affects 
its goodness as holding-ground for anchors. Some

  ingenious. tar, whose name deserves a better fate 
than the oblivion into which it has fallen, attained 
this object by ‘‘arming’’ the bottom of the lead 
with a lump of grease, to which more or less. of 
the sand or mud or broken shells, as the ease 
might be, adhered, and was brought to the sur- 
face. But however well adapted such an ap- 
paratus might be for rough nautical purposes, 
scientific aceuracy could not be expected from 
the armed lead; and to remedy its defects (espe- 
cially when applied to sounding in great depths), 
Lieutenant Brooke of the American Navy some 
years ago invented a most ingenious machine, 
by which a considerable portion of the superficial 
layer of the sea bottom can be scooped out and 
brought up from any depth to which the lead 
deseends. In 1853 Lieutenant Brooke obtained 
mud from the bottom of the North Atlantic, 
between Newfoundland and the Azores, at a 
depth of more than 10,000 feet or two miles, 
by the help of this sounding apparatus. The 
specimens were sent for examination to Ehren- 
berg of Berlin and to Bailey of West Point; and 
those able microscopists found that this deep- 
sea mud was almost entirely composed of the 
skeletons of living organisms—the greater pro- 
portion of these being just like the Globigerine 
already known to occur in the chalk. 
Thus far the work had been carried on simply. 
in the interests of science; but Lieutenant 
Brooke’s method of sounding acquired a high 
commercial value when the enterprise of laying 
down the telegraph cable between this country 
and the United States was undertaken. For it 
became a matter of immense importance to know 
223

  not only the depth of the sea over the whole 
line along which the cable was to be laid, but 
the exact -nature of the bottom, so as to guard 
against chances of eutting or fraying the strands 
of that costly rope. The Admiralty consequently 
ordered Captain Dayman, an old friend and ship- 
mate of mine, to ascertain the depth over the 
whole line of the cable and to bring back speci- 
mens of the bottom... In former days, such a 
command .as ‘this might have sounded very much 
like one of the impossible things which the young 
prince in the fairy tales is ordered to do before 
he can obtain the hand of the princess. How- 
ever, in the months of June and July, 1857, my 
friend performed the task assigned to him with 
great expedition and precision, without, so far 
as I’ know, having met with any reward of that 
' kind. The specimens of Atlantie mud which 
he procured were’ sent to me to.be examined and 
reported upon. 
The results of all these operations is, that we 
know the contours and the nature of the surface 
soil covered by the North Atlantic for a distance 
of 1,700 miles from east to west, as well as we 
know that of any part of the dry land. It is 
a prodigious plain—one of the widest and most 
even plains in the world. If the sea were drained 
off, you might drive-a wagon all the way. from 
Valentia on the west coast of Ireland, to Trinity 
Bay. in Newfoundland; and except upon one 
sharp incline about 200 miles from Valentia, I 
am nof quite sure that it would even be necessary 
to. put the skid on, so gentle are the ascents and 
descents upon that long route. From Valentia 
. the-road would lie downhill for about 200 miles, 
224
-P-A-G-E-236

  to the point.at which the bottom is now covered 
by 1,700 fathoms of sea-water. Then would come 
the central plain, more than a thousand miles 
wide, the inequalities of the surface of which 
would-be hardly perceptible, tho the depth of 
water upon it now varies from 10,000 to 15,000 
feet; and there are places in which Mont Blane 
might be sunk without showing its peak above 
water, Beyond this the ascent on the American 
side commences, and gradually leads for about 
300 miles to the Newfoundland shore. 
Almost the whole of the bottom of this central 
plain (which extends for’ many hundred miles 
in a north-and-south direction) is covered by. 
a fine mud, which when brought to the surface 
dries into a grayish-white friable substance. You 
ean write with this on a blackboard if you are 
so inclined; and to the eye it is quite like very 
soft, grayish chalk. Examined chemically, it 
proves to be composed almost wholly of carbonate 
of lime; and if you make a section of it, in the 
same way as that of the piece of chalk was made, 
and view it with the microscope, it presents in- 
numerable Globigerins imbedded ina granular 
matrix. Thus this deep-sea mud is substantially 
chalk. I say substantially, because there are 
a good many minor differences; but as these have 
no bearing on the question immediately before 
us—which is the nature of the Globigering of 
the ehalk—it is unnecessary to speak of them. 
Globigerinw of every size, from the smallest 
to the largest, are associated together in the 
Atlantic mud,: and the chambers of many are 
filled by a soft animal matter. This soft sub- 
stance is, in fact, the remains of the ereature 
VI—15 225
-P-A-G-E-237
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD'S CLASSICS 
  to which the Globigerina shell, or rather skeleton, 
owes its existence, and which is an animal of the 
simplest imaginable description. It is, in fact, 
a mere particle of living jelly, without defined 
parts of any kind; without. a mouth, nerves, 
muscles, or distinct organs, and only manifesting 
its vitality to ordinary observation by thrusting 
out and retracting from all parts of its surface 
long. filamentous processes, which serve for arms 
and legs. Yet this amorphous particle, devoid 
of everything which in the higher animals we 
eall organs, is capable of feeding, growing, and 
taultiplying; of separating from the ocean the 
small proportion of carbonate of lime which is 
dissolved in sea-water; and of building up that 
substance into a skeleton for itself, according 
to a pattern whieh can be. imitated by no other 
known agency. 
The notion that animals can live and flourish 
in the sea, at the vast depths from which ap- 
parently living Globigerine have been brought 
up, does not agree very well with our usual con- 
ceptions respecting the conditions of animal life; 
and it is not so absolutely impossible as it might 
at. first sight appear to be, that the Globigerinze 
of the Atlantic sea bottom do not live and die 
where they are found. 
As I have mentioned, the soundings from the 
great Atlantie plain are almost entirely made 
up of Globigerinz, with the granules which have 
been mentioned, and some few other calcareous 
shells; but a small percentage of the chalky mud 
-—perhaps at. most some five per cent. of it—is of 
a. different nature, and consists of shells and skel- 
etons composed of silex or pure flint. These 
226
-P-A-G-E-238
  THOMAS HENRY HUXLEY 
  
siliceous bodies belong partly to the lowly veg- 
etable organisms: which are called Diatomacen, 
and partly to the minute and extremely simple 
animals termed Radiolaria. It is quite certain 
that these creatures do not live at the bottom 
of the ocean, but at its surface, where they may 
be obtained in prodigious numbers by the use 
of a properly constructed net. Hence it follows 
that these siliceous organisms, tho they are not 
heavier than the lightest dust, must have fallen 
in some eases through 15,000 feet of water before 
they reached their final resting-place’ on the 
ocean floor. And considering how large a surface 
these bodies expose in proportion to their weight, 
it is probable that they oceupy a great length 
of time in making their burial journey from the 
surface of the Atlantic to the bottom. . . - 
Thus not only is it certain that the chalk is - 
the mud of an ancient sea bottom, but it is no 
less certain that the chalk sea existed during an 
extremely long period, tho we may not be pre- 
pared to give a precise estimate of the length of 
that period in years. The relative duration is 
clear, tho the absolute duration may not be de- 
finable. The attempt to affix any precise date 
to the period at which the chalk sea began or 
ended its existence is baffled by difficulties of the 
same kind. But the relative age of the cretaceous 
epoch may be determined with as great ease and 
certainty as the long duration of that epoch. 
You will have heard of the interesting dis- 
eoveries recently made in various parts of west- 
ern Europe, of flint implements, obviously workec 
into shape by human hands, under cireumstances 
which show conclusively that man is a very an-

    cient denizen of these regions. It has been proved 
that the whole population of Europe whose ex- 
istence has been revealed to us in this way, con- 
sisted. of savages such as the Eskimo are now; 
that in the country which is now France they 
hunted the reindeer, and were familiar with the 
ways of the mammoth and the bison. The phys- 
ieal geography of France was in those days 
different from what it is now,—the river Somme, 
for instance, having cut its bed a hundred feet 
deeper between that time and this; and it is 
probable that the climate was more like that of 
Canada or Siberia than that of western Europe. 
The existence of these people is forgotten even 
in the traditions of the oldest historical nations. 
The name and fame of them had utterly vanished 
until a few years back; and the amount of phys- 
ical ehange which has been effected since their 
day renders it more than probable that, venerable 
as are some of the historical nations, the. workers 
of the chipped flints of Hoxne or of Amiens are 
to them as they are to us in point of antiquity. 
But: if’ we assign to these hoar relies of long- 
vanished generations of men the greatest age that 
ean possibly be claimed for them, they are not 
older than ‘the drift of boulder clay, which in 
comparison with the chalk is but a very juvenile 
deposit. You need go no further than your own 
seaboard for evidence of this fact. At one of 
the most charming spots on the coast of Norfolk, 
Cromer, you will see the boulder clay forming a 
vast. mass, which lies upon the chalk, and must 
eonsequently have come into existence after it. 
Hage boulders of chalk are in fact included in the clay, and have evidently been brought to the 
228
-P-A-G-E-240

  position they now occupy by the same agency as 
that which has planted blocks of syenite from 
Norway side by side with them. . . 
Thus there is a writing upon the wall of cliffs 
at Cromer, and whoso runs may read it. It tells 
us with-an authority which can not be impeached, 
that the ancient sea-bed of the chalk sea was 
raised up and remained dry land until it was 
covered with forest, stocked with the great game 
the spoils of which have rejoiced your geologists. 
How long it remained in that condition can not 
be said; but ‘‘the whirligig of time brought its 
revenges’’ in those days as in these. That dry 
land with the bones and teeth of generations of 
long-lived elephants, hidden away among the 
gnarled roots and dry leaves of its ancient trees, 
sank gradually to the bottom of the icy sea, which 
covered it with huge masses of drift and boulder 
clay. Sea beasts such as the walrus, now -re- 
stricted to the extreme north, paddled about 
where birds had twittered among the topmost 
twigs of the fir-trees. How long this state of 
things endured we know not, but at length it 
came to an end. The upheaved glacial mud 
hardened into the soil of modern Norfolk. For- 
ests grew once more, the wolf and the beaver 
replaced the reindeer and the elephant; and at 
length what we call the history of England: 
dawned.

THE GREAT BOOKS OF THE WORLD? 
I say it most confidently, the first intellectual 
task of our age is rightly to order and make 
serviceable the vast realm of printed material 
whieh four centuries have swept across our path. 
To organize our knowledge, to systematize our 
reading, to save, out of the relentless cataract of 
ink, the immortal thoughts of the greatest—this 
is a neeessity unless the productive ingenuity of 
man is to lead us at last to a measureless and 
pathless chaos. To know anything that turns up 
is, in the infinity of knowledge, to know nothing. 
To read the first. book we come across, in the 
wilderness of books, is to learn nothing. To turn 
over the pages of ten thousand volumes is to be 
practically indifferent to all that is good. . . .

  I am very far from meaning that our whole 
time spent with books is to be given to study. 
Far from it. I put the poetie and emotional side 
of literature as the most needed for daily use. 1 
take the books that seek to rouse the imagination, 
to stir up feeling, touch the heart; the books of 
art, of fancy, of ideals, such as reflect the delight 
and aroma of life. And here how does the trivial, 
provided it is the new, that which stares at us in 
the advertising columns of the day, erowd out the 
immortal poetry and pathos of the human race, 
vitiating our taste for those exquisite pieces which 
are a household word, and weakening our mental 
relish for the eternal works of genius! Old Homer 
is the very fountainhead of pure poetic enjoy- 
ment, of all that is spontaneous, simple, native, 
and dignified in life. He takes us into the am- 
brosial world of heroes, of human vigor, of purity, 
of grace. Now Homer is one of the few poets 
the life of whom can be fairly preserved in a 
translation. Most men and women ean say that 
they have read Homer, just as most of us can 
say that we have studied Johnson’s Dictionary. 
But how few of us take him up, time after time, 
with fresh delight! How few have even read the 
entire ‘‘Tliad’’ and ‘‘Odyssey’’ through! Whether 
in the resounding lines of the old Greek, as fresh 
and ever-stirring as the waves that tumble on the 
seashore, filling the soul with satisfying silent 
wonder at its restless unison; whether in the 
quaint lines of Chapman, or the clarion couplets 
of Pope, or the closer versions of Cowper, Lord 
Derby, of Philip Worsley, or even in the new 
prose version of the ‘‘Odyssey,’’ Homer is always 
fresh and rich. And yet how seldom does one

antiquity, whilst they wade through torrents of

tentedly as cattle in 4 fresh meadow, through the

tion which will listen to ‘‘Pinafore’’ for three

teenth romance, ean no.more read Homer than it 
eould read a cuneiform inscription. It-will read 
about Homer just as it will.read about a cunei- 
form: inscription, and will crowd to see a. few 
pots which probably came from the neighborhood 
of Troy. But to Homer and the primeval type of 
heroie man in his beauty, and his simpleness, and 
joyousness, the cultured generation is really dead, 
as completely as some spoiled beauty of the ball- 
room is dead to the bloom of the heather or the 
waving of the daffodils in a glade. 
it is a true psychological problem, this nausea 
which idle culture seems to produce for all that 
is-manly and pure in heroie poetry. One knows— 
at least every schoolboy has. known—that a pas- 
sage of Homer, rolling along in the hexameter or 
trumped out by Pope, will give one a hot glow 
of pleasure and raise a finer throb in the pulse; 
one knows that Homer is the easiest, most artless, 
most diverting of all poets; that the fiftieth read- 
ing rouses.'the spirit even more than the first-— 
and yet we find ourselves (we are all alike) pain- 
fully pshaw-ing over some new and uneut barley 
sugar in rime, which a man.in the street asked 
us if. we had read, or it may be some learned 
lueubration: about ‘the site of Troy by some one 
we chanced.to meet at dinner. It is an unwritten

  chapter in the history of the human mind, how 
this literary prurience after new print unmans us 
for the enjoyment of the old songs chanted forth 
in the sunrise of human imagination. To ask a 
man or woman who spends half a lifetime in suck- 
ing magazines and new poems to read a book of 
Homer would be like asking a butcher’s boy to 
whistle ‘‘Adelaida.’’ The noises and sights. and 
talk, the whirl and volatility of life around us, 
are too strong for us.. A society which is forever 
gossiping in a sort of perpetual ‘‘drum’’ loses 
the very faculty of earing for anything but 
“Searly copies’’ and the last tale out. Thus, like 
the tares in the: noble parable of the Sower,.a 
perpetual chatter about books chokes the seed 
which is sown in the greatest books in the world. 
I speak of Homer, but fifty other great poets 
and ereators of eternal beauty would serve my 
argument as well. Take the latest perhaps in the 
series of the world-wide and immortal poets of 
the whole human race—Walter Scott. We all read 
Seott’s romances, as we have all read Hume’s 
‘History of England,’’ but how often do we read 
them, how zealously, with what sympathy and 
understanding? I am told that the last discovery 
of modern. culture is that Scott’s prose is com- 
monplace; that the young men at our universities 
are far too eritical to eare for his artless sen- 
tences and flowing descriptions. They prefer Mr. 
Swinburne, Mr. Mallock, and the euphuism of 
young Oxford, just as some people prefer a Dres- 
den shepherdess to the Caryatides of the 
Erechtheum, pronounce Fielding to be low; and 
Mozart to be passé. As boys love lollipops, 80 
these juvenile fops love to roll phrases about 
233
-P-A-G-E-245
  “PHE BEST OF THE WORLD'S CLASSICS 
  - under the tongue, as if phrases in themselves had. 
a value apart from thoughts, feelings, great eon- 
ceptions, or human sympathy. 
For Seott is just one-of the poets: (we may call 
poets all the great ereators in prose or in verse) 
of whom one never wearies, just as one can listen 
to Beethoven or watch the sunrise or the sunset 
day by day with new delight. I think I can read 
the ‘‘Antiquary,’’ or the ‘‘Bride of Lammer- 
moor,’’? ‘‘Ivanhoe,’’ ‘‘Quentin Durward,’’? and 
“¢Qld ‘Mortality,’’ at least once a year afresh. 
Now Scott is a perfect library in himself. A con- 
stant reader of romances would find that it needed. 
months to go through even the best pieces of the 
inexhaustible painter of eight full centuries and 
every type of man, and he might repeat the pro- 
cess. of reading him ten times in a lifetime with- 
out a sense.of fatigue or sameness. 
‘The poetic beanty of Scott’s creations is almost 
the least of his great qualities. It is the uni- 
versality of his sympathy that is so truly great, 
the justice of his estimates, the insight into the 
spirit of each age, his intense absorption of self 
in the vast epic of human civilization. What are 
the old almanacs that they so often give us as 
histories beside these living pictures of the 
ordered succession of ages? As in Homer him- 
self, we see in this prose ‘‘Iliad’’ of modern his- 
tory the battle of the old a d the new, the heroic 
defense of ancient strongholds, the long impend- 
ing and inevitable doom of medieval life. Strong 
“ men and proud women struggle against the des- 
_ tiny of modern society, unconsciously working out 
its ways, undauntedly defying its power. How 
just is our island Homer! Neither Greek nor

  Trojan sways him; Achilles is his hero; Hector is 
his favorite; he loves the councils of chiefs and 
the palace of Priam; but the swineherd, the 
charioteer, the slave girl, the hound, the beggar, 
and the herdsman, all glow alike in the harmoni- 
ous coloring of his peopled epic. We see the dawn 
of our English nation, the defense of Christen- — 
dom against the Koran, the grace and the terror 
of feudalism, the rise of monarchy out of baron- 
ies, the rise of parliaments out of monarchy, the 
tise of industry out of serfage, the pathetic ruin 
of chivalry, the splendid death struggle of 
Catholicism, the sylvan tribes of the mountain 
(remnants of our prehistorie forefathers) beating 
themselves to pieces against the hard advance of 
modern industry; we see the grim heroism of the 
Bible martyrs, the catastrophe of feudalism over- 
whelmed by a practical age which knew little of 
its graces and almost nothing of its virtues. 
Such is Seott, who, we may say, has done for 
the various phases of modern history what 
Shakespeare has done for the manifold types of 
human character. And this glorious and most 
human and most historical of poets, without whom 
our very conception of human development would 
have ever been imperfect, this manliest and truest 
and widest of romancers we neglect for some hot- 
house hybrid of psychological analysis, for the 
wretched imitators of Balzac and the jackanapes 
phrasemongering of some Osrie of the day, who | 
assures us that Scott is an absolute Philistine. 
In speaking with enthusiasm of Seott, as of 
Homer, or of Shakespeare, or of Milton, or of any 
of the accepted masters of the world, I have no 
wish to insist dogmatically upon any single name,

ously injured nowadays by ihe habit we. get of 
singling out some particular quality, some par- 
ticular sehool.of art for intemperate praise or, 
still worse, for intemperate abuse. Mr. Ruskin,| 
I suppose, is answerable for the taste for this 
one-sided and spasmodic criticism; and every 
young gentleman who has the trick of a few ad- 
jectives will languidly vow that Marlowe is su- 
preme, or Murillo foul. It is the mark of rational 
criticism as well as of healthy thought to main- 
tain an-evenness of mind. in judging of great 
works, to recognize great qualities in due propor- 
tion, te feel that defects are made up by beauties, 
and beauties are often balaneed by weakness. The 
true judgment implies a weighing of each work 
and: each workman as a-whole, in relation to the 
sum of human -eultivation and the gradual ad- 
vanee of the movement ‘of ages. And in this mat- 
ter we shall usually find that the world is right, 
the world of the modern centuries and the nations 
of Europe together. It is unlikely,-to say the 
least of it, that a young person who has hardly 
ceased making. Latin verses. will be able to re- 
verse the decisions of the civilized world; and it 
is even more unlikely that Milton and Moliére, 
Fielding and Seott, will ever be displaced by a

is a liberal education in itself, I am asking for no 
exclusive devotion to Seoti, to any poet, or any 
school of poets, or any age, or any country, to 
any style or any order of poet, one more than’ an- 
other. They are as various, fortunately, and:as 
many-sided as human nature itself. If I delight

Sterne, and Goldsmith, and Defoe. Yes, and’ I 
will add Cooper and Marryat, Miss Edgeworth 
and Miss Austen—to confine myself to those who 
are already classics, to our own country, and to 
one form of art alone, and not to venture on the 
ground of contemporary romance in general. 
What I have said of Homer, I would say in a

  cients who are the most accessible to us in Eng- 
lish —-Ausechylus, Aristophanes, Virgil, and 
Horace. What I have said of Shakespeare I would 
say of Calderon, of Moliére, of Corneille, of 
Racine, of Voltaire, of Alfieri, of Goethe, of those 
dramatists, in many forms, and with genius the 
most diverse, who have so. steadily set themselves 
to idealize the great types of publie life and of 
the phases of human history. Let us all beware 
lest worship of the idiosynerasy of our peerless 
Shakespeare blind us to the value of the great 
masters who in a different world and with differ- 
ent aims have presented the development of eivili- 
zation in a series of dramas, where the unity of 
a few great types of man and of society is made 
paramount to subtlety of character or brilliancy 
of language.

GEORGE WASHINGTON* 
CHATHAM’S measure was contemptuously re- 
jected by the lords, as was a similar measure of 
Burke’s by the house of commons, and a petition 
of the city of London in favor of the eolonies by 
the king himself. -With the rejection of these 
efforts for conciliation began the great struggle 
which ended ‘eight years later in the severance of 
the American eclonies from the British crown. 
The congress of delegates from the colonial legis- 
latures at once. voted measures for general de- 
fense, ordered the levy of an army, and set George 
Washington at its head. No nobler figure ever 
’ stood in the forefront of a nation’s life. Wash- 
ington’ was grave and courteous in address; his 
Manners were simple and unpretending; his 
silence ‘and’ the serene calmness of his temper 
spoke of a perfect self-mastery. But there was 
little in, his outer bearing to reveal the grandeur 
of soul which. lifts his figure, with all the simple 
majesty of an ancient statue, out of the smaller

  passions, the meaner impulses of the world astound 
him. What recommended him for command: was 
simply his weight among his fellow-land-owners - 
of Virginia, and the experience of war which he 
had gained by s2rvice in border contests with the | 
French and the Indians, as well as in Braddock’ 8 
luckless expedition against Fort Duquesne.’ : 
It was only as (se weary fight went on that the 
eolonists discovered, however slowly and imper- 
fectly, the greatness of their leader; his clear 
judgment, his heroic endurance, his silence under. 
difficulties, his calmness in the hour of danger 
or defeat; the patience with which he waited, the. 
quickness and hardness with which he struck, the - 
lofty and serene sense of duty that never swerved || 
from its task through resentment or jealousy; that. 
never, through war or peace, felt the touch of a 
meaner ambition; that knew no aim save that of 
guarding the freedom of his fellow-countrymen, 
and no personal longing save that of returning 
to his own fireside when their freedom was se- 
eured. It was almost unconsciously that men - 
learned to cling to Washington with a trust and 
. faith such as few other men have won, and. to 
regard him with a reverence which still hushes 
us in presence of his memory. But even America 
hardly recognized his real greatness while he ' 
lived. It was only when death set its seal on him, 
that the voice of those whom he had served so 
long proclaimed him ‘‘the man first in war, first 
in peace, and first in the hearts of “his fellow- 
countrymen.’?

VOLTAIRE AS AN AUTHOR AND AS 
: A MAN OF ACTION* 
Tus man of letters, usually unable to conceive 
loftier' services to mankind or more attractive 
aims ‘to persons of capacity than the composition 
of books, has treated these pretensions of Vol- 
taire with a supercilious kind of censure, which 
teaches ug nothing about Voltair-, while it implies 
a particularly shallow idea alike of the position 
of the mere literary life in the scale of things, 
and of the conditions under which the best liter- 
‘work is done. To have really contributed in 
the humblest degree, for instance, to a peace be- 
tween Prussia and her enemies in 1759, would 
have. been. an immeasurably greater performance 
for mankind than any given book which Voltaire 
could have written. And, what is still better 
worth observing, Voltaire’s books would not have 
been the powers they were, but for this constant 
desire’ of his to come into the closest. contact with 
the practical affairs of the world. He who has 
never left the life of a recluse, drawing an in-

come from the funds and living in @ remote 
garden, constructing past, present, and future,‘out - 
of his own consciousness, is not qualified either to 
lead mankind safely, or to think on the course’. 
of human affairs correctly. Every page of Vol- 
taire has the bracing air of the life of the world 
in it, and the instinct which led him to seek the 
society of the conspicuous actors on the great 
seene was essentiall:, a right one. 
- The book-writer takes good advantage of his 
opportunity to assure men expressly or by im- 
plication that he is their true king, and that the 
sacred bard is a mightier man than his hero. 
Voltaire knew better. Tho himself perhaps the 
most puissant man of letters that ever lived, he 
rated literature as it ought to be rated below ac- 
tion, not because written speech is less of a foree, 
but because the speculation and criticism of the 
literature that substantially influences the world, 
make far less demand than the actual conduct of. 
great affairs on qualities which are not rare. in 
detail, but are amazingly rare in combination, — 
on temper, foresight, solidity, daring,—on 
strength, in a word, strength of intelligence and 
strength of character. Gibbon rightly amended 
his phrase, when he described Boethius not as 
stooping, but rather as: rising, from his life of 
placid meditation to an active share in the im- 
perial business. That he held this sound opinion 
is quite as plausible an explanation of Voltaire’s 
anxiety to know persons of station and im- 
portance, as the current theory that he was of 
sycophantie nature. ‘‘Why,’’ he asks, ‘tare the 
ancient historians so fuil of light? It is. because 
the writer had to do with public business; it is

  ‘' because he could be magistrate, priest, soldier ; 
and because. if he could not rise to the highest 
funetions of the. state, he had at least to make 
himself :worthy of them. I admit,’’? he con- 
cludes, ‘‘that we must not expect such an ad- 
vantage with us, for our own constitution hap- 
pens to be against it;’’ but he was deeply sensible 
what an advantage it was that they thus lost. 
In short, on all sides, whatever men_do and 
think was rea] ‘and alive to Voltaire. Whatever 
had the. quality of interesting any imaginable 
temperament, had the quality of interesting him. 
There was.no subject which any set of men have 
ever eared about, which, if he once had mention 
of it, Voltaire did not care about likewise. And 
it: wag just. becaise he was so thoroughly alive 
himself, that he filled the whole era with life. 
The more closely one studies the various move- 
ments of that time, the more clear it becomes that, 
* if he was not the original center and first foun- 
tain of them all, at any rate he made many chan- 
nels ready and gave the sign. He was the initial 
“principle of. fermentation throughout that vast 
commotion. We may deplore, if we think fit, as 
Erasmus deplored in the case of Luther, that the 
great change was not allowed. to work itself out 
slowly, calmly, and without violence and disrup- 
tion, ‘These graceful regrets.are powerless, and 
on the whole they are very enervating. Let us 
make our’ account with the actual, rather than 
seek exeuses for self-indulgence in pensive pref- 
erence of something that might have been. Prac- 
tically in these great cireles of affairs, what only 
‘might have been is as tho it could not be; and to 
know this may well. suffice for us.

FRANCIS VILLON’S TERRORS* 
No sooner had the theft been accomplished than. 
Villon shook himself, jumped to his feet, and be- 
gan helping tc seatter and extinguish the embers. 
Meanwhile Montigny opened the door and cau- 
tiously peered into the street. The coast was 
elear; there was no meddlesome patrol in sight. 
Still it was judged wiser to slip ‘out severally; 
and as Villon was himself in a hurry to escape 
from the neighborhood of the dead Thevenin, and 
the rest were in a still greater hurry to get rid . 
of him before he should diseover the loss of his — 
money, he was the first by general consent to 
issue forth into the street. 
The wind had triumphed and swept all the 
elouds from heaven. Only a few vapors, as thin 
as moonlight, fleeted rapidly across the stars. 
Tt was bitter cold; and by a common optical effect,

  things. seemed almost more definite than in the 
broadest daylight. The sleeping city ‘was ab- 
solutely still; 2 company of white hoods, a field 
full of: little Alps,: below the twinkling stars. 
Villon cursed his fortune, Would it were still 
snowing! Now, wherever he went, he left an in- 
delible trail behind him on the glittering streets; 
wherever .he ‘went he was still tethered to the 
house by the cemetery of St. John; wherever he 
went he must weave, with’ his own plodding feet, 
the:rope that bound him to the crime and would 
bind him to the gallows. The leer of the dead 
man ‘came back to him with a new significance. 
He snapt his fingers as if to pluck up his own 
spirits, and choosing a street at random, stept 
boldly forward in snow. 
Two things preoccupied him. as he went: the 
aspect of the gallows. at Montfaucon in this 
bright, windy phase of the night’s existence, for 
one; and for another, the look of the dead man 
with his bald head and garland of red enrls. 
Both struck. cold: upen his heart, and he kept 
quickening his pace as if he could escape from 
unpleasant thoughts by mere fleetness of. foot. 
Sometimes he looked back over his shoulder. with 
a‘sudden nervous jerk; but he was the only mov- 
ing thing in the white streets, except when the 
wind swooped around a corner and threw up the 
snow, which was beginning to freeze, in spouts of 
glittering ‘dust. 
Suddenly. he saw, a long way before him, a 
black clump and a couple of lanterns. The clump 
was in motion, and the lanterns swung as tho 
carried by men walking. It was a patrol. And 
tho it was merely erosding -bis line of march he

  judged it wiser to get out of eyeshot as speedily 
as he could. He was not in the humor ‘to ‘be 
challenged,-and he was conscious: of making & 
very conspicuous mark upon the snow. Just on 
his left hand there stood a great hotel, with some 
turrets and a-large porch before the door; it was 
half-ruinous, he remembered, and had long stood . 
empty; and so he made three steps of it, and 
jumped into the shelter of the porch. It was 
pretty dark inside, after the glimmer of the snowy 
streets, and he was groping forward with out- 
spread hands, when he stumbled over some sub- 
stance which offered an indescribable mixture of 
resistances, hard and soft, firm and loose. His. 
heart gave a leap, and he sprang two steps back 
and stared dreadfully at the obstacle. ‘Then he 
gave a little laugh of relief. It was only a woman, 
and she dead. He knelt beside her to make sure 
upon this latter point. She was freezing cold, and: 
rigid like a stick. A little ragged finery fluttered 
in the wind about her hair, and her cheeks:had 
been heavily rouged that same afternoon. - Her 
pockets were quite empty; but in her stocking, 
underneath the garter, Villon found two of the 
small coins that went by the name of whites. It 
was little enough; but it was always something; . 
and the poet was moved with a deep sense of 
pathos that she should have died before she had 
spent her money. That seemed to him a dark 
and pitiable mystery; and he looked from the: 
coins in his hand to the dead woman, and back 
again to the coins, shaking his head over the” 
riddle of man’s life. Henry V of England, dying

spend her couple of whites—it seemed a cruel 
way to carry on the world. Two whites would 
have taken such a little while to squander; and 
yet it ‘would have been one more good taste in 
the mouth, one more smack of the lips, before the 
devil got the soul, and the: body was left to birds 
and' vermin. He would like to use all his tallow 
before thé light was blown out and the lantern 
broken. 29° : 
“While these thoughts were passing through his 
mind, he was. feeling, half mechanically, for his 
urse. Suddenly his heart stopt beating; a feel- 
- amg of. cold seales passed up the back of his legs, 
and ‘a cold blow. seemed to fall upon his scalp. 
‘He stood: petrified for a moment; then he felt

left upon the snow: nothing was to be seen, He 
had not dropt it in-the streets. Had it fallen in 
the house? He would have liked dearly to go in 
and see; but the idea of the grizzly oceupant un- 
manned him. And he saw besides, as he drew 
near, that their efforts to put out the fire had been 
unsuceessful; on the contrary, it had broken into

brow beyond another; the ruins of a mighty and 
ancient fortress on the brink of oné; coves be-

  The idle manner of it was this: . oh 
Toward the end of September, when school-time 
was drawing near and the nights were already 
black, we would begin to sally from our respective’ 
villas, each equipped with a tin bull’s-eye lantern. 
The thing was so well known that it had wom a. 
rut in the ecommerce of Great Britain; and the 
grocers, about the due time, began to garnish their 
windows with our particular brand of luminary. = ' 
We wore them buckled to the waist upon a ericket . 
belt, and over them, sueh was the rigor of the 
game, a buttoned itop-coat. They smelled 
noisomely of blistered tin; they never burned 
aright, though they would always burn our 
fingers; their use was naught; the pleasure of. 
them merely fanciful; and yet a boy with a bull’s- | 
eye under his top-coat asked for nothing more. 
The fishermen used lanterns about their boats, 
and it was from them, I suppose, that we had got 
the hint; but theirs were not bull’s-eyes, nor did 
we ever play at being fishermen. The police ear- 
ried them at their belts, and we had plainly copied 
them in that; yet we did not pretend to be police- 
men. Burglars, indeed, we may have had some 
haunting thoughts of; and we had certainly an 
eye to past ages when lanterns were more com- 
mon, and to certain story-books in ‘which we had 
found them to figure very largely. But take it for 
all in all, the pleasure of the thing was substan- . 
tive; and to be a boy with a bull’s-eye under his 
top-coat was good enough for us. . 
‘When two of these asses met, there would be 
an anxious ‘‘Have you got your lantern?’’ and a 
gratified ‘‘Yes!’’ That was the shibboleth, and 
very needful too; for, as it was the rule to keep

fishing-boat, and delight themselves with inap- 
propriate talk.. Wo is me that I may not give 
~ gome specimens—some of their foresights of life, 
or deep inquiries into the rudiments of man and 
nature, these were so fiery and so innocent, they 
were so richly silly, so romantically young. But 
the talk, at any rate, was but.a condiment; and 
these gatherings themselves. only accidents in the 
eateer of the lantern-bearer. The essence of this 
bliss was to walk by yourself in the black night; 
the slide shut, the top-coat buttoned; not a ray 
escaping, whether to conduct your footsteps or te 
make your glory public: a mere pillar of dark- 
ness in the dark; and all the while deep. down in 
the privacy of your fool’s heart, to.know you had 
a bull’s-eye at your belt, and to exult and sing 
over the knowledge. .

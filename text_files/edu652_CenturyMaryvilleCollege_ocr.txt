FOREWORD 
Ir has been a characteristic of the institution of 
which this volume treats to win the devotion of its 
teachers and administrative officers to a degree never 
exceeded in the case of other institutions of learning. 
The College has always had connected with its man- 
agement workers who were so zealous that the in- 
stitution should efficiently serve its constituency, that 
they have counted no self-sacrifice or toilsome labor 
too extreme, if only they could see the College they 
loved realize their ambitions for it. The most con- 
spicuous embodiments of this devotion to Maryville 
College were President Anderson, the founder, and 
Professor Lamar, the second founder. It was the 
writer’s good fortune to be at first a student and then 
a colleague of Professor Lamar, who in turn was a 
student and then a colleague of Dr. Anderson; and 
so the writer received almost at first hand the story 
of Maryville, extending from the days of the begin- 
ning down to the time when he himself entered the 
faculty of the College. This story he has long felt 
it his duty to recount for the future sons and daugh- 
ters of Maryville, but not until now has he found 
time which he could devote to the pleasant task. 
If the lines in this character sketch of Maryville 
should seem to any to be too ardent, let the fact that 
v

  vi FOREWORD 
the writer has been connected with the College as stu- 
dent, alumnus, and professor for forty-three years 
explain and extenuate somewhat the warmth of his 
appreciative devotion. He is happy to know, more- 
over, that Maryville’s sons and daughters at any rate 
agree with him in believing that there is but one unique 
Maryville in all the galaxy of the colleges, and that 
no other institution shines with brighter, kindlier, or 
truer ray! : 
Although historical, this book is not a history. It 
is intended, as has already been intimated, to be a 
character sketch of Maryville College. The century 
just closing has been one of debate and discord and 
division in the domains of church and state. So fierce, 
for example, was denominational jealousy that Mary- 
ville College, though itself always liberal to all de- 
nominations, was for twenty-three long years denied 
a charter by the Legislature of Tennessee. Happily 
those days of narrowness are forever gone. The days 
of battling “Old School” and “New School” Presby- 
terians are also gone. Gone, too, is the ecclesiastical 
and political bitterness engendered by the Civil War. 
The College has emerged from a stormy but useful 
past into a more widely useful present, and has be- 
fore it what seems to be a vastly more useful future. 
The writer avails himself of his author’s license in 
omitting from this book the divisive matters of the 
past. The problems and the opportunities of the fu- 
ture are surely large enough to engross all the atten- 
tion and energy of the old friends of the College and 
of the new allies that are rallying to their assistance.
-P-A-G-E-11
FOREWORD Vil 
The writer takes this opportunity to thank the many 
friends who have assisted in clearing up obscure points 
of ante-bellum history. The destruction of almost 
all the ante-bellum records of the College has greatly 
increased the difficulty of his task; and so he is deeply 
grateful to the friends that have contributed informa- 
tion that has been so much the more valuable on ac- 
count of the absence of these official records. Espe- 
cially would he express his indebtedness to Mr. James 
A. Anderson, grand-nephew of Dr. Anderson, Mrs. 
Martha A. Lamar, widow of Professor Lamar, and 
Major William A. McTeer. 
The accuracy of the book has profited greatly by the 
criticisms of eight or more friends of the College that 
have read the manuscript. The excellence and appro- 
priateness of the thirty-six illustrations employed in 
the volume are largely due to Professor Clinton H. Gil- 
lingham, who spared no pains in their selection and 
preparation. To all who have, in any way, contributed 
to the value of this tribute to Maryville, the writer 
hereby expresses his sincere thanks.

  A CENTURY OF 
MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
PART FIRST: THE ANTE-BELLUM 
MARYVILLE 
CHAPTER I 
THE GREAT SOUTHWEST AND Its CHALLENGE 
BeroreE the Great West had received its name and 
had excited the imagination and largely engrossed the 
attention of the American people, 
there already existed, on the one 
hand, a “Great Northwest Terri- 
tory,” and, on the other, “a Great Southwest” region, 
that were also the cynosure of many eager eyes. 
From 1790 to 1796 the region afterward called Ten- 
nessee was known as “the Southwest Territory,” but 
“the Great Southwest” included much more than that 
one territory. In 1800 the region extending from the 
Smoky Mountains westward to the Mississippi River 
and southward to the Gulf of Mexico, including, 
roughly speaking, what is now covered by the States 
of Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi, was 
I The Southwest 
of 1800 A. D.
-P-A-G-E-22
2 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
known as the Great Southwest. Although containing 
200,150 square miles of area, it was occupied by a 
population of only 277,138. By 1810 the same region 
had a population of 554,512; and by 1820 its popula- 
tion amounted to 967,105. It is with this Southwest 
that we have to deal. 
The Southwest was in that day the land of promise. 
It promised immediate benefits. There were cheap 
farms and healthful homes for the 
ao of immigrants and for their children. 
It was to the more crowded regions 
of the seaboard and the adjoining inland country an 
alluring ultramontane Italy, or a land of Canaan, with 
vines and fig trees, and milk and honey. It promised 
not only immediate good but also later benefits. There 
would be comfort and competence in coming days 
when the wilderness had been subdued and the land 
had been filled with homes and, as Livingstone would 
have phrased it, with “the pleasant haunts of men.” 
And this Southwest land also promised ultimate bene- 
fits of great value. It would be a land of destiny, 
filled with the wealth “of Ormus or of Ind,” as the 
course of empire should press westward. It was, in- 
deed, a land of boundless promise. 
However, it was by no means as yet a land of reali- 
zation, promising though it was. It was rather what 
even more than a century later its 
teins purely mountain communities have 
been called—‘“a land of do with- 
out.” In fact all frontier lands have been lands of 
  necessary makeshifts and ingenious substitutes, but
-P-A-G-E-23

especially of the stern limiting of one’s wants to his 
bare necessities and to the even narrower possibilities 
of the case. This absence of the comforts and the 
commodities of civilization is the price paid for their 
precedence by the advance agents of civilization. The 
Great Southwest was a land of “do-without” luxuries, 
and almost of “do-without” necessities. 
The present-day descendant of the pioneer, if trans- 
lated by genii to the pioneer times and the log home of 
his ancestor, would look in vain 
about the simple cabin and the log 
barn for most of those utilities that are now deemed 
indispensable to the comfort of the home and to the 
management of the farm. But there were also in the 
isolated frontier homes of the Southwest many days 
when even hunger haunted the brave founders of em- 
pire, just as there had been years of broken slumber 
and anxious fear on account of “the red peril’ that 
had menaced them by day and by night. And these 
pioneer privations were felt the more keenly by some 
who experienced them, because in their old homes be- 
yond the mountains or beyond the seas they had lived 
in comparative quiet and comfort. 
Privations, however, are not so serious as are de- 
privations. Privations are usually transient and tem- 
porary; deprivations are apt to be more permanent. 
There were privations involved in 
the very constitution of the log 
age; but so long as near the log- 
cabin home, the log barn, and the log court-house, 
there were also a log schoolhouse and a log church, Pioneer Privations 
Pioneer 
Deprivations 
 
-P-A-G-E-24
  4 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
the sorest deprivations had not been experienced. 
But there were many places in the new and wild South- 
west where the intellectual and spiritual interests of the 
people were either entirely unprovided for or very 
imperfectly provided for. In such communities a piti- 
ful poverty of the best things of life prevailed; the 
deprivation of the essential conditions of wholesome 
and normal life prevented those best things of life 
from being developed. And there were many com- 
munities that suffered such pioneer deprivations. 
The people of the extensive territory comprised ‘in 
the Southwest of 1800 had in many sections, of neces- 
sity, as a result of frontier conditions, and of the 
breaking of old ties, and by rea- 
a Things son of the isolation and the reck- 
lessness of the frontier, lost many 
of the best things that had belonged to them in the 
old country and in their first homes in America. 
Among these best things that disappeared were the tra- 
ditions of the past—traditions national, racial, and 
family—traditions that in many cases were laid aside, 
and, for lack of use, were forgotten, and finally lost. 
Some of these traditions, it was true, might better 
have been lost; but most of them were invaluable and 
purchased by their ancestors at great price. 
There, too, were the education and the considerable 
degree of culture of the fathers and mothers that 
were sometimes largely lost to the sons and daugh- 
ters because these were brought up in an unfavorable 
environment. But chief of all was the loss a sad and 
tragic one when a family’s religion failed to stand the

test of transplantation into a new and rough country. 
The Southwest land, however, was happy in the 
fact that it did not lose its virile stock. Great fam- 
ilies of young people who, in many cases, grew up 
to be stalwart men and strong 
= jar People women, swarmed about the log 
houses of that period. The country 
was but sparsely settled, but a populous generation 
was scattered all over it and multiplied with great 
and divinely-blessed rapidity. Whatever deficit of 
assets might exist in other respects, there was a wealth 
of assets to be found in the young people that were 
crowded in the log-cabin homes of the land. 
That was long before the days of the free public- 
school idea, and the State did nothing for education. 
What schools there were available, were article, or 
subscription schools; and the pres- 
sure of toil, the absence of money, 
the lack of interest and of inter- 
ested leaders, and the imperfect supply of even poorly- 
equipped teachers tended to reduce to a minimum the 
number of such schools. With few books or no 
books in the home, and with no school in the com- 
munity, and with little leisure on the part of the 
parents, there was many an instance of intellectual 
famine for the new generation where there had been 
a sufficiency of education for the older generation. 
“How can I, except some man should teach me?” 
was the question of the wayfaring man. Where was 
the Philip that was to teach the frontiersman? A Dearth 
of Education 
   
-P-A-G-E-26
  6 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
A real and threatening danger here! What will 
become of the land if its people perish for lack of 
: knowledge? No schools or poor 
ore schools meant declension in intel- 
: ligence, education, and culture; de- 
terioration in moral ideals, stamina, and character; 
and disintegration and dilapidation of the political 
structure of the Southwest. By the irresistible logic 
of cause and effect, illiteracy and its consequence, igno- 
rance, would in their ugly train bring a declension 
that would, unless checked, ultimately lead many rep- 
resentatives of a noble race downward even toward 
degeneracy. It would have been unpatriotic and un- 
christian and foolish in the extreme to ignore the 
danger that was impending over the Southwest. 
The country was yet new, financial capital was yet 
wanting, and the population, thanks to a kind Provi- 
dence and a prolific frontier fe- 
ca cundity, was rapidly increasing. 
The industrious race that peopled 
the region lived in the days when as yet primitive 
methods of farming and manufacture prevailed, and 
when machinery and steam and electricity had not 
yet come to add to man’s efficiency. It was mainly 
man power, aided by horse power and ox power, and 
by some water power, that earned man his livelihood. 
And this making a living kept the people busy from 
early cock-crowing till after candle-lighting. 
So busily were men employed in earning their living 
that there was real danger in the meantime of their 
losing their lives. When, in order to win their daily
-P-A-G-E-27
THE GREAT SOUTHWEST 7 
bread, they were compelled not merely to work but 
also to labor and toil and drudge throughout the years, 
it was easy to be so engrossed as 
to forget the need of the bread 
that cometh down from heaven. 
The daily grind was in danger of crushing the real 
life out of the soul, even while grinding out bread 
for the body. And all thoughtful patriots and Chris- 
tians saw the risk and feared the outcome; and, pleas- 
ant it is to say, some of them rendered invaluable 
service in attempting to ward off the impending dan- 
ger from the nascent commonwealths of the South- 
west and from their people. 
The early settlers of what is now Tennessee were 
a very patriotic and liberty-loving people. They 
formed for “the Watauga Associa- 
on oe tion,” in 1772, the first written con- 
stitution made by native Ameri- 
cans; and, in 1775, they erected the first geographical 
division named for him who was to be “the Father 
of his Country,” but who had then just assumed the 
command of the army at Boston; and, in 1780, they 
established, on the Cumberland River, an independent 
government called “the Cumberland Compact”; and 
in 1784, in the eastern part of the region, they dared 
to found “the State of Franklin.” This determination 
to have law and order and liberty was a distinguish- 
ing mark of the founders of the State; and a high 
degree of patriotism was bequeathed by them to their 
sons and successors in leadership. 
The danger of the occultation, by ignorance and In Danger of

-P-A-G-E-28

its attendant clouds, of the rising sun of liberty and 
virtue in the Southwest did not escape the alarmed 
notice of many patriots of Tennessee and the regions 
beyond. Tennessee had become a State in 1796, the 
first State to be carved out of the United States ter- 
ritory, and the patriots of Tennessee wished it to de- 
velop into an honored commonwealth; and they saw 
in the menace of illiteracy a challenge to their own 
patriotism to seek to ward off that menace. 
While stern necessity kept many good men so busy 
that they scarcely had time to note the dangers that 
menaced them, and while the sel- 
cio Philantireyiit fishness of a gross frontier materi- 
alism made many others entirely in- 
different to the cause of education and religion, there 
were many lovers of their kind who were sad of 
heart and who suffered a holy discontent on account 
of the dangers that threatened both themselves and 
the rising generation in the Southwest. They saw in 
the dearth of educational and religious privileges in 
the region in which they lived the occasion and cause 
of the breaking open of a Pandora’s box of mischiefs 
in it. Furthermore, they read in this condition of 
affairs a summons to their love of man and of God 
to help to supply the needs of their people and to 
avert disaster to the state and the church. And many 
worthy lives were dedicated to the work of saving their 
adopted and already beloved land of the Southwest. 
The challenge was, as has just been said, accepted 
by some patriotic and philanthropic men throughout the
-P-A-G-E-29
  THE GREAT SOUTHWEST 9 
region; and, against great odds, these worthies ren- 
dered a service whose beneficent influence was so great 
as to be beyond the possibility 
poviione eat of human computation. They 
planned for schools, and secured 
teachers or themselves taught schools, and established 
churches and secured preachers or themselves became 
preachers, in order that learning and religion might 
not perish from the face of the land. The adven- 
turous and brave pioneers furnished some of these 
men, while the next generation not only found them 
just as necessary but also realized that they were 
needed in larger number than before. To the honor 
of religion, let it be said that it was the church that 
saved education, and, of course, religion, in that crisis. 
The debt of gratitude that the nation owes in other 
sections of the land to the Christian ministry for 
the keeping alive of education in the early days is 
fully recognized on every hand; and certainly no 
one can question that that debt is a great one in the 
Southwest, where practically all the teachers of the 
higher grades and many of the teachers of the lower 
grades were the preachers who everywhere carried with 
them, as the tools of their trade, the school book and 
the Bible.

  CHAPTER II 
Isaac ANDERSON AND His VISION 
Tue Great Teacher magnified his profession. He 
said: “Ye call me Teacher, and Lord: and ye say 
well; for so 1 am.” Many of his 
ooo followers have tried to do as he 
has done unto them; and so they 
have taught others the learning both of earth and 
of heaven. (Practically all the early academies and 
schools of higher education in Tennessee and the 
Southwest were established by the preachers of the 
frontier, and, principally, by the Presbyterian preach-) 
ers. The heaven-impelled preacher-educators, Samuel 
Doak, Hezekiah Balch, Samuel Carrick, Charles Cof- 
fin, Gideon Blackburn, Isaac Anderson, and others 
that might be mentioned, left behind them legacies of 
influence as educators that have enriched the past and 
the present of the region they loved so truly and 
served so richly. 
As almost all of these educators could trace their 
lineage back, by the way of the North of Ireland, to 
ee Scotland, so could the schools that 
oe they established trace their honor- 
able and lineal descent from the 
schools of that same land of worthy beginnings. The 
10
-P-A-G-E-31

schools in every parish and the college in every notable 
town, that John Knox and his followers planned for 
in the Book of Discipline, were the ideals that the 
American pedagogues of the Southwest tried also 
to realize. And sad would have been the loss to 
the frontier had they failed to attempt to carry into 
effect the program of Knox. At first almost every 
Presbyterian preacher was also a school-teacher; and 
every one was the friend and champion of education. 
Indeed, he was almost invariably the best educated 
man in his community. To him as a steward of God’s 
grace had been committed not merely the standards 
of faith but also those of education; and he tried 
faithfully to fulfill his double ministry. 
One of the centers of educational interest for the 
Southwest from which radiated in many directions 
: the influences that were fostered 
a Rockbridge there, was Rockbridge County, in ounty Training cre cy Ground the Valley of Virginia. That 
county was settled almost exclu- 
sively by Scotch-Irishmen. They brought with them 
their principles, and tried to perpetuate them by 
founding schools and churches in which their chil- 
dren could be disciplined in intellectual culture and, 
at the same time, indoctrinated with high and worthy 
moral and religious ideals. They established com- 
munity schools and even academies in their various 
congregations. 
Liberty Hall Academy is the most famous of these 
schools of Rockbridge County. From this institution 
many went forth to establish elsewhere in the South- 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
  12 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
west what they had learned to prize under its tuition. 
The names of Drs. Samuel Carrick, Samuel Doak, 
Samuel G. Ramsey, and Isaac Anderson are house- 
hold words in East Tennessee as names of educators 
or founders of its educational institutions, and they 
were all educated in Rockbridge County, 
In the church called New Providence, located on 
the northern edge of Rockbridge County, the people 
._, of the congregation supported a 
ee subscription school which was 
taught by a Scotch dominie. A 
little lad named Isaac Anderson entered this school 
as soon as he was old enough to attend; and here 
he continued in attendance for several years. The 
dominie was an efficient teacher and his drill was 
thorough and persistent. He commanded the respect 
of his pupils. He feared God, and did his utmost 
to train the children also in the same fear. Every 
morning he read the Scriptures to them and prayed 
with them; and throughout the entire day he taught 
them in a practical way how to realize the chief end 
of man. It was evident that another Teacher was 
also present in the school who instructed in heavenly 
wisdom both teacher and pupil. 
The lad, Isaac Anderson, merits our attention, for 
without him the story this book has to tell could not 
ee have been written. On March 26, 
? 1780, in a farmhouse near New 
Bootch-Irishman Providence Church, and about 
twelve miles north of Lexington, Rockbridge County, 
Virginia, Isaac Anderson was born, the oldest of the

seven children of William Anderson and his wife, 
Nancy McCampbell Anderson. His ancestors had 
come from County Down, in the North of Ireland. 
They were sturdy representatives of that indomitable 
Protestant Scotch-Irish stock that has always refused 
to be defeated, but fortunately for the world has gen- 
erally been on the right side of the issues that have 
been battled over. Both his great-grandfather, Isaac 
Anderson, and his great-grandmother, on his paternal 
side, and his great-grandparents, the Shannons, in the 
McCampbell line, on his maternal side, were present 
at the siege of Londonderry in 1688. The Anderson 
family and the McCampbell family, also of Scotch- 
Irish stock, with whom they became intimately con- 
nected, settled in Rockbridge County, Virginia, while 
it was yet Augusta County and a very new country. 
William Anderson, his father, besides being a good 
herdsman and farmer, was a great hunter and a prac- 
tised rifleman. He was a soldier at Point Pleasant on 
the Kanawha, and in other Indian campaigns. Nancy 
McCampbell Anderson, his wife, was born in America 
in 1757, two years after her parents, James and Mary 
Shannon McCampbell, came from Ireland to Rock- 
bridge County, Virginia. 
William Anderson was a Christian man, and the 
priest of his family. The fire upon his family altar, 
according to the law of God, was 
always burning; it never went out, 
even in the busy days of the har- 
vest. Morning and evening a hymn was sung, a pas- 
sage of Scripture read, and a fervent prayer offered. His Schooling 
in the Home 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
14 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
Mr. Anderson gave his children the best school edu- 
cation the times afforded; but the education given 
in the home was better than all else. He and his 
good wife trained their seven children to honor God’s 
day and God’s book and God’s law. The children 
were taken to church from the days of infancy, and 
were guided to walk in wisdom’s ways. All of them 
remained under the parental roof until their maturity, 
and thus received the full benefit of this long-con- 
tinued home training. They grew up to be a notable 
family of tall, large, and well-formed men and 
women. 
Isaac, the eldest son, received special and price- 
less benefit from the guidance given his youthful feet 
by his maternal grandmother, Mary Shannon Mc- 
Campbell, who lived in the home and whose special 
care and favorite he was. She taught him to spell 
and to read, to love God and to pray to him. She 
would tell him of her parents’ experiences at the 
siege of Derry, and especially of the rescue of her 
wounded father from almost certain death through 
the kind-heartedness of a Catholic girl. Amid the 
heroic traditions and consistent piety of such a home, 
Isaac Anderson was prepared for his important life- 
work. 
It is not to be wondered at that in such a home 
‘there should have been developed seven worthy and 
substantial men and women of force and usefulness. 
Of the conspicuous service rendered by Isaac Ander- 
son this book will have much to say. Three of his 
brothers, Robert M., William E., and Samuel, were

all able lawyers and judges of circuit courts, making 
such a galaxy of legal ability as few families could 
boast; the other brother, James, was a successful 
farmer, and a colonel of militia; while the two sisters, 
Mary and Margaret, married respectively to William 
McCampbell and Bennet McCampbell, showed their 
strength of character in the sterling worth of the 
families they trained for usefulness. 
The Scotch dominie taught his school in a log house 
about a mile from the Anderson home. Before Isaac 
was old enough to attend regularly, 
oa the neighbor boys would some- 
times carry him on their backs to 
the school. There he was deeply impressed with 
the singing and the praying of the school-teacher, and 
afterward said that it produced in him “a great and 
lasting impression for good.” The dominie was strict 
and earnest, and imparted to the children an excellent 
common-school education. By the time the precocious 
Isaac was seven years old, it is alleged that the lad 
could “read any of the less difficult Latin authors.” 
Thus early did he reveal the spirit of a scholar. 
In 1749 the first classical school west of the Blue 
Ridge was founded by Robert Alexander, near Green- 
se ville, in Augusta County, Virginia. 
an aioe After various changes of location 
and principals the academy was 
located, in 1785, in a stone building, one mile distant 
from Lexington. In 1796, President George Wash- 
ington presented the academy one hundred shares of 
the James River Company. The name of the school
-P-A-G-E-38
  | | 16 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
was then changed from Liberty Hall Academy to 
Washington Academy. Washington and Lee Uni- 
versity is the continuation of this institution. 
As young Isaac Anderson had enjoyed the best tui- 
tion in the home and in the subscription school, he 
now had, in Liberty Hall Acadervy, the guidance of 
the best teacher of the Valley, Rev. William Graham, 
a graduate of Princeton and a very able man. Under 
him Anderson “pursued his classical studies with 
faithfulness, diligence, and success.” He entered 
when fifteen or sixteen years of age, and continued 
until he completed his studies, which, presumably, cov- 
ered the course of study then offered. Favored young 
men were those who were trained by Mr. Graham. 
After Anderson had completed the course in Wash- 
ington Academy, for this name was adopted while 
he was a student, he gave his time for a while to the 
reading of history and literature. 
He had now received what the best schools of his 
neighborhood could give him. To what profession 
or occupation should he devote his

periences that had transformed his 
views of life. A few years later, in 1797, when seven- 
teen years old, he united with the New Providence 
Presbyterian Church, in Rockbridge County. 
For two years thereafter he debated within him- 
self the question of a life occupation. At one time 
he decided to enter the law office of an uncle as a 
law student, as a cousin had done. But his conscience
-P-A-G-E-39
.. Noble Purpose ISAAC ‘ANDERSON AND HIS VISION 17 
seemed to lead him toward the gospel ministry, and, 
at the end of the two years, he fully and confidently 
decided to study for the ministry. 
He promptly presented himself before Lexington 
Presbytery and was taken under its care as a candi- 
date for the ministry. As yet there was no theologi- 
cal seminary in the United States, and, in accordance 
with the custom of the times, he studied theology 
under his pastor. This minister was Rev. Samuel 
Brown, a learned, logical, and thoughtful divine whose 
ability had won for him the title of the “Edwards 
of Virginia.” His illustrious pupil, later on, in his 
own teaching, adopted the plan of instruction em- 
ployed by Mr. Brown. It was workable. He also 
assisted his preceptor in the school which he taught 
in his congregation, and gained experience there as 
a teacher that was to be of service to him in coming 
days. 
As he pursued his studies in divinity, there de- 
veloped within him a great determination to do the 
utmost possible with the life en- 
trusted to him, in the bringing of 
his fellow men to higher attain- 
ments in education and character. It was a time of 
too much dead formalism in the churches; but the 
unction of this governing purpose marked him as a 
prophet of better things for the church. 
The drift of emigration continued down the Shenan- 
doah Valley and spread out through the outpouring 
cornucopia of the Southwest. In October, 1801, Wil- 
liam Anderson, his wife, his parents, his mother-in- The Birth of a 
 
-P-A-G-E-40

law, and his children were caught in this drift and 
removed from Rockbridge County, Virginia, to Knox 
County, Tennessee. A family cara- 
van, with wagons and cattle and 
other possessions, they made their 
way down the forest-arched roads that led to central 
East Tennessee, and found them a new home in Grassy 
Valley, near House Mountain. Westward, southwest- 
ward, the course of the Scotch-Irishmen had steadily 
been pouring. In Grassy Valley the Andersons found 
a beautiful and fruitful section where a good home 
could be established, and here they planted themselves. 
Better homes and better farms for the children had 
thus been sought and found. 
The Valley of Virginia was a choice region that 
was now filled with the happy homes of a rapidly in- 
creasing race. The Valley of East 
Tennessee, one of the most re- 
markable of nature’s sheltered and 
favored preserves to be found in any of the Tem- 
perate Zones, was decided by William Anderson, who 
spied out the land before the family removed, to be 
,also one of earth’s choicest regions. In I80I it was 
istill frontier territory, and still seemed, as viewed 
‘from its heights, to be covered with almost seamless 
xarpets of green forests. And here, in our day, many 
‘of the lineal descendants of the pioneer of 1801 are 
grateful for their ancestor’s judgment and prescience 
that selected for the home of the family a modern 
Garden of Eden in the very center of “God’s Coun- 
try.” In the Anderson family burying-ground in Westward, Ho,

Transplantation has made some trees take on a new 
life; and the transplantation of Isaac Anderson gave 
him a new and larger purpose. As he saw more of 
the world, and of its crying needs, he became the 
more eager to minister to those needs. 
There entered also into his theological thinking, 
at this time, the much-bruited doctrine of “disin- 
terested benevolence”—a doctrine that in the case of 
many had only a theoretic and curious interest; but 
one that in his case was of especial value because 
powerfully exemplified by his own practice and 
strongly commended to others by his own unselfish 
life. Isaac Anderson, twenty-one years of age, had 
reached manhood’s estate; and now there was pre- 
sented before his eyes what ere long came to be al- 
most an apostolic vision of service.

CHAPTER III 
IsAAC ANDERSON AND His “Loc CoLLEGE” 
IsAAc ANDERSON, the student, ended his formal 
school-days soon after he reached his new home in 
East Tennessee. For a few months 
he continued his theological studies 
under Dr. Samuel Carrick, the 
president of Blount College, at Knoxville, receiving 
some help also from Dr. Gideon Blackburn, of Mary- 
ville. Great men, both of them, and they greatly 
kindled his intellectual! fires. 
But his school-days came to an end. On Saturday, 
May 28, 1802, Union Presbytery in session at Eusebia 
licensed hiin—its first licentiate to the gospel minis- 
try; and on Thursday, November 26, of the same 
year, he was ordained to the ministry by the same 
presbytery, and was installed pastor of the Washing- 
ton Church, then just organized in Upper Grassy Val- 
ley by Dr. Carrick. To this charge was added, later 
on, the church of Lebanon-in-the-Forks—the forks of 
the French Broad and Holston Rivers. 
In a very true sense, however, his school-days never 
ended. Throughout his life he was an indefatigable 
student. In spite of almost inconceivably toilsome 
labors, he devoted himself to study; and even down

ISAAC ANDERSON’S “LOG COLLEGE” = 21 
to old age continued to study hard and exhaustively. 
Never, strictly speaking, a college student, always was 
it true that “he was a student out of college.” 
Isaac Anderson’s ordination to the ministry served 
also as a consecration to the work of a teacher. On 
Sabbaths he ascended the pulpit, 
and on Mondays, for the week that 
followed, he ascended the school- 
room platform. For fifty years he was one of the 
most diligent and efficient of teachers. He had tried 
his apprentice hand in the school taught by his pre- 
ceptor in theology, Rev. Samuel Brown. And now 
he began his remarkable career as pedagogue in his 
new East Tennessee home. 
Just after his ordination he established in Grassy 
Valley on his farm—the one now owned by the 
Samuel Harris family—a classical academy or “col- 
lege,” as it was popularly called. He named it Union 
Academy, perhaps in honor of Union Presbytery, then 
an organization only four years old. This academy 
was prosperous and useful to a degree that rewarded 
and also demanded a large expenditure of labor and 
self-denial. 
Among the afterwards more distinguished students 
of tie school were his four brothers, his cousin, Rev. 
ore Lor Col- John McCampbell, and Governor 
lies," oN xeynolds of [llinois. The acad- 
Academy, 1802  ©™y was also an embryo theologi- 
’ cal seminary, for he had some stu- 
dents in theology who found it convenient to meet him 
in the academy building. He had so lively a taste School-Teaching 
Begun
-P-A-G-E-44
22 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
for educational work that he was an enthusiastic 
teacher, and imparted dignity to the work by the 
method of his performance of it. The academy be- 
came a frontier Grove of Academus. This school 
was the predecessor of Maryville College. It might 
almost properly be said that Maryville College was 
founded in 1802, for it was the same great teacher 
who conducted his educational work without a break 
through his academy, seminary, and college, down to 
the time of his disability through old age. 
Dr. Anderson’s log academy building was a credit- 
able one—almost a pretentious one—for the times. It 
was a large, hewn-log, double build- 
yi tiny Buildin ing, thirty feet by seventy, two 
stories high, and contained four 
large rooms besides the porch or hallway between 
the rooms. From this hallway the stairway ascended 
to the second floor. The seats and tables or desks 
were, of course, home-made. Large fireplaces were 
in use during the cold weather. The building com- 
manded respect for its size, convenience, and com- 
fort, and was known throughout the county as “Mr. 
Anderson’s log college.” 
There was as yet no city problem on the Southwest 
frontier, for there was as yet no city; but there was 
everywhere a country problem, for 
all was country, and all was com- 
paratively new and crude and un- 
made. As a countryman intensely concerned about 
his neighbors and their children and all their interests, 
Isaac Anderson devoted himself with head and heart An Early Country- 
Life Movement

and hand to the working out of what would now be 
termed a country-life movement. 
His community centers were the church, where he 
led the worship and instructed and inspired the peo- 
ple on the Sabbath day, and the school, where dur- 
ing the week days he gave the young people of the 
community and of other communities as good an edu- 
cation as could be found in the country districts in 
those days. | 
From these community centers—the church and the 
home—presided over by this alert and benevolent high 
priest of religion and education for the frontier, 
worthy and elevating influences radiated into all the 
homes of the community, and informed and inspired 
and conserved the social life, the husbandry, and the 
moral and political welfare of the people. Rallied 
around the church and school centers and their in- 
spiring leader, the people established and developed 
in their community a country life of such culture and 
general excellence as has made the community dis- 
tinguished for its high standing in intelligence, edu- 
cation, law and order, morality, and religion—in short, 
for the chief excellencies of our Anglo-Saxon civili- 
zation. 
This leader of that early country-life movement 
was kept very busy in carrying out his program for 
the uplift and welfare of his com- 
munity and of its young people. 
On Sundays he conducted divine worship twice, the 
people coming from all over the county to attend the 
forenoon and afternoon services. Dinner was brought Perpetual Motion

in baskets. At each service the preacher delivered 
a well thought-out, instructive, earnest, and eloquent 
address, which profoundly affected and inspired the 
hearers. The moral and intellectual nature in man 
was led to a royal banquet by this kingly preacher. 
Then during the week came the daily work of the 
academy, and of the students of divinity, and the re- 
ligious work of a large community, besides the cares 
of his own farm, which must be so run as to supply 
the living that in those days could not be expected 
to be derived only from church and school. Nothing 
but ceaseless activity and untiring diligence could 
carry forward so extensive a program of work. And 
there was no Monday or Saturday or Sabbath rest 
that intervened to intermit this endless round of toil. 
Nothing less than perpetual motion could meet the de- 
mands of the case; and so this community worker 
discovered what many have sought after—the secret 
of perpetual motion. 
Some men can never be content with their achieve- 
ments; they can not let well enough alone! Isaac 
Anderson was one of those rest- 
less geniuses. He saw his own 
community prospering under his 
leadership, and was thankful. But he looked beyond 
the limits of his community, and was concerned, 
deeply concerned, about the communities beyond in 
which he learned that no one was working, or work- 
ing efficiently, for their uplift. His eager soul saw 
these communities like so many Macedonias beckon- 
ing him to their help. His unselfish spirit could re- Extension Work

turn but one answer to these calls, and that answer 
must be the response of his presence and help, within 
the limits of his ability. The annoying difficulty that 
intervened was the fact that he could not be ubiqui- 
tous. But, after all, with the aid of perpetual motion 
a great deal of ground can be covered and a large 
amount of work can be done. And so into his saddle 
he vaulted, and went out in search of more service 
for his people. And he found it awaiting him in large 
quantities. 
One summer he rode horseback over most of the 
mountainous counties of central East Tennessee, and 
as far westward as Fentress County in Middle Ten- 
nessee; and everywhere he preached to the people, 
and pitied their frontier destitution. A biography, 
“The Life of Whitefield,’ helped also to kindle his 
apostolic ambition and enthusiasm, and he determined 
to supply in his own person the lack of religious lead- 
ership, so far as he could. To this end he marked 
out a circuit of about one hundred and fifty miles 
which he covered during one week every month, for 
several years, leaving home on Monday morning and 
returning home on the following Saturday. He spoke 
sometimes to small companies, and sometimes to thou- 
sands. In this circuit-riding he was occasionally as- 
sisted by his cousin, Rev. John McCampbell. This, 
surely, was an approved form of university extension 
work, also practised at an early day. 
It would seem that Isaac Anderson, greedy as he 
was to do good on a large scale, might have been

content with the dimensions of his task as he 
then had it outlined. Pioneer, frontiersman, herds- 
man, farmer, teacher, circuit-rider, 
preacher, pastor, theological in- 
structor, and Protestant father 
confessor for all the region, his service surely was ex- 
tensive and intensive enough for any man. And yet 
in 1811 he wrote as follows: “I have for some years 
past viewed my situation with silent dissatisfaction. 
My sphere of action, both as a minister of the gospel 
and a teacher, has been too limited. I have often felt 
the conviction that I am not serving my day and 
generation in any suitable manner.” And in order 
to serve more widely he was willing to sacrifice his 
own personal and financial interests. 
After Dr. Anderson had labored in Knox County 
nine years, he received a call to the pastorate of 
the New Providence Presbyterian 
ace Church of Maryville, in the ad- 
joining county of Blount. This 
church had been organized probably as early as 1786; 
and had now been developed, under the powerful 
ministry of Dr. Gideon Blackburn, into one of the 
most important churches in East Tennessee. Dr. 
Blackburn had resigned in 1810, and had removed to 
Middle Tennessee. 
Since “the strength and body of Presbyterianism 
lay there”—about Maryville—and since, for that rea- 
son, it was a favorable center for the larger work 
which he coveted, Dr. Anderson felt it his duty to 
accept this call, although at a financial loss to him- Ambition to Serve 
Yet More Widely 
 
-P-A-G-E-51
    ISAAC ANDERSON’S “LOG COLLEGE” 27 
self. He was ambitious, not for position, but for 
more work, and thus for more usefulness. 
He took leave of his parishioners of Washington 
Church, and of his other church, “Lebanon-in-the- 
Forks,” with great sorrow; and, in the fall of 1811, 
began his labors in Maryville. In November, 1812, 
he removed to Maryville, taking with him his acad- 
emy—except its building—and was there installed pas- 
tor of the church. This pastorate continued until 
1856, the year before his death. 
In Grecian days there were peripatetic teachers in 
the grove of Academus, but in the days of which we 
are speaking, both instructor and 
academy were peripatetic. Dr. 
Anderson brought his academy 
with him the twenty-five miles that lay between 
Grassy Valley and Maryville. Whether it was still 
called Union Academy is not certain; but it was 
the same academy with its identical faculty of one. 
From the time he removed to Maryville, he was 
constantly engaged in teaching. Says Professor La- 
mar: “He first taught in an old academy building 
then standing on the lot now (1885) occupied by the 
jail; and then in an old log cabin which stood on 
the bank of the creek where the railroad culvert now 
crosses it. He had a few students in theology, and 
a number in general literature, some of whom be- 
came prominent in public life, and others equally so in 
the learned professions.” 
Among the young men attending the academy was 
the picturesque Sam Houston, afterwards the hero of Translation of 
the Academy
-P-A-G-E-52
  28 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
Texas—its military chieftain and the first president 
of the Lone Star Republic. Mrs. Houston, his 
widowed mother, had brought her 
family of nine children from the 
hive of Rockbridge County, Vir- 
ginia, and found a home near Baker’s Creek, not far 
from the Little Tennessee River, about twelve miles 
from Maryville, and on the border line between the 
whites and the Indians. 
- Young Houston received practically all his school 
training from Dr. Anderson. As would be expected, 
he was more interested in playing war and in drilling 
the boys in military tactics than in study. But he was 
a young man of remarkably keen and close observa- 
tion. 
Dr. Anderson said of him: “Many times did I de- 
termine to give Sam Houston a whipping for neglect 
of study, but he would come into the schoolroom 
bowing and scraping, with as fine a dish of apologies 
as ever was placed before anybody, and withal so 
very polite and manly for one of his age, that it took 
all the whip out of me; I could not find it in my 
heart to whip him.” 
During the War of 712, volunteers for the cam- 
paign against the Creek Indians were called for, and 
Houston quit school, joined the army, and a few 
months later distinguished himself at the Battle of the 
Bend of the Tallapoosa, where he received three 
wounds. Several of his relatives have graduated at 
Maryville in recent years; one of them, Samuel O. 
Houston, serving also as a director of the College. Sam Houston,

Dr. Anderson, like most of his Scotch-Irish kins- 
men, was very patriotic. During the War of ’12 he 
“Chavlai was chaplain of a brigade of Ten- 
i ey ee nessee soldiery that was command- 
War of °12 ed by General White. At the old 
| Hiwassee Garrison he preached a 
fervidly patriotic discourse on the text: “Curse ye 
Meroz, said the angel of the Lord, curse ye bitterly 
the inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the 
help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord against the 
mighty.”—Judges v: 23. 
In this sermon he pointed out the fact that the moral 
cause of the war and its troubles was to be found 
in the sins of the American people. These sins the 
people should immediately abandon. The political 
cause of the war, however, was “the injustice of the 
French and British governments.” “As it regards the 
political cause of this war, we are on the Lord’s side. 
We should arm ourselves in the fear of God for bat- 
tle, for we have not sinned against Britain but Britain 
against us. ... The call of country is the call of 
God.” 
During the first seven years of his work at Mary- 
ville, Dr. Anderson usually had, besides his academy 
students, one or two theological 
students. These sometimes lived 
in his home, and found at his fire- 
side a school of the prophets that was at once home- 
like and schoollike. Here he trained such leaders as 
Dr. Abel Pearson, the author of a book on the prophe- 
cies; and Dr. William Eagleton, the brilliant orator Vocational Work 
by the Fireside
-P-A-G-E-54
  30 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
and logician of Murfreesboro. Another one whom he 
trained was George M. Erskine, a slave whose freedom 
was purchased by Union Presbytery and who was li- 
censed in 1818, and ten years later went out to Africa 
as the first foreign missionary from the presbytery. 
In 1818, Dr. Gideon Blackburn sent his son, James H. 
Blackburn, to study Hebrew under Dr. Anderson ; but, 
three months later, the young man, a very promising 
candidate for the ministry, died in Dr. Anderson’s 
house after a very brief illness. Dr. Blackburn pub- 
lished the sermon that Dr. Anderson preached at the 
funeral service. 
This vocational work by. the fireside was the pre- 
cursor of the larger work soon to be inaugurated. 
And the self-sacrificing labor required in order to 
train these individual students would seem appalling 
in these days of large numbers and of the thorough 
organization of vocational institutions; but it was 
a labor of love on the part of this apostle of the South- 
west. 3

  CHAPTER IV 
Dr. ANDERSON AND His SouTHERN AND WESTERN 
SEMINARY 
So far as the demands of his academy and theologi- 
cal students and large church and parish would al- 
: low, Dr. Anderson continued his 
ro a “Presbyterian circuit-riding.” He ampaigning conducted many sacramental ser- 
vices and series of revival meetings, and was every- 
where greatly in demand for special occasions. He 
was a member of the Visiting Committee of the A. B. 
C. F. M. to its missions among the Cherokees. The 
early years of his pastorate at Maryville were years 
of very great usefulness. Surely his “dissatisfaction” 
at the limited amount of service he was able to render 
must now be diminishing or even disappearing. 
On the contrary, his holy discontent seemed to in- 
crease rather than to diminish. On every hand, as 
; he rode over the country, he wit- 
ae nessed the evidences of a deplor- 
able destitution, and his tender 
heart was torn with sorrow for the plight in which 
the young people of many a community found them- 
selves—without education or religious privileges, and 
31 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
  32 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
without intelligent leadership. Need, crying need, on 
every side, and not enough men to supply the tithe 
of the need! At the time of Isaac Anderson’s ordi- | 
nation there were only four ministers in all the broad 
bounds of Union Presbytery; and up to 1819 there 
were never sO many as nine ministers in attendance 
at a meeting of the presbytery. And the other denomi- 
nations represented in the field were little better 
manned. The destitution and the lack of men to re- 
move it rested like a pall upon the anxious heart of 
this apostle of the frontier. 
In 1812 he had helped organize the East Tennessee 
Missionary Society, whose object it was to send min- 
isters out on evangelistic tours throughout the more 
destitute parts of East Tennessee. An eloquent re- 
port of his as secretary in 1817 is still extant, and 
contains a fervid appeal to the young men of the 
section and of the land “beyond the mountains” to 
come to the help of the people in need. “Beautiful, 
indeed, upon any of the mountains that surround us 
will be the feet of them that bring good tidings, that 
publish peace and salvation, that say unto Zion, Thy 
God reigneth.” 
Horace Mann, who became famous a little later in 
Massachusetts as an apostle of education, was not 
more zealous for the spread of 
education than was this Isaac An- 
derson of East Tennessee; and 
John Knox of Reformation days was not more zeal- 
ous than was Isaac Anderson for the reform of in- 
dividual and national character. With the book of Zeal for Education 
and Character
-P-A-G-E-57
  DR. ANDERSON AND HIS SEMINARY 33 
human learning in one hand, and with that of divine 
wisdom in the other hand, he faced the manifest needs 
of his people, and labored incessantly both to teach 
them the true wisdom and to inculcate in them the 
genuine moral character of which they were so much 
in need. The high calling of a philanthropist-patriot 
was upon him. 
Leaders! leaders! leaders! They must be secured 
or East Tennessee and the entire Southwest would 
at be unled or misled. In a letter to 
Se crreawihip the Knoxville Register he said: 
“What, then, is the object of this 
essay? It is to call the attention of the public to 
consider the importance and necessity of providing 
a competent supply of learned and pious teachers and 
ministers, by some well-devised plan, supported by the 
free-will offerings of the people. The best interests 
of the public loudly demand this. We need them to 
teach the young and rising generation, to refine the 
public taste, to pour the light of science into our rising 
academies and colleges, and to impart to us the les- 
sons of heavenly wisdom from the sacred desk. I 
plead for no particular denomination—all denomina- 
tions of Christians hold the essential doctrines of 
Christianity. I plead for a learned and pious ministry 
to bless and adorn our rising country.” Since the 
harvest fields were ripe, it was the highest wisdom to 
prepare reapers for the fields. Let there be men to 
lead in the harvest! 
This was the Harvard anxiety and the Harvard 
statesmanship exhibited once more, this time down
-P-A-G-E-58
  34 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
amid the East Tennessee mountains. Cotton Mather 
said when speaking of “the Christians in the most 
early times of New England,” and 
Poles denia of their plan to found a college: 
“They foresaw that without such a 
provision for a sufficient ministry the churches of New 
England must have been less than a business of one 
age, and soon have come to nothing; the other hemi- 
sphere of the world would never have sent us over men 
enough to have answered our necessities; but with- 
out a nursery for such men among ourselves darkness 
must have soon covered the land, and gross darkness 
the people. For some little while, indeed, there were 
very hopeful effects of the pains taken by certain par- 
ticular men of great worth and skill, to bring up some 
in their own private families, for public services; 
but much of uncertainty and of inconvenience in this 
way was in that little while discovered. . . . They 
soon determined it that set-schools are so necessary 
there is no doing without them. Wherefore a Col- 
lege must now be thought upon: a College, the best 
thing that ever New England thought upon!” 
Dr. Anderson, however, found warrant far back of 
Harvard for his zeal for an educated leadership. In 
his inaugural address he based his 
remarks on these self-explanatory 
words from Hosea and Malachi: 
“My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge; be- 
cause thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject 
thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me. For the 
priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should The Prophets’

seek the law at his mouth; for he is the messenger 
of the Lord of hosts.” 
The problem, then, was how to secure these edu- 
cated leaders. He set about the most serious con- 
sideration of the problem. It 
ed steed gig surely was capable of some so- 
Leaders? lution. And manifestly it could 
not be ignored; and a serious- 
minded patriot could not dismiss it by passing it along 
to his next neighbor. The problem was his and the 
Southwest’s, and it called for solution, or for a sword 
to cut its Gordian entanglements. Given the need; 
wanted, to find the supply of that need. 
All that one man could do was to do his best. He 
could raise himself to the n-th degree, but it would 
be only himself, after all. Dr. An- 
derson, in his intense love for his 
people and in his anxiety for their 
development in education and character, wished and 
tried to multiply his integer self; but he found that, 
after all, he could be but one worker. The opportuni- 
ties of educational and evangelistic work and the im- 
portunities of schoolless and churchless communities, 
when viewed in connection with the heart-breaking 
limitations of time and physical strength and nerve 
endurance, almost drove him to despair. So many 
men’s work to be done, and yet he could not multiply 
himself! There was only one of him; and his power 
was only limited one-man power. 
Dr. Anderson and a few other ministers of East 
Tennessee, as we have seen, had been educating all Self-Multiplication 
Impossible
-P-A-G-E-62
  36 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
the teachers and ministers that they could, in their own 
homes. And yet the supply of these leaders was ut- 
terly inadequate. As Dr. Anderson 
was casting about for some way to 
remove this dearth of educated 
leaders, he received a visit, in 1817, 
from an ardent young minister, Rev. Eli Smith, pas- 
tor of a church in Frankfort, Kentucky, who was then 
on his way to visit his old home in Hollis, New Hamp- 
shire. : 
Mr. Smith listened to Dr. Anderson’s pathetic plaint 
over the lack of ministers, and then told the doctor 
about the great revivals that had visited New England. 
As they talked the whole matter over, the suggestion 
came from Dr. Anderson that Mr. Smith should dur- 
ing his visit down East attempt to persuade at least 
six young men to come to East Tennessee, to be 
trained here for their future ministry in the South- 
west—two in Dr. Anderson’s home, two in Dr. Har- 
din’s, and two in Dr. Coffin’s. 
Mr. Smith agreed to make the effort. Upon his 
arrival at his old home, his fervid appeals to the 
youth of Hollis set the whole town in a blaze, and 
several young men volunteered to go to Tennessee 
as students. But the terrors of the eleven hundred 
miles’ journey into the Southern wilderness fright- 
ened all the candidates but one to such an extent that 
they decided to stay at home. 
The lad Eli N. Sawtell could not be frightened. 
With all his worldly goods tied up in a cotton hand- 
kerchief, and with his hickory cane in his hand and Education of 
Imported Students 
Impossible 
 
-P-A-G-E-63
DR. ANDERSON AND HIS SEMINARY 37 
fourteen and a half dollars in his pocket, on May 
9, 1818, he set out for a land he knew not of. He 
was nearly two months on the way, and yet kind 
friends swelled his store of money until it was ten 
times as much as when he started. Fifty years later 
he wrote: “Dr. Anderson received me, and treated 
me ever as a son.” Dr. Anderson said of him: “God 
conveyed him, as on eagles’ wings, to a strange land, 
to devote himself to the cause of the Lord Jesus.” 
Seven years later, after having received a thorough 
education, young Sawtell was ordained to the minis- 
try. He became one of the most successful of the 
early agents of the Seminary; and was always a very 
useful man, laboring for many years in Kentucky, and 
then for some time serving as Chaplain to American 
seamen in Havre, France. 
Since only one student for the ministry in the South- 
west was secured by so favorable a trial of the plan 
: for importing students to be edu- 
Importation of cated in East Tennessee, it was Educated . Impossible evident that the plan was inade- 
quate to meet the necessities of the 
case. So Dr. Anderson gave his attention to an at- 
tempt to persuade those already educated to come to 
East Tennessee to take part in the ministry so much 
needed by the people. He first appealed to what home 
missionary societies then existed, but he received from 
them nothing more tangible than sympathy. 
The next year, 1819, Dr. Anderson was a commis- 
sioner to the General Assembly of the Presbyterian 
Church for the only time in his life. The Assembly 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
38 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
met that year in Philadelphia. In the mission society 
rooms in Philadelphia and in New York he used every 
effort to induce ministers to come to Tennessee to 
help do the work that called for the doing. But he 
failed to secure any volunteers. 
Then he turned his horse’s head toward Prince- 
ton, where the first Presbyterian theological seminary 
had been organized seven years before. Here at his 
hotel he held an interview with a number of the stu- 
dents and begged them to go to East Tennessee to 
help in the Lord’s harvest fields. He depicted to them 
the destitution and challenged their assistance. But 
Tennessee was at the ends of the earth in those days, 
and the fields nearer home had a prior claim upon 
them and insisted upon that claim. 
The call to the foreign field nowadays does not usu- 
ally demand so great sacrifices as did life on the wild 
and dubious Southwest frontier a century ago. All that 
Dr. Anderson attempted during this trip resulted in 
failure—he did not secure even one recruit for the work 
he loved. And as, in despondent mood, he turned his 
horse’s head homeward, the fire burned in his heart. 
Dr. Anderson was an able logician, surpassing 
most men in this respect.. He was acquainted with 
both the trilemma and the method 
Then Necessary of residues. He worked out the to Educate ; ‘ ; : Local Students problem in logic during his long 
horseback journey southward: 
since it had been proved that it was impossible to 
import students to be educated on the field, and equally 
impossible to import men who had been educated
-P-A-G-E-65
a 
DR. ANDERSON AND HIS SEMINARY = 39 
elsewhere, it followed that the only course left was 
to educate local students on the field and for the 
field. 
Sore of heart but clear of head, he talked the 
whole matter over day after day with Rev. James Gal- 
laher, his companion in the long journey back to the 
Southwest. During that homeward journey, the in- 
stitution of which this volume treats was created. The 
thoughtful traveler determined that the methods of 
educating ministers on the field had thus far been 
on too small a scale; and that it was now necessary 
that the Synod of Tennessee should establish for itself 
a seminary to do a work for the Southwest as nearly 
similar to that done at Princeton as possible. ‘As 
the address to the public in behalf of the proposed 
Southern and Western Seminary a few weeks later 
expressed it: “The seminaries of Andover and 
Princeton, while they display the public spirit, the 
ardor and strength of piety in a portion of our coun- 
try, will not be able, for centuries to come, to supply 
with ministers the vast uncultivated regions of the 
South and West.” 
Well did he realize that in order that such a school 
should be founded and be successful, some one must 
. devote himself to its service with 
fe eee as whole-souled devotion as char- 
acterized the patriotic soldier on 
the battle-field or the Christian martyr amid his en- 
emies. He had learned from his Lord the supreme 
lesson of unselfishness. Loving his neighbor as him- 
self, he thus fulfilled the law. If such self-devotion 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
40 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
was needed for the education and the evangelization 
of his people, he would devote the one man under 
his control—himself—to the task of founding and per- 
petuating the school. His life orientation was com- 
pleted as he rode along the leafy roads of Virginia 
and Tennessee. 
At the fall meeting of Union Presbytery following 
his return from the General Assembly, an overture 
to Synod drawn up by Isaac An- 
Pain Beckie derson was adopted by the pres- 
bytery in session at Dandridge, 
Tennessee, on October 8, 1819. The overture opened 
with the words: “The Presbytery viewing with deep 
concern the extensive fields of the Southern and 
Western parts of our country, already white to the 
harvest, in which there are few, very few, laborers; 
therefore, Resolved, That this Presbytery submit a 
plan to the Synod of Tennessee for a Southern and 
Western Theological Seminary, and do hereby recom- 
mend the adoption of it or some other plan by the 
Synod.” Then followed the detailed plan. 
In his inaugural address later on, Dr. Anderson said 
that the necessity and importance of such a theological 
seminary for the Western country had risen spontane- 
ously in the hearts of many individuals about the 
same time. Many of these individuals were members 
of Union Presbytery, and united with the author of 
the resolutions in unanimously adopting the overture 
to Synod. 
The Synod of Tennessee, very happily, met in Mary- 
ville the week following the meeting of Presbytery at
-P-A-G-E-67
  DR. ANDERSON AND HIS SEMINARY 41 
which the overture was adopted. Rev. John McCamp- 
bell, D.D., was chairman of the Committee on Bills 
and Overtures. Rev. James Galla- 
scale - the her, the comrade of the long horse- 
Bien back ride, was present as a corre- 
sponding member. On October 
14, the consideration of Overture No. 1 was begun. 
On the 19th the record says in the handwriting of 
Dr. Anderson, for he was then Clerk of the Synod 
of Tennessee and of the Presbytery of Union: “The 
Synod after maturely considering, revising, and 
amending the plans for a Southern and Western Theo- 
logical Seminary, agreed to adopt it, which is as fol- 
lows.” Then follows the constitution with its thirty- 
two articles. This was at the third annual meeting of 
the Synod of Tennessee, the enrollment being twenty- 
one, the largest attendance yet reached by the Synod. 
In 1819 the United States had a population only 
four and a half times the present population of the 
F State of Tennessee. Tennessee 
Bt Babies had only 422,000 inhabitants, or 
only ten to the square mile. There 
were then only forty-eight counties, while Blount 
County, about twice its present size, had only a little 
more than one-half its present population. Great 
Shelby County could boast a population of only 364. 
Maryville was a mountain hamlet containing a stone 
church, a log jail, and a cluster of log and frame 
houses, with here and there an exception in brick. 
Very ambitious, indeed, as coming from a partly 
reclaimed wilderness, does the constitution of the
-P-A-G-E-68
  42 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
Southern and Western Theological Seminary sound to 
us to-day. The plan was original and daring. Almost 
the only precedents to consult were seven-year-old 
Princeton Seminary, and eleven-year-old Andover 
Seminary. Dr. Anderson once said facetiously: 
“There is a feeling common to our race that the quali- 
fications of those who live west of us can not be of 
the first order.” But the villagers of East Tennessee 
were in earnest, and, braving the prejudice against 
them, in all seriousness invited the Synods of North 
Carolina, South Carolina, Kentucky, and Ohio—the 
younger sister of Tennessee—to cooperate with them in 
the establishment and maintenance of the new insti- 
tution. The Synod of Virginia had already—in 1812— 
established a theological school of its own, of which 
school Union Seminary, of Richmond, is the out- 
growth. 
When we take into account the fact that three of 
the presbyteries of the Synod of Tennessee were 
those of West Tennessee, Mississippi, and Missouri, 
some idea of the generous geographical dimensions 
that the field of the new institution was to include 
may be formed. Four hundred copies of a circular 
letter, containing the constitution and an address to 
the public, were published, one of which is preserved 
in the library of the Presbyterian Historical Society. 
The constitution as recorded in the Minutes of the 
Synod of Tennessee was very elaborate. Some of its 
provisions were as follows: The directors, thirty-six 
in number, were to be one-third Presbyterian laymen, 
and two-thirds Presbyterian ministers. They were to

do the work that is usually committed to directors and 
trustees. The professors were to be “ordained minis- 
ters of the Presbyterian church, 
not under thirty years of age, in 
good standing and of good report, 
men of talents, science, and learning.” They were 
to be chosen by the Synod, presbyteries, or individuals 
connected with the Seminary. 
The vacation months were April, one-half of Sep- 
tember, and October—two and a half months, instead 
of the four months now given by most theological 
seminaries. 
The course of study was to extend over three years, 
and to consist of the Greek Testament and the Hebrew 
Bible, Jewish Antiquities, Sacred Chronology, Biblical 
Criticism, Metaphysics, Didactic and Polemic Theol- 
ogy, Church History, Church Government, Composi- 
tion and Delivery of Sermons, and the Duties of the 
Pastoral Care. 
The Seminary was to be open to students of all 
denominations on equal terms. Only those that de- 
nied the common tenets of evangelical Christendom 
should have their privileges abridged. 
The high ideals that were held by the little com- 
pany of villagers and country preachers who framed 
this worthy instrument are manifest in its well-worked- 
out details and in its comprehensiveness. The consti- 
tution does credit to the enlightened zeal, benevolent 
purpose, and Christian faith of its authors. The

issued in behalf of the Seminary: “When we cast 
our eyes along the vista of time and eternity, we 
see, by the instrumentality of the Seminary, if made to 
succeed by the smile of heaven, the church increased, 
millions made happy on earth, heaven peopled with 
multitudes that no man can number; and the inhab- 
itants of both rising up to call its founders and patrons 
blessed.” 
In the roll of the thirty-six worthies that constituted 
the first directorate were James Gallaher, the redoubt- 
, able revivalist, and author of “The 
Tee De” Western Sketch Book” and “The Pilgrimage of Adam and David,” 
and Chaplain of the United States House of Repre- 
sentatives in 1852 and 1853; Charles Coffin, D.D., then 
president of Greeneville College, and, later, of East 
Tennessee College—now the University of Tennessee; 
Robert Hardin and William Eagleton, seven years 
later elected professors in the Seminary; John Mc- 
Campbell, cousin of Dr. Anderson and minister be- 
loved among the churches; Abel Pearson, the mille- 
narian author of “An Analysis of the Principles of 
the Divine Government”; Thomas H. Nelson, and the 
greater David Nelson, author of that classic of Chris- 
tian apologetics, “The Cause and Cure of Infidelity” ; 
Gideon Blackburn, D.D., once pastor at Maryville 
and apostle to the Indians, and, later on, founder of 
Blackburn University; Robert Henderson, D.D., the 
revered pastor of Hopewell Church, and author of 
two volumes of sermons; and James W. Stephenson, 
D.D., for forty-two years a pastor in Maury County.

The next act of Synod, however, was far more 
significant than were the actions already noticed. 
sie ae What was needed was not so much 
thirty-six directors as one director Was Duly : Chosen” who should indeed perform as well 
as direct the work. This is a la- 
conic record in the minutes of the Synod on October 
20, 1819: “Synod proceeded to the election of a pro- 
fessor of didactic and polemic theology. Upon count- 
ing the votes it appeared that the Rev. Isaac Anderson 
was duly chosen.” 
The records of the Synod of Tennessee are the chief 
source of the ante-bellum history of Maryville. The 
item just cited is the most important action regarding 
the institution recorded in those minutes. But for 
this action, all the mighty constitution and the resonant 
resolutions with their sounding Whereases and Re- 
solveds might have died away in the startled air as 
a mere brutum fulmen. When Isaac Anderson was 
balloted into the professorship, there was created a 
Southern and Western Theological Seminary, even 
though there was no endowment, no buildings, no li- 
brary, indeed, nothing except a constitution and some 
resolutions. In the momentous event of this election, 
dynamics were put into an inert plan; a great purpose 
now became incarnate. 
As we have seen, Dr. Anderson had been training 
individuals for the ministry. Now the Seminary 
would attempt this work on a 
larger scale. What if the Semi- 
nary be but Isaac Anderson “writ large”! Let the Genesis

work be done. Its Genesis has now been recorded. 
At some time in the fall of 1819, either before or 
after the meeting of Synod, it is uncertain which, 
Dr. Anderson began his work “in the little brown 
house, with a class of five students,” getting ready 
for his more advanced work soon to be initiated. 
The inaugural services connected with Dr. Ander- 
son’s formal induction into his chair of Didactic The- 
ology were postponed till 1822, when the new school 
had been gotten under way. The inaugural sermon 
was delivered by Rev. Robert Hardin; the address by 
Dr. Anderson; and the charge by Rev. John McCamp- 
bell. The three addresses were published, and the 
pamphlet is a historical document of priceless value.

  CHAPTER V 
Days OF CREATION 
THE hand of God is seen throughout the history of 
Maryville College, but especially is it manifest as 
it is laid upon Isaac Anderson con- 
secrating him to the work of col- 
lege creation. From the moment 
of his high commission, this mighty man of valor 
looms forth as an agent of Providence in bringing 
things to pass at Maryville. To every man who would 
accomplish something in the world God gives possible 
days of creation in which he has at once the duty 
and the opportunity of emulating his Lord, the great 
Creator. Dr. Anderson was appointed by Divine 
Providence and by his brethren of the Synod of Ten- 
nessee to no small creative work—to six periods of it. 
The first requisite of a school is a teacher. Other 
things—habitation, equipment, and the like—are con- 
venient ; but a teacher is indispens- 
) ? saat gs able. To equip the Southern and 
Western Theological Seminary 
with teachers was the first task required of Dr. An- 
derson; it was to be his first creative act. In view 
of the fact that there was no income or endowment, 
he decided that he would offer his own services, and

and His Agent 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
  48 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE — 
this without salary if need be. But one teacher alone 
would not be enough; three were needed. So, since 
no other teacher was available, he decided to do three 
men’s work, teaching, when necessary, as many as 
twelve hours a day. One of his pupils tells of his 
beginning his teaching before early breakfast, and con- 
tinuing it after supper. Thus he satisfactorily created 
a faculty! And, in addition to his triumvirate ser- 
vices, the older students also gave their services as 
tutors. The story as to how the faculty of one grew 
in size and numbers is told in another chapter. 
“And the evening and the morning were the first 
day.” 
Dr. ‘Anderson met many difficulties in enlisting 
young men to study for the ministry. There were 
so few preparatory schoois or col- 
®) bon leges that the young men that came 
to him were not prepared for 
higher vocational education. Then, too, most of them 
were too poor and too busy making a living to be able 
to spare the time for such a course of study. Dr. 
Anderson in a letter speaks of his students as being 
“poor and almost penniless, but pious young men.” 
East Tennessee at that time was a comparatively poor 
agricultural country, and trading was done principally 
by barter and not with money. | 
Opportune revivals of religion, gracious and re- 
peated, brought to Dr. ‘Anderson’s door a number of 
young men to be trained by him. They now had the 
will, and he helped mightily to provide the way. Sev- 
eral Indians were among the early students. The

DAYS OF CREATION 49 
founding of the Seminary was more effective in bring- 
ing students from a distance than the plan of private 
instruction for them had proved. Among the students 
from the North was John W. Beecher, the father of 
Professor Willis J. Beecher, of Auburn Theological 
Seminary. His diary tells of the coming of two or 
three young men from New Hampshire, who had been 
six weeks on the road, walking all the way; and of 
men from Pennsylvania who had walked from Balti- 
more. The young men from New Hampshire came 
from Hollis, and were led to do so by the addresses 
that Eli N. Sawtell delivered there upon returning for 
a visit after his eight years at Maryville. 
Dr. Anderson’s first class—one of the ablest, too, in 
the opinion of Dr. Craig—contained among others a 
shoemaker, a tailor, a blacksmith, and a farmer. Of 
this class, in 1825, there were licensed to preach Elijah 
M. Eagleton, Hilary Patrick, William Minnis, William 
A. McCampbell, and Eli N. Sawtell. 
And so the students gathered from different sec- 
tions and different peoples and represented different 
grades of culture and different antecedents; and in 
the democracy of the frontier and of a revived apos- 
tolic Christianity, under the magnetic leadership of 
their instructor, they were trained for the gospel min- 
istry. 
“And the evening and the morning were the sec- 
ond day.” 
A third necessity was a local habitation for the 
Seminary and its seminarists. Dr. Anderson was 
charged, also, with this task of providing homes for
-P-A-G-E-78
50 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
the students and a home for the school. The real 
shelter, however, was a man—Anderson—and not a 
mansion. As Dr. John S. Craig 
ee ten oo said of him: “Without a building 
and without a cent of money, in 
a little shanty of a house,” he began his work. He 
used his own house, and then “the shanty”—the “little 
brown house’—and erelong the “brick with six fire- 
places,” which seemed a palace to him and his boys. 
And, here, too, another chapter, “The Plant That Had 
to Serve,” will tell more in detail how this creator 
of a seminary made shift to keep his boys and his 
school sheltered from the weather. 
“And the evening and the morning were the third 
day.” 
The sturdy young men whom Dr. Anderson gath- 
ered around him from the farms and villages had 
healthy appetites and had to be fed. 
(4) Let There Be A. to drink, the problem was a Food and Raiment . simple one, for the school was 
from the beginning pledged to total abstinence from 
alcoholic drinks; and there are fifty gushing springs 
of pure water within a radius of two miles from Main 
Street; and some milk there was too, but no malt. 
But liquid nourishment was not enough. How to 
feed the hungry students was one of the most difficult 
problems before Dr. Anderson. The simplest way 
was the way he first adopted—to feed them himself 
so long as food should last. Said he: “Some of 
these young men boarded with me without charge; for 
the boarding of others of them I paid out of my own 
 
-P-A-G-E-79
~« 
a 
a. 
—~ 
DAYS OF CREATION 51 
pocket. When they were sick we took them to our 
own house and nursed them.” He used the produce 
of his own farm to feed them. 
In those early years such reports as these were fre- 
quent: “Twenty-eight out of thirty-five were sup- 
ported by charity”; “twenty-eight out of forty had 
free tuition, and eighteen had free board.” In 1827, 
out of forty-four students, forty-three had free tui- 
tion, and twenty-seven free board. 
The school had no rich friends. The Synod repre- 
sented a small and poor frontier church. That was 
before the day of large fortunes and of large gifts 
to education. The story of the boarding house and 
of the farm is told elsewhere. And though some- 
times the students were hungry, none of them ever 
starved. 
“And the evening and the morning were the fourth 
day.” 
The task of providing intellectual culture was, in- 
deed, a work of creation, for so imperfect were the 
school facilities of the frontier that 
ae gig Be there was comparatively little to 
Culture build upon in the way of intel- 
lectual training in the students 
that entered the Seminary. It was soon realized that 
most of the students needed literary training as pre- 
liminary to their theological training; so the literary 
department was almost immediately added to the plan 
of the institution. 
The worthy head of the school, with an almost 
incredible degree of industry, taught, as has been 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
  52 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
said, all day long and longer still, in his attempt to 
train the minds of his students for their high voca- 
tion as leaders of the people. The agents he em- 
ployed, especially Eli N. Sawtell, were successful in 
building up a very creditable library, numbering in 
the course of the years five thousand volumes, which 
contributed much to the culture of the students. And 
so stimulating was his leadership that he was success- 
ful in arousing his students to that most effective of all 
intellectual discipline—self-culture. Given such a 
teacher and such eager and industrious students, the 
natural result was a steady and gratifying advance in 
the culture of the young men. 
“And the evening and the morning were the fifth 
day.” 
The never-forgotten objective in Dr. Anderson’s 
life campaign was the development of Christian char- 
acter in the leaders whom he 
trained for the Southwest; in or- 
der that, in their turn, these lead- 
ers might, by precept reinforced by example, also be 
successful in developing that Christian character in 
the people whom, under the providence of God, they 
should some day have the responsibility and joy of 
leading. 
In this character objective the moral element was, 
of course, vital. The ethics of the Seminary must 
be of the very noblest and most elevating type known. 
Conscience must dominate and direct every act of 
the young men. The young theologues must in true (6) Let There Be 
Moral Character
-P-A-G-E-81
  DAYS OF CREATION 53 
and consistent living be “ensamples.” Of every one 
it should be possible to say: 
“That ferst he wroughte, and afterward he taughte;” 
for 
“If gold ruste, what shulde yren doo?” 
And so Isaac Anderson inculcated moral culture 
through his example. 
And in this character there must be superadded to 
the moral element the religious element. ‘So success- 
ful was he in implanting that characteristic in the 
very heart of the students and of the institution that 
it has ever since been part of the permanent riches of 
the school. And these moral and religious elements 
he had the good fortune to blend so intimately that 
they became in the traditions of the school both one 
and inseparable. 
“And the evening and the morning were the sixth 
day.”’ 
In those days of “do without,” a money endow- 
ment was out of the question; so let its place be taken 
by moral endowments—of more 
value than all the silver and gold 
of the nation. The Great Teacher 
had no material endowment, in 
the school of the apostles, but he carried with him the 
riches untold of his life of loving service for hu- 
manity. 
Dr. Anderson was not a money-raiser, though he To These Ends, a 
College 
Endowment 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
  54 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
was a master of men. He once told Rev. Thomas 
Brown, Maryville’s most successful agent in the ante- 
bellum period, that personally he would not have had 
the faith to raise as much as $6,000 in years. Dr. 
Robinson says of him: “He never asked a man for a 
single dollar.” 
But there were gifts of rich value that he could 
make, and so he gave toward the endowment of his 
seminary: (1) His life—thirty-eight rich years of it. 
Paul had said: “Wéithhold not yourselves.” And so 
this Pauline man endowed the school with the riches 
of his life. The Southern and Western Theological 
Seminary is his eloquent biography. (2) His love— 
the ardent and disinterested love for God and man, 
blessing all who came under the influence of the school. 
(3) His loyalty—keen and overmastering to such a de- 
gree that he so lost his own interests in those of 
the school that all his joys and sorrows were alike 
connected with the work of the institution. 
As he himself said, “the undying strength of this 
passion” for the work of the Seminary was “the cause 
of several effects: (a) When a minister has gone 
forth from this school of the prophets who has proved 
faithful to his Divine Master and his cause, I have 
enjoyed it exquisitely. (b) When any have gone into 
the harvest field and have proved lazy, inefficient 
drones, it has been like a cancer on my spirits. (c) 
When the faithful have been laid aside by sickness 
or death, my aching heart has bowed to the stroke 
without solace, except in the assurance that the Lord 
reigns, and that he loves his church infinitely more
-P-A-G-E-83
  DAYS OF CREATION 55 
than I can love it, and will take care of its best in- 
terests with infinite skill.” 
Surely such a life, such love, and such loyalty made 
an endowment of inestimable value.
-P-A-G-E-84
CHAPTER VI 
Days OF PROVIDENCE 
THE days of creation of which mention has been 
made were followed by days of providence in which 
the beginnings just described were 
continued and enlarged. Isaac An- 
derson determined that any young 
man ambitious to do good in the world should have 
the opportunity to prepare himself for Christian lead- 
ership in the Southwest; and so he established this 
“school of the prophets” for the benefit of all comers. 
The latch-string was always hanging out, and no fash- 
ionable door-knocker was needed. Those that would 
might enter. 
The institution, though founded by the Synod of 
Tennessee, was from its very foundation non-sec- 
tarian in both theory and practice. 
The poor of all denominations 
were encouraged to enter, and 
were helped impartially in the meeting of their ex- 
penses. The twenty-eighth article of the constitution 
of the Seminary is as follows: ‘Young men of any 
Christian denomination, of good moral and religious 
character, shall be admitted into the Seminary on the 
same principles, and shall be entitled to the same privi- 
56 An Education 
Provided for All 
Irrespective of 
Denomination
-P-A-G-E-85
  DAYS OF PROVIDENCE 57 
leges, as students of our own denomination.” When 
provision was made for the literary department in 
1821, it was stated by Synod to be for “such poor 
and pious youth of all Christian denominations as are 
seeking an education.” 
In his inaugural address, Dr. Anderson said: “This 
institution was founded with the most liberal views 
toward other Christian churches. It opens its doors 
to young men of all Christian denominations, and se- 
cures to them its privileges just to the extent they . 
may choose. From these liberal views and a prac- 
tice as liberal, it is hoped the institution will never 
depart. What can a generous public ask more at our 
hands?” The hope expressed by Dr. Anderson has 
been fully realized in the history of the institution. 
There has never been any sectarianism or proselytism 
at Maryville. 
The institution, as Dr. Craig says, was early known 
as “the poor man’s college.” In spite of the cruel 
limitations of his own resources, 
—— of Dr. Anderson extended a helping 
hand to as many as he could reach. 
The Seminary began without any endowment, income, 
or guarantee fund. The struggle for existence during 
the first few years was a desperate one. It would 
have disheartened a Faint Heart; but Anderson was 
a Great Heart. 
The students were waiting at the door. He said, 
“Give us this day our daily bread,” and then he shared 
the loaf with the students that also needed their daily 
bread. For example, in 1824, Dr. Anderson gave $449
-P-A-G-E-86
  58 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
in boarding and tuition, although he had not yet re- 
ceived any compensation for his services as professor. 
The next year he gave $607, and in 1826, $582. 
With the help of collections made by agents, Dr. 
Anderson in 1823-1824 purchased for $400 two small 
buildings and one and a half lots 
2 ding es adjoining the half lot on which the 
Seminary stood; and he then em- 
ployed a steward for a salary of $100 and the board 
of the steward and family. This was as purely a 
venture of faith as was any of George Miiller’s enter- 
prises. Some students paid part or all of their modest 
board bill, but not many did so. Where the $100 and 
the food for the boarding-house were to come from, its 
manager did not know. 
But the supplies came, sent by the Power that 
winged the ravens to Elijah, and wrought wonders in 
the widow’s cruse of oil and barrel of meal. But 
the boys did not fare sumptuously every day. “Some- 
times the students are supplied with the necessities, 
but rarely with the comforts of life; and sometimes 
are almost destitute of even the necessaries of life.” 
Among the occasional gifts gratefully acknowledged 
and reported to Synod were: Through Dr. Emmons 
of Massachusetts, $70; from Dr. Alexander McGhee, 
1,886 pounds of pork; from certain Maryville fam- 
ilies, free boarding of students; and from various 
churches, all kinds of farm products, including 172 
bushels of dried apples, fourteen shoulders and seven 
jaws, joints and middlings, flour, potatoes, and forty 
pounds of lard. And the boarding-house kept open
-P-A-G-E-87
  
  ; 
DAYS OF PROVIDENCE 59 
but did not keep out of debt. The entire debt of the 
school in 1827 was $1,005. The average cost of board 
at first was two dollars a month, or fifty cents a week, 
or seven cents a day! 
In 1826 the far-famed college farm of over 200 
acres was purchased for $2,500, and was paid for in 
part by money collected by Eli N. 
ene Sawtell. It was the farm on which 
South Maryville is now located, 
and lay between the Crooked Creek and Montvale 
roads, and extended from Pistol Creek to the neigh- 
borhood of the Broady farm. The manual-labor fea- 
ture was introduced, each student who received help 
being required to work on the farm a day, or, at least, 
half a day, a week. The products of the farm helped 
supply the boarding-house. The students set out a 
large orchard in 1827. Reuben L. Cates, father of 
Hon. Charles T. Cates, Sr., and John McCully, father 
of Isaac Anderson McCully, were among those that 
had charge of this farm for a while. 
This farm work did not interfere with the scholar- 
ship of the students, but rather improved it, benefited 
their health, and still further reduced the expense 
of living. In 1827 the Directors said: ‘The progress 
of the students is flattering, and not retarded by their 
occasional labors on the farm.” ‘The daughter of Rev. 
John W. Beecher writes: “As I read over my father’s 
diaries and see how much was expected of the young 
gentlemen who were students there, both as to physi- 
cal hard work and mental work as well, I do not 
wonder that Maryville has sent out many industrious, 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
    60 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
energetic, and exceedingly capable men. I am really 
astonished at what my father went through, earning 
his own way while keeping up his class work and 
passing good examinations.” 
It is not to be wondered at that the directors in- 
sisted that the expenses were lower than at any other 
; school on earth when we learn 
eat ar that before the boarding-house was 
established board was furnished at 
from twenty-five to thirty dollars a year; and that in 
the boarding-house it was reduced to about two dollars 
a month; and that the farm reduced it still further to 
about fifteen dollars a year; and that after the im- 
provement to the farm had been deducted, it was only 
about $9.09 a year, or less than a dollar a month, or 
three cents a day! Dr. Anderson announced that for 
every ten dollars in cash he would board a student 
for an entire year. Surely the Directors were justi- 
fied in saying: “There is no other institution where 
the benefactions of the liberal may be made more 
abundantly productive of good.” 
These statesmanlike methods of cooperative work 
resulted in comparative prosperity for the school. The 
students were healthy, industrious, 
appreciative, and reasonably con- 
tented, though sometimes on a 
short bill of fare. What they could not earn or bring 
from home Dr. Anderson and, later on, his helpers 
gave them or forgave them. And all went well for 
five years or more. 
In 1831 the Secretary of the Presbyterian Education Plain Living, 
High Thinking
-P-A-G-E-89
DAYS OF PROVIDENCE 61 
Society visited Maryville and urged that Dr. Ander- 
son, who had twice decided against such a policy, 
should allow his students to become the beneficiaries 
of the society. The offer of forty dollars or more a 
year was very tempting to the poor boys in their strug- 
gles and hard fare, and very naturally they sided with 
the kindly visitor. Finally, Dr. Anderson yielded the 
point, but against his best judgment. When the stu- 
dents found themselves in possession of a goodly 
amount of cash, they lost their love for the farm with 
its work, and for the boarding-house with its uncertain 
fare, and preferred to keep “bachelor’s hall” or to 
board in private families. Thus the prosperous man- 
ual-labor farm lost its prestige and popularity, and, 
finally, its very existence. 
However, the Seminary prospered for a while under 
the new policy, or under the two policies. In 1832, it 
was announced that one day’s work a week, together 
with $7.50, would pay a year’s board bill! The an- 
nouncement was also made that no one who had read 
languages from three to six months need turn away 
from the institution for lack of funds. The new 
order of things was not so picturesque nor so heroic, 
but it was a deal more comfortable. All that was 
needed to the continued prosperity of the Seminary 
was that the barrel should never give out. 
In 1836 the manual-labor feature was definitely 
abandoned, and the old boarding department went 
with it. A modified boarding-house was, however, 
established, where board could be obtained, at first for 
sixteen dollars a session, and later at twenty dollars
-P-A-G-E-90
62 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
a session. Mr. James Gillespie, of the class of 1849, 
said in his reminiscences: “I boarded one session at 
the boarding-house, and my recollection is that it cost 
me less than two dollars a month.” In 1838 
the Education Society, influenced it is to be sup- 
posed by the troubles that in that year disrupted 
the Presbyterian Church, ceased to assist the theologi- 
cal students at Maryville. This greatly embarrassed 
Dr. Anderson and his helpers, and ultimately hastened 
the practical suspension of the theological department. 
These days of providence that developed the school 
were crowded with the personality of Dr. Anderson. 
At first the only teacher, he was 
= om act always a _ schoolmaster indeed. 
Endowed with a commanding pres- 
ence, a winning personality, and inexhaustible tact, he 
won the affection of his students, and was to them 
the ideal teacher. Governor Reynolds, in his autobi- 
ography, speaks of “that noble dignity that seemed to 
be his birthright.” “Nature bestowed upon him great 
strength of mind.” 
Says Dr. Robinson: “He possessed the rare faculty 
of impressing himself on his pupils, while at the same 
time requiring no servile assent to his mere dictation. 
He could not brook such a thing. His constant aim 
was to make his students think and understand for 
themselves. . . . Every student was required to read, 
study, and write on the topics which he announced 
to them from time to time, as they progressed in the 
course. After they had done what they could in this 
way for themselves, he read to them the lectures which

he had prepared with great care.” He also carried 
his method of Socratic and catechetical teaching into 
his church work. “He prepared long lists of ques- 
tions and answers for the different quarters of his con- 
gregation on the Evidences of Christianity and the 
Inspiration of the Bible.” These were published in 
the village paper. Naturally, he welcomed the Sun- 
day school as an ally in his campaign of Christian 
education. As early as 1834 fourteen Sunday schools 
were conducted in different quarters of the great par- 
ish of New Providence Church of which he was 
pastor. 
His students appreciated and loved him. One of 
his first class said of him: “When I received my com- 
mission to ‘Go, preach the gospel,’ and was obliged to 
tear myself from him, it seemed that my very heart- 
strings were breaking.” 
It is not given to many persons to excel in different 
lines; but Dr. Anderson was as great a preacher as he 
was a teacher. He was a princely 
preacher, and commanded the rev- 
erence and admiration of all that 
had the good fortune to hear him. Dr. Robinson com- 
pares his eloquence to a “mighty rushing wind.” Of 
commanding presence, “his majestic form seemed, 
sometimes, to swell into almost gigantic proportions, 
as he poured forth a torrent of appeal.” “That which 
arrested the attention and excited the admiration of 
every beholder, was the remarkably sweet expression 
of his countenance, and the facile power of his eye. 
On the Sabbath, when he rose in the pulpit to com- A Princely

mence the service, the impress of a more heavenly 
serenity, a more placid benevolence, a calmer dignity, 
is seldom seen on human brow.” 
He was a thorough logician, but was also capable of 
the most impassioned earnestness, and so, naturally, 
he was a doubly impressive preacher, winning both the 
reason and the emotions of his audience. Dr. Allen, 
of Huntsville, Alabama, said of him: “I have been in 
Philadelphia, New York, and Boston, and have heard 
their greatest speakers; I have been in Liverpool, 
London, and Manchester, and have listened to the 
preaching of their most distinguished men; but that 
man is the greatest man I ever heard.” No wonder 
that the people were eager to hear him at sacramental 
meetings, presbyteries, and synods. He _ usually 
preached about two hundred sermons a year, besides 
carrying on all his other work. 
The Directors said of Dr. Anderson in 1833: “He is 
one who needs not to be ashamed. Invincible in argu- 
mentation and luminous in the exhibition of truth, 
he stands as a pillar of light in this dark valley of 
death.” 
The students found in their honored president not 
only a great teacher and preacher, but also a father 
and friend. His heart was large 
Blea ibed and his sympathies were overflow- 
ing. As in his congregation he had 
kind words and a shepherd’s tender care for every one 
of his flock in health and in sickness, so in his school 
he won every student by his unfeigned interest in him 
and by his fatherly regard for him.
-P-A-G-E-95
  DAYS OF PROVIDENCE 65 
Says Dr. Robinson: “ ‘He was a father to me’; 
this is the language they uniformly use when speaking 
of him. And this feeling of filial regard was the 
result of his kindness and sympathy, and the manifest 
interest which he felt in their happiness and pros- 
perity.” Said one of his earliest students: “I never 
looked upon him in any other light, nor did he ever 
exhibit any other feeling than that of the kindest and 
best of fathers.” 
Dr. Anderson’s wife, Fars, or as the inscription 
on her monument calls her, Florence McCampbell, was 
; a member of another strong, 
os Good Wife a sturdy, and substantial Scotch- other to Them : , Irish family that also settled in 
Rockbridge County, Virginia. She had a character 
that was worthy of her family and her husband. The 
marriage took place on October 19, 1802. 
Rev. G. S. White, in addressing the Alumni in 1857, 
said of her: “In spirit, in energy, in decision, in love 
to God, and devotion to his cause, there was in her 
natural and moral habits an entire adaptedness to 
encourage, advance, and sustain her noble husband 
in every good work and undertaking.” 
As her husband fathered the students, she mothered 
them. “Many a young man far from home, in a 
strange land, felt the power of her kind words, and 
the value of her kind attentions.” And she was a most 
loyal wife, toiling with all her strength to help her 
husband carry out his too ambitious plans of helpful- 
ness for the students. Dr. Anderson’s distress at her 
loss was pathetic in the extreme. 
 
-P-A-G-E-96
    66 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
“IT do remember her many virtues with gratitude to 
God. Prudent and discreet in her intercourse with 
society, respected by all, kind without ostentation, not 
letting the left hand know what the right hand did, 
firm and resolute in her purposes, prayerful, and a 
lover of God and of good men, the word of God 
dwelt in her richly, and she sought and loved the 
truth. How great is my debt of gratitude to God for 
such a wife!” 
The most beneficent and permanent contribution 
made to the institution of learning that he founded, 
= ‘ and through it to the world, has 
oe Maryville been what Maryville students have pirit” He j ; ; Created: long been in the habit of calling 
“the Maryville spirit.” To former 
Maryville students it has needed no definition, for they 
have seen it and felt it and believe in it. To outsiders, 
the uninitiated into the college mysteries, it is rather 
hard to define, but its outlines may be roughly indi- 
cated. 
Thanks to Dr. Anderson’s cosmopolitan sympathies, 
the school has always had a breadth of sympathy that 
has been a part of its animating 
“ Breadth of spirit. Said Dr. Robinson: “If uman Interest ; : there ever lived a man who illus- 
trated in his life the doctrines he taught from the 
pulpit and the professor’s chair, that man was Isaac 
Anderson. Love was the sum and substance of his 
teaching and his life. He had a heart large enough 
and loving enough to embrace within its benevolent 
desires all mankind. He had a broad philanthropy,
-P-A-G-E-97
  DAYS OF PROVIDENCE 67 
a hearty good-will to man, which led him to labor for 
the salvation of the humblest slave as well as for 
the proudest child of fortune. Any object of want or 
suffering never failed to move his sympathies and 
elicit his charitable benefactions. In his benevolence 
he was no respecter of persons. The African, the In- 
dian, the foreigner from whatever land, was to him 
as a brother, and as such he felt under obligation to 
promote, so far as he could, his temporal and eternal 
welfare.” 
The typical Maryville man is interested in whatever 
concerns humanity. He believes in home and foreign 
missions of every type; he is not sectional, but na- 
tional, and fits in well in the South, North, East, or 
West. And this is the spirit that has prevailed ever 
since the beginning, because Dr. Anderson embodied 
it and taught the students to embody it. A priceless 
boon was this great contribution to the institution. 
It was one of the many strong points in the char- 
acter of the founder of Maryville College that he was 
himself by nature and training a 
representative of thoroughgoing 
scholarship, and by instinct and 
practice as a pedagogue entirely unable and unwilling to 
be content with anything but the most painstaking and 
accurate work on the part of his students. In his 
classes in theology he employed a system that was so 
scholarly and thorough that it commanded the respect 
of his students even after they had pursued their 
studies further in the best institutions in the land. 
His condensed text-book in didactic theology was (2) Thorough 
Scholarship 
 
-P-A-G-E-98
  68 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
printed in Maryville, in 1833, and contains 112 pages 
of questions and answers and outlines. The three 
years’ course of theology as taught in the Seminary 
is here carefully outlined. The plan of instruction is 
described as follows: “The class have the subject 
given to them, as, for example, Natural Theology. 
They are then directed to read such and such authors ; 
if the subject is a controverted one, they read on both 
sides. After they have done reading they then hear 
a lecture from the Professor, and are required to 
write an essay on the same subject, and then read it 
before the Professor for remarks. Afterwards the 
class are examined, according to the preceding ques- 
tions, and such as the Professor may think proper.” 
An acute reasoner, he aroused his students to clear 
and logical thinking; and did much more than that— 
for he infused into the college spirit that quality of 
thorough scholarship, which has never departed from 
the College, its faculty, and its student body. 
The kind of religion that Isaac Anderson believed 
in and exemplified had nothing weak or cowardly or 
invertebrate or uncertain about it. 
oe It was, on the contrary, strong and 
brave and _ positive. Thomas 
Hughes had not yet written about the “Manliness of 
Christ”; but Christ had lived his manliness ; and Isaac 
Anderson, Christ’s disciple, had walked with him, 
and had learned to be one of the modern Boanerges. 
“The Maryville spirit” has, from the days of An- 
derson, had as one of its distinctive elements what 
may well be called “manly religion.” Anderson made
-P-A-G-E-99
DAYS OF PROVIDENCE 69 
his students feel that religion calls out the highest and 
noblest qualities of one’s nature and elicits and enlists 
the heroic and godlike ina man. And throughout the 
century the men of Maryville have become Christians 
in order to attain the highest and richest possibilities of 
their manhood; not in order to “be saved” in any 
small and selfish sense, but in order to be saviors of 
men “on the largest possible scale.” Not cant nor 
cowardice, but sincerity and courage send men out 
into the field to battle for the right. 
If a man has entered into the spirit of things at 
Maryville, and has allowed “the Maryville spirit” to 
enter into him, he has, then, 
oo breadth of human interest, the love 
of thorough scholarship, and the 
practice of manly religion. But he also has, if true 
to the teachings of his College, a spirit of unselfish 
service that impels him forth to help and bless his 
neighbor. He appreciates life as an opportunity for 
usefulness. He looks upon himself as his brother’s 
keeper. The Maryville student that hides his talent in 
a napkin does sad discredit to the spirit that his alma 
mater inculcates. The College has practised self- 
denial for the benefit of its students to such a remark- 
able degree that the students that are responsive to the 
call of the worthy have become imbued with the 
prevalent college spirit and have in turn tried to pass 
on to others the benefit that they themselves have 
received. 
And this unselfish service was rendered on the part 
of Dr. Anderson without any egotism or bluster or 
 
-P-A-G-E-100
  70 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
attempt at notoriety. Said Rev. G. S. White: “In no 
other instance have I ever seen modesty connected 
with great and glorious plans, so retiring and so 
speechless as was his.” 
In these years that we have termed “Days of Provi- 
dence,” the College, in spite of manifold limitations 
and hindrances, succeeded in pro- 
; Worthy viding for the world and its needs utput a most worthy threefold output: 
(1) “The Maryville spirit,” which has just been ana- 
lyzed and described, was in itself a very worthy con- 
tribution to the world. To possess many leaders of 
the Southwest with such a spirit had a significance 
in good done that can not be overestimated. 
(2) The Maryville men who were speedily sent out 
to serve as leaders in their section of the country were 
an invaluable contribution to the community at large. 
By 1826 it could be said: “Already twelve young men 
have been sent out to preach the everlasting gospel.” 
Three years later the directors report forty-one min- 
isters representing three denominations, as already at 
work among the churches, In 1833 the directors write 
that “nearly sixty have gone out to preach.” In 1840, 
they say that “fourscore” have entered the ministry ; 
while four years later Dr. Anderson himself says that 
the institution has sent out “nearly a hundred,” who 
in turn had “gathered hundreds and hundreds into the 
fold of the Good Shepherd.” 
In 1840 it was said that without the Seminary, “for 
aught that we can see, East Tennessee would be with- 
out a Synod and comparatively without a ministry.”
-P-A-G-E-101
DAYS OF PROVIDENCE 71 
From 1825, when his first class was licensed, to 1852, 
Dr. Anderson assisted in the licensure of seventy- 
seven young men, and in the ordination of sixty-six 
licentiates, in Union Presbytery alone. His students 
were ordained by other presbyteries and other denom- 
inations in considerable numbers. At the spring meet- 
ing of Union Presbytery in 1844 Dr. Anderson 
preached a sermon on II Timothy ii: 15, to the minis- 
ters that had studied theology under him. And they 
were a rare body of manly men. 
(3) The vast amount of worthy work that was done 
in the Southwest through the agency of the men of 
Maryville was another valuable contribution to the 
world. What the directors hoped for in 1825, as their 
report to Synod by Charles Coffin, Chairman, and 
William Eagleton, Clerk, indicated, was, during these 
“days of providence,” fully realized: “It is hoped and 
believed that hundreds will issue from this fountain 
of science and piety who will spread a benign and 
salutary influence in the community on the temporal 
and eternal destinies of millions of mankind.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
  CHAPTER VII 
THE TEACHERS THAT SERVED 
For several years after the founding of the insti- 
tution, Dr. Anderson did all the teaching that was 
done in the theological department, 
te tag and “extended his tuition to stu- 
dents in literature in its various 
branches.” He was aided by the young theologues 
in his work in the department that was from the first 
inevitable, and that came to be called “the Literary 
Department.” 
During this period it was that he often worked 
twelve hours a day in the classroom. And yet he was 
pastor of New Providence Church, of Maryville, and 
the Second Church, of Knoxville, and bore all the re- 
sponsibilities of these churches in addition to his 
school work. In 1827 New Providence Church ranked 
thirteenth in size among the Presbyterian churches 
in the United States; its membership numbered 467, 
and a few years later reached a total of 700. No 
wonder that the strain of so much work should have 
been almost unendurable. 
As early as 1821 Synod amended the constitution 
of the Seminary to provide for a tutor in “the requisite 
72
-P-A-G-E-103
  THE TEACHERS THAT SERVED 73 
literature” for those who were not far enough 
instructed to enter upon the study of theology. 
In 1824 it was reported: “The 
divinity students have gener- 
ously given their assistance, when 
necessary, to the instruction of those who are pur- 
suing a course of education in the institution.” 
The work, however, was too great for one man 
and student assistants. The Directors said in 1826: 
“After a course of nearly six years’ experience, we 
are fully convinced that it is utterly impossible for 
one man to attend to the arduous and various duties 
of the Seminary. It is a pressure which neither the 
body nor the mind of any man can long sustain... . 
The responsible care of two congregations, added to 
the superintendency and charge of the boarding-house, 
and the instruction of a large school in the different 
branches of literature and theology, is enough to bring 
any constitution, even the most elastic and durable, 
to a premature grave. But by the appointment of 
additional instructors this difficulty, otherwise insur- 
mountable, may be easily obviated.” 
In view of this condition of affairs, the Synod 
voted to proceed immediately to the election of two 
professors. Rev. William Eagle- 
ton had been appointed “Instructor 
in Languages and Sciences” in 
1825, and had begun to serve in the spring of 1826. 
Now, in the fall of 1826, Synod elected him as “Pro- 
fessor of Sacred Literature,” and Rev. Robert Hardin 
as “Professor of Ecclesiastical History and Church Then Student 
Assistants 
Then One or Two 
Colleagues
-P-A-G-E-104
  »4 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
Government.” In 1827 it was reported to Synod 
that Mr. Hardin had accepted the appointment; but 
he served in the field as an agent rather than as a 
professor in the classroom. The “two professors” re- 
ferred to in the eighth report (1827) were doubtless 
Dr. Anderson and Rev. William Eagleton. Dr. Eagle- 
ton had been educated under Dr. Anderson before the 
Seminary was founded. Dr. Craig says of him: “He 
was a rather brilliant orator, a clear and cogent rea- 
soner, and of rather captivating eloquence. While 
he was on a visit to Maryville in 1833 or 1834, I heard 
him preach several times, and the people were much 
delighted with him—a thing much to his credit before 
and with a congregation such as Dr. Anderson’s was 
at that day. Dr. Eagleton built up a large, stable, 
and flourishing church at Murfreesboro.” 
From 1831 onward there were usually three pro- 
fessors in the faculty. In the report for 1840 it is 
stated: “Hitherto the labor of in- 
Usually a struction both in literature and the- Triumvirate ology has fallen on three profes- 
sors, and has been sustained by much self-denial and 
sacrifice. The duties of their office have demanded 
all their time, almost without a moment for relaxa- 
tion or for enlarging the circle of their own knowl- 
edge.” And then there followed an appeal for at 
least one more professor. A small number of pro- 
fessors, it is true, but the old colleges, such as Har- 
vard, Yale, and Princeton, had their long periods of 
history in which they, too, were served by not more 
than three professors.
-P-A-G-E-105
  THE TEACHERS THAT SERVED 75 
Professor Eagleton was dismissed from Union Pres- 
bytery to Shiloh Presbytery in 1829, and probably left 
, the College in that year. In 1829 
ayers Hert Rev. Darius Hoyt was elected Pro- 
fessor of Languages, and served until his death, which 
occurred on August 16, 1837. He was a son of the 
famous Rev. Ard Hoyt, who came from Connecticut 
to Georgia to be a missionary to the Cherokees. He 
was educated at Maryville, and was licensed to preach 
in 1827. He served as tutor in the Seminary until 
he was elected a professor. 
Says Dr. Craig: “Mr. Hoyt was a good linguist, a 
shrewd critic; of a very mild, quiet, inoffensive spirit, 
and of a remarkably amiable disposition.” He loved 
the students and they loved him. He established The 
Maryville Intelligencer, to be a weekly religious news- 
paper. In its columns he did his utmost to further 
every good cause. Of a very sympathetic disposition, 
he was the warm friend of the Indian and the slave. 
He was a leader in the temperance reform. A man 
of great tact and personal influence, his premature 
loss by death, when only thirty-three years of age, 
was greatly lamented, the Seminary building being 
“shrouded in mourning.” The Directors said of him: 
“His devotion to the cause of education and to the 
interests of the church has hardly been surpassed.” 
Judge J. G. Wallace said of him: “He was one of 
the most amiable characters I ever knew. Everybody 
loved him and he loved everybody.” Professor Hoyt’s 
grandchildren recently placed an appropriate granite
-P-A-G-E-106

monument on his grave in the New Providence ceme- 
tery. 
The first “literary” professor was Rev. Samuel Mac- 
Cracken, one of whose nephews is ex-Chancellor Mac- 
Cracken of the New York Univer- 
sity. Mr. MacCracken was elected 
Professor of Natural Science in 1831, and was greatly 
respected as a man and as a teacher, He was a mem- 
ber of the United Presbyterian Church, and resigned 
the following year in order to take up work in his 
own church. 
In October, 1832, Rev. Fielding Pope, at the time 
pastor of a church in Athens, Tennessee, was elected 
as Professor MacCracken’s successor, to serve as Pro- 
fessor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy; but 
he did not begin teaching until May, 1833. He was 
a polished and courtly Kentucky-bred gentleman of 
impressive appearance, and represented the Cavalier 
type as decidedly as Professor Craig represented the 
Covenanter type. 
Professor Pope was an alumnus of Maryville. In 
his education in Kentucky he had secured a good 
knowledge of mathematics and of some of the sci- 
ences. He was married before he felt called to the 
ministry, and he brought his wife with him to Mary- 
ville. Here he studied the languages and theology. 
In 1827 he was licensed to preach, and the following 
year he was ordained to the ministry. 
Mr. Pope served for seventeen hard-working years 
as a professor in the literary or college department of 
the institution. As a teacher he was much beloved Fielding Pope
-P-A-G-E-107
   THE TEACHERS THAT SERVED 77 
by his students. In 1850, for the lack of adequate 
financial support, he resigned his chair, and became 
Principal of the Maryville Female Institute. The In- 
stitute building stood on Main Street, just east of 
the old New Providence Church. While teaching, 
Mr. Pope was also pastor of Eusebia Church. In 
1856 he was installed as Dr. Anderson’s successor in 
the pastorate of New Providence Church, where he 
served until 1865. He died near Lumpkin, Georgia, 
on March 23, 1867. 
On September 3, 1840, Rev. John Sawyers Craig 
was elected Professor of Languages to succeed Pro- 
; fessor Hoyt. He had already 
eee, eee. served as a tutor in the College 
from August, 1837, to 1840, being appointed tutor 
immediately after the death of Professor Hoyt. He 
was born in a log cabin in Knox County, Tennessee, 
and was educated at Maryville, entering in 1832, and 
graduating, probably in 1836. 
In personal appearance Mr. Craig was a little more 
than medium in height, of a red complexion, with 
sandy hair, and gray eyes. When he reached Mary- 
ville to enter college he was dressed in a suit of home- 
made and home-dyed blue cotton, and carried all his 
earthly belongings tied up in a red bandanna handker- 
chief. So unprepossessing and so wunpromising a 
student did he appear, that, if the traditions are true, 
Professor Pope decided to hurry him home by as- 
signing to him lessons of excessive length; while the 
students decided to assist his departure by such means 
as were within their power. To the amazement of
-P-A-G-E-108
  »8 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
Professor Pope, the lad gave him perfect recitations 
and seemed greedy for more; while the students soon 
found that “yellow head” was abundantly able to take 
care of himself. And so John Craig won his stand- 
ing in a college of which he was to become one of 
its most brilliant graduates and professors. 
Dr. Craig was a stern, inflexible, rugged, blunt, bril- 
liant, and kind-hearted, and even  tender-hearted 
genius, and was one of Maryville’s ablest men. He 
was a profound scholar in all lines of college studies. 
His memory was so retentive that he conducted his 
recitations in the classics without the help of a text- 
book. Capable of an almost unlimited amount of work, 
he filled his twenty-one years of service with very 
arduous toil, and bore his full share of the cares and 
responsibilities of the College. At one time, soon after 
the breakdown of Dr. Anderson, he was the only pro- 
fessor left in the institution. He stood by the Col- 
lege in its weakness and poverty. 
Dr. Craig was a man of deep thought, broad mind, 
strong character, firm convictions, and martyr spirit. 
He lived in troublous times that tried men’s souls, 
but was a brave and conscientious man throughout 
all those trying years. He was more noted for being 
fortiter in re than suaviter in modo; but no one ever 
doubted his sincerity. In complete sympathy with 
the purposes of the College, himself the product of 
the institution into which he entered as raw material, 
he spared himself not at all in his self-denying effort 
to make Maryville serve efficiently its student body.

  THE TEACHERS THAT SERVED 79 
From 1861 until his death, which occurred on April 
4, 1893, he served in the ministry in Indiana. 
Rev. John J. Robinson, D.D., was born in 1822, in 
Georgia, the son of Col. Joseph W. Robinson, a mem- 
ber of the State legislature. He 
spa DD graduated from the University of 
ine Tennessee, at the head of his class, 
in 1845, and from Union Theological Seminary, New 
York, in 1849. He was elected Professor of Sacred 
Literature in 1850, and served until 1855, when he 
resigned to go to Kentucky. A man of “energetic 
mind and urbane manners,” he helped the College in 
a time of great depression. One of his colleagues 
called him “a fine scholar, able theologian, eloquent 
preacher, and thorough instructor.” One of his stu- 
dents says of him: “He was a refined, cultured, and 
scholarly man.” Maryville owes him a great debt 
of gratitude for his labor of love, the “Memoir of Dr. 
Isaac Anderson, D.D.,” an octavo volume of 300 pages, 
published in Knoxville in 1860. 
In 1844 there appeared at Maryville a new student, 
who in future days was to be the refounder of the Col- 
lege. Lamar was a modest, quiet, 
a Jefferson alert, observing, and _ persistent 
eighteen-year-old lad; and in due 
time came to be recognized as one of the strongest 
of the students. Mr. James Gillespie tells of reciting 
Vattel’s Law of Nations to Mr. Lamar, who was then 
a Senior. After graduating in 1848 from the college 
department, he studied theology under Dr. Anderson 
for a year; and then in 1849 he went to Union Theo- 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
80 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
logical Seminary and took a regular three years’ 
course, graduating in 1852. After four years of work 
done in Missouri he was, on September 27, 1856, 
elected successor to Rev. John J. Robinson, as Pro- 
fessor of Sacred Literature. Synod appointed Elder 
Daniel Meek, who had helped Mr. Lamar meet his 
college expenses, chairman of a committee to inform 
Mr. Lamar of his election to the professorship, and 
to urge upon him to accept the appointment and to 
enter at the earliest practicable period upon the duties 
of the professorship. He entered upon his work at 
the College the following year; and from that time to 
his death he gave his heart and life to the upbuilding 
of the institution. 
During the last ten or twelve years of his life Dr. 
Anderson was partially disabled by the paralysis of 
one of the nerves of the lumbar 
Dr. Anderson plexus, and had to remain seated Rests from trial Taher’ while preaching and teaching. The 
last two or three years he used a 
crutch in walking. More serious, however, was the 
mental weakening that also came upon him during the 
last two or three years of his life. He was nearing 
seventy-five years of age when the collapse of his 
powers became so pronounced that he was forced to 
give up most of his work. The only wonder is that 
such excessive labors as he expended during a long 
life did not earlier occasion this disability. For fifty 
years he toiled as very few men ever toiled. 
Ten months before his death his residence, with all 
 
-P-A-G-E-113
    THE TEACHERS THAT SERVED 81 
its contents, including his library and his priceless 
manuscripts and correspondence, was consumed by 
fire. It was with difficulty that he himself was saved. 
The shock doubtless hastened his death. One can easily 
imagine the pathos of the only thing he said as they 
bore him from the flames: “My library is burned up.” 
Two of his students, John Beaman Minnis and Isaac 
Nelson Caldwell, carried him in a chair to a neigh- 
bor’s house. It was a strange coincidence that the 
library of the second president, Dr. Robinson, was 
also consumed by fire in his old age. Invaluable his- 
torical records were destroyed in both these fires. 
After the fire Dr. Anderson was tenderly cared for 
by his daughter-in-law, who was now the wife of one 
of Dr. Anderson’s former students, Rev. John M. Cald- 
well, at her home in Rockford, six miles north of 
Maryville. Here the founder of the College fell 
asleep on the morning of January 28, 1857. He was 
buried in the New Providence cemetery, at the side 
of his wife and son. The old stone church, before its 
removal, extended over the place where he now lies 
buried. His body lies almost at the very spot where in 
1822 stood the pulpit from which he delivered his in- 
augural address as the first president of what is now 
Maryville College. 
“T heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, 
Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord 
from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they 
may rest from their labors; and their works do follow 
them.”

ture, as his successor in the presidency. Dr. Robinson 
entered upon his work as President at the opening of 
the summer session, April 7, 1857. His administration 
covered the four troublous years 
immediately preceding the Civil 
War, and yet substantial progress 
was made, opposition died down, 
and the attendance increased by 1861 to its maximum 
—over one hundred—in ante-bellum times. They came 
from most of the States of the Southern and Western 
group. 
Scholarly, energetic, and possessing good executive 
ability, he was laying foundations for better days. 
He revised and improved the curriculum and raised 
the standards of scholarship. Dr. Robinson was a 
good speaker. Those who remember him speak of 
his voice as being peculiarly moving and melodious. 
Captain W. H. Henry said of him: “Henry Ward 
Beecher, as I heard him, did not seem a more elo- 
quent speaker than Dr. Robinson.” During the War 
Dr. Robinson served as chaplain in the Confederate 
army, and after the War he served churches in Ala- 
bama and Georgia. He died in Atlanta, on November 
8, 1894. 
The writer of this volume has had the privilege 
of reading some of Dr. Robinson’s private correspond- 
ence, and has been deeply impressed by the evidences 
there given of his kindly courtesy, transparent sin- 
cerity, genuine honor, and sterling Christian conscien- 
tiousness. He was one of the most worthy builders 
of Maryville. Dr. Robinson,

It seems incredible that so few men as have been 
enumerated in this chapter should have been able 
to accomplish so large a work as 
was done by Maryville during the 
forty-two years that elapsed from 
1819 to 1861. Nothing but a high altruistic purpose 
and indefatigable industry could have achieved such 
large service. It was not a “forlorn hope,” the en- 
terprise in which they were engaged; but they exem- 
plified all the heroism which is usually associated with 
those who volunteer for such a desperate service. The 
College is proud of their self-denying toil and worthy 
achievements, and prays that its present faculty may 
have a double portion of their spirit. Few Professors

  CHAPTER VIII 
THE FRIENDS THAT HELPED 
THE pages of this book are intended to recount 
what may be called the genesis and the exodus of 
: : Maryville—its genesis into being 
soe Without = and its exodus from its early limi- 
tations. In the days of its genesis 
and its long-time bondage no one need be surprised 
to hear of heavy burdens, when bricks had to be made 
without straw. The chapter, “Days of Creation,” has 
told of some of those sad and weary times. Of friends 
to help there were but few; but some friends there 
were, or the story of the College would be even more 
grim and serious than it has confessedly been. What 
was the need of such friends, and whence did they 
arise? 
There was no source of income at first from which 
the salaries of professors could be secured. So the 
unique spectacle was presented of 
a man not only teaching for no 
financial return, but also laboring 
with his own hands to supply the needs of the stu- 
dents that had gathered under his care. Dr. Anderson 
did not receive any regular salary until in 1830. In 
1826, $100 from funds collected for the Seminary

was appropriated to him as an acknowledgment of 
what the directors termed his “disinterested devoted- 
ness” to the interests of the institution! It would be 
easy for a smug critic to find a true bill against the 
worldly wisdom of this strange man; but inasmuch 
as the indictment would equally hold against the 
apostle Paul, Maryville’s sons may well continue to 
be greatly proud of a man who so well fulfilled the law 
that he loved the Lord his God with all his heart, 
and his neighbor even better than himself. 
Dr. Anderson earned his living by toiling in several 
lines of work, but he secured it mainly from his farm, 
and from the churches that he 
oT served. Besides his multitudinous 
activities in other directions, for 
many years he even did a considerable amount of 
manual labor on his farm. The salary from the 
churches was small and usually in arrears. What was 
true of him was true of most of the ante-bellum pro- 
fessors—their living had to be sought principally 
from farms and churches; and they taught school for 
philanthropy’s sake. Salaries were conspicuous by 
their absence. It was demonstrated at Maryville that 
a college can run on very little money if only the 
professors do not draw salaries!

course was had principally to agents, who went into 
the field in behalf of the school. Letters are still 
extant in which Dr. Anderson pleaded with men to act 
as agents. A great deal of hard traveling over many 
States, principally on horseback, and mainly in the 
South and Southwest, was done by these representa- 
tives of the College. Some of them were unable to 
collect amounts sufficient to cover even their ex- 
penses. Rev. E. N. Sawtell, one of the earliest of 
these agents, collected in the Southwest about $2,000, 
part of which was used in part payment for the semi- 
nary farm. He spent one Sabbath at the home of 
Gen. Andrew Jackson. He reported in October, 1828, 
his work from April, 1826, saying that he had traveled 
more than seven thousand miles, and had secured 
$1,335 in cash, and $1,000 in subscriptions. He found 
the lack of a charter impeded his work. He gave 
his services for one year entirely without salary, taking 
only $396 for his traveling expenses, since he had 
spent much of the time in evangelistic work. Most 
of his collections were invested in books for the li- 
brary. Mr. Sawtell made three trips for the Semi- 
nary. 
By far the most successful of the ante-bellum agents 
of the institution, however, was Rev. Thomas Brown, 
an honored graduate of the Seminary, who was or- 
dained in 1828. He was born in 1800 and died in 
1872, and was in the ministry for forty years. A 
very strong preacher and very companionable, he was 
everywhere a welcomed guest. From 1825 until his 
death, says Dr. Craig, he knew every Presbyterian

church, minister, and prominent member in the Synod 
of Tennessee—East Tennessee and Southwestern Vir- 
ginia. His service in the raising of both professor- 
ships will be told in succeeding paragraphs. 
The help for current expenses that was secured was 
received mainly from the church people of Blount 
County and East Tennessee, and 
was expended in the support of the 
students rather than of the professors. The gifts of 
food were used in the boarding-house, while the do- 
nations of clothing and the like were distributed among 
the students. Especially during the early days of the 
Seminary, such contributions were sometimes consid- 
erable in amount. There were “female societies” of 
different churches in different States that contributed, 
and liberally for that day, to the current expenses of 
the students. For example, “a Female Charitable 
Society” of Cherokee Indians contributed ten dollars 
in 1824. The lack of a charter till 1842 made it diffi- 
cult to secure money for permanent funds; and so 
what was given was largely contributed to current 
expenses. 
In 1827 the Synod of Tennessee overtured the Gen- 
eral Assembly of the Presbyterian Church to receive 
the Seminary under its care and Current Help 
aes supervision, provided a professor- 
Fund f ship endowment of $10,000 should 
be secured. Then Revs. Thomas 
Brown, Elijah M. Eagleton, and W. A. McCampbell 
were enlisted as special agents to raise this profes- 
sorship. Most of the fund was raised by Mr. Brown.

THE FRIENDS THAT HELPED 89 
The subscription list, containing the names of almost 
all the old Presbyterian families of Union Presby- 
tery, is printed in full in the Calvimstic Magazine for 
May, 1829. 
In the annual report made in October, 1829, these 
glad words were punctuated with an exclamation 
point: “A subscription has been obtained for found- 
ing the first professorship of $10,686!” The subscrip- 
tions were on a five-year basis. The collection of 
the amounts subscribed was slow and difficult. Pro- 
fessor Lamar states in a manuscript sketch of the 
College that $8,000 of the $10,000 was collected, and 
that, by consent, a part of the amount was appropri- 
ated to completing the payment for the seminary 
farm. This professorship of Didactic Theology is 
the one that Dr. Anderson occupied, and finally it was 
of service to him. Dr. Robinson succeeded Dr. An- 
derson in this professorship. Some of the subscrip- 
tions were void since they were made on condition 
that a charter should be secured for the Seminary. 
In 1843, in the dying days of the theological de- 
partment, a resolution was adopted by Synod pro- 
viding for the raising of $15,000 
eres to establish a professorship of 
Fund Sacred Literature, the payments to 
be made in this case also in annual 
installments during a period of five years. The fact 
that the charter just received (in 1842) from the State 
did not give the Synod the power to elect the directors, 
hindered the securing of subscriptions. But in 1845 
the desired amendment to the charter was obtained, 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
    90 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
and the canvass was then vigorously pushed by Rev. 
Thomas Brown. On October 10, 1846, he reported 
$15,185 as subscribed to the professorship. Synod in 
its vote of thanks to Mr. Brown commended the “zeal 
and fidelity of the indefatigable agent.” By 1858 the 
collections on this fund amounted to $9,500. The 
funds when once received were carefully administered. 
The incumbents of the chair of Sacred Literature 
were Rev. John J. Robinson, 1850-1855, and Rev. 
Thomas J. Lamar, 1857-1861. By 1855 the amount 
of the income of the fund was $540. 
Besides these two regular endowment funds, there 
was contributed for about ten successive years, 1833- 
1843, to the support of Rev. Fielding Pope and others, 
what was called the “Temporary Professorship Fund.” 
The contributors and amounts contributed were usu- 
ally as follows: Samuel Rhea, $60; Rev. James King, 
$30; D. M. Shields & Co., $10; Rev. Frederick A. 
Ross, $60; and W. S. McEwen, $30. Total, $190. 
As early as 1826 the directors urged the necessity 
of endowed scholarships; but whatever help came in 
; was, for many years, only current 
Subsctiptions scholarship aid. In 1854 it was 
proposed that one hundred perma- 
nent scholarship certificates exempting from paying 
tuition and good for thirty years should be sold, at 
$250 each, the proceeds to be devoted to the endow- 
ment of chairs of Mathematics and Modern Science 
in the Literary Department. During the following 
year “not more than fifteen or eighteen of these schol- 
arships were taken.” In 1856 the directors adopted

a modified form of this plan, and succeeded in get- 
ting subscriptions to this fund to the amount of $10,- 
000. Comparatively little of this subscription was 
collected before the War came to sweep away the 
subscription and many of the subscribers. 
There were two ante-bellum treasurers, and they 
deserve to be enrolled on Maryville’s honor roll of 
“friends that helped.” § James 
Berry, Esq., was chosen as the 
first treasurer in 1819, and served 
faithfully and without compensation until his resig- 
nation in 1833. Colonel—afterwards General—Wil- 
liam Wallace was elected his successor, and served 
till his death in 1864. Gen. Wallace served as State 
legislator and several times as a presidential elector 
for Tennessee, and was president of the Knoxville 
and Charleston Railroad. In 1855 the treasurer re- 
ported that the only loss of endowment since the 
founding of the first professorship fund had been one 
of thirty-eight dollars. It is true that the treasurers 
had but a comparatively small amount of money to 
care for, but in those days the money was invested 
in personal notes, and so required a great deal of 
personal attention. In 1855 the bond of the treasurer 
was $20,000. Up to the Civil War, during the treas- 
urership of Gen. Wallace, only eighty dollars of the 
investments was lost, and even that loss did not fall 
upon the College, for the treasurer paid the amount 
out of his own means. The long terms of service on 
the part of Treasurers Berry and Wallace were valu- 
able contributions to the welfare of the institution. Faithful

When we take into account the excessive amount 
of work that had to be done, and the fact that the 
high-water mark of the salaries 
received by the professors in Mary- 
ville College in ante-bellum times 
was $600, and the low-water mark $000, it can hardly 
be wondered at that it was very difficult to persuade 
men to accept professorships at Maryville. Families 
must live, and the cost of living calls for some sal- 
ary. But the directors, though beggars, were choosers, 
for this is a sample of what they said: “The pro- 
fessor to fill the chair of Sacred Literature shall be 
a man who has received the highest advantages of 
education offered in the United States.” Dr. Ballen- 
tine declined this chair in 1849, and Dr. William Eagle- 
ton in 1850. The directors became very much ac- 
customed to having their proposals rejected. 
When, however, a man felt it his duty to become 
a professor at Maryville, the Maryville spirit of dis- 
interested benevolence seemed to 
get possession of him, and he made 
such sacrifices for the institution 
as one would be expected to make only for his own 
family. If salary was missing, the man taught on, 
as if such small matters as food and raiment were 
not at all involved in the case. 
The budget—how was it financed? Principally by 
the teachers’ working for practically nothing. And 
they did so for the kingdom of heaven’s sake. Their 
small tuition fees, the meager salaries paid them by 
the churches to which they preached on the Sabbath Difficulty in

day, and the income of their farms, kept the wolf 
from the door, so that they could almost donate 
their services to the institution. 
In making an honor roll, then, of the friends that 
helped the school, the highest place in that roll must 
be given to the professors who served their institution 
with such self-sacrificing liberality and fidelity.

CHAPTER IX 
THE PLant THAT Hap To SERVE 
TuE large double log house, seventy feet long, with 
its two stories and its rooms, thirty feet by thirty, 
that was the home of Union Acad- 
The Log Academy emy in Grassy Valley was de- 
scribed somewhat in detail in the third chapter. It 
was a rather ambitious school building for 1802, and 
was several times larger than Rev. William Tennent’s 
historic ‘Log College,” the mother of all later Presby- 
terian schools of higher learning. When Rev. George 
Whitefield visited the Log College at Neshaminy, near 
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, he wrote as follows: “The 
place where the young men study now (1739) is, in 
contempt, called The College. It is a log house, about 
twenty feet long and near as many broad, and to me 
it seemed to resemble the school of the old prophets. 
. .. All that we can say of most of our universities 
is, They are glorious without.” 
Dr. Anderson conducted his academy, after his re- 
moval to Maryville, apparently in more modest quar- 
ters, one academy building, as we have seen, stand- 
ing where the old jail afterward stood, and the other 
old log cabin standing on the banks of Pistol Creek 
where the railroad culvert has since been built.

    THE PLANT THAT HAD TO SERVE 95 
Dr. Anderson had young men studying in his own 
house during the years that preceded the opening 
of the Seminary. His residence 
was a frame building standing 
where the Armory stood a few 
years ago, but, as we have seen, it was destroyed by 
fire in 1856. The class that Dr. Anderson gathered 
in 1819 was one to be instructed in literary branches, 
the Seminary being formally opened in 1822. The 
class of five gathered in 1819 recited in “a little brown 
house” standing on Main Street on the north corner 
of the lot where Mr. A. K. Harper’s residence now 
stands. It was brown, not with paint, but because 
weather-beaten. It stood until after the War. Mr. 
Eli Nunn occupied it for a while. This was used 
probably until the seminary brick building was com- 
pleted, two or three years later. Dr. Anderson also 
frequently used his own residence for one or more 
recitations. 
In 1820 a small unfinished two-story brick build- 
ing that had been intended for a female academy, 
: was purchased for $600 from the 
The Brick House trustees of the academy, one of with Six ; Fireplaces whom was Isaac Anderson him- 
self. The building stood on the 
half lot at the east corner of the two lots on which 
New Providence Church now stands. It was about 
twenty-five feet by forty. The Boston Recorder for 
December 9, 1820, announces the purchase as fol- 
lows: “The Directors of the Southern and Western 
Theological Seminary report that they have purchased “The Little 
Brown House”
-P-A-G-E-130
96 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
a lot and eligible building in Maryville, Tennessee, 
for the use of the Institution at the low price of $600. 
The building is of brick, two stories high, with six 
fireplaces. The appointed professor is preparing a 
course of lectures on didactic theology, and will hold 
himself in readiness to communicate all the informa- 
tion he may be able in the whole course of prescribed 
studies, until other professors shall be chosen.” 
The building had one large room and two small 
rooms downstairs and similar rooms upstairs. The 
small rooms were used for dormitory purposes; the 
large room upstairs was used for the library, and 
the large room downstairs was usually employed for 
recitations. Professor Lamar, while a student, roomed 
in this building. 
The completion of the building involved an expense 
that was met by different gifts, but principally by 
collections made by agents. This was the theological 
seminary building, and it was constantly in use until 
the Civil War. While Federal troops camped in 
Maryville they tore down the brick seminary to fur- 
nish bricks for their “Dutch ovens’! Some of the 
bricks may still be seen in a brick walk at John P. 
Duncan’s home. 
In 1824, for the sum of $400, a lot and a half, ad- 
joining the lot on which the seminary building stood, 
t and containing two small frame 
ore Oe buildings, was purchased for the 
Buildings boarding-house that Dr. Anderson 
had decided to establish. He em- 
ployed a steward and opened the boarding-house.
-P-A-G-E-131
THE PLANT THAT HAD TO SERVE 97 
When these buildings were removed to allow the main 
building of later years to be erected, the boarding- 
house was located elsewhere. While the farm was 
owned, the boarding-house was located upon it, near 
the spring now called the Goddard spring; while, 
during the Fifties at least, it was situated on the south 
side of Church Street, only a stone’s throw from the 
main building. Most of these boarding-houses were 
frame buildings, small, and inexpensively built. 
In 1825 Dr. Anderson “got his eye on the farm 
which adjoins the grounds on which the Maryville 
College buildings now stand,” and sent Mr. Sawtell to 
Mississippi and Louisiana to raise the money needed 
to buy it. Mr. Sawtell returned after a hard winter’s 
work with, perhaps, two thousand dollars. The farm 
consisted of two hundred acres, of which eighty acres 
were in cultivation, and was purchased at a cost of 
$2,500. As has been said, it was located in what is 
now called South Maryville. It contained a com- 
modious dwelling house, a barn, and other houses, and 
was well watered by springs. From the first it was 
the dream of Dr. Anderson and the directors to re- 
move the entire institution to this quieter home, where 
the boys would be removed from “the noise and con- 
fusion of the town.” Maryville was then a giddy 
little city of perhaps fifty houses, and perhaps two 
hundred and fifty inhabitants. But the dream was 
not realized during the lifetime of Dr. Anderson. 
The brick building was “the Seminary.” In 1829 
arrangements were made to erect a frame building, 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
  98 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
thirty feet by sixty, two stories high, for the separate 
use of the literary students, as the college department 
young men were called. Four years later (1833) the 
building was finished, ready for 
use except the putting up of a 
chimney, and the citizens had 
subscribed sixty dollars towards 
the chimney. There was paid out on the building 
that year the sum of $623. Two years later (1835) 
the directors reported that they were then finishing 
the building! The building was located on the north- 
west corner of the lot, and faced Main Street, and 
was flush with it. 
This building also had six rooms. The first floor 
was used as the chapel except for two small rooms at 
the southwest end, one of which was a laboratory with 
chemical and philosophical apparatus, and the other 
a recitation room, long occupied by Professor Pope. 
The chapel would seat from one hundred and fifty to 
two hundred, and was also used for prayer meetings 
and Sabbath school, and Dr. Craig used it as a recita- 
tion room. The pulpit was on a three feet by four 
platform boxed up about three feet high, and was 
located in the east corner of the room. One of our 
older citizens recalls seeing John M. Caldwell ordained 
to the ministry in this old chapel, on April 2, 1851. 
The two small rooms upstairs were used for class- 
rooms or dormitory rooms, and the large room for 
the Beth-Hacma Literary Society hall. A circular 
belfry containing a small bell surmounted the build- The “New”

ing. A big fish-shaped weather-vane hung above 
the belfry. 
The exterior of the building, “had it not been for 
the numerous windows, might have been taken by a 
stranger passing through the place for a cattle barn”! 
There was no fence about the square. A grove of 
locust trees covered the little campus. 
In the south corner of the half-acre campus there 
also stood a little frame building owned by the Beth- 
Hacma ve Berith Literary Society and used by its 
members for their meetings. 
In 1849 the Directors reported to Synod that they 
had an agent in the field collecting money “for rearing 
a College Edifice,” and that he had 
secured subscriptions for $2,000 in 
Maryville and vicinity. The next 
year the subscriptions had been increased to $3,000. 
In 1851 the members of Synod pledged themselves 
“not to let the enterprise fail for the want of the 
aid in their power.” In 1853 the building had been 
commenced and the walls were expected to be erected 
and covered that fall. It was located just back of 
the frame building and in the center of the two lots. 
In 1855 a portion of the building would soon be 
ready for use. In 1856 ten rooms had been com- 
pleted, and some of them had been occupied as class- 
rooms and some of the others by students. The 
frame “College” was removed when the brick “Col- 
lege” was far enough advanced to be used. In 1858 
the debt on the new building was $2,000, and $1,000 
was needed to finish it. “The Brick

The catalog of 1854 thus describes the building: 
“A large and handsome college building is soon to 
be completed. It is of brick, three stories high, and 
presents a front of 110 feet. It contains a chapel, 
four recitation rooms, study and lodging rooms suf- 
ficient to accommodate sixty or seventy students, and 
two halls for the use of the literary societies. ... 
The building, when entirely completed, will be worth 
$10,000, and will afford ample accommodations for 
the present.” 
This most ambitious building of the College before 
the War was never completed, though it was used in 
its incomplete condition for several years. The War 
found it incomplete and left it a ruin. Its story 
will be taken up again. The pen and ink sketch of 
the building found in this volume was drawn by 
John E. Patton, a student of the College during the 
years 1849-1852. 
During the greater part of the ante-bellum period 
New Providence Church occupied the old stone church 
which was 101 feet by 60 in dimen- 
a Stone sions. Mr. James Gillespie, writ- 
ing in 1895, said of the old days: 
“In those days almost all the public exhibitions at 
the close of the term were held either in the large 
stone church, which stood where now stands Colum- 
bian Hall, or at the camp ground located where Mr. 
Hyden now lives. Usually at the closing exercises 
the graduating class, with the help of the ladies, would 
fit up the old stone church in a becoming style. Gen- 
erally at this time the two societies would close the

exercises with a debate; this debate was at night, and 
at that time we had no electric lights, no gas lights, 
not even coal-oil lamps; in fact nothing ordinarily 
but home-made tallow candles; but on these grand 
occasions we would send to Knoxville and get a lot 
of sperm candles, and it took a lot of them, you may 
be sure, to light up the large old church. A large 
home-made chandelier was hung in the center and 
filled with these candles and festooned in beautiful 
style. On these occasions the old church, which would 
seat some fifteen to eighteen hundred people, was usu- 
ally packed to its utmost capacity. Sometimes at the 
close of the year, in place of a debate, the societies 
would get up an exhibition, and when this was the 
case the old camp-ground shed would be brought into 
requisition, and I do not think I exaggerate when 
I say that there were sometimes from 2,500 to 3,000 
persons gathered to witness these plays.” 
President Robinson and Professor Lamar recog- 
nized the unfavorable and cramped location of the 
a College on its town lots on Main 
Dream Buildings Street, and looked enviously over 
ne South toward “the south hills,” where a § beautiful location could anywhere 
be found for a new Maryville College. So pressing 
did the need of removal seem to them that they se- 
cured from the Synod, in 1858, the adoption of reso- 
lutions authorizing a special committee to make an 
appeal to “persons of well-known benevolence and 
Christian liberality to furnish voluntary contributions 
for the erection of new buildings in the vicinity of 
     
-P-A-G-E-138
102 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
Maryville for the use of Maryville College.” It was 
specified that “no building shall be undertaken until 
ten thousand dollars cash in hand shall have been 
obtained.” The donor should have the privilege of 
naming the building he erected. The wildest dreams 
of those days have now been far more than realized. 
A little city crowns the “south hills.” 
“So great was their faith in the feasibility of their 
plans,” says Captain W. H. Henry, “and such their 
determination to see them carried out, that Dr. Robin- 
son and Professor Lamar gave their joint personal 
obligations for $2,000 to secure fifty acres of ground 
just west of the present grounds for that purpose.” 
The Civil War, however, put an end to all this dream- 
ing and planning. 
Such, then, was the plant that had to serve the Col- 
lege before the War. Professor Lamar sums it up 
in the brief lines: ‘At the begin- 
ning of the Civil War the endow- 
ment fund of the College amount- 
ed to about $16,000. The real estate consisted of 
two half-acre lots with three buildings—one wooden 
(the boarding-house), one small brick, and a large 
brick unfinished. The library contained about 6,000 
volumes. The indebtedness of the College amounted 
to $1,000.” Total Property at

CHAPTER X 
CRISES AND THE CATACLYSM 
As has, certainly, been indicated by the preceding 
chapters, Maryville College really had never, thus 
far, been free from a crisis. 
“Crisis” was engaged in a continu- 
ous performance. There had been 
good and sufficient reasons in every year of the his- 
tory of the institution to give up the whole attempt to 
keep the school in operation. The question was not 
whether the reasons for giving up were sufficiently 
strong, but it was, rather, whether the spirit of self- 
denying service on the part of the professors in 
charge would become sufficiently weak to be finally 
exhausted. The splendid fact was, as we have seen, 
that the college altruism did not fail; and so the con- 
tinuous crisis did not end in a cataclysm. The College 
lived right on in spite of the chronic crisis. Pluck, 
prayer, and perseverance defied the ever-threatening 
disaster. 
There were three attempts to remove the institu- 
tion from Maryville. The first took place at the very 
beginning of the career of the institution. There was 
a strong body of Tennessee Presbyterians west of the 
Cumberlands who very naturally wanted the new semi- 
103 A Continuous 
Crisis
-P-A-G-E-140
104 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
nary to be located within reaching distance of their 
churches. There was much preliminary sparring pre- 
: paratory to the real battle, which 
Fin Through battle took place at the meeting of ttempts at ‘ Removal Synod at Murfreesboro, in 1823. 
Murfreesboro was then the capital 
of the State. Governor Carroll was inaugurated while 
Synod was in session. 
When the great debate between Dr. Isaac Ander- 
son and Dr. Gideon Blackburn about the location of 
the Seminary was in progress, most of the legislators 
were interested spectators. The East Tennessee dele- 
gates to Synod were in a hopeless minority, for only 
six were present; but their champion, Dr. Anderson, 
adopted the Napoleonic strategy of “Divide and con- 
quer.” He had Dr. Blackburn’s plan read and dis- 
cussed seriatim, and succeeded in convincing the Synod 
of its impracticability in all its parts. The decision 
as to the permanent location of the Seminary was 
“deferred to some future meeting.” The next year 
at Columbia, the Synod resolved that “the Southern 
and Western Theological Seminary be, and it hereby 
is, permanently located at Maryville in East Ten- 
nessee.” 
The second attempt to remove the Seminary was a 
peculiar one. Dr. Hardin, in the field as an agent 
of the Seminary in 1827, entered into an agreement at 
Danville to remove the Seminary to Danville, to con- 
solidate it with the seminary that the Kentucky people 
had under contemplation. Then he carried a round- 
robin agreement throughout southwestern Virginia and 
 
-P-A-G-E-141
  
CRISES AND THE CATACLYSM 105 
East Tennessee and secured the signature of every 
Presbyterian minister except Rev. William Minnis. 
Dr. Minnis was one of the first graduates of the Semi- 
nary, and for nearly forty years he proved himself 
a Stonewall in defense of his alma mater. Others 
surrendered, but he never. 
Dr. Anderson was at first crushed, and, in tears on 
account of the seeming ingratitude of the brethren, 
signed the round robin ; but he soon regained his nerve, 
and with Dr. Minnis, Dr. McCampbell, and others, 
snatched victory out of defeat. In a letter written at 
this time, Dr. Anderson stated that he had nineteen 
reasons why he was unwilling that the Seminary 
should cease its existence. The friends of Maryville 
rallied, and raised the $10,000 subscription for the 
first endowed professorship, of which mention has 
already been made. This put a quietus on Dr. Har- 
din’s plan. 
Early in the Fifties the College passed through a 
crisis that was almost fatal to it. The great national 
crisis was in precipitation, but the 
college crisis anticipated it several 
years. The principal occasion of 
the crisis was the collapse of the physical and mental 
powers of Dr. Anderson. For several years before 
his death, in 1857, Dr. Anderson’s disability removed 
his strong hand from the helm. His second child- 
hood was a pathetic and yet noble one, as was shown 
in his farewell conversation with his old pupil, Dr. 
Abel Pearson. The number of students in attend- 
ance greatly decreased. The financial difficulties of Crisis of 
the Fifties 
     
-P-A-G-E-142

the school became so acute that, as has been said 
before, the faculty collapsed, and Dr. Craig was left 
as the only professor in the school, and in 1856, at 
least, no instruction in the theological department was 
given. For several years no professor of mathematics 
was elected for lack of a salary. 
Naturally there was much criticism of the College 
while its fortunes were at this low ebb. At Blount- 
ville, Synod appointed a special committee on the 
general subject of the building up of a strong college 
and theological seminary. The majority report pre- 
vailed, opening the way for the removal of the insti- 
tution from Maryville to some other place. Dr. Will- 
iam Minnis, thirty years after his first “Stonewall” 
service, presented a brief but incisive report opposing 
the transfer for five conclusive reasons. He concluded 
his report with the earnest words: “We therefore 
would recommend that the Synod, in place of pulling 
down and starting anew, would proceed harmoniously 
to build upon our present foundations, laid in prayers, 
tears, and self-denials, and almost the sacrifice of 
life.” Dr. Craig says of “the curly-headed Scotch- 
Irishman,” Dr. Minnis: ‘East Tennessee never, per- 
haps, had an abler and more logical preacher and 
defender of the truth. He was one of the Boanerges.” 
The next year (1856), at Athens, the Synod by a de- 
cisive vote resolved that “it would be inexpedient 
to accept the proposals to found another literary and 
theological institution within our bounds.” The liberal 
offer of Rogersville was, however, put on record. It 
was an offer of one hundred and forty scholarships 
 
-P-A-G-E-143
    
CRISES AND THE CATACLYSM 107 
of $250 each, and of the local Presbyterian church 
building and lot, on condition that Rogersville should 
be the site of the new institution. Thus ended the 
third and last attempt to remove the institution to 
some other location. 5 
The next day Rev. Thomas Jefferson Lamar was 
elected Professor of Sacred Literature. The next 
year Dr. Robinson was elected president, and seemed 
soon to harmonize the discordant elements in the 
Synod. 
During this decade the theological department was 
almost extinct. There was, usually, only one or two 
enrolled in the department. The 
The Seminary poverty of the school made it Department : 
Dormant easier for young men to decide to 
go to other seminaries that had 
now been established, and that were available by rail- 
road. Out of the college class of 1850, three gradu- 
ates went elsewhere to a seminary. The Education 
Society no longer aided the candidates for the min- 
istry. There had been for many years a seculariza- 
tion, not of the College, but of the age. The Synod 
lamented from year to year the paucity of candidates 
for the ministry. The result of these various influ- 
ences was the virtual extinction of the theological 
department before the Civil War finally deposited it 
among the other wreckage of the past. 
The college department had been found necessary 
at the very beginning of the Seminary, and so the 
constitution had been changed to provide for it. It 
was evident from the earliest days that, whatever
-P-A-G-E-144
  108 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
might be true of the theological department, the col- 
lege department would develop just as rapidly as the 
facilities provided for it might make it possible. The 
conspicuous service of the semi- 
Eee nary department was rendered dur- 
ing the first twenty-three years of 
the life of the institution. The charter of “Maryville 
College” was secured in 1842; and, by chance, that is 
the date when the seminary passes into eclipse and the 
college department begins to shine in full brightness. 
The late Hon. J. G. Wallace, of Franklin, one of 
Treasurer Wallace’s sons, received in 1844 the first 
printed diploma issued by the College. From 1842 
to 1861 the seminary was merely nominal, while 
the college developed steadily, and, to the extent of its 
limited facilities, came to be strong and scholarly and 
successful. As time passed, the nomenclature ad- 
justed itself to the new conditions, and the institution 
was spoken of as “the College” instead of “the Semi- 
nary.” As has been said, plans for a new location 
and for larger facilities were being made at the very 
time when the Civil War—the end of the world, as 
it seemed—burst upon the country. 
The field of the College was broadening. The At- 
lanta Constitution of April 23, 1886, gave a list of 
Broadening twenty-three prominent citizens of 
Field DeKalb County, Georgia, who had 
been educated in Maryville College. Several of them 
were in attendance during the Fifties. The clientage 
of the school was waking up to the opportunities at 
Maryville, and the character of the work done there. 
 
-P-A-G-E-145
    CRISES AND THE CATACLYSM 109 
Most of the Southwestern States were represented 
in the attendance of the last two or three years of 
the ante-bellum College. Had not the War intervened, 
it was probable that the enrollment of students would 
soon have greatly increased. It did increase from 
sixty in 1857 to over one hundred in 1861. President 
Robinson, Professors Craig and Lamar, and a tutor 
made a strong and efficient faculty, and the work was 
more consistent and better articulated than for many 
years. There were indications also of the existence 
of a larger number of friends ready to cooperate 
with the College. Maryville was, evidently, coming 
into its own. 
One of the invaluable records destroyed when the 
library of Dr. Anderson was consumed by fire was 
a private register, gratefully kept 
Work of by the Doctor, of those who had Theological b d d for th ‘a Department een educated tor the ministry at 
Maryville since the founding of 
the Seminary. That was, doubtless, the only complete 
list that was ever in existence. In the catalog of 
1859 a list of about one hundred ministers educated 
in the Seminary was published. Professor Lamar, 
however, added many names to the list, and stated 
that the entire number of such ministers amounted 
to at least one hundred and fifty. A remarkable 
achievement was this to be wrought amid such limi- 
tations of men and money as prevailed at this frontier 
Seminary. 
The loss of all the records makes it impossible 
also to give any exact summary of the work of the
-P-A-G-E-146
  110 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
college department. There is no record available of 
even the number of graduates of the College in ante- 
bellum days. It is believed that there were at least 
two hundred and fifty of them in 
a oa all departments, and that is 
the number used as a basis for 
the statistical summaries of the work of the institu- 
tion. The catalog of 1858 says: “Hundreds of young 
men have been educated for the learned professions 
who have attained to positions of eminence and use- 
fulness.” 
In a section of the country and at a period when 
there were few preparatory schools and no high 
schools, it was necessary for every 
a college to conduct a preparatory 
Depastaskt department. Indeed, there was 
then hardly a college in the United 
States that did not have such a department. In Mary- 
ville there were many students who afterward were 
the leading business men of the section who received 
what education they had in this department. The 
teaching was done in part by student assistants—often 
mature men—and in part by the regular professors 
of the college and the seminary. The attendance was 
about the same as in the college department. The 
debt owed by the state to the voluntary and indis- 
pensable aid afforded by the church schools in the 
days when the state was doing comparatively little 
for popular education can never be fully appreciated 
or liquidated. 
One man is not so impressive a sight as are forty, 
 
-P-A-G-E-147
  
CRISES AND THE CATACLYSM 111 
but one man in forty years may accomplish what 
forty men could do in one year, or even more than 
they. A modest school may not attract much public 
attention or applause, but in the 
tae One course of many years it may effect 
much more than do some more 
ambitious schools of fewer years. With the facili- 
ties at command, and with the hindrances to be met, 
surely old Maryville has performed as worthy a ser- 
vice as any institution has ever rendered. 
In the progress of the years, the quiet college halls 
caught the sound of discordant debate and angry dis- 
cussion, and witnessed premoni- 
tions, perhaps at the time not treat- 
ed seriously, of the coming national 
division and desolation. The muttered threat, suc- 
ceeded by angry quarreling, was suddenly drowned out 
by the heart-stirring bugle blast summoning men to 
arms! The clarion calls of hostile bugles echoed and 
reechoed among the East Tennessee hills, and awoke 
in young and brave and excited hearts a response that 
boded ill for the continuance of college work. The call 
of patriotism, the impulse of passion, the love of ad- 
venture, the ignominy of cowardice—all sounded louder 
than did the quiet tones of peace and school and home. 
The Latin maxim, “In the midst of arms, the laws 
are silent,’ may be freely adapted to say: In the time 
of war, schools are closed. Fort 
Sumter was fired upon on April 
12, 1861. By dint of much self- 
possession and with many searchings of heart the Bugle Call

professors and their students had managed to con- 
tinue their usual work during the turmoil of the 
months since November, 1860; and even now they 
were able to hold on with their work for a few days 
longer. But it was impossible that the quiet pursuits 
of peace could be followed in the presence of the 
cataclysm of civil war, and especially so in the Volun- 
teer State, where men are always prompt to answer 
their country’s call. 
On April 22, 1861, less than a week after the first 
blood of the Civil War was spilled, the last chapel 
exercise was held. Dr. Robinson conducted the ser- 
vice, and announced the suspension of the college 
work “on account of a state of armed hostilities in 
the country.” And the teachers and students sep- 
arated, most of them to take up arms for whichever 
cause seemed right to them. Some of the students 
were to die in battle or in the hospital; and not one 
of them was to come back to the old College when 
the cruel war was over. Their schooldays at Mary- 
ville were ended. 
It was sadly typical of the divisions made by the 
War that of the four teachers—three professors and 
one tutor—at work in 1861 two 
sympathized with the Union and 
two with the Confederacy. Of the students some 
“went North’ and some “went South’; and some 
found themselves arrayed against their friends and 
kinsmen and a few even against their fathers. Those 
were dreadful days and they tried men’s souls. 
And all that Maryville’s lovers of the church, of edu- The Cataclysm 
 
-P-A-G-E-149
  CRISES AND THE CATACLYSM 113 
cation, and of the future could do was to do what 
seemed to them their duty; and then to live or die, 
as the Lord of Sabaoth should determine. And, yet, 
perhaps, in God’s good time, there might some day be 
such a thing as peace again; and peaceful ways and 
works; and, possibly, open schools; and, if the AI- 
mighty God should lay bare his mighty arm, there 
might be—yes, there might be—some day, another 
Maryville College, with its old-time altruism, bidding 
the young people of the Southwest to enter as of 
yore! 
Men fought and waited, and the thoughtful ones 
prayed as they fought, and watched as they waited, 
and sometimes caught a vision of a possible answer to 
their prayers, so that their hearts were glad with 
a joy that can not be measured: 
“Peace! and no longer from its brazing portals 
The blast of War’s great organ shakes the skies! 
But beautiful as songs of the immortals, 
The holy melodies of love arise.”

PART SECOND. THE POST-BELLUM 
MARYVILLE 
CHAPTER I 
CoLLEcE Rurns—1865-1869 
It seemed as if the four weary years of the Civil 
War would never end. At last, however, the thunder 
of hostile guns died away, and men said that peace 
had come. The armies disbanded, and their veterans 
took up again the pursuits of other days. Man must 
do his work even if his heart is sore. 
It was a dark day in 1865, and Professor Lamar 
stood alone and heart-sick at the intersection of Main 
; and College Streets, in the little 
ee town of Maryse. | The Goad 
- hung lowering over the scene. They resembled the 
smoke of battle, but they were only natural clouds 
of mist, and not the unnatural smoke of civil strife. 
The War, thank God, was over. But not so, as yet, 
were the results of war. The ruin and wreckage of 
that abomination of desolation had not yet been cleared 
away. The town looked grim and gloomy, indeed. 
The old Court House up the street showed ghastly 
wounds inflicted by shot and shell fired by Wheeler’s 
115 
 
-P-A-G-E-154
  116 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
men; beyond and opposite the Court House, on both 
sides of the street, the principal business portion of 
the town lay in cinders and ashes, as another memento 
of Wheeler’s raid; while down the street the ram- 
shackle hotel, the successor of an important inn on 
“the Federal Road,” showed by its shattered windows 
and plaster pillars all agape that unhappy days had 
befallen the hospitable old hostelry. 
The few men that rode horseback up Main Street 
—for there were few buggies to use in those days— 
some of them wore suits of blue or brown jeans that 
had been woven, cut, and made at home. Here and 
there a suit of soldier’s blue or gray that had outlived 
the camp and campaign were reminders of a house 
divided against itself. The farms from which the 
horsemen had come were most of them gully-gashed, 
fenceless, and wretchedly stocked with the left-over 
cavalry wrecks of cruel war—for war is as destructive 
of horses as it is of men. 
In those early post-bellum days, whenever the cau- 
tious reserve and prudent reticence into which the 
Bisow ani Griel people had been trained by the 
daily dangers of war, were put 
aside, it could easily be seen that there was heavy 
gloom within as well as without. There were many 
hearts and homes of mourning for the dead of many 
battle-fields ; and many hearts of hate for wrongs in- 
flicted during those irresponsible years of bloodshed. 
Mingled even with the profound happiness arising 
out of the fact that the war was over, were suspicion 
and anxiety and dread as to the future. 
 
-P-A-G-E-155
    COLLEGE RUINS—186s-1869 117 
But while the professor standing at the meeting of 
the ways felt the gloom about him, as during all the 
sad Sixties he had felt it, what 
gave him especial concern just 
then was the scene immediately be- 
fore him. The two quarter-acre town lots now graced 
by the beautiful edifice of New Providence Church 
were then occupied by the one surviving building of 
Maryville College—the three-story brick building, 
which had not been completed at the outbreak of the 
War, and which now in the last stages of dilapidation 
would surely never be completed. Indeed, the boys 
who played about the doorless structure might well 
have found a safer place for their sport. 
The “College,” poorly built at best, after serving 
both armies as barracks and stable for four destruc- 
tive years, was now a mere shell, an unsubstantial 
ghost of an unsatisfactory building. The door-frames 
and window-frames had been torn out for fuel. Its 
smaller and older companion, the little two-story, six- 
roomed brick “Seminary,” located in the east corner 
of the narrow campus, had been torn away in war 
times, as we have seen, by the blue-jackets to make 
ovens for the mess shanties on their camping ground. 
The main building itself might appropriately have 
shared the fate of its smaller colleague, for it surely 
was suitable for nothing better; it was a disreputable 
old hulk. 
And not only was the building a wreck, but it did 
not even belong to the College. It had been sold for 
debt during the War. It was no longer “Maryville Dilapidation and 
Desolation
-P-A-G-E-156
118 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
College,” but was merely a battered piece of property 
owned by other parties. 
The professor who stood there had graduated from 
the College seventeen years before, and had been 
elected a professor in it nine years 
roe before, and had stayed by it 
throughout the dark years of the 
War, and had prayed for it every day at family wor- 
ship, and still loved it with all his soul. As he viewed 
his dear old college home in ruins, he had the addi- 
tional sorrow of knowing that those friends of the 
College that would have helped rebuild its walls, if 
they could, were themselves the victims of war, and 
were not able to lend any appreciable help in the re- 
building of a college. Reduced to hard straits by the 
War, they had enough trouble, penury, and poverty 
of their own, without assuming any in behalf of a 
defunct school. Let it remain dead! Public spirit 
was dead. Many precious lives had passed away 
during the holocaust of the four years; one corporate 
life, more or less, was of little moment compared with 
those costly losses of fathers and husbands and 
brothers and sons that had filled the land with one 
long-continued agony. 
What! build the College again! One professor, 
one building in ruins, no property, and no friends able 
to help! And the teacher looked 
up and down the street, and across 
the desolate hills on either side, and 
the sight was sufficient to proclaim as only an idle 
dream the fancy of attempting to build a college on A Glimmering 
Ray of Hope 
 
-P-A-G-E-157
   
  COLLEGE RUINS—1865-1869 119 
such ruins as lay before him. Where was help to 
be found? He had looked on every side to no avail. 
Now, like Isaac Anderson of the earlier days, when 
all else failed, he looked within and saw the glim- 
mering hope of a resolute human will. And yet he 
felt that only if there were windows in heaven could 
these things be! However, he looked upward, and 
there he saw a window ajar, and a glimmer of hope 
shining through. And then he went on his way, some- 
what cheered in heart and altogether resolute in will, 
to do what man could do to rebuild the walls of his 
Zion. Since there was a window in heaven, please 
God, these things could and should be. 
~ On an October day in 1865 our preacher-teacher 
went to New Market to attend the first meeting of 
; the Synod of Tennessee that was 
 Haeniapeg held after the Civil War, and, in- deed, the first since 1862. Should 
the Synod reopen the College? In the discussion, an 
earnest address of Hon. Horace Maynard had much 
to do with leading the Synod to determine to attempt 
the seemingly impossible. The following day thirty- 
six directors were elected. The Synod then ordered 
the newly-appointed directors to elect a treasurer, to 
redeem the property, to pay debts, and to invest what 
might remain in suitable securities; and it also di- 
rected that the advisability of appointing one or two 
professors should be taken under consideration. A 
committee chosen to consider the appointment of an 
agent to attempt to secure funds for the College
-P-A-G-E-158
    120 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
nominated Professor Thomas Jefferson Lamar, the 
man of the vision, to serve as such an agent. 
And all this constructive planning took place at 
a Synod where the Committee on the Narrative of 
the State of Religion began its re- 
port with these infinitely pathetic 
words: “Oh, that my head were 
waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might 
weep day and night for the slain of the daughter 
of my people! The waves of war have swept up and 
down the valley of our East Tennessee, and the fence- 
less fields, the unmended roads, the prostrate forests, 
the open schoolhouses without windows and doors, 
and the dismantled churches mark the path of the 
fiery surges. The dead are sleeping in our valleys 
and along our hillsides, and the soil of many a field 
has been wet with human blood.” 
Professor Lamar returned to Maryville the unsal- 
aried but divinely commissioned man whose business 
: it was to reestablish Maryville 
ease College. Late in December, 1865, 
he made a trip to the North in the 
hope that he might secure help for the College. Shrink- 
ing from the work of solicitation of help, he still did 
manfully for the College what he never would have 
done for any other cause; but apparently all in vain. 
He returned in April, 1866, having secured only one 
hundred and twenty-five dollars, while the expenses 
of the journey were one hundred and ninety-eight 
dollars. What had become of that window above? 
Ah, well! he was merely learning that the infinitely Synodical

patient God will not greatly use any one until that 
one has schooled himself to do his best and then bide 
God’s time. 
Instead of despairing, as he should have done had 
it not been for his seeing the Invisible, he returned 
home, as “in the beginning’ Dr. Anderson did from 
his historic visit to Princeton, to make a college him- 
self, since others would not provide it. In view of the 
fact that he had no money to invest, again like Dr. 
Anderson, he determined to invest himself. And this 
is just what Providence wants—a man with whom and 
through whom to work. With God the man is the 
most important endowment of any cause. The man 
he must have; the money he already has an abund- 
ance of in reserve, and when he sees best he will, 
as he has done in the case of Maryville, most gener- 
ously provide it. 
On an auspicious and patriotic day, July 4, 1866, 
Professor Lamar, through Rev. Ralph E. Tedford, 
‘ the Recorder of the Directors and 
a ee the father of the future Mrs. La- 
mar, issued a one-paged circular 
announcing that Maryville College would reopen on 
the first Wednesday of September, 1866. By cor- 
respondence and visits, the Professor did what he 
could to secure students. Those were days of home 
and farm reconstruction, and many who longed for 
an education could not be spared from their homes. 
However, on the morning of September 5, Professor 
Lamar, the acting-president and acting-faculty and 
acting-janitor of the College, rang the same old cruel- 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
  122 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
throated bell that throughout the decades has sum- 
moned the students to their tasks. Soon there gath- 
ered for the first post-bellum chapel exercise thirteen 
young men, most of whom had come directly from 
the farm: Frank M. Allen, George E. Bicknell, Gid- 
eon S. W. Crawford, Calvin A. Duncan, James A. 
Goddard, Benjamin H. Lea, Isaac A. Martin, William 
H. Porter, Edward W. Sanderson, Hugh W. Sawyer, 
Joseph P. Tedford, Charles E. Tedford, and Edward 
W. Tedford. Four of the thirteen had been soldier 
boys. And all the company had the spirit of the 
thirteen “No Surrender” apprentice lads of London- 
derry. One of the number afterward said: “Every- 
thing was so horrible and disgusting that some of 
the students almost determined to leave in spite of 
the professor’s entreaties. But after attachments were 
formed, and the number of students had increased, the 
school went on finely.” 
The modest endowment and the limited property of 
the ante-bellum days were almost entirely swept away 
by the besom of war. All that 
re could be gathered from the dust 
and ashes of 1865 amounted to about six thousand 
dollars in value. Small salvage, indeed! But there 
was salvage of another kind whose value could not 
be computed in terms of the dollar and its multiples. 
When Professor Lamar gazed on the ruins of Mary- 
ville he saw in his mind’s eye more than appeared 
before ‘him. The finances were, indeed, phantoms; 
but not so was the memory of the men that made 
Maryville in the early days. Those men stood be-
-P-A-G-E-163
  COLLEGE RUINS—1865-1869 123 
fore him again in all their faith, fidelity, devotion, and 
heroic zeal, and he felt his own brave spirit grow 
braver. As he himself said: “The work of these men 
formed a basis on which to stand and from which 
to work and appeal for help with encouragement and 
hope.” 
What he saw in part and imperfectly, God saw in 
full and perfectly. The foundations that God saw 
had more of tears and self-denial 
and loving consecration in them 
than they had of dollars and bricks 
and mortar. The achievements that God saw were not 
classic halls and ivied towers and scholastic pomp, but 
buildings of human intelligence and structures of 
beneficent character and homes of modest helpfulness, 
which the builders of early Maryville had constructed. 
The endowments that God saw were not the perishable 
riches of men but the imperishable treasure of Chris- 
tian manhood laid up by prayer and praise before 
the very throne of God in heaven. This was the most 
active endowment that any college could have, and 
Maryville had much of it, for its founders were pre- 
eminently men of prayer. This capital, then, Mary- 
ville had to begin with, when beginning life all over, 
in the middle Sixties. Salvage worth while, indeed, 
was this precious capital saved from the wreckage of 
the past. 
The miracle of modern Maryville came about partly 
because God was mindful of the foundations and 
achievements and endowments contributed by Isaac 
Anderson and his colleagues to the ante-bellum Mary- Significant

ville. But God was also mindful of the royal spirit 
of eager service on the part of Professor Lamar and 
of the noble colleagues whom, as time went on, he 
gathered around him. 
Professor Lamar was thoroughly imbued with the 
spirit of Maryville. Born in Jefferson County on 
- ‘Te’ November 21, 1826, he spent his 
cme Poni tar earliest school-days at Holston 
Academy in New Market; and 
then the years 1844-1848 in Maryville, where he took 
the Bachelor’s degree in 1848; he studied divinity one 
year in the theological department at Maryville; and 
then took the three years’ course at Union Theological 
Seminary in New York City, graduating there in 
1852. He was one of the best educated of the ante- 
bellum Maryville men. He was licensed to preach by 
the Presbytery of Brooklyn in 1852; and in 1854 he 
was ordained to the ministry by the Presbytery of 
Lexington, Missouri. 
In 1856 he was chosen Professor of Sacred Litera- 
ture in his alma mater, and began to serve in 1857. 
His spirit was chastened by the death of his wife 
about the beginning of the War, and by twelve years 
of devoted care for his invalid daughter. He developed 
a rare spirit of unselfishness. He felt called to the 
mission of rebuilding Maryville College. His firm 
convictions and his high sense of duty made him a 
Rock of Gibraltar in those troublous times. His states- 
manship, remarkable for its far-sightedness, showed 
itself in his leadership of the causes he espoused. His 
genius of perseverance and dogged persistence were
-P-A-G-E-165
  COLLEGE RUINS—1865-1869 125 
a rich asset of the College in those days of making 
bricks without straw. And, with it all, he was the 
most modest of men. All the persuasion of his friends 
could not induce him to accept the degree of Doctor 
of Divinity conferred upon him by Wooster Uni- 
versity ; he modestly declined the honor. So vital was 
his part in the reviving of Maryville that many of 
the friends of the institution came to regard him as 
the chief endowment of the College. 
The little faculty began to grow. Professor Lamar, 
as we have seen, was the charter member. He gradu- 
Bc Fel ally gathered around him a small 
His First but able body of colaborers. His Colaborers far-sightedness and accurate esti- 
mates of character were illustrated in the choices he 
made. The first professor added was Rév. Alexander 
Bartlett, who began in October, 1867, a notable service 
of sixteen years. His chair was that of Latin, but 
he taught in several departments. His colleagues used 
to say that his scholarship was so general and so 
thorough and his genius so versatile that there was 
hardly a course of study given in the institution that 
he could not have satisfactorily conducted. His stu- 
dents felt the profoundest respect for his learning, 
his industry, his kindliness, and his sterling Christian 
character. His sudden and lamented death occurred 
on November 19, 1883. His brother, Rev. P. Mason 
Bartlett, D.D., did not begin his active service until 
in March, 1869. Special mention of his work belongs 
to the next two chapters. 
The recitations were held in the old brick barracks
-P-A-G-E-166

for about four years. This was done in spite of the 
fact that a committee of the Directors had reported 
that the building could be made 
safe only by removing the third 
story and placing the roof on the 
second story. Some of the students even ventured, 
although with much trepidation, to room on the sec- 
ond floor of the ruin. With admirable forethought, 
they selected the limbs of the adjoining trees to which 
they would leap when the walls should begin to col- 
lapse! One Sabbath afternoon in the spring of 1870, 
when no one was in the building, there was a sudden 
roar and a crash; a large segment of the wall facing 
Main Street had buckled out and collapsed in ruins. 
The building was then abandoned, torn down, and 
removed, and Maryville College started on its travels. 
It had already removed part of its work eastward half 
a block to the old boarding-house, a little frame build- 
ing that stood on Church Street, where now the Sec- 
ond Presbyterian Church stands. Here and in a little 
house at the west corner of Main and College Streets 
the College kept its humble state until the following 
October, 
Meanwhile, William Thaw, of Pittsburgh, John 
Center Baldwin, of New York, and other friends be- 
came interested in the College; and 
sufficient funds were secured to 
realize the dream of a decade 
earlier in the purchase of a new campus on the hills 
to the east of town, and the erection of college build- 
ings thereupon. At first sixty-five acres were pur- Clearing Away

chased; but later on additional purchases were made, 
increasing the campus to its present broad extent of 
two hundred and fifty acres, as noble a domain as 
any college could desire. 
The first building erected on the new college grounds 
was a residence for Professor Bartlett, located in the 
edge of the woods; it was built in 1868. The follow- 
ing year the foundation of the new college building, 
Anderson Hall, was laid on what now took the name 
College Hill; and Maryville’s friends rejoiced that the 
ruins were disappearing, and that instead there was 
arising, Phoenix-like, a new and greater Maryville.

  CHAPTER II 
CoLLEGE RE-CREATION—1869-1880 
THE rebuilding of the political institutions of the 
South after the Civil War was styled their “recon- 
struction,” a term that came to 
have an unhappy signification. In 
the case of the remaking of 
Maryville College, after its destruction by the War, 
the word “reconstruction” can hardly be used with 
propriety, for there was too little salvage to provide 
any building material. It was a re-creation and not 
a reconstruction that took place. The work of found- 
ing the College had to be done a second time. The 
work of the founder had now to be supplemented by 
that of a refounder; the “days of creation” of which 
a former chapter treated had now to be followed 
by days of re-creation. It might be reconstruction in 
the South at large, but it must be re-creation in the 
case of Maryville. 
In the fall of 1868 Rev. P. Mason Bartlett, D.D., 
LL.D., was elected president of the College; and in 
March, 1869, he entered upon the 
ete te discharge of the duties of his of- 
fice. In the announcement of the 
opening of the College in 1866 his name had appeared 
128 Re-creation, not

as teacher of Mathematics with that of Professor La- 
mar, who was to be teacher of Languages, but he did 
not begin his work in the College until nearly three 
years later. He was born in Salisbury, Connecticut, 
on February 6, 1820, and graduated from Williams 
College in the Class of 1850, and from Union Theo- 
logical Seminary in the Class of 1853. In the Semi- 
nary he began his lifelong friendship for Professor 
Lamar who was a member of the Class of 1852. He 
served in the ministry in Ohio and in New York from 
1853 to 1861; was chaplain in the United States Army 
from 1862 to 1864; and served in the ministry in 
Massachusetts and Connecticut from 1864 to 1868. 
He was president of Maryville College for a term 
of eighteen years. Besides performing the many and 
varied duties of president, he regularly conducted all 
the courses of study pursued by the Senior Class. 
Those courses were also many and varied, the curric- 
ulum comparing favorably with that of any small col- 
lege of those days. Dr. Bartlett was a very versatile 
teacher, and was especially strong in philosophy and 
psychology. At the same time, he was also of an emi- 
nently practical‘turn of mind. As chairman of the 
building committee charged with the erection of the 
three new buildings, he served with the efficiency of 
a skilled architect and builder. The present soundness 
and serviceability of these old buildings is an eloquent 
testimonial to his skill and fidelity in the oversight of 
their erection. And he was also a builder of such per- 
manent spiritual institutions as the Tuesday Evening 
Conference and the February Meetings; for both these 
 
-P-A-G-E-172

characteristic Maryville institutions were established 
during his presidency. 
Dr. Bartlett was a man of robust physique, and of 
soldierly carriage and bearing. He was full of energy 
and enthusiasm, and was an able and eloquent speaker. 
In addition to his work in the College, he preached 
often throughout East Tennessee. He served as presi- 
dent of the Bank of Maryville from its founding till 
the time of his death, which took place on October 22, 
IgOI. 
The trio, President Bartlett and Professors Lamar 
and Bartlett, had heavy burdens of administration and 
instruction to bear, and usually had 
bl c ry only one or two assistants besides 
Fourth Professor Some student helpers. In 1874, 
Rev. Gideon S. W. Crawford be- 
came a tutor, and the next year was made full pro- 
fessor of mathematics; and so the trio became a quar- 
tette. His services, like those of Professor Bartlett, 
extended through sixteen years, during which time he 
bore his share of the many and heavy burdens of the 
institution. He was one of the original thirteen stu- 
dents. He entered in 1866, and graduated in 1871. 
At the call of his alma mater, he returned to her ser- 
vice after three years, two of which were spent in 
Union Theological Seminary and one in Lane Theo- 
logical Seminary. He was one of the worthiest sons 
of the College, and gave to it unstintedly of his accu- 
rate scholarship and loyal endeavor. During the years 
1882-1883 he served the State of Tennessee as Super- 
intendent of Public Instruction. He was Stated

Clerk of the Synod of Tennessee during the last four 
years of his life. His early death in I89I was a 
calamity to the College. In 1912 friends established 
a Crawford Self-Help Fund in his memory. 
The writer recited for five years to these four 
earliest post-bellum professors, and, as he recalls their 
scholarly equipment and methods, he is at once proud 
and personally thankful that the renascent Maryville 
of the Seventies could boast such an able and thorough- 
going faculty. 
In the spring of 1869, there were enough funds 
pledged by the new friends of the College to warrant 
the Directors in ordering, as they 
oe aga a did, the erection, on the new cam- 
Memorial Halls Pus» Of what they styled “the col- 
lege edifice,’ a three-story brick 
building to be called Anderson Hall. It was to cost 
about twenty-five thousand dollars—more than two 
and a half times what the former main building, its 
prototype, had cost. The new president, who had just 
arrived, took charge of the work, and within eighteen 
months had the satisfaction of seeing Anderson Hall 
completed. An epochal event it was when the college 
classrooms were transferred from the weather-beaten 
little one-story building on Church Street to the un- 
precedented grandeur of the spacious and substantial 
building on College Hill! 
But even greater days were coming, for more money 
had been promised, and two dormitories were decided 
upon. In 1870 Memorial and Baldwin Halls were be- 
gun; both of them were completed in time for use in
-P-A-G-E-176
  13@ A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
1871. Memorial Hall commemorated in its name the 
union of the Old and New School Presbyterian 
Churches, while Baldwin Hall was named for John 
Center Baldwin, the first large giver to Maryville, who 
contributed the princely sum of $25,400 to the erection 
of the new buildings. Unlike Anderson Hall, these 
halls were frame buildings, but right stately they 
seemed to those who had been living amid ruins only a 
few months before. They provided, besides accommo- 
dations for a college boarding hall, rooms for one hun- 
dred and thirty students, a larger number than was 
ever enrolled before the War. When the three build- 
ings in imposing line crowned College Hill, the old 
friends of Maryville rejoiced at the surpassing miracle 
that met their eyes.

later, a spacious and beautiful campus, adorned with

sor’s residence at the edge of the 
woods. In 1867, at the end of the first year, there was 
a college department of two students—one Sophomore 
and one Junior; and forty-three preparatory depart- 
ment students. In 1871, at the end of the fifth year, a 
class of five promising young men graduated; the col- 
lege department numbered seventeen, while the pre- 
paratory department and the young women’s depart- 
ment together numbered eighty-three, making a total 
of an even hundred. The College was already in 
equipment immeasurably in advance of the old College

that the Civil War had destroyed; and even in at- 
tendance the record was already equal to the best 
record of ante-bellum days. The realization was 
already better than the wildest day-dreamer had dared 
to dream! It seemed to the old friends of Maryville, 
“thus high uplifted beyond hope,” that the millennium 
had dawned upon the College. 
Two years later, when the writer entered the Col- 
lege, he found that the students felt that they were citi- 
; zens of no mean city. Did we not 
The Glories of have three great three-story build- 
tee ings, the central, cupola-crowned one 
having cost almost as much as the 
entire property of the College amounted to in the old 
days? Did we not have a president, two professors, 
three lady teachers, one graduate tutor, namely, 
Thomas Theron Alexander, and two student teachers, 
Edgar Elmore and Monroe Goddard? And did we’ 
not enroll the unprecedented number of one hundred 
and thirty-one students? And did we not have a brick 
walk all the way from Memorial to Baldwin, where 
there was a boarding hall with fifteen boarders, and 
where there were also several basement kitchens in 
which, as in similar kitchens in Memorial, the students 
“bached” to the prejudice of their health and to the 
benefit of their pocketbooks? And did we not have 
six recitation rooms, and two society halls, and a chapel 
forty feet by fifty in size, lighted by big chandeliers of 
oil lamps? And was not our baseball team the cham- 
pion of Blount County; and could not the boys jump 
over most of the cedars on the hill, if there were any 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
  134 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
special motive to do so? And were not our rooms 
heated by stoves, and did not our axes make a merry 
ringing after three o’clock at the wood-piles back of 
the dormitories? 
And were we not as well off as most of the colleges 
in Tennessee, and better off than most, for that mat- 
ter? Do not waste your pity on 
us! We needed no one’s sym- 
pathy ; we were happy as kings and 
queens. What! pity, for example, a lad who, after 
his lessons were prepared on a winter night, could sit 
in his cosy room in Memorial Hall, and, as the wind 
whistled around the corner, could hear the fire of hick- 
ory roaring up the stovepipe, and could in such an 
Elysium read Scott and Shakespeare; or, when warm 
weather had come again, could do his share in run- 
ning up, on the ball grounds, a score of thirty or forty 
tallies—those were the days when baseball achieved 
something !—against the Crooked Creek team; or, in 
any season, in the old chapel, when the benches had 
been piled up in the corner, could play the classic game 
of “Snap” with as pretty girls as ever played havoc 
with masculine hearts! Pity, indeed! Rather pity your- 
self for what you missed by not being there! 
Thus the new-old College had settled down again to 
its work. The young people of East Tennessee were 
more in number, and also more 
-* atti Telenty anxious to get the education that 
was now having a greater value 
placed upon it than in former days; and they rallied in 
large numbers to the advantages afforded them at so “Contented with 
Little”

modest a cost by the new college on the hill. In 1880, 
fourteen years after the reopening, the total enroll- 
ment had increased until it amounted to two hundred 
students, of whom thirty-four were enrolled in the 
college department. Almost all the two hundred were 
from Blount County and the counties immediately con- 
tiguous. Evidently the immediate clientage of the 
school were eager for what Maryville was established 
to afford. 
The Seventies were years of unremitting toil, as the 
college people tried to make inadequate resources do 
k the great work that was crying to 
~ er be done. Those were also years of 
care and trouble as new adjust- 
ments were being made in the life of the nation, and 
as men, not as yet recovered from the poverty caused 
by the War, were suddenly plunged into the economic 
disturbances that were nation-wide in their extent and 
heart-racking in their effects. Lines of anxiety were 
graven in the faces of those who were responsible for 
the administration of the College. Men grew old 
rapidly during those trying days. 
The permanent endowment of the College in 1880 
amounted to only thirteen thousand dollars. The Col- 
lege was also in debt, principally to 
Te. its poorly paid professors, to the 
extent of ten thousand dollars. 
The panic of 1873 and the stringency that followed 
had cut off for several years about three thousand dol- 
lars annually which Mr. Thaw and Mr. Dodge had 
been contributing. The debt was carried mainly by
-P-A-G-E-182
  136 A CENTURY: OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
one of the professors. At last the hard times were 
relieved, and it was possible for the institution to in- 
augurate a movement toward the securing of an en- 
dowment. When the period of re-creation that we are 
considering closed, the College was confronting the 
need and the opportunity to take steps for the relief 
of the financial famine that had been afflicting the in- 
stitution. 
In the early “days of creation” of the College, as 
we have seen, Dr. Anderson had to wrestle with the 
; roblems of securing for the school 
And of Old-Time i teachers, ices. local habita- Problems Revived .. ; tion, and food and raiment, and of 
developing in the students both intellectual culture and 
moral character. All these problems presented them- 
selves again in this period of “college re-creation,” 
and demanded solution at the hands of the little band 
of brave men who were the agents in the re-creation. 
The solution of these problems was made easier by 
the new friends that had arisen to help the College do 
its work; while their solution was rendered more diffi- 
cult by the great increase in the attendance. There 
were many more to provide for than in the earlier 
days. The embarrassment caused by growth—a usual 
experience in post-bellum Maryville—was at once both 
welcome and distressing. 
Right manfully did the men of Maryville do their 
duty during these trying days of re-creation. Had 
not the refounder and his colleagues proved themselves 
the lineal and worthy descendants by apostolic suc- 
cession of the self-sacrificing founder of the College,
-P-A-G-E-183

the successes of later days could never have been real- 
ized. Their desperate and valorous trench defensive 
of those days of battle has made possible the victorious 
offensive of these later days. Or, to revert to the 
metaphor with which this chapter opened, the re-cre- 
ators of those days of beginnings have made possible 
the developed college plant which many now are pro- 
nouncing “very good.” All honor to the faithful band! 
their works follow them, and enrich us.

CHAPTER III 
CoLLEGE ENDOWMENT—1880-1884 
THE little company of men who were bearing the 
burdens of Maryville in those days found their load 
i a crushing one. Heavy, indeed, is 
at Slee the responsibility for the successful 
carrying forward of a business where financial capital 
and financial guarantors are both lacking. To be zeal- 
ously ambitious for the attainment of the very best 
results in education and yet to lack the financial ability 
necessary to attain those results is to be weighted 
down with continuous and grievous disappointment. 
To see, every day, actual students and prospective stu- 
dents in need and to be unable for lack of resources to 
follow the warm and strong impulses of the heart in 
helping them, loads no small burden on the heart. 
To have debt saddling itself, like the Old Man of the 
Sea, on the shoulders of the college that one loves, and, 
at the same time, to see unavoidable general expenses 
running up rapidly and necessarily as the result of 
the embarrassing growth of the institution is, indeed, 
to feel the weight of a crushing burden. It would 
require a Samson Agonistes to wrestle successfully 
with such problems, and truly Atlantean shoulders to 
sustain such burdens.

  COLLEGE ENDOWMENT—1880-1884 139 
As these weighty burdens of the College were rest- 
ing, to an especial degree, upon the shoulders of the 
ae second founder of the College, and 
a Jean as we see him staggering under 
jean them, but yet manfully supporting 
them, we are reminded of Victor Hugo’s description 
of a deed of heroism on the part of Jean Valjean. It 
was at the town hall of Toulon, where repairs were 
being made. Through some one’s carelessness, a cary- 
atid supporting a wall was about to fall, when Jean 
Valjean, the servant of duty, sprang forward and took 
the pillar’s place and upheld both caryatid and beam 
until the workmen could brace the beam and replace 
the pillar and thus avert the threatened catastrophe. 
So, during those days of crushing burdens, Professor 
Lamar was a Maryville Jean Valjean staggering, but 
staying under the swaying architrave. 
In the fall of 1880, realizing that a permanent en- 
dowment must be secured or the College must break 
down under its increasing load, the 
Directors of the College and the 
Synod of Tennessee united in com- 
missioning Professor Lamar as their special financial 
agent to attempt the securing of an endowment of one 
hundred thousand dollars, The amount to be sought 
was several times greater than the entire property of 
ante-bellum days; but so was the number of students 
enrolled several times greater than in those days; and 
so were the broadening opportunities of the new era 
that was beginning to dawn on the country. 
In November, 1880, Professor Lamar went to New Endowment 
Sought 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
  140 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
York, and began the difficult task of attempting to 
interest strangers in a school they had never seen and 
that was located beyond the range 
of their especial interests. That 
was before the days of large 
and generous giving to colleges. The task to be at- 
tempted seemed an impossible one, and, at best, it 
required grit and grace to persist in it. Hardly, how- 
ever, had the professor gotten well into the campaign, 
when, in December, he was summoned home by the 
fatal illness of his only child. He buried the little 
boy; and resolute even under this heart-breaking sor- 
row, he returned in January, 1881, to New York, and 
took up again his really appalling task. 
Within a month the three generous and never-to-be- 
forgotten friends who had been contributing for many 
years to the annual expenses of the institution, made 
subscriptions aggregating sixty-five thousand dollars: 
William E. Dodge subscribing $25,000; William Thaw, 
$20,000; and Preserved Smith, $20,000. 
These remarkably liberal subscriptions greatly 
cheered the friends of Maryville. But these three 
donors were already interested in the College ; and new 
friends were hard to make. It was still a long way to 
the completion of the one hundred thousand dollar 
fund. 
As is often the case with those that are successful 
in securing large sums of money for benevolent enter- 
prises, Professor Lamar found the task of soliciting 
help a most distasteful one, and one even positively 
obnoxious to his retiring and modest nature. But he The Weary Years | 
of Strain

persisted in his work most conscientiously, in the face 
of numberless disappointments. As has been said, 
that was before the day of gener- 
raid vere ous giving to colleges, and it was 
almost impossible to make any 
headway. During the endowment campaign, which 
ended on the last day of the year 1883, the professor 
spent fifteen months in active service on the field. 
Often the task seemed a hopeless one, and hope de- 
ferred made the heart sick. As the Directors after- 
ward said of this crisis: ““The College hung in dread- 
ful suspense between life and death.” On the first 
of November, 1883, Professor Lamar returned to New 
York for the final effort. On the nineteenth of the 
same month, Professor Alexander Bartlett died sud- 
denly at Maryville. But while the workers fall, the 
work must go on. 
During the final month, as, indeed, throughout the 
entire campaign, Professor Lamar received invaluable 
support and assistance from the 
three principal donors to the fund, 
and from Rev. Drs. Thomas S. 
Hastings, Henry Kendall, Edward D. Morris, and 
Henry A. Nelson. On December 31, 1883, the last 
day of grace for the conditional subscription, Profes- 
sor Lamar sat in great anxiety in Dr. Kendall’s office 
in New York City. Mr. Smith had increased his sub- 
scription to $25,000; Mr. Dodge had died, but his 
family were ready to pay his subscription of $25,000; 
Dr. Sylvester Willard had subscribed $5,000; the 
Maryville alumni and the friends in Tennessee, $5,000 ; The Final 
Achievement 
 
-P-A-G-E-190

the West Presbyterian Church of New York, $4,000; 
and the Marquand Estate, $1,000. The total of the 
subscriptions was $90,000, and “the last stone had been 
turned.” While Professor Lamar sat there, having 
done all that man could do, telegrams were handed him 
that announced the consummation of his toils and 
prayers; they were from Mr. Thaw and Dr. Willard, 
each subscribing an additional $5,000, in order to com- 
plete the one hundred thousand dollar endowment! 
The good friends whose names have here been recited 
had lifted the swaying walls back to their place off the 
shoulders of the heavy-laden man of Maryville. 
So long as Maryville shall continue, the names of 
the donors who kept it alive when otherwise it would 
have died, and who then gave it its 
William Thaw first substantial endowment, should 
ma ee E. be held in grateful remembrance. 
s Let their names, together with 
those of Professor Lamar and his associates, stand 
first on the bead-roll of the post-bellum worthies that 
shall be forever honored on Founders’ Day. 
Mr. William Thaw, of Pittsburgh, might well be 
termed the dean of these early donors. As early as 
October 14, 1867, he sent his first gift of $1,000, which, 
two days later, was expended, together with a note for 
$691.50, in purchase of the new campus to which the 
College was now to be removed. The following year 
he contributed $3,000, and from that time onward until 
his death, in 1889, twenty-two years later, he contrib- 
uted often and liberally to the College. And he gave 
much more than mere money. When he passed away,

the Directors said of him: “In his death the College 
has lost one of its greatest benefactors and wisest 
counsellors. He gave in money the generous sum of 
more than $60,000, but the value of his advice, hearty 
interest, and constant encouragement through all these 
years of struggle can not be estimated. Under the 
providence of God, Maryville College is what it is 
to-day, and will be what it hopes to become in the 
future, largely through him.” 
Hon. William E. Dodge, of New York, gave almost 
the only contribution that Professor Lamar received 
during his first trip taken in the interests of the Col- 
lege, in 1866; and a few years later he joined Mr. 
Thaw in making the annual contributions to the cur- 
rent expenses of the College which kept the institution 
alive in those days of no endowment. During thirteen 
years he gave the College the sum of ten thousand five 
hundred dollars. In 1881 he made the subscription 
that started the endowment campaign, very enthusi- 
astically promising twenty-five thousand dollars, or 
one quarter of the entire amount sought. With his 
own hand he wrote the following subscription in Pro- 
fessor Lamar’s book, saying that he hoped it would also 
lead others to give: “Having been for the past fifteen 
years contributing to the annual expenses of Maryville 
College, and having watched with deep interest the 
self-denying efforts and success of its teachers, and 
being convinced that the time has come when it should 
have a permanent enlargement, I hereby subscribe the 
sum opposite my name (twenty-five thousand dollars), 
 
-P-A-G-E-194
144 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
provided that during the year the amount is made up 
to a hundred thousand.” 
Mr. Preserved Smith, a substantial business man of 
Dayton, Ohio, had already put a provision in his will 
: that Maryville should receive from 
Preserved Smith his Stine sum of $20,000. He and Sylvester i Willard, M.D. now, however, pledged this $20,000 
to be paid whenever the entire 
$100,000 should be pledged. Later on in the campaign 
he increased his pledge to $25,000. Mr. Smith was 
the only one of the quartette of principal donors to 
the endowment fund who ever visited the College; but 
all of them became very intimately and sympathetically 
acquainted with the history and management of the 
institution. — 
The fourth donor was Sylvester Willard, M.D., a 
prominent and wealthy physician of Auburn, N. Y. 
As we have seen, he subscribed $10,000 to the endow- 
ment. He took an especial pleasure in the fact that 
his final investment of $5,000 secured $95,000 addi- 
tional to the College. 
These four gentlemen, who in so decisive and far- 
reaching a way proved their faith in the present and 
future of Maryville College, were all of them ap- 
proaching the end of life, and desired to place Mary- 
ville on a safe basis for the future. By contributing 
the large sums they gave, they effected their purpose. 
Before the decade had closed during which the endow- 
ment was subscribed and paid, not only these four gen- 
erous friends, but also Professor Lamar, through 
whom they made their gifts, had all passed into the
-P-A-G-E-195
  
COLLEGE ENDOWMENT—1880-1884 145 
eternal life. And their fruitful investments in Mary- 
ville and in Maryville’s youth are every year yielding 
to the world—who can compute how many rich re- 
turns? 
A stupendous victory was the securing of the endow- 
ment! An additional annual income of six thousand 
dollars was now assured. And a 
new sense of security and per- 
manence came with the endowment. 
There could be no doubt now that Maryville had come 
back to stay and to advance throughout the future. 
A great amount at any time, one hundred thousand 
dollars meant far more in those days of re-creation and 
beginnings than in these later days of national pros- 
perity and of college expansion. It was an epoch- 
marking event. Well did Dr. Carson W. Adams con- 
gratulate our Jean Valjean upon his great service to 
Maryville: “I rejoice with you over your great suc- 
cess. Will, patience, perseverance, and faith do ac- 
complish great things. You are the second father of 
the College. Your name must in all the future be 
coupled with that of Dr. Anderson. What a witness 
to the power of quiet, persistent energy over fuss and 
feathers, your success is!” 
A significant item in the final report of the endow- 
ment campaign is that which states that the expenses 
of Professor Lamar during his fif- 
teen months of work for the fund 
amounted to only seven hundred 
dollars. An inexpensive victory, then, was it? A no- 
table victory, indeed, it was, but it was vastly expen- A Decisive

sive; it was won by the loss of the leader. For many 
years Professor Lamar’s health had been somewhat 
feeble, but now he began to decline rapidly. His work 
in the classroom closed at the commencement of 1886. 
For ten months he was confined to his room, his vital 
forces slowly ebbing away. On Sabbath morning, 
March 20, 1887, his earthly service closed. The reso- 
lutions adopted by the Directors said of him: “By 
his death the College lost its greatest friend, this Board 
its wisest counsellor, and the entire community one of 
its best and most useful citizens.’”’ His body sleeps in 
the quiet of the college cemetery at the border of the 
woodland. The inscription on his monument says that 
he was “for thirty years a professor in Maryville Col- 
lege, his most enduring monument.” 
Soon after the death of Professor Lamar, Mr. Thaw 
led in the movement for the erection of a library to 
be a memorial of the departed pro- 
fessor. Toward this Lamar Me- 
morial Library building Mr. Thaw 
contributed three thousand dollars, and Mrs. William 
E. Dodge and Mrs. Dr. Sylvester Willard one thou- 
sand dollars each; while the brothers and sisters of 
Professor Lamar added a beautiful memorial window 
costing five hundred dollars. A very appropriate me- 
morial was this brick building with its inside finishing 
of oak, for this man with his “heart of oak.” It is, 
doubtless, what he himself would have chosen. The 
writer had spent some months in classifying the books 
of the college library and had arranged them on new 
shelving in the largest available room in Anderson The Lamar

Hall. Professor Lamar was greatly pleased with what 
had been done, and upon his last visit to the library 
told the writer that as soon as he improved in health 
he would make a trip to secure funds for a library 
building. But others had to erect the building. 
Twenty-one years later, Mrs. Lamar, at an expendi- 
ture of six thousand dollars, erected the Ralph Max 
Lamar Memorial Hospital as a memorial of the little 
boy who died during the endowment campaign. Thus 
both father and son have their fitting memorials on 
the college hill. 
The chief memorial of Professor Lamar, however, 
as his monument declares, was found in Maryville 
College—in Maryville’s great cam- 
ai pus, its four buildings, its endow- 
ment of $113,000, and its enroll- 
ment, at the time of his death, of nearly three hun- 
dred students. Others had contributed largely and 
efficiently to this greater Maryville, but to him more 
than to others Providence had allotted the responsible 
and arduous task of reviving the College and of financ- 
ing it in its mighty struggle for existence during those 
years of want and uncertainty. He did not live to 
enjoy very long the larger days that he had done so 
much to bring about; but, dying, he left a memorial 
to his heroic career that had in it the potency of an 
ever-widening useful service to God and man.

CHAPTER IV 
CoLLEGE EvoLuTION—1884-I1901 
THE progress during the next fifteen years was very 
steady and gratifying. It was, on the one hand, the 
result of the excellent work done 
by the hard-toiling management; 
and, on the other hand, it was the 
natural outworking of the new resources afforded by 
the hundred thousand dollars of endowment and by 
the Fayerweather bequest, of which fund mention will 
soon be made. What had been hoped for in the way 
of increased attendance was realized. The College 
attracted to it a large body of students, and grew to 
proportions and to an importance hitherto unknown in 
its history; and yet it did all this in that quiet and 
unostentatious way that has always characterized the 
advance of Maryville. It was a natural and healthy 
evolution, and not a forced and unnatural hothouse 
growth. In 1880 the attendance was two hundred; 
by 1890, it was three hundred; and by 1900, it was 
four hundred. 
This growth in numbers was occasioned by the 
growth of the courses of study and of the teaching 
force and of other advantages to the student body that 
had been made possible by the increased capital of the Evolution Caused 
by Endowment 
148 
   
-P-A-G-E-201

College. In 1884 there were, all told, four professors 
and four assistants. In 1901 there were five profes- 
sors, four acting professors, seven 
assistant teachers giving their en- 
tire time to teaching, two stu- 
dent assistants, and one matron, besides two man- 
agers of the Cooperative Boarding Club. The changes 
in courses offered were principally changes in the num- 
ber and variety of courses, but there were also im- 
portant changes in the methods of their presentation. 
The first new chair established as the result of the 
Lamar endowment was that of the English Language 
and Literature, to which chair the writer was called 
in 1884. The next new chair was that of the Natural 
Sciences in 1887, which was divided, in 1899, into the 
chairs of Chemistry and Biology. In 1889 the first 
post-bellum required Bible study was conducted by the 
writer. In 1892 Dr. Barnes became the first Principal 
of the Preparatory Department. In 1899 the Expres- 
sion Department began its useful career. And there 
were many other important improvements made in the 
already established courses and departments. 
Following Dr. Bartlett’s resignation in 1887, there 
were, as there had been before his election to the 
; presidency, two years during which 
ma of the the College was administered by a 
Chairman of the Faculty. Profes- 
sor Edgar ‘A. Elmore served during the year 1887- 
1888, resigning at the close of that year to reenter the 
pastorate. He had been a member of the faculty for 
four years. His valuable services to the College did Development of 
Course and Force

not, however, cease with the termination of his mem- 
bership in the faculty. From 1897 until his removal 
from Knoxville to Chattanooga in 1900 he served on 
the Executive Committee of the Directors of the Col- 
lege ; and in 1906 he was elected to succeed Rev. Wil- 
liam H. Lyle, D.D., as Chairman of the Directors. 
Dr. Lyle, an alumnus of the class of 1861, was always 
one of the most loyal champions of Maryville, and 
served as a director for forty years, and as Chairman 
of the Directors for fifteen years. He died on August 
II, 1905. In the year 1888-1889 Rev. James E. 
Rogers, Ph.D., was Chairman of the Faculty. He 
resigned at the end of the year to enter Y. M. C. A. 
work. 
On January 17, 1889, Rev. Samuel Ward Boardman, 
D.D., LL.D., then of New Jersey, was elected to the 
presidency of the institution. In 
a 2 February he visited the College and 
took part in a remarkable series of 
February meetings. He entered upon the presidency 
in the fall of 1889, and from that time until his resig- 
nation, in 1901, his heart was in the work that he had 
at the very beginning found to be so congenial to his 
earnest nature. Born in Pittsford, Vermont, in 1830, 
and educated in Middlebury College and in Andover 
Theological Seminary, he had spent most of his life 
in the pastorate in New York and New Jersey, al- 
though he had served for two years as Professor of 
Rhetoric and English Literature and Intellectual Phil- 
osophy in Middlebury College. His work of instruc- 
tion at Maryville was principally in psychology and

philosophy. He found himself in deep sympathy with 
the character-forming ideals of Maryville, and used 
every endeavor toward the conserving and realizing 
of those ideals. 
Dr. Boardman had been a neighbor of Sylvester 
Willard, M.D., in Auburn, New York, for many years; 
_. and the interest of the Willard 
oe Memorial, family followed him in his removal 
to Maryville, where, as we have 
seen, Dr. Willard already had made an investment. 
As a further token of interest in the College and 
especially in its new president, and as a memorial of 
Dr. Willard, Mrs. Jane F. Willard contributed eleven 
thousand dollars to erect the very comfortable and 
commodious brick residence that serves as the home 
of the president of the College. It occupies one of 
the best of the many attractive sites on the campus, 
and commands excellent views of the Cumberlands 
sixty miles to the west and of the Great Smokies 
forty miles to the east. The building was first oc- 
cupied by Dr. Boardman in December, I8go. 
There befell the College at this epoch a transcendent 
providence which gave the institution an impetus for- 
ward that contributed greatly to its 
The Fayerweather reputation and efficiency. Mr. Providence, : 1891-1907 Daniel B. Fayerweather, a wealthy 
leather merchant of New York, 
counselled by Rev. Roswell D. Hitchcock, D.D., who 
had been acquainted with Professor Lamar during 
his endowment campaign, included Maryville in a list 
of twenty colleges, to which he bequeathed most of 
 
-P-A-G-E-206
  152 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
his estate. The property was in litigation for four- 
teen years, but during this weary period it grew im- 
mensely in value, in spite of the court expenses. 
Large amounts were paid the College from time to 
time during the years, until, by the date of the final 
settlement, at the end of sixteen years, instead of 
the $100,000 originally bequeathed, the College had 
received the magnificent sum of $216,572 from the 
estate. 
This godsend came to the College unheralded and 
unexpected, and yet proved to be larger in amount 
than was all the property that the 
Lo ener ee institution had owned up to that 
time. The rapid growth of the Col- 
lege occasioned by the securing of the Lamar en- 
dowment could not have been properly met had not 
this most opportune windfall come to the institution. 
Fortunately, the bequest was unrestricted in its pro- 
visions, and so the fund could be used in erecting 
buildings, in meeting current expenses, or in forming 
endowment. The Directors were very judicious in 
the expenditure of the fund made available by the 
bequest, and wisely assigned a large part of it to the 
permanent endowment fund. Considerable amounts 
were invested in equipment and permanent improve- 
ments, while smaller sums were, from time to time, 
assigned to the current expense fund. 
The Fayerweather fund made possible certain ad- 
ditions to the college plant that were necessary, and 
that yet could not otherwise have been provided. In 
1892 an annex, forty feet by ninety, nearly doubling
-P-A-G-E-207
  COLLEGE EVOLUTION—1884-1901 153 
the capacity of the original building, was added to An- 
derson Hall, at a cost of twelve thousand dollars. 
This structure provided many new 
‘salen recitation rooms and nearly doubled 
Improvements the size of the chapel. It was 
called the Fayerweather Annex. | 
In 1892 a careful topographical survey of the cam-. 
pus was made by a civil engineer, and a map of the 
grounds was drafted. The locations of the buildings 
erected since that time have been decided upon with 
reference to this map. In 1893 the many stoves and 
the furnace that had heated the buildings were sup- 
planted by the installation of a general heating plant. 
In the same year electric light was first used in the 
college buildings. At first it was secured from the 
Maryville plant; but in 1901 the College installed 
its own electric light plant. In Igor also the laun- 
dry building was erected. 
The overflow of students at Baldwin Hall made it 
necessary in several successive years to rent residences 
in town to be used as annexes for the accommodation 
of the young women that were crowded out of the 
hall, This, however, was not a satisfactory arrange- 
ment, and so in 1895 an annex containing a large 
dining hall, forty feet by seventy-five, and twenty- 
four additional dormitory rooms, was added to Bald- 
win Hall. The $2,000 that this annex cost was se- 
cured by Dr. Boardman in a trip to the East, and the 
addition was named “The Boardman Annex.” The 
continued growth of the Cooperative Club and the 
continued increase of students made necessary in
-P-A-G-E-208
  1s4 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
1904 an extension of this annex, measuring forty 
feet by forty-five, and adding twelve more rooms, and 
extending the dining room until it was one hundred 
and twenty feet long. 
In 1898 the beautiful and commodious two-story 
Fayerweather Science Hall was erected at a cost of 
only twelve thousand dollars. Like 
most of Maryville’s buildings, it 
was well worth twice the cost. A 
gas plant was also installed, and laboratory equip- 
ment for chemistry, biology, physics, geology, and 
psychology was purchased at the cost of about ten 
thousand dollars. All these and other permanent im- 
provements were made possible by the munificent 
Fayerweather bequest. The bequest relieved the pres- 
ent and assured the future of the College. It was of 
incalculable benefit. 
In 1888 there came to Maryville College a seven- 
teen-year-old Japanese boy in search of an American 
education. He spent the following 
ae Rare seven years at Maryville, gradu- 
ating in 1895. He possessed a truly 
marvelous natural endowment of initiative, adaptation, 
and energy. For example, he turned his talents to 
many varieties of work, from cooking to lecturing, 
in earning his own expenses. It was not long until he 
had won for himself the unquestioned position of 
student leader in the College. Although he had a 
Shintoist father and a Buddhist mother, both of whom 
were hostile to Christianity, and who had thrown 
him on his own resources when he became a Christian, Fayerweather

he early developed into one of the most effective lead- 
ers among the Christian young men of the College. 
He was a born organizer in religious activities as 
elsewhere. 
A leader in athletics, he was Maryville’s first foot- 
ball captain. Although he was only five feet two 
inches tall and weighed only one hundred and twenty- 
three pounds, he led his team to many a victory. Mil- 
ton’s description of the emmet would well apply to 
him: “In small room, large heart enclosed.” It was 
before the days of athletic coaches, but he marshalled 
his team in his room and worked out before them the 
theory of his plays, illustrating them by moving grains 
of corn on the diagram of a gridiron outlined on his 
table. He was also accustomed to offer a prayer 
with his team just before they went out on the field. 
He believed in preparedness. 
For several years a news-gatherer for local papers, 
he himself issued occasional college publications, en- 
titled College Days, which reflected great credit 
upon his editorial ability. The movement for a stu- 
dents’ self-help work fund was originated by him. He 
knew no such thing as defeat. When what seemed 
defeat befell his enterprises, he would smile and say: 
“Well, boys, we'll try again,” and that time he would 
usually make his “touch-down.” The boys called him 
“Kentucky Hossie,” and, in accord with his name, he 
pranced his way to victory. 
His most notable service to the College was the 
building of the Gymnasium and Y. M. C. A. Hall. He

was vitally interested in both athletics and character, 
and so he decided that he would show his gratitude to

oo. ma “The College has done so much for

America has done so much for 
my country, that I, as a Japanese, want to do some- 
thing to show my gratitude.” He began the campaign 
for the building in March, 1894, more than a year 
before he graduated. By the time of his graduation 
he had collected some money; and in June, 1895, he 
began to make the brick for the building by student 
labor. The college boys under his leadership made 
more than three hundred thousand good bricks at a 
cost of only $1,300. Farmers near by gave the wood to 
burn the three kilns. 
During the fall and winter he devoted himself, with- 
out salary, to the task of soliciting funds for the build- 
ing; and in the summer of 1896 he was able to lay 
the foundation. He spent another year in the field, 
and was then able to erect the walls of the building. 
During the two years so generously given to his alma 
mater, he had secured subscriptions for more than 
$7,000, $2,500 of which amount was subscribed by 
Mrs. Nettie F. McCormick. Thus assured that the 
building would certainly be completed, he returned to 
his native land to take up his life-work. Here he en- 
gaged with great success in the Y. M. C. A. work in 
Tokio; but ere long his health broke down. 
Others, meanwhile, took up the work of building

Bartlett Hall, and in 1899 the College appropriated 
$4,000 of the Fayerweather fund to complete it. About 
$9,000 was contributed by Kin’s subscribers and others, 
and the building was entirely occupied by 1901. In 
1911 Mrs. Elizabeth R. Voorhees contributed $3,000, 
which was used in greatly improving the building and 
in enlarging its equipment. Although the building 
cost only $16,000, it also is worth twice that sum. It 
is a worthy monument to the Christian love and grati- 
tude and zeal of its founder. 
The writer turns aside from the story of the Col- 
lege long enough to say that the life of Kin Takahashi 
was not only romantic but in the 
highest degree heroic. When Kin 
broke down in health he went to 
Hirao to live with his relatives. There he suffered 
for long months and very acutely. Finally, he im- 
proved somewhat. He could no longer endure his 
enforced inaction. He wrote a friend: “I determined 
to die, if need be, doing something for Christ, and 
so I formed a class of four boys in my bedroom. At 
first I was to teach one hour, and then give a short 
talk each day. But the boys usually stayed for hours 
discussing the subjects I introduced. As the mem- 
bers of the class increased in number, I organized a 
literary society, and taught them how to speak and 
debate after the dear old Maryville style. The popu- 
larity of the society immensely increased.” The num- 
ber of its members so multiplied that there was not 
room in the house for them. 
Kin’s physician forbade so much work; so Kin or- The Heroism of

ganized a “regular middle” school with nine teachers. 
The school opened the second year with one hundred 
and sixteen pupils, representing all parts of the prov- 
ince. A missionary whom Kin invited to visit the 
school found an audience of one thousand persons 
gathered at a public entertainment that Kin had 
planned. 
In the midst of excruciating suffering Kin expressed 
his Christian confidence that “all things work together 
for good to them that love God”; and he planned on 
and toiled on. In the early morning of May 7, 1902, 
he passed away while asleep. The missionary whom 
Kin had asked to conduct his. funeral found—and the 
town was not a large one—three hundred of the prin- 
cipal people gathered at the home, while the streets 
were lined by hundreds, and on the hillside about the 
grave an audience of one thousand was awaiting the 
procession. Yes, Kin was a hero; he fought a good 
fight ; he kept the faith; and, doubtless, now he wears 
a crown.

  CHAPTER V 
CoLLEGE ExPpANSION—IQOI-IQIQ 
In May, 1901, the writer was elected president of 
the College, and was formally inaugurated on Octo- 
. ber 21. As a fifteen-year-old lad, 
a et he entered the Senior Preparatory 
Class at Maryville in the autumn 
of 1873, and graduated from the College in 1878. He 
spent the years 1879-1882 as a student in Lane Theo- 
logical Seminary; and the years 1882-1884 in Mexico 
as a missionary. Born in Homs, Syria, of foreign- 
missionary parents, he had planned to spend his life 
in the foreign field. Repeated attacks of coast fever 
in Mexico, however, so undermined his health as both 
to send him back home in March, 1884, and to make 
it impossible for him to secure reappointment. In 
May, 1884, he was elected professor of the English 
Language and Literature, and of the Spanish Lan- 
guage, in Maryville College; and in June, 1891, he was 
appointed dean of the College Department. 
The healthful evolution of the College as recounted 
in the preceding chapter was both encouraging and 
embarrassing. The endowment secured by Professor 
Lamar and that contributed by Mr. Fayerweather were 
needed by the College in order to be able to administer 
159
-P-A-G-E-220
  160 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
adequately the work already in existence. But the im- 
petus they gave to the further development of the 
institution called for a still further and correspond- 
ing enlargement of the endowment 
and of the plant. The rapid evolu- 
tion of the seventeen years, begin- 
ning with 1884, now rendered absolutely necessary a 
consequent expansion on no small scale. The swarming 
students of Maryville uttered a plaint similar to that 
which the sons of the prophets made to Elisha: “Be- 
hold now, the place where we dwell with thee is too 
strait for us.” There must be expansion, enlarge- 
ment, and increased facilities in view of increased 
demands. The duty of the hour was not one to be de- 
cided upon; it was rather one simply to be recognized 
and acted upon. In Milton’s phrase, “War hath de- 
termined us.” 
The endowments of 1884 and of the Fayerweather 
bequest had now been assimilated thoroughly into the 
: life of the College; but the rapid 
ee a growth of the student body and the 
greater demands now being made 
of all colleges as to the increased number of courses 
to be offered and the greater amount of specialization 
to be provided for, made further endowment and 
equipment a most urgent need. So the new president 
was forced by the logic of events to take up the work 
of funds-finder that Professor Lamar had laid down 
in 1884. While teaching during two-thirds of the col- 
lege year, he now spent one-third of each year in the 
field attempting to enlist new friends to take part with Expansion Seen 
to Be Necessary

Maryville in its ministry of education. The collec- 
tions of the first two years were employed in removing 
two or three deficits that had accumulated. It was 
decided that no more money should be drawn from 
the Fayerweather fund for current expenses. This re- 
quired rigid adherence to a budget, and necessitated 
delay in expansion until the money for expansion had 
been secured. As a result of the carrying out of this 
policy, there have been no deficits to deal with in the 
annual reports. 
A year after the president took the field in behalf 
of the current and permanent funds of the College, 
Miss Margaret E. Henry also en- 
Roktlarchine go tered the field in the interests of 
: scholarship and self-help work 
funds, with which to help worthy and needy young 
people secure an education. Her enlistment in this 
work was the result of one of the many happy sug- 
gestions of Dean Waller that contributed so much to 
the prosperity of the College. Miss Henry was an 
alumna of the institution and thoroughly imbued with 
its spirit. Loyal in every nerve of her being, she 
entered upon the untried task with fear and trembling. 
Her success, however, was very remarkable. During 
the three months she was in the field the first year she 
secured $1,500 in gifts to her cause; and the amount 
she obtained from year to year steadily increased until, 
in 1916, it amounted to more than $15,000. 
During the thirteen years of her service as Scholar- 
ship Secretary, Miss Henry collected for the College 
the sum of $122,692 in cash. Of this magnificent
-P-A-G-E-224
162 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
amount $103,353 was contributed to current work and 
scholarship funds; $13,250 to permanent work and 
scholarship funds ; $2,698 to the salary of the college 
nurse ; $1,636 to hospital endowment; $605 to the cur- 
rent agriculture fund ; and $1,150 to hospital and other 
equipment. 
Most of Miss Henry’s life was spent in Maryville 
College. After leaving college she was a teacher until 
ie 1882, when she went to Japan as a 
ett foreign missionary. She was a 
kinswoman of Robert Moffat, the 
great missionary of Africa. She was injured in a 
storm at sea, and after about a year was compelled 
to return to her native country. After a partial re- 
covery she again began her work as teacher. In 1890 
she entered the service of her alma mater, in which 
service she continued until what seemed to be her un- 
timely death on July 7, 1916. One of the most ef- 
ficient and inspiring of teachers, she built up the schol- 
arship and moulded the character of many hundreds 
of students. 
Miss Henry’s marvelous «success as field secretary 
was due principally to five elements of strength: (1) 
Her genuine and transparent sincerity and intense 
earnestness. (2) Her deep and enthusiastic love for 
Maryville, the mountains, and the Maryville students, 
and her absolutely unselfish loyalty to their interests. 
(3) Her unceasing prayerfulness and her abiding faith 
in God’s leadership in even the details of her cam- 
paigns. (4) Her natural and heart-winning eloquence. 
Many of her hearers in many States have agreed in

declaring her the most winning and effective woman 
speaker they had ever heard. An ancestor of hers 
was a brother of the great Patrick Henry of Virginia; 
and her eloquence was certainly worthy of that great 
Virginian. (5) Her remarkable social qualities. Al- 
most every day she was the guest of some home; and 
so engaging and winning was her personality that her 
hosts became her warm and enduring friends, and 
for her they eagerly exerted their influence even year 
after year. 
The record of Miss Henry’s life of distinguished 
usefulness is one of Maryville’s imperishable treas- 
ures. Happy is the institution that can number among 
its faithful builders so devoted and brilliant a toiler 
as was our “Miss Margaret.” 
The first large gift of the period of expansion was 
that of one hundred thousand dollars made on New 
Year’s Day, 1905, by Mr. Ralph 
nae +P'4100,000 Voorhees and his wife, Mrs. Eliza- 
1905 ~~” beth R. Voorhees, of New Jersey. 
This gift illustrates for the field of 
liberality the truth of Shakespeare’s words regarding 
mercy : 
“It is twice blessed; 
It blesses him who gives, and him who takes.” 
This great benefaction was given on the annuity plan, 
and by January, 1916, there had already been paid the 
donors, at five per cent on their gift, the sum of $50,- 
000, without any delay or expense or tax. The fact 
that the College clears six per cent on its investments 
 
-P-A-G-E-228
164 A a OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
enabled it to appropriate $15,000 of this gift toward 
the erection of the sorely needed chapel. The sum 
of $85,000, then, is invested in the endowment fund, 
while $15,000 is invested in the Voorhees Chapel. 
Thus, even during the lifetime of one of the donors, 
large benefits have been derived by both donors and 
donees. | 
The chapel room provided on the second floor of An- 
derson Hall became entirely too small during the period 
of “evolution,” and, as we have 
wa Manis Han. seen, was lengthened, when the 
1906 Fayerweather Annex was built, 
until it was forty feet by ninety in 
dimensions. By 1905 the number of students in at- 
tendance had increased to six hundred; and the long, 
narrow, and low-ceilinged room was entirely inade- 
quate to accommodate so large a body. Ventilation 
was difficult, and proper acoustics was an impossi- 
bility. As is the rule at Maryville, the need of the 
new chapel was imperative before it was met. The 
$15,000 taken from the Voorhees gift, and $10,000 
contributed later on by Mrs. Voorhees, and other 
amounts added by other generous friends enabled the 
College to erect at a cost of $34,000 the large and at- 
tractive building called “The Elizabeth R. Voorhees 
Chapel.” 
The building has in its spacious auditorium a seat- 
ing capacity of nearly a thousand; while in the base- 
ment it contains seventeen well-lighted rooms, where 
the Music Department has found an abiding place 
where it can live on good terms with its neighbors;

and here, too, is a large room where the Y. W. C. A. 
has planted its lodge. To the rear of the auditorium 
are the rooms used by the Department of Expression. 
The building commands the admiration of all visitors, 
and is a delight to all the students and teachers. Its 
usefulness is a daily and manifold one. A thrilling 
sight it would be, indeed, that Isaac Anderson would 
witness were he permitted to see the eight hundred 
students and the half a hundred teachers and officers 
gathered at chapel in these closing days of the first 
century of Maryville’s career. 
By this time the College found itself again in a 
most difficult position; its popularity had far outrun 
its ability to meet the outlay de- 
The Forward manded as a consequence of that Fund of $227,000, 2 ence 1908 popularity. Its multitudinous stu- 
dent body had need of additional 
instructors, dormitories, and general college equipment, 
and the funds were inadequate to meet these crying 
needs of the College. In 1905 the president published 
a twelve-paged bulletin regarding ‘Maryville College 
—Its Field and Its Work,” in which the immediate 
needs of the College were enumerated. In 1907 the 
day-dream that a “Forward Fund of $200,000” could 
be secured to meet these needs came to the college au- 
thorities so vividly and inspiringly that a definite cam- 
paign was entered upon in an attempt to transmute 
the dream into a reality. In 1906 Mr. Carnegie had 
pledged toward additional buildings a gift of $25,000, 
on condition that $50,000 be secured from other 
 
-P-A-G-E-232
166 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
sources. This pledge provided a substantial beginning 
for the Forward Fund. 
In April, 1907, the General Education Board of 
New York made an appropriation of $50,000 to the 
College, upon the condition that a 
total of $200,000 in bona fide sub- 
scriptions be secured. This appro- 
priation gave a great impetus to the Forward Fund. 
It was one of the epochal events in the history of the 
College. Mr. Carnegie then very generously added a 
second subscription of $25,000. A total subscription 
of $100,000 had thus been secured. The near-panic 
of 1907, however, intervened, and it was impossible 
in that year to raise the second $100,000 of the fund. 
The donors kindly extended the time limit to Decem- 
ber 31, 1908, and the canvass was intermitted for the 
time. 
The campaign was reopened in 1908, and, through 
the orderings of Providence, was carried to a success- 
ful issue. In order to meet certain of the conditions 
laid down by some of the donors, it was necessary 
to raise about $225,000, instead of the $200,000 first 
proposed. A total valid subscription of $227,000 was 
reached by the expiration of the time limit. 
Among the larger gifts to the Forward Fund were 
$20,000 from Dr. Daniel K. Pearsons; $20,000 from 
Mr. John C. Martin; $10,000 from 
Mrs. William Thaw and family; 
$7,500 from Mr. Louis H. Severance; $6,000 from 
Mrs. Martha A. Lamar; and $5,000 each from Hon. 
John H. Converse, H. B. Silliman, M.D., Mr. Wm. J. The General

McCahan, Sr., and Mrs. Julia M. Turner. There were 
hundreds of smaller gifts; and almost every subscrip- 
tion was paid promptly and in full by the time limit, 
December 31, 1910. The Forward Fund was now an 
additional force coursing in the life-blood of the insti- 
tution. 
It has been the good fortune of Maryville College to 
have had associated in its faculty men and women 
who have been faithful, efficient, 
and in every way zealous in its in- 
terests. The writer pauses here in 
his story to speak of one of these loyal servants of 
Maryville whose life’s work has but recently ended. 
In the absence of the president during the Forward 
Fund Campaign and during the ten months of his 
European tour following the completion of the Fund, 
it was Dean Waller upon whom rested the responsi- 
bility for the administration of the College. 
Elmer Briton Waller was a member of the Class 
of 1882 of Union College, and of the Class of 1887 
of Princeton Theological Seminary. In 1891 he was 
elected professor of Mathematics in Maryville College, 
to succeed Professor Crawford. He held this chair for 
twenty-two years. In 1892 he was appointed secretary 
of the faculty, and in 1905 he was elected dean of the 
College. On account of his extraordinary business 
ability his services were in great demand in all direc- 
tions. 
He left his impress upon the College in many ways. 
It was he who planned and suggested the Cooperative 
Boarding Club; who suggested that Miss Henry be Services of

sent out as a college representative; who founded 
and for many years conducted the Maryville College 
Monthly; and who brought it about that free medical 
consultation be given the students at the hospital. His 
program, like Dr. Anderson’s, was “to do good on the 
largest possible scale.” On March 29, 1913, while still 
in the fullness of his powers, for he was only fifty- 
four years old, his sudden death removed him from _ 
the work in which he seemed so indispensable a factor. _ 
The financial interests of the College had grown | 
to such proportions that in I901 it was decided that 
a: it was not wise longer to postpone | 
Services of +s Weaancire the appointment of a treasurer and 
business manager that should de- 
vote his entire time to caring for the business interests 
of the institution. 
John P. Hooke, Esq., was the first treasurer after 
the War, and, although he served without salary, he 
rendered valuable services, especially in collecting the 
scattered fragments left by the Civil War. His term 
of office extended from 1865 to 1884, or nineteen years. 
Professor Lamar served at the same time as assistant 
treasurer, and, as we have seen, he was also, part of 
the time, financial agent. 
Major William A. McTeer was elected treasurer in 
May, 1884, to succeed Mr. Hooke, and served for 
seventeen years, or until 1901. He was in charge of 
the receipts, investments, and expenditures connected 
with the funds contained in both the Lamar endow- 
ment and the Fayerweather bequest. Professor Craw- 
ford served as assistant treasurer from 1887 to his  
-P-A-G-E-235
  COLLEGE EXPANSION—rI90!1-1919 ‘169 
death in 1891; and then Professor Wilson succeeded to 
the office. Major McTeer rendered the College invalu- 
able and efficient service ; and during the first six years 
of his treasurership practically contributed his services 
without salary, for he received only a mere pittance. 
Mr. McTeer and Dr. C. A. Duncan began to serve as 
directors in 1872. Some of the greatest contributions 
to Maryville have been in service and not in money. 
In 1901‘ Major Benjamin Cunningham was elected 
treasurer and business manager. He was the first 
. to give his entire time to the office, 
Fes tithion and even then he hardly found time 
to do the large amount of work 
required by the big school. No corporation could have 
been served with more whole-souled devotion than 
Maryville was served by its treasurer. And he was 
the soul of honor. When the accountant reached the 
end of his thorough examination of the finances of the 
College after the sudden death of Major Cunningham 
in 1914, he reported that he had found every dollar 
accounted for, and every security in its place. The 
Major devoted all his great business ability to the 
service of the College, and spared no toil in advancing 
its interests. 
“Major Ben,” as the college people lovingly called 
him, fell mortally ill at his post of duty on the first 
day of a new term. A week later his life’s work 
closed. His four sons established a scholarship of 
$1,000 in his memory; but his best memorial is his 
record of thirteen years of able administration and 
official probity. ,
-P-A-G-E-236
  170 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
The first building completed after the Forward 
Fund was secured was the “Ralph Max Lamar Me- 
morial Hospital.” It has already 
been spoken of. It was dedicated 
on May 4, 1910. Pearsons Hall, a 
substantial brick building, erected in 1910 by Dr. Daniel 
K. Pearsons, has, on the ground floor, the larger and 
more convenient home demanded by the Cooperative 
Boarding Club that had time and again outgrown its 
quarters in Baldwin Hall, and that now would take 
no denial of its demand. The second floor contains 
a parlor, halls for the young women’s literary socie- 
ties, and dormitory rooms for thirty-four young 
women. The addition of a third story is spoken of 
later. 
Carnegie Hall, the largest and most costly building 
on the hill, contained suites of rooms for two fam- 
ilies of professors and rooms for one hundred and 
twenty-five young men. A beautiful and comfortable 
building, it had every room occupied from the week 
of its opening and throughout its history. It cost 
fifty thousand dollars, and was the pride of the hill 
and also one of the best dormitories in the South. 
It was occupied at the opening of the fall term in Ig10, 
but was not dedicated until in January, 1911. Its de- 
struction by fire, and its rebuilding larger and better 
than before are spoken of elsewhere. 
The beginning of the required study of the Bible 
in the post-bellum College took place in 1888, when all 
the students were required to attend a weekly hour 
conducted by Professor Wilson in the outlining of the Carnegie and 
Pearsons Halls

Old Testament Sacred History. The next two years 
Dr. Boardman conducted weekly general classes in 
The Life of Christ and other topics. The following 
year, 1891, however, a required 
and common hour was set aside for 
Bible study by all the college and 
preparatory classes, and all the professors and teach- 
ers conducted Bible classes at that hour. This method 
prevailed with much but varying success for sixteen 
years. 
In 1907 by a current contribution made by Mr. John 
C. Martin, of New York, a Bible Training Depart- 
ment was established, and Rev. 
Clinton Hancock Gillingham was 
appointed Professor of Old Testa- 
ment History and Literature, and Rev. Hubert Samuel 
Lyle, Professor of New Testament History and Litera- 
ture. To these especially equipped professors all the 
Bible teaching of the institution was committed. 
In 1909 Mr. Martin contributed $20,000 to the en- 
dowment of the Bible Training Department upon the 
John C. Martin Foundation; and the Directors of 
the College set aside $20,000 from the Fayerweather 
fund to make a total fund of $40,000 with which to 
sustain the department. 
A three years’ course was estabiished for those who 
should elect it. The requirement for all students for 
graduation was made three terms of direct Bible study 
and two of religious courses in theism and ethics. 
Five such courses were deemed a fair proportion of 
the total thirty-six courses required for graduation. The Bible in

The instruction in the department was made as 
scholarly and disciplinary as is that in any other 
course offered by the College, and the new depart- 
ment forthwith took as honored a position as was 
that held by the long-established and traditional courses 
of study. As one of the pioneer Bible Training de- 
partments offered by colleges, the department has been 
of service in blazing the way for other colleges in 
the development of their Bible work. 
The intellectual stimulus of the study of God’s 
thoughts and ways and works as recorded and dis- 
cussed in God’s book has been great and gratifying; 
while besides this good result, there have been seen 
the movings of the Spirit of God illuminating the 
truths of the Word, and creating the noble moral 
character which Maryville has always held to be the 
chiefest object to be sought in any true education. 
Some students take the extensive three years’ course in 
the Bible Training Department, but all students take 
required work every year, and this reaching of all 
students is deemed the chief mission of the depart- 
ment. 
By 1913 an anonymous friend had contributed (1) 
an endowment of $14,000 for a Home Economics De- 
partment; (2) $12,000 to make 
cy saad ample quarters for the department

Its remarkable reception demonstrated the strong de- 
mand that there is in the new Southland for what will 
make better homes and better health. The donor of 
the Home Economics Department is also contributing 
further sums on the annuity plan, which sums will 
ultimately be added to the productive endowment of 
the department. 
The other demand of the South and of the mountain 
region of the South—the demand for instruction in 
better farming—must also ber met by Maryville, as 
it is planned that it shall be, in connection with the 
Centennial Forward Fund, by the raising of which 
the College hopes to celebrate its hundredth anniver- 
sary. 
The Teachers’ Department has long had its complete 
course of study, but, like the Bible Training Depart- 
ment, is most useful in touching 
_ of Other practically all the students of the epartments ERS? ; ; institution during their passage 
through high school and college. A very large per- 
centage of Maryville’s students become teachers. They 
are found in all parts of the United States, especially 
in the Southern Appalachian region, and in the South- - 
west and West, and are employed in elementary 
schools, high schools, and colleges. A six years’ teach- 
ers’ course is offered, for which a certificate is given; 
and in the regular course an Education Group of 
studies leads to the degree of B.A. 
The Music Department was begun in the fall of 
1871, and has had a continuous existence since that 
time. Its development has been most rapid during
-P-A-G-E-242
  174 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
the last few years. The standards have been steadily 
raised, and the conditions for graduation have been 
made of such a character as to give the graduates a 
high rating when entering the great conservatories. 
Several teachers are now kept busy in directing the 
large number of students enrolled in this department. 
In the Department of Expression, which was 
founded in 1899, a similar steady, and of late years 
rapid, development has taken place. In 1916 the scope 
of the work was widened, and the department was 
styled “The Department of Expression and Public 
Speaking.” A three years’ course of instruction is 
given, and diplomas are awarded. The methods em- 
ployed have been very sane and practical, and the 
department is upon a substantial basis. 
The Department of Art had for thirteen years as 
instructor Rev. Thomas Campbell, who died in 1914. 
It has been useful, and, doubtless, will share in the 
expansion that is coming to all departments of the 
College. 
The reasons the College has not maintained a busi- 
ness department have been the fact that the buildings 
have not been large enough to care for more students 
than already apply for entrance; and the fact that the 
College prefers long-term students in order to the bet- 
ter development of character, which is the chief end 
of its efforts. 
More room was required for the young women. 
The architects approved a plan for the raising of the 
roof of Pearsons Hall in order to add twenty-five 
rooms to the capacity of the building and thus to pro-

in his ninety-second and last year of life, strongly ap- 
: ; proved the plan, and expressed

Science, 1912-1913 could not build the proposed third 
story, too, as he had built the 
rest of the hall; but by this time he had carried 
out his life plan and had given away all his money. 
Mr. Louis H. Severance saw the plans, also ap- 
proved them, gave the $13,000 needed to erect the third 
story and otherwise improve the enlarged structure; 
and, as the then anonymous giver of the third story, 
he sent to Dr. Pearsons, through Maryville’s president, 
his congratulations on his life of great usefulness, and 
the assurance of his satisfaction in being able to com- 
plete the building as a token of his admiration for 
him. 
The third-story annex to Pearsons Hall was erected 
in the summer of 1912. The following summer the 
third story of Fayerweather Hall was added, as has 
been related, to provide quarters for the “Home Eco- 
nomics Department.” In each case the roof was jacked 
up intact, and the new story was built under the roof 
without any injury being done to the rest of the struc- 
ture. Indeed, in both cases, the buildings, when en- 
larged, were as strong as before, and much more sym- 
metrical and imposing. 
According to the original plans of Kin Takahashi’s 
Bartlett Hall—the Gymnasium and Y. M. C. A. Build- 
ing—a swimming pool fifteen feet by forty was pro- 
vided for; but there was not money enough to build
-P-A-G-E-244
  176 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
it. From time to time the matter was discussed as to 
whether the pool should not now be built. But it could 
wait, while necessities could not 
wait. So twenty years went by 
after Kin had his plans drawn. 
At last, however, the students took the matter in 
hand, as Kin had done two decades before, and they 
offered to raise $1,500 toward the expense of building 
the pool, if the College would build it. The generous 
offer was accepted, the $1,500 was raised by the stu- 
dents, and, at a cost of $10,000, the building was 
erected. It was opened for use in the fall of 1915. In- 
stead of being in the basement of the gymnasium, how- 
ever, the pool is located under a roof of its own, and 
adjoins Bartlett Hall. The pool itself is twenty-five 
feet by seventy-five, while the building is fifty-eight 
feet by one hundred and ten. The pool contributes 
largely to the health and happiness of the students. 
On April 12, 1916, the only serious fire occurring 
in the history of the College visited the institution. 
Carnegie Hall was totally de- 
stroyed. The origin of the fire is 
unknown. The loss was a stagger- 
ing one to the college authorities, especially as they 
were just entering upon a campaign to raise a Cen- 
tennial Forward Fund of Three Hundred Thousand 
Dollars, an undertaking in itself large enough to stag- 
ger them. The people of the town very generously 
opened their homes to the homeless students. The 
problem of replacing the building, however, was still 
to solve. The insurance amounted to thirty thousand The Swimming

dollars, but it would cost at least fifty-five thousand 
dollars to replace the building. 
On May 4 the Chamber of Commerce of Maryville 
took up the matter of the Carnegie fire, and after en- 
thusiastic addresses by Rev. J. S. Jones and others, 
appointed a committee of sixty leading business men 
to attempt to raise the needed twenty-five thousand 
dollar rebuilding fund in Blount County. This com- 
mittee designated Monday, May 22, as “Maryville 
and Blount County Day,” and called upon the town 
and county to rally for the support of their “chief as- 
set,” Maryville College. The day was a rainy one, 
but in spite of this fact the college faculty and stu- 
dents paraded through the streets, carrying appropri- 
ate banners. Meanwhile the committee of the Cham- 
ber of Commerce was visiting the business men and 
securing from them subscriptions for the building of 
a “bigger and better Carnegie.” The members of the 
faculty had already subscribed $5,000; including this 
amount, by the close of the day, a total of $17,400 had 
been subscribed. The committee continued its work, 
as opportunity offered, and had no doubt that by the 
time of the completion of the building, at least the 
proposed $25,000 would be subscribed. 
In their vote of thanks to the donors of this re- 
building fund, the Directors said: “The directors deem 
this rallying to the help of the College in the time of 
its crisis as one of the most notable and inspiring 
events in the hundred years of its history. ... The 
magnificent uprising of the people in behalf of what 
they recognize as their own college has profoundly 
 
-P-A-G-E-246
  178 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
touched and encouraged those who are bearing the 
administrative burdens of the institution.” 
The reconstruction of the building was begun in 
June, and its completion in December was promised. 
The new Carnegie Hall is a greatly enlarged and im- 
proved building, and will accommodate, besides two 
professors’ families, two hundred and thirty-eight stu- 
dents. Thus, out of an apparently crushing blow there 
has come the rallying of the home county to the finan- 
cial support of its College, and, at the same time, 
almost the doubling of the capacity of the dormitory. 
As this volume goes to press, in 1916, the college 
authorities are entering upon the third post-bellum 
y campaign for increased endowment 
oe Centennial = and equipment. The Lamar $100,- orward Fund, ; 1916-1919 000 endowment campaign of 1880- 
1884 and the Forward Fund $200,- 
000 campaign of 1907-1908 are now being followed 
by a campaign for a Centennial Forward Fund of 
$325,000, during the closing years of the first century 
of Maryville. The Carnegie fire made necessary the 
increase of the sum to be sought from $300,000 to 
$325,000. The endowments and equipment secured 
heretofore are at work rendering their beneficent ser- 
vice ; but they are insufficient to provide for the neces- 
sary expenses of the big school, and are entirely in- 
sufficient to make possible the expansion in many and 
important lines that is providentially called for. At 
least the amount aimed at must be secured or the 
progress of the College will be seriously impeded. 
Indeed, as those familiar with what it costs to finance

a college in these days would insist, a Centennial 
Fund of $500,000 is needed in order to enable the 
College to enter upon its second century adequately 
equipped to fulfill its duty to its teachers and students. 
But the College is accustomed to economy and self- 
denial, and so it limits its request to the $325,000 
which it can not do without; but it can not but pray 
that another unexpected fund, Fayerweatherlike, may 
come to enable the College adequately to fulfill its great 
mission. A faithful steward in the least and in the 
past, it covets the opportunity to prove its faithful- 
ness in greater things in the future. When the his- 
tory of the campaign for this fund is written, it is 
hoped that it will record the securing of the Centennial 
Forward Fund by the Commencement Day of 1919. 
Then will Maryville begin the new century with abil- 
ity more nearly commensurate with its opportunity. 
Early in 1916 the General Education Board appro- 
priated the sum of $75,000 toward the proposed Cen- 
tennial Fund of $300,000, to be 
The General paid on condition that the entire Education Board Be Again, 1916 fund be secured within a specified 
time. Not only is this conditional 
appropriation a great gift in itself considered, for 
it is one-fourth of the entire amount sought, but it 
is also a notable tribute to the standards and work 
of Maryville. And this is especially true in view of 
the fact that this is the Board’s second appropriation 
to the College. The deep gratitude of all friends of 
the institution is due to the General Education Board
-P-A-G-E-250
  18% A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
for these epoch-making grants made to Maryville in 
its times of need, opportunity, and crisis. 
The College is a living organism, and so is growing 
all the time. The problem before the management 
; has not been how to inject life into 
the Beneuiice the College, for it, like its Lord, has 
life in itself; but it has been how 
to prevent inadequate alimentation from starving it 
and stunting its growth. It has all the time been, 
nolens volens, confined to plain living, even very plain 
living; but through the kind orderings of Providence 
and of his agents, the wants of the College have, when 
acute, been met, even if sparingly, before actual starva- 
tion has come. Given a college with lofty, ennobling, 
and altruistic ideals; with a home in picturesque and 
healthful East Tennessee; with students from Amer- 
ica’s best heritage; and with a teaching force of 
earnest-minded men and women who seek their stu- 
dents’ well-being; and Maryville’s wonderful growth 
is after all not to be so very greatly wondered at; its 
philosophy is revealed.

CHAPTER VI 
MARYVILLE’S COLLEGE STANDARDS 
THE motive that founded the Southern and West- 
ern Theological Seminary was one that made it certain 
: that the institution would by its 
The Design | very nature espouse and maintain . Involved High cad eee, Standards high educational standards. That 
motive was the determination to 
supply a thoroughly educated ministry. It was a mo- 
tive that historically had everywhere belonged to the 
Presbyterian Church that founded the school. That 
motive had been strong amid the hills of heather in 
old Scotia, and it survived its journey over the seas 
and into the New World, and even into the mountains 
of the Southwest. High standards were insisted upon 
by Isaac Anderson’s pedagogues in old Rockbridge 
County in the country school and in Liberty Hall Acad- 
emy; and Dr. Anderson established similar standards 
at Maryville. 
There was no theological seminary in all the South- 
west, but the dominies of the frontier were familiar 
with the constitution of the seven-year-old Princeton 
and with the courses of study that were deemed by. 
the educated to be essential for the best preparation 
181
-P-A-G-E-252
182 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
for the gospel ministry ; and so in the constitution that 
they drew up there was every evidence that they 
could be trusted at least to aim high. The constitu- 
: tion they adopted for the Seminary 
Seminary contains thirty-two articles, and the Constitution ; ‘ Revealed Them thorough course it provided for has 
already been spoken of. Three 
years of nine and a half months each were required 
to complete the course. Article 29 provided: “Before 
young men can enter this seminary they shall produce 
a diploma from some college or submit to be examined 
by the professors on a course of literature.” And 
the college curriculum that grew up apace was a long 
and worthy one, outlined after the pattern of the best 
Eastern colleges. Catalogs do not seem to have been 
printed until the Fifties, but, when they do appear, 
the courses they record are evidently modeled after 
those of the best institutions in our land. 
All the regular professors of the institution before 
the War were, as would be expected of a school that 
had been founded as a theological 
et seminary, men who had_ been 
Embodied Them trained for the ministry. There 
were a few tutors, but they also 
were generally either ministers or those preparing for 
the ministry. All the professors—Anderson, Hardin, 
Eagleton, Hoyt, MacCracken, Pope, Craig, Robinson, 
and Lamar—were men who had met the high educa- 
tional requirements of the Presbyterian church, and 
so were among the best educated men of their section. 
As members of the faculty of the College, they up- 
   
-P-A-G-E-253
  MARYVILLE’S COLLEGE STANDARDS 183 
held and embodied the highest standards that existed 
in those days in the section in which they lived. 
The first post-bellum catalog consisted of only four 
small pages, but it outlined a curriculum that was some- 
‘ what in advance of the ante-bel- 
agonal lum curriculum. Professor Lamar 
Them used as his guides in making the 
course of study the best of the 
smaller Eastern colleges. He probably prepared the 
copy in his unsightly recitation room in the dilapi- 
dated college building; but tumble-down walls can not 
limit noble aspirations. Maryville’s ideals have al- 
ways been in advance of its present conditions; but it 
makes a business of realizing those ideals as speedily as 
possible. 
The second post-bellum catalog, of sixteen pages, 
outlined a very creditable classical college course and 
a thorough three-year preparatory 
course, and, in addition, an English 
department for those unable to take 
the higher work; and so, throughout the years, the 
annual catalogs record a steady advance in the edu- 
cational standards of the institution. The College 
has not been the last to lay the old aside, nor the first 
to adopt the new. It has been conservative but always 
progressive. 
Before the War, as we have seen, all the regular 
professors were Presbyterian ministers; and for 
twenty-five years after the War the majority of the 
faculty were still chosen men that had been trained Thenceforward a 
Steady Advance

for the gospel ministry. This fact ensured for the 
students of Maryville the best-educated men of the 
section, men who had enjoyed not only a college edu- 
cation, but also an additional course 
ruined Bevity of three years’ postgraduate study 
in a theological seminary. The 
culture thus attained was, probably, broader than was 
then the rule in the smaller colleges. 
During the past quarter century, as the courses of 
study have been broadened and multiplied, and the 
new order of things has called for specialists, the 
College has used all the means within its power to 
secure thoroughly trained instructors for its various 
chairs. It has encouraged its professors to take espe- 
cial university preparation, and has shared with them 
the expense of that training. It has been fortunate in 
attracting to its chairs men and women of high scholar- 
ship and teaching ability, who have remained with the 
College in spite of inadequate salaries, because they 
have found a deep satisfaction in the altruistic policy of 
the College and have enjoyed working with the ear- 
nest body of students in attendance upon the College. 
It has been the settled policy of the College to use 
whatever additional ability has been placed in its pos- 
session through added resources, in 
aor pean ies advancing the standards of the Col- 
lege as much nearer to the ideals 
entertained as the new funds would allow. The three 
special epochs of advance in endowment—the periods 
of the coming of the Lamar endowment, the Fayer- 
weather bequest, and the Forward Fund—can be iden-

MARYVILLE’S COLLEGE STANDARDS 185 
tified in the catalogs by the evidences there found of 
the advanced and improved standards that closely fol- 
lowed the reception of those funds. New chairs are 
established, tutors are replaced by professors, and there 
is manifest a greater variety in the courses offered— 
the result of the vigor infused as the new lifeblood 
begins to circulate in the veins and arteries of the insti- 
tution. 
For example, as has been stated, the chair of English 
Language and Literature was established the year the 
Lamar endowment was received; and the introduction 
and multiplication of electives and the establishment 
of the group system synchronized with the coming in 
of the Fayerweather fund; while an increased number 
of chairs of science, and new Bible and Social Science 
and Education courses and many other additions to the 
curriculum were the outgrowth of the Forward Fund. 
The College has always looked upon added resources 
as imposing new responsibilities for the broadening 
of opportunities and the elevation of standards. 
Maryville adopted the three full years’ preparatory 
course when the College was reopened in 1866, and it 
consistently required what in more 5 
a anes recent usage has been called twelve 
Course units for admittance to the Fresh- 
man Class. Its requirements for 
entrance were such as Williams, Dartmouth, Bowdoin, 
Lafayette, and other colleges of their type specified in 
their catalogs. 
For several years before 1909, Maryville was very 
desirous of providing a four years’ preparatory course, 
 
-P-A-G-E-258
  186 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
and was preparing for the establishment of such a 
course. In 1909 the College found itself financially able 
to provide it, and so it both established the four years’ 
course, and raised its requirements for admission to 
the Freshman Class to fifteen units. It had expected to 
be a leader in this movement, and was, indeed, one 
of the first in the section to adopt this higher standard; 
but it was none too soon, for the general movement 
in the South for higher standards was already well 
onits way. But, although not leading the way, the Col- 
lege had the satisfaction of knowing that it was at 
least accompanying the leaders of the general advance. 
The standardization of the preparatory courses also 
greatly interested the management, and they gave 
prompt and appropriate attention to the matter. 
In accordance with the custom prevalent in most of 
the colleges up to a very recent date, the preparatory 
students in the earlier days and un- 
oe of til a few years ago had the advan- eparatory and ; ; ; College tage of being started in their pre- 
paratory courses of study by the 
professors of the college department, and of sharing 
their expert guidance. But, as the number of students 
in both departments increased, it became impossible 
for the college men to spare any time for the prepara- 
tory department; and it became almost as physically 
necessary as it was soundly politic to adopt here also 
the decision of recent pedagogy, and entirely to sep- 
arate the two departments. For several years, at 
Maryville, the separation had been practically com- 
plete, when in 1913 the catalog printed in different lists
-P-A-G-E-259
MARYVILLE’S COLLEGE STANDARDS 187 
the names of the teachers of the college and prepara- 
tory departments. 
Maryville College has had from the first as its 
primary object the providing of such an education 
to the young people of the great 
Usefulness of the Giihiwest ar eananals of the Preparatory ; Department Southern Appalachians, as would 
prepare them for useful leadership. 
In order to prepare such leaders it has thus far been 
necessary, on account of the inadequacy of the public- 
school system in many parts of the Southern moun- 
tains, to provide a preparatory department. As the 
public schools have been improving, the several grades 
that were once found necessary were in succession 
dropped until now only the four preparatory or high- 
school years are offered below the college department. 
As yet it is deemed unwise to eliminate this pre- 
paratory department lest the College fail to realize the 
very purpose for which it was founded—the throwing 
of its light into the more destitute parts of the section 
which it is appointed to serve. It is through this 
department that it especially serves the mountain re- 
gion in which it occupies so central and strategic a 
location. And it is the preparatory students especially 
that return to their old homes to be the leaders of 
their communities. The department has made great 
contributions directly and indirectly to the cause of 
general education throughout this mountain region. 
The preparatory department maintains as high stand- 
ards and does as efficient work as does any high 
school in the State. All its teachers are at least col- 
 
-P-A-G-E-260
188 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
lege graduates, while most of them have had some 
university work. Student assistants are used only in 
the laboratories or in exceptional 
emer the cases where the students are also 
Department experienced teachers or graduates 
of normal colleges. So long as the 
department is necessary, it is Maryville’s duty to main- 
tain it in a high degree of excellence. In the favoring 
college atmosphere, the able principals with which the 
department has been favored have found it espetially 
easy to maintain in a very satisfactory way the high 
standards that have been adopted for the department. 
Especially gratifying, however, is the fact that the 
department that has had by far the greatest develop- 
ment and growth during the period 
Solleas of the of expansion, has been the college 
Department department. In 1901, when there 
were only twelve units required for 
college entrance, there were only seventy students in 
the college department; while in 1916, with the fifteen 
units’ requirement, there were 278 students in the 
college department, and the Senior Class consisted of 
forty-two students. The growth of the curriculum has 
also been as steady and remarkable as has been the 
growth in the number of students. It has tried to keep 
apace with the demands of the times, and has had a 
consistent and large development. 
The standards upheld in the college department have 
from the beginning been such as were dictated by a 
desire to impart a sound and thorough scholarship. 
There has never been any tendency toward introducing 
 
-P-A-G-E-261
  MARYVILLE’S COLLEGE STANDARDS 189 
any supposed short-cut roads to an education; nor has 
there been any labeling of the sensational or the shal- 
low or the shoddy as being the 
seem of the marks of the true scholar. No ollege a ; Department Tennessee institution has higher 
requirements for entrance and 
graduation. The alumni have uniformly maintained 
a high standing as postgraduate students in universi- 
ties, theological seminaries, and law and medical and 
technical schools. 
The college laboratories have been among the best 
in the section, and their equipment has been added 
to annually in accordance with the budget. If an 
alumnus has not been a scholar, it has been himself 
that was to blame for the failure. The college stand- 
ards have been high, and the professors have labored 
incessantly to maintain them. The Maryville diploma 
is accepted in many States whose laws permit the 
recognition of college diplomas, in lieu of an examina- 
tion, for the issuing of certificates for high-school 
teachers. 
The catalog has never reported as courses of study 
courses that were not actually provided. More often 
: has the catalog recorded a course 
aa rea after it has been given, than has it 
Standards announced it before it was given. 
After the new courses have been 
tried out, they have been inserted in the curriculum. 
Maryville has always preferred to wait until it has 
been certain it could offer a worthy new course, rather 
than to make a public tender of a course of doubtful
-P-A-G-E-262
1909 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
efficiency or of uncertain value. And so its published 
theoretic standards have been its actually applied 
standards. 
The founders of the College, its presidents and facul- 
ties, its directors, and its benefactors have held be- 
fore them as the matter of supreme 
ai fiche importance, as the principal object 
of the College, the development of 
a worthy and altruistic character on the part of its 
students. With a view to this aim, the Committee on 
Professors and Teachers has never recommended any 
one for appointment on the teaching force of whose 
positive Christian character it had not been assured. 
When it has been disappointed, it has, as soon as prac- 
ticable, corrected its mistake. 
With a view to the development of the character 
of the students, the discipline of the College has been 
conducted by the faculty and its administrative officers 
with great care and fidelity. The College has firmly 
refused to allow practices, however popular they may 
be elsewhere, when it has been convinced that such 
practices would militate against the development of an 
unselfish character. When thus persuaded of its duty 
it has been inflexible. Nor has it suffered from its 
strictness. After eliminating the unworthy, it has still 
had so many students that it could hardly care for 
them. 
It goes without saying that had not the professors 
and other teachers of the College faithfully supported 
and loyally carried out the principles of the College as 
those principles were established by its founder, this

book could not have been, as it is, “a story of altru- > 
Maryville has been singularly successful in 
drawing into its service a body of 
noble men and women who had 
themselves learned the lessons 
of self-denial, altruism, and religion from the 
Great Teacher. These lessons they have lived be- 
fore their students, and so have imparted them by 
example as well as by precept. This, in Maryville’s 
belief, is the supreme test of a teacher; and right 
royally have the members of Maryville’s faculty dem- 
onstrated in this regard their character equipment for 
teaching. 
As to the regular schoolroom work, the writer, after 
five years’ life as a student under the Maryville teach- 
ers, and now, after thirty-two years of association with 
them in the faculty, takes peculiar pride in expressing 
his belief that no other institution has been served 
by a more diligent, conscientious, consistent, and faith- 
ful body of teachers. They have admired the ideals 
of Maryville and have been true to them. To their 
unvarying fidelity, self-sacrificing devotion, and schol- 
arly equipments and methods is due the wonderful suc- 
cess of Maryville College. Uncompensated by suffi- 
cient salaries, but compensated by the reward that 
visits the heart when duty has been well done, they 
are the dynamic forces that have made the College, 
and that have made it thus great, and that, it is be- 
lieved, will make it yet greater. 
During the greater part of the career of the Col- 
lege, it has been true that at least one-half of its di- ism

to be wondered at that these former students, having 
imbibed “the Maryville spirit” 
themselves, should as directors loy- 
ally support, con amore, the poli- 
cies that were intended to maintain and develop the 
historic standards of the institution. The Synod of Ten- 
nessee has always been a very homogeneous body, and 
those who have represented it in the directorate of 
Maryville, whether former students or not, have 
heartily approved of Maryville’s standards of scholar- 
ship and character, and have been remarkably agreed 
in their support of them. The directors have not 
often been men of financial wealth, but they have been 
men of wealth of moral and religious principle, and 
they have stood like a rock wall behind the faculty in 
their efforts to uphold Maryville’s traditional stand- 
ards. The directors’ attitude has uniformly been one 
of helpfulness and not of criticism. 
The student body itself, made up of earnest young 
people, most of whom have had to work for their 
education, have themselves aided 
mightily in maintaining the high 
intellectual and moral standards of 
the College. The public opinion of the College sup- 
ports firmly the historic ideals of the school. The 
students are a body of clean young people who will 
not tolerate among them the immoral and vicious. 
They lend their support to the high moral and re- 
ligious standards of the institution both by their per- 
sonal conduct and by their public opinion. Directors’ Support

  CHAPTER VII 
MARYVILLE’Ss STUDENT Bopy 
THE original field that the College tried to occupy 
was what at the beginning of the nineteenth century 
usteiain and was called “the great Southwest.” 
Western” As we have seen, the school was 
Students christened “The Southern and 
. Western Theological Seminary.” 
And it was a large field that it occupied. Maryville 
was never, even in its beginnings, planned as a mere 
local institution. It practised dichotomy. It divided 
the United States into two parts—its part and the other 
part; the Northern and Eastern sections being allotted 
to Princeton Theological Seminary, while the rest of 
the country was assigned to itself, as its name, “The 
Southern and Western Theological Seminary,” indi- 
cated ! 
The boundaries of the South and the West were in 
those days lost in indefinable frontiers and “Great 
American Deserts”; and they have extended south- 
ward and westward like a mirage until they have dis- 
appeared in the Gulf and across the Mississippi and 
in the Pacific Ocean. A large field in 1819, and a still 
vaster one in 1919. Sixteen of the Southern and 
Western States were represented in the student body

  194 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
of Maryville in 1916; and 713 of the 805 students of 
that year were from these Southern and Western 
States. 
The great majority of the students of Maryville 
have, of course, from the beginning come from the 
Southern Appalachians, in the cen- 
ter of which great region the Col- 
lege was established. Maryville is 
located in the center of East Tennessee, and East Ten- 
nessee lies equally distant from the West Virginia Ma- 
son and Dixon’s line on the north, and far Birmingham 
on the southwesterly fringe of the Southern moun- 
tains. 
There are 251 counties in the Southern Appalachian 
region ; seventy of these counties had students in Mary- 
ville in 1916; and the total of such students from 
these Appalachian counties was six hundred and four. 
And many of the students from other places are from 
country districts that are not well supplied with schools. 
Comparatively few of Maryville’s students from any 
section come from cities. 
At the beginning and during the greater part of 
the history of Maryville the majority of the students, 
if not Mac’s, were at any rate of Mountain and 
Valley Students 
crs ngan Scotch-Irish descent. The ante- merican 
Students bellum catalogs and most of the 
later ones have recorded the same 
names that appear in the directory of Londonderry, 
Ireland. Most of these students have been able to 
trace their lineage back to the North of Ireland. Their 
ancestors came in the eighteenth century by the way
-P-A-G-E-267
  MARYVILLE’S STUDENT BODY 1098 
of Philadelphia and Charleston. Many drifted South- 
ward through the Shenandoah Valley. 
Besides these Scotch-Irish students there have been 
many of English, Welsh, Irish, German, and French 
Huguenot descent. Of late a few of other European 
races have been found in the roster of students; but 
the student body has been made up of pure Americans 
descending from these Old World emigrants, and 
mainly from those coming from the British Isles. No 
college need ask for a worthier clientage. 
In ante-bellum times, while young women were 
nominally not admitted to the College, some young 
women did pursue and complete 
the full course of study under the 
direction of members of the faculty. 
Misses Minerva Cates and Martha Cates were two 
of these “annex” students. In the second catalog 
after the War, the one issued in 1867, the names of 
four young women appear in the list of students; and 
the statement is made that “young ladies qualified 
to join any of the classes in the College are allowed 
to avail themselves of its advantages.” Miss Ella 
Brown had the honor of being the first young woman 
that matriculated. 
In 1875 the first young women graduates were an- 
nounced. Misses Ella and Emma Brown, Nannie Mc- 
Ginley, and Linda Tedford graduated in the Ladies’ 
Course; and Miss Mary Wilson, the sister of the 
writer, graduated in the regular classical course, the 
first young woman, it was said, to receive the B.A. 
degree from a Tennessee college. The next year Miss First Women 
Students, 1867
-P-A-G-E-268
  196 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
Mary Bartlett, the only daughter of President Bart- 
lett, also received the B.A. degree. 
“The Ladies’ Course” was dropped in 1885, when 
the introduction of alternative courses allowed such 
adjustments as made it unnecessary to continue that 
course. 
The young women have always been in a minority 
in the College; but the introduction of the Home Eco- 
nomics Department has brought their number up to 
within about fifty of the enrollment of the young men. 
The number of students coming from States out- 
side of Tennessee was, of course, increased by both 
the Lamar endowment and the 
Fayerweather bequest. In 1902 
the number of such students had 
reached forty-seven, hailing from eighteen States. 
During the period of expansion beginning with that 
year, the number of such extra-Tennessee students 
has steadily and rapidly increased, until in 1916 it 
amounted to two hundred and seventy students com- 
ing from thirty-one States. 
The causes of this extraordinary movement of stu- 
dents from all over the land to this modest College 
in the hill country of East Tennessee are three in 
number: (1) the fact that Maryville is located in one 
of the most healthful sections of the United States, 
making it possible for students from the cold North 
and from the hot South both to ensure good health 
and to secure an education at the same time; (2) 
the excellent educational advantages offered by Mary- 
ville at a cost that makes it possible for those unable Matriculates from 
Many States

  MARYVILLE’S STUDENT BODY 107 
to pay the higher cost of a college education in the 
vicinity of their homes, to secure the education at 
Maryville that is denied them nearer home; and (3) 
the uncompromising and high standards of moral and 
religious character always maintained at Maryville, 
leading parents from even across the continent to 
send their children there in order that they may be 
under its influence while in the formative years of 
youth. The students pour into Maryville without the 
assistance of special solicitors or of a large amount 
of advertising; most of them having learned of the 
College from former students of the institution, al- 
ways its willing sponsors. 
There has come to the students through this national 
enrollment an increased national spirit, and an added 
general culture that is both rapid and pervasive in its 
working. Students from all sections of our country 
meet students from all other sections; and the result 
of their college comradeship is a breadth of mind 
and sympathy and appreciation and Americanism that 
is gratifyingly free from both sectionalism and provin- 
cialism. 
The fact that the clientage of the College is made 
up, on the one hand, of church people of the various 
denominations who still believe in 
Earnest Young 
People P that moulds character; and, on the 
other hand, of the young people of the Southern 
mountain region who have determined to secure an 
education and to that end make a yearlong business of 
their efforts to secure it, brings it about that Mary- the old-fashioned home training —
-P-A-G-E-272
  198 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
ville gathers within its walls an exceptionally earnest 
body of young people. Many of them have some defi- 
nite vocation in mind before entering, and lend all 
their energies toward adequate preparation for it. 
“The Maryville spirit” is so unselfish and all-per- 
vasive that even those who do not enter the especially 
altruistic professions and occupations are largely domi- 
nated in their field of labor, whatever it may be, by 
an earnest desire to be serviceable to their fellow men. 
There were sixty-seven children of ministers in at- 
tendance during the year 1915-1916. Indeed, most 
of the students come from Christian homes. 
For a hundred years, by far the greater number of 
Maryville’s students have had to work their way 
. through school, at least in part; 
a a and and to this task they have devoted ustrious ; : : their vacations and whatever time 
they could spare during the college year. The sum- 
mer correspondence brings to the registrar an ava- 
lanche of inquiries regarding the opportunities for 
self-help afforded at the College. During recent col- 
lege years, at least one-half the entire number enrolled 
have earned part of their expenses by work done on 
the grounds, in the buildings, in the laboratories, or in 
the Cooperative Club. 
It is the rule and not the exception that the students 
should spend their vacations in earning money to meet 
the expenses of the college year. The industrial and 
agricultural activities in the South now afford em- 
ployment to many ; while even the Western wheat fields 
attract a goodly number. Laziness is. not a natural
-P-A-G-E-273
MARYVILLE’S STUDENT BODY 199 
product of Maryville life; the students are by inheri- 
tance and training industrious and self-reliant. 
The students of Maryville come principally from 
virile and vigorous and virtuous families of untainted 
blood and strong physique. Lithe- 
limbed and well-muscled, they face 
life with a physical endowment of 
rare value. Most of them have grown up in the South- 
ern mountain region, one of the world’s most invigor- 
ating health resorts. And their bodies have been 
kept free from vice, so that they are fit homes for the 
clean souls that tenant them. A manly and womanly 
student body, indeed—a perennial happiness and in- 
spiration to their teachers and friends. 
Maryville has never permitted the organization of 
fraternities or sororities, lest they might interfere with 
the development of that altruism 
that is looked upon as the vital ele- 
ment in “the Maryville spirit.” It has, however, 
earnestly encouraged the literary societies, which have 
always been among the most influential and most use- 
ful of its student organizations. 
In the ante-bellum days the principal literary socie- 
ties were the Beth-Hacma (house of wisdom), the 
Beth-Hacma ve Berith (house of wisdom and cove- 
nant), and the Sophirodelphian. As would be in- 
ferred from the Hebrew names, these societies were or- 
ganized in the days of the theological seminary. The 
Beth-Hacma and the Sophirodelphian were in exist- 
ence as early as 1829; and the Beth-Hacma ve Berith 
as early as 1834. They were not reorganized after Lithe-Limbed and 
Clean-Souled 
Literary Societies

the Civil War. The Beth-Hacma ve Berith had a 
small frame building on the southern edge of the old 
college lot; but this building also was destroyed in war 
times. 
The post-bellum societies have been, for the young 
men: the Animi Cultus, organized in 1867, and its 
successor, the Alpha Sigma, in 1882; and the Athe- 
nian, in 1868; and, for the young women: the Baino- 
nian, in 1875; and the Theta Epsilon, in 1894. The 
young men’s societies are divided into college and pre- 
paratory sections. The halls of all of these societies 
were in the third story of Anderson Hall and its an- 
nex, until the erection of Pearsons Hall, when the 
young women’s societies removed to their new quar- 
ters on the second floor of that building. In 1870 
there was also organized the Adelphic Union Literary 
Society, a union composed of the existing literary so- 
cieties. For many years an annual exhibition of the 
“A. U. L. S.,” consisting of a debate, orations, and 
essays, was held on an evening of commencement 
week. Nowadays an annual banquet is held on the 
last Friday night of the college year. The appropri- 
ate motto of the Adelphic Union is, “Bonum Unius, 
Bonum Omnium.” 
The literary societies were long in the habit of ap- 
pointing “editors,” who read from manuscript, at a 
public meeting of the society, what 
was called a “paper.” These pa- 
pers were composed of essays, 
poems, editorials, college news, and sometimes world 
news, generally spiced with wit and humor. This Student

was an ante-bellum custom somewhat modified. The 
catalog of 1854 tells of two manuscript magazines, 
The Literary Casket and The Repository, that were 
prepared by the students of the composition classes. 
The first printed student publication was a little 
monthly magazine called The Maryville Student, 
edited, printed, and published in 1875-1876 by John 
A. Silsby and Samuel T. Wilson, who were partners 
in a job printing office in Memorial Hall. The second 
printed student publication was a monthly magazine 
entitled The Adelphic Mirror, published by the Adel- 
phic Union Literary Society in 1884-1885. A few 
bound sets of both of these magazines have been pre- 
served as mementos. 
The Maryville College Monthly was founded by 
Professor Waller in 1898, and was conducted by him- 
self as editor-in-chief, assisted by representatives of 
the various student organizations. It was a very use- 
ful publication. In 1907 he transferred its manage- 
ment to the students, who conducted it in magazine 
form until the year 1915-1916, when it was published 
as a weekly and under the name The Highland Echo. 
The Senior Class of 1906 was the first that pub- 
lished a college annual. It was called The Chilhow- 
ean. As the years went by, the publication grew 
in size and in the amount of the work put into it, 
until in its beauty and comprehensiveness it has be- 
come worthy of any institution in our country. Be- 
ginning with the year 1916-1917, its publication, by 
mutual agreement, was transferred to the Junior 
Class.
-P-A-G-E-278
202 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
4 Maryville’s Y. M. C. A. was one of the pioneer col- 
lege Y. M. C. A.’s in the world. Its organization grew 
out of the first college Februar 
bg Y. MC. A., meeting, in 1877. Although ioe ounded, 1877 ; y who organized it had never been 
members of a Y. M. C. A., and knew of the existence 
of no other college Y. M. C. A., it seemed to them that 
the Association would be of service in promoting the 
Maryville College religious life, and so they estab- 
lished it. John A. Silsby, in a conversation with James 
B. Porter, suggested its organization, and together 
these men went to the room of Samuel T. Wilson, and 
there the organization was fully decided upon. The 
details of the organization were worked out by a com- 
mittee appointed at a meeting in the chapel held on 
March 2, 1877. The three students referred to were 
also the first presidents: J. B. Porter, in 1877; S. T. 
Wilson, in 1877-1878; and J. A. Silsby, in 1878-1879. 
They afterwards also all became foreign missionaries. 
Of the fifteen charter members, eleven later on en- 
tered the ministry, and five of them became foreign 
missionaries. 
The service of the Y. M. C. A. to the College and 
to its students has been uninterrupted and invaluable. 
At first, without a building of its own, it met in the 
society halls, and in the chapel, and in a room of its 
own; but it finally secured, through the leadership of 
Kin Takahashi, the erection of Bartlett Hall, one of 
the best college Y. M. C. A. buildings in the South. 
From that beautiful building as its headquarters, it 
has touched with beneficent effect every college activ-
-P-A-G-E-279
  MARYVILLE’S STUDENT BODY 203 
ity. Its membership in 1916 numbered two hundred 
and twenty-five. It conducts the college lyceum course 
as one of its “side lines.” 
The Y. W. C. A. was first organized in 1884-1885, 
but failed to keep up its organization in the years that 
immediately followed. On April 
22, 1888, however, under the 
leadership of Miss Helen M. Lord, 
who was then a teacher in the institution, the Associa- 
tion was reorganized; and from that time onward has 
been one of the permanent and most helpful organiza- 
tions of the College. Its meetings were held in Baldwin 
parlors until the erection of Voorhees Chapel, since 
which time it has had a large room of its own in the 
basement of that building. : 
So useful an organization deserves better quarters, 
and, doubtless, before many years, it will be provided 
with what it needs and merits. In connection with 
both the Y. M. C. A. and the Y. W. C. A., the usual 
Bible and Mission Study classes, and many other ac- 
tivities that are now the accepted policy of the best 
organizations of the kind, are systematically carried 
forward. 
It was to be expected that a college that had grown 
out of a theological seminary should from the first 
be a field in which the students 
would very naturally take part in 
religious work both within the in- 
stitution itself and within the community by which it 
is surrounded. The students take part in the church 
work of Maryville and of the surrounding country ; The Y. W.C. A,

and now that Maryville is rapidly developing into a 
city, they are finding and entering an even broader 
| field for social and Christian service. 
The student organization for the February meet- 
ings is usually very complete and effective; not only 
is it productive of immediate and wonderful results 
in the meetings, but it also trains workers for the 
future. 
The Student Volunteer Band for Foreign Missions 
was organized in the fall of 1894, in the days of Kin 
Takahashi; and serves not only to develop its own 
members, but also to arouse interest in foreign mis- 
sions among all the students, and to enlist some as 
volunteers. There have been more than fifty Mary- 
ville students since 1877 who have gone abroad as for- 
eign missionaries. 
A Ministerial Association, consisting of candidates 
for the ministry, has, since its organization in Febru- 
ary, 1901, rendered valuable service on the hill and in 
the community at large. Its membership in 1916 was 
forty. 
The chief athletics on the hill until 1889 was base- 
ball. Football was then introduced by Kin Takahashi, 
. the first game being played with a 
— Knoxville team. Basketball made its début in 1901. The first field day with its track 
athletics was held on April 28, 1893. Tennis was 
played on the hill for the first time in 1884. 
The students soon felt the need, upon the intro- 
duction of intercollegiate athletics, of an organization 
for the proper conduct of all athletic matters. The

first Athletic Association was formed in November, 
1890, with John Q. Durfey as President; E. L. Savage, 
Vice President; J. E. Love, Secretary; and Frank 
Marston, Treasurer. This association conducted the 
college athletics during the following twelve years. 
In the fall of 1902 the Association was reorganized 
on the basis of a greatly improved constitution. A 
council composed of representatives of the faculty, 
the students, and Maryville business men directs all 
the athletic events of the College. 
The fact that the town of Maryville has hitherto 
been too small and its people have been too busy and 
most of the students too limited in means to provide 
the necessary gate receipts adequately to finance inter- 
collegiate athletics, has made the burden of the Athletic 
Board of Control and of the managers of the teams 
a very heavy one. But the members of the teams have, 
in spite of this embarrassing handicap, fought for the 
honor of their College as pertinaciously and loyally as 
if they had all the financial backing they could desire. 
Doubtless, before long, some friend or friends will 
build the much-needed stadium, and thereby contrib- 
ute largely to the solution of the financial problem. 
And the directors and the faculty, appreciating the 
clean athletics supported by the student body, will 
be made very happy in the happiness that this bene- 
faction will bring the well-nigh one thousand students 
whom it will annually benefit. 
The extensive and beautiful campus, the gymnasium 
and swimming pool, the outdoor track athletics, the 
opportunities for outdoor remunerative work, the

  206 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
college local athletic leagues, and the intercollegiate 
contests conspire to make the hill, during recreation 
hours, the most attractive of places to the students. 
The spirit controlling the athletics of the institution 
has, uniformly, been manly and honorable; and fair 
play and gentlemanly conduct have, as a rule, char- 
acterized the College in its intercollegiate sports. And 
so the athletics of the hill has contributed much to 
the development of the students and to the general 
welfare of the institution. 
The campus of two hundred and fifty acres, with its 
twin forests of deciduous and evergreen trees, the 
white lines of county turnpikes stretching away in all 
directions, and the hilly countryside adjoining the 
campus on the east and south, present every facility 
to be desired for pleasure walks and cross-country 
runs; while the glorious mountain heaps that begin to 
rise only six miles from the campus limits and that 
extend eastward for much more than a hundred miles 
of Appalachian grandeur, afford an almost incom- 
parably attractive region for “hikes” in pursuit of 
health and happiness; and never to be forgotten are 
the joys of the long tramp across “Chilhowee’s lofty 
mountains” and up the mighty slopes of the Great 
Bald and along the rugged crests of the Smokies as far 
as where grim old Thunderhead dreams in his Olym- 
pian seclusion. 
The students have formed various other organi- 
zations along the lines of their special interests, and 
have secured profit and pleasure from them. Among 
these organizations may be mentioned the Law Club, 
 
-P-A-G-E-285
    MARYVILLE’S STUDENT BODY ~~ 207 
the Medical Club, the Intercollegiate Prohibition As- 
sociation, and the Equal Suffrage League. The regu- 
Other Activities lar organizations of the various 
college and preparatory classes pro- 
vide for two class social functions a year; while the 
Senior Class provides for several such functions. Stu- 
dents also form organizations for special scientific, 
linguistic, literary, and religious study. There is no 
lack of initiative in such matters. The national char- 
acter of Maryville’s field is illustrated by the many 
State Clubs, representing all sections of our country; 
while the cosmopolitan field is suggested by the For- 
eign Club. 
It is the fortune of most schools to arouse a fervent 
college patriotism that is both enthusiastic and endur- 
ing. Maryville boasts a very loyal 
Society of Alumni; and, indeed, a 
very loyal body of old students, for thousands have re- 
ceived the benefits of a partial course of study at the 
hands of Maryville that were unable to complete the 
entire course of study. Wherever Maryville men and 
women are found, they are zealous champions of their 
alma mater. They are the uncommissioned agents who 
send the ever-swelling tide of new students to the old 
College. 
Surely, too, this is as it should be; for not only have 
they the ties that would bind them to any school where 
their youthful memories cluster, but many of them 
have the additional ties of a gratitude that recognizes 
that, had it not been for Maryville’s marvelous suc- 
cess in keeping the expenses low and the standards Esprit-de-Corps
-P-A-G-E-286
  208 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
high, and then its generosity in affording scholarship 
aid and opportunities to earn part of even the low ex- 
penses, they could never have had a college education 
or any part of it. And there, too, is the additional 
debt of gratitude for high moral ideals and stalwart 
religious character received from the College. No 
wonder Maryville’s old students insist with loving ur- 
gency that “there is but one Maryville in the whole 
world.” 
The College, in company with many other colleges, 
did without college colors for many long years; but 
about 1890 a committee of students 
and professors adopted the beauti- 
ful combination of orange and gar- 
net as the official college colors. So far as is known, 
no one has ever criticized them, though thousands have 
worked hard that they might be honored. 
The first Maryville college song that gained any cur- 
rency was written by Professor John W. Ritchie, and 
set to music by Miss Leila M. Perine, then a teacher of 
music in the College. The words are as follows: College Colors, 
Songs, and Yells 
Where Chilhowee’s lofty mountains 
Pierce the Southern blue, 
Proudly stands our Alma Mater, 
Noble, grand, and true. 
Chorus. Orange-garnet, float forever, 
Ensign of our hill! 
Hail to thee, our Alma Mater, 
Hail to Maryville! 
 
-P-A-G-E-287
    MARYVILLE’S STUDENT BODY ~— 209 
As thy hilltop crowned with cedars, 
Ever green appears, 
So thy mem’ry fresh shall linger 
Through life’s smiles and tears. 
Lift the chorus, wake the echoes, 
Make the welkin ring! 
Hail the queen of all the highlands! 
Loud her praises sing! 
This song, and a very popular one by Professor E. 
W. Hall, entitled “Dear Old Maryville,” and another 
written by Rev. George P. Beard, entitled “Our Mary- 
ville,” are found with other college songs in the “Mary- 
ville College Song Book,” published by Professor E. 
W. Hall. 
The college yell, adopted at the same time as were 
the college colors, is as follows: ‘How-ee-how! Chil- 
how-ee! Maryville, Maryville, Tennessee! Hoo-rah! 
hoo-rah! Maryville, Maryville, "Rah! ’rah! ’rah!’ 
Milton, unhappily, was speaking of a very different 
battle cry, but his words describe rather accurately 
this college yell as it sounds forth on some “foughten 
field” of intercollegiate athletics: 
Their liveliest pledge 
Of hope in fears and dangers, heard so oft 
In worst extremes, and on the perilous edge 
Of battle when it rag’d, in all assaults 
Their surest signal!

  CHAPTER VIII 
MARYVILLE’s HELPING HAND 
MARYVILLE COLLEGE may very properly be defined 
as a study in how to help people get a college education 
who otherwise could not secure it. 
ata Was Its historic mission has been to ounded to Help : carry an education to those that are 
hungry for it, but that are in danger of not being given 
it by others. In its early days it was called “the poor 
man’s college”; and it has never yet reached the day 
when it was not especially proud of its service to the 
humble. It has ever rejoiced in helping those whose 
chief riches have consisted in their youthful ambitions 
and their future possibilities. 
Maryville College was the means devised by some 
pioneer Scotch-Irishmen who loved their fellow men, 
by which they hoped to train up leaders in education 
and religion for the democracy of the Southwest. To 
this end the institution was founded, and with this 
purpose in view students were invited to its portals 
and were aided as they pursued their studies within its 
classic halls. 
Long before it had become a fad of modern efficiency 
in business, economy of administration had been a mat- 
ter of vital interest and daily practice at Maryville.

    MARYVILLE’S HELPING HAND 211 
The aphorisms of Poor Richard were not novelties to 
the directorate of Maryville, but were tried and tested 
rules of its historic policy. “A 
penny saved is a penny earned,” has 
been the thought in the self-deny- 
ing frugality of a century; but that thought has always 
carried with it the purpose that the economized penny 
should make it easier for some young person to earn 
an education. 
Stern self-sacrifice and unremitting toil have been 
the willing price that Maryville’s faculty have paid in 
order that their students should be helped on their way 
to the royal treasure of a college education. The sal- 
aries of the faculty and the cost of the management of 
the institution have been sternly and rigidly kept down 
to the lowest possible figure in the budget, in order that 
the cost of the student’s education might not rise be- 
yond his ability. The only just criticism of Maryville 
in this regard would be found in the fact that, in order 
to assist in this altruistic economy of administration, 
many of the management have through laborious years 
done an amount of work that should have been shared 
with others; and have thus prematurely burned up 
with excessive toil many priceless years of life that 
otherwise should have been their pleasant portion. 
Poor Richard insisted, “Many a little makes a 
mickle” ; and further, “Beware of little expenses.” The 
lifelong effort at Maryville has been 
to keep each and all of the neces- 
sary expenses so very little that the 
sum of them shall not be beyond the reach of the in- Helps by Economy

212 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
dustrious young people of village and country and of 
mountain and valley. The attempt made has not been 
merely to offer a “leader” so cheap as to attract cus- 
tomers, but rather to make all the necessary expenses 
so low that a condition would be created that would 
challenge all ambitious young people possessed of 
health and hands and head and heart to pay the pos- 
sible price and to enter into their intellectual heritage, 
and to become educated men and women. 
The estimate of the year’s expenses as given in the 
bulletins of the registrar’s office is, in fact, an inven- 
tory of bargains that are available on the way to an 
education. And this condition of affairs is not a nec- 
essary or inevitable one, for the increased financial 
strength of institutions of learning has by no means 
generally reduced the cost of an education to the stu- 
dent. Maryville could easily change its clientage by 
changing its charges for tuition and the like; but it 
has no desire to change its clientage; indeed its pur- 
pose still is to help those that need help as they strug- 
gle out of the democracy of no means or moderate 
means into the aristocracy of learning and leadership. 
Very happily it is also true that the general sentiment 
of the student body at Maryville is in favor of the 
elimination of needless expenditures, and is against 
the silly waste of money that has been satirized as the 
spirit of “keeping up with Lizzie.” 
The reason for the low rate of tuition charged by 
the College is not far to seek on the part of those who 
have read the preceding chapters with their account 
of the original design of the institution, and of its 
   
-P-A-G-E-291
  MARYVILLE’S HELPING HAND ~ 213 
unswerving loyalty to that original mission. In order 
to help worthy but needy youth get an education it was 
imperative that the rates of tuition 
should be merely nominal; other- 
wise the doors would be barred 
against them. And so Maryville has never charged 
more for tuition than many schools have charged for 
an incidental fee. It has coveted for itself the privilege 
of doing what many other institutions did not care 
to do or could not do—lead into a college education 
a host of those strong and able young people of the 
Southern Appalachians and elsewhere who lack only 
one condition of an education—money ; and what the 
College has coveted it has attained. 
In ante-bellum years the tuition charges were 
usually about $25 a year; but in many cases, because 
there was nothing else to do in the absence of scholar- 
ships, students’ tuition bills were cancelled by the un- 
paid professors notwithstanding the fact that their 
meager salaries came principally from the small tui- 
tions collected. In post-bellum years, the tuition be- 
gan as $20, and for a time was only $10 and was then 
called an incidental fee; but during the period of ex- 
pansion it has thus far been $18 a year. This amount, 
however, is collected of all, every student paying the 
entire amount in cash. The total sum collected for 
ordinary tuition in I915-1916 amounted to $11,788; 
for special tuition, laboratories, and _ incidentals, 
$8,858. The tuition though small is indispensable to 
the carrying out of the budget. 
The reason the tuition rates have not been raised in Helps by Low 
Tuition Charges 
 
-P-A-G-E-292
  214 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
these more prosperous times is the fact that the num- 
ber of those young people knocking at the doors of the 
College in these latest years who are nobly ambitious 
for an education and yet are financially unable to pay 
what most colleges of the grade of Maryville charge, 
is far greater than ever and is rapidly increasing. 
Maryville is so unwilling to desert its century-long 
clientage that it has adhered to its traditional low tui- 
tion rates, even in face of the fact that some students 
who are able to pay larger rates may thus pay less than 
they should. 
The chief expense at college is the cost of board, 
and if that can be kept low, the principal problem in 
student aid is solved. In the early 
days of the Seminary and its farm 
the cost of board was always low, 
and once, as we have seen, went as low as ten dollars 
a year, or one dollar a month! In the Fifties, board 
in the Students’ Commons was eighty cents a week; 
and in private families, and, later, in the College Com- 
mons, from $1.50 to $2.00 a week. 
When the boarding hall was opened at Baldwin Hall 
in March, 1871, board was offered at $2.00 a week. 
This continued to be the rate until the Cooperative 
Club was organized. Convenient brick-floored kitch- 
ens, furnished with cooking-stoves and tables, were 
also provided, free, in the basements of Baldwin and 
Memorial Halls, in which students could board them- 
selves. For twenty years these kitchens were the chief 
boarding places of the students. All the “bachers” Helps by Giving

saved money, but some of them lost their health, by 
this economy. 
In 1892 the faculty organized the Cooperative 
Boarding Club, with a view to providing good food 
well cooked as cheap as the self-boarding clubs could 
do so. The regular boarding department was merged 
into the Club. By the second year the kitchens were 
deserted, and the Club had entered upon its very suc- 
cessful career, one hundred and thirty-five students 
securing board that year for less than $1.20 a week. 
The first manager of the Club, Mrs. Mary A. Wil- 
son, had had experience in the management of hotels; 
but best of all she had the spirit of Christian service, 
and conducted the Club with as altruistic a motive as 
she would have exemplified if she had gone on a for- 
eign mission. After having made the Club probably 
the best of its kind in the South, she resigned her 
position on account of her advancing age. A few 
years later, however, in an emergency she volunteered, 
though over seventy years of age, to take up the work 
for another year. Her friends warned her that she 
would endanger her life by carrying so heavy a bur- 
den. Her brave answer was: “Well, I could not 
die in a better cause.” The burden did prove too 
great, and during the year she died at her post of duty. 
She left some of her small savings to the College, but 
her best legacy was the admirable system that she 
established in the management of the Club—a system 
which her successors in office, trained under her, have 
continued with great success. 
The Club provided excellent board for more than
-P-A-G-E-296
  216 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
five hundred young men and young women, in 1916, 
at cost—$1.90 a week. It also furnished a hundred 
young women the opportunity of earning $3.25 toward 
their $7.60 a month board bill. The health of the new 
students is usually improved by the good food served 
by the best of cooks with variety and regularity. A 
“balanced ration” is provided. The faculty built more 
wisely than they thought when they founded the Club, 
for not only did they improve the health of the stu- 
dents, but they made it possible for many thousands 
to attend college who without the advantages of the 
Club would never have been able to do so. 
The College could easily make the Club a source of 
revenue by raising the cost of board, but in doing so, 
it would depart from the policy of a century, and 
exclude many of its neediest clientage, and this it has 
no temptation to do. It is rather planning to utilize 
the agricultural department in improving the Club so 
as to keep the cost at its historic low rates. An en- 
dowment sufficient to pay the salaries of the managers 
would insure the possibility of keeping the rates low 
in spite of the general increase in the cost of food- 
stuffs. A far-reaching benefaction this would be. 
Many students find employment during the college 
year in the buildings as janitors and caretakers. Many 
laboratory assistants are made 
necessary by the large classes of 
the various science departments. 
As stated heretofore, a hundred young women find in 
connection with the Cooperative Club opportunities to 
earn about thirty dollars of their year’s board bill of Helps by Giving Indoors Self-Help

seventy dollars. Thus the College affords within the 
walls of its buildings opportunities of work that ex- 
tend throughout every day of the college year and 
are not affected by rain or wintry weather. | 
In the early days of the seminary farm, the students 
found the best possible outdoors work to which they 
devoted a certain part of every 
day. In more recent years, the 
self-help work fund has afforded 
similar opportunities of work in the open. This fund, 
begun in 1893 with a contribution of $477 by twenty- 
one friends, and greatly expanded through the efforts 
of Miss Henry, has of late years enabled the College 
to offer three or four or more dollars of work a month 
to any student desiring such work. During the two 
recreation hours in the afternoon, and on Saturdays, 
many students find it possible to earn as much as one- 
half their board bill. The work consists of every kind 
of service needed about a large school and a large 
campus. Work on the lawns, the walks, the streets, 
the new buildings, the old buildings, on the pipe-line 
trenches, in the woods, and especially, in coming days, 
in connection with the agricultural department, is 
practically endless in quantity, and gives at once physi- 
cal health and financial help to the eager workmen. 
In 1888 Miss Sarah B. Hills, of New York, con- 
tributed six hundred dollars for the establishment of 
_ a text-book loan library for the 
ne benefit of the students. Members 
of the faculty contributed their 
services to the conduct and management of this book Helps by Giving

room, for more than twenty years without compensa- 
tion and since then at a mere nominal compensation; 
and so efficiently has the room been managed that the 
library has grown with the growth of the school and 
with the multiplication of courses until at its inven- 
tory in 1916 it contained 8,905 books valued at $4,215. 
The books are neatly covered and thoroughly disin- 
fected every term. The library has received only 
about three hundred dollars in donations since its 
foundation; but its modest rentals, fixed at one-fifth 
the retail cost of a book, supplemented by the receipts 
from the stationery business, have not merely supplied 
the many thousands of students during the past thirty 
years with books at an insignificant rental, but have 
accumulated so valuable a library as provides all the 
books needed by eight hundred students during three 
terms a year. It annually saves the students thousands 
of dollars. 
Many business men who owe their financial success 
in life largely to opportune loans that were made them 
in their days of lack of capital, 
eg a must be especially interested in an- 
other effort Maryville has begun in 
behalf of the students. Maryville’s father of the 
February Meetings, Rev. Nathan Bachman, D.D., out 
of the savings of the modest offerings made him in 
his work as an evangelist, set aside two thousand dol- 
lars to help Maryville help the young people who were 
out of money but wanted more education and were 
anxious to pay for it out of their future earning power. 
Several other funds—the Angier fund of five thousand
-P-A-G-E-299
  MARYVILLE’S HELPING HAND 219 
dollars and the Margaret E. Henry fund of one 
thousand dollars—have been given for the same pur- 
pose. As a result a considerable number of Juniors 
and Seniors have been enabled to complete their work 
by the timely loans made them from these funds, and 
then after graduation have returned the loans to be 
loaned again to other needy students. An endless 
chain, this, to which no one can take exception. 
Those who have not themselves tested the difficulty 
of earning a dollar in a section where for most of 
Helps by Its the past century a farm hand 
Permanent earned less than half a dollar a 
Scholarships day, can hardly realize how large 
a sum even the eighteen dollars required for the tui- 
tion bills appears, and how substantial seems a scholar- 
ship of even eighteen dollars. It is more than a farm 
hand can ordinarily clear in a month. 
The first endowment fund to help Maryville stu- 
dents meet their college expenses was a contribution 
of $1,500 made by Rev. James G. Craighead, D.D.; 
while the second—the largest such fund yet given the 
College—$6,300, was contributed by Rev. Carson W. 
Adams, D.D., specifically to help in paying tuition. 
During the period of expansion these scholarship and 
self-help funds have been added to until, in 1916, they 
aggregated, aside from the loan funds, more than 
$50,000, and the list fills two pages of the catalog. 
The interest received from these funds is appropri- 
ated by the Faculty Committee on Scholarships to such 
students as it deems most worthy and most in need, 
without regard to or even inquiry as to the denomina-
-P-A-G-E-300
    220 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
tional affiliation of the applicant. The amounts ap- 
propriated, when worked out or received as gifts from 
these funds, have enabled hosts of students to remain 
in College, when, unaided, their lack of resources 
would have made it impossible for them to complete 
the year. 
It is hoped that during the Centennial Fund Cam- 
paign large additions of permanent scholarships may 
be made. Especially is it fervently hoped that the 
efforts to raise a fund of $100,000 to serve as a per- 
manent memorial of Miss Henry may be crowned with 
success. Miss Henry often spoke of her dreams that 
some day so large a permanent work and scholarship 
fund should be secured that it would be unnecessary 
to go out to canvass for current scholarships. She 
raised $12,000 during the last year of her life for such 
current funds—the interest on $200,000 at six per 
cent. A worthy memorial of a great life would $100,- 
000 be, bringing in $6,000 a year to the students of 
the College, and perpetuating the life-work of their 
great champion. Individuals, women’s clubs, Sabbath 
schools and their classes, D.A.R. chapters, and other 
friends of education and of the mountains and of Miss 
Henry may well take part in these double memorials 
and in Miss Henry’s labor of love. 
There are always very many students in attendance 
who can expect little or no help 
Helps by Its from home, and who, for that rea- Current ‘ Scholarships son, are compelled to earn their 
own way through college. To such 
self-supporting students, it is good news, indeed, that
-P-A-G-E-301
  MARYVILLE’S HELPING HAND 221 
tells of an institution where during the progress of 
the school year itself the opportunity is given those 
that need it to earn at least half their board bill; and 
in cases where their earnings during the three months 
of vacation are still inadequate to meet the college 
bills, it is also good news when they hear that an appro- 
priation from the current scholarship funds, collected 
heretofore by Miss Henry and hereafter by her suc- 
cessors, may be approved by the Scholarship Commit- 
tee to enable them to pay the moderate tuition bill, and, 
in cases of special need and merit, even a large amount 
of their expenses. This good news makes very happy 
hearts, and it nerves willing hands to make every en- 
deavor to secure the education thus put within their 
reach. ; 
Maryville delights in helping those that are helping 
themselves, and that need only a little help to enable 
them to avail themselves of Maryville’s rare facilities 
to make leaders out of them. The Scholarship Com- 
mittee makes grants only after careful and conscien- 
tious consideration of each case; and seeks to avoid 
the remotest tendency toward lessening a wholesome 
self-respect and industry on the part of the student. 
It seeks to relieve only that penury that threatens to 
deprive a worthy young man or young woman of a 
needed training for leadership. The grant of the 
scholarship is intended to stimulate the spirit of self- 
support and not to stifle it. 
Fortunately the delightful mountain climate of 
East Tennessee, the good food provided by the Co- 
operative Club, the pure water piped to the College

from the McIlvaine spring, and the healthful exercise 
afforded by the work on the “chain gang,” as the boys 
; facetiously call their out-of-doors 
poe ee ® work force, and by the gymnasium 
drill and the indoors and outdoors 
athletic sports, unite to contribute so largely to the 
development and conservation of the students’ health 
that there is not very much need of physicians and of 
hospitals. 
However, among so many hundreds of students, 
there must be provision made for the sick, and the 
College has made that provision. As the number of 
students increased of late years, hospital rooms were 
fitted up at the president’s residence and in Baldwin 
Hall. Then Mrs. Lamar’s generous gift provided, in 
1909, the Ralph Max Lamar Memorial Hospital with 
its eleven wards and the other appointments of a well- 
equipped hospital. In this hospital ever since its open- 
ing, a clinic with free medical consultation and pre- 
scription has been provided the students on alternate 
days. Beginning with 1913, a regular, trained nurse 
has also had charge of the hospital and has had the 
oversight of the health of the students, and has con- 
tributed greatly to their physical welfare. The health 
of the college people has been admirably conserved by 
all these provisions in its behalf. 
It is the glory of our American system of popular 
education that it provides for all young people an equal 
opportunity for a good education. Maryville College, 
although not connected with the public school system, 
was founded for the people, and is administered for

pervades the entire institution and every department 
of it. Even after their graduation, the College tries 
to help its students; in their behalf, without charge, 
the Faculty’s Committee on Recommendations carries 
on an extensive correspondence, serving especially 
those students who are planning to become teachers. 
One of the students, after several years’ experience at 
Maryville, said: “I never saw anything like it! Every 
one here seems to be trying to help the other fellow!”
-P-A-G-E-304
  CHAPTER IX 
MARYVILLE’Ss MANHOOD PropucT 
MARYVILLE, like all serious-minded schools, views as 
its mission the making of serviceable men and women 
for the world’s work. It counts 
es nee itself happy in the fact that it finds 
provided as a basis for its work of development young 
men and young women of strong physique. The stu- 
dents come principally from the mountains and the 
country districts and from wholesome homes in vil- 
lages and small towns, and bring with them bodies 
of good bone and blood and brawn. They represent 
the best and healthiest physical manhood and woman- 
hood products of our country. And in these days of 
the Cooperative Club, the Work Fund, the gymnasium, 
the swimming pool, and outdoor athletics, the stu- 
dents gain in physical power and vigor during their 
college days. A good basis this, for the making of 
men and women. 
The College deems itself also fortunate in the 
amount of brain, as well as brawn, that its students 
Brain Manhood bring with them as a rich part of 
their family patrimony and race 
endowment. The Southern mountaineers have been 
credited by some physiologists that have made a spe-

cial study of them, as having a brain of somewhat 
larger conformation than just ordinary mortals have! 
But whatever may be physiologically true of the gray 
matter of the material brain, there can be no dis- 
counting of the lively native intelligence of Mary- 
ville’s clientage. 
The thorough methods of instruction and the high 
standards of scholarship maintained by the College 
seek to train into symmetry and efficiency this rich 
mental endowment of its students. The institution is 
aided in its endeavors by the cooperation of the young 
people, who keep their brains untainted by vice, and 
employ their best endeavor to develop and discipline 
their intellectual powers. The efficiency the alumni 
have shown in their distinguished service to the world, 
and the respect they have won from their fellow labor- 
ers in many fields of service, are sufficient evidence 
that they have very largely realized their ambition to 
utilize the capital with which nature has endowed 
them. : 
Superior to either brawn or brain manhood is, of 
course, character manhood; and this best of all types 
of manhood Maryville seeks to 
build up in happy union with the 
subordinate and ‘yet invaluable 
types that have been mentioned. The effort is made 
to develop such a character in the student as shall 
command his own self-respect, the regard of his fel- 
low men, and the approval of his God. 
Maryville believes that a man should be so sincere 
and genuine that his reputed three characters—“that Character 
Manhood
-P-A-G-E-308
  226 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
which he exhibits, that which he has, and that which 
he thinks he has’—shall after all be blended in one 
individual and kingly character. It has no sympathy 
with the assertion of some educators that they are 
charged only with the intellectual training of their 
students ; and that they have no responsibility for their 
moral training. It rather deems its work a sad failure 
if it fails to implant in its students noble moral ideals 
that control their lives. And its success in develop- 
ing worthy character has been most gratifying through- 
out its century of efforts to that end. 
To have the most symmetrical character there must 
be freedom from habits that would impair either man- 
: _ hood or manly influence. From the 
With Its Negative beginning, a hundred years ago, all Qualities of Maryville’s professors have 
been leaders in the temperance movement. Before the 
Washingtonian movement, they were total abstainers. 
Professor Darius Hoyt, in the early Thirties, was edi- 
tor of a Maryville temperance weekly paper; and at 
that early date the students had their temperance so- 
ciety. Dr. Anderson nearly a century ago used unfer- 
mented wine in the celebration of the sacrament. The 
entire influence of the College was thrown against 
dissipation, and there never was a day when drinking 
was tolerated among its students. 
Since the War, the united influence of the College 
has been thrown against the tobacco habit, no teacher 
being employed who uses tobacco, and no student be- 
ing allowed to use it on the college campus or being
-P-A-G-E-309
MARYVILLE’S MANHOOD PRODUCT 227 
permitted to room in the dormitories if he uses it. 
Very few of the alumni use tobacco. 
Every year special instruction is given the students 
regarding the social evil; and the single standard of 
Christian morality is held up for their adoption. Danc- 
ing is not permitted. Abstinence from these things is 
looked upon as not merely a negative but a positive 
contribution to character building. 
Character, however, is, of course, infinitely more 
positive than negative. The “thou shalt not’s” are 
- sts outranked by the “thou shalt’s.” 
toni, Positive «Thou shalt love the Lord thy 
God, and thy neighbor as _ thy- 
self” is the supreme commandment. In a man’s will- 
ing response to it is found his true character. It fol- 
lows, then, that the chief duty and the noblest service 
of Maryville College is to develop positive character. 
And, accordingly, to the development of that force- 
ful moral character all the energies of the institution 
are directed. 
Religion and philanthropy equip man for the use 
and the enjoyment of life, and panoply him for the 
immortal life that is his glorious heritage. By every 
means within its power, then, Maryville endeav- 
ors to recommend to the immortals under its tuition 
these high sanctities. 
In the discussion of the services rendered by Dr. 
Anderson, it was pointed out that it was he that first 
vitalized and developed what has been known among 
the old students as “the Maryville spirit”; and that 
the four chief elements of that spirit are breadth of
-P-A-G-E-310
  
  228 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
sympathy, thorough scholarship, manly religion, and 
unselfish service. These four elements all contribute 
The ME Ne mightily to the making of the 
Spirit” aryve Maryville man; and, though the 
type produced has differed some- 
what in its appearance, just as the costumes worn at 
different periods of the century have differed, the real 
vital thing itself—the spirit—has been nearly identical 
throughout the ten decades. What we may call cos- 
mopolitan breadth of vision and sympathy on the one 
hand, and thorough scholarship on the other, have had 
their efficient influence in making the manhood product 
of Maryville. The other two elements of “the Mary- 
ville spirit,’ manly religion and unselfish service, play 
so vital a part in the making of the Maryville man, 
that the institution deems it the chief end of its exist- 
ence to develop them. 
In its efforts toward the development of this posi- 
tive character in its students, the College has mani- 
fested a character of its own that 
has been of a very persistent and 
consistent type. This character 
has surrounded the school with en- 
during and now historic moral traditions and a relig- 
ious atmosphere that have been a tonic to all within 
the radius of its influence. 
All the five presidential administrations have agreed 
.in this earnest purpose and characteristic endeavor. 
As by a kind of apostolic succession, this program of 
the institution’s life and work has been handed down

methods of instruction and the character of the equip- 
ment have, in the advance of education and in the 
increased financial strength of the College, greatly im- 
proved. It is also believed that the moral program 
and performance of the College have not deteriorated 
during the hundred years since Dr. Anderson an- 
nounced the program and began to carry it out into 
performance. Indeed, the impetus of a century has, 
it is trusted, been of avail in improving even this part 
of the work of the College. But, in its essence, “the 
Maryville spirit” is the same throughout the past hun- 
dred years. It has been much the same in the teachers 
and in the students. 
The College has always been very deliberate and 
cautious in the choosing of its teachers; for if the 
character and the accepted mission 
of a college are to be perpetuated, 
they must be perpetuated in the 
persons of the teachers who make 
up the successive faculties. Without vigilance in the 
selection of its teachers, it would be easy to metamor- 
phose in a few short years the whole spirit of even 
Maryville College, distinctive, historic, consistent, and 
typical as that spirit has persisted. 
It has been the glory of Maryville, however, that the 
members of its faculties have been men and women 
of a deeply earnest purpose, who have looked upon 
life as a mission of helpfulness to others, and who 
have, among their many ambitions, placed highest of 
all the ambition to be used of God in training his sons 
and daughters for their divinely appointed and phil- By a Mission-

anthropic mission. It has been the practice of these 
teachers to say “Come!”—not “Go!”—in their efforts 
to lead their students to walk the paths of virtue, re- 
ligion, and social service. And the results of their la- 
bors have been happy results. “Like priest, like people,” 
should be thus rewritten for Maryville’s use: “Like 
teacher, like student.” And this is true common sense, 
true psychology, true pedagogy, and true religion. 
Manhood must be reverent to be at its best. The 
rash spirit of youth that would “rush in where angels 
fear to tread,” must be better in- 
structed before it can be discreet 
and safe. And so the college pro- 
gram seeks every day of the col- 
lege year to inculcate the wholesome spirit of reverent 
humility in the presence of “the high and lofty One 
who inhabiteth eternity, whose name is holy.” 
The daily chapel exercises, conducted not as mere 
routine by the professors in succession; the Bible- 
school and church services of the Sabbath, which all 
attend ; the historic Tuesday evening conference meet- 
ing attended voluntarily by hundreds of students, and 
directed by the teachers and the student organizations ; 
the Bible Training Department with its reverent and 
scholarly investigation of the word of God as the law 
of life; and even the regulations enforced in the disci- 
pline of the school—all conspire to create and develop 
that spirit of reverence which cannot be absent when 
true character is present. Thus Maryville’s character 
product has, normally, a large element of godly rever- 
ence permeating it. By a Reverent

MARYVILLE’S MANHOOD PRODUCT 231 
The culmination of the yearlong efforts of Mary- 
ville to build the best possible manhood product is 
reached in the February Meetings. Believing most 
heartily that the cleanest, truest, 
noblest, and most altruistic char- 
acter is that which results from 
the fear and love of God and from 
loyalty to his word and church and will, the College 
seeks most earnestly and persistently to lead every 
student to enter definitely and heartily into the service 
of God and his church. 
In ante-bellum days Dr. ‘Anderson, as pastor of 
the New Providence Church in Maryville, usually 
held a special series of services every year, in the bene- 
fits of which the students shared, and in which he 
trained them to be what are now called “personal 
workers.” For the first ten years after the War, the 
College continued to share in the town meetings. In 
the course of time, however, the institution grew to 
such size that it became expedient for it to have its 
own meetings. Out of this fact grew “the February 
Meetings.” 
The first February Meetings were held in the old 
chapel on the second floor of Anderson Hall in 1877. 
; Rev. Nathan Bachman, D.D., one 
Golaue ister of Maryville’s greatest benefactors, 
conducted the services. In these 
initial meetings many decided to live the Christian life, 
including the present president of the College and his 
wife, and the lamented Miss Margaret E. Henry. 
These first meetings, moreover, were immensely im- Preeminently by 
the February 
Meetings 
 
-P-A-G-E-316
  232 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
portant in that they determined for the future the 
character of the succeeding meetings. Dr. Bachman 
was an apostle of love and gentleness and loyalty and 
vision. He appealed dispassionately but earnestly and 
most wisely to the manliness and the womanliness of 
the students. Like Goldsmith’s village preacher, he 
sought to allure to brighter worlds and lead the way; 
but sought first to lead the young people to nobility of 
character through the transforming power of religion, 
and to usefulness of service through enlistment under 
the Great Leader. 
On this same rational and unobjectionable plan has 
the work since then been carried on. Those who had 
expected to find ground for criticism in the meetings 
have become their warmest friends when they have 
seen them and have witnessed the vast good they have 
accomplished. Few of the many thousands who have 
attended them have found any fault in them; while 
most of the thousands have referred to them through- 
out succeeding years with profound respect and grati- 
tude. 
The quiet, elevated, and biblical methods employed 
by Dr. Bachman have been continued with wonder- 
: : ful and increasing success by the 
With Their Able (ther leaders of the meetings. It and Wise ; Leaders has been the policy of the College, 
so far as possible, to have each 
leader take charge every four years. Dr. Bachman 
conducted the meetings eight times; Dr. Elmore has 
been leader seven times; and Dr. Trimble, five times. 
The services usually begin on the first Sabbath of
-P-A-G-E-317
  MARYVILLE’S MANHOOD PRODUCT 233 
February, and continue about twelve days; a forty 
minutes’ service being held at chapel attended by all 
the students, and a service each night attended by the 
great majority of the students. 
The object of the twenty-four earnest and thought- 
laden addresses is to bring the young people face to 
: E face with their Lord and Master so 
ee a that they may see both the Invisible 
and their unseen duty and thus de- 
cide to enter the service of God. Surely no more sub- 
lime privilege and task could be given a college than 
is that which Maryville feels has been given to it— 
the opportunity to implant humble piety and reverent 
religion in the hearts and lives of young people. 
“Fear God” is a message that our young Americans 
must hear and heed if they are to remain clean-bodied 
and pure-hearted, and if they are to have the motive 
and passion for righteousness that will make them 
regenerators of our body politic. The College makes 
no apology for shortening somewhat the assignments 
of work during twelve February days in order that 
the young people may have leisure in which to turn 
their gaze upward and to come to an understanding 
with the Infinite. 
The February Meetings, however, turn the serious 
attention of the students manward as well as Godward. 
: A clarion call to service is sounded 
reales q every day. The proclamation of 
the brotherhood of man and of fra- 
ternity in the common Savior thrills the young people 
with the challenge of Christian and social service in a
-P-A-G-E-318
234 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
lifelong crusade. Great numbers have been aroused in 
these meetings to dedicate themselves to the service of 
their fellow men. 
The religion that Maryville champions is one that 
refuses monkish selfishness and seclusion and seeks 
Christlike self-sacrifice and service. Surely a series 
of meetings that annually sends forth many with high 
resolves to spend and be spent for others, and that has 
sent many hundreds to careers of great usefulness, is 
the glory of the school that provides them. 
A new vision of life’s meaning and possibilities 
dawns upon the student as he has his horizon broad- 
: _ ened until it touches earth’s remot- 
ee Their ect bounds and extends beyond to orming . , Ideals the boundless domain of God’s pur- 
poses for his life. He feels “the 
expulsive power of a new affection” that drives out 
the low and the mean, and he experiences the trans- 
forming power of a lofty purpose. 
These ideals annually transform many lives. Bad 
habits are abandoned; good habits are formed or 
strengthened ; discipline is simplified; and scholarship 
is improved. “Now, professor, I shall go to work,” 
said a young man, who had been one of the most 
careless of students; and he steadily fulfilled his new 
purpose until he graduated a scholarly man, and be- 
came a leader of men for righteousness, and not long 
since the remarkably successful leader of one of the 
February Meetings. 
The religious forces, it goes without saying, are 
strengthened by the campaign. Prayer and the word

of God win such victories as to command a new re- 
spect even from the most careless. Remembrance of 
the Sabbath day and reverence for God’s name gain 
a new control of hearts. The moral tone of the Col- 
lege is greatly improved. February days transform 
ideals, and these ideals transform all later life. 
Yes, these ideals become life purposes. College life 
is enriched by them; but, better yet, in the case of 
very many, all later life is trans- 
formed by them. Conscience gains 
the kingly place of honor and rules 
the conduct. Many decide that their life-work shall be 
an altogether altruistic one, and they spend the rest of 
their days carrying out, at home and in foreign lands, 
the purpose formed in the heart-searching, clarion- 
calling February days. | 
The goodly army of Maryville altruists who in home 
and foreign mission fields are toiling for their fellow 
men are, many of them, living out the purposes formed 
during those days of decision. And the host who do 
not go into a vocation that is definitely devoted to the 
service of others, carry with them into their life-work, 
whatever it may be, the high resolve to make life count 
for others as well as for themselves. 
The February Meetings, the culmination of every 
year’s campaign for character building, make the great- 
est contribution of the year toward Maryville’s output 
of “manhood product.” That Become

  CHAPTER X 
MARYVILLE’s SECOND CENTURY 
THE history of the first century of the College has 
contained two books of Genesis instead of one, for 
the Civil War almost annihilated 
the College. And yet every decade 
of the century has made some per- 
manent contribution to the inheri- 
tance of the institution. And, in spite of the fact that 
the College has never yet had enough buildings and 
endowment to enable it to live comfortably, this heri- 
tage from other days is a rich one. 
A valuable part of this heritage is its geographical 
location. What more could be desired in this respect ? 
(1) Location In the heart of the romantic South- 
ern Appalachian region, with its 
five millions of mountaineers; in the heart of “the 
Switzerland of America’”—East Tennessee, “secluded 
land of gentle hills and mountains grand” ; in the broad 
county of Blount, with thirty-three per cent of its pop- 
ulation of scholastic age; in the beautiful county town 
of Maryville; and in the parklike campus of two hun- 
dred and fifty acres;—surely no more healthful, at- 
tractive, or strategic location could have been found 
in the wide, wide world. And in the days of the New- 
236 Rich Heritage of 
The First 
Century:
-P-A-G-E-323
  
MARYVILLE’S SECOND CENTURY: 237 
est South and of the Panama Canal, the course of em- 
pire is setting this way more rapidly than ever. 
The school has suffered from poverty, and its career 
has been far from placid, but its history has been a 
heroic one. The men of Maryville have been weak in 
salary and support; but they have 
a) Peery been mighty in sacrifice and ser- 
vice. Some imperfect outline of the work of 
these men has been given in this book. And the 
story of the Academies, the Log Colleges, the Theo- 
logical Seminary, the Ante-bellum College, and the 
Post-bellum College, crowded with evidences of un- 
selfish devotion to the cause of education and of the 
people, has been handed down as part of the precious 
heritage with which Maryville of the new century is 
endowed. And it is a record full of divine providence, 
human faithfulness, and college usefulness. It is more 
precious than rubies. 
Another part of the heritage received from the past 
is the character of the College. As this narrative has 
, shown, the founder of the College 
oe ene gave it its worthy character at its 
very beginning; and his successors have striven to 
preserve it untarnished, to be handed down in turn to 
their successors. How well they have succeeded may 
also be gathered from the pages of this book—pages 
that tell a “story of altruism.” This college character 
is worth more than all the financial capital of the 
school; it is what has made Maryville beloved of true 
men and women, and highly favored of God. And it 
has come down to the second century as an invaluable 
   
-P-A-G-E-324
  238 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
legacy purchased at a great cost of devotion and sacri- 
fice. 
The past century has contributed at least four price- 
less boons that unite to form the rich heritage it has 
= handed down to the second cen- 
en tury. Mention has been made of 
three of these boons—its location, its history, and its 
character; the fourth is as priceless as these; it is its 
mission. From the beginning there has been no un- 
certainty as to what was sought; the accepted mission 
of the College has been the making of Christian lead- 
ership for the world’s work. Like Paul, it can say: 
“This one thing I do.” Possessed itself of the assur- 
ance of its own mission, it has sought to make its stu- 
dents men and women of a mission. And the greater 
includes the less; that which more secular institu- 
tions make their chief purpose—the development of 
sound scholarship—Maryville seeks with all its might 
and main to do at least as well as they: but it is not 
content with this achievement; it seeks to superadd to 
the very best scholarship the very best heart culture 
and moral and religious character. 
If the Hebrews had a jubilee at the end of every 
fifty years of their history, the Maryvillians clearly 
; owe for the past hundred years 
Be aaa of God’s providences a double jubi- 
lee. For the patent of nobility that 
was won for the College by the valiant deeds of loyal 
men and true; for the twenty-five quadrenniums of 
college generations; for the ten times ten commence- 
ment days with their students faring away from the

college halls to carry the teachings of Maryville to the 
ends of the earth; for the two half century periods 
embracing the Old South and the New South, and 
merging now into the Newest South with its new 
heavens of kindly promise and new earth of generous 
prosperity; for a total history full of the providences 
of God and the faithful service of men, let the trum- 
pets sound forth a jubilee, yes, a double jubilee! 
While we give thanks for the past with its rich 
heritage, let us salute the future with its richer prom- 
‘ ise. The old king is dead; long 
oo psa ae live the new king! The past was 
great; the future will be far great- 
er. The property equipment, the endowment, the 
departments, the curricula, the faculty, the student 
body, and, above all, the usefulness of the institution 
—all will be increased in the greater future. Nor is 
it difficult to believe this cheery horoscope of coming 
days; for has not the story we have been telling so 
accustomed us to growth and development, and evolu- 
tion and expansion, that we should be surprised—not 
by an advance but—by a retrograde movement? There 
are to be great achievements in the future for Mary- 
ville; then all hail to the greater Maryville of the 
future! 
What shall be the policy for the new century? In 
the case of men of purpose, high ideals, industry, and 
: enthusiasm, it is not difficult for 
_ Policy for the those that know them best to pre- cond Century: ; : ; dict their future course of action; 
for it will be controlled largely by the principles that
-P-A-G-E-328
  240 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
have decided the conduct of the past. This is also 
true of colleges. Whatever changes are introduced 
into the policy of Maryville College will be dictated 
largely by the lessons learned in the school of experi- 
ence. Even schools go to school; and Maryville’s 
future will grow out of the lessons it has learned in 
the past in their application to the new requirements 
of new conditions. 
There are some respects in which a proper ambition 
may be satisfied even with equaling the attainments 
of the past. If the daughter 
Grit _ olay merely equal the moral worth and 
Past beauty of character of her mother, 
her friends will often agree that 
she has done nobly indeed; and if the Maryville of 
the second century succeeds in emulating and equaling 
the moral worth and integrity and unselfishness of the 
Maryville of the first century, its friends may well be 
satisfied; for a glorious record in these respects has 
the College had in its self-denying past. Let Mary- 
ville even live up to its moral and religious traditions, 
in this materialistic and self-centered age, and it will, 
indeed, do well. But it purposes to be true to its 
worthy past, and hopes to take no backward step in its 
onward march. 
In some important respects, however, Maryville’s 
second century will be made far better than was the 
first. As each succeeding decade after its refounding 
marked great improvements and expansion in many 
directions over what was registered the decade before, 
it is to be expected that the history of the College will
-P-A-G-E-329
  MARYVILLE’S SECOND CENTURY 241 
again be one of new advance and success and useful- 
ness. The dreams of the founder and refounder have 
already become realities; and the 
o ate management will enter the new 
in the Past century with the confidence born 
of the assured achievements of the 
past, and with the determination to seek the far 
better things that they are justified in expecting. There 
is no tendency on their part to spare endeavor toward 
the realization of what is possible for Maryville. 
One of the desiderata to be realized in the second 
century will be the coming of the day when Maryville 
can be only a college. As yet the 
(8) aoe preparatory department is a neces- 
sity, and its elimination at present 
would be a grave injury to the cause of education in 
this section; it, evidently, has additional years of use- 
fulness before it for all four of its years, and then 
other years of usefulness for its two upper years; but 
when the high-school system of the Southern Ap- 
palachians has been developed sufficiently to care for 
the young people of the region, it will be the carry- 
ing out of an old program that will take place when the 
preparatory department shall be exscinded, and the 
College shall be only a college. 
The foundations of the College are already so ex- 
tensive and its continued enlargement so certain that 
there is not the shadow of a possi- 
hoa bility of the institution’s ever tak- 
ing the rank of a Junior College. 
The new century will strengthen it and expand it
-P-A-G-E-330
  242 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
mightily, but it will not narrow its field or scope. It 
will always be “a whole college.” 
Maryville does not aspire to do the work or bear 
the name of a university. It has various departments, 
: but it does not wish different 
(5) woe schools under its management ; it 
fears that they might interfere with 
the efficiency of its efforts to unify and strengthen its 
character-forming influences. To be the kind of col- 
lege that its ambitions propose as their ideal will re- 
quire all its present possessions and powers, and will 
utilize all the added resources that the future will bring 
to it. 
Another ideal of the second century of Maryville 
will be to seek to be not only a college, a whole col- 
lege, and nothing but a college, but 
Pemailite Gollcre’ to be beyond all question the best 
possible .college. Maryville be- 
lieves that nothing is too good for its young men and 
young women, and it will be content with no lower 
aspiration for them than to provide them the best 
possible college. 
If friends continue to be raised up for it, as they 
have been so remarkably raised up during the past 
century, the College will approximate every passing 
year more nearly to the ideal it holds before it. Very 
modest Maryville has always been; it has not cried 
aloud in the streets; but very ambitious it has also 
been; it has wanted its sons to be as plants grown up 
in their youth, and its daughters to be as corner-stones, 
polished after the similitude of a palace. It wishes
-P-A-G-E-331
  MARYVILLE’S SECOND CENTURY: 243 
to be the best possible college so as to be able to give 
the best possible training for its young people. It 
seeks to be fit to survive, and then hopes to share in 
the survival of the fittest. Witness, the chorus of 
the college song: 
Orange-garnet, float forever, 
Ensign of our hill. 
Maryville still has its constituency of the earlier 
days; it also has an additional constituency of large 
dimensions. In 1916 it had 287 
students, or about one-third of its 
enrollment, from Blount County; 
248, or about one-third, from for- 
ty-seven other counties of Tennessee; and 270, or 
about one-third, from thirty-one other States and 
countries. 
This large constituency is calling for many forms 
of education. Of recent years it has especially urged 
the establishment of vocational courses. In 1913 the 
Home Economics Department met part of this de- 
mand, and immediately became greatly popular. As 
this book goes to press, a modest agricultural depart- 
ment is being introduced in compliance with the in- 
sistent demand of the times and of the students. The 
young men want to learn to be better farmers, and the 
school-teachers wish to prepare themselves for the 
intelligent presentation of agriculture to their young 
people. The forty acres especially available for this 
department, in the campus of two hundred and fifty (7) Serving All 
the Needs of Its 
Constituency
-P-A-G-E-332
244 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
acres, is admirably adapted to the purposes of the de- 
partment. Maryville is in duty bound to the great 
farming region in which it is located, to provide some 
elementary and normal training in agriculture for its 
students. This it can do without trespassing on the 
field occupied by the State agricultural colleges, and 
without impairing in any degree the work of its other 
departments. 
The opportunities for work afforded the students 
are now mainly for unskilled manual labor. There is 
needed, in addition, a manual training department in 
which the student may be trained in a few forms of 
skilled manual labor. For any clientage this is valu- 
able, but for Maryville’s students, accustomed to work 
and eager for trained skill, it is especially valuable. 
This want of the students will surely be provided early 
in the new century. 
Maryville is anxious to be of more direct service 
to its community and county and section than it has 
been able to be in the past. It is hoped that it may be 
enabled to employ a large enough force to do the col- 
lege work efficiently and yet to allow extension work 
to be carried on in the interest of thousands of neigh- 
bors of the institution who can not be students within 
its walls. For thirteen years (1916) the Mountain 
Workers of the Presbyterian Church have held an 
annual Conference in the College in June, and thus 
several States have been served. Maryville wishes 
to be enabled to render far more of this kind of exten- 
sion service during the second century than it has thus

-P-A-G-E-335
  
MARYVILLE’S SECOND CENTURY 245 
far been able to render. Strategically located in a 
large town and near a large city and yet in rural East 
Tennessee, it desires to contribute more directly than 
heretofore to the solution, within its field, of the coun- 
try and city problems which its students consider in 
their social science classroom. 
The glory of Maryville has ever been, as has been 
reiterated, the historic “Maryville spirit” of cosmo- 
politan breadth of sympathy, 
(8) In the thorough scholarship, manly relig- 
Maryville ion, and unselfish service; and the 
Spirit” achievements that have grown out 
of that distinguishing spirit. It is 
unthinkable that a spirit that has persisted and even 
developed in power for a hundred years shall deterio- 
rate or be lost in a new century that has, if possible, 
even a greater need of its qualities than had its pred- 
ecessor. The College must gain in its second century 
a victory even more difficult, but also more honorable, 
than was its mighty victory over the adversity of its 
first century, namely, a victory over the seductions of 
prosperity. What Maryville men of the first century 
have even died for, let the Maryville men of the second 
century live for, in the highest and truest and worthi- 
est way. The holy heritage of the past is a sacred 
charge, to be guarded in the same noble way as in 
other days it was won. Let the men of Maryville toil 
not for self—for that spirit belongs to the breed of 
baser sort—and let them not strive merely to make 
Maryville more popular, but rather let them use every 
endeavor to make their students efficient and Chris- 
 
-P-A-G-E-336
  246 A CENTURY OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE 
tian and greatly useful. Then will a greater and bet- 
ter Maryville of the second century be the logical and 
worthy successor of the great and good Maryville of 
the first century. 
The ever-available criterion of “the Maryville spirit” 
will, however, continue to be the spirit of the Great 
Teacher himself. Let future facul- 
ties and future directors sit, as did 
their predecessors, at the feet of 
the great Galilean until they are 
imbued with his spirit. Then, and then only, will they 
be able to train their students and to administer the 
affairs of their College in a way that will be worthy 
of Maryville’s history and of Maryville’s Lord. Then 
will “the Maryville spirit” be beyond all question the 
right spirit. 
At the inauguration of Dr. Anderson, a hundred 
years ago, the founder of Maryville told of the provi- 
dences that had helped in the opening of the new insti- 
tution. He said: “Hitherto the Lord has helped us, 
and to his name we raise our grateful Ebenezers.” 
At the beginning of the second century of the service 
of the College, we echo his words and raise our “grate- 
ful Ebenezers.” 
On the same occasion Maryville’s founder uttered 
the following words that have been the Magna Charta 
of the institution he established: 
tee of the «1 et the directors and managers of 
™Y this sacred institution propose the 
glory of God and the advancement of that kingdom 
purchased by the blood of his only begotten Son as (9) Always in the 
Spirit of the 
Great Teacher
-P-A-G-E-337
  MARYVILLE’S SECOND CENTURY 247 
their sole object, and they need not fear what man 
can do.” 
Upon the threshold of the second century, the fifth 
president of the old College would echo these noble 
words of Isaac Anderson as, in his view, expressing 
accurately the desire and purpose of the present “direc- 
tors and managers” of Maryville; and he would also 
propose them as a sacramentum to be taken by all the 
Maryville men of the future, to the end that they may 
worthily continue what was most worthily begun. 
Then will these other words uttered by Dr. Anderson 
sound out for them the same cheer that resounded in 
them a hundred years ago: 
“Let this object be pursued with meekness and per- 
severing fidelity, leaving the event with the great Head 
of the Church, and we need not tremble for the issue.”

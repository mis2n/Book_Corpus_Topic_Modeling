PREFACE 
Recent developments in agriculture and agricultural educa- 
tion have created a need for specialized instruction in farm shop 
work. As many of the teachers of vocational agriculture are too 
busy with teaching and community work, and as others are limited 
in their own shop training, it has been the purpose of the author 
to prepare a shop book so clear in its illustrations and in its 
instructive matter as to fully warrant the placing of the book in the 
hands of each student. It should not require a great deal of atten- 
tion on the part of the instructor. 
The modern farm carries a wide variety of equipment. The 
effectiveness of this equipment and the opportunity of conserving 
labor by its use depend upon its handling and care—a certain 
degree of mechanical ability is essential to successful operation. 
This ability must be possessed by the farmer. But few farms 
are large enough to support a professional repairman, while their 
isolation prevents securing the services of a workman from town for 
making the every-day minor repairs. 
In this book the attempt is made to present a course of instruc- 
tion adapted to these conditions. The aim is not to make of the 
reader a plumber, carpenter, blacksmith, harness-maker, tinner, or 
painter, but rather to give him such essentials of these and other 
trades as will enable him to make satisfactory, practical repairs of 
farm equipment and to construct such new devices as will assist 
him in his work. 
Instruction is given largely by the project method. Many 
devices for use in the farm shop, the dairy, the poultry-house, and 
other departments of farm activity are grouped under appropriate 
heads and used for this purpose. 
This grouping of the projects permits the selection of a course 
adapted to the region served by the school, while the careful job 
analysis of each project permits the shop work to be carried on 
with the minimum amount of attention from the busy instructor 
and thus gives opportunity for student selection and individual 
work, taking the “project” out of the class of the hated “ exer- 
cise ” and making of it something desired and connected with the 
boy’s farm enterprise and his experience.

  vi PREFACE 
Several methods of having the classes pursue the work 
are suggested : 
1. In direct correlation with the particular farm project which the 
student is pursuing at the time—doing such work and making the things 
which will contribute to the suscess of his major enterprise. By this plan 
the shop work may parallel his home project work in agriculture. 
2. If courses are more fixed in length and in term or season, mid- 
winter is probably best for most of the shop work. Students may follow 
more or less uniform work, all well adapted to the farms of the region. 
3. If classes are not too large, the courses offered in the school should 
be very flexible. The needs of each student and the conditions of each 
home farm may be more fully considered and met by the work assigned 
to members of the class. 
The projects have been gathered from many sources during the 
author’s teaching experience and are in use in his classes. They 
have been selected, not only for the tool processes involved, but also 
because of the practicability of products and their use about the 
farm when completed. 
Throughout the book emphasis is laid on utility, strength, and 
good construction rather than on exterior finish. Due to this and 
the fact that all of the devices are clearly illustrated and accom- 
panied by a careful analysis of their construction, the book should 
be of value to farm-owners and operators as well as to students. 
The author wishes to acknowledge with gratitude the many 
helps he has received from manufacturers, farmers, and others in 
the preparation of this manuscript.

CHAPTER I 
THE FARM SHOP. INTERIOR ARRANGEMENT, 
TOOL EQUIPMENT, SELECTION OF TOOLS, 
POWER FOR THE SHOP, SUPPLIES 
Necessity of a Shop on a Modern Farm.—The operation of a 
modern farm has become, to a large extent, a problem of engineer- 
ing and mechanics. Farm buildings of the present time are costly 
structures that must have expert attention to be maintained with 
minimum deterioration. Crops are planted, cultivated, and 
harvested by the aid of machinery. Not only is the heavy, brutal 
work of the farm at present done by machinery, but tasks, such as 
milking, that have long been considered distinctly manual work, are 
now done mechanically. The efficient care and operation of the 
farm equipment, the necessary repairs and alterations to the build- 
ings, as well as the design and construction of new devices to aid in 
the farm work, make a tool equipment and skill in its use essential 
to the successful operation of the farm. 
The Farm Shop.—No definite design can be given for a shop 
to fit all cases; it must be made to meet the needs of the farm it is 
built to serve, and may range in size from a small space about a 
bench in an already existing out-building to a fully equipped 
machine-shop (Fig. 1). In general it is best to have a separate 
room or building devoted to this work, and as nearly as may be, it 
should meet the following requirements : 
1. It should be convenient of access and well lighted by windows placed 
in the sides. 
2. The walls should be tight and warm and provision made for heating. 
3. It should have a wide entrance-door and a clear floor-space large 
enough to permit working about machinery brought in for repairs. 
4. An overhead loft, reached by inside stairs and provided with an 
outside gable door through which long’ material may be passed, should 
be provided for the storage of lumber used in making repairs. A convenient 
way of storing this material is on racks built along the sides and down 
the center of the loft (Fig. 2). 
5. Where running water is available a sloping concrete floor provided 
with a drain, makes it possible to clean vehicles and other farm equip- 
ment in comfort during cold weather.

The importance of lighting and heating should not be over- 
looked, as most of the shop work will be done during winter and on 
rainy summer days when outside work is not possible. A portion 
of the tool-shed partitioned off and fitted up as described makes an

ideal shop: it is convenient to the machinery to be cared for and 
can usually be constructed at a less cost than can a separate building. 
Tool Equipment.—Farm shop work is largely in the nature of 
repairs. Such new devices as are made require ruggedness and 
good construction rather than exterior finish, and these facts should 
be kept in mind when selecting the tool equipment. 
The tools selected should be strong, rugged, and made of the 
best materials. Their value should lie in strength and quality 
rather than in superficial finish. To secure a tool equipment of this 
kind buy well-known brands only, selecting each item singly, start- 
ing with the ones absolutely essential and adding to these as 
experience is gained in their use. 
The following tool equipment for woodworking is suggested 
for the farm shop. The tools marked with a star are considered 
essential and should form a nucleus about which the others may be 
gathered.

TOOLS, THEIR ADJUSTMENT, USE, AND CARE 
Tur present chapter describes briefly how to care for and 
adjust the principal tools of the farm shop. It is essential that tools

be kept keen and in the best possible adjustment if good work is to 
be done with them (Fig. 6). 
Planes designed for smoothing are the principal ones used. 
They are made in five models as shown in figure 7. 
The jointer plane is from 20 inches to 28 inches long with a 
21-inch cutting blade or bit. It is heavy and sturdy in construction 
and is designed for straightening edges and surfaces. 
i
-P-A-G-E-22
  TOOLS, THEIR ADJUSTMENT, USE, AND CARE 
  The fore plane is similar to the jointer but is shorter, being 
about 18 inches long. Because of its shorter length and greater 
convenience it is used on smaller work. For the farm shop this 
plane can take the place of the jointer in the plane equipment. 
The jack plane is from 14 inches to 16 inches long. It is 
designed for pre-surfacing rough lumber that is afterward to be 
finished with the smoothing plane. When used for this purpose the 
cutting edge should be ground to a broad curve rather than a 
straight line. It is frequently used in place of the jointer or fore 
plane, and when kept for this purpose the edge should have a 
slight curvature only. 
The smoothing plane is a short, broad plane about 9 inches

plane; 4, fore plane; 5, jointer. 
long. It is used to give a smooth surface to the work after the 
inequalities have been leveled with one of the longer planes. 
The block plane is about 6 inches long. It is designed for 
planing across the end grain of wood. Ordinarily this plane should 
be but little used. Although convenient for occasional use, the 
smoothing plane, if properly set, will do most of the work required 
of it. 
Parts of the Plane.—The accompanying illustration (Fig. 8) 
and explanation of the different parts aids in understanding the 
plane and its proper adjustment. 
The plane iron or bit is the cutting edge of the plane. It 
should be ground to the proper shape (Fig. 9), whetted keen, and 
adjusted to cut a thin shaving over its entire width. 
The plane iron cap (2) has three uses: it provides a spring 
tension for holding the plane iron tightly to its seat; it permits 
lowering the cutting edge as it is worn away through use; and its 
curved shape at the lower end breaks the shaving as it is pared

aided in breaking the shaving by the forward edge of the throat 
(17), and it is sometimes desirable to move the frog (6), which 
carries the cutting and adjusting mechanism, forward, closing the 
throat somewhat and bringing the cutting edge nearer the bear- 
ing edge (17). 
The adjusting nut (8) is used to move the cutting edge up or 
down for a thicker or thinner shaving, turning it to the right or to 
the left as the case requires. It acts through the “ Y ” adjusting 
lever (7). 
The lateral adjusting lever (9) is used to bring the cutting 
edge parallel to the width of the bottom surface of the plane by 
swinging it sidewise. The under side of the plane is called the sole, 
the forward end being termed the toe, while the part back of the 
handle is called the heel. 
The lever cap (4) clamps the cutting mechanism in place 
through the action of the cam lever at the top. The lever cap 
screw (5) serves as a fulcrum and should be tightened until the 
lever works snugly and the plane bit is held securely. 
Sharpening the Plane.—Plane irons are sharpened by grind- 
ing, whetting, and stropping. The grinding may be done either on 
a high-speed dry grinding-wheel, or on the regular grindstone. Hold 
the plane iron against the grinding-wheel as shown in figure 9, 
forming a bevel of from 20 to 25 degrees. Be careful to retain the 
original angle of bevel. 
Whetting and stropping a plane iron is necessary to smooth 
up the rough edge left by grinding. A good artificial stone of 
medium fine grit is used for this purpose. Because of the use of 
oil to float off the steel particles removed by whetting, it is called 
an oil-stone. A good grade of 
light, non-gumming oil should 
be used and the stone kept clean 
and covered when not in use 
(Fig. 10). 
Tests for Keenness.—A 
rough test for keenness is to 
hold the edge to the light. If 
dull, it will appear as a fine 
bright line, due to its rounded 
condition. If keen, it will be in-

the thumb lightly over the edge to be tested (Fig. 11). The 
thumb will slip over a dull edge, while a sharp one will catch 
in the cuticle. Care must be exercised in doing this or a bad cut 
may result. After whetting a plane iron the parts should be wiped 
free from grit before reassembling (Fig. 12). Test the plane on a 
piece of waste wood and, if necessary, adjust until it cuts properly. 
  Fia. 11.—Testing an edge for keenness. Fie. 12.—Adjusting plane for thickness of 
shaving. 
The proper thickness of shaving will vary with the work being done. 
Where the purpose is to reduce in size, a comparatively thick shav- 
ing may be taken. Where it is desired to smooth the work only, 
the plane should be set to cut lightly. A properly whetted and 
adjusted plane will pare a thin shaving, which will come from the 
throat in curls (Fig. 13). 
Precautions to Prevent Dulling.—To avoid unnecessary dull- 
ing, form the habit of placing the plane on its side when not in use,

  12 TOOLS, THEIR ADJUSTMENT, USE, AND CARE 
keeping the edge from contact with the gritty bench-top. A drop 
of light machine oil applied occasionally to the moving parts of the 
plane keeps them working easily and free from rust. 
Troubles and Remedies.—When a good plane, properly whet- 
ted and adjusted, fails to do satisfactory work there is usually some

which will come from the throat in curls. 
easily removable cause that is making the trouble. Some of the 
most common troubles are outlined here with means of cor- 
recting them. 
1. Choking is caused by shavings catching beneath the lower edge of 
the cap iron and lever cap, which should be filed smooth. Wet or pitchy 
lumber will frequently cause clogging. Keep the plane keen and clean 
frequently. 
2. Chattering is caused by the springing of the cutting mechanism, if 
set too deep, clogged with wood, or if material is knotty. 
3. Ridges or Marks on Finished Work are of two kinds, raised or 
sunken. The common causes are nicks in the blade, high corners on the 
blade, and roughness on heel or toe of the plane, which may be smoothed 
by filing (Fig. 14).
-P-A-G-E-27
  HAND SAWS 13 
Other Edged Tools.—The sharpening of chisels, slicks, hand 
axes, draw knives, and other tools having a similar bevel is much 
the same as for plane irons. The 
angle of bevel is approximately 
the same—about 30 degrees— 
and should vary with the work 
for which the tool is being fitted. 
For heavy mortising in hard, 
knotty wood a chisel should have 
a blunter bevel than when fitted 
for paring or other light work. 
The extremely thin edge pro- 
duced by the long bevel is not 
strong enough to stand up under 
heavy work. When whetting the 
draw knife it is more convenient 
to hold it rigidly and move the 
oil-stone over it. (Fig. 15). 
Hand Saws.—The saw equipment will consist of a rip saw, a 
cutting-off saw, and a compass saw. The first two mentioned are

alike in general appearance but are differentiated by the shape of 
their teeth (Fig. 16). The compass saw has a much narrower
-P-A-G-E-28
  14 TOOLS, THEIR ADJUSTMENT, USE, AND CARE 
blade than the others, which permits it to be passed through a small 
opening and to be turned easily when cutting a curved outline. A 
saw is designated by its length and the number of points per inch, 
which will be found stamped on the blade near the handle. It will 
be noted that there is one more point per inch than there are teeth 
(Fig. 16). 
Fitting the Saws.—The points of the teeth must be in an even 
line from the heel to the point of the saw, sharp, even, and of the 
proper shape. This line should not be straight, but should be 
slightly curved, giving what is termed “breast” or “crown” to 
the saw. A thin stiff blade is necessary for easy cutting. 
Jointing is the first step in saw-fitting (Fig. 17). A file is run 
lengthwise of the saw blade with its face at right angles to the side

of the saw and the teeth dressed to a uniform height. Jointing 
should be carried no further than required to get this result, as -it 
makes more filing necessary. The original crown of the saw should 
be preserved when jointing. If it has been destroyed by previous 
filings it should be restored somewhat at this time. The crown 
should be restored gradually, adding a little more curvature each 
time the saw is jointed until the original shape is restored. A saw 
that is kept in good condition will require but a few light strokes 
of the file to bring the points of the teeth to an even line. 
Setting.—After the saw is jointed it should be set (Fig. 18) by 
bending the points of the teeth alternately to the right and left, 
making the edge of the saw slightly wider than the back and per- 
mitting it to run freely in the cut. A good saw has its back ground

set in the points of the teeth only, and set each tooth equally. Set-

distort or crack the blade. If the saw is kept in good condition a 
single setting will do for two or more filings, a sharp saw requiring 
much less set than one that is dull. - More set is required for wet or 
green lumber than for dry material. 
    Fra. 19.—Filing a saw. 
Filing the teeth to a point or edge is the third operation in saw- 
fitting. Due to the shape of the teeth the cutting-off saw and rip 
saw are filed differently. 
Filing the Rip Saw.—Place the saw in the clamp, securely 
fastened breast-high in a good light (Fig. 19). Use a file to fit the
-P-A-G-E-30
16 TOOLS, THEIR ADJUSTMENT, USE, AND CARE 
    work ; usually a 5-inch or 6-inch slim taper file will give good results 
on saws of this size. Grasp the file-handle firmly in the right hand 
and support the tip of the file between the thumb and fingers of the 
left hand (Fig. 19). Hold the file level and file straight across at 
right angles to the edge of the saw in such a way that the face of 
the tooth will be vertical (Fig. 20). If the teeth show unevenness in 
size crowd the file against the larger ones to make them uniform. 
Use the file its full length and release the pressure on the return 
stroke, as it cuts only in a forward direction. Filing may be begun 
at either the heel or point of the saw, filing each alternate tooth,

then reversing and filing the other side. A noted saw-manufacturer 
recommends filing from the point of the saw against the cutting 
edge of the teeth turned toward the filer by setting. Filing 
“ against the set ” in this way prevents the formation of the “ feather 
edge,” so likely to be produced when filing is done from the back of 
the tooth “ with the set.” If the saw is securely clamped close to the 
edge there will be little trouble from chattering. The proper shape 
of the rip saw tooth is shown in figures 16 and 20. 
Filing the Hand Saw.—The teeth of this saw, being designed 
for cutting across the grain, differ in shape from those of the rip 
saw. The angle at the point remains 60 degrees, but the whole tooth 
is tipped backward so that the front stands at an angle of about 12 
degrees with the vertical (Fig. 16). This makes the back of the 
tooth meet the edge of the saw quicker and results in a deeper tooth
-P-A-G-E-31
  THE STEEL SQUARE 7 
for a given number of points per inch. The face of the tooth is also 
given some bevel, the exact amount depending upon the work for 
which the saw is being fitted. A bevel suitable for general use is 
formed by holding the file across the edge of the saw at an angle 
from 60 to 70 degrees with the length of the blade (Fig. 20). The 
handle of the file should be lowered slightly; it forms a little 
deeper tooth and tends to prevent chattering. More bevel is given 
for soft woods than for hard dry material. After filing, the saw 
should be examined and any of the teeth showing “ tops,” indicat- 
ing that they have not yet been brought to a point, should be 
carefully pointed up. Discontinue filing as soon as a point has 
been reached, or the tooth will be made too short. 
Side-filing.—Place the saw-blade flat on the bench-top and 
with a flat file or oil-stone rub lightly on the sides of the teeth 
  Fia. 21.—Side-filing a saw to even up set. 
(Fig. 21). Side-filing must not be overdone or the saw will bind 
or pinch in the cut. A properly fitted hand saw, when the sight is 
directed along the toothed edge from heel to point, should show a 
groove down which a fine needle might be slid the length of 
the blade. 
The compass saw is designed for sawing curves and for work- 
ing in places where the regular saw-blade would be too wide. It is 
given a wide set to permit it to be turned readily in the cut. As it 
cuts both lengthwise and crosswise of the grain its teeth are a com- 
promise between those of the cutting-off saw and those of the rip 
saw, having little bevel and with the face of the tooth nearly vertical. 
The steel square is a tool used in laying out and assembling 
work, and must be kept a right angle if satisfactory work is to be 
done with it. Using it as a scraper to remove dirt or concrete from 
2
-P-A-G-E-32
    18 TOOLS, THEIR ADJUSTMENT, USE, AND CARE 
lumber results in wear and inaccuracy. A fall may open or close 
the angle slightly, making the square inaccurate. Should this hap- 
pen, it may be returned to its original shape by placing it on an 
anvil and peening lightly near 
the outside or inside corner as 
the case requires (Fig. 22). 
The level is used in build- 
ing, its purpose being to insure 
that work is placed “level,” or 
parallel with the horizon; or 
“plumb,” which is at right an- 
gles to a level surface. It acts by 
the pull of gravity, the necessary 
parts being a glass tube filled 
nearly full with ether or other 
non-freezing liquid and a stock for carrying this bubble tube. The 
bubble tube is mounted in such a way that the lower edge of the 
stock is level when the bubble stands in the middle. When placed 
on an inclined surface the bubble floats to the higher end of the 
tube. To cause it to stand in the center of the tube when the work 
has finally been made level the tube is curved. 
Testing and Adjusting the Level.—The level is frequently 
made inaccurate by careless handling. If the bubble changes posi-

tion when the level is changed end for end on a solid plane surface 
it shows that the level is out of adjustment. In all the better levels 
the bubble tube is supported in a frame that may be adjusted by 
means of a screw (Fig. 23).

  SHARPENING THE AUGER BIT 19 
Selecting a Level.—A good carpenter’s level with a wood stock 
made up from several pieces glued together makes a satisfactory 
tool for farm use. This construction tends to prevent warping. A 
machinist’s level with a metal frame is more accurate, but is also 
more easily broken. 
Auger bits are used for boring practically all holes in wood 
from 1/4 inch in diameter up. The type with the solid-center stem

(Fig. 26). QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES

CHAPTER IIT 
BASIC TOOL OPERATIONS 
Every piece of shopwork, whether it be repairing or new con- 
struction, is a combination of such basic tool operations as planing, 
ripping, boring, etc. For example, the fitting of a board to a rec- 
tangular opening involves the operations of squaring, cutting to 
length, and ripping to the correct width. Jointing and smooth- 
planing may be necessary also if the piece is to be closely fitted. 
Laying Out Work.—It is seldom that a board is found whose 
edges are exactly parallel. For this reason all work should be laid 
out from one edge, one face, and one end, called respec‘ively the 
working ee:

Study processes of making these very true in figures 28, 29, 30, 31, 
and 82. 
Gauging.—Set the gauge the required distance from the point. 
(1) Measure this distance with the rule as shown in figure 33, for 
due to wear the graduations on the beam cannot always be trusted. 
(2) Roll the gauge slightly, so that the point engages the wood 
lightly at an angle, and push it from one end of the work to the 
other (Fig. 34), keeping the gauge-head crowded against the work- 
ing edge. (3) Rough-gauging may be done with the rule and pencil 
as shown in figure 35. 
Rip-sawing.—Hold the work with the knee as shown in figure 
36. Keep the saw at an angle of about 45 degrees and cut with 
long, easy sweeps. Use little pressure; crowding will cause the saw

  26 BASIC TOOL OPERATIONS 
For rough paring and the rapid removal of wood, hold the chisel 
as shown in figure 40, with the bevel down and the edge obliquely 
across the work. It is guided with the left hand and forced through 
the wood with the right, using blows with the palm of the hand if

necessary. Where a true flat surface is required the chisel is used 
with the bevel up and laid flat, or nearly so, on the work (Fig. 41).
-P-A-G-E-41
  SCRIBING, LAYING OUT WORK 27 
The wood is first scored by cutting parallel grooves across it with 
the corner of the chisel and the waste material then pared out. To 
prevent splintering keep the chisel keen and work from both edges 
toward the center. 
Remove all the material possible by boring when making a 
mortise. A through mortise is laid out and worked from both sides 
to insure accurate work. Hold the chisel as shown in figure 42, with 
the bevel toward the opening made by boring. 
Boring in wood should be done carefully. (1) Unless at an 
angle the hole should be made perpendicular to the surface by 
means of a try square (Fig. 43). Practice 
gives a sense of perpendicularity that 
should be cultivated. (2) When boring 
through material place the hand back of 
the work and start the bit from the oppo- 
site side as soon as the lead screw pricks 
through (Fig. 44). This will prevent 
splintering. A piece of waste material 
clamped back of the work can be used for 
the same purpose. (3) Continue turning 
in the forward direction when pulling the 
bit out. This cleans the chips from 
the hole. 
Hewing.—In rough construction wane- 
edged boards are frequently straightened 
with the hand-axe. A guide line is made 
with the chalk line or straight edge, and 
the axe first used at an abrupt angle, mak- 
ing cuts at intervals of two to four inches 
along the edge of the work nearly to the 
line. It is then used more nearly parallel Fre. 45.—Hewing with hand : axe. The board is first “ , to the line and the waste wood removed fo prevent splitting and then (Fig. 45). hewed to the line. 
Scribing, Laying Out Work with the Dividers.—The divid- 
ers are used in “scribing” an edge to fit against an irregular 
surface. The board to be fitted is temporarily fastened in position 
with its edge against the surface it is to fit when finished. The 
dividers are set with the points separated by a slightly greater dis-

  tance than the width of the greatest opening between the parts to 
be fitted and are drawn along the length of the board, one leg bear- 
ing against the irregular surface and the other point tracing a 
parallel line on the board (Fig. 46). 
When using the dividers to lay off a distance in a given number 
of equal parts set them as closely as possible on the square (Fig. 
47), making the final close adjust- 
ment with the nut on the side. 
Step off the distance along a 
straight line, and should it not 
come out exact the first time 
change the space of the divider 
points an amount proportionate to 
the error, and space the line again.

dividers to fit against an irregular surface. Making final close adjustment by One leg follows the surface to be fitted means of thumb-screw. while the other traces a corresponding mark on the board. 
Leveling and Plumbing.—The following precautions should be 
observed when using the level. (1) See that it rests fairly on the 
work. Where the surface is irregular, a long straight edge with 
parallel edges may be placed against it and the level held on this. 
This provides a representative bearing for the level. A level line 
may be carried a considerable distance by first setting a row of stakes 
and marking from one to another with the level and straight edge. 
(2) Where a level line is to he carried any distance the level should 
be turned end for end at each alternate application. This tends to

correct inaccuracies in the level and prevents them from becoming 
cumulative. (3) Handle the level carefully at all times. When 
necessary to tap the work being leveled to bring it to position the 
level should be raised and not allowed to receive the jar of the 
hammer blow. 
Using the Plumb Bob and Line.—In building it is often 
necessary to locate a point on the ceiling directly over another on

the floor, or vice versa. This is best done with the plumb bob and 
line. Suspend the bob from the ceiling, using line enough to per- 
mit it to swing just clear of the floor (Fig. 48) and move it about 
until the point of the bob comes to rest just over the desired point 
on the floor. Mark the point where the line touches the ceiling. To 
transfer a point from the ceiling to the floor suspend the bob from 
the point on the ceiling and mark the point on the floor where the 
bob comes to rest. The points are best marked by two lines crossing 
at an angle, the intersection being directly over the point. See that 
the bob swings clear and is protected from the wind.

    30 BASIC TOOL OPERATIONS 
The sliding tee bevel is used for laying out work at any angle 
other than a right angle. It is set in one of three ways: (1) By 
fitting it to an angle already cut. (2) By juxtaposition over a draw- 
ing. (3) By means of the 
steel square. Practically 
any angle can be obtained 
from the square. The 
bevel is held against it as 
shown in figure 49, and 
set to the angle desired.

  CHAPTER IV 
GEOMETRICAL CONSTRUCTION USED IN FARM 
CARPENTRY 
During the building and repairs common about the farm, many 
geometrical problems, such as the determination of a roof pitch or 
rafter length, come up for solution and must be solved with a cer- 
tain degree of exactness. 
The steel square is the principal tool used in laying out work, 
and although very simple is capable of doing a wide variety of work. 
The form most commonly used consists of a “blade” 24 inches 
long and 2 inches wide, with a “tongue” 16 inches-long and 114 
inches wide affixed to it at right angles, forming a single L-shaped 
piece of steel. 
Measuring.—The edges of the square carry every graduation 
commonly used, and in addition a 1/100 scale. One side has the 
inches divided into twelve equal parts each, a system of graduation 
useful when laying out work to scale. 
Determining Rafter Lengths and Cuts.—A rafter is one of 
the parallel timbers composing the framework of a roof extending 
Plureb Cat

from the plate to the ridge. On the common gable roof (Fig. 52), 
rafters are used in pairs, meeting each other at the ridge by an 
oblique cut and seating on the plate in the same manner. The 
cut at the top, being vertical, is called the “ plumb cut,” while the 
joint at the plate is called the “seat cut.” 
3 33
-P-A-G-E-48
34 GEOMETRICAL CONSTRUCTION 
The widtti of the building from outside to outside of the plate 
is called the “span,” half of the span being called the “run,” 
while the vertical distance from the plate to the ridge is known as 
the “ rise.” 
The slope of a roof is known as the “pitch” and is expressed 
in a fractional form, the rise being used as the numerator while the 
span is used as the denominator. A roof 24 feet wide, with a rise of 
6 feet, would be called a 14 pitch roof, °/,, being equal to 14. A

half-pitch roof, one in which the rise is equal to 1% the span, is fre- 
quently referred to as a “ square pitch,” the rafters forming a right 
angle at the ridge. The common roof pitches, together with the 
necessary measurements to be taken on the square to obtain the 
proper angles and lengths for the rafters, are shown in figure 53. 
The rise and run of a roof form the imaginary base and altitude 
of a right triangle of which the rafter is the hypotenuse. This fact 
is used in laying out the roof. A certain proportion of the rise, 
usually one-twelfth, is taken on the tongue of the square and the 
same proportion of the run is taken on the blade. When these points 
are connected by a diagonal line, the length of the line will represent 
the same proportion of the length of the rafter. The triangles 
formed by the square and the rafter are similar. 
   
-P-A-G-E-49
  
LAYING OUT BRACES 35 
In practice the rafter length is obtained as follows: 
Rule.—Take as many inches on the tongue of the square as there 
are feet in the rise of the roof and as many inches on the blade of the 
square as there are feet in the run. Hold the square so that the points 
so selected just touch the edge of the rafter, or a line gauged 2 inches from

Fic. 54.—Method of using steel square in laying out rafters. 
its upper edge, and apply it as indicated in figure 54 twelve times. This 
will give the correct length of the rafter, as well as the cut at both the top 
and bottom. Figure 54 shows a rafter being laid out for a roof 16 feet 
wide with a six-foot rise. 
The rafter as commonly used is left projecting beyond the plate 
to form a framework for the eaves. The thickness of this projection 
is usually two inches. To avoid mistakes it is best to gauge a line 
lengthwise of the rafter at this distance from the top edge and 
apply the square, in laying out the rafter, to this line rather than 
to the edge. 
For a slant or shed roof the method is the same, but the whole 
width of the building is taken on the blade, while the vertical dis- 
tance between the front and rear plates is taken on the tongue. 
Laying Out Braces.—The square has a brace measure which 
gives the lengths of braces commonly used in framing. The table 
  Fia. 55.—Section of blade of steel square showing brace measure table. 
(Fig. 55) is arranged with the numbers representing the rise and 
tun printed one over the other, while the length of the brace appears 
at their right; $$ 50.91 meaning that with a rise and run of 36 
inches each, the length of the diagonal or brace would be 50.91 
inches.

  DIVIDING A BOARD INTO STRIPS OF EQUAL WIDTH 37 
Octagon or “ eight square ” scale is found on the side of the 
tongue opposite the brace measure table. Figure 56 suggests its use. 
Another method often used in laying out an eight-sided stick is to 
lay the blade of the square or a two-foot rule diagonally across the 
stick as shown in figure 57, marking at the points 7 inches and 
17 inches. 
Securing Angle Cuts for Common Polygons.—By using the 
square as indicated in figure 58 the cuts for making the common 
regular polygons can be obtained. A regular polygon of any size 
can be laid out by making the length of the side to suit, the angle 
of cut remaining the same whatever the size may be.

Geometrical Constructions Useful in Farm Carpentry.—It 
is often desirable to erect perpendiculars or lay out regular poly- 
gons when making things for the farm. Some of the more common 
constructions follow. They can be laid out with the dividers, or in 
cases where a larger figure is desired, they can be laid out on a

CONVENTIONAL BREAKS AND SYMBOLS 49 
Laying Out a Drawing.—The first steps in laying out a draw- 
ing are to decide what views will be required to show the object 
clearly and to determine their size. For example, if an object 10 feet 
wide and 20 feet long is to be drawn in a space 514 x 101% inches it 
is obvious that it will be necessary to use a scale no greater than 14 
inch = 1 foot. The above computation may be made by the fol- 
lowing rule: 
Rule——Multiply the scale used, expressed as a fraction, by the length 
of the object to be drawn in feet. The result will equal the actual length 
of the drawing in inches.

Isometric and oblique projection drawings are made in an 
inclined position so that three faces of the object, usually the top, 
front, and right side, are shown. This type of drawing is useful 
where only a general idea of an object with the principal dimensions 
is required. 
The isometric drawing has three axes about which the picture is 
made; one is vertical and the other two each form an angle of 30 
degrees with the horizontal. This skeleton is shown in figure 86. In 
oblique projection (Fig. 87) one axis is vertical, one horizontal, and

the other inclined at any angle desired, although 30 degrees is com- 
monly used because of convenience. This method of projection 
permits one side of the object to be drawn in its true shape. To 
avoid the appearance of excessive thickness, apparent in oblique 
drawings, all measurements that extend away from the observer 
may be divided by two, and when so made drawings are termed 
cabinet projections. When making an oblique drawing choose for 
the horizontal view that side of the object containing circles and 
irregular work that would be difficult to draw in an inclined position. 
Sketching.—Frequently a clear pencil sketch, approximating 
closely the shape of the object, and provided with the neces- 
sary dimensions, is all that is needed. Make as many views as 
are required to show the work clearly, place them in the proper 
relation to each other, and provide them with sufficient explanatory 
notes and dimensions to make them clear.

examine the plan, front and side views of the assembly in the 
effort to get at the general shape of the object shown, trying to 
visualize the three views combined as a whole. 
After the use and general shape of the object as a whole and the 
shape, relation, and purpose of its parts have been determined, the 
dimensions may be examined. Constant study of the explanatory 
notes on the drawing is also necessary to read it properly. The 
most important point, however, is to see the object complete in the 
mind’s eye by study of the title and assembly views. With this 
picture before one it is easy to decipher the shape and size of the 
various parts and their relation to each other.

  CHAPTER VI 
SELECTION, USE, AND CARE OF LUMBER 
Crrvrarn qualities of lightness, stiffness, strength, and heat insu- 
lation are possessed by lumber in a marked degree. It lends itself 
readily to a wide variety of decorative treatments, is easily worked, 
can be obtained in numerous grades and varieties, and has a second- 
hand value. These qualities of convenience, adaptability, and 
_ economy make it of great value in making farm alterations 
and repairs. 
Manner of Growth.—Practically all of the lumber used on the 
farm is cut from trees of the exogenous group, which increase their 
girth by adding a new layer of wood fiber 
around their trunk, beneath the bark, each 
year. This new growth is called the “annual 
ring” (Fig. 88). 
Heart-wood and Sap-wood.—As 
growth progresses in the stem the inner 
wood, known as “ heart-wood,” turns darker 
in color, and becomes stiffer and stronger. 
It contains less moisture, warps and shrinks 
less, and is more resistant to decay than Fic. 88.—Heart-wood in ges yi center, sap-wood around it. 
“sap-wood,” which is the outer, lighter- Rings’ and medullary rays 
colored portion cut from the same tree. Sere 
The sap-wood of hickory is valuable because of its toughness, while 
that of basswood is desired because of its light color. 
Medullary Rays.—Radiating outward from the pith of the tree 
are the “ pith rays,” or “ medullary rays.” These rays vary greatly 
in appearance with the species of wood, being almost invisible in 
some of the pines and standing out very clearly in the oaks, making 
the peculiar flake in quarter-sawed oak. With the annual rings, they 
help in giving each wood its characteristic grain. Both the rings 
and the rays have much to do with the successful drying of wood. 
Sawing.—Two general methods of sawing are in use: termed 
“slash sawing ” and “ quarter sawing” (Figs. 89 and 90). 
53   
 
-P-A-G-E-68
  54 SELECTION, USE AND CARE OF LUMBER 
Much of the lumber used for furniture-making is “quarter 
sawed,” as it shrinks and warps but little, and in some woods, as 
oak, it presents a beautiful grain. The flakes in quarter-sawed oak 
are due to the medullary 
rays being uncovered by 
a saw-cut parallel to 
their face. 
Shrinkage.—Practi- 
cally all shrinkage is in 
a direction parallel with 
5 Por the annual rings. This Fra. 89.—Plan of slash Fra, 90. y i sawing of lumber from a ter sawing of a log at A. 1s termed tangential log. Modified plans also shown. ‘ : shrinkage, and is about 
twice as great as radial shrinkage, which takes place from the 
center of the log outward, along the medullary rays. There is 
practically no change in length when drying. A board cut from 
the center of a log will shrink 
little in width, the principal shrink- 
age being in thickness, and there 
will be little tendency to warp or

part of the log have the annual rings i

more or less parallel with their face fie. 91.—Shrinkage of lumber and 
and will shrink excessively when dry- bate hrs ampere 
ing (Fig. 91). This is due both to the position of the rings and to 
the high water content. 
Seasoning.—A tree when cut contains from 20 to 60 per cent 
of water, the amount depending upon the variety, the age of the 
tree, the season when cut, and other factors. This surplus moisture 
must be driven off, the process being termed seasoning. Seasoning 
of lumber is very important, as it makes it stronger, stiffer, and 
lighter, more nearly permanent in size and shape, and more resistant 
to decay. It is accomplished by two general methods: (1) air-dry- 
ing and (2) kiln-drying. 
In air-drying the lumber is piled so that the air can circulate 
freely through it, and is left for a period of time varying from

three months to two years or more. Lumber dried in this way will 
have the moisture content reduced to that of the outside air, 7. e., 
12 to 15 per cent, and is suitable for outside work, framing, and 
rough interior alterations.

For interior finish or other work where shrinkage must be elimi- 
nated, the lumber is kiln-dried by being piled loosely in a highly 
heated room, through which a hot blast of air with controlled 
moisture content is kept circulating. Air-dried lumber can be 
thoroughly seasoned by this method in a period of time varying with 
the nature, thickness, and condition of the wood. In general, soft 
woods require from two to four days for each inch in thickness, 
while hard woods need from two to three times as long. 
Small pieces of lumber can be seasoned for shop use by storing 
them in a heated room in such a way that the air can circulate 
readily about them, making sure that the pieces are so supported 
that there is no opportunity for them to warp or bend in drying. 
Lumber stored in an attic through the summer is usually suffi- 
ciently dry for all farm repairs. Where stock is dried rapidly the 
ends should be sealed by an application of thick paint or oil to 
prevent checking. :

which is equal to 1000 feet board measure. The contents of a board 
or a stick of timber, in board feet, are obtained by the following rule: 
Multiply the length in feet by the width in feet by the thickness in 
inches. In the case of 1-inch boards 12 feet long, the number of 
board feet is equal to the width of the board in inches; a 1-inch 
board, 12 feet long and 6 inches wide, containing 6 board feet. Lum-

sold as though it were 1 inch thick.

CHAPTER VII 
FASTENINGS FOR WOOD 
Tue chief fasteners used in the construction and repair work of 
the farm are nails, screws, bolts, rivets, corrugated fasteners, and 
glue. These are made in a great variety, permitting the choice of a 
type suited to the work and the character of the wood being used. 
Choice of a Fastener.—The following factors should be con- 
sidered when selecting a fastener for any given piece of work: 
(1) nature of the work to be done; (2) physical properties of the 
wood to be used. Some woods, because of their extreme hardness or 
the ease with which they are split, can be nailed only with difficulty, 
making the use of screws or bolts advisable. 
Nails are the most widely used type of fasteners. The more 
commonly used kinds are common nails, box nails, flooring nails, 
casing nails, finishing nails, and roofing nails (Fig. 97). 
Designation of Nail Sizes——With the exception of roofing 
nails the size is designated by the term “ penny,” written “d.” 
This designation refers to the length only, the thickness or gauge 
varying with the type of nail.   Length, gauge and approximate number per pound of common nails

Nails of lighter gauge wire will run somewhat more to the pound. 
Driving Nails—Nails should be hit squarely on the head with 
the center of the hammer face when driving. This prevents bend-

placing nails. Lubricating nail-points with soap or wax tends to 
prevent trouble with bending.
-P-A-G-E-76
  62 FASTENINGS FOR WOOD 
Prevention of Splitting—When nailing hard wood prevent 
splitting by selecting nails of a size suited to the work. Start 
the nail with the edge of the point across the grain (Big. 99))s 
This cuts the grain and does not 
wedge the wood fibers apart so 
badly. 
Setting Nails.—Casing or fin- 
ishing nails are used where it is 
desirable to set the nails, to permit 
the finishing of the surface. After

Toe-nailing.—Where it is desired to fasten a piece that butts 
up against another by nailing, it can be done as shown in figure 101.

Finishing—interior finish and cabinet work. 
Casing—heavier work than finishing nails. 
Flooring—blind nailing of floors. 
Cut—open and blind nailing of floors. 
Roofing (barbed, smooth, galvanized )—prepared roofing. 
Wood Screws.—Where a more secure fastening is desired than 
can be provided with nails, or where it may be necessary to take the 
joint apart occasionally, screws are used as a means of fastening. 
They are made from a number of materials, as iron, brass, and

bright (written F.H.B.), is the one most commonly used. The size 
of wood screws is designated by the length in inches and the 
diameter, expressed in numbers of the American Screw Gauge. 
Driving Screws.—When driving screws a hole (Fig. 105) 
should be bored to the depth of the shank of the screw large enough 
to permit the screw to be pushed through it. Determine size with 
a caliper. The portion of the hole occupied by the threaded part of 
the screw should be made with a smaller drill to cause the thread to 
engage the wood. If the screws to be used are of the flat-head type 
the holes should also be countersunk. Use as large a screw-driver 
as the head of the screw will allow, and one filed to fit the slot in the 
screw (Fig. 106). Apply a lubricant, as soap, to the thread of the 
screw, and where possible clamp the work in a vise before drawing 
it up to secure a tighter fit. 
Coach screws, or lag screws, are heavy wood screws fitted with a 
square head to permit turning with a wrench. ‘Their size is desig- 
nated by the diameter and length, both expressed in inches. The 
length is measured as shown in figure 107A. They are often used to 
hold machinery in place. 
Bolts are used where greater siciuiti is desired than can be 
obtained with nails or screws or 
where it may be desired to con- 
struct an, object that can be 
quickly taken down or set up, 
as a take-down shipping crate. 
The ones commonly used on the 2 
farm are made in three styles, 
carriage bolts, machine bolts, 
and stove bolts (Fig. 107B).

  66 FASTENINGS FOR WOOD 
They are driven into the back of the work and hold the parts 
in position. 
Glue is used where the pieces to be joined are too small to permit 
the use of any other fastener, or where an invisible joint is desired. 
It is prepared from a number of substances, the best for wood 
joining being made from ox-hides. While a good hot glue is the

the farm shop because of its convenience, and because of the experi- 
ence and skill required to prepare and use hot glue successfully. 
For woodwork not lower than a No. 1% grade should be used. 
Dependence should not be placed on the color when making a selec- 
tion, as frequently a dark-colored hide glue will show more strength 
than a light-colored one that may have been through a bleaching 
process. Sheet glue is not always better than a pulverized one, as 
many suppose. It is possible to prepare any grade of glue in 
any form. 
Preparing and Using Glue—A pound of No. 1% glue will 
take up from 114 to 2 pounds of water. This should be applied cold 
and allowed to stand until the glue softens. After soaking, the glue 
should be dissolved by heating at a temperature not to exceed 150 
degrees F. The work to be glued should be dry, clean, perfectly 
fitted, and warm, the hot glue being quickly applied and the work 
clamped up to dry. Coat all meeting surfaces thoroughly, but do not 
apply glue in excess. It should stand for at least 24 hours before 
being worked upon, the time depending somewhat upon the weather.

Job 1. The miter box is useful for sawing moulding or small 
material to which it is difficult to fit a square. It may also be used 
for cutting a number of small pieces to a uniform length, as when 
cutting the slats for a potato crate (Fig. 110).

Construction.—1l. Reduce the pieces to the finished dimensions by 
jointing the edges and squaring the ends. 
2. Drill and countersink back for four No. 10 F. H. B. screws. Arrange 
screws in staggered position as shown for the front to secure greater 
strength and to prevent splitting. 
3. Set the marking gauge at 14’ and gauge a line on the inside of 
front, %4”" up from lower edge. This indicates the amount that the front 
projects below the bottom. With this line as a guide, drill and countersink 
screw holes as for the back. 
4, Apply glue thinly to meeting surfaces, tack in position or clamp in 
the vise and assemble with screws. Clamp in vise near the screw that is being 
turned in to permit drawing up tight. 
5. At a point 3’ from the right-hand end of the miter box, square 
across the top, being sure that the blade of the square bears firmly against 
the box. Also square down to the bottom on both sides from the point 
where this line intersects the upper edges. Saw carefully down to the 
bottom on these lines. 
6: Lay off 3’ from the left-hand end and locate the point A. Place the 
square across the top of the miter box so that the figure 12 on the blade 
coincides with the point A and swing it until the figure 12 on the tongue 
coincides with the same edge. With the square held in this position mark 
along the blade marking the cuts at A and B. 
7. Carefully square across from A and locate the point C. 
8. Hold the square at C as it was held at A and mark the points C

Job 2. The straight edge is used for a guide when drawing 
lines for straightening the irregular edges of boards, and to provide 
a level seat against rough timbers which do not present a good bear- 
ing surface for the comparatively short length of the level. Level 
or perpendicular lines can also be projected from point to point by 
means of the straight edge and level (Fig. 110). 
Stock List 
1 piece of straight grained pine, 1” by 6-14” by 10’ long surfaced on 
4 sides (S48). 
1 round head blued wood screw, 7%’’, No. 10. 
1 staple tack. 
Construction.—l. Select a straight-grained pine board of sufficient 
size, and smooth plane both sides lightly to remove planer marks. 
2. Select a second straight-grained board of equal length. To secure 
a straight edge two edges must be jointed at one time. 
3. Clamp the boards together and place in the vise with the grain 
running to the left as the workman stands facing the bench. 
4, See that the jointer is keen and is set to take a light uniform 
shaving across the full width of the bit. Joint both boards carefully at 
one time. 
5. Keep the edges square by making frequent tests with the try 
square. 
6. Test roughly for straightness by sighting along the edge. 
7. When edge is apparently straight by sighting test, separate the 
boards and place the test board upon the straight edge with the two jointed 
edges together. Mark the points which touch for further planing. 
8. If the above test does not show a perfect edge replace the boards 
together and continue jointing and testing as above until no light can be 
seen between the edges when placed together. 
9. When the working edge has been jointed straight, joint the other 
edge parallel to it, making the straight edge 6” wide. 
10. Measure the length and square and cut the ends. 
1l. Set the sliding tee bevel at 45 degrees and mark and cut the 
corners as indicated in the drawing. 
12. Set the gauge at 3” and using the working edge as a guide gauge 
a line the whole length of the straight edge 3” from the edge. 
13. Directly in this line and 12” from the end bore a 1’ hole. 
14. Extending from this hole toward the center of the straight edge 
make a saw kerf about 1” long in this gauge line. At the base of the saw 
kerf turn in a %”’, No. 10 round head wood screw. Turn the slot parallel 
with the gauge line and dress it out with a slim taper file. The saw kerf 
forms a means for attaching the line supporting the plumb-bob while the 
screw head supports it so that it swings free from the board. 
15. With a point in the gauge line 12” from the other end as a 
center bore a 2” hole with the expansive bit and lay out and cut to the 
shape shown with the compass saw. This forms an opening for the plumb- 
bob to swing in. The line is prevented from swinging too far and becoming 
tangled when carrying by the staple placed over it as shown.

16. Locate and square a line across the center of the straight edge. 
17. Set the gauge at 3-34” and using it against the working edge, 
gauge a short line across the one just made with the square to serve as 
a center line for the handle. 
18. Set the expansive bit at 1-14” and with points in the gauge line 
just made 1-%4” on either side of the center line, bore two holes forming 
the ends of the handle. 
19. Set the gauge at 1-14” and gauge a line forming the upper edge 
of the handle. The lower edge coincides with the line first gauged 3” 
from the working edge. 
20. Remove the waste wood in the handle by making two parallel cuts 
with the compass saw along these gauge lines. 
21. Smooth up the inside of the handle and plumb-bob opening with the 
wood rasp, removing sharp corners. 
22. Give at least two coats of good out-door paint to lessen absorption 
of moisture and possible change of shape. 
23, Arrange supports on interior wall surface so that it may be stored 
without warping. Edge may be made of different lengths to fit work at 
hand but if made longer, the width should be increased to prevent springing 
when in use. 
Job 3. A saw-filing clamp is necessary to hold saws while 
being fitted. For emergency use it can be quickly made by using a 
wedge to tighten the swinging jaw instead of the cam lever shown 
(Fig. 111).

Job 4. Saw-horse.—Horses or trestles are necessary to support 
work under construction in the shop. They are also used about the 
farm when making repairs or alterations for the same purpose. A 
good horse should be light, strong, and rigid. The trussed con- 
struction of the one shown gives it these qualifications (Fig. 112).

Construction—1. Rip saw and joint material to widths required. 
2. Square and cut top to length. Lay out gains for legs by gauging 
lines 1” from edge on each side of top. See isometric detail. 
3. Apply sliding tee bevel to steel square and set at 5-5%” on blade 
and 2-*/,./’ on tongue to secure angles for leg. Or, on wall board, make 
full size drawing of one half of end view by making vertical center line 
and laying off % width of top and bottom at right angles to this at a 
distance of 1 foot 10-%4” apart. An oblique line connecting these points 
will then give the length of the leg and the angle at which it should be cut. 
4. With bevel set as above, project lines across the end of top con- 
necting the under side with the gauge lines just made. Set the gauge to 
the point where the oblique lines across the end of top meet the under 
surface and gauge lines at this distance from the edge back the width 
of the leg, 4-14”. Square the top 4-14” from the end, cut to gauge lines 
with saw, forming shoulders, and with rip saw cut along gauge lines, 
removing waste wood. Make all saw cuts in waste wood. 
5. With sliding tee bevel set at same angle lay out and cut 4 legs, 
2 feet long. 
6. Using same angle, layout and cut end braces. As thicknesses of 
boards vary slightly, secure tight fit in halved joint by placing board to 
be used as truss in position over end brace and marking on each side with 
a sharp knife joint. A tight joint is essential. Should too snug a fit be 
secured it can be relieved by smooth-planing lightly. 
7. Lay ouit and make truss which goes under top. Cut curves at ends 
with compass saw or jig saw. The same precautions should be observed 
in making the halved joints that were taken when making the end braces. 
8. Drill and countersink legs and end braces to take the screws listed. 
9. Assemble legs and top, applying glue to meeting surfaces and 
testing with steel square to see that leg stands perpendicular to top. If 
screw points are dipped in oil they should turn into soft wood without 
drilling. If drilling is necessary because of dense, pitchy wood, use drill 
smaller than was used for body of screw to enable screw threads to hold,

Job 5.—A mallet is a necessity when beating out mortises with 
a chisel, as the use of a hammer on a chisel handle destroys the 
handle. It is also useful in making repairs to farm machinery, 
driving in bushings and marking gaskets, where the use of a ham- 
mer might cause injury to the surface struck. The mallet shown 
can be made either with or without the sole leather face (Fig. 113).

too large. d 
5. Lay out mallet head to shape shown in side view and cut to shape. 
The use of miter box is advised. 
6. Remove construction marks by planing and run a */,:" chamfer all 
around. If desired sole leather face can be inserted by locating center 
by means of diagonals, setting the expansive bit at 2-14” and boring to a 
depth equal to the thickness of the sole leather. Soak leather and cut 
circle with washer cutter if available, otherwise use thin sharp knife. 
Apply glue to mallet face and pound leather into position. Fasten with

Job 6.—Bolt, Nail, and Screw Cabinet.—There is a continual 
need on the farm for nails, screws, staples, and bolts of various sizes ; 
making it necessary to carry a supply of these articles in assorted 
sizes. The cabinet shown keeps them separate and in a convenient 
manner for use, as the till containing the size needed can be removed 
from the cabinet and carried to the bench. The contents of the

Construction.—1. Joint sides to size desired, square and cut to length. 
Where material cannot be secured in sufficient width to make sides of 
cabinet, sides can be built up of narrower stock and secured by cleats 
placed beneath top of cabinet and directly below bottom shelf. 
2. Lay out and cut grooves */,; deep for housing ends of shelves. Lay 
out and cut semi-circular piece from bottom with compass saw or jig 
saw and make joint for front at top as shown in detail of joint at “A”. 
Grooves can be cut on circular saw, if available. If not, gauge line along 
each edge */,,.’ from inside surface, clamp or nail lightly a short piece of 
board across the stock where cut is to be made and using this as a guide 
saw down to the gauge marks being careful to keep the saw cuts in the 
waste wood. Remove the waste wood by paring with a chisel. 
3. Joint shelf edges. Square and cut to proper length. Shelves can be 
built up of narrower stock if necessary. 
4. Place bottom and top shelves in position and nail in place. If 
available apply glue to meeting edges. Rip out and joint a piece */," 
material 1-°/,/’ wide to go across front. Square, cut to length and nail 
in place. 
5. Lay out and cut top to size and nail in place. 
6. Make middle top shelf partition and fit it carefully in place making 
sure that it is exactly in the center. 
7. By use of steel square beneath top shelf adjust the cabinet frame 
to square position and hold it so by means of temporary diagonal brace 
nailed across the front from corner to corner. 
8. Measure carefully the length of the diagonal braces for the cabinet 
and obtain the angles of cut at the top and bottom. This is most easily done 
by turning the cabinet on its face and applying the braces directly to 
the back in position for measuring and laying out angles. Cut to size 
and nail firmly in place with 6d common nails. See that cabinet is square 
while doing this. Temporary brace can now be removed. 
9, Cut remainder of top shelf partitions and nail in place. Fasten 
bottoms by nailing up through from shelf beneath. 
10. Insert second shelf and after nailing cut and nail partitions as 
before. Insert each shelf in turn, putting in and nailing partitions before 
next shelf is inserted. Tops of partitions are fastened by driving a nail 
at front and back obliquely through the shelf above into the top of 
the partition. 
11. Lay out and construct drawer fronts as shown in detail using cir- 
cular saw, if available. If not, construct rabbet around edges by sawing 
down to proper depth in miter box and after gauging around edge remove 
waste wood with chisel. Make chamfer on front of till with plane. 
12, Cut back for drawers 5-14" x 5-14” as shown in detail. 
13. From light weight galvanized iron or roofing tin, cut sheets 
16-14" x 11-\%%". Fold over a 4%" seam on each 11-14” edge leaving a 
sheet 16” x 11-14". Bend this sheet at right angles 5-4” from each 
12” edge, forming sides and bottom of drawer. Square corners’ can be 
bent by first marking location and then clamping metal between boards. 
After bending bottom, put back and front in position and nail in place 
with 3d common nails. 
14, Fasten drawer pulls to drawer fronts. Spools cut in two may be 
used for drawer pulls or cheap japanned pulls obtained at the hard- 
ware store.

Job. 7.—Tool Board.—Where tools are in constant use a means 
of storing should be adopted that will be convenient, protect, 
their edges and indicate the exact place that a tool should go when 
returned to the shop. Order and neatness in the shop increase the 
service that may be obtained from it and the tool equipment. The 
tool board is preferably made open as shown (Fig. 115) but, where 
necessary, can be built with deeper sides and fitted with doors of 
Y-inch mesh galvanized wire screening which permits locking up 
the tool equipment.

Job 9.—Farm Bench.—Construction and repair work can best 
be done on a solid, plane surface such as is provided by the top of a 
good bench. Farm shop work is of a varied nature, involving both 
wood and metal work, and the bench should provide for both. 
The bench shown has a strong vise with iron plates set in the 
meeting surfaces of the jaws permitting its use, to a certain extent, 
in metal work. The use of a 27x 2” angle iron for this pur- 
pose, extending it along the front edge of the bench, is a desirable 
construction for a bench to be used much in repair work, as it 
provides a surface upon which bolts and nails may be straightened 
and a cold chisel used for cutting. The addition of a steel vise is 
advisable where it can be obtained (Figs. 117 and 118).

gauge short lines on each side of the cross sill intersecting the line just 
squared across. Bore %’’ holes at these intersections, corresponding to 
holes in upper ends of legs. In boring holes in separate pieces that are 
to be joined it is essential that the work be laid out and bored from the 
meeting surfaces. To secure a good appearance as well, all work should 
be laid out on both sides and worked from both sides to the center. 
13. Lay out and bore rear end of cross sill for vise end of bench in 
same manner as for one just made. For end next to vise bore 1” hole 
through center of cross sill, 6-14" from end. Obtain the center of the end

Construction.—l. Set the dividers at a radius of 4-%” and lay out 
two 9” circles on straight grained pine or basswood stock, S28. 
2. With the compass saw or jig saw, cut out these circles being careful 
to follow the line and to keep the edge square with the stock. 
3. Set the dividers at 3-34” radius and with the same center describe 
a second circle on one of the pieces just cut out. 
4, With the same radius step around this circumference, dividing it 
into 6 equal parts, locating the positions of the screws holding the two 
parts of the top together. 
5. Drill and countersink at these points for 1-4”, No. 9 F. H. B. 
wood screws. 
6. Apply glue to meeting surfaces, place the pieces comprising the 
top together with the grain of the wood crossing at right angles and fasten 
with screws. Set aside to dry. When driving screws clamp the piece in 
the vise near the screw being turned in. This permits the work to be 
drawn up much tighter. 
7. From straight grained ash or hickory, split 3 legs 1” x 1” x 12” 
Jong. Wood can be split straighter by splitting each time through the 
center until the size desired is obtained rather than by attempting to split 
a small piece from the side of a large block. 
8. With plane reduce pieces to %” x %”. 
9. Plane off corners making piece octagonal. 
10. Again remove corners making piece 16 sided and finish round with

12. Make a 1-%” saw kerf with compass saw in top of each leg as 
shown in “ section through leg joint.” 
13. Prepare wedges for these saw kerfs as indicated. 
14, When top is dry finish edge by means of sharp spoke shave set to 
take a light shaving. Finish to true circle. Keep edge at right angles to 
face by frequent tests with try square. 
15. Run a 1%” chamfer clear around top and bottom edges as shown. 
16. Set dividers at the same radius used in laying out the circle for 
the screws and starting at a point in this circumference midway between 
two of the screws, again step around this circle. 
17. Selecting every alternate one of these points, draw lines through 
them to the center of the circle forming the center lines in which the legs 
are located. Mark these lines on the edge of the stool so that their position 
may be determined when they are covered by the boring jig. 
18. Place the boring jig in position with center screw turned into 
center of stool top from beneath. Turn about this point until its center 
line coincides with one of the marks made on the edge of the stool top. 
19. Clamp the top and boring jig in the vise and with a %” bit inserted 
in the guide, bore a hole for the leg. Repeat for the remaining 2 legs. 
Guide of boring jig should be made of such length that the bit will not 
bore through stool top when turned in full length. 
20. Coat wedges, ends of stool legs and hole in stool top with glue and, 
placing top on smooth, hard surface, drive legs into place. Start legs 
with wedges placed diagonally across grain to avoid splitting either upper 
or under part of top. If desired, legs may be secured by inserting a 1-14”, 
No. 9 F. H. B. screw into end from the top. In this case do not place saw 
kerf in top of leg. 
21. Set stool on level surface and, if necessary, block under short leg 
until stool top stands parallel with surface upon which legs rest. 
22, Measure from upper surface of top to surface upon which stool 
stands. 
23. Subtract 1114” (stool height) from this measurement and set divi- 
ders at the difference obtained. 
24, With dividers set at this difference, scribe around the bottom of each 
leg as the stool stands in this position. 
25. Cut legs off on these scribed marks. 
26. Smooth up work by sand papering and apply a priming coat of paint. 
27. When dry, putty defects, if any, and apply a coat of light gray 
auto enamel or other durable high gloss paint.

Job. 5.—Adjustable Ditcher’s Square—When digging ditch 
for laying tile some means is necessary for measuring down from 
the overhead line to the ditch bottom in order that a smooth tile 
base may be prepared, parallel with the line (Fig. 132). 
The adjustable square shown is convenient, as it may be set to 
varying heights. The horizontal arm projects beneath the line 
stretched up at the side of the ditch, parallel with its length, while 
the upright part serves as a depth gauge.

Job. 8.—Adjustable Bag-holder.—The use of grain as feed is 
universal on farms regardless of the type of farming carried on. In 
feeding, it is seldom fed as bought, but is mixed to form the ration 
in use and then rebagged for more convenient handling. The bag- 
holder described is very convenient for this purpose, as it holds all 
bags securely, regardless of shape (Fig. 140).

CHAPTER XIII 
PAINTING AND GLAZING 
Tue barn and outbuildings of the modern farm represent a 
considerable investment, upon which depreciation should be reduced 
toaminimum. A large sum is also invested in machines and imple- 
ments for field work. The present yearly depreciation is estimated 
at 10 per cent, and is largely due to weathering rather than wear. 
A protective coating of paint lessens this depreciation. 
Effects of Paint.—A frequent use of a well selected paint forms 
a waterproof covering, which tends to prevent rusting and decay 
caused by moisture. The operator will also give a well painted 
implement better care. 
Painted surfaces are more easily kept clean, improving sanita- 
tion. Lighting is improved by the use of light colored paints. 
Composition of Paints.—A paint consists of a combination of 
a base, vehicle, and pigment, designed to give protection and to 
beautify the object to which it is applied. A solvent and drier is 
sometimes added. 
Base.—The base is the portion of the paint designed to give 
body and covering capacity to the paint. White lead is the standard 
base for out-of-door paints. 
Vehicle.—The liquid in which the base is carried is called the 
vehicle. Linseed oil is the vehicle used in first-class grades of com- 
mercial paints, because it has the property of absorbing oxygen and 
hardening to a tough, horn-like surface. 
Linseed oil is obtainable in two conditions: “raw oil” and 
“hoiled oil.” The latter is prepared by heating and adding certain 
chemicals, making it darker, thicker, and more rapid in drying. 
Boiled oil is generally used in inside work. Raw oil is lighter 
colored and somewhat slower in drying. It is considered more 
durable and is usually specified for outside work. 
Pigment is the finely ground color used in paint to give it the 
color desired. It may be either in powder or paste form. The paste 
colors are most easily mixed with the paint. They should be mixed 
smoothly with turpentine before being added to the paint. 
Solvent.—Turpentine, a product of the southern pine, is used 
in paint for the purpose of softening up the surface resins of the 
183 
   
-P-A-G-E-198
  184 PAINTING AND GLAZING 
wood, making the paint more penetrating. It also gives the paint 
certain desirable properties of spreading, handling, and drying. An 
excess lessens durability. 
Drier.—This is a thin, varnish-like liquid, called japan drier. 
It is mixed with paint in proportions varying from 5 to 10 per 
cent of the quantity of vehicle used when it is desired to make the 
paint dry rapidly. Certain metallic oxides are contained which 
serve as carriers of oxygen and hasten the oxidation of the oil with 
which it is mixed. 
Adulterations—The nature of paint makes the detection of an 
adulterant difficult without the aid of chemical analysis. For this 
reason only good brands should be used, and these should have the 
analysis plainly printed on the container. When offered paint much 
below the market price it is an indication of adulteration. 
Mixing Paint—A satisfactory paint for general outside use 
can be made by mixing fifteen pounds of paste white lead with 
about four-fifths of a gallon of raw oil to which drier has been 
added at the rate of about 5 per cent of the vehicle used. This 
can be considered as a standard paint and can be modified by the 
addition of more oil, more lead, pigment, and turpentine to meet 
the requirements of priming or of finishing coats. Color pigments 
vary and should be tried carefully.

  SMOOTHING THE SURFACE 185 
The white lead and oil are measured out and the lead mixed to 
a thin paste with a part of the oil, stirred until smooth, and the 
remainder of the oil is then added. After the paint has been pre- 
pared the pigment is mixed with turpentine and slowly stirred into 
the paint until the desired tint is obtained (Fig. 149). 
Selection of Paint.—Paint 
for outside use can be. purchased 
in three forms. 
1. Ready prepared paste which is 
ready for use upon the addition of 
more oil. 
2. Ready prepared liquid. 
3. The base, vehicle, and pigment 
can be purchased separately and mix- 
ed on the job. 
Covering Capacity—The 
covering capacity of paint will 
vary with (1) the porosity of the 
surface, (2) the purity of the 
paint, (3) the amount of rubbing. 
Under average conditions a gallon 
of properly mixed paint will cover 
about 250 square feet, two coats. 
Equipment for Painting. — 
Equipment for painting consists 
of suitable containers, which in Fia. 149.—Adding pigment to paint to : tint it.” The color is first mixed with tur- 
the case of the prepared paints  pentine and then added to paint by pouring 
may consist of the cans in which and pu cua atily on ere Orn eeetne 
the paint was purchased, brushes oe ee 
for spreading, a putty knife, scraper, wire brushes, sand-paper, and 
dust brush for preparing the surface (Fig. 150). Where the surface 
to be painted is the side of a building, suitable staging and ladders 
are also required. 
Brushes.—A round or oval brush of the size known as 6-0, gives 
good results in applying body colors. A 5-0 brush of the same type 
is used for trim. Paint may be applied faster with a flat brush, but 
it cannot be applied as evenly as with a round brush. Select one 
with long, springy bristles, securely fastened. A good dry brush is 
carried to dust the work before applying paint. 
Smoothing the Surface.—A scraper or broad blade is used to 
remove paint scales that hold too closely to be removed with the 
   
-P-A-G-E-200
  186 PAINTING AND GLAZING 
dust brush. An assortment of sandpaper ranging from fine to coarse 
should be provided. Where an extremely smooth surface is desired, 
as in finishing a varnished surface, finer polishing mediums as steel 
wool and curled hair should be used. A putty knife should have a 
thin, flexible blade. It is used for filling imperfections with putty 
after the priming coat has been applied. 
Ladders.—A light and strong extension ladder of sufficient 
length to reach the highest points of the gable is necessary in house 
‘

painting. Short ladders, step ladders, and staging trestles are con- 
veniences in painting the side walls lower down. 
Time to Paint.—Outside painting should be done in warm 
weather. The paint is more liquid when warm and permits better 
working into the wood. If too hot, paint will “crawl.” The sur- 
face to be painted must be dry. Avoid a time when insects or fuzzy 
materials from plants are flying about to stick in the fresh paint. 
. The Priming Coat—Coat all knots and sappy places with 
orange shellac before putting on the priming coat of paint, to pre- 
vent pitch coming through. A relatively thin paint that will have 
good penetration and will dry with a flat surface is best for priming. 
This condition can be secured by adding a small quantity of turpen- 
tine. Never use ochre in priming. 
 
-P-A-G-E-201
INSIDE WORK 187 
Spreading the Paint—Apply the paint lengthwise of the wood, 
working it well into all interstices and brushing it out thin and 
evenly. The paint should be spread in strips the whole length of 
the building or between vertical divisions, as doors and windows, to 
avoid showing a lap where the new work joins the old. When 
painting a clapboarded surface draw the brush along the under edge 
of the clapboard when first taken from 
the paint to insure covering the edge 
(Fig. 151). 
Second Coat.—Permit the first 
coat to stand until thoroughly dry, 
usually from 4 to 6 days. Fill the 
nail holes and other imperfections 
with a good grade of putty, by press- 
ing it in well. 
Paint for the second coat may be 
somewhat thicker and should contain 
less turpentine. Where but two coats 
are to be used the turpentine should be 
omitted. Apply this coat as directed 
for the priming coat, brushing it out 
thin and evenly. Where the trim and 
body colors are different apply the 
light color first and work the dark 
color up to it, carrying both along 
together. f 4 Fic. 151.—Spreading paint. The

surface is desired for the finishing coat to resist weathering, and to 
give a glossy appearance, therefore, no turpentine is used. It is 
applied in the same manner as directed for the first and second coats. 
Inside Work.—The purpose of inside painting is largely deco- 
rative. The vehicle used contains a larger proportion of turpen- 
tine than should be used out-of-doors, resulting in a quick drying 
paint that hardens with a “ flat ” or dull finish. Where a porcelain- 
like finish is desired the so-called enamels are used. These consist of 
a pigment ground in varnish, which gives the brilliant surface 
wanted. Directions given by the manufacturer should be closely 
followed.

Painting Farm Equipment.—Automobile and carriage paints 
put out by reputable varnish companies are well suited for this 
work. They are obtainable in desirable colors and economical sizes, 
and are durable. 
Preparation for Painting —Wash the implement first with sal 
soda and water, using scrapers and wire brushes to remove all of the 
accumulated dirt possible. When dry, remove as many parts of the 
machine as it is convenient to do, and clean them completely of

grease, using a stiff brush and kerosene or gasoline in a tub. Do not 
do this work near an open flame of any kind, because of the danger 
of fire. 
Remove all loose paint and rust by scraping, sandpapering, or 
by the use of a stiff wire brush, and smooth the surfaces with fine 
sandpaper. The dust should now be removed with a damp, lint- 
less cloth, and the priming coat applied. 
Painting.—For the primer any good oil paint can be used, and 
the finishing coat can be applied as soon as it has dried. If an oil 
paint is used for the primer the gloss can be removed and a better 
foothold secured for the finishing coat by sandpapering lightly. 
Wood Preservation—In farm practice much lumber is used 
in direct contact with the earth or in damp places, as fence posts 
and the sills of buildings, making the most favorable conditions for 
decay. Decay of lumber is produced by low forms of plant life 
called fungi which must have moisture, air, warmth, and food to 
grow. A wood preservative acts in one of the following ways or 
through a combination of both: (1) seals the wood, keeping out air 
and moisture; (2) poisons the food supply of the fungi.
-P-A-G-E-203
  THE OPEN TANK PROCESS 189 
Under the methods of application available on the farm coal tar 
creosote seems to give the best results as a wood preservative. Three 
methods of application are commonly used: (1) the brush treat- 
ment, (2) the dipping process, (3) the open tank process. 
Brush Treatment.—This method is applicable to the sills and 
joists of buildings which are too large to be treated by dipping. The 
preservative is heated to about 200 degrees F., and applied with a

brush (Fig. 152). It should be flowed on, taking care to see that 
all checks and other inperfections are filled. 
The dipping process is adapted to the smaller timbers, such as 
fence posts. The wood to be treated is placed in a hot tar or creosote 
bath (200 degrees F.), and allowed to remain there from 5 to 15 
minutes or longer (Fig. 153). It is then removed and allowed to 
drain. Checks and imperfections are filled if timber is seasoned. 
The open tank process utilizes two tanks, in one of which the 
creosote or tar is maintained at a temperature of about 200 degrees 
F. The timbers tobe treated are placed in the hot bath and 
allowed to stay for an hour or more, when they are removed, and 
placed in the cooled bath for an equal length of time (Fig. 154). 
This method secures the deepest penetration of any method avail-

able for farm use. To secure the best penetration possible, wood to 
be treated should be peeled and thoroughly seasoned. 
Whitewash and Color Washes.—Whitewash is a paint made 
with lime as a base and water as a vehicle. It may be tinted with a 
pigment, and may also be given other characteristics of weather 
resistance, gloss, etc., by the addition of certain other ingredients. 
Because of its sanitary effect, light deflecting qualities and 
cheapness, it is a very satisfactory paint for cellars, stables, poultry

houses and other like interiors. It can be applied rapidly with 
broad, flat brushes, or by means of a sprayer. The following are 
recipes for whitewash selected from U. 8. Farmers’ Bulletin 474. 
Ordinary Whitewash.—Place 10 pounds of quicklime in a pail 
and pour over it 2 gallons of water. Cover with an old carpet and 
allow to stand for an hour. Add water to bring to a proper consist- 
ency for application, the amount depending upon whether the wash 
is to be spread with a brush or used as a spray. 
Factory Whitewash (Interiors).—(1) Place 62 pounds (1 bushel) 
of quicklime in a tight barrel and slake with 15 gallons of water. Keep 
barrel covered until steam ceases to rise. Stir occasionally to prevent 
scorching. 
2. Stir up 2-%4 pounds of rye flour in % gallon of cold water and add 
two gallons of boiling water. 
3. Dissolve 2-14 pounds of rock salt in 2-44 gallons of hot water. 
4. Mix (2) and (3) and pour into (1), stirring until well mixed.

CUTTING GLASS 191 
Weatherproof Whitewash (Exteriors)—(1) Slake 62 pounds 
quicklime in 12 gallons of hot water. 
2. Dissolve two pounds common table salt and one pound sulfate of 
zine in two gallons of boiling water. 
3. Pour (2) into (1) and add two gallons of skimmed milk and mix 
thoroughly. 
Molasses renders the lime more soluble and causes it to better pene- 
trate the surface to which it is applied. It is added in the proportion of 
one pint to five gallons of whitewash. 
A gloss resembling that of oil paint can be obtained by dissolving 
  Fie. 155.—Cutting glass. 
a pound of cheap bar soap in a gallon of boiling water and adding it to five 
gallons of thick whitewash. 
Glazing —The windows of farm buildings should be kept in 
repair. A broken light wastes heat, interferes with proper ventila- 
tion, and detracts greatly from the appearance of the building. 
The necessary equipment for glazing consists of a putty knife, a 
glass cutter, glazier’s points, and supply of glass large enough to 
permit cutting the largest lights needed. Small lights can be cut 
from the broken pieces taken from the larger windows. A smooth 
bench top and a yard stick can be used as a surface upon which 
to do the cutting, and a guide for the glass cutter. A 11% or 2-inch 
chisel is used for removing the old putty, and for setting the 
glazier’s points. 
Cutting Glass.—A cheap steel disc cutter is satisfactory for 
farm repair work. It should be frequently dipped in kerosene while 
in use to improve its cutting qualities. Make a full-sized drawing 
 
-P-A-G-E-206
  192 PAINTING AND GLAZING 
on paper of the light that it is desired to cut. This is placed beneath 
the glass, and used as a pattern. Adjust the straight edge over a 
line, and draw the cutter clear across the glass along the straight 
edge (Fig. 155), using sufficient pressure to cause it to make a 
scratch on the surface of the glass. The glass should crack along 
this line by grasping it with both hands firmly on each side of the 
line and bending it backward. If it fails to do so with reasonable 
pressure, support it with one hand, as shown in figure 156, and tap 
lightly along the scratch on the under side of the glass with the

glass cutter. Very narrow and small pieces can be broken off with 
the notches on the side of the cutter. 
Glass should be cut at least 14 inch smaller than the opening it is 
to fill, because of the slightly irregular edge secured. 
Putty is used for making a weather-tight joint between the glass 
and the sash (Fig. 157), and also for filling imperfections in wood 
work, It can be purchased at paint and hardware stores. Better 
putty can be made, however, by mixing dry whiting and white lead 
paste in about equal weights. It can be colored to match the surface 
upon which it is used by the addition of the proper pigment, and 
should be used about as soft as it can be conveniently handled.
-P-A-G-E-207
  PUTTY 193 
After mixing, it should be stored in a tight container or kept cov- 
ered with oil or water. 
Putty must not be applied to bare wood, as the oil contained in 
it is absorbed, leaving the putty as a soft dry powder on the surface. 
The pores of the wood must first be “filled” by painting or by a 
coat of shellac.

Job 1.—Repainting the Farm House.—Tools and materials 
required for the work: Numbers 5-0 and 6-0 round or oval brushes , 
sash tool, dust brush, wire brush, scraper, putty knife, hammer, 
white lead paste, raw linseed oil, turpentine, japan drier, pigment, 
shellac, putty, sandpaper, ladders, staging planks, and brackets. 
Operations.—1. Determine body and trim to be used by a study and 
comparison of color cards in connection with surroundings. 
2. Measure the exterior of the house and determine area. 
3. Order sufficient paint, oil, turpentine, etc., for the job. 
4. Clean the walls thoroughly, removing all scaling paint with scraper 
and wire brush. Smooth rough spots with sandpaper and remove dust 
with dust brush. 
5. Drive all loose nails and make necessary repairs. 
6. Coat knots and sappy places with shellac. 
7. Mix sufficient paint for the priming coat. Use but little turpentine 
if the wood is porous and absorbent. More turpentine is required for 
resinous woods. Where existing paint is in good condition, the first coat 
may be made more of the nature of the second coat and the second coat 
omitted, finishing the building with the priming and finishing coats. 
8. Apply the priming coat, beginning at the top and working downward. 
Brush it on smoothly and evenly lengthwise of the grain and rub it well 
into the wood. A good job depends upon a well laid priming coat. 
9. Permit priming coat to dry and then fill nail holes and imper- 
fections with putty, mixed as directed. 
10. Mix and apply second coat, working from the top downward as in 
priming coat and painting both trim and body at one operation. Apply 
the lighter color first and lay the others up next to it to avoid smears 
showing. 
11. Mix third coat without turpentine. Brush on smoothly as in 
preceding coats when second coat has become hard and dry. 
12. Clean the sash, removing all loose putty and any broken lights. 
13. Prime the sash. When dry replace broken lights and apply putty 
to places where missing. 
14, Paint the sash. 
15. Eaves troughs and down spouts, if new, should be cleaned with a 
cloth wet in gasoline or turpentine before painting to remove grease. The 
same applies to metal roofs. When painting piazza railings the work is 
facilitated by two working in unison, one on each side.

and chassis, 2-inch bristle brush for applying top and seat dressing, 
small quantity of aluminum bronze for rims, small quantity shellac 
to seal crevices, ground coat, color varnish, clear varnish, and top 
dressing. About one quart of each is required for the average small 
car. Avoid the use of fancy colors. The average small car pre- 
sents a better appearance when painted black. 
Operations.—1. Wash the car thoroughly with soap, water and brush 
to remove mud. 
2. Remove tires, wheels and fenders and thoroughly clean chassis 
and all parts with gasoline. Use stiff brush, wire brush or putty knife 
to remove encrusted grease. 
3. Sandpaper body lightly with fine sandpaper to remove gloss, Clean 
rust from chipped places and smooth with sandpaper. 
4. Remove road tar from underside of fenders with putty knife. Smooth 
with sandpaper. 
5. Clean top, seats and side curtains with cloth dampened with tur- 
pentine. Make necessary repairs to these parts. 
6. Clean and smooth wheels with sandpaper. The use of a paint re- 
mover or scraper may be resorted to if in very bad condition. They must 
be made clean and smooth. 
7. Wipe off top, seats, body and chassis ‘to remove dust. 
8. Apply top dressing to top, seats and curtains, following directions 
on can. 
9. Apply undercoating or primer to body and chassis. Follow direc- 
tions given by manufacturer. Spread both horizontally and vertically to 
secure an even coating. Run shellac in crevices with small brush to seal 
dust particles and to prevent getting dust into finish. 
10. When dry (24 to 36 hours) sandpaper lightly and after wiping off 
dust apply first coat of color varnish. Spread horizontally first and finish 
vertically. Use soft badger hair brush and work as little as required to 
spread it to avoid the formation of bubbles. 
11. When dry rub lightly with fine sandpaper to remove gloss. Assemble 
the car and wipe off with chamois skin dampened with turpentine to re- 
move dust particles. 
12. Apply second coat of body color, flowing it on with soft badger 
hair brush. 
13. When thoroughly dry rub over the surface with curled hair to 
remove any dust nibs that may appear. 
14, Again wipe off with chamois skin moistened with turpentine and 
flow on a coat of clear auto finish. 
15. Clean the rims thoroughly and give them a coat of rim paint or 
aluminum bronze. 
Clean garage thoroughly after the first cleaning of the car and dampen 
floor and side walls before applying finishes to keep down the dust. Use 
separate brushes for body and chassis. Choose a period of bright, warm 
weather for car painting unless the garage is provided with artificial heat. 
Do not attempt to paint car in the open air because of the dust particles,

  CHAPTER XIV 
FARM FORGE SHOP WORK 
Moprrn farm machinery is largely of iron and steel construc- 
tion, making an equipment of metal working tools necessary if 
satisfactory repairs are to be made. 
Tools Required.—The tools shown in figure 158 are considered 
necessary, although much repair work can be done with the forge, 
  Fie. 158.—Equipment for forge work: 1, forge with 14-inch fan; 2, anvil; 3, Pb. ball pene hammer; 4, 16-inch bolt tongs; 5, 16-inch straight jaw tongs; 6, post drill;

  anvil, hammer and tongs, alone. An assortment of round, square 
and flat iron should also be acquired, together with a supply of bolts 
and rivets. Punches, tongs and hot and cold chisels of various 
shapes can be made as soon as a little experience is gained. 
Arrangement of Forge, Anvil, and Tools.—The anvil should 
be placed with the horn pointing diagonally toward the forge 
(Fig. 159). The proper height for the average man is about 
30 inches.

or heel of the jaw, as at B and C, it is impossible to hold the work, 
no matter how tightly gripped. 
Work should be grasped at the end. This permits handling it 
easily upon the anvil face. When it is necessary to change ends 
with a piece of work or to secure a fresh grip with the tongs, hold 
the heated iron with the hammer and swing it about with the tongs. 
The fuel used in forge work is coke, a spongy, grayish black 
material that compacts closely and forms a dense, hot fire. It is 
nearly pure carbon and contains few impurities to attack the iron 
being heated. Coke is made directly in the forge from smithing 
coal, a high-grade bituminous coal that contains little sulfur or 
earthy matter, packs closely about the fire and forms coke rapidly 
under the action of heat. 
Requirements of a Forge Fire.—It is difficult or impossible 
to do good work with a poor fire. To secure the best results the fire

must be: (1) deep, (2) clean, (3) compact. A cross section of a 
properly built fire is shown in figure 161. 
Coke uses oxygen when burning, and if a deep, clean, compact 
fire is provided, much of the oxygen of the entering air blast will be 
exhausted before reaching the iron. This lessens the formation of 
scale and permits heating the iron to a higher temperature with- 
out burning. 
Forging operations consist of bending, upsetting, drawing out, 
welding, punching, drilling, riveting, thread-cutting, hardening,
-P-A-G-E-214
    200 FARM FORGE SHOP WORK 
tempering, and annealing. Heat makes iron soft and ductile. 
Practically all forging operations on iron can be done more rapidly 
when it is at a high heat. Steel will not stand as high 
a temperature. 
Bending.—Curves may be bent cold in light work. The iron 
should be heated when an angular bend is desired, to prevent break- 
ing. A bend of this kind is usually desired at some definite point, 
and its location should be marked with a center punch before 
heating the iron. Avoid marking with a cold chisel as it tends to 
cause the iron to crack when the bend is made. Heat to a bright red 
heat for bending. 
Upsetting is making an iron shorter and thicker, as at the end 
of a brace where the hole is to be punched. This is done by giving

are, upset, as shown at A or B. Larger pieces are often upset by 
ramming the heated end against the side of the anvil, as shown in 
figure 1620. Keep the iron straight while upsetting, and main- 
tain a high heat, making the material soft and easily worked. 
Strike heavy blows. Light blows have little upsetting effect, simply 
forming a burr or rivet head on the end of the iron (Fig. 162). To 
lessen the trouble from bending confine the heat in the iron to the 
portion that it is desired to enlarge. If the heated part becomes too 
long shorten it by dipping in water to the point desired.
-P-A-G-E-215
    PUNCHING 201 
Drawing out is used to make an iron longer and thinner, and is 
most readily accomplished across the horn of the anvil (Fig. 163). 
The rounded surface of the horn acts as a blunt wedge which tends 
to stretch the iron lengthwise as it is pounded from above. Keep the

or by draw filing (Fig. 165), if a smooth surface is desired. 
Punching.—The iron is brought to a white heat and the punch 
is driven about half-way through as it lays on the face of the anvil 
in the same way that a nail is driven into a board (Fig. 166). It is

while in use to prevent its temper being destroyed, and the edges 
should be kept sharp and square by frequent fitting. 
To punch a large hole in a small piece of metal, use a small 
punch first and stretch the hole so formed by following with larger 
punches. Square holes can be made by the use of a small round 
punch followed by a square one of the size desired. 
Where a hole is being punched in an iron of considerable thick- 
ness a pinch of coal dust dropped in the hole will prevent the punch 
from sticking. 
Welding.— Wrought iron and mild steel have a considerable 
temperature range through which they are pasty and will unite if

brought together and hammered, but the higher carbon steels pre- 
sent difficulties in welding that make a higher degree of skill neces- 
sary for a successful union. There are a number of forms of welds 
in use, as the lap weld, butt weld, and jump weld (Fig. 167), used 
for special purposes. The lap weld is the principal one used in 
farm practice. 
Scarfing.—Before welding, the ends of the irons to be joined 
must be shaped for the purpose or “scarfed” (Fig. 168). The 
ends are first upset, as at A. The upset end is then held as shown 
at B, and by striking backward and downward, it is given a blunt 
wedge shape. Next lay the iron flat across the face of the anvil 
with the edge of this wedge vertical, as at C, and form the scarf 
or meeting surface by striking in the same manner used for forming 
the wedge. This brings the iron down to a blunt point of the shape
-P-A-G-E-218
  204 FARM FORGE SHOP WORK 
shown at D. The scarf is finished by giving it a slightly convex 
surface by a few light blows from the hammer. The convex shape 
insures that the irons will meet first in the center of the weld and 
squeeze out any scale or other impurities from between them as the 
welding progresses, resulting in a strong weld. The upsetting is

done to provide sufficient material for the drawing out and waste 
due to hammering and scale. 
The length of the scarf should be about 114 times the diameter 
of the iron being welded, a 34-inch rod requiring a scarf about 114 
inches in length. A common mistake of beginners is to make too 
long and pointed a scarf, due to pounding at too flat an angle when 
forming it. This results in a weak weld of poor appearance. 
The fire for welding must be deep, clean, and compact, and 
free from fresh coal. Fresh coal contains a certain amount of sul- 
fur, which makes the iron slippery at welding heat, and prevents a 
weld being made. Welding requires a high temperature, and a 
sufficient heat cannot be obtained in a loose, shallow, and dirty fire 
without excessive scaling or burning of the iron. 
Heating the Iron.—The irons should be placed in the upper 
part of the fire, with the scarfed sides up. Use a light blast in 
heating. This prevents excess air being forced into the fire, lessens 
scaling and permits the iron to be heated uniformly clear through. 
A heavy blast may result in a surface heat only. Watch the work 
closely and secure an equal heat on the pieces being welded by
-P-A-G-E-219
  TAKING THE IRONS FROM THE FIRE 205 
changing their positions in the fire if necessary. The pieces must 
be heated equally to weld. Dip the points of the scarfs in water 
if they heat too rapidly, to prevent burning. When a bright red 
heat has been reached a flux may be applied. This lessens the for- 
mation of scale and permits a weld to be made at a somewhat 
lower heat. 
The Welding Heat.—At this heat the iron becomes the same 
color as the glowing fire and seems to disappear in it. The heated 
portions are white and wet appearing, like a snowball that has been 
carried for a long time in the hands, and if the irons are touched 
together in the fire a portion of the surface will flow from one to 
the other, causing them to stick. If heated much beyond this point 
white, explosive sparks will appear, indicating that the iron is 
burning. With steel this high temperature cannot always be 
reached because of its higher carbon content. In general, welding 
should be done at the highest heat possible; a common trouble with 
beginners is attempting to weld when the iron is too cold. If the 
irons do not stick at the first blow, reheat them, as further pound- 
ing is useless. 
Taking the Irons from the Fire.—Just before the welding heat

hand is now free, and the hammer, which should have been in 
place on the anvil, is picked up and a blow struck uniting the two 
pieces. After the first blow the points of the scarfs should be welded 
down, as because of their small size they will be the first to drop 
below the welding heat. 
When stuck together the weld is reheated to the welding point, 
and worked down square to the size desired (Fig. 168), next it is 
made octagonal, and round as described under drawing out. What- 
ever the finished shape is to be it should first be made square; 
attempting to work the weld round at once will result in opening it. 
Where the pieces of iron are both short, necessitating the use of two 
pair of tongs, the tongs held by the right hand are released and 
dropped when the left hand iron is brought down on top of the iron 
held by them. 
  Fluxes.—A flux is a powder or paste used to make welding 
easier. It accomplishes this result in two ways: 1. It melts on the 
heated iron and flows over it, providing a protective coating that

unites with the scale already formed and lowers its melting point,

melting point of iron oxide or scale is higher than that required 
for welding. Wrought iron can be heated high enough to melt 
this oxide; most steels, except the very mild ones, will burn,

  however, before this tempera- 
ture is reached, making a flux 
a necessity in welding them. 
Materials Used for 
Fluxes.—Patent fluxes can be 
obtained from hardware stores 
for a few cents per pound, the 
chief ingredients being borax, 
sal ammoniac, and iron filings. 
For ordinary work with 
wrought iron and mild steel 
clean, white sand may be used 
successfully. The action of the 
sand is improved if mixed with 
borax, which has first been 
heated to drive off the water. 
For welding steel a flux 
made of 1 part sal ammoniac 
and 4 parts borax, treated as 
above, gives good results. The 
flux should be applied to the 
iron when it has reached a 
yellow heat. This temperature 
is necessary to cause it to stick. 
Drilling.—The drill should 
be kept sharp and well lubri- 
cated to prevent heating while 
in use. When grinding, the 
original shape (Fig. 172) 
should be preserved, giving 
some clearance back of the cut- 
ting edge. Squeaking and hard 
running indicate a lack of clearance or lubricant. Common machine 
oil makes a satisfactory lubricant for farm shop use. A center punch 
mark should be made (Fig. 173) in which to start the drill. The 
work should be held securely (Fig. 174), and the feed eased up as 
the drill comes through the metal, as otherwise the drill may be

ally and turn the die onto the rod (Fig. 175), using sufficient pres-

the vise and turning a tap of the proper size into them, running it 
clear through. The following table gives the size of drill necessary 
to use with the tap listed :

Riveting is done with hot or cold rivets, the former making the 
tighter joint. A rivet of a size to fill the hole should be used, and 
14  
-P-A-G-E-224
  210 FARM FORGE SHOP WORK 
one slightly longer than the thickness of the metal being riveted. 
The rivet is inserted in the hole, the head supported by a sledge or 
other heavy iron, and the other end swaged down with the pene of 
the hammer. It can be shaped with a rivet set in finishing to secure 
a smooth head. 
Working Steel.—Steel should be kept at a yellow heat while 
being worked. This heat should not be exceeded, and the steel should 
not be worked after it has cooled to a deep red. Too high a tempera- 
ture results in a coarse-grained steel, while working at too low a 
heat causes the formation of minute cracks along which the tool will 
break when in use. 
Hardening Steel.—When a piece of steel is heated to a dull red 
and then cooled suddenly by plunging into water or other cooling 
agent it becomes very hard and brittle. This is the common method 
used to give hand-made tools cutting qualities. The proper harden- 
ing heat varies. As a general rule it is lowered as the carbon content 
of the steel is increased. A cherry red heat, judged in the shade, is 
about right for the steel in common use. This will appear nearly 
black in the sunlight. A little experimenting and observation will 
determine the proper hardening heat for any steel. For example, an 
old cold chisel on which the top end is badly broken indicates a high 
carbon content, and points to a low heat as the proper one for hard- 
ening. One in which the top has mushroomed over would indicate 
a steel of lower carbon content. Too high a hardening heat makes 
the steel coarse-grained and brittle, destroying its usefulness. Steel 
should always be hardened by cooling it quickly, immediately it is 
taken from the fire. It should not be allowed to cool in the air 
before plunging it in water. 
Division Between Hardened and Soft Parts of Steel._— 
Usually a tool is composed of a hardened steel cutting edge and a 
softer part upon which the pounding is done as, for example, a cold 
chisel. Where this is the case the tool should be moved up and down 
in the water while hardening to avoid forming a sharp division 
between the hardened and unhardened parts, which is likely to cause 
breakage when the tool is put to use. Moving the tool about in the 
water also cools it more quickly and makes it harder. 
Tempering.—A piece of steel in this condition is too hard and 
brittle for ordinary use, and must have this extreme hardness 
 
-P-A-G-E-225
  CUTTING METAL WITH CHISELS 211 
removed to a certain extent, depending upon the use to which the 
tool is to be put. This is done by reheating and tempering. 
Reheating the Steel for Tempering.—The chief method used 
in farm practice to reheat the steel is to utilize heat remaining in 
the tool after hardening. The lower portion only is cooled in hard- 
ening and the heat remaining in the part above is then allowed to 
work down until the desired temperature is secured at the cutting 
edge, when the tool is again plunged in water and cooled. 
Determining Tempering Heat.—A piece of polished iron or 
steel will form a thin scale on the outside that changes in color as 
the heat is increased. At about 430 degrees F. this scale is a very 
pale ycllow. As the heat increases this changes through shades of 
yellow to brown, which becomes tinged with red, turning into light 
purple, dark purple, and finally blue. The following table taken 
from “Farm Blacksmithing,” by J. M. Drew, gives the colors indi- 
cating the tempering heat for various tools, and the approximate 
temperature corresponding to the color: 
Color Temperature, 
  F. degrees meet 
Very pale straw color 430 Stone drills for hard stone. 
Yellow 450 Woodworking tools, ordinary 
Dark yellow 470 } { stone drills. 
Brownish yellow 490 Hammer. 
Brown 500 Lathe tools. 
Brown tinged with purple 520 Drills (hard). 
Light purple 525 Drills (ordinary). 
Dark purple tinged with blue 550 Hard cold chisels. 
Dark blue 565 Cold chisels for soft iron, hand 
punches and hatchets. 
Light blue 605 Serew drivers. 
  
Annealing is the process of softening steel, and is accomplished 
by heating to the proper hardening heat and cooling very slowly by 
burying in ashes or some similar heat retainer. It results in a steel 
of extreme softness, strength and ductility. After forging, steel 
should always be annealed before hardening, as it relieves internal 
stresses in the metal and results in a better tool. 
Cutting Metal with Chisels.—Cutting should be done on the 
base of anvil horn (Fig. 176), or on the cutting block immediately
-P-A-G-E-226
  212 FARM FORGE SHOP WORK 
back of it. The face of the anvil is hardened and will injure the 
chisel if driven against it. The cold chisel should be held securely 
with the left hand and struck heavy blows. Place the chisel before 
each blow and nick clear around the iron to be cut off; then bring 
the nicked portion to the edge of the anvil and break off by a blow 
from the hammer as shown in figure 176. Keep the cold chisel 
sharpened with the edge slightly convex to give it strength. Avoid 
cutting with the corners of the chisel, to avoid breakage. When 
making deep cuts a handful of oil-soaked waste into which the 
chisel can be dipped occasionally will make it cut better. 
The hot chisel is used on hot metal in practically the same way 
that the cold chisel is used for cold metal. The metal to be cut 
  
          
“4 7

should be bright red. Dip the hot chisel frequently while using it to 
retain the temper. The hot chisel may be used in connection with 
the hardie in cutting hot metal, the hardie forming the lower blade 
of the shears. Avoid hitting the hardie with the hammer; the last 
blows struck should be overhanging blows. 
Cutting with the Hack-saw.—When using the hack-saw, draw 
the blade up taut in the frame, avoid twisting or cramping in the 
cut and use with little pressure to avoid breaking. For economy in 
the use of blades use the longest stroke possible, making every tooth 
in the saw do its full share of cutting (Fig. 177).

fitted with a handle permitting it to be grasped firmly. Hold the 
file steadily and use long strokes (Fig. 178). It should be lifted on 
the return stroke. It does no cutting on the return stroke and is 
dulled by contact with the metal. 
Care of Files——A satisfactory way of storing is to provide a 
shelf on which each file has a groove protecting it from dirt, grease, 
or injury. When a file becomes worn it may be kept for use on soft 
or dirty metals and a new file secured for the harder work.

5. Complete the fire by banking finely broken coal about it in the form 
of a hollow mound. Sprinkle this coal to dampen it and make it compact, 
causing it to form coke rapidly, confining the heat to the center and making 
the fire comfortable to work about.

not attempt to make a link too short as it cannot be handled in welding 
as easily as a longer one. 
3. Bend to a U-shape at this point, making the inside width of the U 
but slightly wider than the diameter of the rod from which it is made. 
4. Reheat to a bright red and cut off both legs of the U to an equal 
length on the hardie. When cutting material on the hardie finish the cut 
by shearing, overhanging blows to avoid striking and injuring the edge 
with the hammer.

at dark red heat and do not permit steel to become too hot. 
4. When worked to shape desired make a cut across both sides near 
the end with the hot chisel as shown. 
5. Heat cutting end of chisel back to point B slowly to a dull “cherry 
red” heat, the hardening heat of average steel, and bury it in the ashes in 
forge to cool slowly. This anneals it, making it soft and ductile, and re- 
lieves internal stresses, making the steel tougher and stronger. The anneal- 
ing may be omitted if desired. 
6. When annealing is completed reheat to cherry red or hardening 
heat to point B and plunge in water to point A. Swing the chisel to and 
fro and move up and down slightly to prevent sharp division between 
hardened and unhardened portions which might cause cracking. This 
treatment makes the lower portion very hard and brittle. 
7. Pull the chisel from the water and rap sharply on the anvil to 
break off the portion below the nick formed with the hot chisel. This 
leaves good steel for the cutting edge. The extreme end is likely to be 
injured by too high a heat. 
8. Polish the end of the chisel by rubbing on a brick, concrete floor or 
other means and watch for the band of color, caused by heating, work 
down from the uncooled section of the chisel between A and B. When the 
proper color has reached the edge, dark blue for a chisel for general use, 
plunge the tool in water again, cooling it. If the portion between A and B 
is still red, cool it slowly to prevent hardness and brittleness at this point. 
9. Grind edge to shape and angle shown in drawing.

      Water Systems.—Four general types of 
water systems are in use in farm practice: 
(1) Gravity, (2) hydropneumatic, (3) air 
pressure, (4) automatic. Hach of these sys- 
tems has features that adapt it to certain 
conditions. 
Gravity System.—This consists of an 
elevated source of supply from which water 
flows through pipes to the faucets by gravity. 
It is the cheapest system to install and can 
be adapted to widely varying conditions. It 
may range from a small tank in the attic, 
supplied by a force pump in the basement or 
well-house, and furnishing water for the 
kitchen sink (Fig. 203), to a concrete tank 
or reservoir on a nearby hill, supplied by a continuously, maintaining a supply of fresh, cold water for drinking and

serious, however, as long as the bottom is on the ground, protecting 
the pipes where they enter the tank. Earth can be graded up about 
the sides to furnish heat insulation. 
Elevation Required.—Where the distance from the supply 
tank to the point where the water is to be used does not exceed 100 
feet, a water level of from 10 to 15 feet above the highest faucet will 
give a satisfactory flow. As this distance is increased the elevation 
of the tank should be increased. 
The quantity of water used will vary greatly. The season, the 
weather, the facilities provided for using it, and the kind of work 
being done by the animals supplied are all influencing factors. 
Usually the quantity used increases after the installation of a sys- 
tem. The following are fair average daily requirements :

Determining the Size of Tank Required—The necessary 
capacity in gallons can be determined for any given place from the 
table. For example, a tank supplying water to a family of six 
people and to twenty-five head of cattle should have a capacity of at 
least 450 gallons or 60 cubic feet. One cubic foot is equal to 744 
gallons. Where a windmill is used for power this capacity should 
be multiplied by three to insure sufficient water to carry over 
calm periods.

Hydropneumatic System.—In this system the water is pumped 
into an airtight steel tank. As the water is pumped in, the air is 
compressed above it, and the resulting pressure is used to force 
water from the faucets when they are opened. This system is 
adapted to general farm use where the quantity of water required 
is not too great. Where large quantities of water are needed it is 
expensive to install because of the large tank necessary. The tank 
is usually placed in the basement, insuring cool water in the sum- 
mer and_ protecting 
against freezing in the 
winter. A hydropneu- 
matic outfit is shown 
in figure 205.

an air compressor is 
used and compressed 
air only is stored. This

submerged pump. The pump is automatic, starting when the pres- 
sure is released by the opening of a faucet and stopping when the 
faucet is closed. It pumps water directly from the well, insuring 
cool water if it is permitted to run long enough to empty the pipe. 
This system is adapted to use where it is desired to have both 
cistern and well water on tap, as the same power plant can operate 
both pumps. ' It is also adapted to use where it is desirable to have 
the power plant at some distance from the well or other source of 
supply. Figure 206 shows an air pressure system. 
Automatic System.—This system (Fig. 207) consists of an 
electrically-driven pump controlled by a pressure-operated switch. 
When the pressure is released by the opening of a faucet the pump 
starts and continues to operate until the pressure is again restored 
after the faucet is closed. Being electrically driven it is restricted 
to localities where electric power is available. This may be obtained 
either from a commercial line or from a home lighting plant. Where 
battery current from a home lighting plant is used for power an 
installation of this kind is not advised for stock watering because of 
the cost of operation, The system is well adapted to household use,

The Farm Pump.—Practically all of the pumps used in farm 
practices are of the reciprocating type, and can be divided roughly 
into two classes: (1) Lift pumps, (2) force pumps. 
A simple lift pump is shown in figure 208. Water is raised by 
a plunger working within the cylinder. With this type of pump 
water can be lifted only to the spout as the top of the pump is left 
open. It is adapted to such purposes as watering stock where the 
water is raised from a comparatively shallow well and discharged

Fra. 209.—Simple single-acting force pump. This pump differs from the lift pump in that the rod, passes through a gland and stuffing nut at the top of the air-chamber, 
making a water-tight joint which permits using the pump to force water to an elevated tank or 
against pressure. The pump is also provided with an air-chamber, which tends to relieve shocks and strains on the pump and equalizes 
the flow to some extent.

upper cylinder acts as stuff-

causes water to be dis- 
charged on both up and 
down strokes of the pump, 
securing an even flow and 
making the pump easy to operate. (Red Jacket Manufacturing Co.)

The force pump shown in figure 209 is similar to the lift pump, 
but has a closed top, which 
permits the water to be 
pumped against pressure. It 
is also provided with an air 
chamber which serves to 
equalize the flow somewhat 
and to relieve shocks caused 
by the sudden starting of the 
water column when the 
plunger is raised. A differen- 
tial cylinder is sometimes 
used to further equalize the, 
flow of water. This is shown 
in figures 210 and 211. Force 
pumps, being designed for 
higher lifts, are usually built 
stronger than lift pumps and 
equipped with smaller cyl- 
inders, particularly where 
they are to be hand operated. 
Both force and lift pumps can 
be obtained with windmill 
or power tops which permit 
their operation by gasoline 
engine or other power. 
Properties of Air—Air 
is compressible, elastic, and 
has weight. When pressure is 
brought to bear upon it, it 
can be crowded into a smaller 
space, immediately expanding 
again when the pressure is 
released. This property is 
utilized in the air chamber 
of force pumps as well as in

and B. At A the plunger is shown at the lower end of the cylinder. 
As it starts upward the air beneath expands, filling the increasing 
space. As the air expands the pressure is lessened and it soon drops 
so low that the pressure of the atmosphere on the water of the well 
(14.7 pounds) is sufficient to force a column of water up the suction 
pipe and push open the valve at the bottom of the cylinder. The 
water flows into the cylinder until the weight of the water in the 
suction pipe plus the remaining air pressure in the cylinder is equal 
to the outside atmospheric pressure. 
In B the plunger is starting on its return trip. The valve in the 
bottom of the cylinder closes, trapping the water in the cylinder. 
Water being practically incompressible, cannot be squeezed into a 
smaller space as air would, and consequently the valve in the plunger 
is forced open and the water escapes through it as the plunger con- 
tinues to move downward. When the plunger reaches the bottom 
of its stroke the process is repeated. As the plunger again starts 
upward the valve closes and the water above is carried toward the 
spout while the cylinder is again filled by the pressure of 
the atmosphere. 
Atmospheric Pressure and Suction—The effect of atmos- 
pheric pressure due to the weight of air, i.¢., the filling of the pump 
cylinder when the plunger is pulled upward, is frequently spoken 
of as “ suction ” and the pipe leading from the water to the cylinder 
is commonly called the “ suction ” pipe. The fact that it is pressure, 
caused by the weight of air, that is lifting the water can be very 
easily proved by simple experiments. 
Experiment 1.—Fill a bottle with clean water. Insert a short glass 
tube through a hole in a loosely fitting cork and apply the mouth to the 
end of the tube and suck. Water will flow up the tube and into the mouth. 
Now tightly seal the cork in the bottle with sealing wax or parafline 
and again attempt to get water by sucking. This time no water will be 
obtained. Air must be free to press upon the surface of the water and 
force it up the tube when the pressure above is reduced by sucking. 
Experiment 2.—Place about an inch of water in a square syrup can 
and bring it to a boil. Let it boil briskly for a few minutes to fill the 
can with steam and drive out the air. Remove the can from the fire, screw 
the cover on quickly and tightly and dash cold water over the can to 
condense the steam contained. As the steam is condensed a vacuum will 
be drawn inside the can and the weight of the air outside will crush it.

with an ordinary pump, and there must also be ‘sufficient difference 
in pressure to cause a flow of water to the cylinder. Because of 
these factors a pump cylinder cannot be placed more than twenty 
to twenty-five feet above the water surface. In mountainous regions 
this should be reduced 
to 15 feet. In all cases

level, a lift pump fitted with a large diameter cylinder can be used. 
If the lift is high and the water has to be forced to an elevated tank 
or against pressure, a force pump with a smaller cylinder should be 
purchased. For hand use the “ double-acting” pump is the best. 
This, through the action of a differential cylinder, discharges half 
of its water on the down stroke of the plunger, making the 
flow more nearly constant and the operation of the pump easier.

Types of Cylinders.—Cylinders are obtainable in brass, called 
brass body, in brass-lined, and in plain cast iron. Of these the brass- 
lined cylinder is the best (Fig. 214). The cast iron shell gives it 
the strength of the cast iron cylinder, while the brass lining gives 
it the smoothness of the brass body cylinder. 
Pump troubles can be diagnosed quite closely from the action

  OPERATION OF THE RAM 
of the water passing through it, the exact 
quantity depending upon the length of the 
discharge pipe, the height to which the 
water is raised and other factors. It is use- 
ful for pumping water from a spring or 
stream situated below the buildings where 
the following conditions exist: 
1. The spring must furnish a minimum flow 
of three gallons per minute. 
2. There must be a minimum fall of three 
feet, i.e., the ram must be at least three feet 
below the water level in the spring. 
3. There must be good drainage below the 
ram permitting the free discharge of waste 
water and preventing flooding during periods of 
high water. 
The ram may be used to supply either 
an elevated tank or a pressure tank. A small 
tank in the house attic (Fig. 204) is the 
most common installation; the ram is per- 
mitted to work continuously and the over- 
flow led to the barn. This insures a constant 
supply of fresh, cold water at the house. 
Where conditions are right for installing 
a ram a manufacturer should be consulted 
and the ram ordered and placed under his 
instruction. This fixes responsibility for 
results. 
Operation of the Ram.—In figure 215, 
G is the drive pipe, down which water flows 
from the spring to the base of the ram, B, 
and escapes through the impetus valve, F. 
When sufficient velocity is attained the 
impetus valve is closed suddenly, stopping 
the flow of water in the drive pipe and 
causing it to exert a hammer-like blow upon 
the water contained in the base of the ram.

the water is forced into the air bell, A, compressing the air above it. 
Compressed air is elastic. Consequently there is a rebound which 
closes the check valve, E, and causes a slight backward surge in the 
drive pipe, reducing the pressure in the base. This causes a small 
quantity of air to enter through the snifting valve, ©, and the 
impetus valve to again drop open. Water now starts flowing down 
the drive pipe, G, and the process is repeated as long as the ram 
continues to run. Water entering the air bell, A, is forced up the

valve maintains the supply in the bell, which would otherwise be 
absorbed by the water. 
The ram may be used in connection with springs, streams, or 
flowing wells. Where a small spring occurs in connection with a 
stream unfit for drinking a double-acting ram may be installed.
-P-A-G-E-261
  PIPE FITTING 247 
This uses the water of the stream as motive power and pumps the 
spring water to the buildings. 
Pipe Fitting.—A set of pipe tools consisting of 44-inch, 34-inch, 
1, and 1%-inch dies, a 
pipe vise, pipe cutter, 
reamer and two 18-inch 
Stillson wrenches will be 
found sufficient for most 
jobs, as most of the work 
wilk consist of cutting, 
threading and _ putting 
pipe together. Pipe is 
joined by means of 
threaded sleeves called 
couplings. Elbows of 45 
degrees or 90 degrees are 
used for making changes 
in direction. Where a 
pipe is connected between 
two other pipes or where 
it may be desirable to dis- 
connect it without dis- 
turbing the remainder of 
the line, a union is used. 
A bushing or reducer is 
used where it is desired 
to make a change in size. 
Common pipe fittings are 
shown in figure 216. Pipe 
is fitted with a tapered 
thread, and a pipe cement 
or lubricant is used when 
assembling to permit ii 
to be screwed tightly to- 
gether. It also tends to 
prevent rusting in the 
joint, making the pipe 
easy to take apart later if . Fic. 216.—Common pipe fittings used in the

threaded ends of the pipe only. When applied inside the couplings 
it is likely to obstruct the pipe after hardening. White lead paste 
is often used as a lubricant and cement in assembling pipe. The 
addition of graphite improves it. 
Size of Pipe to Use.—In farm water installations the factors 
or causes acting to create a flow of water in the pipes are: (1) Pres- 
sure due to pumping, (2) the pull of gravity. 
In gravity systems the vertical distance of the source above the 
point of discharge is called the “head.” These two factors, head 
and pressure, are interchangeable; pressure of one pound per 
square inch corresponding to a head of 2.3 feet, while a head of one 
foot is equal to a pressure of .434 pounds per square inch. 
There are many factors which act to retard the flow of water in 
a pipe. 
1. Friction is proportional to the length of the pipe. 
2. Friction increases approximately as the square of the velocity. 
3. Friction varies inversely as the diameter of the pipe; a 14’ pipe 
offering twice the resistance of a pipe 1’ in diameter. 
4. Friction is increased by roughness, bends, elbows and valves. 
From the above it is evident that under conditions of long lines, 
low heads, or where a large supply of water is desired, a large pipe 
should be used. %4” and 1” pipes are standard sizes for farm use.

Soldering.—The use of threaded fittings makes it possible to 
do almost any job of farm plumbing by the use of pipe tools alone. 
However, the occasional use of lead pipe and the necessary repairs 
to metal roofs and tinware makes a knowledge of solder- 
ing desirable. 
Tools and Equipment Required.—The soldering copper is 
the most essential tool. With it, solder, and a flux, simple repair
-P-A-G-E-263
  HEATING THE SOLDERING IRON 249 
work can be done. A heavy copper should be purchased for farm 
work, as it retains the heat longer. It is also advisable to purchase 
them in pairs, so that one may be heating while the other is being 
used. The shape shown in figure 217 is most desirable for general 
use. The following tools are desirable: 
Gasoline fire pot. Y%" cold chisel. 
Snips. Small punch or nail set. 
Rivet set. 
Essentials of Soldering—To secure satisfactory work in 
soldering the following essentials must be secured: 
/     
Fic. 217.—Equipment for soldering: 1, gasoline fire-pot tor heating soldering copper; 
2, snips for cutting sheet metal; 3, cold ‘chisel; 4, punch; 5, rivet set; 6, soldering copper; 7, sal ammoniac; 8, solder; 9, soldering flux;'10, knife for scraping metal bright; 11, riveting hammer. 
1. The soldering copper must be kept hot, clean and have the point 
well tinned. 
2. The metals to be soldered must be scraped thoroughly, securing clean, 
bright surfaces for uniting. 
3. A good flux must be used to keep the metals in this condition and 
to aid in the flow of the solder. 
4, The metals that are being united must be heated above the melting 
point of the solder used. 
Heating the Soldering Iron.—The soldering iron should be 
placed in the pot so that the flame plays against its base. This 
protects the tinning on the point of the iron from the flame, keeping 
it clean and in good condition. Where the soldering iron must be 
heated in a coal stove it can be protected by using a short length of 
114-inch pipe, 6 to 8 inches long, and heating the iron within it. 
 
-P-A-G-E-264
250 THE FARM WATER SUPPLY 
| Keeping the Iron in Condition.—One of the best arrangements 
| for maintaining the tinning on the iron is the brick soldering “ jig ” 
shown in figure 218. Small pieces of rosin and sal ammoniac are 
placed in the cavity cut in the brick, and the heated iron cleaned, 
fluxed and tinned as it is rubbed on the brick in contact with 
solder. A few rubs before replacing the iron in the pot for reheat- 
ing will keep it in excellent working shape. Should the iron be

applied to the surfaces after scraping. The following materials are 
used as fluxes: 
Chloride of zine (liquid). Tallow. 
Commercial flux (paste). Hydrochloric acid. 
Rosin (paste, powder or liquid). 
Chloride of zinc is the most generally used flux in rough repair 
work. It is prepared from hydrochloric acid and zine, as directed in 
Job 6. It is satisfactory for use on tin, galvanized iron, copper and 
general work. When used on galvanized iron, hydrochloric acid is 
sometimes added. This acts on the galvanizing and should be 
washed off when the work is completed to prevent further action. 
Rosin is used in soldering tin, copper, galvanized iron and lead. 
It is prepared for use by pulverizing and applying as a powder, by 
mixing to a paste with tallow or by forming a thin varnish by dis- 
solving in alcohol. 
Commercial fluxes are largely made in the form of pastes

required the pipe must be cut and threaded for joining up in the 
length desired. 
Method of Work.—1. Determine and mark point at which it is desired 
to cut pipe. 
2. Place in pipe vise with marked point about 6” from vise. 
3. Adjust cutter to pipe, turn down tightly, apply lard oil and move 
handle sufficiently to make a mark clear around the pipe. With 3-wheel 
type of cutter a half revolution is sufficient. (Fig. 219.) 
4, Tighten one-fourth turn and repeat. Repeat this process until pipe 
is cut off. Use plenty of oil. 
5, Insert pipe die of the size described in stock. See that guide bush- 
ing in stock corresponds to size of pipe being threaded. 
6. With file remove burr from end of pipe so that guide bushing will slip 
over it easily. 
7. Apply lard oil to dies and pushing guide over the end of the pipe 
turn stock to the right at the same time using considerable pressure. (Fig.

themselves on. Strive to engage dies at once. Otherwise a rounded pipe 
end results which is hard to join.

Job 4.—Installing a Farm Pump.—Practically all farm water 
supplies are obtained from wells, cisterns, or springs whose level 
is below that of the point at which the water is used, making the 
use of a pump necessary. 
Method of Work.—1. Examine situation and determine type of pump 
required. 
2. Determine proper size of cylinder to use by reference to page 243. 
3. Measure depth of well and determine length of pipe and pump rod 
required. Pipe should reach nearly but not quite to well bottom. Cylin-

der must be placed within 25 feet of permanent water level and the nearer 
it can be placed the better. Best results are secured when lower cylinder 
is submerged. Suflicient pump rod must be purchased to reach from top 
of pump to bottom of cylinder. 
4, Purchase pump and piping. 
5. Examine valves and see that they seat properly. Remove any metal 
chips or other obstruction that might hold them from seat. 
6. Soak valves and plunger leathers in luke warm water until soft. 
7. Assemble pump. Use pipe cement on joints and draw up tightly 
to prevent air leaks below cylinder. If well is shallow, pump may be 
assembled complete on surface and then lowered into well. In this case 
secure all measurements for pipe lengths and begin assembling at pump 
and work downward. With deep well lower a length of pipe into the well 
and hold by means of chains, clamps or wrenches while the length above 
is screwed into place. Cut and thread pump rod so that the joints come 
a little above the pipe joints when the plunger is at the bottom of cylinder. 
This permits installation or removal of pump in sections,

this point when pumping ceases. 
9. Fasten base of pump to water-tight platform, concrete preferred. 
(Fig. 223.) 
10. Arrange means to carry waste water away from well, preventing 
surface wash from getting back into well.

greater than 40 strokes per minute and adjust stroke to as long as can 
be used without plunger hitting at top or bottom of cylinder. Test pump

by hand before applying power to avoid possible breakage. A slow speed 
with long stroke is best for power work. 
Job 5.—Repairing the Farm Pump. Putting in a New 
Plunger Leather.—The pump will eventually fail through wear. 
The ability to locate the trouble and remedy it is an advantage to 
the farmer living at a considerable distance from the plumber. 
Method of Work.—1. Determine probable source of trouble by noting 
action of pump. In this case a worn plunger leather or defective plunger 
valve is assumed. 
2. Provide materials indicated as being necessary to make repair. 
3. Take pump from well. Pump may be lifted by means of two levers 
and chains as shown in figure 224. Two chains are used giving each a slip 
hitch about the pipe. One lever supports the pump while the other is raised 
to secure a new grip. This process is repeated until a joint appears at the 
surface when it is taken apart. Continue until the cylinder is reached. 
If well is shallow entire pump can be raised and taken apart on the surface.

4, When cylinder is reached support pipe beneath cylinder to prevent 
pipe slipping into well and remove upper cylinder head. Take out plunger. 
5. Fasten upper part of plunger in vise and remove lower part by 
turning. Lower part is usually slotted making it possible to fit and use a 
piece of flat iron like a large screw driver if special tool is not available. It 
may also be turned by means of a punch or dull cold chisel and hammer. 
If it resists turning tap lightly around circumference to loosen thread. If 
this fails apply heat and soak in kerosene. 
6. Clean metal faces of plunger by scraping and fit new leather which 
has been previously soaked. 
7. Assemble plunger using grease and graphite on thread to prevent 
rust and permit easy removal in the future. 
8. Examine pump for other possible defects before reassembling, making 
repairs where needed. 
9. Reassemble pump, beginning at the cylinder and working upward, 
lowering pump into well as the work progresses. 
10. Fasten to platform and test. 
Job 6.—Making a Zinc Chloride Flux.—aA flux is used in 
soldering to lessen the oxidation of the metals and to aid in securing 
a flow of solder into the joint. A zine chloride flux is easily pre- 
pared, and is well adapted to general repair work. 
Method of Work.—1. Secure at the hardware store a pint of com- 
mercial hydrochloric acid and place in a quart glass fruit jar. 
2. Secure a quantity of scrap zinc, cut it into small pieces with the 
snips and add slowly to the acid. Add suflicient zine to neutralize the acid. 
This condition can be told by pieces left undissolved in the bottom of the 
jar after the bubbling action has ceased. Zine taken from discarded dry 
cells, if scraped clean, makes a good flux because of its purity. 
3. When action has ceased pour off the clear liquid and add an equal 
quantity of clean soft water. 
4, Place a lump of sal ammoniac in a strong cloth and pound to a 
powder with a hammer, Add two teaspoonfuls of this sal ammoniac powder 
to the quart of liquid. Keep this as a stock solution in the glass jar, pour- 
ing out a small quantity in a jelly tumbler for use. Discard and obtain 
a fresh supply when it becomes dirty. 
Do not store this flux near tools as the fumes from it cause them 
to rust. 
Job %—Tinning the Soldering Iron.—To have the molten 
solder flow freely from the point of the iron it must be coated with 
a film of solder. The process of applying this solder is called 
“tinning ” the iron, and a soldering copper so treated is said to 
be “ tinned.” 
Method of Work.—1. Clean the iron with a flat file, making the 
four sides of the point clean and bright. 
2. Heat in fire pot or by other means until copper will melt solder 
freely upon touching it. Do not heat hotter than required to do this. 
3. Take from fire and if dirty wipe on damp rag or waste. 
4. Plunge point into glass of soldering flux as prepared in Job 6,
-P-A-G-E-271
  SOLDERING LEAKY BUCKETS 257 
This cleans point and makes it bright. Other fluxes may be used for 
the purpose as well. 
5. Rub the point of the cleaned and heated iron in solder. (Fig. 225). 
The melted solder should flow over the entire point covering it with a 
bright coating of tin like silver. The iron must be kept in this condition 
to do satisfactory work. The use of the “jig” (Fig. 218), will keep the 
point bright and clean unless the tinning is burned off by overheating. 
Job 8.—Soldering Leaky Buckets.—Buckets frequently

opened by water freezing in them. In most cases repairs can be 
quickly made by soldering. 
Method of Work.—l. Scrape surface to be soldered absolutely clean 
and bright. The success of the soldering depends largely upon the thor- 
oughness with which the material is scraped. Scrape with an old pocket 
knife or mowing machine section. 
2. With wooden mallet and block return bucket to as near original 
shape as possible, bringing the surfaces together that are to be soldered. 
3, Apply flux to the surfaces to be united. Flux can be applied by 
means of a small stick with the end pounded forming a small stiff brush. 
4. Heat soldering copper, placing in fire so that flame does not play on 
point. Copper is to be previously tinned as directed in Job 7. As experi- 
ence is gained copper can be placed in pot to heat while work is being pre- 
pared for soldering. 
5. When copper has heated sufficiently to melt solder quickly remove 
from fire pot and wiping quickly on damp rag or waste, plunge point into 
flux. 
6. Pick up solder with heated iron (Fig. 226) and apply to place to 
be soldered. Move soldering iron slowly enough to permit material to be 
heated above the melting point of solder, about 370 degrees F. Heavy

material requires a hotter iron and slower movement than light metal. 
Hold surfaces being soldered in close contact until solder solidifies. Tilt 
bucket so that melted solder will flow along seam to the point desired. If 
the heat is right, the surface clean and properly fluxed, and the iron is 
clean and well tinned, solder will flow along it as ink after a pen. 
When solder begins to build up under the iron and appear rough and dull 
in color it indicates that the iron is getting too cold and it should be reheated. 
Solder flows freely from a hot iron and hardens smoothly. An overheated 
iron is indicated by the tinning on the point changing to a bronze color. 
When overheated it must be retinned. Where more solder is required, as 
in filling a seam, than can be picked up by the iron (Fig. 226), hold the 
solder above the iron and melt off the quantity desired. 
7. Again scrape and apply flux to any places to which solder fails to 
adhere. Excess solder can be removed by a sharp rap while still in mol- 
ten state. 
8. Smooth up work and test with hot water for leaks. 
Job 9—Replacing a Broken Ear on a Galvanized Iron 
Pail—Pails, otherwise good, are frequently discarded because of a 
broken ear. When a pail fails from this cause the rivets holding 
the ear usually pull out due to the metal of the pail rusting 
about them. 
Method of Work.—1. Cut from light galvanized iron, with the snips, 
a piece about 3’ square. Cut off lower corners about 4” and bend to fit 
curvature of pail. 
2. Fit patch centrally over place where ear has been removed and 
with upper edge pushed well up under rim of pail. 
3. While held in this position punch holes with nail set or small 
punch in each corner of patch supporting the inside of the pail on the end 
of a block of hard wood while so doing. (Fig. 227.) 
4, Light pot and heat soldering iron. 
5. Remove patch, and with old pocket knife or discarded mower sec- 
tion, thoroughly clean both the edges of the patch and the portion of the 
pail met by it. Scrape until absolutely clean and bright. 
6. Put patch in position and rivet in place with small tinned or copper 
rivets. Support the inside of the pail on the horn of the anvil while doing 
this, and finish rivet heads smooth with rivet set. 
7. Serape the ear of the pail clean; clean the portion of the patch upon 
which it is to be placed; punch the holes and rivet in position. 
8. Clean the portion of the patch appearing through the hole in the 
pail, and the surface of the pail around the holes where the old rivets rusted 
out. Scrape out all rust down to a bright surface. 
9, Apply zine chloride flux to the cleaned surfaces, using a little extra 
hydrochloric acid if obtainable. 
10. Remove hot copper from fire pot, dip point in flux and apply solder 
as when making repair to tin bucket. Use copper very hot and work back 
and forth in melted solder until work is thoroughly heated. 
11. Wipe melted solder quickly with waste. This removes some of the 
galvanizing permitting the next solder that is applied to get down to the 
metal beneath the galvanizing. Solder applied to the surface of galvanizing 
with a moderately hot iron does not make a permanent repair. Sufficient 
heat must be used to remove some of it and let the solder get down to the 
metal beneath.

12. Again apply flux and solder as before. Tilt work so that solder 
flows into seams. Use plenty of flux and heat the material thoroughly. 
The result should be a smooth, tight job. (Fig. 228.) 
Job 10.—Joining Lead Pipe.—Lead pipe is sometimes used 
in plumbing where bends make it difficult to use galvanized iron 
fittings. The joint described is easily made and is tight. 
Method of Work.—1. By means of turning pin spread end of lead 
pipe that points upward or into which water flows, to a bell shape. If no 
turning pin is at hand one can be made by sharpening a hard wood stick 
to a blunt point like a top. Pound lightly into end of pipe at the same 
time turning it around. (Fig. 229.) 
2. With a knife shave the inside portion of the bell-shaped end so 
formed until bright and immediately smear with tallow to prevent oxidation. 
3. With the rasp taper the end of the other pipe to fit into the bell 
just formed. Shave this end bright and coat with tallow. 
4. Heat the soldering copper and prepare for soldering by dipping 
point in flux as in Jobs 8 and 9. 
5. Insert. spigot end in bell end and melt in solder with the hot iron. 
Hold work in upright position while doing this. Heat solder until thor- 
oughly liquified but be careful not to melt piping as melting point of lead 
is not much above that of solder. Rosin can be used as a flux in con- 
nection with tallow.

CARE AND REPAIR OF HARNESS 
To Be kept in condition, harness must be cleaned and oiled 
periodically and repaired when necessary. A few stitches taken at 
the beginning of a rip will frequently save expensive repairs.

method, making a stronger, neater and more flexible union. Riveting 
is quicker, being more in the nature of a temporary repair. Except 
in places where metal is being joined to leather or other exceptional 
cases, stitching should be used. 
Tools and Equipment Required.—Repair work can be done 
with a pocket-knife, kneedles, awl, thread, and wax, but a few 
simple tools help very much in making a satisfactory repair. These 
are shown in figure 230.

A good quality of harness leather should be used in making 
repairs. Straps cut from spongy flank and belly pieces of the hide 
are worthless. Harness leather can be purchased by the pound or 
side, and should be secured from a reputable dealer who can guaran- 
tee the quality. 
 
-P-A-G-E-277
WASHING AND OILING HARNESS 263 
The thread used in stitching leather is made from flax fiber. 
The size known as No. 10 is in general use for the purpose. It is 
unwound from the inside, and is best kept in a tin or card- 
board box with the end projecting through a hole in the cover to 
prevent tangling. 
Black wax used for coating the thread is obtainable in two 
grades; summer and winter. The winter wax is softer than the 
summer grade, and can be used in a colder 
temperature. Both must be used where it is 
warm, or they will chip from the thread. 
Harness needles differ from ordinary 
sewing needles in that they are coarser 
and have round points. The size known 
as number 5 is suitable. 
The finishing wheel is used for 
smoothing out the stitching, and making 
it appear uniform after completion. It can 
also be used to mark the position of the 
stitches before sewing is begun. A size 
marking six stitches to the inch is good 
for general use. 
Waxed End.—The thread used in har- 
ness repairing consists of a number of linen 
threads twisted together, forming a cord 
about 5 feet in length with tapered ends. 
The wax protects it from moisture, makes 
a very strong and durable thread, and holds yy. 933.—stitching clamp 
it from pulling out of the stitching. The made from two oak barrel ; : staves held together by means number of threads used in making a waxed of horseshoe or ring pushed

Stitching Clamp.—A stitching horse is the best arrangement 
for holding the work while stitching, but a clamp made from two 
oak barrel staves can be used (Fig. 233). 
Washing and Oiling Harness.—For washing, warm soft water 
should be used in connection.with some pure soap such as castile. 
To dislodge hardened grease a fairly stiff brush may be used or it 
may be scraped off with a dull knife, taking care not to injure the 
stitching. For oiling heavy harness, U. 8. Farmers’ Bulletin 1183 
recommends either a mixture of tallow and cod oil or tallow and mm, 
ater

neat’s foot oil, or a mixture of all can be used. The use of a 
grease containing mineral acids or oxalic acid is detrimental. 
Job 1.—Making a Six-thread Waxed End.—A waxed thread 
is used for making repairs to harness. It resists pulling from the 
awl holes and is waterproof, due to its waxed coating. 
Method of Work.—1. Pull from the center of a ball of linen shoe 
thread a piece about five feet in length. A longer thread cannot be handled 
conveniently in stitching. 
2. Hold the thread between the thumb and finger of the left hand and 
roll down the right leg under the palm of the right hand until the twist

is removed from the fibers composing the thread and they lie straight. 
(Fig. 234.) 
3. Separate the thread at this point by grasping between the thumbs 
and fingers on each side of the untwisted portion and twitching lightly. 
Be careful to secure a long tapering break. 
4. Prepare five other threads in the same manner laying them separately 
on the bench top as they are separated from the ball. 
5. Lay the threads side by side with the ends uneven. This will give 
a long tapering end when they are twisted and waxed. 
6. Place some shoemaker’s wax on a piece of leather and warm it 
slightly. 
7. Loop the assembled threads over a hook or nail and holding them 
about 6” from the end with the left hand, wax the ends as shown in 
figure 235.

Job 2.—Splicing a Strap.—Straps can be repaired by stitching 
or riveting or by use of a Conway loop. Stitching makes the 
best repair. 
Method of Work.—1. Bevel off straps on flesh side for a distance 
of from 2-%”" to 3”. Cut ends off square. Beveling or “skiving ” can be 
done with the round knife or sharp plane. (Fig. 239.) It is done on flesh 
side of leather because the strap is weakened less by keeping the hair 
side intact. 
2. Lay the straps on a board with the hair sides up, lapping them 
somewhat more than the amount of beveling. Lay a rule or short straight 
edge along one side and fasten splice temporarily by means of small nail 
at each end. 
3. Using the finger as a guide run the finishing wheel or pricking 
wheel along each side of the splice marking the location of the awl 
holes. Awl holes can be located with a rule if wheel is not available.

CHAPTER XVIII 
ROPE AND ITS USE ON THE FARM 
Tue American farmer is a heavy user of rope and cordage, 
making a knowledge of the selection, use and care of rope together 
with skill in making splices and certain knots and hitches of value 
to him. 
Materials from Which Rope is Made.—Rope is made from a 
variety of vegetable fibers as manila, sisal, cotton, jute and coir. 
Practically all of the 
rope and _ cordage 
used in farm prac- 
tice is made from 
either manila’ or 
sisal fiber or a com- 
bination of the two. 
Manila fiber is 
taken from the outer 
layers of the Abaca 
plant, which closely 
resembles that of 
the banana. The 
world’s supply 
comes from the 
Philippine Islands, 
and is shipped from 
Fia. cea Te aed pe xing strands (2); yarns the port of Manila, 
hence the name. 
Sisal Fiber—The sisal plant is called by the natives “hene- 
quen,” and is grown in huge plantations in Yucatan. The leaves 
are harvested and the fiber removed by modern methods. The fiber 
secured is inferior to the better grades of manila, being heavier, 
stiffer, coarser, and weaker. 
Manufacture of Rope.—The fiber is oiled, straightened, and 
spun with a right-hand twist, into yarn. A number of yarns are 
then put together and twisted to the left, forming a strand. Three 
or four of these strands are then twisted together to the right to 
form a rope (Fig. 246). This twisting, although necessary to join 
the fibers, which average only about six feet in length, greatly 
272 
 
-P-A-G-E-287
  THREE-STRAND ROPE 273, 
reduces the strength. Excessive twist weakens a rope, increases the 
weight per foot, makes the rope stiff and rigid, subject to kinking, 
internal chafing and wear, and hard to splice and tie. 
For general farm use rope is available in three different styles, 
3-strand, 4-strand, and 
hawser-laid (Fig. 247). 
Selection of Rope.— 
The choice of a rope 
depends largely upon the 
service to which it is to 
be put. Where it is used 
over pulleys of proper 
size there is little out- 
side wear, the greater 
wear coming on the in- 
terior, due to chafing as 
the rope bends. Such a 
condition is found in 
horse fork service, and 
a medium lay manila 
rope should be used for 
this purpose. Sizes 34- 
inch and Y%-inch are in 
common use. For well 
drilling, land-clearing, 
ete., a hawser-laid cable 
should be used. This, 
because of its hard exte- 
rior, resists outside wear 
well, and will give the 
best service under these 
conditions. Halter ties 
should be made of a very

soft lay rope because of its flexibility, softness, and freedom from 
kinking. Cotton rope is much used for cattle halters. 
Three-strand rope is in most general use, and is lighter and 
stronger than corresponding grades and sizes in 4-strand, but does 
not run so freely through pulleys, being more subject to kinking. It 
is obtainable in soft, medium or hard twist or “lay.” For general 
use the medium lay should be chosen. 
18 
 
-P-A-G-E-288
  274 ROPE AND ITS USE ON THE FARM 
Four-strand rope is made with or without a heart. The rope 
containing a heart is usually made with a firmer lay than the “ no- 
heart ” rope, which is laid up soft. Four-strand rope is round in 
cross-section (Fig. 247), and runs through pulleys freely. For 
these reasons it is sometimes used in horse fork work, although its 
greater cost usually prevents such use. It runs 6 per cent heavier, 
and sells for one cent more per pound than ordinary three- 
strand rope. 
Hawser-laid rope is used for well-drilling and similar work, 
where there is great outside wear. It is made from three small ropes 
twisted to the left to form one large one, and presents a hard 
exterior, which resists outside wear. 
Strength of Rope.—Manila fiber has great strength, Reet oe a 
pull of about 30,000 pounds per square aren of cross-section before 
breaking. Various formulas are in use for computing the breaking 
strength of new manila rope. The Whitlock Cordage Company 
gives the following formula: Dx D X 7500 equals breaking 
strength in pounds. D equals diameter of rope in inches. 
Example: What is the breaking strength of a new manila rope 1” 
in diameter? 
Solution: 1X1 X 7500 equals 7500, pounds breaking strength. 
Sisal rope has only about three-fourths the strength of manila.

Rope is sold by the pound, but is used by the foot. Cheap rope 
is usually made of an inferior fiber or loaded during the process of 
making so that it is either weaker and shorter lived or it is heavier

is one of the most common adulterants. Its presence makes a rope 
rough and unpleasant to handle. Rope should be kept dry, as water

Inspection.—The outside appearance of a rope used with pul- 
leys is little indication of its true condition, as the wear is largely 
inside. To inspect the rope, grasp it firmly in both hands and 
untwist it (Fig. 248). If it shows considerable wear on the inside 
the load should be lessened, and if there is considerable powder and

  276 ROPE AND ITS USE ON THE FARM 
short pieces of broken fiber the rope should be discarded or put 
to use where its failure will do no damage. Such a rope is likely 
to break under q very light load. 
Block and Tackle.—One or more grooved wheels mounted 
within a suitable frame is called a block. Two of these blocks with 
a rope properly attached and threaded through them constitute 
a tackle. The different parts of a set of tackle and their names are 
shown in figure 249. The sheaves should be kept well oiled to 
lessen friction. 
Lifting Force of Tackle—-The advantage secured by the use of 
tackle depends upon the number of parts of rope supporting the 
load, and the way in which the pulleys are attached. The common 
rule for determining the mechanical advantage secured follows: 
Multiply the pull in pounds by the number of ropes supporting the 
load. This gives the theoretical weight that can be supported. 
Due to friction in the rope and blocks, it is never possible to lift 
as much as computed by the theoretical rule given. The following 
table, originally arranged by J. B. Frear, from the American Civil 
Engineers Pocket Book, gives the ratio existing between weight 
lifted and pull on fall rope, with the number of sheaves and size 
rope indicated :   
  
  Number of Sheaves Diameter of Rope in Inches ae Movable (1 KO ve yr Le 
1 1 1.93 1.92 1.93 1,92 1.91 
2 1 2.73 2.68 2.74 2.68 2.67 
2 2 3.48 3.37 3.50 3.37 3.36 
3 2 4.12 3.95 4.16 3.95 3.93   
Example: What weight can be lifted by a tackle using %4’”" rope and 
having three sheaves in the fall block and two in the movable block if a 
pull of 100 pounds is applied to the fall rope? 
Solution: Looking under column of table %4"" rope we find opposite 
the number of sheaves given 4.12. Multiplying the pull in pounds, 100 
by this ratio factor gives 412 pounds as the weight that could be lifted 
with this tackle and force acting as described. If the question were: how 
great a force would be required to raise a weight of 412 pounds with this 
tackle, the process would be reversed and the weight divided by this factor.

  CHAPTER XIX 
CONCRETE IN FARM PRACTICE 
WrrHIN recent years the use of concrete in farm practice has 
become extensive. Sanitary education has pointed out the necessity 
of non-absorbent, easily cleaned floors in dairy stables and other 
Ht Ca 
  Fig. 305.—Interior of sanitary barn. Concrete floor and mangers. (Portland Cement Association.) 
farm buildings where human food is produced. At the same time 
the increasing cost of lumber and its susceptibility to decay have 
shown the need of a more permanent building material where con- 
ditions of wear or dampness occur. Concrete best meets these 
conditions, and can be largely made from local materials by farm 
labor (Fig. 305). 
Concrete is an artificial stone resulting from an intimate 
mixture of cement with inert materials as sand, gravel and water. 
298
-P-A-G-E-313
  
STORING CEMENT 299 
When first mixed it is plastic, and may be given any shape desired 
by the use of suitable forms or molds. In about a week’s time it 
becomes hard, dense, wear-resistant and permanent. These qualities 
gradually increase with age. 
Cement is the active ingredient of concrete. It is made by 
combining two materials, one rich in lime and the other carrying a 
high percentage of clay, as limestone and shale, in certain definite 
proportions. The materials are pulverized and burned at a high 
heat, and the resulting clinker ground to a flour-like fineness, form- 
ing the light gray powder known as Portland cement. The name 
“Portland” was given to cement manufactured by this process 
because of the resemblance of concrete made from it to building 
stone quarried on the island of Portland, near England. A standard 
brand of Portland cement is a uniform, reliable product, and may 
be depended upon to give satisfactory results when properly used. 
Natural cement is made from rock which contains the necessary 
ingredients naturally combined in approximately correct pro- 
portions. It lacks the extreme strength and uniformity of cement 
made by the Portland process. 
Method of Packing.—Portland cement is marketed in paper 
sacks or cloth bags, containing approximately one cubic foot each 
and weighing 94 pounds net. Four of these units constitute a barrel 
containing 376 pounds of cement, the unit by which it is usually 
sold. For farm use the cloth sack container is preferable, as there 
is less waste through tearing. The sacks are charged to the con- 
sumer when the cement is bought, but are redeemable at their pur- 
chase price when empty and returned to the dealer in good order. 
Storing Cement.—Cement should be stored in a dry place. If 
stored on an earth or concrete floor planks should first be laid down 
and covered with tarred paper to prevent the passage of moisture 
to the cement. Where moisture laden air is likely to blow over the 
pile of cement cover it with a tarpaulin or building paper. 
Aggregates are materials mixed with cement to give bulk to 
the resulting concrete. Sand and gravel or crushed rock are the 
aggregates in most common use. Sand is usually spoken of as “ fine 
aggregate,” and includes all particles from the finest up to those 
that will just pass through a 14-inch mesh screen. Screened gravel 
or crushed stone is called “ coarse aggregate,” and includes all stone 
ranging from 44-inch up. The maximum size of coarse aggregate 
should not exceed in diameter one-third of the thickness of the work
-P-A-G-E-314
  300 CONCRETE IN FARM PRACTICE 
in which it is placed. The strength of concrete depends lero 
upon the proper selection and combination of the aggregate. 
Sand should be clean, coarse, hard, and bright with ated el 
well graded in size from 14 inch down. There should be no clay, 
loam or vegetable matter present, as it weakens the concrete. Loam 
may be injurious either chemically or mechanically. An acid may 
be present which will retard the setting of the cement, or it may coat 
the sand grains and prevent the cement from adhering to them. 
Bank run gravel is the most frequently used farm aggregate. 
It should be clean, free from clay, loam and vegetable matter, and 
  Fra. 306.—Gravel bank or pit, showing top soil falling down and mixing with aggre- gate. Soil should be “stripped” before gravel is taken for concrete work. (Portland Cement Association, 111 West Washington Street, Chicago.) 
should contain a large amount of hard, well-rounded pebbles, 
ranging in size from 44 inch up to 1% or 2 inches. Gravel or 
stone containing many flat pieces should not be used, as they tend to 
bridge over, forming “ stone pockets ” in the concrete. Care should 
be taken in getting the gravel from the bank to strip back the top 
soil, preventing it from mixing with the gravel (Fig. 306). When 
properly used, gravel forms an ideal aggregate. 
Screening Gravel—Bank run gravel almost invariably con- 
tains too much sand, and, in addition, is usually arranged in strata 
so that it is not uniform in sand and pebble content. The use of 
gravel without screening results in one of two things: 
1. An inferior grade of concrete will be produced, or 
2. If concrete of maximum strength is made more cement will be 
used than would be otherwise necessary.
-P-A-G-E-315
  PROPORTIONING A CONCRETE MIXTURE 301 
Before use, gravel should be passed over a 14-inch mesh screen, 
and the portion passing the screen considered as sand. The sand 
and pebbles can then be recombined in the proportions desired. 
Proportioning a Concrete Mixture.—To obtain a hard, dense 
concrete certain rules must be followed in proportioning. Gravel 
or stone carries a certain percentage of voids, as may readily be 
proved by adding water to a pail filled with stone. 
The exact percentage of the voids will vary with the character 
of the stone. Stone that is rounded in shape and kin] 
well graduated in size will show less void space is 
han will a stone that is uniform in size. 
While not so easily demonstrated, the same 
is true of sand. In general these spaces 
will approximate 30 to 50 per cent of F%*7 
the whole. It is common prac- 
ice to arbitrarily assume the 
void spaces in gravel to be 50 seer 
per cent, and to use half as 
much sand as gravel for the Fic. 307.—Proportioning concrete, Volume ting f ixing 1 cu. ft. t, 2 cu. ft.

hese void spaces in mind, Taylor and Thompson, in “ Concrete, 
Plain and Reinforced,” have established four arbitrary proportions 
covering, with slight modifications, the range of work ordinarily 
found. Their recommendations, with modifications adapting them 
to farm use, follow: 
1. Rich Mixture.—1: 1-4: 3, or one sack of cement, 1-14 cubic feet 
of sand and three cubic feet of crushed stone or screened gravel. Used 
where a very dense strong concrete is required as im concrete fence posts, 
supporting columns and thin reinforced walls that must be exceptionally 
strong and water-tight. 
2. Standard Mixture—Il: 2: 4, or one sack of cement, two cubic 
feet of sand and four cubic feet of crushed stone or screened gravel. Used 
for reinforced floors, monolithic silo walls, corner posts and columns of 
larger cross-section, cisterns, watering troughs and machine foundations. 
3. Medium Mixture.—1: 2-%: 5, or one bag of cement, 2-14 cubic 
feet of sand and five cubic feet of crushed stone or screened gravel. Used 
for barn floors, feeding floors, barnyard pavements, sidewalks, foundation 
walls above ground and retaining walls. 
4. Lean Mixture.—1: 3: 6, or one bag of cement, three cubic feet of 
sand and six cubie feet of crushed stone or screened gravel. Used for 
footings and foundation walls below ground, heavy walls and similar work.

MEASURING THE MATERIALS 303 
Thorough mixing is essential to successful concrete work. 
Machine mixing is preferable to hand mixing, as good concrete 
can be secured more cheaply by this method. Small mixers are 
now on the market, capable of handling a one-bag batch, that 
are a useful part of farm equipment. 
For small jobs a mixing box about 314 feet x 10 inches x 6 
feet, made with a tight, smooth bottom makes the most con- 
venient arrangement for combining the cement and aggregate. 
  Fia. 308.—Tools used in mixing and laying conerete: A, gravel screen; B, trowel; C, water barrel for cleaning tools; D, hoe for mixing; H, shovel for placing concrete; F’, garden rake for settling concrete in place; G, hatchet for sharpening stakes and setting forms; H, wood float for finishing; I, tamper for preparing cinder or gravel foundation; J, mixing box; K, straight edge. 
It can be easily moved about, keeping it next to the work, and 
the concrete shoveled directly into the forms. Figure 308 shows 
equipment commonly used in mixing and placing concrete. 
Clean water should be used in mixing concrete. Impure 
water may retard or prevent setting. The quantity of water used 
in mixing the first batch should be measured and the same 
amount used in each subsequent batch, making the concrete uni- 
form in consistency. 
Measuring the Materials—To secure a uniform concrete, 
the materials must be measured. This is most conveniently done 
by preparing a bottomless box (Fig. 309) of a size sufficient to 
hold the fine aggregate, filling it once with the sand and twice

patted water will rise to the surface and the mass will quake or 
shake like jelly. This is called a “ quaking ” mixture, and is easily 
compacted into forms. Where thin walls are being “ poured,” stones 
are to be imbedded, or reinforcement used, a wetter mixture may be 
necessary. Use the driest mixture possible with character of the 
work being done to secure greatest strength. 
Placing the Concrete.—Concrete should be placed in the forms 
promptly when thoroughly mixed. It begins setting within about 
thirty minutes after the addition of water, and should not be dis- 
turbed afterward, as its strength is lowered by so doing. When 
placed in the form it should be spaded or rammed to compact it.
-P-A-G-E-319
PLACING THE CONCRETE 305 
Working a spade between the concrete and forms (Fig. 311) forces

Concrete should be placed 
in layers not exceeding 6 
inches in depth, and the work

surface of the wall with their

the concrete when placed directly in a trench as in building 
foundations. 
Rubble Concrete.—-When placed in masces, up to 50 per cent 
of hard, round field stone can be added to concrete as it is placed. 
This results in a considerable saving of cement. The concrete must 
be worked compactly around the stones, avoiding open places in 
the wall. 
Finishing.—A wood float gives the most satisfactory finish for 
general farm use. A floor or walk, finished with a wood float is 
less slippery and better wearing than one troweled with a metal 
trowel. A pleasing finish for walls may be secured by applying 
cement and water, mixed to the consistency of cream, as quickly as 
the forms can be removed. Apply with a whitewash brush. 
The strength of concrete is dependent upon a number of fac- 
tors. Chief among these are: 
1. Quality and character of the aggregate used. 
2. Proportion of cement used in the mixture. 
3. Care used in mixing and placing the concrete. 
Taylor and Thompson give the following as safe loading to 
apply steadily to concrete that has been properly placed, and has 
thoroughly hardened.

Necessity of Reinforcing Concrete.—Concrete is strong in 
compression but is relatively easy to pull apart. This makes it 
necessary to use a reinforcing material high in tensile strength 
when it is required to withstand a pull. Mesh reinforcement is fre- 
quently used where the concrete is placed in slabs and has to with- 
stand temperature changes. Due to expansion and contraction, 
cracks may develop without its use. 
A beam supported as in figure 313 tends to bend under a load 
applied at the middle. As it bends the material in the bottom of the 
beam is under tension or is being stretched. Concrete being rela- 
tively weak in tensile strength, fails by breaking as indicated unless 
provision is made to care for the tensile stress. A steel rod imbed- 
ded as shown in figure 314 will care for the tension on the under 
side of the beam.

  308 CONCRETE IN FARM PRACTICE 
A general rule for placing reinforcement is: Place reinforce- 
ment in the side of the concrete that would be stretched should the 
piece bend under a load. It should be near the surface with only 
sufficient concrete covering it to protect it. Figure 315 shows posi- 
tion of reinforcement in typical cases. | 
Materialto Usefor Reinforcement.—Steel is the material used 
in reinforcing concrete. (1) It has great tensile strength, being 
" strong where concrete is 
weak. (2) It makes a good 
bond with concrete, Beta 
ting the concrete to obtain 
a firm grip upon its sur- 
face. (3) It has practically 
the same coefficient of expan- 
sion as concrete, shrinking 
and elongating to the same 
extent under ordinary 
changes in temperature. 
Steel rods are made for 
this purpose in various sizes. 
§ Ordinary steel rods obtained 
from the local blacksmith 
shop should not be used as 
they stretch slightly under 
tension. 
  Fra. 316.—Typical wall form, showing braces, spacing blocks, and tie wires. (Portland Cement For most farm uses woven Association.) wire fencing makes a most: 
satisfactory reinforcing material, but it is difficult to keep in posi- 
tion while placing the concrete. 
Forms.—Concrete when first mixed, must be supported by 
forms until it has hardened sufficiently to retain its shape. 
Forms for Wall Building.—Unseasoned pine or spruce ship- 
laps make the best materials for form building. They do not swell 
and warp when wet concrete is placed in contact with them, and 
are more readily fitted together than is matched material. For an 
exposed surface the form material should be planed, resulting in a 
smooth surface on the concrete, but where appearance is not essential 
any rough materials may be used that will retain it. 
Wet concrete is extremely heavy. Unless securely stayed, the 
forms will be sprung out of shape, resulting in a crooked wall of

uneven thickness. For ordinary walls a 2-inch by 4-inch upright 
placed about every 3 feet, with 1-inch boarding applied horizontally, 
will give sufficient strength if well braced. To prevent spreading, 
the uprights are wired together as shown in figure 316. Spacing 
blocks are used to keep the form walls at the proper distance apart, 
the forms being pulled up against them by inserting a short rod 
through the wire and twisting. 
Floor forms are usually made from 2-inch x 4-inch material 
placed edgewise, resulting in a floor 4 inches in thickness. The 
pieces used should be straight and surfaced on the upper edge, 
making a guide for a straight edge in striking off the surplus 
material. The supporting stakes are placed on the outside of the 
forms and the nails driven from the outside, permitting their easy

Handling Concrete in Cold Weather.—Concrete can be suc- 
cessfully used during freezing weather by heating the aggregate, 
water, and cement, and protecting the concrete after placing to 
conserve this heat. Gravel and sand are most easily heated by 
making a sheet-iron arch on which the materials are piled, and 
maintaining a fire in the arch. Carefully protect the placed con- 
crete by using straw, canvas, blankets, or sacks. Do not use manure, 
because of a possible chemical effect on the green concrete.

  CHAPTER XX 
GAS ENGINES—INSTALLATION AND CARE 
DEVELOPMENT of the internal combustion motor and its appli- 
cation to agricultural uses have made it a leading farm power. The 
ractor is used in heavy field operations of plowing, seeding, and 
harvesting, where its immunity to heat and fatigue make it superior 
o animal power; marketing facilities are increased by the long 
hauling radius of the truck and automobile, and much of the chore 
work is done by the small stationary engine. Its automatic features, 
convenience, and low cost of operation make it particularly desirable 
or this work. 
The Internal Combustion Motor.—QGasoline and oil engines 
are heat engines, known as internal combustion motors. They are 
so called because the fuel is burned within the cylinder directly 
ehind the piston. 
Principle of Operation.—The operation of an internal com- 
bustion motor may be compared to the loading and firing of a gun. 
A charge of highly combustible fuel is ignited and burned behind 
he piston. The resulting expansion forces the piston outward, in 
the same way that the bullet is expelled from the gun barrel. 
This provides for one outward stroke of the piston only. To 
make the operation continuous, the burned gases must be forced 
‘from the cylinder, fresh gases admitted, the piston returned to its 
original position, and the fresh gases ignited. The above events are 
performed automatically and constitute the gas engine cycle. 
A cycle is a chain of events that is completed in regular order, 
returning to the point of beginning. For example, the regular 
recurrence of spring, summer, fall, and winter make up a 
seasonal cycle. 
Operation of a Four-cycle Engine.—The common farm engine 
requires two complete revolutions of the crank-shaft, necessitating 
four strokes of the piston, two outward and two inward, to com- 
plete the cycle. It is therefore called a four-stroke cycle. An 
engine operating in this way is commonly called a “ four-cycle 
engine.” The four strokes of the cycle are:   
1, Suction or admission. 3. Power. 
2, Compression, 4, Exhaust. 
316
-P-A-G-E-331
COMPRESSION STROKE 317 
1. Suction or Admission Stroke.—The fly-wheel is revolved 
in the direction of the arrow (Fig. 330) by momentum or some 
external force. This results in pulling the piston out from the 
closed end of the cylinder, and creates a partial vacuum behind it. 
Air, under atmospheric pressure, rushes in through the admission 
we 
  
      
      
  
          
  
  F1a.330.—Diagram of suction or intake stroke of a four-cycle gas-engine. Piston is moved 
forward and partial vacuum created behind it in the cylinder. Admission valve A opens 
under outside pressure and air rushes through intake passages into cylinder, picking up a charge of atomized fuel as it does so, as it passes through the mixing chamber. Exhaust valve 
B is closed. 
Fie. 331.—Compression stroke. Both valves are closed. Piston is forced back into 
the cylinder by the momentum of the fly-wheel and the imprisoned gases are compressed in 
the combustion chamber. The piston does not go clear to the head but leaves a space equal 
to about } of the contents of the engine cylinder, compressing the gases to about five times atmospheric pressure when the engine is working at full throttle. 
Fic. 332.—Power stroke. Near the end of the compression stroke the spark occurs 
which ignites the compressed gases, causing an explosion or very rapid burning within the cylinder. The resulting high pressure forces the piston out on the power stroke. Both valves, A and B, being closed, the pressure acting against the piston, forcing it outward, and 
through the medium of the crank and connecting rod, produces the turning effort. 
Fie. 333.—Near the end of the power stroke the exhaust valve B is opened by the 
action of the cam on the half-time gears transmitted through the push rod and rocker arm. 
The piston, as it is forced back by the momentum of the fly-wheel, forces the burned gases out 
through the exhaust valve passage. 
valve A to relieve this vacuum, and in so doing picks up a spray of 
fuel from the needle valve orifice, filling the cylinder with a highly 
combustible vapor mixed with air. 
2. Compression Stroke.—The admission valve is now closed 
and the piston forced back into the cylinder by the revolution of the 
fly-wheel (Fig. 331), compressing the gases into about one-fifth 
of their original volume in the closed end of the cylinder. This 
results in greater power when the gases are ignited. 
 
-P-A-G-E-332
  318 GAS ENGINES—INSTALLATION AND CARE 
3. Power Stroke.—Just before the piston reaches the inner 
end of its travel in the compression stroke, the gases are ignited by 
an electric spark within the cylinder. The resulting quick com- 
bustion produces a high degree of heat and consequent pressure in 
the confined gases, forcing the piston outward and producing the 
power stroke (Fig. 332). 
4. Exhaust Stroke.—Near the end of the outward travel of the 
piston on the power stroke the exhaust valve is opened and the 
  Fig. 334.—Se al view of semi-Diesel farm engine. This engine has no ignition devices 
and ignites its fuel by the heat of compression. (Sears Roebuck and Co.) 
piston returning to the closed end of the cylinder pushes the burned 
gases out (Fig. 333). 
This completes the cycle. On the next forward stroke of the 
piston a charge of gases is drawn into the cylinder and the cycle of 
events continued. A power impulse is received only once in every 
two revolutions. Where but a single cylinder is used power for 
completing the other three strokes of the cycle, as well as for driving 
the machinery in use must be obtained from the momentum of the 
fly-wheel. 
The two-cycle engine performs the operations of admission, 
compression, combustion, and exhaust in two strokes of the piston 
or one revolution of the engine. It is little used in farm practice.
-P-A-G-E-333
THE EXHAUST VALVE 319 
Engines of the semi-Diesel type in which the liquid fuel is 
fed to the cylinder by gravity are now being made for farm use 
(Fig. 334). They are simple, have neither carburetor nor electri- 
cal ignition devices, as fuel is ignited by the high compression. 
Due to the high compression carried these are economical in 
operation, burning the low grade fuel oils satisfactorily. 
Gas Engine Timing.—The opening and closing of admission 
and exhaust valves and the production of the spark within the 
cylinder are termed “events ” in the gas engine’s cycle. In order

Fra. 335.—Timing of farm engine running at 500 R. P. M. Full line circle represents first revolution of cycle. Broken line represents second revolution of cycle. Diagonal lines represent position of center line of crank when eyents listed should occur. Intake valve should open 6-10° past H H D C and close 10-40° after C EZ D C has been passed. Points of opening and closing cannot be definitely controlled with automatic valves. Ignition takes place 25° before H # D C is reached. If oscillating magneto is used, give 10° to 15° more advance. Exhaust closes at H Z DC or a little beyond and opens 25° before HH D C is reached. Fie. 336.—Diagram of engine with timing marks on fly-wheel. The engine can be timed by bringing any point on the fly-wheel to coincide with reference point on frame, ad- justing the engine so that the event desired takes place at this point. 
that the engine may deliver maximum power with minimum fuel 
consumption, proper timing of valves is necessary. 
The Exhaust Valve.—The exhaust valve is set to open before 
the end of the power stroke is reached. The exact point of opening 
depends upon engine speed and design. Figure 335 shows the point 
in the revolution at which the exhaust valve should open on an 
engine running at 500 R. P. M. The exhaust valve should close at 
the head end dead center (H.H.D.C.) or slightly beyond it. 
The admission valve should open from 6 to 10 degrees after 
the crank has passed the H.H.D.C. and should remain open until the 
crank has passed slightly beyond the crank end dead center 
(C.E.D.C.). The point of closing should vary with the speed and 
design of the engine, and will range from 10 to 40 degrees after 
C.E.D.C. has been reached. 
Stationary farm engines are usually equipped with automatic 
inlet valves which do not permit timing, opening under atmos-  
-P-A-G-E-334
  320 GAS ENGINES—INSTALLATION AND CARE 
pheric pressure and closing by the tension of a spring. The spring 
should be only sufficiently strong to prevent chattering, giving the 
earliest opening and the latest closing possible. Valves may be 
timed by changing the length of the push rod. Lengthening the 
rod gives an early opening and late closing, and shortening the rod 
gives the reverse of this effect. Valve timing can also be changed 
by shifting the meshing of the timing gears one or more teeth for- 
ward or back. 
Ignition Timing.—An appreciable length of time is required 
for the flame to spread through the gases after the spark is pro- 
duced. To secure the greatest energy from the fuel it is necessary 
to have it all burning and ready to exert its greatest pressure on the 
piston when it starts forward on the power stroke. The spark, 
therefore, must be set to occur before H.E.D.C. is reached. The 
exact amount of advance is dependent upon engine speed and 
design, and the character of the fuel used. 
Rule for Spark Setting.—A general rule for spark setting is to 
give an advance of five degrees for every 100 R.P.M. made by the 
engine. This is sometimes increased to 8 degrees per 100 R.P.M. in 
the case of a make-and-break ignition system. Where an oscillating 
magneto is used 12 to 15 degrees should be added to the computed 
setting to provide time for the tripping mechanism to operate. 
Setting the Valves and Spark.—Manufacturers commonly 
place timing marks on their engines (Fig. 336), making it necessary 
only to bring the proper mark on the fly-wheel to correspond to the 
reference mark on the frame and when in this position to set the 
engine by adjusting the length of the push rod operating the ignitor 
or the valve being set. 
Where there are no timing marks the engine should be timed to 
the closing of the exhaust valve. The time of closing of this valve 
is least affected by conditions of speed and design of any of the 
events of the cycle. The engine is set on H.E.D.C. on the exhaust 
stroke and the exhaust valve adjusted to close at this point. The 
exact closing point of the valve is determined by inserting a piece 
of thin, tough paper between the rocker arm and the valve stem 
(Fig. 337). The paper will be pinched between them as long as the 
valve is held open, but will be released when it seats. With the valve 
set to close at the proper point the shape of the operating cam will 
usually cause it to open where it should. The point of opening can
-P-A-G-E-335

be checked by noting when the paper begins to be pinched as the fly- 
wheel is turned forward. 
Establishing H.E.D.C. and C.E.D.C. by the Tram Method.— 
These points can be most accurately determined by the “tram” 
method. A simple tram is made as shown in figure 338. 
To use the tram the engine is turned forward until it has com-

pleted from two-thirds to three-fourths of its outward stroke and 
the distance from the piston to the open end of the cylinder carefully 
measured. With the engine in 
this position the tram is set up 
and a mark made on the chalked 
surface of the fly-wheel (Fig.

Ignition Systems.—T wo general types of ignition systems are 
in common use on farm engines: (1) the make-and-break or low 
tension system, and (2) the jump spark or high tension system. 
The make-and-break or low tension system uses a low volt- 
age current. It is not capable of jumping across a fixed gap and 
consequently the ignitor is designed with one movable electrode 
(Fig. 339). The fixed electrode is insulated from the block by a 
mica bushing, while the movable electrode is grounded to the
-P-A-G-E-337

engine permitting the engine to be used as one side of the ignition 
circuit. A spark coil is introduced into the circuit to induce a cur- 
rent of sufficient pressure to arc across the gap when the circuit is 
broken and ignite the gas about the points. Figure 340 shows the 
method of wiring a typical make-and-break system. 
The jump spark or high tension system uses a spark plug 
with a small fixed gap, across which the electric current is forced 
to jump. The resulting spark ignites the charge. Air under pres- 
sure, as it is in the gas engine 
cylinder, offers great resistance to 
electrical flow. This makes a high 
voltage current necessary to jump aS 
the gap. 
The induction coil is used to 
step up the low pressure battery 
current to the voltage required.  ,. 
It consists of two windings, pri-       
  
  2 
  mary and secondary, about an iron 
core. The primary winding con- 
sists of a few turns of compara- 
tively coarse, insulated copper wire 
through which the battery current 
flows, and is provided with a 
vibrator and a condenser. The _ Fre, 340.—Method of wiring engine equipped with battery ignition and make- and-break ignitor. 1. Dry cells connected in series, zine to carbon. 2.

secondary winding, composed of 
many turns of very fine insulated copper wire, is wound over the 
primary winding (Fig. 341). The condenser serves to absorb and 
equalize electrical shocks and tends to prevent sparking at the 
vibrator’s points. The coil and wiring must be kept dry. The 
vibrator points should be kept flat with a magneto file, insuring that 
they meet squarely and so adjusted that they give a sharp, snappy 
buzz. A typical jump spark system is shown in figure 342. 
Sources of Current.—Batteries and magnetos are the sources 
of current commonly used in farm practice. The magneto is higher 
in first cost but has a longer life and gives a more uniform and 
dependable spark. 
The battery usually used is made up of No. 6 dry cells, from 4 
to 6 cells being wired up in series as shown in figures 340 and 342, 
A 4-cell battery connected up in this way should furnish a current

of about 6 volts and 25 to 30 amperes. A cell that tests less than 10 
amperes should be discarded. 
Magnetos may be divided into two general classes (1) rotary 
and (2) oscillating. The rotary magneto has a revolving inner 
part or armature which may or may not carry a winding, depending 
upon the design. A common type has a soft iron core shaped like 
a shuttle (Fig. 343), and carries a winding of insulated copper

Cooling System.—The burning of the fuel within the cylinder 
of an internal combustion motor produces great heat. Only about 
20 per cent. can be utilized in running the engine. This makes it 
necessary to provide a means of cooling the engine, as otherwise it 
would become so hot it would be destroyed. Two general methods 
are employed for controlling the temperature of farm engines, 
(1) air cooling, (2) liquid cooling.

is adapted to small farm engines used in intermittent service or 
running under light load; larger, slow moving, heavily loaded 
engines require liquid cooling. 
Liquid Cooling.—In this type of cooling system a jacket or 
hollow wall is cast about the 
cylinder, permitting the cir- 
culation of a liquid, usually 
water, about the heated parts 
of the motor.

As the speed of the engine rises above normal, the weight of the governor, which is caused to revolve by the bevel gears fly outward, causing the sliding sleeve to be pulled upward and the movable finger to be depressed. ‘This causes it to engage with the detent on the push rod, locking the exhaust valve open and preventing a new charge from being drawn in until the valve is released by the governor. 
Hopper Cooling System.—The cylinder jacket is left open at 
the top, forming a tank or hopper.

GOVERNORS 327 
Governors.—T wo general methods of controlling the speed of 
the farm engine are in use: (1) hit-or-miss governor, (2) throttling 
governor. Both of these governors use the principle of centrif- 
ugal force. 
The hit-or-miss governor acts on the exhaust valve, admission 
valve and ignition. As long as the engine runs at or below normal 
speed it is inoperative, but as soon as the speed reaches a point above 
normal it locks open the exhaust valve, locks the intake valve closed 
and prevents the ignition device from making contact (Fig. 346).

Fic. 347.—Diagram of throttling governor. As speed increases, fly balls swing out- ward, lifting the sliding sleeve and closing the throttle, lessening the quantity of fuel mixture admitted to the cylinder. 
This prevents the engine from making another power stroke until 
the speed has again fallen, and they are released. This system is 
adapted for use on single cylinder engines, where a perfectly 
uniform speed is not essential, and where gasoline is used for fuel. 
The throttling governor controls the speed of the engine by 
lessening the quantity of fuel mixture admitted to the cylinder 
when the speed increases under the influence of a light load. This 
is accomplished by means of a butterfly valve, similar to the damper 
used in a stovepipe, placed in the intake passage between the carbu- 
retor and the cylinder, and controlled by the action of the governor 
weights (Fig. 347). When parallel with the intake passage a full 
quantity of vaporized fuel and air is admitted to the cylinder. As 
the speed increases the valve is gradually swung at right angles to 
the passage by the governor until very little fuel is admitted.  
-P-A-G-E-342
  328 GAS ENGINES—INSTALLATION AND CARE 
Fuels.—Gasoline vaporizes easily, is highly inflammable, and 
burns cleanly. Although higher in first cost than kerosene, it is 
recommended for small engines, particularly where they are used 
indoors or for intermittent service. 
Kerosene contains more ‘energy than gasoline, but due to its 
heavier nature, does not atomize as freely, and is seldom so com- 
pletely utilized by the engine. It has a tendency to work down past 
the piston rings into the crank case, diluting the oil and causing 
lubricating difficulties. Its 
lower cost adapts it to use 
in large engines operating 
continuously throughout the 
day. Many tractor owners, 
however, use gasoline for all 
work during the cold months 
because of starting and lubri- 
ZF cating advantages.

348 is a diagrammatic representation of the principle of a simple 
float feed carburetor. The air rushing through the passage to the 
cylinder of the engine on the intake stroke, picks up a quantity 
of fuel from the orifice and atomizes it, the action being exactly 
the same as that of the common hand cattle sprayer. The gasoline 
level at the orifice is maintained by the supply in the float chamber 
which is connected to the tank and controlled by a float and 
needle valve 1. 
Methods of Lubrication.—A common type of lubricator used 
on stationary gas engines is the slight feed gravity oiler shown in 
figure 349. This should be adjusted to feed from 6 to 15 drops per 
minute on the usual farm engine. The exact amount cannot 
be given, as the size of the drops vary with the temperature and 
the character of the oil used. Sufficient oil should be used to give 
a slight trace of bluish smoke at the exhaust. 
For tractors, the constant level splash system is almost uni- 
yersally used, In this method of oiling (Fig. 350) shallow troughs

are provided in the crank case into which the connecting rods dip 
at each revolution, throwing a spray of oil to all interior parts of the 
engine. The oil level in the troughs is maintained by a pump which 
circulates it from a sump or oil reservoir, the oil being used over 
and over. Oil must be added at intervals, and the crank case should 
be drained and the oil completely changed at periods averaging 
from 30 to 50 hours’ service with kerosene or 40 to 75 hours’ work 
where gasoline is used as a fuel. The directions of the manufac- 
turer should be carefully followed in this. 
Common Gas Engine Troubles.—Some of the more common 
gas engine troubles with their remedies are given in the following 
trouble chart. Special troubles can best be located and corrected 
by following the directions given by the manufacturer. When 
hunting the source of trouble do not take things apart indis- 
criminately but rather follow one line of possible trouble through, 
making sure that all is right before attempting another adjustment.

Power Transmission.—The farm gas engine is usually used 
for a variety of work, making necessary some means of harnessing 
it to the different machines employed. A system consisting of a line 
shaft equipped with belt pulleys, connected to the machines by 
belting is used for this purpose. 
Shafting—Cold rolled steel shafting of the size known as 
114-inch is most satisfactory for farm use. This is finished all over, 
permitting the placing of a pulley or bearing at any point along its 
length. A line shaft should be supported parallel with the crank 
shaft of the engine driving it. The method of doing this is described 
in Job 7%. To prevent springing, bearings should be placed not more 
than 8 or 10 feet apart. 
Pulleys in common use are made of wood and are known as split 
pulleys, being made in halves and fastened together with bolts. This 
permits their application to a shaft at any point without its removal 
from the bearings. In ordering specify diameter, width of face, 
whether crowned or flat, and the diameter of the shaft upon which 
it is to be used. 
Shaft Hangers and Bearings.—Adjustable shaft hangers with 
self-aligning bearings lined with babbitt metal may be purchased 
for supporting the line shaft, but supports can be made that will 
answer every purpose. A bearing made from hard maple soaked in 
oil will last indefinitely in farm service. 
Belting is available for farm use in canvas, rubber, leather and 
balata. Of these rubber and canvas seem to best meet the demands
-P-A-G-E-347
  ARC OF CONTACT 333 
of farm service, the rubber for indoor work in dairies where damp- 
ness is encountered, and the canvas for silo filling, threshing and 
other hard service. 
Width of Belt Required.—A belt transmits power by friction ; 
its resistance to slipping on the pulley surface. The greater the 
power to be transmitted the wider the belt must be if conditions of 
belt speed, pulley surface and belt tension remain the same. A 
common mistake is to use too narrow a belt and then run it too taut 
driven 
  Fic. 351.—Right and wrong way of running belt. Where possible belt should be run horizontally with under side doing the driving. This increases the arc of contact and the tractive effort that the belt will transmit. Belt run as shown in B must.be run much tighter to carry the same power. 
in the effort to prevent slipping. Such treatment results in short 
belt life and increased wear on the bearings of the machine. 
A common rule for determining necessary belt width is based 
on the assumption that a belt 1 inch wide will transmit 1 horse- 
power when running at a speed of 800 feet per minute. As the belt 
speed is increased the power transmitting ability of the belt 
increases also. 
‘Rule 1. Horse power to be transmitted divided by belt speed in feet 
per minute over 800 equals width of belt required in inches. 
Rule 2. Belt speed in feet per minute equals diameter of pulley in 
feet times 3.1416 times revolutions made per minute. 
Arc of Contact.—The portion of the pulley coming in contact 
with the belt is known as the arc of contact. Other things being 
equal, the greater the are of contact the less the tendency to slip. 
With pulleys of equal size the are of contact is approximately 180
-P-A-G-E-348
  334 GAS ENGINES—INSTALLATION AND CARE 
degrees, or half the circumference of the pulley. Where one pulley 
is larger than the other the arc of contact is greater on the 
larger pulley. 
Where possible the belt should run in a horizontal position with 
the under side of the belt doing the driving (Fig. 351). Running a 
it crossed belt reverses 
the motion and in- 
creases the arc of con- 
tact between belt and 
pulley. It wears the 
belt, however, con- 
sumes power, and 
should be avoided 
where possible. 
Fitting Belts— 
The simplest way of 
obtaining the proper 
length of a belt is to 
place a steel tape about 
the pulleys in the 
position the belt is to 
occupy, and obtain the 
measurement direct. 
If the tape is not 
available a firm, non- 
stretching cord can be 
used for the same 
purpose. Where it is 
necessary to order 
belting before the 
  Fig. 352.—Ty, pes, of belt fasteners: 1, alligator belt : fastener; 2, clipper belt fastener; 3, crescent belt plates pulleys are in place, a with rivets; 4, belt hooks; 5, leather lacing. tae close approximation 
of the length can be obtained by the following rule: 
Rule——Add the diameters of the driving and driven pulleys in feet. 
Divide this sum by two and multiply the result by 3.1416. Add to this 
product two times the distance separating the centers of the pulleys. The 
result is the length of belt required. 
Joining the Ends.—Belts are joined by cementing, lacing, 
riveting, and by means of many types of patent fasteners (Fig. 352). 
Lacing with a rawhide thong is a suitable method for use in farm
-P-A-G-E-349
  CARE OF BELTS 335 
practice. To make a good joint the ends of the belt must be cut 
off square, and the lace holes spaced and punched accurately. A 
common mistake is the use of too wide a lacing thong and the use of 
too few holes in the belt ends.

Belts up to 3 inches wide may be laced with but one row of holes. 
Determining Pulley Speed.—Hvery farm machine has a 
proper speed for operation, and in driving it from an engine or line 
shaft it is necessary to determine the proper pulley size to give the 
machine the best operating speed. As a general rule it may be stated 
that in belting from one pulley to another the speed will vary 
inversely as the diameters of the pulleys, that is, if a pulley two feet 
in diameter is belted to one having a diameter of but one foot the 
speed of the smaller pulley will be twice that of the larger. Prob- 
lems of this kind fall under the following cases: 
Case 1—To determine the diameter of pulley required for a driven 
machine to give it a certain speed (R.P.M.) when the diameter and speed of 
the driving pulley are known. 
Rule.—Multiply the diameter of the driving pulley in inches by the 
speed (R. P. M.) and divide by the required speed of the driven pulley. 
Case 2.—To determine the necessary diameter of driving pulley when 
the speed is known, to give the required speed to a driven pulley whose 
diameter is given. 
Rule.—Multiply the diameter of the driven pulley in inches by its 
speed (R. P. M.) and divide the product by the speed at which the driv- 
ing pulley runs. The result will be the required diameter of the driving 
pulley. 
Care of Belts.—Belts should be kept clean and free from 
grease. Should a rubber belt of sufficient width for the load imposed 
upon it persist in slipping, apply a few drops of boiled linseed oil 
to the pulley side, or use a belt dressing recommended by the belt 
maker. Do not use soap, rosin or tar to make the belt hold, as they 
will ruin it.

no spark will pass. This is an excellent method for testing out oil soaked 
mica core plugs. 
6. If the construction of the plug does not permit taking apart, test 
it by placing several thicknesses of dry paper between the points to increase 
the resistance. Arrange spark plug with metal shell in contact with 
metal of engine (grounded), and bring high tension cable to top con-

nection of plug. A spark jumping to the top of the plug indicates a leak 
in the porcelain core unless it is seen to pass between the points of the plug. 
7. If the plug has been taken apart, reassemble it and by careful bend- 
ing adjust the points to the proper distance apart, using a worn dime 
as a thickness gauge if no other gauge is available. 
8. Bend outside electrode as shown in figure 354 so that oil drops 
will be led to one side instead of bridging across 
the gap.

be cranked while making test. Failure to secure a 
spark indicates a break in the ignition circuit, a disconnected wire or a 
dead battery. Test wiring and connections. 
2. Turn engine so that ignitor points within the cylinder are separated. 
They can be held in this position while cranking by removing ignitor trip 
if it is necessary to crank engine because of use of magneto. Snap igni- 
tion wire on insulated electrode. No spark should result. A spark indicates 
defective insulation about stationary electrode. 
3. Again turn the engine so that the ignitor points are forced together 
and snap ignition wire on stationary electrode, A spark should result. 
No spark indicates that scale, corrosion or wear is preventing the points 
from making electrical contact as they should. 
4. When trouble is located remove the ignitor block from the engine 
and correct trouble by cleaning or adjustment. If points are badly scaled 
or pitted clean by scraping or by use of magneto file. Do not use sand paper. 
Job 3.—Cleaning Carbon from an Engine Cylinder.— 
Through continued use, poor fuel adjustment or the use of poor 
lubricating oil, a carbon deposit will form in the cylinder, causing 
overheating and pre-ignition, indicated by a sharp metallic pound 
when the engine is working hard. 
Operations,—1l. Remove the bolts securing the cylinder head, Also 
renfove such other parts of the engine as may be necessary to permit 
removal of the head. Use perfect fitting socket wrenches for the purpose 
if obtainable. 
2. Remove the head. If cylinder head sticks rap lightly with a mallet 
and bunt engine back against compression to loosen it. 
3. With sharp putty knife, mowing machine section or similar tool 
scrape all traces of carbon from the inside faces of the head and com- 
bustion chamber, leaving the surfaces clean and bright. i 
4, Wipe out carefully with clean oil moistened cloth.

  338 GAS ENGINES—INSTALLATION AND CARE 
5, Examine valves. If in poor condition fit by grinding. Valves should 
show a bright ring all around and should not have grooves or shoulders 
worn in them, If shouldered or blackened indicating the escape of gases, 
grind as directed in Job 4. If in good condition cut gasket and replace 
head as directed in Job 5. 
Job 4.—Grinding Valves.—The valves of an engine should 
make a perfect fit with their seat. Through use and wear they may 
develop leaks and must be ground to a gas-tight fit to hold the com- 
pression pressure. Leaky valves are indicated by a hissing noise

at the exhaust or intake passages when the engine is turned over 
against compression. 
Operations,—1. Remove head as directed in Job 3. 
2. Remove pins and springs holding valves to their seats. Examine 
valves and seats. If badly pitted or grooved use valve tools to cut new 
seat and surface valve. If only trouble is a groove cut around the valve by 
the seat forming a shoulder, it may be removed by careful filing, preserving 
the original angle of the valve. 
3. Apply a small quantity of valve grinding paste to the meeting sur- 
faces of the valve and seat. 
4. Insert valve in place with a light coil spring under it to lift it 
from its seat when the pressure of the valve grinding tool is released. 
The spring from the intake valve, if of the automatic type, may be used 
for this purpose. 
5. With a valve grinding tool made to fit the openings in the valve

head turn the valve back and forth on its seat, grinding it. The valve 
should not be turned through a full revolution and care should be taken 
to stop and start at a different point each time when the motion is reversed. 
(Fig. 355.) 
6. When valve paste ceases to “bite” take the tool from the valve 
letting it lift from the seat. 
Apply fresh grinding com- 
pound and grind as before, 
starting with the valve in a 
new position. 
7. Continue grinding in 
this way until the valve and 
seat show clean bright meet- 
ing surfaces clear around. 
8. Wipe valve and seat 
clean, being careful to get 
every particle of the grind- 
ing material cleaned from 
the valve and seat. 
9. Test grinding by 
making a series of pencil 
marks across the face of 
the meeting surfaces of both 
valve and seat with a lead 
pencil. The marks should 
extend parallel with the 
stem. Place valve in posi- 
tion and turn a part of a 
revolution back and forth. 
If valve fits perfectly the 
marks on both valve head 
and seat will be erased. 
Any marks remaining indi- 
cate the need of further 
grinding. 
10. Replace valves and 
springs in cylinder head, 
being careful to get them 
in their proper seats and 
making sure that the ex-

press springs and insert pins through stems making sure that they are 
securely locked by the retaining washer or other means provided for 
the purpose. 
11. Cut and apply gasket and head as directed in Job 5. 
Job 5.—Cutting and Applying a Cylinder Head Gasket; 
Replacing Cylinder Head.—Gas engines are provided with a fire- 
proof gasket between the machined meeting surfaces of the head 
and cylinder castings to insure a gas-tight fit. When head is removed 
for cleaning or valve grinding the gasket is frequently destroyed, 
necessitating the cutting of a new one. 
 
-P-A-G-E-354
  340 GAS ENGINES—INSTALLATION AND CARE 
Operations.—1 Clean the meeting surfaces thoroughly by scraping 
with a putty knife to remove all traces of old gasket material. 
2. Lay a sheet of tough hard paper over the inside surface of the 
eylinder head, hold firmly in position and tap lightly with hammer or smooth 
mallet around all edges of openings, cutting the paper through. Fig. 356.) 
3. Place this pattern 
on sheet asbestos gasket 
material, mark about 
openings, and cut out 
gasket. Make openings 
for stud bolts with hol- 
low punch of the proper 
size if available. Gasket 
when finished should fit 
freely and lie perfectly 
flat against the finished 
surfaces. 
4. Apply cup grease 
or cylinder oil to both 
sides of gasket. Put gas- 
ket in place on end of 
cylinder and put cylinder 
head in position. 
5. See that the head

bolts carefully and uniformly. Bolts are tightened by turning each up 
a little at a time, working around and around the head until all are 
uniformly tight. Drawing a single bolt up tight may result in breaking 
the bolt or distortion of the 
head. 
6. After engine has run 
and become heated again 
tighten up cylinder head 
bolts. If shellac is used on 
gasket shellac one side only, 
greasing the other, permit- 
ting easy removal for clean- 
ing purposes.

same time to provide for some expansion due to heat. Through 
use and abuse they become carbonized, worn or lose their elasticity, 
so that they no longer hug the walls, making their replace- 
ment necessary.
-P-A-G-E-355
  FITTING PISTON RINGS 341 
Operations.—l. Test engine by turning over against compression when well warmed up and lubricated. A hissing sound at the open end of the cylinder or breather pipe indicates leaking rings. Smoke issuing from the open end of cylinder accompanied by a coughing sound when 
the engine is running also 
indicate compression es- 
caping by the rings. 
2. If leaky rings are 
indicated, disconnect the 
connecting rod from crank 
and pull the piston from 
the cylinder. Retain bear- 
ing shims in their original 
position and mark the 
bearing cap so that it may 
be returned in the position 
in which found. 
3. Remove rings by 
carefully working three 
pieces of hack saw blade 
or other thin steel be- 
neath the ring at the joint 
and working them about Barre F ; 
until approximately equal- jing eis on Beery MGR ee ly spaced. This lifts the Ring should be supported at as many points as possible 
y ‘ by the fingers, and the position changed often to insure ring from its groove and eyon‘grinding. (J: I. Case Threshing Machine Co.) permits sliding it from the 
piston. Hang rings as removed on a nail so that they may be returned to 
original position if found to be all right when piston and rings are cleaned 
of carbon. Examine for fit with cylinder walls by looking for black spots 
on circumference of ring. 
A black spot indicates es- 
cape of gasses at this 
point. Parts of the ring 
in contact with cylinder 
walls are worn bright. 
Examine ring for wear by 
inserting it in cylinder 
and noting gap between 
ends. Gap should be about 
one-thousandth of an inch 
for each inch of cylinder 
diameter. See whether 
ring springs out against 
walls tightly indicating 
that it has retained its 
tension. 
4. Discard rings found

5. Clean ring grooves in piston carefully scraping out every particle 
of carbon and charred oil. (Fig. 357.) 
6. Fit new rings to piston by placing them in grooves they are to 
occupy and rolling them about piston. They should fit perfectly clear

groove without binding. (Fig. 358.) Should the ring be too thick grind 
on a sheet of fine emery cloth tacked to flat surface. Support ring uni- 
formly with fingers. (Fig. 359.) Test frequently and change position of 
finger tips often to insure grinding a perfectly flat surface. When fitted 
clean ring and groove thoroughly, 
7. When fitted to piston, place ring in cylinder, figure 360, and turn 
it about in the position it is to occupy, noting the width of the gap. Gap 
between ends should be as described in three to provide for expansion due 
to heat. If ring is too 
tight fit ends by remov- 
ing ring and filing care- 
fully between the ends. 
8. Place rings in 
position on piston by 
sliding them down over 
pieces of hack saw blade 
figure 361, placing the 
lower ring on first. Place 
each ring in the groove 
to which it was fitted. 
9. Coat outside of 
piston and rings with 
cylinder oil and replace 
in cylinder. Rings may 
be compressed and held 
in position by means of 
stove pipe wire twisted 
about them. See that 
piston is returned in 
original position so that

10. Attach connecting 
rod to crank taking care that all shims are replaced in original position 
and that their edges do not scrape on crank, removing oil film. If bearing 
is too loose adjust by removing shims of equal thickness from both sides 
until bearing fits properly when nuts are drawn up tight. 
11. Insert cotter pins or wire, locking nuts. 
  Job 7.—Putting up a Line Shaft——Where more than one 
machine is driven from a single engine a line shaft is required. By 
a proper selection of pulleys it permits driving a group of machines 
from the same engine, and at the same time gives each its proper 
operating speed. 
Operations.—1. Hold a straight edge against the finished surface 
of the balance wheel as shown in figure 362. 
2. Drop a plumb bob from each end, marking points A and B on 
the floor directly beneath each end of the straight edge. 
3. With a chalk line strike a line through these points, making a line 
on the floor at right-angles to the crank shaft of the engine.

to connect a motor to a driven machine. Unless ordered endless the 
ends must be joined by some means that will be strong and will run 
    Fic. 366.—Lacing a belt. Note use of belt awl for making lace holes in canvas belt 
smoothly over the pulley. Lacing with a leather thong is quickly 
done and is satisfactory for most farm uses. 
Operations.—1. Determine width of belt required to transmit power 
by method given on page 333. In this case assume 6” as width found. 
2. Measure length of belt required and purchase required amount. 
3. Square and cut off each end with sharp knife or chisel. 
4. Determine size, spacing and number of holes required in each end 
of belt from table, page 335. In case of 6” belt place first row of holes 
34" from end of belt with holes in end of row %” from edge of belt. Use 
six holes */,” diameter spaced 1-/,,.’ apart in the first row. Second row 
contains five holes placed 1-14” from the belt end with same spacing as 
front row, the holes being located midway between those in the first row. 
(Fig. 363.) 
5. When spacing is determined mark and punch holes for lacing thong. 
(Fig. 364.) Use dividers and square to get holes located accurately. Make 
holes with punch of size required. With canvas belt use belt awl.

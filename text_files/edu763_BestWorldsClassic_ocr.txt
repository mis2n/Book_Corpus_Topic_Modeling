BOSWELL’S INTRODUCTION TO DR. |: 
JOHNSON* . 
Mr. Tuomas Daviss the actor, who then kept: 
a bookseller’s shop in Russell street, Covent Gar- 
den, told me that Johnson was very much his: 
friend, and came frequently to his house, where 
he more than once invited me to meet him; but 
by some unlucky accident or other he was pre- 
vented from coming to us. 
Mr. Thomas Davies was a man of good under- / 
standing and talents, with the advantage of a 
liberal education. Tho somewhat pompous, he. 
was an entertaining companion; and his literary : 
performances have no inconsiderable share. of 
merit. He was a friendly and very hospitable, 
man. Both he and his wife (who has been cele- 
brated for her beauty), tho upon the stage for: 
many years, maintained a uniform decency ‘of 
character; and Johnson esteemed them, and lived 
in as easy an intimacy with them as with. any 
family which he used to visit. Mr. Davies: ree-

  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  ollected several of Johnson’s remarkable. say- 
ings, and was one of the best of the many imita- 
tors of his voice and manner, while relating them. 
He increased my impatience more and more to 
see the extraordinary man whose works I highly 
valued, and whose conversation was reported to 
be so peculiarly excellent. 
At last, on Monday the 16th of May, when I 
was sitting in Mr. Davies’ back parlor, after hav- 
ing drunk tea with him and Mrs. Davies, Johnson 
unexpectedly came into the shop; and Mr. Davies 
having perceived him through the glass door in 
the room in which we were sitting, advancing 
toward us, he announced his awful approach to 
me, somewhat in the manner of an actor in the 
part of Horatio, when he addresses Hamlet on 
the appearance of his father’s ghost—‘‘Look, my 
lord, it comes.’’? I found that I had a very 
perfect idea of Johnson’s figure from the portrait 
of him painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds soon after 
he had published his Dictionary, in the attitude 
’ of sitting in his easy chair in deep meditation; 
which was the first picture his friend did for him, 
which Sir Joshua very kindly presented to me, 
and from which an engraving has been made for 
this work. Mr. Davies mentioned my name, and 
respectfully introduced me to him. I was much 
agitated, and recollecting his prejudice against 
the Scotch, of which I had heard much, I said 
to Davies, ‘‘Don’t tell where I came from.’’ 
“From Scotland,’’ eried Davies, roguishly. ‘‘Mr. 
Johnson”? (said I), ‘*I do indeed come from 
Scotland, but I can not help it.”? I am willing 
to flatter myself that I meant this as light pleas- 
antry to soothe and conciliate him, and not as 
4

  an humiliating abasement at ‘the expense, of my” 
country. But however that might: be, this speech’: 
was somewhat unlucky; for with that. quickness: iy 
of wit for which he was so remarkable, h e seized > 
the expression ‘‘come from ‘Seotland,’? which T° 
used in the sense of being ofthat country; and”: 
as if I had said that I had come’away from iit, 
or left it, retorted, ‘‘ That, sir, I-find is what a very’, ° 
great many of your countrymen can ‘not help.”’ 
This stroke stunned me a good deal; and when 
he had sat down, I felt myself not a little ‘¢m- 
barrassed, and apprehensive of what might. come 
next. He then addrest himself to Davies: ‘‘ What, 
do you think of Garrick? He has refused me an 
order for the play of Miss Williams, because he 
knows the house will be full, and. that an order |.” 
would be worth three shillings. >? Hager to take. :; 
any opening to get into conversation with him, 
I ventured to say, ‘‘Oh, sir, I can not think Mr. 
Garrick would grudge such a. trifle to you.’’ ”. 
‘Sir’? (said he, with a stern’ look), ‘‘I have’ 
known David Garrick longer than you have done; ' 
and I know no right you have to talk to me on |’, 
the subject.’’ Perhaps I deserved’ this check; 
for it was rather presumptuons in me, an entire 
stranger, to express any doubt of the justice of..." 
hig animadversion upon his old acquaintance and 
pupil. I now felt myself much mortified, and 
began to think that the hope which I had long 
indulged of obtaining his acquaintance waa’ 
blasted. And in truth, had not .my ardor been” 
uncommonly strong, and my resolution uncom= ‘ 
monly persevering, so rough a reception might: 
have deterred me forever from making any ‘for 
ther attempts. . . . 
    
    
    
             
   
 
-P-A-G-E-15
    THE BEST OF THE WORLD'S CLASSICS 
  I was highly pleased with the extraordinary 
vigor of his conversation, and regretted that I 
was drawn away from it by an engagement at 
another place. I had for a part of the evening 
been left alone with him, and had ventured to 
make an observation now and then, which he 
received very civilly; so that I was satisfied that 
tho there was a roughness in his manner, there 
was no ill-nature in his disposition. Davies fol- 
lowed me to the door, and when I complained to 
him a little of the hard blows which the great 
man had given me, he kindly took upon him to 
console me by saying, ‘‘Don’t be uneasy. I can 
see he likes you very well.’” 
A few days afterward I called on Davies, and 
asked him if he thought I might take the liberty 
of waiting on Mr. Johnson at his chambers in 
the Temple. He said I certainly might, and that 
Mr. Johnson would take it as a compliment. So 
on Tuesday the 24th of May, after having been 
enlivened by the witty sallies of Messieurs Thorn- 
ton, Wilkes, Churchill, and Lloyd, with whom I 
had passed the morning, I boldly repaired to 
Johnson. His chambers were on the first floor of 
No. 1, Inner Temple Lane, and I entered them 
with an impression given me by the Rev. 
Dr. Blair,’ of Edinburgh, who had been intro- 
duced to him not long before, and described his - 
having ‘‘found the giant in his den’’; an ex- . 
pression which, when I came to be pretty well 
acquainted with Johnson, I repeated to him, and 
he was diverted at this picturesque account of 
himself. Dr. Blair had been presented to him

by Dr. James Fordyce. | At this time the. con- 
troversy concerning the pieces ‘published by Mr. © 
James Macpherson as translations of Ossian was 
at its height. Johnson had ‘all along denied: their 
authenticity; and what was still more provoking 
to their admirers, maintained that. they had no. 
merit. The subject having been: introduced by ° 
Dr. Fordyce, Dr. Blair, relying'on the internal - 
evidence of their antiquity, asked‘ Dr. Johnson 
whether he thought any man of a modern’ agé 
could have written such poems. Johnson replied, ' 
‘*Yes, sir, many men, many women, and many 
children.’? Johnson, at this time, did not know: 
that Dr. Blair had just published a Dissertation; 
not only defending their authenticity, but sé ..' 
riously ranking them with the poems of Homer . 
and Virgil; and when he was afterward informed 
of this circumstance, he exprest some displeasure : 
at Dr. Fordyce’s having suggested. the topic, and 
said, ‘‘I am not sorry that they got thus much 
for their pains. Sir, it was like leading one to 
talk of a book when the author is concealed be- : 
hind the door.’’ us 
He received me very courteously; but. it must 
be confest that his apartment and. furniture and, we 
morning dress were sufficiently'uncouth. His 
brown suit of clothes looked very rusty; he had: 
on a little shriveled unpowdered wig, which was | 
too small for his head; his shirt-neck and the ‘ 
knees of his breeches were looses his black worsted 
stockings ill drawn up; and he-had a pair of un-— . 
buekled shoes by way of slippers. But all these slov-. 
enly particularities were forgotten the moment that 
he began to talk. Some gentlemen, whom I do 
not recollect, were sitting with him; and when: 
7

  they went away, I also rose; but he said to me, 
“Nay, don’t go.’’ ‘‘Sir’’ (said I), ‘‘I am afraid 
that I intrude upon you. It is benevolent to allow 
me to sit and hear you.’? He seemed pleased 
with this compliment, which I sincerely paid him, 
and answered, ‘‘Sir, I am obliged to any man 
who visits me.’’ 
Ir 
JOHNSON’S AUDIENCE WITH GEORGE 
Irt* 
In February, 1767, there happened one of the 
most remarkable incidents of Johnson’s life, 
which gratified his monarchical enthusiasm, and 
‘which he loved to relate with all its cireum- 
‘stances, when requested by his friends. This was 
his being honored by a private conversation with 
his Majesty, in the library at the Queen’s house. 
He had frequently visited those splendid rooms 
and. noble collection of books, which he used to 
say Was more numerous and curious than he sup- 
posed any person could have made in the time 
which the King had employed. Mr. Barnard, the 
librarian, took care that he should have every 
accommodation that could contribute to his ease 
and convenience, while indulging his literary taste 
in that place; so that he had here a very agree- 
‘able resource at leisure hours. 
His Majesty, having been informed of his occa- 
sional visits, was pleased to signify a desire that

-P-A-G-E-18
JAMES BOSWELL 
    he should be told when Dr. '\Johngon eame next 
to the library. Accordingly, the next time that 
Johnson did come, as soon ag’he was fairly en- 
gaged with the book, on which; while he sat’ by 
the fire, he seemed quite intent,’ Mr. Barnard 
stole round to the apartment whete'the King was, 
and in obedience to his Majesty’s.commands men- 
tioned that Dr. Johnson was then in: the library. - 
His Majesty said that he was at leisure, and: 
would go to him; upon which Mr. Barnard took, 
one of the candles that stood on the King’s table: 
and lighted his Majesty through a suite of room 
till they came to a private door into the library 
of which his Majesty had the key.. Being entered, |: 
Mr. Barnard stept forward hastily to Dr. John-. 
son, who was still in a profound study, and whis- 
pered him, ‘‘Sir, here is the King.’? Johnson - 
started up, and stood still. -His Majesty ap- 
proached him, and at once was eourteously easy. 
His Majesty began by observing that he under- 
stood he came sometimes to the library; and then 
mentioned his having heard that the Doctor had 
been lately at Oxford, and asked. him if he was 
not fond of going thither. To which Johnson 
answered that he was indeed fond of. going to... 
Oxford sometimes, but was likewise glad to come 
back again. The King then asked him what they . 
were doing at Oxford. Johnson answered, he: 
could not much commend their diligence, but that. . 
in some respect they were mended, for they had.’ 
put their press under better regulations, and at 
that time were printing Polybius.. He was then 
asked whether there were better libraries at Ox- 
ford or Cambridge. He answered, he believed the. 
Bodleian was larger than any they had at Cam- 
9     
   
    
   
-P-A-G-E-19
  THE BEST.OF THE WORLD'S CLASSICS — 
-bridge;' at the same time adding, ‘‘I hope, 
whether we have more books or not thay they 
have at Cambridge, we shall make as good use 
of them as they do.’’? Being asked whether All- 
Souls or Christ Church library was the largest, 
he answered, ‘‘All-Souls library is the largest 
we have, except the Bodleian.’’ ‘‘Ay’’ (said the 
King), ‘‘that is the public library.’’ 
His Majesty inquired if he was then writing 
wnything. He answered he was not, for he had 
pretty well told the world what he knew, and 
faust now read to acquire more knowledge. The 
King, as it should seem with a view to urge him 
to rely on his own stores as an original writer, 
and to continue his labors, then said, ‘‘I do not 
think you borrow much from anybody.’? 
Johnson said he thought he had already done 
bis part as a writer. ‘‘I should have thought so 
too’’ (said the King), ‘‘if you had not written 
so well.’? Johnson observed to me, upon this, 
that ‘‘No man could have paid a handsomer com- 
pliment; and it was fit for a king to pay. It 
was decisive.’? When asked by another friend, 
at Sir Joshua Reynolds’s, whether he made any 
reply to this high compliment, he answered, ‘‘No, 
sir. When the King had said it, it was to be so. 
It was not for me to. bandy civilities with my 
Sovereign.’’ Perhaps no man who had spent his 
whole life in courts could have shown a more 
nice and dignified sense of true politeness than 
Johnson did in this instance. 
His Majesty having observed to him that he 
supposed he must have read a good deal, Johnson 
‘answered that he thought more than he read; 
that he had read a great deal in the early part 
10
-P-A-G-E-20
  JAMES BOSWELL. 
  of his life, but having fallen: into Pi health, he 
had not been able to read mueh compared with 
others: for instance, he said, ‘he had not read 
much compared with Dr. Warburton. Upon which 
the King said that he heard Dri Warburton was’: 
a man of much general knowledge; that you . 
eould scarce talk with him on, any subject on 
which he was not qualified to speak: and that 
his learning resembled Garrick’s acting: in its: | 
universality. His Majesty then talked of the: 
controversy between Warburton and Lowth, 
which he seemed to have read, and asked Johns 
what he thought of it. Johnson answered, ‘‘War-    
    burton has the most general, most scholastic ! 
learning; Lowth is the more correct scholar. I: 
do not know which of them calls names best.’’. 
The King was pleased to say he was of the same 
opinion: adding, ‘‘You do not think then, Dr. ' 
Johnson, that there was much argument in the 
ease?’’ Johnson said he did not’ think there was. 
‘Why, truly’’ (said the King), ‘Cwhen onee it 
comes to calling names, argument i is pretty well 
at an end.’’ 
His Majesty then asked him what he thought 
of Lord Lyttelton’s history, which was just then 
published. Johnson said he thought his style 
pretty good, but that he had blamed Henry the 
Second rather too much. ‘‘Why’’ (said the: 
King), ‘‘they seldom do these things by halves.’ 
‘No, sir’? (answered Johnson), ‘‘not to kings.” 
But fearing to be misunderstood, he proceeded to 
explain himself; and immediately subjoined,, 
‘‘That for those "who spoke worse of kings than 
they deserved, he could find no excuse; but that 
he could more ‘easily conceive how some one might 
li
-P-A-G-E-21
et 
THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  speak better of them than they deserved, without 
any ill intention: for as kings had much in their 
power to give, those who were favored by them’ 
would’ frequently, from gratitude, exaggerate 
their praises; and as this proceeded from a good 
motive, it was certainly excusable as far as error 
could be excusable.’’ 
_ The King then asked him what he thought of 
Dr. Hill. Johnson answered that he was an in- 
genious man, but had no veracity; and immediate- 
ly mentioned as an instance of it an assertion of 
that writer, that he had seen objects magnified 
to a much greater degree by using three or four 
microscopes at a time than by using one. ‘‘Now’’ 
(added Johnson), ‘‘every one acquainted with 
microscopes knows that the more of them he looks 
through, the. less the object will appear.’’ 
‘““Why’’ (replied the King), ‘‘this is not only 
telling an untruth, but telling it clumsily; for if 
that be the case, every one who ean look through 
a microscope will be able to detect him.’’ 
“I now’’ (said Johnson to his friends, when 
relating what had passed) ‘‘began to consider 
that I was depreciating this man in the estima- 
tion. of his Sovereign, and thought it was time 
for me to say something that might be more 
favorable.’’ He added, therefore, that Dr. Hill 
was notwithstanding a very curious observer; 
and if he would have been contented to tell the 
world no more than he knew, he might have been 
a very considerable man, and needed not to have 
recourse to’ such mean expedients to raise his 
reputation. 
The King then talked of literary journals, men- 
tioned particularly the Journal des Savants, and 
12
-P-A-G-E-22
  JAMES BOSWELL : 
    asked Johnson if it was well-done... Johnson said 
it was formerly very well done, and gave some 
account of the persons who began it, and carried 
it on for some years; enlarging: the same time 
on the nature and use of such ‘works. The King ° 
asked him if it was well done now. Johnson 
answered he had no reason to think that it. was. 
The King then asked him if there were any other 
literary journals published in this kingdom except 
the Monthly and Critical Reviews;. and on ‘being, — 
answered there was no other, his Majesty asked’: 
which of them was the best. Johnson answered, 
that the Monthly Review was done with most: 
care, the Critical upon the best principles; adding | * 
that the authors of the Monthly Review were 
enemies to the Church. This the King said he 
was sorry to hear. 
The conversation next .turned:on. the Philo- 
sophical Transactions, when Johnson observed 
that they had now a better method of arranging 
their materials than formerly. “‘Ay’’ (said the: 
King), ‘‘they are obliged to Dr. Johnson for 
that’’; for his Majesty had heard and remeth- 
bered "the circumstance, which Johnson himself. 
had forgot. 
His Majesty exprest a desire to have the lit- | 
erary biography of this country ably executed, | ‘ 
and proposed. to Dr. Johnson to undertake it. 
Johnson signified his readiness to comply with 
his Majesty’s wishes. . 
During the whole of this interview, Johnson’. : 
talked to his Majesty with profound respect, but’ 
still in his firm, manly manner, with a sonorous 
voice, and never in that subdued tone which is 
commonly used at the levee and in the drawing-. 
M 13 
   
-P-A-G-E-23

  room. After the King withdrew, Johnson showed 
himself highly pleased with his Majesty’s conver- 
sation and gracious behavior. He said to Mr. 
Barnard, ‘‘Sir, they may talk of the King as they 
will; but he is the finest gentleman that I have 
ever seen.’’ And he afterward observed to Mr. 
Langton, ‘‘Sir, his manners are those of as fine 
a gentleman as we may suppose Lewis the Four- 
teenth or Charles the Second.’’ 
At Sir Joshua Reynolds’s, where a circle of 
Johnson’s friends were collected round him to 
hear his account of this memorable conversation, 
Dr. Joseph Warton, in his frank and lively man- 
ner, Was very active in pressing him to mention 
the particulars, ‘‘Come, now, sir, this is an in- 
teresting matter; do favor us with it.’’? Jobn- 
son, with great good humor, complied. 
He told them: ‘‘I found his Majesty wished 
T should talk, and I made it my business to talk. 
I find it does a man good to be talked to by his 
Sovereign. In the first place, a man can not be 
in a passion—’’ Here some question interrupted 
him; which is to be regretted, as he certainly 
would have pointed out and illustrated many cir- 
eumstances of advantage, from being in a situa- 
tion where the powers of the mind are at once 
excited to vigorous exertion and tempered by 
reverential awe.

THE MEETING OF DR, JOHNSON AND JOHN WILKES“ 
T am now to record a very curious incident in Dr. 
Jobnson’s life which fell under my own’ observa- 
tion; of which pars magna fui, and which I am 
persuaded will, with the liberal-minded, ‘be much’: 
to his credit. cM 
My desire of being acquainted with celebrated. 
men of every description had made me, much" 
about the same time, obtain an introduction to: - 
Dr. Samuel Johnson and to John Wilkes, Esq. 
Two men more different could perhaps not be 
selected out of all mankind. They had even at- 
tacked one another with some asperity in their 
writings; yet I lived in habits of friendship with 
both. I could fully relish the excéllence of each; 
for I have ever delighted in that intellectual 
chemistry which can separate good qualities from 
evil in the same person. 
My worthy booksellers and friends, Messieurs 
Dilly in the Poultry, at whose. hospitable and 
well-covered table I have seen a greater number : 
of literary men than at any other except that of. 
Sir Joshua Reynolds, had invited me to meet Mr. 
Wilkes and some more gentlemen on Wednesday, 
‘From Boswell’s “Life of Johnson.” Wilkes was the famous publicist and political agitator. who was: expelled 
from Parliament, imprisoned and outlawed, but afterward |

    May 15th. ‘‘Pray’’ (said I), ‘‘let us have Dr. 
Jobnson.’’ ‘What, with Mr. Wilkes? not for 
the world’’ (said Mr. Edward Dilly): ‘‘Dr. John- 
son would never forgive me.’’ ‘‘Come’’ (said I), 
‘if you'll let me negotiate for you, I will be 
answerable that all shall go well.’’ 
Dilly: Nay, if you will take it upon you, I am 
sure I shall be very happy to see them both here. 
Notwithstanding the high veneration which I 
entertained for Dr. Johnson, I was sensible that 
he was sometimes a little actuated by the spirit 
of contradiction, and by means. of that I hoped I 
should gain my point. I was persuaded that if 
I had come upon him with a direct proposal, 
“Sir, will you dine in company with Jack 
Wilkes?’’ he would have fiown into a passion, and 
would probably have answered, ‘‘Dine with Jack 
Wilkes, sir! I’d as soon dine with Jack Ketch.’’ 
I therefore, while we were sitting quietly by our- 
selves at his house in an evening, took occasion 
to open my plan thus: . 
‘‘Mr. Dilly, sir, sends his respectful compli- 
ments to you, and would be happy if you would 
do him the honor to dine with him on Wednesday 
next along with me, as I must soon go to 
Scotland.*? : 
Johnson: Sir, I am obliged to Mr. Dilly. I will 
wait upon him— 
Boswell: Provided, sir, I suppose, that the 
company which he is to have is agreeable to you. 
Johnson: What do you mean, sir? What do 
you take me for? Do you think I am so ignorant 
of the world as to imagine that I am to prescribe 
to a gentleman what company he is to have at 
his table? .

  Boswell: I beg your pardon, sir, for wishing to 
prevent you from meeting people whom, you might 
not like. Perhaps he may have some of what he 
ealls his patriotic friends with him. ~ 
Johnson: Well, sir, and what then? What eare 
I for his patriotic friends? Poh!’ : 
Boswell: I should not be surprized to find Jack 
Wilkes there. 
Johnson: And if Jack Wilkes: should be there, 
what is that to me, sir? My dear friend, let. us 
have no more of this. I am sorry to be angry 
with you; but really it is treating me strangely 
to talk to me as if I could not meet any company 
whatever, occasionally. 
Boswell: Pray forgive me, sir: I meant well. 
But you shall meet whoever comes, for me. 
Thus I seeured him, and: told Dilly that he 
would find him very well pleased to be one of 
his guests on the day appointed. 
Upon the much-expected Wednesday I called 
on him about Half an hour before dinner, as I 
often did when we were to dine out together, to 
see that he was ready in time, and to accompany 
him. I found him buffeting his books, 2s upon 
a former occasion, covered with dust, and making 
no preparation for going abroad. ‘‘How is this, 
sir?’’ (said I). ‘‘Don’t you recollect that you are 
to dine at Mr. Dilly’s?’’ 
Johnson: Sir, I "aia not think of going to 
Dilly’s: it went out of my head. I have ordered 
dinner at home with Mrs. Williams. 
Boswell: But, my dear sir, you know you were 
engaged to Mr. Diy and I told him so. He will 
expect you, and will be much disappointed it 
you don’t come.

  Johnson: You. must talk to Mrs. Williams 
about this. 
Here was a sad dilemma. I feared that what 
I was so confident I had secured, would yet be 
frustrated. He had accustomed himself to show 
Mrs, Williams such a degree of humane attention 
as frequently imposed some restraint upon him; and 
I knew that if she should be obstinate, he would 
not stir. I hastened down-stairs to the blind 
lady’s room, and told her I was in great un- 
easiness, for Dr. Johnson had engaged to me to 
dine this day at Mr. Dilly’s, but that he had told 
me he had forgotten his engagement, and had 
ordered dinner at home. ‘‘Yes, sir’’ (said she, 
pretty peevishly), ‘‘Dr. Johnson is to dine at 
home.’’? ‘‘Madam’’- (said I), ‘‘his respect for 
you is such that I know he will not leave 
you, unless you absolutely desire it. But as 
you have so much of his company, I hope 
you will be good enough to forego it for 
a day; as Mr. Dilly is a very worthy man, 
has frequently had agreeable parties at his house 
for Dr. Johnson, and will be vexed if the Doctor 
neglects him to-day. And then, madam, be 
pleased to consider my situation: I carried the 
message, and I assured Mr. Dilly that Dr. John- 
son was to come; and no doubt he bas made a 
dinner, and invited a company, and boasted of 
the honor he expected to have. I shall be quite 
disgraced if the Doctor is not there.’’ 
She gradually. softened to my solicitations, 
which were certainly as earnest as most entreaties 
to-ladies upon any occasion, and was graciously 
pleased to. empower me to tell Dr. Johnson ‘‘that, 
all things considered, she thought he. should cer-

  tainly go.’’ IT flew back to’him, still in dust, and 
eareless of what should be the event, ‘‘indifferent 
in his choice to go or stay’’; but as soon as I 
had announced to him Mrs, Williams’s consent, | 
he roared, ‘‘Frank, a clean shirt,’’ and was very 
soon drest. When I had him fairly seated ina... 
hackney-coach with me, I exulted as much as a 
fortune-hunter who has got an heiress into a 
post-chaise with him to set out for Gretna Green, 
When we entered Mr. Dilly’s drawing-room, 
he found himself in the midst of a company he 
did not know. I kept myself snug and silent, 
watching how he would conduct himself. I ob- 
served him whispering to Mr. Dilly, ‘‘Who is. 
that gentleman, sir?’’ ‘‘Mr. Arthur Lee.’? 
Johnson: ‘‘Too, too, too’? (under his breath), 
which was one of his habitual mutterings. Mr. 
Arthur Lee could not but be very obnoxious to 
Johnson, for he was not only a patriot but an 
American. He was afterward minister from the 
United States at the court of Madrid. ‘‘And 
who is the gentleman in lace?’’? ‘‘Mr. Wilkes, 
sir.’ This information confounded him still 
more; he had some difficulty to restrain himself,

intently for some time, till he composed himself. 
His feelings, I dare say, were awkward enough, 
But he no doubt recollected his having rated me 
for supposing that he could be at all diseoncerted 
by any company, and he therefore resolutely set 
himself to behave quite as an easy man of the 
world, who could adapt himself at once to the 
disposition and manners of those whom he might 
chance to meet.

  The cheering sound of ‘‘Dinner is upon the 
table’’ dissolved his reverie, and we all sat down 
without any symptom of ill-humor. There were 
present, besides Mr. Wilkes, and Mr. Arthur Lee, 
who was an old companion of mine when he 
studied physics at Edinburgh, Mr. (now Sir 
John) Miller, Dr. Lettson, and Mr. Slater the 
druggist. Mr. Wilkes placed himself next to 
Dr. Johnson, and behaved to him with so much 
attention and politeness that he gained upon him 
insensibly. No man ate more heartily than John- 
son, or loved better what was nice and delicate. 
Mr. Wilkes was very assiduous in helping him 
to some fine veal. ‘‘Pray give me leave, sir— 
It is better here—A little of the brown—Some 
fat, sir—A little of the stuffing—Some gravy— 
Let me have the pleasure of giving you some 
butter—Allow me to recommend a squeeze of this 
orange; or the lemon, perhaps, may have more 
zest.’’ ‘Sir, sir, I am obliged to you, sir,’’ cried 
Johnson, bowing, and turning his head to him 
with a look for some time of ‘‘surly virtue,’’ but 
in a short while of complacency.

  JOHNSON’S. WEDDING-DAY * 
Tso Mrs. Porter was double the age of John- 
son, and her person and manner, as. described to 
me by the late Mr. Garrick, were by no means 
pleasing to others, she must have had a supe. 
riority of understanding and talerits, as she cer- 
tainly inspired bim with a more than ordinary 
passion; and she having signified her willingness: 
to accept of his hand, he went to Lichfield to" 
ask his mother’s consent to the marriage, which 
he could not but be conscious was a very im-. 
prudent scheme, both on account of their dis- 
parity of years, and her want of fortune. But 
Mrs. Johnson knew too well the ardor of her 
son’s temper, and was too tender a parent. to 
oppose his inclinations. 
know not for what reason the marriage cere- 
mony was not performed at Birmingham; but a 
resolution was taken that it should be. at Derby, 
for which place the bride and bridegroom set 
out on horseback, I suppose in very good humor. 
But tho Mr. Topham Beauelerk used archly to 
mention Johnson’s having told him, with much’ 
gravity, ‘‘Sir, it was a love marriage on both |)” 
sides,’’ I have had from my illustrious friend 
the following curious account of their journey.

  got into her head the fantastical notion that a 
woman of spirit should use her lover like a dog. 
So, sir, at first she told me that I rode too fast, 
and she eonld not keep up with me; and, when 
I rode a little slower, she passed me, and com- 
plained that I lagged behind. I was not to be 
made the slave of eaprice; and I resolved to 
begin as I meant to end. I therefore pushed on 
briskly, till I was fairly out of her sight. The 
road lay between two hedges, so I was sure she 
could not miss it; and I contrived that she should 
soon come up with me. When she did, I observed 
her to be in tears.’’ 
This, it must. be allowed, was a singular be- 
ginning of connubial felicity; but there is no 
doubt. that Johnson, tho he thus showed a manly 
firmness, proved a most affectionate and indul- 
gent. husband to the last moment of Mrs. John- 
son’s life: and in his ‘‘Prayers and Medita- 
tions,’’ we find very remarkable evidence that 
his regard and fondness for her never ceased, 
even after her death.

A POET DEFINED* 
Takine up the subject upon general grounds, 
I ask what is meant by the word Poet? What 
is a poet? To whom does he address himself? 
And what language is to be expected from him? 
He is a man speaking to men: a man, it is true, 
endued with more lively sensibility, more enthusi- 
asm and tenderness, who has a greater knowledge 
of human nature, and a more comprehensive soul, 
than are supposed to be common among man- 
kind; a man pleased with his own passions and 
volitions, and who rejoices more than other men 
in the spirit of life that is in him; delighting

“Lyrical Ballads,” published in 100. The poems in the 
first edition of “Lyrical Ballads,” published in 1798, had 
been the joint production of Wordsworth and Coleridge. The 
volume was published in Bristol by Cottle. It met with a 
cold, if not scoffing, reception, altho among its contents were 
the “Lines Written Above Tintern Abbey.” When OCottle’s 
publishing business was transferred to Longmans in--+799,

to contemplate similar volitions and passions as 
manifested in the goings on of the universe, and 
habitually impelled to create them where he does 
not find them. To these qualities he has added 
a disposition to be affected more than other men 
by absent things as if they were present; an 
ability of conjuring up in himself passions, which 
are indeed far from being the same as those 
produced by real events, yet especially in those 
parts of the general sympathy which are pleasing 
and delightful do more nearly resemble the pas- 
sions produced by real events than anything 
which, from the motions of their own minds mere- 
ly, other men are accustomed to feel in them- 
selves; whence, and from practise, he has ac- 
quired a greater readiness and power in ex- 
pressing what he thinks and feels, and especially 
those thoughts and feelings which, by his own 
choice, or from the structure of his own mind, 
arise in him without immediate external excite- 
ment. 
But whatever portion of this faculty we may 
suppose even the greatest poet to possess, there 
ean not be a doubt but that the language which 
it will suggest to him must, in liveliness and 
Cottle had paid the authors 30 guineas, was estimated at 
nothing. Cottle then presented the copyright to Wordsworth 
and Coleridge. Wordsworth, meanwhile, had written other 
poems and Longmans offered him £100 for a new and en- 
larged edition of “Lyrical Ballads,” restricted to his own 
verse and to which Wordsworth was to contribute an ex- 
planatory preface, the same being the ‘Preface’ which 
aroused & controversy now historical in the history of Eng- 
lish poetry. Crities were deeply incensed at Wordsworth's 
defense of his'own poems. The “Preface” was a revolution- 
ary proclamation against the taste in poetry which had been 
established in a previous century.

truth, fall far short of that which is uttered by 
men in real life, under the actual pressure of 
those passions, certain shadows: of which the 
poet thus produces, or feels to be produced, in 
himself. Pen! 
However exalted a notion we would wish to 
cherish of the character of the poet, it is obvious 
that, while he describes and imitates passions, 
his situation is altogether slavish and mechanical, 
compared with the freedom and power of real 
and substantial action and suffering. So that it 
will be the wish of the poet to bring his feelings 
near to those of the persons whose feelings he. 
describes, nay, for short spaces of time, perhaps, 
to let himself slip into an entire delusion, and 
even confound’ and identify his own feelings with 
theirs; modifying only the language which is thus 
suggested to him by a consideration that he 
describes for a particular purpose, that of giving 
pleasure. Here, then, he will apply the principle 
on which I have so much insisted, namely, that 
of selection; on this he will depend for removing 
what would otherwise be painful or disgusting in 
the passion; he will feel that there is no necessity 
to trick out or elevate nature; and, the more 
industriously he applies this principle, the deeper 
will be his faith that no words which his fancy 
or imagination can suggest will bear to be com- 
pared with those which are the emanations of | 
reality and truth. : 
But it may be said by those who do not object 
to the general spirit of these remarks, that, ds 
it is impossible for the poet to’ produce upon all 
occasions language as exquisitely fitted for the 
passion as that which the real passion itself sug- 
25
-P-A-G-E-35
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD'S CLASSICS eS 
gests, it is proper that he should consider himself 
as in the situation of a translator, who deems 
himself justified when he substitutes excellences 
of another kind for those which are unattainable 
by him; and endeavors occasionally to surpass 
his original, in order to make’ some amends for 
the general inferiority to whieh he feels that he 
must submit. But this would be to encourage 
idleness and unmanly despair. Further, it is the 
language of men who speak of what they do not 
understand; who talk of poetry as of a matter 
of amusement and idle pleasure; who will con- 
verse with us as gravely about a taste for poetry, 
as they express it, as if it were a thing as in- 
different as a taste for rope-dancing, or Fron- 
tignae, or Sherry. Aristotle, I have been told, 
hath said that poetry is the most philosophic of 
all writing; it is so: its object is truth, not in- 
dividual and local, but general and operative; 
not standing upon external testimony, but car- 
ried alive into the heart by passion; truth which 
is its own testimony, which gives strength and 
divinity to the tribunal to which it appeals, and 
reeeives them from the same tribunal. Poetry is 
the image of man and nature. The obstacles 
which stand in the way of the fidelity of the 
biographer and historian, and of their consequent 
utility, are incaleulably greater than those which 
are to be encountered by the poet who has an 
adequate notion of the dignity of his art. The 
poet writes under one restriction only, namely, 
that of the necessity of giving immediate pleasure 
to a human ‘being possest of that information 
which may be expected from him, not as a lawyer, 
@ physician, a mariner, an astronomer, or a nat- 
26
-P-A-G-E-36
  WILLIAM WORDSWORTH 
  ural philosopher, but as a man. Except this one 
restriction, there is no object: standing between 
the poet and the image of. things: between this 
and the biographer and the historian there are 
a thousand. 
Nor let this necessity of producing immediate 
pleasure be considered as a degradation of the 
poet’s art. It is far otherwise. It is an acknowl- 
edgment of the beanty of the universe, an ac- 
knowledgment the more sincere because it is not 
formal, but indirect; it is a task light and easy 
to him who looks at the world in the spirit of | 
love: further, it is an homage paid to the native 
and naked dignity of man, to the grand elemen- 
tary principle of pleasure, by which he knows, 
and feels, and lives, and moves. We have no 
sympathy but what is propagated by pleasure. 
I would not be misunderstood, but wherever we 
sympathize with pain it will be. found that the 
sympathy is produced and earried on by subtle 
combinations with pleasure.’ We have no knowl- 
edge, that is, no general principles drawn from 
the contemplation of particular facts, but what 
has been built up by pleasure, and exists in us 
by pleasure alone. The man of science, the 
chemist, and mathematician, whatever difficulties 
and disgusts they may have had to struggle with, 
know and feel this. However painful may be' 
the objects with which the anatomist’s knowledge 
is connected, he feels that his knowledge is pleas-.. 
ure; and where he ‘has no pleasure he has no 
knowledge. What then does the poet? He con- 
siders man and the objects that surround him as 
acting and reacting upon each other,.so as to 
produce an infinite complexity of pain and pleas- 
27
-P-A-G-E-37
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  ure; he considers man in his own nature and in 
his ordinary life as contemplating this with a 
certain quantity of immediate knowledge, with 
certain convictions, intuitions, and deductions, 
which by habit become of the nature of intui- 
tions; he considers him as looking upon this com- 
plex scene of ideas and sensations, and finding 
everywhere objects that immediately excite in 
him sympathies which, from the necessities of 
his nature, are accompanied by an overbalance of 
enjoyment. 
To this knowledge which all men carry about 
with them, and to these sympathies in which, 
without any other discipline than that of our 
daily life, we are fitted to take delight, the poet 
principally directs his attention. He considers 
man and nature as essentially adapted to each 
other, and the mind of man as naturally the mir- 
ror of the fairest-and most interesting qualities of 
nature. And thus the poet, prompted by this 
feeling of pleasure which accompanies him 
through the whole course of his studies, converses 
with general nature with affections akin to those 
which, through labor and length of time, the man 
of seience has raised up in himself, by conversing 
with those parts of nature which are the objects 
of his studies. The knowledge both of the poet 
and the man of science is pleasure; but the 
knowledge of the one cleaves to us as a necessary 
part of our existence, our natural and unalienable 
inheritance; the other isa personal and individ- 
ual acquisition, slow to come to us, and by no 
habitual and direct sympathy connecting us with 
our fellow beings. The man of science seeks 
truth as a remote and unknown benefactor; he 
28
-P-A-G-E-38
  WILLIAM WORDSWORTH   
cherishes and loves it in his solitude; the poet, 
singing a song in which all human beings join 
with him, rejoices in the presence of. truth as 
our visible friend and hourly companion. Poetry 
is the breath and finer spirit of ‘all knowledge; it 
is the impassioned expression whieh is in the 
countenance of all science. Emphatically may 
be said of the poet, as Shakespeare hath said of 
man, ‘‘that he looks before and after.’’? He is. 
the rock of defense of human nature, an upholder 
and preserver, carrying everywhere with him 
relationship and love. In spite of difference of 
soil and climate, of language and manners, of 
laws and customs, in spite of things silently gone 
out of mind, and things violently destroyed, the 
poet binds together by passion and knowledge 
the vast empire of human society, as it is spread 
over the whole earth and over all time. The 
objects of the poet’s thoughts. are everywhere; 
tho the eyes and senses of man are, it is true, his 
favorite guides, yet he will follow wheresoever 
he can find an atmosphere of sensation in which 
to move his wings. Poetry is the first and last 
of all knowledge—it is as immortal as the heart 
of man. 
If the labors of men of science should ever 
ereate any. material revolution, direct or in- 
direct, in our condition, and in the impressions 
which we habitually receive, the poet will sleep 
then no more than at present, but he will be 
ready to follow the steps of the man of science, 
not only in those general indirect effects, but he 
will be at his side, carrying sensation into the 
midst of the science itself. The remotest dis- 
eoveries of the chemist, the botanist, or mineral-

    ogist will be as proper objects of the poet’s art 
ag any upon which it can. be employed, if the time 
should ever come when these things shall be 
familiar to us, and the relations under which they 
are contemplated by the followers of these re- 
spective sciences shall be manifestly and palpa- 
bly material to us as enjoying and suffering be- 
ings. If the time should ever come when what 
is now called science, thus familiarized to men, 
shall be ready to put on, as it were, a form of 
flesh and blood, the poet will lend his divine spirit 
to aid the transfiguration, and will welcome the 
being thus produced as a dear and genuine in- 
mate of the household of man. It is not, then, 
to be supposed that any one, who holds that sub- 
lime notion of poetry which I have attempted to 
eonvey, will break in upon the sanctity and truth 
of his pictures by transitory and accidental orna- 
ments, and endeavor to excite admiration of him- 
self by arts, the necessity of which must mani- 
festly depend upon the assumed meanness of his 
subject.

Harpiy had Miss Ashton dropt' the pen, when 
the door of the apartment flew open, and the | 
Master of Ravenswood, entered the apartment. 
Lockhart and another domestie, who had in 
vain attempted to oppose his passage through the 
gallery or antechamber, were seen standing on 
the threshhold transfixt with surprize, which was 
instantly communicated to the whole party in 
the stateroom. That of Colonel Douglas Ashton 
was mingled with resentment; that of Bucklaw 
with haughty and affected indifference; the rest, 
even Lady Ashton herself, showed signs of fear; 
and Luey seemed stiffened to stone by this unex- 
pected apparition. Apparition it might well be

  termed, for Ravenswood had more the appearance 
of one returned from the dead than of a living 
visitor. 
He planted himself full in the middle of the 
apartment, opposite to the table at which Lucy 
was seated, on whom, as if she had been alone in 
the chamber, he bent his eyes with a mingled ex- 
pression of deep grief and deliberate indignation. 
His dark-colored riding cloak, displaced from one 
shoulder, hung around one side of his person in 
the ample folds of the Spanish mantle. The rest 
of his rich dress was travel-soiled, and deranged 
by hard riding. He had a sword by his side, and 
pistols in his belt. His slouched hat, which he had 
not yet removed at entrance, gave an additional 
gloom to his dark features, which, wasted by sor- 
row and marked by the ghastly look communi- 
cated by long illness, added to a countenance nat- 
urally somewhat stern and wild a fierce and even 
Savage expression, The matted and disheveled 
jocks of hair which escaped from under his hat, 
together with his fixt and unmoved posture, made 
his head more resemble that of a marble bust than 
that of a living man. He said not a single word, 
and there was a deep silence in the company for 
more than two minutes. 
Tt was broken by Lady Ashton, who in that 
space ‘partly recovered her natural audacity. She 
demanded to know the cause of his unauthorized 
intrusion.. 
“That is a question, madam,’’ said her son, 
‘‘which I have the best right to ask; and I must 
request of the Master of Ravenswood to follow 
me where he can answer it at leisure.’’

turning sternly toward them, and waving his 
hand as if to impose silence on their altercation.

one or both; at present, I have no leisure for the

sheathing his sword, while Bucklaw laid his hand 
on the hilt of that which Craigengelt had just 
reached him. 
Sir William Ashton, alarmed. for his son’s 
safety, rushed between the young men and 
Ravenswood, exelaiming, ‘‘My son, I command 
you—Buceklaw, I entreat you—keep the peace, in 
the name of the Queen and of the law!’” 
‘<In the name of the law of God,’’ said Brid-the- 
Bent, advancing also with uplifted hands between 
Bueklaw, the Colonel, and the object of their re- .. 
sentment—‘‘in the name of Him who brought 
peace on earth and good-will to mankind, I im- 
plore—I beseech—I command you to forbear 
violence. toward each other! God hateth the, 
bloodthirsty man; he who striketh with the sword

“more brutally stupid, to endure this insult in my 
father’s house? Let me go, Bucklaw! He shall 
account to me, or, by Heavens I will stab bim 
where he stands!’” 
“*You shall not touch him here,’’ said Bueklaw; 
‘‘he once gave me my life, and were the devil 
eome to fly away with the whole house and gen- 
eration, he shall have nothing but fair play.’’ 
The passions of the two young men thus count- 
eracting each other gave Ravenswood leisure to 
exclaim, in a stern and steady voice, ‘‘ Silence !— 
let him who really seeks danger take the fitting 
time when it is to be found; my mission here will 
be shortly accomplished. Is that your handwri- 
ting, madam?’’ he added in a softer tone, extend- 
ing toward Miss Ashton her last letter. 
A faltering ‘‘Yes,’’ seemed rather to escape 
from her lips than to be uttered as a voluntary 
answer. 
*‘And is this also your handwriting?’’ extend- 
ing toward her the mutual engagement. 
Luey remained silent. Terror, and a yet 
stronger and more eonfused feeling, so utterly 
disturbed her understanding that she probably 
seareely comprehended the question that was put 
to-her. 
‘<Tf you design,’’ said Sir William Ashton, ‘‘to 
found any legal claim on that paper, sir, do not 
expect to receive any answer to an extrajudicial 
question.’’

vengeance. This is my resolution, take it as you

said drawing his sword with the right hand, and, : 
with the left, by the same motion taking a pistol : 
from his belt and cocking it, but turning the point 
of one weapon and the mouzzle of the other to the 
ground—‘‘echoose if you will have this hal}

THE DEATH OF MEG MERRILES* 
THE surgeon arrived at the same time, and was. 
about to probe the wound ; but Meg resisted the

me speak what I have to say, and then. ye may

where’s Henry Bertram?’’ The assistants, to 
whom this name had been long a stranger, gazed 
upon each other. ‘‘Yes,’’ she said, in a stronger 
and harsher tone, ‘‘I said Henry Bertram of 
Ellangowan. Stand from the light and let me 
see him.’’ . 
All eyes were turned toward Bertram, who 
approached the wretched couch. The wounded 
woman took hold of his hand. ‘‘Look at him,’’ 
she said, ‘‘all that ever saw his father or his 
grandfather, and bear witness if he is not their 
living image?’’ .A- murmur went through the 
erowd—the resemblance was too striking to be 
denied, .“‘And now hear me—and let that man,’’ 
pointing to Hatteraick, who was seated with his 
keepers on a sea-chest at some distance—‘‘let 
him deny what I say, if he can. That is Henry 
Bertram, son to Godfrey Bertram, umquihile of 
Ellangowan; that young man is the very lad- 
bairn that Dirk Hatteraick carried off from 
Warroch wood the day that he murdered the 
gager. I was there like a wandering spirit—for 
T longed to see that wood or we left the country. 
I saved the bairn’s life, and sair, sair I prigged 
and prayed they would leave him wi’ me—but

other vow to myself, and if I lived to see the day 
_ of his return, I would set him in his father’s

  he’’ (pointing to Hatteraick), ‘‘will soon be 
another, and there will me ane mair yet.’’ 
The clergyman now interposing, remarked it 
was a pity this deposition was. not regularly 
taken and written down, and the surgeon urged 
the necessity of examining the wound, previously: 
to exhausting her by questions. When she saw 
them removing Hatteraick, in order to clear the 
room and leave the surgeon to his operations, 
she called out aloud, raising herself at the same 
time upon the couch, “Dirk Hatteraick, you and 
I will never meet again until we are before the 
judgment seat—will you own to what I have said, 
or will-you dare deny it?’’ He turned his hard- 
ened brow. upon her, with a look of dumb and in- 
fiexible defiance. ‘‘Dirk Hatteraick, dare ye deny, 
with my blood upon your hands, one word of what. 
my dying breath is uttering?’’ He looked at 
her with the same expression of hardihood and 
dogged stubbornness, and moved his lips, but 
uttered no sound. ‘‘Then fareweel!’’ she said, 
‘and God forgive you! your hand has sealed 
my evidence. When I was in life, I was the 
mad randy gipsy, that had been seourged, and 
banished, and branded—that had begged from 
door to door, and been hounded like a stray from. 
parish to parish—wha would hae minded her 
tale? But now I am a dying woman, and my 
words will not fall to the ground, any more than 
the earth will cover my blood!’’ : 
- She here paused, and all left the hut except 
the surgeon and two or three women. After.a: 
short examination, he shook his head, and re- 
signed his post by the dying woman’s side to the 
clergyman,

  A chaise returning empty to Kippletringan had 
been stopt on the high-road by a constable, who 
foresaw it would be necessary to convey Hatter- 
aick to jail. The driver, understanding what was 
going on at Derncleugh, left his horses to the 
eare of the blackguard hoy, confiding, it is to be 
supposed, rather in the years and diseretion of 
the cattle, than in those of their keeper, and set 
off full speed, to see, as he exprest himself, 
‘‘whaten a sort o’ fun was gaun on.’’ He arrived 
just as the group of tenants and peasants, whose 
numbers increased every moment, satiated with 
gazing upon the rugged features of Hatteraick, 
had turned their attention toward Bertram. 
Almost all of them, especially the aged men who 
had seen Ellengowan in his better days, felt and 
acknowledged the justice of Meg Merriles’s ap- 
peal. But the Scotch are a cautious people; they 
remembered there was another in possession of 
the estate, and they as yet. only exprest their 
feelings in low whispers to each other. Our 
friend, Jock Jabos, the postilion, forced his way 
into the middle of the.cirele; but no sooner cast 
his eyes upon Bertram, than he started back in 
amazement, with a solemn exclamation, ‘‘As sure 
as there’s breath in man, it’s auld Ellengowan.’’ 
This public declaration of an unprejudiced wit- 
ness was just the spark wanted to give fire to the 
popular feeling, which burst forth in three dis- 
tinet shouts: ‘‘Bertram forever!’’ ‘‘Long life 
to the heir of Ellangowan!’’ ‘‘God send him 
his ain, and to live among us as his forebears did 
of yore!’’ 
*“T hae been seventy years on the land,’’ said 
one person. boo 
33
-P-A-G-E-48
  SIR WALTER SCOTT   
“J and mine hae been seventy and seven to 
that,’’ said another; ‘‘I have a right to ken the 
glance of a Bertram.’ 
“T and mine hae been three hundred years 
here,’’ said another old man, ‘‘and I shall sell 
my last cow but I’ll see the young laird’ placed 
in his right.’’ 
The women, ever delighted with the marvelous, 
and not less so when a handsome young man is 
the subject of the tale, added their shrill acela- 
mations to the general all-hail. ‘‘Blessings on 
him—he’s the very picture 0’ his father! The 
Bertrams were ay the wale o’ the countryside!”’ 
‘Eh! that his puir mother, that died of grief 
and in doubt about him, had but lived to see this 
day!’’ exclaimed some female voices. 
“But we'll help him to his ain, kimmers,’’ cried 
others; ‘‘and before Gossin shall keep the Place 
of Ellangowan, we’ll howk him out o’t wi’ our 
nails!’? 
Others crowded around Dinmont, who was noth- 
ing loath to tell what he knew of his friend, and 
to boast the honor which he had in contributing 
to the discovery. As he was known to several of 
the principal farmers present, his testimony 
afforded an additional motive to the general en- 
thusiasm. In short, it was one of those moments 
of intense feeling, when the frost of the Scottish 
people melts like a snow-wreath, and the dissolv- 
ing torrent carries darn and dike before it. 
The sudden shouts interrupted the devotions of 
the clergyman; and Meg, who was in one of those 
dozing fits of stupefaction that precede the close 
of existence, suddenly started, ‘‘Dinna ye hear ?— 
dinna ye hear?—he’s owned!—he’s owned !—I

my. curse brought it down, my blessing has taen 
it off! And now I wad hae liked to hae said 
mair. But it can not be. Stay’’—she continued, 
stretched her head toward the gleam of light 
that shot through the narrow slit which served 
for a window—‘‘is he not there?—stand out 0” 
the light, and let me look upon him ance mair. 
But the darkness is in. my ain een,’’ she said, 
sinking back, after an earnest gaze upon vacuity 
—‘‘it’s a’ ended now. 
"Pass breath, 
Come death!’’ 
And, sinking back upon her couch of straw, she 
expired without a groan.

  painful to think that the fate of a being so 
amiable was involved in that of desperadoes of 
this man’s deseription; yet it seemed impossible 
to doubt it. Of what use, however, could this 
person be to my father’s affairs. I could think 
only of one. Rashleigh Osbaldistone had, at the 
instigation of Miss Vernon, certainly found means 
to produce Mr. Campbell when his presence was 
necessary to exculpate me from Morris’s-aceu- 
sation. Was it not possible that her influence, in 
like manner, might prevail on Campbell to pro- 
duce Rashleigh? Speaking on this supposition, 
I requested to know where my dangerous kinsman 
was, and when Mr. Campbell had seen him. The 
answer was indirect. 
‘It’s a kittle cast she has gien me to play; 
but yet it’s fair play, and I winna baulk her.

after a moment’s reflection; ‘‘he was a consid- 
erate man the deacon; he ken’d we'had a’ our 
frailties, and he lo’ed his friends. Ye’ll no hae 
forgotten him, Robin?’’ This question he put 
in a softened tone, conveying as much at. least 
of the ludicrous as the pathetic.

The jailer obeyed, and we all sallied forth. 
Stanchells looked with some surprize at the two 
strangers, wondering, doubtless, how they came 
into these premises without his knowledge; but 
Mr. Jarvie’s ‘‘Friends 0’ mine, Stanchells— 
friends 0’ mine,’’ silenced ali disposition to in- 
quiries. We now descended into the lower vesti- 
bule, and hallooed more than once for Dougal, 
to which summons no answer was returned; when 
Campbell observed, with a sardonic smile, ‘‘That 
if Dougal was the lad he kent him, he would 
scarce wait to get thanks for his ain share of the 
night’s wark, but was in all probability on the 
full trot.to the pass of Ballmaha’’— 
‘‘And left us—and, abune a’, me mysell, locked 
up in the tolbooth a’ night !’’ exclaimed the Bailie, 
in ire and perturbation. ‘‘Ca’ for fore-hammers, 
sledge-hammers, pinches, and coulters; send for 
Deacon Yettlin, the smith, and let him ken that 
Bailie Jarvie’s shut up in the tolbooth by a 
Hieland blackguard, whom he’ll hang up as high 
as Haman’’— 
‘When we catch him,’’ said Campbell gravely; 
‘‘but stay, the door is surely not locked.’’ 
Indeed, on examination, we found that the door 
was not only left open, but that Dougal in his 
retreat had, by carrying off the keys along with 
him, taken care that no one should exercise his 
office of porter in a hurry. 
“*He has glimmerings o’ common sense now, 
- that creature Dougal,’’ said Campbell; ‘‘he ken’d 
an open door might hae served me at a pinch.’’ 
We were by this time in the street.

“T tell you, Robin,’’ said the magistrate, ‘‘in

‘Ane o’ my kinsman a bailie in ilka burgh will 
just do as weel, Cousin Nicol.- So, gude-nicht 
or gude-morning to ye; and forget not the Clach- 
an of Aberfoil.”’ 
And without waiting for an answer, he sprang 
to the other side of the street, and was lost in 
darkness. Immediately on his disappearance, we 
heard him give a low whistle of peculiar modu- 
lation, which was instantly replied to. 
“Hear to the Hieland deevils,’? said Mr. 
Jarvie; ‘‘they think themselves on the skirts of 
Benlomond already, where they may gang whew- 
ing, whistling about without minding Sunday or 
Saturday.’’ Here he was interrupted by some 
thing which fell with a heavy clash on the street 
before us. ‘‘Gude guide us! what’s this mair

’ Bailie Grahame were to get word o’ this nicht’s 
job, it wad be a sair hair in my neck!’’ 
As we were still but a few steps from the 
tolbooth door, we carried back these implements ‘ 
of office, and consigned them to the head jailer, 
who, in lieu of the usual mode of making good. 
his post by turning the keys, was keeping sentry 
in the vestibule till the arrival of some assistant 
whom he had summoned in order to replace 
Celtic fugitive Dougal. .

burgh, and my road lying the same way with 
the honest magistrate’s, I profited by the light of 
his lantern, and he by my arm, to find our way 
through the streets, which, whatever they may 
now be, were then dark, uneven, and ill-paved. 
Age is easily propitiated by attentions from the 
young. The Bailie exprest himself interested in 
me, and added, ‘‘That since I was nane o’ that 
play-acting and play-ganging generation, whom 
his saul hated, he wad eat a reisted haddock, or 
a fresh herring, at breakfast wi’ him the morn, 
and meet my friend, Mr. Owen, whem, by that 
time, he would place at liberty.’’ 
‘(My dear sir,’’ said I, when I had accepted 
-of the invitation with thanks, ‘‘how could you 
possibly connect me with the stage?’’ 
“‘T watna,’’ replied Mr. Jarvie; ‘‘it was a

Tr chanced upon that memorable morning, that 
one of the earliest of the huntress train who ap- 
peared from her chamber in full array for the 
ehase was the princess for whom all these pleas- 
ures were instituted, England’s Maiden Queen. 
I know not if it were by chance, or out of the 
befitting courtesy due to a mistress by whom he 
was so much honored, that she had searcely made 
one step beyond the threshold of her chamber ere 
Leieester was by her side; and proposed to her, 
until the preparations for the chase had been 
completed, to view the pleasance, and the gardens 
which it connected with the castle-yard. . . . 
Horses in the meanwhile neighed, and champed 
the bits with impatience in the base-court; 
hounds yelled in their couples, and yeomen, 
rangers, and prickers lamented the exhaling of 
the dew, which would prevent the scent from 
lying. But Leicester had another chase in view: 
or, to speak more justly toward him, had become 
engaged in it without premeditation, as the high- 
spirited hunter which follows the ery of the 
hounds that hath crost his path by accident. The

  Queen—an accomplished and handsome woman, 
the pride of England, the hope of France and 
Holland, and the dread of Spain—had probably 
listened with more than usual favor to that mix- 
ture of romantic gallantry with which she always 
loved to be addrest, and the earl had, in vanity, in 
ambition, or in both, thrown in ‘more and more 
of that delicious ingredient, until his importunity 
became the language of Jove itself. 
‘No, Dudley,’’ said Elizabeth, yet it was with 
broken accents,—‘‘no, I must be the mother of 
my people. Other ties, that make the lowly 
maiden happy, are denied to her sovereign— 
No, Leicester, urge it no more—Were I as 
others, free to seek my own happiness—then, 
indeed—but it can not--can not be.—Delay the 
ehase—delay it for half an hour—and leave me, 
my lord.’’ 
‘‘How—leave you, madam!’’ said Leicester. 
‘*Has my madness offended you?’’ 
‘‘No, Leicester, not so!’’ answered the Queen

and retired with a slow and melancholy air. The. 
Queen stood gazing after him, and murmured to |. 
herself, ‘‘Were it possible—were it but possible! .- 
—But no—no—Elizabeth must be the wife and 
- mother of England alone.’’ . 
As she spoke thus, and in order to avoid some 
one whose step she heard approaching, the Queen 
turned into the grotto in which her hapless and 
yet but too successful rival lay concealed. 
The mind of England’s Elizabeth, if somewhat 
V4 49

“THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  shaken by the agitating interview to which she 
had just put a period, was of that firm and de- 
cided character which soon recovers its natural 
tone. It was like one of those ancient druidical 
monuments called rocking-stones. The finger of 
Cupid, boy as he is painted, could put her feel- 
ings in motion; but the power of Hercules could 
not have destroyed their equilibrium. As she 
advanced with a slow pace toward the inmost 
extremity of the grotto, her countenance, ere she 
had proceeded half the length, had recovered its 
dignity of look and her mien its air of command. 
It was then the Queen became aware that a 
female figure was placed beside, or rather partly 
behind, an alabaster column, at the foot of which 
arose the pellucid fountain which occupied the 
inmost recess of the twilight grotto. The classical 
mind of Elizabeth suggested the story of Numa 
and Egeria; and she doubted not that some 
Italian sculptor had here represented the Naiad 
whose. inspirations gave laws to Rome. As she 
advanced, she became doubtful whether she be- 
held. a. statue or form of flesh and blood. The 
unfortunate Amy, indeed, remained motionless 
betwixt the desire which she had to make her 
condition known to one of her own sex, and her 
awe for the stately form that approached her,— 
and which, tho her eyes had never before beheld, 
her fears instantly suspected to be the personage 
she really was. Amy had arisen from her seat 
with the purpose of addressing the lady, who 
entered the grotto alone, and as she at- first 
thought, so opportunely. But when she reeol- 
lected the alarm which Leicester had exprest at 
the Queen’s knowing aught of their union, and 
50

  became more and more satisfied. that the person 
whom she now beheld was Elizabeth, herself, she 
stood with one foot advanced and one withdrawn, 
her arms, head, and hands perfectly motionless, 
and her cheek as pallid as the alabaster pedestal 
against which she leaned. Her. dress was of a 
pale sea-green silk, little distinguished in that 
imperfect light, and somewhat resembled the 
drapery of a Grecian nymph,—such an antique 
disguise having been thought the most .secure 
where so many maskers and revelers were. as- 
sembied; so that the Queen’s doubt of her being 
a living form was justified by all contingent cir- 
cumstances, as well as by the bloodless cheek 
and fixt eye. 
From her dress, and the casket which she in- 
stinctively held in her hand, Elizabeth naturally 
conjectured that the beautiful, but mute figure 
which she beheld was a performer in one of the 
various theatrical pageants which had. been placed 
in different situations to surprize her with their 
homage; and that the poor player, overcome with 
awe at her presence, had either forgdt the part 
assigned her, or lacked courage to go through. it. 
It was natural and courteous to give her some 
encouragement; and Elizabeth accordingly said, 
in a tone of condescending kindness: ‘*How. 
now, fair nymph of this lovely grotto—art thou 
spellbound and struck with dumbness by the 
wicked enchanter whom men term Fear? We. . 
are his sworn enemy, maiden, and can reverse his. 
eharm. Speak, we command thee.’’ . 
Instead of answering her by speech, the un- 
fortunate countess dropt on her knee before the 
Queen, let her casket fall from her hand, and 
51
-P-A-G-E-61

  clasping her palms together, looked up in the 
Queen’s face with such a mixt agony of fear and 
supplication, that Elizabeth was considerably 
affected. 
‘‘What may this mean?”’ she said: ‘‘this. is a 
stronger passion than befits the oceasion. Stand 
up, damsel: what wouldst thou have with us?’’ 
“Your protection, madam,’’ faltered forth the 
unhappy petitioner. 
“Hach daughter of England has it while she 
is worthy, of it,’’ replied the Queen; ‘‘but your 
distress seems to have a deeper root than a for- 
gotten task. Why, and'in what, do you crave our 
protection ?’’ 
Amy hastily endeavored to recall what she were 
best to say, which might secure herself from the 
imminent dangers that surrounded her, without 
endangering her husband; and plunging from one 
thought to another, amidst the chaos which filled 
her mind, she could at length, in answer to the 
Queen’s repeated inquiries in what she sought. 
protection, only falter out, ‘‘ Alas! I know not.’’ 
‘‘This is folly, maiden,’’? said Elizabeth im- 
patiently; for there was something in the extreme 
eonfusion of the suppliant which irritated her 
curiosity as well as interested her feelings. ‘‘The 
sick man must tell his malady to the physician; 
nor are WE accustomed to ask questions so oft, 
without receiving an answer.’’ 
. “TI request—I implore—’’ stammered forth the 
unfortunate countess—‘I beseech your gracious 
protection—against—against one Varney.’’ She 
choked well-nigh as she uttered the fatal word, 
which was instantly caught up by the Queen. 
‘“‘What, “Varney—Sir Richard Varney—the

«<JJ—-was his prisoner—and he practised on 
my life—and I broke forth to—-to—”’ 
“<To throw thyself on my protection, doubt- 
less,’’ said Elizabeth. ‘Thou. shalt. have. it— 
that is, if thou art worthy; for, we will sift this 
matter to the uttermost.—Thou art,’’ she said, 
bending on the countess an eye which seemed de- 
signed to pierce her very inmost soul,—‘‘thou 
art Amy, daughter of Sir Hugh Robsart of Lid-~ 
eote Hall?’’ . i 
‘Forgive me—forgive me—most gracious 
princess!’’ said Amy, dropping once more on her 
knee from which she had arisen. 
‘¢For what should I forgive thee, silly wench?’’ . 
said Elizabeth: ‘‘for being the daughter of thine 
own father? Thou art brainsick, surely. Well, 
I see I must wring the story from thee by inches: 
Thou didst deceive thine old and honored father, 
—thy look confesses it; cheated Master Tres- 
silian,—thy blush avouches it; and married this 
same Varney.’’ : 
Amy sprung on her feet, and interrupted the 
Queen eagerly with—‘‘No, madam, no: as there 
is a God above us, I am not the sordid wretch 
you would make me! I am not the wife of that 
contemptible slave—of that most deliberate: 
villain! I am not the wife of Varney! I would 
rather be the bride of Destruction!’’ me 
The Queen, overwhelmed in her turn by Amy’s 
vehemence, stood silent for an instant, and then’ 
replied, ‘‘Why, God ha’ merey, woman! I see 
thou canst talk fast enough when the theme likes 
thee. Nay. tell me, woman,’’ she continued, for 
53
-P-A-G-E-63
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD'S CLASSICS 
  to the impulse of curiosity was now added that 
' of an undefined jealousy that some deception 
had been practised on her—‘tell me, woman,— 
for by God’s day, I witu know,—whose wife or 
whose paramour art thou? Speak out, and be 
speedy: thou wert better dally with a lioness 
an with Elizabeth.’’ , 
Urged to this extremity, dragged as it were by 
irresistible force to the verge of a precipice 
which she saw but could not avoid, permitted not 
a@ moment’s respite by the eager words and mena- 
cing gestures of the offended Queen,—Amy at 
length uttered i- despair, ‘‘The Earl of Leicester 
knows it all.’’ 
“‘The Earl of Leicester!’ said Elizabeth in 
utter -astonishment.—‘‘The Earl of Leicester!’’ 
she. repeated with kindling anger.—‘‘Woman, 
thou art set on to this—thou dost belie him—he 
takes no keep of such things as thou art. Thou 
art suborned to slander the noblest lord, and 
the truest-hearted gentleman, in England! But 
were he the right hand of our trust, or something 
yet dearer to us, thou shalt have thy hearing, 
_ and that in his presence. Come with me—come 
with me instantly!’’ 
As Amy shrunk back with terror, which the 
ineensed Queen interpreted as that of conscious 
guilt, Elizabeth rapidly advanced, seized on her 
arm, and hastened with swift and long steps out 
of the grotto and along the principal alley of 
the pleasance, dragging with her the terrified 
countess, whom she still held by the arm, and 
with utmost exertion could but just keep pace 
with those of the indignant Queen. 
Leicester was at this moment the center of a

  splendid group of lords and ladies assembled to- 
gether under an arcade, or portito, which closed 
the alley. The company had drawn together in 
that place, to attend the. commands of her 
Majesty when the hunting party should go for- 
ward: and their astonishment:may. be imagined, 
when, instead of seeing Elizabeth advanee toward 
them with her usual measured dignity. of motion, 
they beheld her walking go rapidly that she was 
in the midst of them ere they were aware; and.

astonished at the appearance of the pale, attenu- 
ated, half dead, yet still lovely female, whom the 
Queen upheld by main strength with one hand, 
while with the other she waved aside the ladies 
and nobles who prest toward her:under the idea, 
that she was taken suddenly ill—‘‘Where is my | 
Lord of Leicester?’’ she said, in a tone, that 
thrilled with astonishment all the: courtiers who | 
stood around.— ‘Stand forth, my Lord of

so suddenly presented itself. He had that: in-

    stant been receiving, with a political affectation 
of. disavowing and misunderstanding their mean- 
ing, the half uttered, half intimated congratula- 
tions of the courtiers upon the favor of the Queen 
carried apparently to its highest pitch during 
the interview of that morning; from which most 
of them seemed to augur that he might soon arise 
from their equal in rank to become their master. 
And now, while the subdued yet proud smile with 
which he disclaimed: those inferences was yet 
eurling his cheek, the Queen shot into the circle 
her passions excited to the uttermost; and sup- 
porting. with one hand, and apparently without 
an effort, the pale and sinking form of his almost 
expiring wife, and pointing with the finger of the 
other to her half-dead features, demanded in a 
voice that sounded to the ear of the astounded 
satesman like the last dread trumpet-all that is 
to summon body and spirit to the judgment-seat, 
‘*Knowest thou this woman?’’ 
As, at the blast of that last trumpet, the guilty 
‘shall call upon the mountains to cover them, Lei- 
eester’s inward thoughts invoked the stately arch 
which he had built in his pride, to burst its 
strong conjunction and overwhelm them in its 
ruins. But the cemented stones, architrave and 
pattlement, stood fast; and it was the proud 
master himself, who, as if some actual] pressure 
had bent him to the earth, kneeled down before 
Elizabeth, and prostrated his brow to the marble 
flagstones on whieh she stood. 
*Leicester,’’ said Elizabeth, in a voice which 
trembled with passion, ‘‘ could I think thou hast 
practised on me—on me thy sovereign—on me 
thy confiding, thy-too partial mistress, the base

  and ungrateful deception which thy present con- 
fusion surmises—by all that’is’ holy,.false lord, 
that head of thine were in as great: peril as ever 
was thy father’s!’ - 
Leicester Lad not conscious innocence, but he 
had pride, to support him. He raised slowly his 
brow and features, which were black and swollen 
with contending emotions, and only replied, “‘My 
head can not fall but by the sentence of my peers; 
to them I will plead, and not to. a. princess who. 
thus requites my faithful service.’’- 
‘cWhat! my lords,’’ said Hlizabeth, looking 
around, ‘‘we are defied, I think—defied in the 
castle we have ourselves bestowed on this proud 
man?'—My Lord Shrewsbury, you are marshal 
of England: attach him for high treason.’’ 
‘Whom does your Grace:'mean?’’ said 
Shrewsbury, much surprized,-~for he had that 
instant joimed the astonished. circle. . 
‘<Whom should I mean but that traitor Dudley, 
Earl of Leicester!—Cousin of Hunsdon, order - 
out your band of gentlemen pensioners, and take’. 
him ‘into custody.—I say, villain, make haste!’’ 
Hunsdon, a rough old noble, ‘who,.from his. 
relationship to the Boleyns, was accustomed to.” 
use more freedom with the Queen than almost any’ 
other dared to do, replied bluntly, ‘‘And it is 
like your Grace might order me to the Tower. a

beseech you to be patient.’’

‘¢name not the word to me: thou know’st not of 
what he is guilty!’’ 
“Amy, who had by this time in some degree 
recovered herself, and who saw her husband, as 
she conceived, in the utmost danger from the 
rage of an offended sovereign, instantly (and 
alas, how many women have done the same!) 
forgot her own wrongs and her own danger in 
her apprehensions for him; and throwing herself 
before the Queen, embraced her knees, while she 
exclaimed, ‘‘He is guiltless, madam, he is guilt- 
less—no one can lay aught to the charge of the 
noble Leicester.’’ 
‘¢Why, minion,’’ answered the Queen, ‘‘didst 
not thou thyself say that the Earl of Leicester 
was privy to thy whole history?’’ 
Did I say so?’’ repeated the unhappy Amy, 
Jaying aside every. consideration of consistency 
cand of self-interest: ‘‘oh, if I did, I foully belied 
him. May God so judge me, as I believe he was 
‘never privy to a thought that would harm me!’’ 
‘¢Woman!’’ said Elizabeth, ‘‘I will know who 
has moved thee to this; or my wrath—and the 
wrath of kings is a flaming fire—shall wither 
and consume thee like a weed in the furnace.’’ 
As the Queen uttered this threat, Leicester’s 
better angel called his pride to his aid, and re- 
proached him with the utter extremity of mean- 
ness which would overwhelm him forever, if he 
stooped to take shelter under the generous inter- 
‘position of his wife, and abandon her, in return 
for her kindness, to the resentment of the Queen. 
He had already raised his head, with the dignity 
of a man of honor, to avow his marriage and 
proclaim himself the protector of his countess,

alréeady,’’ answered the Queen. ‘‘My Lord Huns- 
don, look to this poor distrest young woman, and 
“let her be safely bestowed and in honest keeping, 
till we require her to be forthcoming.’’ 
Two or three of the ladies in attendance, either 
_ moved by compassion for a creature so inter- 
esting, or by some other motive, offered their 
service to look after her; but the Queen briefly 
answered, ‘‘Ladies, under favor, no. You have 
all (give God thanks) sharp ears and nimble 
tongues: our kinsman Hunsdon has ears of the 
dullest, and a tongue somewhat rough, but yet 
of the slowest. Hunsdon, look to it that none 
have speech of her.’’ 
““By our Lady!’’ said Hunsdon, taking in his 
strong sinewy arms the fading and almost swoon- 
ing form of Amy, ‘‘she is a lovely child; and 
tho a rough nurse, your Grace hath given her 
a kind one. She is safe with me as one of my 
own lady-birds of daughters.’’ 
: So saying, he carried her off, unresistingly and 
almost unconsciously; his war-worn locks and 
long gray beard mingling with her light-brown 
tresses, as her head reclined on his strong square 
shoulder. The Queen followed him with her eye. 
She. had already, with that self-command which 
forms so necessary a part of a sovereign’s accom- 
plishments, supprest every appearance of agita- 
tion, and seemed as if she desired to banish all 
traces of her burst of passion from the recollec- 
tion of those who had witnessed it. ‘(My Lord

effort, he subdued his emotion, while Elizabeth 
answered sharply, ‘You are something too hasty, - 
Master Varney: we will have first a report of 
the lady’s health and state of mind from Masters, 
our own physician, and then determine what shall 
be thought just. You shall have license, however, 
to see her, that if there be any matrimonial quar- 
rel betwixt you—such things we have heard do 
oceur, even betwixt a loving couple—you may 
make it up, without further scandal to our court 
or trouble to ourselves.’? ‘ 
Varney bowed low, and made no other answer, 
Elizabeth again looked toward Leicester, and 
said, with a degree of condescension which could 
only arise out of the most heartfelt interest, 
“Discord, as the Italian poet says, will find her 
way into peaceful convents, as well as into the 
privacy of families; and we fear our own guards 
and ushers will hardly exclude her from courts. 
My Lord of Leicester, you are’ offended with us, 
and we have right to be offended with you. We 
will take the lion’s part upon us, and be the first 
to forgive.’’ . 
Leicester smoothed his brow, as-if by an effort; 
but the trouble was too deep-seated that its 
placidity should at once return. He said, how-.. 
ever, that which fitted the occasion, that ‘‘he’ . 
eould not have the happiness of forgiving, be- 
cause she who commanded him to do'so could 
commit no injury toward him.’’ :

always availing itself of them: and in this sense 
Fortune may bé said to favor fools by those who, 
‘however prudent in their own opinion, are defi- 
cient in valor and enterprise. Again, an emi- 
nently good and wise man, for whom the praises 
of the judicious have procured a high reputation 
even with the.world at large, proposes to himself 
certain objects, and adapting the right means to 
the right end attains them; but his objects not 
being what the world calls Fortune, neither 
money nor artificial rank, his admitted inferiors 
in moral and intellectual worth, but more pros- 
perous in their worldly concerns, are said to 
have been favored by Fortune and be slighted; 
altho the fools did the same in their line as the 
wise man in his; they adapted the appropriate 
"means to the desired end, and so succeeded. In 
this sense the proverb is current by a misuse, or 
a catachresis at least of both the words, Fortune 
‘and Fools. 
How seldom, friend, a good great man inherits 
Honor or wealth with all his worth and pains!

If any man obtain that which he merits, 
Or‘any merit that which he obtains.

But, lastly, there is, doubtless, a true meaning 
attached to Fortune, distinct both from prudence 
and from courage; and distinct too from that 
absence of depressing or bewildering passions, 
which (according to my favorite proverb, ‘‘ex- 
tremes meet’’) the fool not seldom obtains in 
as great perfection by his ignorance as the wise 
man by the highest energies of thought and self- 
discipline. Luck has a real existence in human 
affairs, from the infinite number of-powers that 
are in action at the same time, and from the 
coexistence of things contingent and aceidental 
(such as to us at least are accidental) with the 
regular appearances and general laws of nature. 
A familiar instance will make these words in- 
telligible. The moon waxes and wanes according 
to a necessary law. The clouds likewise, and ail 
the manifold appearances gonnected with them, 
are governed by certain laws no less than the 
phases of the moon. But the laws which deter- .

those of the former are hidden from us. :

matter of accident. Well! at the time of the 
full moon, but when the sky is completely cov- 
ered with black clouds, I am walking on in the 
dark, aware of no particular danger; a sudden 
gust of wind rends the elouds for a moment, and 
the moon emerging discloses to me a chasm or 
precipice, to the very brink of which I had ad- 
vaneed my foot. This is what is meant by luek, 
and aceording to the more or less serious mood 
or habit of our mind, we exclaim, how lucky, or 
how providential!. The copresence of numberless 
phenomena, which from the complexity or sub- 
tlety of their determining causes are called con- 
tingencies, and the coexistence of these with any 
regular or necessary phenomenon (as the clouds 
with the moon, for instance) oceasion coinci- 
‘dences, which, when they are attended by any 
advantage or injury, and are at the same time 
ineapable of being calculated or foreseen by hu- 
“man prudence, form good or ill luck. On a hot 
sunshiny afternoon came on a sudden storm and 
spoiled the farmer’s hay; and this is called ill 
luck. We will suppose the same event to take 
place when meteorology shall have been perfeeted 
into a science, provided with unerring instru- 
ments; but which the farmer had neglected to 
examine. This is no longer ill luck, but im- 
prudence. 
‘Now apply this to our proverb. Unforeseen 
coincidences may have greatly helped a man, yet 
if they have done for him only what possibly 
from his own abilities he might have effected for 
his good luck will excite less attention

the intervention of skill or foresight; but we 
dwell on the fact and remember it, as something 
strange, when the same happens.to.a@ weak or 
ignorant man. So, too, tho the latter should fail 
in his undertakings from coneurrenees that might 
have happened to the wisest man, yet his failure 
being no more than might have been expected 
and aceounted for from his folly, it lays no hold 
on our attention, but fleets away among the other’ 
undistinguished waves, in which the stream of 
ordinary life murmurs by us and is forgotten. . 
Had it been as true as it was notoriously false,

themselves to Sir Humphry Davy exclusively in 
consequence of his luck in possessing a particular 
galvanic battery; if this battery, as far as Davy 
was concerned, had itself been an accident, and

have been talked of or deseribed as instances of 
luck, but as the natural results of his admitted 
genius and known skill. But should an accident 
have disclosed similar discoveries to a mechanic 
at Birmingham or Sheffield, and if the man should 
grow rich in consequence, and partly by the envy 
of his neighbors, and partly with good reason, be 
considered by them as a man below par in the 
general powers of his understanding; then, ‘‘Oh 
what a lucky fellow! Well, Fortune does favor 
fools—that’s certain! It is always so!’’—and 
forthwith the exclaimer relates half a dozen sim- 
ilar instances. Thus accumulating the one sort 
of facts and never collecting the other, we do, 
as poets in their diction and quacks of all denom-

the whole, and at once soothe our envy and

  not wish to see it realized? America would then 
be England viewed through a solar: microscope; 
Great Britain in a state of glorious magnification ! 
How deeply to be lamented is the spirit of hos- 
tility and sneering which some of the popular 
books of travels have shown in treating of the 
Americans! They hate us, no doubt, just ‘as 
brothers hate; but they respect the opinion. of 
an Englishman concerning themselves ten times 
as much as that of a native of any other country 
on earth. A very little humoring of their prej- 
udices, and some courtesy of language and de- 
meanor on the part of Englishmen, would work | 
wonders, even as it is, with the publie mind of 
the Americans. 
Capt. Basil Hall’s* book is certainly very en- 
tertaining and instructive; but, in my judgment, 
his sentiments upon many points, and more espe- 
cially his mode of expression, are unwise and 
uncharitable. After all, are not most of the 
things shown up with so much bitterness by him 
mere national foibles, parallels to which every 
people has and must of necessity have? 
What you say about the quarrel in the United 
States is sophistical, No doubt, taxation may, 
and perhaps in some cases must, press unequally, 
or apparently so, on different classes of people 
in a state. In such cases there is a hardship; 
but in the long run, the matter is fully com- 
pensated to the overtaxed class. For example, 
take the householders in London who complain 
so bitterly of the house and window taxes. Ig 
* Hall was a British naval officer, who visited the United 
States in 1827-28, and in 1829 published the book Oole-

  it not pretty clear that, whether such householder 
bea tradesman who indemnifies himself in the 
price of his goods; or a letter of lodgings who 
‘does so in his rent; or a stockholder who receives 
it back again in his dividends; or a country 
gentleman who has saved so much fresh levy on 
his land or his other property; one way or other, 
it comes at last pretty nearly to the same thing, 
tho the pressure for the time may be unjust and 
vexatious, and fit to be removed? But when New 
England, which may be considered a state in 
itself, taxes the admission of foreign manufac- 
tures in order to cherish manufactures of its 
own, and thereby forces the Carolinas, another 
_ State of itself, with which there is little inter- 
communion, which has no such desire or interest 
to serve, to buy worse articles at a higher price, 
it is altogether a different question, and is, in 
. faet, downright tyranny of the worst, because 
of the most sordid, kind. , What would you think 
of a law which should tax every person in Devon- 
shire for the pecuniary benefit of every person 
in Yorkshire? And yet that is a feeble image 
of the actual usurpation of the New England 
deputies over the property of the Southern 
States. 
There are two possible modes of unity in a 
state; one by absolute coordination of each to 
all, and of all to each; the other by subordination 
of classes and offices. Now, I maintain that there 
never was an instance of the first, nor can there 
be, without slavery as its condition and accom- 
paniment, as in Athens. The poor Swiss cantons 
are no exeeption. 
The mistake lies in confounding a state which 
8

must be based on classes and interests and un- 
equal property, with a church, which is founded 
on the person, and has no qualification but per- 
sonal merit. Such a community may exist, as 
in the case of the Quakers; but inorder to exist, 
it must be comprest and hedged, in by another 
society—mundus mundulus in mundo immundo. 
The free class in a slave state is always, in 
one sense, the most patriotic class of people in 
an empire; for their patriotism is not simply 
the patriotism of other people, but an aggregate... 
of lust of power and distinction and supremacy.

NELSON’S DEATH AT TRAFALGAR‘

Iv had been part of Nelson’s prayer, that the 
British fieet might be distinguished by humanity 
in the victory which he expected. Setting an 
example himself, he twice gave orders to cease 
firing on the Redoubtable, supposing that she had 
struck, because her guns were silent; for, as she 
earried no flag, there was no means ‘of instantly. 
ascertaining the fact. From this ship, which he 
had thus twice spared, he received his death. A 
ball fired from her mizzen-top, which, in the then 
situation of the two vessels, was not more than 
fifteen yards from that part of the deck where 
he was standing, struck the epaulet on his left 
shoulder, about a quarter after one, just in the 
heat of action. He fell upon his face, on the 
spot which was covered with his poor secretary’s 
blood. Hardy,’ who was a few steps from him,

‘They have done for me at last; Hardy,’’ said 
he. **I hope not,’? cried Hardy:.+‘Yes,’’ he 
replied; ‘‘my backbone is shot. thidugh.’’ Yet 
even now, not for a moment lositig' His presence 
of mind, he observed, as they weré.éarrying him 
down the ladder, that the tiller ropes, whieh had 
been shot away, were not yet replaced, and or- 
dered that new onés should be rove immediately: 
then, that he might not be seen by the erew, he 
took out his handkerchief, and covered his face, 
and his stars. Had he but concealed these badges... 
of honor from the enemy, England perhaps would —. 
not have had cause to receive with sorrow the 
news of the battle of Trafalgar. The cockpit was. 
erowded with wounded and dying men; over 
whose bodies he was with some difficulty con- 
veyed, and laid upon a pallet in the midshipmen's 
berth. It was soon perceived, upon examination, 
that the wound was mortal. This, however, was 
concealed from all except Captain’ Hardy, the 
chaplain, and the medical attendants, He. him- 
self being certain, from the sensation in his back,. 
and the gush of blood he felt momentarily within: 
his breast, that no human eare could avail him, . 
insisted that the surgeon should leave him, and. 
attend to those to whom he might be useful; 
‘“for,’’ said he, ‘‘you can do nothing for me.’’ °, 
All that could be done'was to fan him with ©

  '- sion of joy gleamed in the eyes, and marked the 
countenance of the dying hero. But he became 
impatient to see Hardy; and as that officer, tho 
often sent for, could not leave the deck, Nelson 
feared that some fatal cause prevented him, and 
repeatedly cried: ‘‘Will no one bring Hardy to 
me? he must be killed; he is surely dead!’? An 
hour and ten minutes elapsed from the time when 
Nelson received his wound before Hardy could 
come to him. ‘They shook hands in silence: 
Hardy in vain struggling to suppress the feelings 
of that most painful and yet sublimest moment. 
‘*¢Well, Hardy,’’ said Nelson, ‘‘how goes the day 
with-us?’’ ‘Very well,’’ replied Hardy; ‘‘ten 
ships-have struck, but five of the van have tacked, 
and. show an intention to bear down upon the 
_Vietory. I have called two or three of our fresh 
ships round, and have no doubt of giving them 
a drubbing.’’ ‘‘I hope,’’ said Nelson, ‘‘none of 
“our ships have struck?’’ Hardy answered, 
*¢There was no fear of that.’’ Then, and not till 
then, Nelson spoke of himself. ‘‘I am a dead 
map, Hardy,’’ said he; ‘‘I am going fast: it will 
be all over with me soon. Come nearer to me. 
Let my dear Lady Hamilton have my hair, and 
all other things belonging to me.’’ Hardy ob- 
‘served, that he hoped Mr. Beatty could yet hold 
out some prospect of life. ‘‘O no,’’ he replied; 
‘tit’ is impossible. My back is shot through. 
Beatty will tell you so.’’? Hardy then, once more, 
shook hands with him, and with a heart almost 
bursting, hastened upon deek, 
By. this time all feeling below the breast was 
geno; and Nelson, having made the surgeon ascer- 
tain this, said to him: ‘‘You know I am gone. 
82

rng ne, 
ROBERT SOQUTHEY a, 
I know it. I feel something rising in my breast,’? 
_ patting his hand on his left side, ‘which tells 
me so.’? And upon Beatty’s inquiring whether 
his pain was very great, he replied, ‘So great 
that he wished he was dead. Yet,’? said he, in 
a lower voice, ‘‘one would like to live a litile 
longer too!’? And after a few minutes, in. the 
same undertone, he added: ‘What would become 
of poor Lady Hamilton, if she knew my sitna- 
tion!?? Next to his country she occupied his | 
thoughts. Captain Hardy, some fifty minutes 
after he had left the cockpit, returned ; and, again. . 
taking the hand of his dying friend and com-. 
mander, congratulated him on having gained a — 
complete victory. How many of the enemy were 
taken he did not know, as it-was impossible to © 
perceive them distinctly; but, fourteen or fifteen 
at least. ‘‘That’s well,’’ cried Nelson; ‘‘but I 
bargained for twenty.’? And theti, in a stronger 
voice, he said: ‘‘Anchor,’ Hardy; anchor.’’ 
Hardy, upon this, hinted that. Admiral Colling- 
‘wood would take upon himself: thei direction of 
affairs. ‘‘Not while I. live, Hardy,’’ said the ~ 
dying Nelson, ineffectually endeavoring to raise 
himself from the bed: ‘‘do you anchor.”? His. 
previous orders for preparing. to anchor had 
shown clearly he foresaw the necessity of this. 
Presently, calling Hardy back, he said to bim, in’. 
a low voice, ‘‘Don’t throw: me overboard’’; and: 
he desired that he might be buried by his parents,. 
unless it should please: the King to: order other- 
wise. Then reverting to private feelings: ‘‘Take:’ 
care of my dear Lady Hamilton, Hardy: take °' 
care of poor Lady Hamilton.. Kiss me, Hardy,’? 
said he. Hardy knelt down and kissed his cheek; 
$3 
 
-P-A-G-E-91

and Nelson said, ‘‘Now I am satisfied. Thank 
God, I have done my duty!’’? Hardy stood over 
him in silence for a moment or two, then knelt . 
again and kissed his forehead. ‘‘Who is that?’’ 
said Nelson; and being informed, he replied, 
**God bless you, Hardy.’’ And Hardy then left 
him—forever. Nelson now desired to be turned 
upon his right side, and said, ‘‘I wish I had not 
left the deck; for I shall soon be gone.’’ Death 
was, indeed, rapidly approaching. He said to the 
chaplain, ‘‘Doctor, I have mot been a great 
sinner’’; and after a short pause, ‘‘ Remember 
that I leave Lady Hamilton and my daughter 
Horatia as a legacy to my country.’’ His ar- 
tieulation new became difficult; but he was dis- 
tinctly heard to say, ‘‘Thank God, I have done 
my duty!’’? These words he repeatedly pro- 
nounced; and they were the last words which he 
uttered. He expired at thirty minutes after four 
—three hours and a quarter after he had received 
his wound. 
The death of Nelson was felt in England as 
something more than a public calamity: men 
started at the intelligence, and turned pale, as 
if they had heard of the loss of a dear friend. 
An object of our admiration and affection, of 
our pride and of our hopes, was suddenly taken 
from us; and it seemed as if we had never till 
then known how deeply we loved and reverenced 
him. What the country had lost in its great 
naval hero—the greatest of our own and of all 
former: times—was scarcely taken into. the ac- 
count. of grief. So perfectly, indeed, had he per- 
formed his part, that the maritime war, after 
the battle of Trafalgar, was considered at an

a 
end. The fleets of the enemy were not merely 
defeated, but destroyed; new navies must be 
built, and a new race of seamen reared for them, 
before the possibility of their invading our shores 
could again be contemplated. It was not, there- 
fore, from any selfish reflection upon the magni- 
tude of our loss that we mourned for him: the 
general sorrow was of a higher character. “The 
people of England grieved that funeral. cere- 
monies, and public monuments, and posthumous 
rewards, were all which they could now bestow 
upon him whom the King, the legislature, and. 
the nation would have alike delighted to honor; 
whom every tongue would have blest; whose 
presence in every village through which he 
might have passed would have wakened the 
chureh-bells, have given schoolboys a holiday, 
have drawn children from their sports to gaze 
upon him, and ‘‘old_ men from’ the chimney- 
corner’? to look upon Nelson ere they died. The 
victory of Trafalgar was celebrated, indeed, with 
the usual forms of rejoicing, but they. were with- 
out joy; for such already was the glory of the 
British navy, through Nelson’s surpassing genius, 
that it searcely seemed to receive any addition 
from the most signal victory that ever. was 
achieved upon the seas; and the destruction. of 
this mighty fleet, by which all the maritime 
schemes of France were totally frustrated, hardly 
appeared to add to our security or strength; for 
while Nelson was living to watch the eombined. ” 
squadrons of the enemy, we felt ourselves. as 
secure as now, when they were no longer ‘in 
existence. . . vg lhe 
There was reason to suppose, from the ‘ap-

  pearances upon opening his body, that in the 
course of nature he might ‘have attained, like 
his father, to a good old age. Yet he can not 
be said to have fallen prematurely whose work 
was done; nor ought he to be lamented, who died 
so full of honors, and at the height of human 
fame. The most triumphant death is that of the 
martyr; the most awful, that of the martyred 
patriot; the most splendid, that of the hero in

horses of fire had been vouchsafed for Nelson’s 
translation, he could scarcely have departed in 
a brighter blaze of glory. He has left us, not 
indeed his mantle of inspiration, but a name and 
an example which are at this hour inspiring thou- 
sands of the youth of Engand—a name which is 
our pride and an example which will continue to 
be our shield and our strength. Thus it is that 
the spirits of the great and the wise continue to 
live and to act after them.

THE DEATH OF HOFER‘ 
: (1810) 
I passep two entire months in:Germany, and 
like the people. On my way I saw, Waterloo, an 
ugly table for an ugly game. At Innsbruck IT 
entered the church in which Andreas Hofer is 
buried. He lies under a plain slab,.on the left, 
near the door. I admired the. magnificent tomb 
of bronze, in the center, surmounted by: heroes, :. 
real and imaginary. They did not fight, tens — 
against thousands; they did not fight for wives: 
and children, but for lands and plunder; there-:. 
fore they are heroes! My admiration for these 
works of art was soon satisfied, which perhaps 
it would not have been in any other place. Snow, 
      
      
Hofer had led the Tyrolese insurrection against Napa 
Jeon’s government in 1809, gaining victories at mo

  mixt with rain, was falling, and was blown by 
the wind upon the tomb of Hofer. I thought how 
often he had taken advantage of such weather 
for his attacks against the enemies of his country, 
and I seemed to hear his whistle in the wind. At 
the little village of Landro (I feel a whimsical 
satisfaction in the iikeness of the name to mine), 
the innkeeper was the friend of this truly great 
man—the greatest man that Europe has produced 
in our days, excepting his true compeer, Kos- 
eiusko. Andreas Hofer gave him the chain and 
crucifix he wore three days before his death. 
You may imagine this man’s enthusiasm, who, 
because I had said that Hofer was greater than 
king or emperor, and had made him a present 
of small value, as the companion and friend of 
that harmless and irreproachable hero, took this 
precious relic from his neck and offered it to me. 
By the order of Bonaparte, the companions of 
Hofer, eighty in number, were chained, thumb- 
serewed, and taken out of prison in couples, to 
see him shot. He had about him one thousand 
florins, in paper currency, which he delivered 
to his confessor, requesting him to divide it im- 
partially among: his unfortunate ¢countrymen. 
The confessor, an Italian who spoke German, 
kept it, and never gave relief from it to any 
of them, most of whom were suffering, not only 
from privation of wholesome air, to which, among 
other privations, they never had been accustomed, 
but also from scantiness of nourishment and 
clothing. Even in Mantua, where, as in the rest 
of Italy, sympathy is both weak and silent, the 
lowest of the people were indignant at the sight 
of so brave a defender of his country led into

for many eenturies in their nation. When they 
saw him walk forth, with unaltered countenance 
and firm step before them; when, stopping on 
the ground which was about to receive his blood, 
they heard him with unfaltering voiee commend 
his soul and his country to the Creator; and, as 
if still under his own roof (a custom with him 
after the evening prayer), implore a blessing for 
his boys and his little daughter, and for the 
mother who had reared them up carefully and 
tenderly thus far through the perils of child-— 
hood; finally, when in a lower tone, but earnestly 
and emphatically, he besought pardon from the 
Fount of Mercy for her brother, his betrayer, 
many smote their breasts aloud; many, thinking 
that sorrow.was shameful, lowered their heads 
and wept; many, knowing that it. was dangerous, . 
yet wept too. The people remained upon the 
spot an unusual time, and the French, fearing 
some commotion, pretended to have received an 
order from Bonaparte for the mitigation of the 
sentence, and publicly announced it. 
Among his many falsehoods, any one of which 
would have excluded him forever from the society 
of men of honor, this is perhaps the basest; as 
indeed of all his atrocities the. death of Hofer, 
which he had ordered long before, and appointed ’

brave and virtuous will reprobate the most 
severely. He was urged by neo necessity, he was 
prompted by no policy; his impatience of courage 
in an enemy, his hatred of patriotism and integ-

saw no image in those about him, ontstript his

_ but power and celebrity. 
The name of Andreas Hofer will be honored 
by posterity far above any of the present age, 
‘and together with the most glorious of the last, 
Washington and Koseiusko. For it rests on the 
same foundation, and indeed on a higher basis. 
In virtue and wisdom their ecoequal, he van- 
quished on several occasions a force greatly supe- 
rior to his own in numbers and in discipline, by 
the courage and confidence he inspired, and by 
his brotherly care and anxiety for those who 
were fighting at his side.. Differently, far dif- 
ferently, ought we to estimate the squanderers 
of human blood, and the seorners of human tears. 
We also may boast of our great men in a cause 
as great; for without it they could not be so. 
We may look back upon our Blake; whom the 
prodigies of a Nelson do not eclipse, nor would 
‘he. have wished (such was his generosity) to 
obscure it. Blake was among the founders of 
freedom; Nelson was the vanquisher of its’ de- 
stroyers. Washington was both; Kosciusko was 
neither; neither was Hofer. But the aim of all 
three was alike; and in the armory of God are

NAPOLEON AND PERICLES 
Two powerful nations have been. vitally af- 
feeted by natural calamities. The former of 
these calamities was inevitable by human pra- 
dence, and uncontrollable by human skill; the 
latter was to be foreseen at any distance by 
the most ignorant, and to be avoided by the 
most unwary. I mean in the first the Plague 
of the Athenians; in the second the starvation 
of the French. The first happened under the 
administration of a man transcendently brave; 
a man cautious, temperate, eloquent, prompt, 
sagacious, above all that ever guided the coun- 
cils and animated the energies of a state; the 
second under a soldier of fortune, expert and 
enthusiastic; but often deficient in moral courage, 
not seldom in personal; rude,’ insolent, rash, 
rapacious; valuing but one. human life among 
the myriads at his disposal, and that one far 
from the worthiest, in the estimation of an hon- 
ester and a saner mind. . 
It is with reluctant shame I enter on a com- 
parison of such a person and Pericles. On one 
hand we behold the richest cultivation of ‘the 
most varied and extensive genius; the confidence 
of courage, the sedateness of wisdom, the stateli- 
ness of integrity; on the other, coarse manners, 
rude language, violent passions continually ex- 
ploding, a bottomless void on the side of truth, 
and a rueful waste on that of common hon-

oe - So many pernicious faults were 
not committed by Xerxes or Darius, whom an- 
cient historians call feeble princes, as were com- 
mitted by Napoleon, whom the modern do not 
call feeble, because he felt nothing for others, 
‘ eoerced pertinaciously, promised rashly, gave in- 
discriminately, looked tranquilly, and spoke mys- 
' teriously. Even in his flight, signalized by noth- 
ing but despondency, Segur, his panegyrist, hath 
clearly shown that, had he retained any presence 
of mind, any sympathy, or any shame, he might 
have checked and crippled his adversary. One 
glory he shares with Trajan and with Pericles, and 
neither time nor malice can diminish it. He 
raised up and rewarded all kinds of merit, even 
in those arts to which he was a stranger. In 
this indeed he is more remarkable, perhaps more 
admirable, than Pericles himself, for Pericles was 
a stranger to none of them.

  with from the ballad of the Children in the Wood. 
Certain it is that the whole story of the children 
and their cruel uncle was to be seen fairly carved 
out in wood upon the chimney-piece of the great 
hail, the whole story down to the Robin Red- 
breasts, till a foolish rich uncle pulled it down 
to set up a marble one of modern invention in 
its stead, with no story upon it. Here Alice put 
out one of her dear mother’s looks, too tender to 
be called upbraiding. 
*. Then I went on to say how religious and how 
good their great-grandmother Field was, how 
beloved and respected by everybody, tho she was 
not indeed the mistress of this great house, but 
had‘only the charge of it—and yet in some re- 
spects she might be said to be the mistress of 
it too—committed to her by the owner, who pre- 
ferred living in a newer and more fashionable 
mansion which he had purchased somewhere in 
the adjoining county; but still she lived in it 
in a manner as if it had been her own, and kept 
up the dignity of the great house in a sort while 
she lived, which afterward came to decay, and 
was nearly pulled down, and all its old orna- 
ments stript and carried away to the owner’s 
other house, where they were set up, and looked 
as awkward as if some one were to carry away 
the old tombs they had seen lately at the Abbey, 
and stick them up in Lady C.’s tawdry gilt 
drawing-room. Here John smiled, as much as 
to say, ‘‘That would be foolish indeed.’’ . And 
then I told how, when she came to die, her 
funeral was attended by a concourse of all the 
poor, and some of the gentry too, of the neigh- 
borhood for many miles round, to show their 
94

  respect for her memory, because she had been 
such a good and religious woman; so good, indeed, 
that she knew all the Psaltery by heart, ay, and 
a great part of the Testament besides. Here 
little Alice spread her hands. 
Then I told what a tall, upright, graceful per- 
son their great-grandmother Field once was; an 
how in her youth she was esteemed the best 
dancer. Here Alice’s little right foot played an 
involuntary movement, till, upon my looking 
grave, it desisted—the best dancer, I was saying, 
in the county, till a eruel disease, called a cancer, 
came, and bowed her down with pain; but it 
could never bend her good spirits, or make them 
stoop, but they were still upright, because she 
was so good and religious. Then I told how she 
was used to sleep by herself in a lone chamber 
of the great lone house; and how she believed 
that an apparition of two infants was to be seen 
at midnight gliding up and down the great stair- 
ease near where she slept; but she said ‘‘those 
innocents would do her no harm’?; and how 
frightened I used to be, tho in those days I had 
my maid to sleep with me, because.I was never 
half so good or religious as she—and yet I never 
saw the infants. Here John expanded all his 
eyebrows, and tried to look courageous. : 
Then I told how good she was to all her grand- 
children, having us to the great house in the 
holidays, where I, in particular, used to spend | 
many hours by myself in gazing upon the old busts 
of the twelve Caesars that had been emperors 
of Rome, till the old marble heads would seen

  roaming about that huge mansion, with its vast 
empty rooms, with their worn-out hangings, flut- 
tering tapestry, and carved oaken panels, with 
the gilding almost rubbed out—sometimes in the 
spacious old-fashioned gardens, which I had al- 
most to myself, unless when now and then a 
solitary gardening man would cross me—and how 
the nectarines and peaches hung upon the walls, 
without my ever offering to pluck them, because 
they were forbidden fruit, unless now and then, 
and because I had more pleasure in strolling 
about among the old melancholy-looking yew- 
trees, or the firs, and picking up the red berries 
and the fir apples, which were good for nothing 
but to look at; or in lying about upon the fresh 
grass, with all the fine garden smells around 
me; or basking in the orangery, till I could almost 
fancy myself ripening, too, along with the or- 
anges and the limes, in that grateful warmth; 
or in watching the dace that darted to and fro 
in the fish-pond at the bottom of the garden, with 
here and there a great sulky pike hanging mid- 
way down the water in silent state, as if it 
mocked at their impertinent friskings. I had 
more pleasure in these busy-idle diversions than 
in all the sweet flavors of peaches, nectarines, 
oranges, and such like common baits of children. 
Here John slyly deposited back upon the plate 
a bunch of grapes, which, not unobserved by 
Alice, he had meditated dividing with her, and 
both seemed willing to relinquish them for the 
present as irrelevant. Then, in somewhat a more 
heightened tone, I told how, tho their great- 
andmother Field ‘loved all her grandchildren, 
yet in an especial manner she might be said to

handsome and spirited a youth, and a king to 
the rest of us; and, instead ef moping about in 
solitary corners, like some of us, he would mount. 
the most mettlesome horse he. could get, when 
but an imp no bigger than themselves, and make 
it carry him half over the county in a morning, 
and join the hunters when there were any. out; 
and yet he loved the old great house and gardens 
too, but had too much spirit to be always pent 
up within their boundaries; and how their uncle 
grew up to man’s estate as brave as he was — 
handsome, to the admiration of everybody, but: 
of the great-grandmother Field most especially; 
and how he use” “+ carry me upon his back when 
I was a lame-:-c.:d boy—for he was a good bit 
older than me--aany a mile when I eould not | 
walk for pain; and how, in after-life, he became 
lame-footed too, and I did not always, I fear, 
make allowances enough for him when he was 
impatient and in pain, nor remember sufficiently 
how considerate he had been to me when I was 
lame-footed; and how, when he died, tho he had 
not been dead an hour, it seemed as if he had 
died a great while ago, such a distance there 
is betwixt life and death; and how I bore his 
death, as I thought, pretty well at ‘first, but 
afterward it haunted and haunted me; and. tho 
I did not ery or take it to heart as some do, and’ 
  as I think he would have done if I had died, yet. '. 
I missed him all day long, and knew not till then

  —rather than not have him again; and was as 
uneasy without him, as he, their poor uncle, must 
have been when the doctor took off his limb. 
Here the children fell a-erying, and asked if 
their little mourning which they had on was not 
for Unele John; and they looked up and prayed 
me not to go on about their unele, ‘but to tell 
them some stories about their pretty dead mother. 
Then I told how, for seven long years, in hope 
sometimes, sometimes in despair, yet persisting 
ever, I courted the fair Alice W—n; and, as 
much as children could understand, I explained 
to them what coyness, and difficulty, and denial 
meant in. maidens; when suddenly turning to 
Alice, the soul of the first Alice looked out at 
her eyes with such a reality of representment, 
that I became in doubt which of them stood there 
before me, or whose that bright hair was; and 
while I stood gazing, both the children gradually 
grew fainter to my view, receding, and still re- 
ceding, till nothing at last but two mournful fea- 
tures were seen in the uttermost distance, which, 
without speech, strangely imprest upon me the 
effects of speech: ‘‘We are not of Alice, nor of 
thee; nor are we children at all, The children 
of Alice call Bartrum father. We are nothing, 
less than nothing, and dreams. We are only 
what might have been, and must wait upon the 
tedious shores of Lethe millions of ages before 
we have existence and a name’’; and immediately 
awaking, I found myself quietly seated in my 
bachelor arm-chair, where I had fallen asleep, 
with the faithful Bridget unchanged by my side 
—but John L. (or James Elia) was gone forever.

and the labor of an hour or. two, at any time, 
as for the loss of the pigs. While he was thinking 
what he should say to his father, and wringing 
his hands over the smoking remnants of one of 
those untimely sufferers, an odor assailed his 
nostrils, unlike any scent which he had before 
experienced. What. could it proceed from ?—not 
from the burned cottage—he had smelt that smell 
pbefore—indeed this was by no means the fitst 
accident of the kind which had occurred through 
the negligenee of this unlucky young firebrand. 
Much less did it resemble that of any known herb, 
weed or flower. A premonitory moistening at the 
same time overflowed his nether lip. He knew 
not what to think. He next stooped down to 
feel the pig, if there were any signs of life in

  it. “He burned his fingers, and to cool them he 
applied them in his booby fashion to his mouth, 
Some of the erumbs of the scorched skin had 
ome away with his fingers, and for the first time 
in his. life (in the world’s life, indeed, for before 
him no man had known it) he tasted—crackling! 
Again he felt and fumbled at the pig. It did 
not burn him so much now, still he licked his 
fingers from a sort of habit. 
The truth at length broke into his slow under- 
standing that it was the pig that smelt so, and 
the pig that tasted so delicious; and surrendering 
himself up to the new-born pleasure, he fell to 
tearing up whole handfuls of the scorched skin 
with the flesh next it, and was cramming it down 
his throat in his beastly fashion, when his sire en- 
tered amid the smoking rafters, armed with retrib- 
utory cudgel, and finding how affairs stood, began 
+* rain blows upon the young rogue’s shoulders, as 
thick as hail stones, which Bo-bo heeded not any 
more than if they had been flies. The tickling 
pleasure which he experienced in his lower re- 
gions had rendered him quite callous to any in- 
conveniences he might feel in those remote quar- 
ters. His father might lay on, but he could not 
beat him from his pig, till he had fairly made 
an end of it, when, becoming a little more sen- 
sible of his situation, something like the following 
dialog ensued. 
“¢You graceless whelp, what have you got there 
devouring? Is it not enough that you have 
burned me down three houses with your dog’s 
tricks, and be hanged to you! but you must be 
eating fire, and I know not what—what have 
you got there, I say?’’

  “O father, the pig, the pig! do.come and taste 
how nice the burned pig eats.’’ ee 
The ears of Ho-ti tingled: with horror. He 
eurst his son, and he curst himself that ever 
he should beget a son that should eat burned pig. 
Bo-bo, whose scent was wonderfully sharpened 
since morning, soon raked out another. pig, and 
fairly rending it asunder, thrust the lesser half 
by main force into the fists of Ho-ti, still shouting 
out, ‘‘Eat, eat, eat the burned pig, father, only 
taste—O Lord’’—with such like barbarous ejae- 
ulations, cramming all the while as if he would 
choke. : 
Ho-ti trembled in every joint while he grasped 
the abominable thing, wavering whether he should 
not put his son to death for an unnatural young 
monster, when the crackling scorching his fingers, 
as it had done his son’s, and applying the same. 
remedy to them, he in his turn tasted some of 
its flavor, which, make what sour mouths he 
would for pretense, proved not altogether dis- 
pleasing to him. In conclusion (for the manu- 
seript here is a little tedious) both father and 
son fairly sat down to the mess, and never left 
off till they had dispatched all that remained 
of the litter. 
Bo-bo was strictly enjoined not to let the secret 
escape, for the neighbors would certainly have 
stoned them for a couple of abominable wretches, 
who could think of improving upon the good 
meat which God had sent them. Nevertheless 
strange stories got about. It was observed that 
Ho-ti’s eottage was burned down now more fre- 
quently than ever. Nothing but fires from this 
time forward. Some would break out in broad

    day, others in the night-time. As often as the 
sow farrowed, so sure was the house of Ho-ti 
_ to be in a blaze; and Ho-ti himself, which was 
the more remarkable, instead of chastising his 
son, seemed to grow more indulgent to him than 
ever. At length they were watched, the terrible 
mystery discovered, and father and son sum- 
moned to take their trial at Peking, then an in- 
considerable assize town. Evidence was given, 
the obnoxious food itself produced in court, and 
verdict about to be pronouneed, when the fore- 
man of the jury begged that some of the burned 
pig, of which the culprits stood aceused, might 
be handed into the box.. He handled it, and they 
all handled it; and burning their fingers, as Bo-bo 
and his father had done before them, and nature 
prompting each of them the same remedy, against 
the faces of all the facts, and the clearest charge 
which judge had ever given—to the surprize of 
-the whole court, townsfolk, strangers, reporters, 
and all present—without leaving the box, or any 
manner of consultation whatever, they brought 
in a simultaneous verdiet of Not Guilty. 
The judge, who was a shrewd fellow, winked 
at the manifest iniquity of the decision; and 
when the court was dismissed, went privily, and 
bought up all the pigs that could be had for love 
or money. In a few days his lordship’s town- 
house was observed to be on fire. The thing took 
wing, and now there was nothing to be seen but 
fire in every direction. Fuel and pigs grew enor- 
mously dear allover the district. The insurance 
offices one and all shut up shop. People built

gentleman—that has nd orchestra business to call 
him from his warm bed-to such preposterous ex- 
” ereise—we take ten, or half after ten (eleven, of 
’gourse, during this Christmas solstice), to be the 
--yery earliest hour at which he can begin to think 
‘of abandoning his pillow. To think of it, we say; 
for to do it in earnest requires another half hour’s 
good consideration. Not but there are pretty sun- 
risings, as we are told, and such like gauds abroad 
in the world in summer-time especially, some hours 
before what we have assigned, which a gentle- 
man may see, as they say, only for getting up. 
But having been tempted once or twice, in earlier 
life, to assist at those ceremonies, we confess our 
. euriosity abated. We are no longer ambitious of 
being the sun’s courtiers, to attend at his morn- 
ing levees. We hold the good hours of the dawn 
_ too saered to waste them upon such observances; 
‘which have in them, besides, something pagan 
and Persic. To say truth, we never anticipated 
our, usual hour, or got up with the sun (as ’tis 
ealled), to go a journey, or upon a foolish whole 
day’s pleasuring, but we suffered for it all the 
Jong hours after in listlessness and headaches; 
Nature herself sufficiently declaring her sense of 
our presumption in aspiring to regulate our frail 
waking courses by the measures of that celestial 
and’ sleepless: traveler. We deny not that there 
is something sprightly. and vigorous, at the out- 
set especially,.in these break-of-day exeursions. 
It is flattering to get the start of a lazy world, 
to conquer death by proxy in his imagé. But the 
seeds of sleep and mortality are in us; and we 
pay usually, in strange qualms before night falls, 
the penalty of the unnatural inversion.

  CHARLES LAMB 
  Therefore, while the busy part of mankind are 
fast huddling on their clothes, or are already 
up and about their occupations, content to have 
swallowed their sleep by wholesale, we choose 
to linger abed, and digest our dreams. It is the 
very time to recombine the wandering images 
which ‘night in a confused mass. presented; to 
snatch them from forgetfulness; to shape and 
mold them. Some people have no good of their 
dreams. Like fast feeders, they gulp them too 
grossly to taste them curiously. We love to chew 
the cud of a foregone vision; to collect the scat- 
tered rays of a brighter phantasm, or act over 
again, with firmer nerves, the sadder nocturnal 
tragedies; to drag into daylight a struggling and 
half-vanishing nightmare; to handle and examine 
the terrors or the airy solaces. We have too 
much respect for these spiritual communications 
to let them go so lighty. We are not so stupid 
or so careless as that imperial forgetter of his 
dreams, that we should need a seer to remind us 
of the form of them. They seem to us to have as 
much significance as our waking. concerns; or 
rather to import us more nearly, as more nearly 
we approach by years to the shadowy world 
whither we are hastening. We have shaken hands 
with the world’s business; we have done with it; 
we have discharged ourselves of it. 
Why should we get up? We have neither suit 
to solicit, nor affairs to manage. The drama has 
shut in upon us at the fourth act. We have 
nothing here to expect but in a short time a sick- 
bed and a dismissal. We delight to anticipate 
death by such shadows as night affords. We are 
already half acquainted with ghosts. We, were 
109

never much in the world. Disappointment early 
struck a dark veil between us and its dazzling 
illusions. Our spirits showed gray before our 
-hairs. The mighty changes of the world already 
. appear as but the vain stuff out of which dramas 
are composed. We have asked no more of life 
than what the mimic images in playhouses pre- 
sent us with. Even those types have waxed 
fainter. Our clock appears to have struck. We 
are superannuated. In this dearth of mundane 
satisfaction, we contract politic alliances with 
shadows. It is good to have friends at court. 
The abstracted media of dreams seem no ill in- 
troduction to that spiritual presence, upon which, 
in no long time, we expect to be thrown. We are 
trying to know a little of the usages of that 
colony; to learn the language, and the faces we 
shall meet with there, that we may be the less 
awkward at our first coming among them. We 
willingly call a fantom our fellow, as knowing 
we shall soon be of their dark companionship. 
Therefore we cherish dreams. We try to spell in 
them the alphabet of the invisible world, and 
think we know already how it shall be with us. 
Those uncouth shapes, which, while we clung to 
flesh and blood, affrighied us, have become famil- 
iar. We feel attached into their meager 
essenees, and have given the hand of half-way 
approach to incorporeal being. We once thought 
life to be something, but it has unaccountably 
fallen. from.us before its time. Therefore we 
choose to dally. with visions. The sun has no 
purposes of ours to light us to. Why should we 
get up?

HAMLET* 
Ir is the one of Shakespeare’s plays that we 
think of the oftenest, because it sounds most in 
striking reflections on human life, and because 
the distresses of Hamlet are transferred, by 
the turn of his mind, to the general account of 
humanity. Whatever happens to him, we apply 
to ourselves, because he applies it to ‘himself as 
a means of general reasoning. He is a great 
moralizer; and what makes him worth attending 
to is that he moralizes on his own feelings and 
experience. He is not a commonplace pedant. 
If Lear is distinguished by the greatest depth of 
passion, Hamlet is the most remarkable for the 
ingenuity, originality, and unstudied development 
of character. Shakespeare had more magnanimity 
than any other poet, and he has shown more of 
it in this play than in any other. There is no 
attempt to force an interest: everything is left 
for time and cireumstances to unfold. The at- 
tention is excited without effort; the incidents 
sneceed each other as matters of course; the

    -eharacters think, and speak, and act just as they 
‘might do if left entirely to themselves. There 
is no set purpose, no straining at a point. The 
observations are suggested by the passing seene— 
:the gusts of passion come-and go like sounds of 
.«mausie borne on the wind. The whole play is an 
exact transcript of what might be supposed to 
have taken place at the court of Denmark at the 
remote period of time fixt upon, before the mod- 
ern refinements in morals and manners were 
heard of. It would have been interesting enough 
to have been admitted as a bystander in such a 
seene, at such a time, to have heard and witnessed 
something of what was going on. But here we 
are more than spectators. We have not only ‘‘the 
_ outward pageants and the signs of grief,’’ but 
‘*we have that within which passes show.’’ We 
read the thoughts of the heart, wc catch the pas- 
sions living as they rise. Other dramatie writers 
give us very fine versions and paraphrases of 
nature; but Shakespeare, together with his own 
comments, gives us the original text, that we may 
judge for, ourselves. This is a very great advan- 
tage: . 
The character of Hamlet stands quite by itself. 
It is not a character marked by strength of will 
or even of passion, but by refinement of thought 
and sentiment. Hamlet is as little of the hero 
as a man can well be; but he is a young and 
princely novice, full of high enthusiasm and quick 
sensibility—the sport of circumstances, question- 
ing with fortune, and refining on his own feelings, 
and forced from the natural bias of his disposi- 
tion by the strangeness of his situation. He seems 
incapable of deliberate action, and is only. hurried 
112
-P-A-G-E-120
  WILLIAM HAZLITT.. . 
  into extremities on the spur of the oceasion, when. 
he has no time to reflect—as in. the scene where 
he kills Polonius; and, again, where. he alters the 
letters which Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are 
taking with them to England, purporting his 
death. At other times, when he is.most bound to 
aet, he remains puzzled, undecided, and skeptical ; 
dallies with his purposes till the oceasion is. lost, 
and finds out some pretense to relapse into indo- 
lence and thoughtfulness again. For this reason 
he refuses to kill the king. when he is at his: | 
prayers; and, by a refinement-in malice, which , 
is in truth only an excuse for his own want of 
resolution, defers his revenge to a more fatal 
opportunity. . . . ‘ 
The moral perfection of this character has been 
called in question, we think, by those who did not 
understand it. It is more interesting than ac- 
cording to rules; amiable tho not faultless. The 
ethical delineations of ‘‘that noble and Hberal 
casuist’’—as Shakespeare has been well called— 
do not exhibit the drab-colored Quakerism of 
morality. His plays are not copied either from 
“‘The Whole Duty of Man’’ or from ‘‘The 
Academy of Compliments!’’ We confess we area 
little shocked at the want of refinement in those 
who are shocked at the want of refinement in Ham- 
let. The neglect of punctilious exactness in his be- 
havior either partakes of the ‘‘license of the 
time,’’ or else belongs to the very excess of in- 
tellectual refinement in the character, which 
makes the common rules of life, as well as his: 
own purposes, sit loose upon him. He may be 
said to be amenable only to the tribunal of his 
own thoughts, and is too mueh taken up with the

  airy world of contemplation, to lay as mueh stress 
as he ought on the practical consequences of 
_things. His habitual principles of action are un- 
hinged and out of joint with the time. His con- 
duct to Ophelia is quite natural in his cireum- 
stanees. It is that of assumed severity only. It 
is the effect of disappointed hope, of bitter 
ets, of affection suspended, not obliterated, 
by the distractions of the scene around him! 
Amidst the natural and preternatural horrors of 
his situation, he might be excused in delicacy 
from carrying on a regular courtship, . When 
‘this father’s spirit was in arms,’’ it was not a 
time for the son to make love in. He could 
neither marry Ophelia, nor wound her mind by 
explaining the cause of his alienation, which he 
durst hardly trust himself to think of. It would 
have taken him years to have come to a direct 
explanation on the point. In the hai

DREAMS OF AN OPIUM-EATER* 
May 18.— The Malay has been a fearful enemy 
for months. Every night, through his means, I 
have been transported into Asiatic scenery. I 
know not whether others share in my feelings 
on this point, but I have often thought that if T 
were compelled to forego England, and to live in 
China, and among Chinese manners. and modes 
of life and scenery, I should go mad. The eauses 
of my horror lie deep, and some of them must be 
common to others. Southern Asia, in general, 
is the seat of awful images and associations. 
the cradle of the human race, it would have a 
dim and reverential feeling connected with it. But 
there are other reasons. No man can pretend 
that the wild, barbarous, and capricious, super- 
stitions of Africa, or of savage tribes elsewhere,

  . adfect'in the way that he is affected by the an- 
cent, monumental, cruel, and elaborate religions 
‘of Hindustan, ete. The mere antiquity of Asiatic 
things, of their institutions, history, modes of 
-\faith, ete. is so impressive that to me-the vast 
age-of the race and name overpowers the sense 
-of youth in the individual. A young’ Chinese 
seems to.me an antediluvian man renewed. Even 
Englishmen, tho not Bréd~in any knowledge of 
such institutions, can not but shudder at, the 
mystie sublimity of castés that have flowed apart, 
and refused to. mix, through such’ immemorial 
tracts of time; nor can any man fail to be awed 
py the names of the Ganges or t'¥e Euphrates. 
It contributes much Mo these feelings, that 
southern Asia is, and has been for thousands of 
years, the part of the earth most swarming with 
‘human life; the great officina gentium. Man is 
_.@ weed in those regions. The vast empires, also, 
“into whieh the enormous population of Asia has 
valways been cast, give a further sublimity to the 
feelings associated with’ all Oriental names or * 
images. In China, over and above what it has 
in tommon with ‘the rest of southern Asia, I 
‘am terrified by the modes of life, by the manners, 
and the barrier of utter abhorrence and want of 
sympathy placed between us by feelings deeper 
than. I. can analyze. I could sooner live with 
lunaties or brute animals. All this, and much 
more than ‘I. can say, or have time to say, the 
réadér must enter into before he can comprehend 
the ‘unimaginable ‘horror which these dreams of 
_ Oriental imagery and mythological tortures im- 
prest upon.me. Under the connecting feeling 
. of ‘tropical heat and vertical sunlights I brought

  together all creatures, birds, beasts, reptiles, all 
trees and plants, usages and appearances, that _ 
are to be found in all tropical regions, and as- 
sembled them together in China. or Hindustan. 
From kindred feelings I goon brought: Egypt and 
all her gods under the same law. I was stared at, 
hooted at, grinned at, chattered at, by. monkeys, 
by parrakeets, by cockatoos. I ran into pagodas, 
and was fixt for centuries at the summit, or in 
secret rooms; I was the idol; I was the priest; T 
was worshiped; I was sacrificed. I fled from 
the wrath of Brahma, through all the forests of 
Asia; Vishnu hated me; Seeva laid wait for me. 
I came suddenly upon Isis and Osiris; I had done 
a deed, they said, which the ibis and the crocodile 
trembled at. I was buried for a thousand years, 
in stone: coffins, with mummies and sphinxes, in 
narrow ehambers, at the heart of eternal pyra- 
mids. I was kissed, with cancerous: kisses, by 
crocodiles, and was laid, confounded with all 
unutterable abortions, amongst reeds. and Nilotic 
mud. - . 
Some slight abstraction I thus attempt of my 
Oriental dreams, which filled me always with such 
amazement at the monstrous scenery, that horror 
seemed absorbed for a while in sheer astonish- 
ment. Sooner or later came a reflux of feeling 
that swallowed up the astonishment, and left me, 
not so much in terror, ag in hatred and abomina- 
tion of what I saw. Over every form, and threat, ’ 
and punishment, and dim sightless inearceration, 
brooded a killing sense of eternity and infinity... 
Into these dreams only it was; with one or two - 
slight exceptions, that any cireumstances ‘of 
physical horror entered. All before had been 
17
-P-A-G-E-125
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  moral ‘and spiritual terrors. But here the main 
-agents were ugly birds, or snakes, or crocodiles, 
especially the last. The eurst erocodile became 
to. me the object of more horror than all the 
rest. I was compelled to live with him, and (as 
was always the case in my dreams) for centuries. 
Sometimes I escaped, and found myself in 
Chinese houses. All the feet of the tables, sofas, 
ete., soon became instinct with life; the abominable 
head of the crocodile, and his leering eyes, looked 
out at me, multiplied into ten thousand repe- 
titions; and I stood loathing and fascinated. So 
often did this hideous reptile haunt my dreams, 
that many times the very same dream was broken 
up in the very same way. I heard gentle voices 
speaking to me (I hear everything when I am 
sleeping), and instantly I awake; it was broad 
noon, and my children were standing, hand in 
hand, at my bedside, come to show me their 
colored shoes, or new frocks, or to let me see 
them drest for going out. No experience was so 
awful to me, and at the same time so pathetic, 
as this abrupt translation from the darkness of 
the infinite to the gaudy summer air of highest 
noon, and from the unutterable abortions of mis- 
created gigantie vermin to the sight of infancy 
and innocent human natures. 
June 1819.—I have had occasion to remark, at 
various periods of my life, that the deaths of 
those whom we love, and, indeed, the contempla- 
tion’ of death generally, is (cawteris paribus) 
more affecting in summer than in any other sea- 
son of the year. And the reasons are these three, 
I think: first, that the visible heavens in summer 
appear far higher, more distant, and (if such a 
118
-P-A-G-E-126
eS 
THOMAS DE QUINCEY. , 
Henne ee EEE EERIE! 
solecism may be excused) more infinite; the 
clouds by which chiefly the eye expounds the dis- 
tance of the blue pavilion stretched over our 
heads are in summer more voluminous, more 
magsed, and are accumulated in far grander and 
more towering piles; secondly, the light and the 
appearances of the declining and the setting sun 
are much more fitted to be types and characters 
of the infinite; and thirdly (which is the main 
reason), the exuberant and riotous prodigality 
of life naturally forces the mind more powerfully 
upon the antagonist thought of death, and the 
wintry sterility of the grave. For it may be ob~ 
served generally, that wherever two thoughts 
stand related to each other by a law of antago- 
nism, and exist, as it were by mutual repulsion, 
they are apt to suggest each other. On these ac- 
counts it ig that I find it impossible to banish 
the thought of death when I am walking alone 
in the endless days of summer; and any particular 
death, if not actually more affecting, at least 
haunts my mind more obstinately and besiegingly 
in that season. Perhaps this cause, and a slight 
incident which I omit, might have been the im- 
mediate oeeasions of the following dream, to 
which, however, a predisposition must always 
have existed in my mind; but, having been once 
roused, it never left. me, and split into a. thon- 
sand fantastie variations, which often suddenly 
recombined, locked back into a startling unity, 
and restored the original dream. 
I thought that it was a Sunday morning in May; 
that it was Easter Sunday, and as yet very early 
in the morning. I was standing, as it seemed to 
me, at the door of my own cottage. Right before 
119
-P-A-G-E-127
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD'S CLASSICS 
  me lay the very scene which could really be com- 
manded from that situation, but exalted, as was 
‘usual, and solemnized by the power of dreams. 
‘There were the same mountains, and the same 
Jovely valley at their. feet; but the mountains 
were raised to more than Alpine height; and there 
‘was interspace far larger between them of savan- 
nahs and forest lawns; the hedges were rieh with 
white roses; and no living creature was to be 
seen, excepting that in the green churehyard 
there were cattle tranquilly reposing upon the 
verdant graves, and particularly round about the 
grave of a child whom I had once tenderly loved, 
just as I had really beheld them, a little before 
sunrise, in the same summer when that child 
died. I gazed upon the well-known scene, and 
I said to myself: ‘‘It yet wants much of sunrise; 
and it is Easter Sunday; and that is the day.on 
‘which they celebrate the first-fruits of Resurree- 
tion. I will walk abroad; old griefs. shall be 
forgotten to-day: for the air is cool and still, and 
the hills are high, and stretch away to heaven; 
and the churchyard is as verdant as. the forest 
lawns, and the forest lawns are as quiet as the 
churchyard; and with the dew I can. wash the 
fever from my forehead; and then I shall be ux- 
happy no longer.’’ I turned, as if to open my 
garden gate, and immediately I saw upon the 
left a scene far different; but which yet.the power 
of dreams had reconciled into harmony. The 
seene was an Oriental one; and there also it was 
Easter ‘Sunday, and very *early in the morning. 
And at a vast distanee were visible, as a stain

  perhaps in childhood from some picture of Jeru- 
salem. And not a bow-shot ‘from me, upon a 
stone, shaded by Judean palms,’ there: sat a 
woman; and I looked, and it was-Ann! . She 
fixt her eyes upon me earnestly; 3 and T said.to her 
at length, ‘‘So, then, I have found-you at. last.” 
I waited; but she answered me not a word. Her 
face was the same as when I saw it last; the 
same, and yet again how different! Seventeen years 
ago, when the lamp-light of mighty London fell 
upon her face, as for the last time I kissed her 
lips (lips, Ann, that to me were not. polluted !), 
her eyes were streaming with tears. The tears _ 
were now no longer seen. Sometimes she seemed 
altered; yet again sometimes not altered; and 
hardly older. Her looks were tranquil, but with 
unusual solemnity of expression, and I now gazed 
upon her with some awe. Suddenly. her counte- 
nance grew dim; and, turning to the mountains, 
IT pereeived vapors rolling between us; in a mo- 
ment all had vanished; thick darkness came on; 
and in the twinkling of an eye I was far away 
from mountains, and by lamp-light in London, 
walking again with Ann—just as we had walked 
when both children, eighteen years before, along 
the endless terraces at Oxford Street. 
Then suddenly would come a dream of far 
different character—a tumultuous dream—com- 
mencing with a musie such as now I often heard - 
in sleep—musie of preparation and of awaken- 
ing suspense. The undulations of. fast-gathering 
tumults were like the opening of the Coronation 
Anthem; and like that, gave the feeling of a 
multitudinous movement, of infinite cavalcades 
filing off, and the tread of. innumerable armies.

  The morning was come of a mighty day—a day 
of crisis and an ultimate hope for human nature, 
then suffering mysterious eclipse, and laboring 
in some dread extremity. Somewhere, but .I knew 
not where—somehow, but I knew not how—by 
some beings, but I knew not by whom—a battle, 
a strife, an agony, was traveling through all its 
stages—was evolving itself, like the eatastrophe 
of some mighty. drama, with which my sympathy 
was the more insupportable, from deepening con- 
fusion as to its local scene, its cause, its nature, 
and its undecipherable issue. I (as is usual in 
dreams, where of necessity, we make ourselves 
central to every movement) had the power, and 
yet had not the power, to decide it, I had the 
power, if I could raise myself to will it; and yet 
again had not the power, for the weight of twenty 
Atlanties was upon me, or the oppression of in- 
expiable guilt. ‘‘Deeper than ever plummet 
sounded,’’ I lay inactive. Then, like a ehorus, 
the passion deepened. Some greater interest was 
at stake, some mightier cause, than ever yet the 
sword had pleaded,. or trumpet had proclaimed. 
Then came sudden alarms; hurryings to and fro, 
’ trepidations of innumerable fugitives; I knew 
‘not whether from the good cause or the bad; 
darkness and lights; tempest and human faces; 
and at last, with the sense that all was lost, 
female forms, and the features that were worth 
all the world to me: and but a moment allowed— 
and clasped hands, with heartbreaking partings, 
and then—everlasting farewells! and, with a sigh 
such as ‘the caves of hell sighed when the incestu- 
ous mother uttered the abhorred name of Death,

from her belief in the darkness that was trav-

very manner of her death; she saw not in vision, 
perhaps, the aerial altitude of the fiery scaffold, 
the spectators without end on every road pouring 
into Rouen-as to a coronation, the surging smoke, 
the volleying flames, the hostile faces all around, 
the pitying eye that lurked but here and there

decorate no garland for her. Flower nor bud,

On the Wednesday after Trinity Sunday in 
: 1431, being then about nineteen years of age, 
the Maid of Are underwent her martyrdom. She 
was conducted before midday, guarded by eight 
hundred spearmen, to a platform of prodigious 
height, constructed of wood billets supported by 
hollow spaces in every direction, for the ereation 
of air-currents. ‘‘The pile struck terror,’’ says 
M. Michelet, ‘‘by its height.”” . . . There 
would be a certainty of calumny arising against 
her—somé people would impute to her a willing- 
ness to recant. No innocence could escape that. 
Now, had she really testified this willingness on 
the seaffold, it would have argued nothing at all 
but the weakness of a genial nature shrinking from 
the instant approach of torment. And those will - 
often pity that weakness most, who in their own 
“persons would yield to it least. Meantime there 
never was a calumny uttered that drew less sup- 
port from the recorded cireéumstances, It rests 
upon no positive testimony, and it has a weight 
of contradicting testimony to stem. . . . What 
else but her meek, saintly demeanor won, from 
the enemies that till now had believed her a 
witch, tears of rapturous admiration? ‘‘Ten 
thousand men,’’ says M. Michelet himself, ‘‘ten 
thonsand men wept; and of these ten thousand 
the majority were political enemies knitted to- 
gether by cords of superstition. What else was

for pardon to his share in the tragedy? And if 
all this were insufficient, then I cite the closing

He did so. The fiery smoke rose up in billowy

almost at her side. Wrapt up in his sublime 
office, he saw not the danger, but still persisted 
in his prayers, Even then when the last enemy 
was racing up the fiery stairs to seize her, even. 
at that moment did this noblest of girls think 
only for him, the one friend that would not 
forsake her, and not for herself; bidding him 
with her last breath to care for his own preservya-

Iv sounds paradoxical, but is not so in a bad 
sense, to say that in every literature of large 
compass some authors will be found to rest much 
of the interest which surrounds them on their 
essential non-popularity. They are good for the 
very reason that they are not in conformity to 
the eurrent taste. They interest beeause to the 
world they are not interesting. They attract by 
means of their repulsion. Not as tho it could 
separately furnish a reason for loving a book, 
that the majority of men had found it repulsive. 
Prima ‘facie, it must suggest some presumption 
‘against a book that it has failed to gain public 
‘attention. To have. roused: hostility indeed, to 
have kindled a feud against its own principles 
or its temper, may happen to be a good ‘sign. 
That argues power. Hatred may be promising. 
The deepest revolutions of. minds sometimes begin 
in hatred. But simply to have left a reader 
unimprest is in itself a neutral result, from which 
‘the inference is doubtful. Yet even that, even 
simple failure to impress, may happen at times 
to be.a result from positive powers in a writer, 
from special originalities such as rarely reflect 
themselves in. the mirror of the ordinary under- 
standing... It seems little to be perceived, how

erature as well as in life. peites 
In reality, the very same. combinations. of 
moral qualities, infinitely varied, which. compose 
the harsh physiognomy of what. we call worldli- 
ness in the living groups of life, must unavoidably 
present themselves in books. A-library divides 
into sections of worldly and unworldly, even ‘as 
a crowd of men divides into that same majority 
and minority. The world has an instinct for 
recognizing its own, and recoils from certain 
qualities when exemplified in books with the 
same disgust. or defective sympathy as would 
have governed it in real life. From qualities, 
for instance, of childlike simplicity, of shy pro- 
fundity, or of inspired self-communion, the world 
does and must turn away its face toward grosser, 
bolder, more determined, or more intelligible 
expressions of character and intelleet; and not 
otherwise in literature, nor at all less in litera- 
ture, than it does in the realities of life. 
Charles Lamb, if any ever was, is amongst 
the class here contemplated; he, if any ever has, 
ranks amongst writers whose works are destined 
to be forever unpopular, and yet forever inter- 
esting; interesting moreover by means of those 
very qualities which guarantee their non-popu- 
larity. The same qualities which will be found 
forbidding to the worldly and the- thoughtless, 
which will be found insipid to many even amongst, 
robust and powerful minds, are exactly those 
which will continue to command a select audience 
in every generation. The prose essays, under 
the signature of ‘‘Elia,’’ form the most delight- 
ful section amongst Lamb’s works. They traverse 
v—9 129

a peculiar field of observation, sequestered/from 
general interest; and they are composed in a 
spirit too delicate and unobtrusive to eateh the 
ear of the noisy crowd, clamoring for strong 
sensations. But this retiring delicacy itself, the 
-pensiveness checkered by gleams of the fanciful, 
and the humor that is touched with cross-lights 
of pathos, together with the picturesque quaint- 
ness of the objects casually described, whether 
men, or things, or usages; and in the rear of 
all this, the constant recurrence to ancient recol- 
lections and to decaying forms of household life, 
as things retiring before the tumult of new and 
revolutionary generations; these traits in com- 
bination communicate to the papers a grace and 
strength of originality which nothing in any lit- 
erature approaches, whether for degree or kind of 
excellence, except the most felicitous papers of 
Addison, such as those on Sir Roger de Coverley, 
and some others in the same vein of composi- 
tion. They resemble Addison’s papers also in 
the diction, which is natural and idiomatic even 
to carelessness. They are equally faithful to the 
truth of nature; and in this only they differ re- 
markably—that the sketches of Elia reflect the 
stamp and impress of the writer’s own character, 
whereas in all those of Addison the personal 
peculiarities of the delineator (tho known to the 
~ reader from the beginning through the account 
of the club) are nearly quiescent. Now and then 
they are recalled into a momentary notice, but 
they do not aet, or at all modify his pictures of 
Sir Roger or Will -Wimble. They are amiably 
eccentric; but the Spectator in describing them, 
takes the station of an ordinary observer.

  THOMAS DE QUINCEY 
  Everywhere, indeed, in the writings of Lamb, 
and not merely in his ‘‘Elia,’’ the character of 
the writer cooperates in an undercurrent to make 
the effect of the thing written. To understand in 
the fullest sense either the gaiety or the tenderness 
of a particular passage, you must have some 
insight into the peculiar bias of the writer’s 
mind, whether native and original, or imprest 
gradually by the accidents of situation; whether 
simply developed out of predispositions by the 
action of life, or violently scorched into the con- 
stitution by some fierce fever of calamity. There 
is in modern literature a whole class of writers, 
tho not a large one, standing within the same 
eategory; some marked originality of character 
in the writer becomes a coefficient with what he 
says to a common result; you must sympathize 
with this personality in the author before you 
can appreciate, the most significant parts of his 
views. In most books the writer figures as a 
mere abstraction, without sex or age or local 
station, whom the reader banishes from his 
thoughts. What is written seems to proceed 
from a blank intellect, not from a man elothed 
with fieshly peculiarities and differences. These 
peculiarities and differences neither do, nor (gen- 
erally speaking) could intermingle with the tex- 
ture of the thoughts so as to modify their force 
or their direction. Ia such books—and they form 
the vast majority—there is nothing to be found 
or to be looked for beyond the direct objective. 
(Sit venia verbo!) 
But in a small section of books, the objective 
in the thought becomes confinent with the sub- . 
jective in the thinker—the two forces unite for 
131,

a joint product; and fully to enjoy the product, 
or fully to apprehend either element, both must 
be known. It is singular and worth inquiring 
into,-for the reason that the Greek and Roman 
literature had no'such books. Timon of Athens, 
or Diogenes, one may conceive qualifiéd for this 
mode of authorship, had. journalism existed to 
rouse them in those days; their ‘‘articles’’ would 
no doubt have been fearfully caustic. But as 
they failed to produce anything, and Lucian in 
an after age is scarcely characteristic enough 
for the purpose, perhaps we may pronounce 
Rabelais and Montaigne the earliest of writers 
in. the class deseribed. In the century following 
theirs came Sir Thomas Browne, and immediately 
after him La Fontaine. Then came Swift, Sterne, 
with others less distinguished; in Germany, Hip- 
pel the friend of Kant, Harmann the obseure, and 
the greatest-of the whole body—Jean Paul Fried- 
rich Richter. In him, from the strength and de- 
terminateness of his: nature as well as ‘from the 
great extent of his writing, the philosophy of 
this. interaction between the author as a human 
agency: and his theme as an intellectual reagency 
might best be studied.. From him might be de- 
rived: the largest number of cases, illustrating 
boldly this absorption of the universal into the 
conerete—of the pure-intellect into the human 
nature of the author. But: nowhere could illus- 
trations be found more interesting—shy, delicate, 
evanescent—shy as ‘lightning, delicate and eva- 
nescent as the colored pencilings on.a frosty 
night. from’ ithe’ Northern Lights, than in the 
better parts of Lamb.

  that his character and temperament should be 
understood in their coyest and most wayward 
features. A capital defect it would be if these 
could not be gathered silently from Lamb’s works 
themselves. It would bea fatal. mode of de- 
pendency upon an alien and separable-aecident. if 
they needed an external-commentary. But they. 
do not. The syllables lurk up and down the. 
writings of Lamb,. which decipher. -his eccentric 
nature. His character lies there dispersed- in 
anagram; and to any attentive reader the re- 
gathering and restoration of the total word from 
its scattered parts is inevitable without an effort. 
Still it is always a satisfaction in knowing a 
result, to know also its why and how; and in so 
far as every character is likely. to be modified 
by the particular experience, sad or joyous, 
through which the life has traveled, it is a good 
contribution toward. the knowledge of that re- 
sulting character as a whole to have a. sketch 
of that particular experience. What trials did 
it impose? What energies did it task? What 
temptations did it unfold? These ealls: upon the 
moral ‘powers, which in musie so. stormy many 
a life is doomed to hear—how were they faced? 
The character in a capital degree molds often- 
times the life, but the life always in a subor- 
dinate degree molds the character. And the 
character being in this case of Lamb so much of 
a key to the writings, it becomes important that 
the life should be traced, however briefly, as a 
key to the character.

reach you somewhere about Ada’s birthday—the

  in distance or nearness; every day that keeps 
us asunder should after so long a period rather 
soften our mutual feelings, which must always 
have one rallying point so long as our child 
exists, which I presume we both hope will be 
long after either of her parents. 
The time which has elapsed since our separa- 
tion has been considerably more than the whole 
brief period of our union, and the not much 
longer one of our prior acquaintance. We both 
made a bitter mistake, but now it is over and 
irrevocably so. For, at thirty-three on my part, 
and a few years less on yours, tho it is no very 
extended period of life, still it is one when the 
habits and thought are generally so formed as 
to admit of no modification; and as we could 
not agree while young, we should with difficulty 
do so now. 
T say all this because I own to you, that, not- 
withstanding everything, I considered our union 
as not impossible for more than a year after the 
separation; but then I gave up the hope entirely 
and forever. But the very impossibility of re- 
union seems to me at least a reason why, on all 
the few points of discussion which can arise be- 
tween us, we should preserve the courtesies of 
life, and as much of its kindness as people who 
are never to meet may preserve perhaps more 
easily than nearer connections. For my own 
part, I am violent but not malignant; for only 
fresh provocation ean awaken my resentment. 
To you, who are colder and more concentrated, 
I would just hint that you may sometimes mis- 
take the depth of a cold anger for dignity and 
a worse feefing for duty. I assure you that I

resentment whatever. Remember, that. if you 
have injured me in aught, the forgiveness is 
something; and that if I have injured-you it-is 
something more still, if it be true, as the moralists 
say, that the most offending are the least for- 
ving. . 
Whether the offense has been solely.on my 
side, or reciproeal, or on yours chiefly, I have 
ceased to reflect upon any but two things, viz., 
that you are. the mother of my. child, and that 
we shall never meet again. I think if-you also 
consider the two corresponding points with refer- 
ence to myself, it will be better for all-three.

do me a service, when it required not merely 
kindness, but courage to do so; to have been 
recorded by you in such a manner would have 
been a proud memorial at any time, but at such = 
a time, when ‘‘all the world and his wife,’’ as 
the proverb goes, were trying to trample upon 
me, was something still higher to my self-esteem 
—I allude to the Quarterly Review of the Third 
Canto of ‘‘Childe Harold,’’ which Murray told me 
was written by you—and, indeed, I should have 
known it without his information, as there could 
not be two who could and would have done this 
at the time. Had it been a common criticism, 
however eloquent or panegyrical, I should have 
felt pleased, undoubtedly, and grateful, but not 
to the extent which the extraordinary good- 
heartedness of the whole proceeding must induce 
in any mind capable of such sensations. . The 
very tardiness of this acknowledgment will, at 
least, show that I have not forgotten the obliga- 
tion; and I can assure you that my sense of. it 
has been out at compound interest during the 
delay. I shall only add one word upon the ‘sub- 
ject, which is, that I think that you, and Jeffrey, 
and Leigh Hunt, were the only literary men, of

those three, I had never seen one at all-—of the 
‘ second much less than I desired—and that the third 
was under no kind of obligation to me whatever; 
while the other two had been actually attacked 
by me on a former occasion; one, indeed, with 
some provocation, but the other wantonly enough.

Tus beautiful but barren Hymettus—the whole 
coast of Attica, her hills and mountains, Pente- 
licus, Anchesmus, Philopappus, ete., ete.—are in 
themselves poetical, and would be so if the name 
of Athens, of Athenians, and her very ruins, 
were swept from the earth. But am I to be 
told that the ‘‘nature’’ of Attiea would be more 
poetical without the ‘‘art’’ of the Acropolis? of 
the temple of Theseus? and of the still all Greek 
and glorious monuments of her exquisitely artifi- 
cial genius? Ask the traveler what strikes him 
*¥rom the reply to Bowles. William L. Bowles, clergy: 
man, poet and antiquarian, was born in 1762, and died in 
1850. In 1806 he had issued an edition of Pope in ten 
volumes, to which was prefixt a sketch of the poet’s life, with 
severe criticisms on his poetry. These criticisms gave rise 
to & controversy, famous in its time and long afterward, and 
to which Byron’s article was a notable contribution,

  ‘as: most :poetical—the Parthenon, or the roek on 
which it stands? The columns of Cape Colonna,’ 
or the cape itself? The rocks at the foot of it, 
‘or the recollection that Faleoner’s ship* was 
bulged upon them? There are a thousand rocks 
and capes far more picturesque than those of 
the Acropolis and Cape Sunium in themselves; 
what are they to a thousand scenes in the wilder 
parts of Greece, of Asia Minor, Switzerland, or 
even of Cintra in Portugal, or to many scenes 
of Italy, and the Sierras of Spain? 
But it is the ‘‘art,’’ the columns, the temples, 
the wrecked vessels, which give them their an- 
tique and their modern poetry and not the spots 
themselves. ‘Without them, the spots of earth 
would ‘be. untoticed and unknown; buried, like 
Babylon and Nineveh, in indistinct confusion, 
without poetry, as without existence; but to 
whatever spot of earth these ruins were trans- 
ported, if they were capable of transportation, 
like the obelisk, and the sphinx, and Memnon’s 
head, there they would still exist in the per- 
fection of their beauty, ‘and in the pride of their 
poetry. I opposed, and will ever oppose, the 
robbery of ruins from Athens to instruct the 
English in seulpture; but why did I do so? The 
ruins are as poetical in Piccadilly as they were 
in the Parthenon; but the Parthenon and its 
TOape Colonna (anciently called Sunium) lies at the 
southeastern end.of Attica and is a promontory.

Mr. Bowles contends again that the pyramids 
of Egypt are poetical because of ‘‘the associa- 
tion with boundless deserts,’’ and that a ‘‘pyr- 
amid of the same dimensions’? would not be 
sublime in ‘‘Lincoln’s-Inn-Fields’’: not:so poet- 
ical certainly; but take away the ‘‘pyramids,’’ 
and what is the ‘‘desert’’? Take away Stone- 
henge from Salisbury Plain, and it. is nothing 
more than Hounslow Heath, or any other un- 
inclosed down. It appears to me that St. Peter’s 
the Coliseum, the Pantheon, the Palatine, the .. 
Apollo, the. Laccoon, the Venus dei Medici, the . 
Hercules, the Dying Gladiator, the Moses of 
Michelangelo, and all the higher works of 
Canova (I have already spoken of those of an- 
cient Greece, still extant in that country, or 
transported to England), are as poetical as Mont 
Blane, or Mount AStna, perhaps still more so, as 
they are direct manifestations of mind, and pre- 
suppose poetry in their very coneeption; and 
have, moreover, as being such, a something of 
actual life, which can not belong to any part of 
inanimate nature—unless we adopt the system 
of Spinoza, that the world is the Deity. There 
ean be nothing more poetical in its aspect than 
the city of Venice; does this depend upon. the 
sea, or the canals?

and the prison, or the Bridge of Sighs, which 
connects ‘them, that renders it poetical? Is it

  the Canal Grande, or the Rialto which arches it, 
the churches which tower over it, the palaces 
which Hine, and the gondolas which glide over, 
the waters, that render this city more poetical 
than Rome itself? Mr. Bowles will say, perhaps, 
that the Rialto is but marble, the palaces and 
churches are only stone, and the gondolas a 
‘“eoarse’’ black cloth thrown over some planks of 
carved wood, with a shining bit of fantastically 
formed iron at the prow, ‘‘without’’ the water. 
And f tell him that, without these, the water 
would be nothing but a clay-colored ditch; and 
whoever says the contrary deserves to be at the 
bottom of that where Pope’s heroes are embraced 
by the mud nymphs. There would be nothing 
to make the canal of Venice more poetical than 
that of Paddington, were it not for the artificial 
adjunets above mentioned, altho it is a perfectly 
natural canal, formed by the sea and the in- 
numerable islands which constitute the site of 
this extraordinary city. . . 
The very Cloaca of Tarquin at Rome are as 
poetical as Richmond Hill; many will think so: 
take away Rome and leave the Tiber and the 
seven hills in the nature of Evander’s time. Let 
Mr. Bowles, or Mr. Wordsworth, or Mr. Southey, 
or any of the other ‘‘naturals,’’ make a poem 
upon them, and then see which is most poetical 
—their production, or the commonest guide-book 
which tells you the road from St. Peter’s to the 
Coliseum, and informs you what you will see 
by the-way. The ground interests in Virgil, 
because it will be Rome, and not because it is 
Evander’s rural domain.

  his service in answer to a remark of Mr. Camp- 
bell’s, that ‘‘Homer was a great deseriber of 
works of art.’? Mr. Bowles contends that all 
his great power, even in this, depends upon their 
connection with nature. The ‘‘shield of Achilles 
derives its poetical interest from the subjects 
described on it.’’ And from what does the spear 
of Achilles derive its interest? and the helmet 
and the mail worn by Patroelus, and the celes- 
tial armor, and the very brazen greaves of the 
well-booted Greeks? Is it solely from the legs, 
and the back, and the breast, and the human 
body, which they enclose? In that ease it would 
have been more poetical to have made them fight — 
naked; and Gully and Gregson, as being nearer 
to a state of nature are more poetical boxing 
in a pair of drawers, than Hector and Achilles 
in radiant armor and with heroic weapons. 
Instead of the clash of helmets, and the rushing 
of chariots, and the whizzing of spears, and the 
glancing of swords, and the cleaving of shields, 
and the piereing of breastplates, why not repre- 
sent the Greeks and Trojans like two savage 
tribes, tugging and tearing, and kicking and 
biting, and gnashing, foaming, grinning, and 
gouging, in all the poetry of martial nature, 
unencumbered with gross, prosaic, artificial arms; 
an equal superfiuity to the natural warrior and 
his natural poet? Is there anything unpoetical 
in Ulysses striking the horses of Rhesus with 
his bow (having forgotten his thong), or would, 
Mr. Bowles have had him kick them with his 
foot, or smack them with his hand, as being 
more unsophisticated ? 
In Gray’s ‘‘Elegy’’ is there an image more

THE BEST OF THE WORLD'S CLASSICS 
a  EEEEEEEEEEEneed 
striking than his ‘‘shapeless sculpture’? Of 
seulpture in general, it may be observed that 
it is more poetical than nature itself, inasmuch 
as it represents and bodies forth that ideal beauty 
and sublimity which is never to be found in 
actual nature. This, at least, is the general 
opinion. But, always excepting the Venus dei 
Medici, I differ from that opinion, at least as 
far as regards female beauty; for the head of 
Lady Claremont (when I first saw her nine years 
ago) seemed to possess all that sculpture could 
require for its ideal. I recollect seeing some- 
thing of the same kind in the head of an Al- 
banian girl, who was actually employed in mend- 
ing a road in the mountains, and in some Greek, 
and one or two Italian faces. But of sublimity 
I have never seen anything in human nature at 
all to approach the expression of sculpture, either 
in the Apollo, in the Moses, or other of the 
sterner works of ancient or modern art. 
Let us examine a little further this ‘‘babble 
. of green fields’’ and of bare nature in general 
as superior to artificial imagery, for the poetical 
purposes of the fine arts. In landscape painting 
the great artist does not give you a literal copy 
of a country, but he invents and composes one. 
Nature, in her natural aspect, does not furnish 
him with such existing scenes as he requires. 
Everywhere he presents you with some famous 
city, or celebrated scene from mountain or other 
nature; it mnst be taken from some particular 
point of view, and with such light, and shade, 
and distance, etc., as serve not only to heighten 
its beauties, but to shadow its deformities. The 
poetry of nature alone, exactly as she appears, 
148
-P-A-G-E-156
tpt 
LORD BYRON 
  is not sufficient to bear him out. The very sky 
of his painting is not the portrait, of the sky 
of nature; it is a composition of different: skies, 
observed at different times, and not the whole 
copied from any particular day. And why?- 
Because nature is not lavish of her beauties; 
they are widely scattered and occasionally dis- 
played, to be selected with care and gathered 
with difficulty. . . . 
Art is not inferior to nature for poetical pur- 
poses. What makes a regiment of soldiers a 
more noble object of view than the same mass 
of mob? Their arms, their dresses, their ban- 
ners, and the art and artificial symmetry of their 
position and movements. A Highlander’s plaid, 
a Mussulman’s turban, and a Roman toga are 
more poetical than the tattooed or untattooed New 
Sandwich savages, altho they were deseribed by 
William Wordsworth himself like the ‘‘idiot in 
his glory.’’ 
I have seen as many mountains as most men, 
and more fieets than the generality of landsmen; 
and, to my mind, a large convoy with a few 
sail of the line to conduct them is as noble and 
as poetical a prospect as all that inanimate na- 
ture can produce. I prefer the ‘‘mast of some 
great admiral,’’ with all its tackle, to the Scotch 
fir or the Alpine tarnen, and think that more 
poetry has been made out of it. In what does 
the infinite superiority of Falconer’s ‘‘Ship- 
wreck’’ over all other shipwrecks consist? In 
his admirable application of the terms of his 
art; in a poet sailor’s description of ‘the sailor’s 
fate. These very terms, by his application, make 
the strength and reality of his poem. Why?

beeause he was a poet, and in the hands of a 
poet art will not be found less ornamental than 
nature. It is precisely in general nature, and 
in stepping out of his element, that Falconer 
fails; where he digresses to speak of ancient 
Greece, and ‘‘sueh branches of learning.’’

IN DEFENSE OF POETRY* 
Tre functions of the poetical faculty are two- 
fold; by one it creates new materials of knowl- 
edge, and power, and pleasure; by the other it 
engenders in the mind a desire to reproduce 
and arrange them according to a certain rhythm 
and order which maybe called the beautiful and 
the good. The cultivation of poetry is never 
more to be desired. than at periods when, from 
an exeess of the selfish and calculating principle, 
1¥From an essay written sometime in 1820-21, and sug- 
gested by an article on poetry which his friend, Thomas 
Love Peacock, had contributed to the Literary Miscellany. 
John Addington Symonds, one of Shelley’s biographers, 
cites this paper as containing some of the finest prose 
writing of Shelley.

  the accumulation of the materials of external 
life exceed the quantity of the power of assim- 
ilating them to the internal laws of human na- 
ture. The body has then become too unwieldy 
for that which animates it. 
Poetry is indeed something divine. It is at 
once the center and circumference of knowledge; 
it is. that which eomprehends all science, and 
that to which all science must be referred. It 
is at the same time the root and blossom of all 
other systems of thought; it is that from which 
all spying, and that which adorns all; and that 
which, if blighted, denies the fruit and the seed, ' 
and withholds from the barren world the nourish- 
ment. and the succession of the scions of the 
tree of life. It is the perfect and consummate 
surface and bloom of all things; it is as the 
odor, and the eolor of the rose to the texture 
of the elements which compose it, as the form 
and splendor of unfaded beauty to the secrets 
of anatomy and corruption. What were virtue, 
love, patriotism, friendship—what were the sce- 
néery of this beautiful universe which we inhabit 
—what were our eonsolations on this side of 
the grave—and what were our aspirations beyond 
it, if poetry did not ascend to bring light and 
fire from those eternal regions where the owl- 
winged faculty of caleulation dare not ever soar? 
Poetry is not like reasoning, a power to be 
exerted according to the determination of the 
will.’ A man ean not say. it: ‘‘I will compose 
poetry.’? The greatest poet even can not say 
it; for the mind in creation is as a fading coal, 
which some invisible influence, like an inconstant 
_/ wind, awakens te. transitory brightness; this 
152
-P-A-G-E-160
  PERCY BYSSHE SHELLEY 
  power arises from within, like the eolor of a 
flower which fades and changes as it is developed, 
and the conscious portions of our natures are 
unprophetie either of its approach or its depar- 
ture. Could this influence be durable in its 
original purity and foree, it is impossible to 
predict the greatness of the results; but when 
composition begins, inspiration is already on the 
decline, and the most glorious poetry that has 
ever been communicated to the world is probably 
a feeble shadow of the original conception of 
the poet. I appeal to the greatest poets of the 
present day, whether it is not an error to assert 
that the finest passages of poetry are produced 
by labor and study. The toil and the delay re¢- 
ommended by erities can be justly interpreted 
to mean no more than a careful observation of 
the inspired moments, and an artificial eonnection 
of the space between their suggestions by the 
intermixture of conventional expression: a neces- 
sity only imposed by the limitedness of the poet- 
ieal faculty itself; for Milton conceived the 
‘Paradise Lost’? as a whole before he exeeuted 
it in portions. We have his own authority also 
for the muse having ‘‘dictated’’ to him the ‘‘un- 
premeditated song.’’ And let this be an answer 
to those who allege the fifty-six various readings. 
of the first line of the ‘‘Orlando Furioso.’’. Com- 
positions so produced are to poetry what mosaic 
is to painting. This instinct and intuition of 
the poetical faculty is still more observable in 
the plastic and pictorial arts; a great statue or 
picture grows under the power of the artist as a 
child in the mother’s womb; and the very mind 
which directs the hands in formation is incapable 
153
-P-A-G-E-161
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD'S CLASSICS 
  of accounting to itself for the origin, the grada- 
tions or the media of the process. 
Poetry is the record of the best and happiest 
moments of the happiest and best minds, We are 
aware of evanescent visitations of thought and 
feeling sometimes associated with place or per- 
son, sometimes regarding our own mind alone, 
and always arising unforeseen and departing un- 
bidden, but, elevating and delightful beyond all 
expression: so that even in the desire and the 
regret they leave, there can not but be pleasure, 
participating as it does in the nature of its object. 
It is as it were the interpenetration of a diviner 
nature through our own; but its footsteps are 
like those of a wind over the sea which the coming 
ealm erases, and whose traces remain only, 8s 
on the wrinkled sand which paves it. These and 
corresponding conditions of being are experienced 
principally by those of the most delicate sen- 
sibility and the most enlarged imagination; and 
the state of mind produced by them is at war 
with every base desire. The enthusiasm of vir- 
tue, love, patriotism, and friendship is essentially 
linked with such emotions; and while they last, 
self appears as what it is, an atom to a universe. 
Poets are not. only subject to these experiences 
as spirits of the most refined organization, but 
they can color all that they combine with the 
evanescent hues of this ethereal world; a word, 
a trait in the representation of a scene or a_ 
passion, will touch the enehanted chord, and re- 
animate, in those who have ever experienced 
these emotions, the sleeping, the cold, the buried 
image of the past. Poetry thus makes immortal 
all that is best and most beautiful in the world;

  it arrests the vanishing apparitions which haunt 
the interlunations of life, and veiling them, or 
in language or in form, sends them, forth a'nong 
mankind, bearing sweet news of kindred jc y to 
those with whom their sisters abide—abide, be- 
cause there is no portal of expression from the 
caverns of the spirit which they inhabit into the 
universe of things. Poetry redeems from decay 
the visitations of the divinity in man.

THE BATHS OF CARACALLA* 
Tue next most considerable relic of antiquity, 
considered as a ruin, is the Therme of Caraealla. 
These consist of six enormous chambers, above 
200 feet in height, and each enclosing a vast 
space like that of a field. There are in addition 
a number of towers and labyrinthine recesses, 
2Qne of Shelley's many letters to his friend, Thomas 
Love Peacock, of which: Symonds says: ‘Taken altogether, 
they are the most. perfect specimens of descriptive prose 
in the BngNsh lenguage; never overcharged with color, 
vibrating with emotions excited by the stimulating scenes 
ef Italy, frank in criticisms, and exquisitely delicate in 
observation. Their transparent sincerity and unpremeditated 
grace, combined with natural finish of expression, make 
them masterpieees of a style at once familiar and elevated.” 
Tt was among the ruins of the Baths of Caracalla that 
Shelley wrote his poem ‘Prometheus Unbound.” Of this 
poem Shelley wrote from Florence on December 26, 1819, a 
letter the original of which is now owned in New York by 
Louis V. Ledoux: “My ‘Prometheus’ is the best thing I ever 
wrote.”

  hidden and woven over by the wild growth of 
clinging ivy. Never was any desolation more sub- 
lime and lovely. The perpendicular wall of ruin 
is ce] ven into steep ravines, filled up with flower- 
ing shrubs, whose thick twisted roots are knotted 
in the rifts of the stone, and at every step the 
aerial pinnacles of shattered stone group into 
new combinations of effect, towering a ove the 
lofty yet level walls; as the distant mountains 
change their aspect to one traveling rapidly to- 
ward the skirts by masses of the fallen ruins, 
overturned with the broad leaves of the ereeping 
weeds. The blue sky canopies it, and is as the 
everlasting roof of these enormous halls. But 
the most interesting effect remains. 
In one of the buttresses that supports an im- 
‘mense and lofty arch ‘‘which bridges the very 
wings of heaven’’ are the crumbling remains of 
an antique winding stairease, whose sides are 
open in many places to the precipice. This you 
ascend and arrive on the summit of these piles. 
There grow on every side thick entangled wilder- 
nesses of myrtle, and the myrletus and bay and 
the flowering laurestinus, whose white blossoms 
are, just developed, the white fig and a thousand 
nameless plants sown by the wandering winds. 
These woods are intersected on every side by 
paths, like sheep tracks through the eopse wood 
of steep mountains, which wind to every part of 
the immense labyrinth. From the midst rise 
those pinnacles and masses, themselves like 
masses which have been seen far below. In one 
place you wind along a narrow strip of weed- 
grown ruin: on one side is the immensity of 
_ earth and sky, on the other a narrow chasm,

  which is bounded by an arch of. enormous size, 
tinged by the many colored foliage and blossoms 
and supporting an irregular pyramid overgrown 
like itself with the all-pervading vegetation. 
Around rise other crags and other. peaks, all 
arrayed and the deformity of their vast. desola- 
tion softened down by the undecaying investiture 
of nature. Come to Kume—it is a scene by which 
expression is overpowered, which words ean not 
convey. . 
Still winding up one-half of the shattered 
pyramids, by the path through the blooming 
wood, you come to a little mossy lawn surrounded 
by the wild shrubs; it is overgrown with anem- 
ones, wall flowers and violets, whose stalks 
pierce the starry moss, and with radiant blue 
flowers whose name I know not, and which scatter 
through the air the divinest odor; which, as you 
recline under the shade of the ruin, produces 
sensations of voluptuous faintness, like the com- 
binations of sweet music. The paths still wind 
on, threading the perplexed windings, other laby- 
rinths, other lawns, deep dells of wood, and lofty 
rocks and terrific chasms. When I tell you that 
these ruins cover several acres and that the paths 
alone penetrate at least half their extent, your 
imagination will fill up all that I am unable to 
express of the astonishing scene.

THE RUINS OF POMPEII* 
Stvce you last heard from me we have been 
to see Pompeii and we are now waiting for the 
return of spring weather, to visit, first Pastum, 
and then the islands; after which we shall return 
to Rome. I was astonished at the remains of 
this city. I had no conception of anything so 
perfect yet remaining. My idea of the mode 
of its destruction was this: first an earthquake 
eame and shattered it, and unroofed almost ali 
its temples and split its columns; then a rain 
of light small pumice-stones fell; then torrents 
of boiling water mixt with ashes filled up its 
erevices. 
“A wide flat hill from which the city was ex- 
eavated is now covered with woods, and-you see 
the tombs and theaters, the temples and houses, 
surrounded by uninhabited wilderness. We en- 
tered the town from the sides toward the sea, 
and first saw two theaters; one more magnificent 
than the other, strewn with the ruins of the white 
marble which formed their seats. and cornices, 
wrought with deep bold seulpiure. In the front 
between the stage and the seats is the circular 
space oceasionally occupied by the chorus. The 
stage is very narrow but long and divided from 
this space by a narrow enclosure parallel to it, 
I suppose for the orchestra. On each side are

  the Consuls’ boxes, and below in the theater of 
Hereulaneum were found two equestrian statues 
of excellent workmanship, occupying the same 
space as the great bronze lamps. did at Drury 
Lane. The smallest of the theaters-is said to 
have been eomic, tho I should doubt. “From both 
you see, as you sit on the seats, a prospect of 
the most wonderful beauty. 
You then pass through ancient streets; they 
are very narrow and the houses rather small, 
but are constructed on an admirable plan, espe- 
eially for the climate. The rooms are built round 
a court, or sometimes two, according to the extent 
of the house. In the midst is a fountain some- 
times surrounded with a portico, supported on 
fluted columns of white stucco; the floor is paved 
with mosaics sometimes wrought in imitation of 
vine leaves, sometimes in quaint figures, and more 
or less beautiful according to the rank of the 
inhabitant. There were paintings on all, but 
most of them have been removed to decorate the 
royal museums. Little winged figures and small 
ornaments of exquisite elegance yet remain. There 
is an ideal life in the forms of these paintings 
of an incomparable loveliness, tho most are evi- 
dently the work of very inferior artists. It seems 
as if from the atmosphere of mental beauty that 
surrounds them, every human being caught a 
splendor not his own. 
In one house you see how the bedrooms were 
managed: a small sofa was built up, where the 
eushions were placed; two pictures, one repre- 
senting Diana and Endymion and the other Venus 
and Mars, decorate the chamber; and a little 
niche which contains the statue of a domestic

  god. The floor is composed of a rich mosaie of 
the rarest marbles, agate, jasper and porphyry; 
it looks to the marble fountain and the snow 
white columns, whose etablatures strew the floor 
of the portico they supported. The houses have 
only one story, and the apartments, tho not large, 
are very lofty. A great advantage results from 
this, wholly unknown in our cities. 
The public buildings, whose ruins are now 
forests as it were of white fluted columns, and 
which then supported entablatures loaded with 
_ seulpture, were seen on all sides over the roofs 
of the houses. This was the excellence of the 
ancients: their private expenses were compara- 
tively moderate; the dwelling of one of the chief 
senators of Pompeii is elegant. indeed, and 
adorned with the most beautiful specimens of 
art, but small. But their public buildings are 
everywhere marked by the bold and grand designs 
of an unsparing magnificence. In the little town 
of Pompeii (it contained about twenty thousand 
inhabitants) it is wonderful to see the number 
and grandeur of their publie buildings. 
Another advantage, too, is that in the present 
case the glorious scenery around is not shut out, 
and that unlike the inhabitants of the Cimmerian 
ravines of modern cities, the ancient Pompeiian 
could contemplate the clouds and the lamps of 
heaven; could see the moon rise high behind 
Vesuvius, and the sun set in the sea, tremulous 
with.an atmosphere of golden vapor, below Inar- 
nine and Misenum. . 
We next saw the temples. Of the temple of 
Aseulapius little remains but an altar of black 
_ stone, adorned with a cornice imitating the scales 
160 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
    PERCY BYSSHE SHELLEY 
  of a serpent. His statue in terra-cofta was found 
in the cell. The temple of Isis is more perfect. 
It is surrounded by a portico of fluted. eolumns, 
and in the area around it are two'altars, and 
many ceppi for statues; and a little ehapel of 
white stuceo, as hard as stone, of ‘the most ex- 
quisite proportions; its panels are adored -with 
figures in bas-relief, slightly indicatéd, bat of 
workmanship the most delicate that ean be on- 
ceived. They are Egyptian subjects executed by” 
a Greek artist, who has humanized all the un- 
natural extravagance of the original conception 
into the supernatural loveliness of his country’s 
genius. They searcely touch the ground with 
their feet, and their wind uplifted robes seem 
in the place of wings. The temple in the midst, 
raised on a high platform and approached by 
steps, was decorated with exquisite paintings, 
some of which we saw. in the museum at Porticai. 
It is small, of the same materials-as the chapel, 
with a pavement of mosaic, and fiuted Ionic 
columns of white stueco, so white that it dazzles. 
you to look at it. . 
Thence through other porticoes and labyrinths 
of walls and columns, some broken, some entire, 
their entablatures strewed under them. The tem- 
ple of Jupiter, of Venus, and another temple, 
the Tribunal, and the hall of publie justice with 
the forests of lofty columns, surround the Forum. 
Two pedestals or altars of an enormous size 
(for whether they were the altars of the temple 
of Venus before which they stand the guide could 
not tell) occupy the lower end of the Forum. 
At the upper end, supported on an elevated plat- 
form, stands the temple of Jupiter. Under the

  eolonnade of its portico we sat and pulled out 
our oranges and figs and bread (sorry fare, you 
will say) and started to eat. Here was a mag- 
nificent spectacle. Above and between the mul- 
titudinous shafts of the sunshiny columns was 
seen the sea, reflecting the purple heaven of noon 
above it, and supporting, as it were, on its lips 
the dark lofty mountains of Sorrento, of a blue 
indeseribably deep, and tinged toward their sum- 
mits with streaks of new fallen snow. Between 
‘was one small green island. To the right was 
Caprew, Inarnine, Prochyta, and Misenum. 
hind was the single summit of Vesuvius, rolling 
forth volumes of thick white smoke, whose foam- 
like column was sometimes darted into the clear 
dark sky and fell in little streaks along the wind. 
Between Vesuvius and the nearer mountains, as 
through a chasm, was seen the main line of the 
loftiest Apenines to the east. The day was 
radiated and warm. Every now and then we 
heard the subterranean thunder of Vesuvius; its 
distant and deep peals seem to shake the very 
air and light of day, which interpenetrated our 
frames with a sudden and tremendous sound. 
The seene was what the Greeks beheld (Pompeii, 
you know, was a Greek city). They lived in 
harmony with nature, and the interstices of their 
incomparable columns were portals, as it were, 
to admit the spirit of beauty which animates this 
glorious universe to visit those whom it inspired. 
If such is Pompeii, what was Athens? What 
scene was exhibited from the Acropolis, the Par- 
thenon, and the temples of Hercules, and Theseus 
and the Winds? The islands and the Aégean 
Sea, the mountains of Argolis, and the peaks of 
“ 162

PERCY BYSSHE SHELLEY 
  Pindus and Olympus, with the darkness of the 
Beotian forests interspersed? 
From the Forum we went to another public 
place, a triangular portico half enclosing the 
ruins of an enormous temple. It is built on the 
edge of the hill overlooking the sea. The black 
pomt is the temple. In the apex of the triangle 
stand an altar and a fountain, and before the 
altar once stood the statue of the builder of the 
portico, . 
Returning hence and following the consular 
road, we came to the eastern gate of the city. 
The walls are of enormous strength and inclose 
a space of three miles. On each side of the wall 
beyond the gate are built the tombs. How unlike 
ours! They seem not so much hiding-places for 
that which must decay as voluptuous chambers 
of immortal spirits. They are of marble radi- 
antly white; and two especially beautiful are 
loaded with exquisite bas-relief. On. the stucco 
wall that encloses them are little emblematie 
figures, of a relief exceedingly low, of dead and 
dying animals and little winged genii, and female 
forms bending in groups in some funereal office. 
The higher reliefs represent, one a nautical and 
the other a Bacchanalian one. Within the cell 
stand the crematory urns, sometimes one, some- 
times more. It.is said that paintings were found 
within; which are now, as has been everything 
movable in Pompeii, removed and scattered about 
in royal museums. These tombs were the most 
impressive things of all. The wild woods sur- — 
round them on either side; and along the broad 
stones of the paved road which divides them, 
you hear the late leaves of autumn shiver and

rustle in the stream of the inconstant wind, as 
it were like the steps of ghosts. The radiance 
and magnificence of these dwellings of the dead, 
the white freshness of the scarcely finished mar- 
ble, the impassioned or imaginative life of the 
figures which adorn them, contrast strangely with 
the simplicity of the houses of those who were 
living when Vesuvius overwhelmed them. 
I have forgotten the amphitheater, which is 
of great magnitude tho inferior to the Coliseum. 
T now understand why the Greeks were such 
great poets; and above all, I ean account, it 
seems to me, for the harmony, the unity, the 
perfection, the uniform excellence of all their 
works of art. They lived in a perpetual com- 
meree with external nature, and nourished them- 
selves upon the spirits of its forms. Their the- 
aters were all open to the mountains of the sky. 
Their columns, the ideal type of a sacred forest, 
with its roof of interwoven tracery, admitted the 
light and wind. The odor and the freshness of 
the country penetrated the cities. Their temples 
were mostly unparthaie; and the flying clouds, 
the stars and the deep sky were seen above. 
Oh, but for that series of wretched wars which 
terminated in the Roman conquest of the world; 
but for the Christian religion which put the 
finishing stroke on the ancient system; but for 
those changes that conducted Athens to its ruin

THE MUTILATION OF THE HERMZ' | 
Arter between two and three months of active 
preparations, the expedition® was almost ready 
to start, when an event happened which fatally 
poisoned the prevalent cheerfulness of the city. 
This was the mutilation of the Herma, one of the 
most extraordinary events in all Grecian history. 
The Herma, or half-statues of the god Hermes, 
were blocks of marble about the height. of the 
2¥rom Chapter LVIII of the “History of Greece.” Altho 
several histories of Greece have been written since Grote’s, 
his work “still remains in some respects the greatest,” says 
A. D. Lindsay, his latest editor. Grote, in a sense, stands 
to Greece as Gibbon to the Roman Empire. He depended 
mainly on the literary sources, archeology in his dey 
having done little to widen knowledge. His work. is there> 
fore defective in its earlier parts, but from the sixth cen- 
tury down, when the literary sources begin, he is “still 
almost as valuable as ever.”

human figure. The upper part was cut into a 
head, face, neck, and bust; the lower part was 
left as a quadrangular pillar, broad at the base, 
without arms, body, or legs, but with the sig- 
nificant mark of the male sex in front, They 
were distributed in great numbers throughout 
Athens, and always in the most conspicuous 
situations; standing beside the outer doors of 
private houses as well as of temples—near the 
most frequented porticoes—at the intersection of 
crossways-—in the public agora. They were thus 
present to the eye of every Athenian in all his 
acts of intereommunion, either for business or 
pleasure, with his fellow citizens. The religious 
feeling of the Greeks considered the god to be 
planted, or domiciliated, where his statue stood, 
so that. the companionship, sympathy, and guar- 
dianship of Hermes became associated with most 
of the manifestations of conjunct life at Athens, 
’ political, social, commercial, or gymnastic. More- 
over the quadrangular fashion of these statues, 
employed occasionally for other gods besides 
Hermes, was a most ancient relic handed down 
from the primitive rudeness of Pelasgian work- 
manship; and was popular in Arcadia, as well 
as peculiarly frequent in Athens. 
About the end of May 415 3.c., in the course 
of one and the same night, all these Herma, one 
of the most peculiar marks of the city, were 
mutilated by unknown hands. Their character- 
istic features were knocked off or leveled, so that 
nothing was left except a mass of stone with no 
resemblance to humanity or deity. All were thus 
_ dealt with in the same way, save and except 
very few; nay, Andocides affirms (and I incline 
166
-P-A-G-E-174
  GEORGE GROTE 
  to believe him) that there was but one whieh 
escaped unharmed. 
It is of course impossible for any one to sym- 
pathize fully with the feelings of a religion not 
his own; indeed, the sentiment with which, in the 
case of persons of different creed, each regards 
the strong emotions growing out of causes’ pecul- 
jar to the other—is usually one of surprize that 
such trifles and absurdities can occasion any, 
serious distress or excitement. But. if we take 
that reasonable pains, which is incumbent on 
those who study the history of Greece, to realize 
in our minds the religious and political associa- 
tions of the Athenians—noted in ancient times 
for their superior piety, as well as for, their 
aceuracy and magnificence about the visible mon- 
uments embodying that feeling—we shall in part 
comprehend the intensity of mingled dismay, 
terror, and wrath which beset the publie mind 
on the morning after this nocturnal sacrilege, 
alike unforeseen and unparalleled. Amidst all 
the ruin and impoverishment which had been 
inflicted by the Persian invasion of Attica, there 
was nothing which was so profoundly felt or so 
long remembered as the deliberate burning of 
the statues and temple of the gods. 
If we could imagine the excitement of a 
Spanish or Italian town, on finding that all the 
images of the Virgin had been defaced during the 
same night, we should have a parallel to -what 
was now felt at Athens—where religious associa- 
tions and persons were far more intimately allied 
with all civil acts and with all the proceedings 
of every-day life—where, too, the god and his 
efficiency were more forcibly localized, as well 
167

    THE BEST OF THE WORLD'S CLASSICS 
  as identified with the presence and keeping of 
the statue. To the Athenians, when they went 
forth on the following morning, each man seeing 
the divine guardian at his doorway dishonored 
and defaced, and each man gradually coming to 
know that the devastation was general—it would 
seem that the town had become, as it were, god- 
‘less—that the streets, the market-place, the por- 
ticoes were robbed of their divine protectors, 
and what was worse still, that these protectors, 
having been grossly insulted, carried away with 
them alienated sentiments—wrathful and vindic- 
tive instead of tutelary and sympathizing. It 
was on the protection of the gods that all their 
political constitution as well as the blessings 
of civil life depended; insomuch that the curses 
of the gods were habitually invoked as sanction 
and punishment for grave offenses, political as 
well as others; an extension and generalization 
of the feeling still attached to the judicial oath. 
This was, in the minds of the people of Athens, 
a sincere and literal conviction—not simply a 
form.of speech to be pronounced in prayers and 
‘public harangues, without being ever construed 
as a reality in caleulating consequences and de- 
termining practical measures. Accordingly, they 
drew from the mutilation of the Herm» the in- 
ference, not less natural than terrifying, that 
heavy publie misfortune was impending over the 
city, and that the political constitution to which 
they were attached was in imminent danger of 
being subverted. - . 
Such was the mysterious incident which broke 
in upon the eager and bustling movement of 
Atheng, a few days before the Sicilian expedition 
168
-P-A-G-E-176
  GEORGE GROTE. 
  
was starting. In reference to that expedition, 
it was taken to heart as a most depressing omen. 
It would doubtless have been so interpreted, had 
it been a mere undesigned accident happening 
to any venerated religious object—just as we are 
told that similar misgivings were occasioned by 
the oceurrence, about this same time, of the 
melancholy festival of the Adonia, wherein the 
women loudly bewailed the untimely death of 
Adonis. The mutilation of the Herme, however, 
was something much more ominous than the worst 
accident. It. proclaimed itself as the deliberate 
aet of organized conspirators, not ineonsiderable 
in number, whose names and final purpose were 
indeed unknown, but who had begun by com- 
mitting sacrilege of a character flagrant and 
unheard of. For intentional mutilation of a 
public and sacred statue, where the material 
afforded no temptation to plunder, is a ease to 
which we know no parallel: much’ more, mutila- 
tion by wholesale—spread by one band and in 
one night throughout an entire city. Tho neither 
the parties concerned, nor their purposes, were _ 
ever more than partially made out, the concert 
and conspiracy itself is unquestionable, Moy 
It seems probable, as far as we ean form an 
opinion, that the conspirators had two objects, 
perhaps some of them one and some the other: 
—to ruin Alcibiades *— to frustrate or delay the _ 
expedition. How they pursued the former pur- 
pose, will be presently seen: toward the latter, 
nothing was ostensibly done, but the position. of 
* Alcibiades was # leader of the party which had favored 
the expedition, and which prevailed at last over bitter op- 
position, 
169

  Teukrus and other metics implicated renders it 
more likely that they were influenced by sym- 
pathies with Corinth and Megara, prompting 
them to intercept an expedition which was sup- 
posed to promise great triumphs to Athens— 
rather than corrupted by the violent antipathies 
of intestine politics. ‘Indeed the two objects were 
intimately connected with each other; for the 
prosecution of the enterprise, while full of pros- 
pective conquest to Athens, was yet more preg- 
nant with future power and wealth to Alcibiades 
himself. Such chances would disappear if the 
expedition could be prevented; nor was it at all 
impossible that the Athenians, under the intense 
impression of religious terror consequent on the 
mutilation of the Herma, might throw up the 
seheme altogether. Especially Nicias, exquisitely 
sensitive in his own religious conscience, and 
never hearty in his wish for going (a fact per- 
fectly known to the enemy), would hasten to 
consult his prophets, and might reasonably be 
expected to renew his opposition on the fresh 
ground offered to him, or at least to claim delay 
until the offended gods should have been ap- 
peased. We may judge how much such a pro- 
ceeding was in the line of his character and of 
the Athenian character, when we find him, two 
years afterward, with the full concurrence of his 
soldiers, actually sacrificing the last opportunity 
of safe retreat for the half-ruined Athenian army 
in Sicily, and-refusing even to allow the prop- 
osition to be. debated, in consequence of an 
eclipse of the moon; and when we reflect that 
Greeks frequently renounced public designs if an 
‘earthquake happened before the execution. 
170

  GEORGE GROTE 
  But tho the chance of setting aside the expedi- 
tion altogether might reasonably enter into the 
plans of the conspirators, as a likely consequence 
of the intense shock inflicted onthe religious 
mind of Athens, and especially of Nicias—this 
ealeulation was not realized. Probably matters 
had already proceeded too far even for Nicias 
to reeede. Notice had been sent around to all 
the allies; forces were already on their way to the 
rendezvous at Coreyra; at Argeian and Man- 
tineian allies were arriving at Pireus to embark. 
So much the more eagerly did the conspirators. 
proceed in that which I have stated as the other 
part of their probable plan; to work that exag- 
gerated religious terror, which they had them- 
selves artificially brought about, for the ruin of 
Alcibiades. 
Few men in Athens either had, or deserved to 
have, a greater number of enemies, political as 
well as private, than Alcibiades; many of them 
being among the highest citizens, whom he of- 
fended by his insolence, and whose liturgies and 
other customary exhibitions he outshone by his 
reckless expenditure. His importance had been 
already so much increased, and threatened to be 
so much more increased, by the Sicilian enter- 
prise, that they no longer observed any measures 
in compassing his ruin, That which the mutila- 
tors of the Herme# seemed to have deliberately, 
planned his other enemies were ready to turn 
to profit.

If ALEXANDER HAD LIVED‘ 
Tua death of Alexander, thus suddenly cut 
off by a fever in the plenitude of health, vigor, 
and aspirations, was an event impressive as well 
as important in the highest possible degree, to 
his contemporaries far and near. When the first 
report of it was brought to Athens, the orator 
Demades exelaimed, ‘‘It can not be true: if 
Alexander were dead, the whole habitable world 
would have smelt of his eareass.’’ This coarse, 
but emphatic comparison, illustrates the imme- 
diate, powerful, and wide-reaching impression 
produced by the sudden extinetion of the great 
conqueror. It was felt by each of the many 
remote envoys who had so recently come to pro- 
pitiate this far-shooting Apollo—by every man 
among the nations who had sent these envoys— 
throughout Europe, Asia, and Africa, as then 
known—to affect either his actual condition or 
his probable future. 
The first growth and development of Macedo- 
nia, during the twenty- -two years preceding the 
battle of Charoneia,” from an embarrassed sec- 
ondary state inte the first of all known powers, 
‘Prom Chapter XOTV of the “History of Greece.” Alex- ander’s death, which took place at Babylon in 828 B.c., 
was due to a fever, which followed a. carouse and Iassted 
twelve days. 
5 This battle was. fought in 288 B.c, between Philip of 
Macedon, Alexander the Great's tether, and the combined 
forces of Bwotis and Athens.

  had excited the astonishment of contemporaries, 
and admiration for Philip’s organizing genius. 
But the achievements of Alexander, during his 
twelve years of reign, throwing Philip into the 
shade, had been on a scale so much grander and 
vaster, and so completely without serious reverse 
or even interruption, as to transcend the meas- 
ure, not only of human expectation, but. almost 
of human belief. The Great King (as the King 
of Persia was ealled by excellence) was, and had 
long been, the type of worldly power and felicity, 
even down to the time when Alexander crossed’ | 
the Hellespont. Within four years and three 
months from this event, by one stupendous defeat 
after another, Darius had lost all his Western . 
empire, and had become a fugitive eastward of 
the Caspian Gates, escaping captivity at the 
hands of Alexander only to perish by those of 
the satrap Bessus. All antecedent historical par- 
allels—the ruin and captivity of the Lydian Cro- 
sus, the expulsion and mean life of the Syracu- 
san Dionysius, both of them impressive examples 
of the mutability of human condition—sank into 
trifles compared with the overthrow of this tow- 
ering Persian colossus. The orator Auschines 
exprest the genuine sentiment of a Grecian spec- 
tator when he exclaimed (in a speech delivered 
at Athens shortly before the death of Darius), 
‘‘What is there among the list of strange and | 
unexpected events that has not occurred in our 
time? Our lives have transcended the limits of 
humanity; we are born to serve as a theme for 
ineredible tales to posterity. Is not the Persian 
King—who dug through Athos and bridged the 
Heliespont—who demanded earth and water from 
173

  the. Greeks—who dared to proclaim himself in 
publie epistles master of all mankind -from the 
rising to the setting sun—is not he now strug- 
gling to the last, not for dominion over others, 
but for the safety of his own person?’’ 
Such were the sentiments excited by Alexan- 
der’s career even in the middle of 330 B.c., more 
than seven years before his death. During the 
following seven years his additional achieve- 
ments had carried astonishment yet further. He 
had -mastered, in defiance of fatigue, hardship, 
and combat, not merely all the eastern half of 
the Persian empire, but unknown Indian regions 
beyond its easternmost limits. Besides Macedonia, 
Greece, and Thrace, he possest all that immense 
treasure and military force which had once. ren- 
derd the Great King so formidable. By no con- 
temporary man had any such power ever been 
known or conceived. With the turn of imagina- 
tion then prevalent, many were doubtless dis- 
posed to take him for a god on earth, as Grecian 
spectators had once supposed with .regard to 
Xerxes, when they beheld the innumerable Per- 
sian host crossing the Hellespont. 
Exalted to this prodigious grandeur, Alexander 
was at the time of his death little more than 
thirty-two years old—the age at which a citizen 
of Athens was growing into important com- 
mands; ten years less than the age for a consul 
at Rome; two years younger than the age at 
which Timour first acquired the crown, and began 
his foreign conquests. His extraordinary bodily 
powers were unabated; he had acquired a large 
- stock of military experience; and, what was still 
more important, his appetite for further conquest 
174 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
  GEORGE GROTE 
  was as voracious, and his readiness to purchase 
it at the largest cost of toil or danger as com- 
plete, as it had been when he first crossed the 
Hellespont. Great as his past eareer had been, 
his future achievements, with such increased 
means and experience, were likely to be yet 
greater. His ambition would have been satis- 
fied with nothing less than the conquest of the 
whole habitable world as then known; and if 
his life had been prolonged, he would probably 
have accomplished it. Nowhere (so far as our 
knowledge reaches) did there reside any military 
power capable of making head against him; nor 
were his soldiers, when he commanded them, 
daunted or bafiled by any extremity of cold, heat, 
or fatigue. The patriotic feelings of Livy dispose 
him to maintain that Alexander, had he invaded 
Italy and assailed Romans or Samnites, would 
have failed and perished like his relative Alex- 
ander of Epirus. But this eonelusion can not 
be accepted. If we grant the courage and dis- 
eipline of the Roman infantry to have been equal © 
to the best infantry of Alexander’s army, ‘the 
same ean not be said of the Roman cavalry as 
compared with the Macedonian companions. 
Still less is it likely that a Roman Consul, an- 
nually changed, would have been found a match 
for Alexander in military genius and combina- 
tions; nor, even if personally equal, would he 
have possest the same variety of troops and arms, 
each effective in its separate way, and all con- 
spiring to one common purpose—nor the same 
unbounded influence over their minds in stimu- 
lating them to full effort. I'do not think that 
even the Romans could have suceessfully resisted 
175

  Alexander ‘the Great; tho it is certain that he 
never throughout all’ his long marehes -éiéoun- 
tered such enemies as they, nor even such as 
Samnites and Lucanians—combining courage, pa- 
triotism, discipline, with effective arms both for 
defense and for close combat. 
Among all the qualities which go to constitute 
. the highest military excellence, either as a gen- 
eral or as a soldier, none was wanting in the 
character of Alexander. Together with his own 
chivalrous ‘courage—sometimes indeed both ex- 
eessive and unseasonable, so as to form the only 
military defect which ‘can fairly be imputed to 
him—we trace in all his operations the most 
eareful dispositions taken beforehand, vigilant 
precaution in guarding against possible reverse, 
and abundant resource in adapting himself to 
new ‘contingencies. Amidst constant success, 
these precautionary combinations were never dis- 
‘eontinued. His achievements are the earliest 
recorded evidence of scientific military organiza- 
tion on a large scale, and of its overwhelming 
effects.. Alexander overawes the imagination 
more than any other personage of antiquity, by 
the matchless development of all that constitutes 
effective foree—as an individual warrior, and as 
organizer and leader of armed masses; not mere- 
ly the blind impetuosity ascribed by Homer to 
Ares, but also the intelligent, methodized, and 
all-subduing compression which he personifies in 
Athene: But all his great qualities were fit for 
use only against enemies; in which category in- 
‘deed were numbered all mankind, known. and 
unknown, except those who. chose to submit to 
him. In his Indian campaigns, amidst tribes of

  utter strangers, we perceive that not only those 
who stand on their defense, but also those who 
abandon their property and flee to the mountains, 
are alike pursued and slaughtered. © 
Apart from the transcendent merits of ‘Alex 
ander as a soldier and a general, some authors 
give him credit for grand and beneficent. views 
on the subjeet of imperial government, and for 
intentions highly. favorable to the improvement 
of mankind. I see no ground for adopting this 
opinion. As far as we can venture to anticipate 
what would have been Alexander’s future, we 
see nothing in prospect except years of ever- 
repeated aggression and conquest, not to be eon- 
cluded until he had traversed and subjugated all 
the inhabited globe. The acquisition of universal 
dominion—coneeived not metaphorically, but lit- 
erally, and conceived with greater facility in 
consequence of the imperfect geographical knowl- 
edge of the time—was the master-passion of his 
soul. At the moment of his death, he was com- 
menecing fresh aggression in the ‘south against 
the Arabians, to an indefinite extent; while his 
vast projects against the western tribes i in Africa 
and Europe, as far as the Pillars of Hercules, 
were consigned in the orders and memoranda 
confidentially communicated to Kraterus. Italy, 
Gaul, and Spain would have been successively at- 
tacked and conquered; the enterprises proposed 
to him when in Bactria by the Chorasmian prince 
Pharasmanes, but postponed then until a more 
convenient season, would have been next taken 
up, and he would have marched from the Danube 
northward round the Euxine and Palus Mwotis®

against the Scythians and the tribes of the Cau- 
easus. There remained, moreover, the Asiatic re- 
gions east of the Hyphasis, which his soldiers 
had refused to enter upon, but which he certainly 
would have invaded at a future opportunity, were 
it only to efface the poignant humiliation of 
having been compelled to relinquish his pro- 
claimed purpose. Tho this sounds like romance 
and hyperbole, it was nothing more than the 
real insatiate aspiration of Alexander, who looked 
upon every new acquisition mainly as a capital 
for acquiring more. ‘‘You are a man like all of 
us, Alexander’’ (said the naked Indian to him), 
‘except that you abandon your home like a med- 
dlesome destroyer, to invade the most distant 
regions; enduring hardship yourself, and in- 
flicting hardship upon others.’? Now, how an 
émpire thus boundless and heterogeneous, such 
‘as no prince has ever yet realized, could have 
‘been administered with any superior advantages 
to subjects, it would be difficult to show. The 
mere task of acquiring and ‘maintaining — of 
keeping satraps and tribute-gatherers in authori- 
ty as well as in subordination—of suppressing 
resistances ever liable to recur in regions distant 
by months of march—would oceupy the whole 
life of a world-conqueror, without leaving any 
leisure for the improvements suited to peace and 
stability, if we give him credit for such purposes 
in theory. .

CHARLOTTE CORDAY? 
Never was Republic One and Indivisible at a 
lower ebb, Amid dim ferment, History specially 
notices one thing: in the lobby of the Maison de 
l’Intendance, where busy Deputies are-coming and 
going, @ young Lady with an aged valet, taking 
grave graceful leave of Deputy Barbaroux. She 
is of stately Norman figure: in her twenty-fifth 
year; of beautiful still countenance: her name 
is Charlotte Corday, heretofore styled D’Armans, 
while Nobility still was. Barbaroux has given 
her a note to Deputy Duperret,—him who once 
drew his sword in the effervescence. Apparently . 
she will to Paris on some errand? ‘She was 
a Republican before the Revolution, and never 
wanted energy.’’ A completeness, a decision is

in this fair female Figure: ‘‘By energy she means 
the spirit that will prompt one to sacrifice him- 
self for his ecountry.’? What if she, this fair 
young Charlotte, had emerged from her secluded 
stillness, suddenly like a Star; ecruel-lovely, with 
half-angelie, half-demonie splendor; to gleam 
for a moment, and in a moment be extinguished ; 
to be held in memory, so bright complete was 
she, through long centuries!—Quitting Cimmerian 
Coalitions without, and the dim-simmering: twen- 
ty-five million within, History will look fixedly 
at this one fair Apparition of a Charlotte Cor- 
day; will note whither Charlotte moves, how the 
little Life burns forth so radiant, then vanishes 
swallowed of the Night. 
With Barbaroux’s Note of Introduction, and 
slight stock of Inggage, we see Charlotte on Tues- 
day the 9th of July seated in the Caen Diligence, 
with a place-for Paris. None takes farewell of 
her, wishes her Good-journey: her Father will 
find a line left, signifying that she is gone to 
England, that he must’ pardon her, and -forget 
her. The drowsy Diligence lumbers along; amid 
drowsy talk of Politics, and praise of the Moun- 
tain; in which she mingles not: all night, all day, 
and again all night. On Thursday, not long be- 
fore noon, we are at the bridge of Neuilly; here 
is Paris with her thousand black domes, the goal 
and purpose of thy journey! Arrived at the 
Inn de la’ Providence in the Rue des Vieux 
Augustins, Charlotte demands a room; hastens 
to bed; sleeps all afternoon and night, till the 
morrow morning. 
On the morrow morning, she delivers her Note 
to Duperret.. It relates to certain Family Papers 
180

  which are in the Minister of the Interior’s hands; 
which a Nun at Caen, an old Convent friend of 
Charlotte’s, has need of; which Duperret shall 
assist her in getting: this then was Charlotte’s 
errand to Paris? She has finished this, in the 
course of Friday: — yet says nothing of re- 
turning She has seen and silently investigated 
several things. The Convention, in bodily reality, 
she has seen; what the Mountain is like. The 
living physiognomy of Marat ® she could not see; 
he is sick at present, and confined to home. 
About eight on the Saturday morning, she 
purchases a large sheath-knife in the Palais 
Royal; then straightway, in the Place des Vie- 
toires, takes a hackney-coach: ‘‘To the Rue de 
l’feeole de Médecine, No. 44.’’ It is the residence 
of the Citoyen.Marat!—The Citoyen Marat is 
ill, and cannot be seen; which seems to disappoint 
her much, Her business is with Marat, then? 
Hapless beautiful Charlotte; hapless squalid 
Marat! From Caen in the utmost West, from 
Neuchftel in the utmost East, they two are draw- 
ing nigh each other; they two have, very strange- 
ly, business together.—Charlotte, returning to her 
Inn, dispatches a short Note to Marat; signifying 
that she is from Caen, the seat of rebellion; that 
she desires earnestly to see him, and ‘‘will put 
it in his power to do France a great service.’’ 
No answer. -Charlotte writes another Note, still 
more pressing; sets out with it by coach, about 
seven in the evening, herself. Tired day-laborers 
?Jean Paul Marat, a physician, was the. most radical of 
the Jacobins and had been ao leader in the overthrow of 
the Girondists on June 2, 1793. He was assassinated by 
Charlotte Corday on July 13 of the same year.

  have again finished their Week; huge Paris is 
circling and simmering, manifold according to 
its vague wont; this one fair Figure has decision 
in it; drives straight,—toward a purpose. 
It is yellow July evening, we say, the 13th of 
the month; eve of the Bastille day,—when ‘‘M. 
Marat,’’ four years ago, in the crowd of the 
Pont Neuf, shrewdly required of that Besenval 
Hussar-party, which had such friendly dispositions, 
‘‘to dismount, and give up their arms, then’’; 
and became notable among Patriot men. Four 
years: what a road he has traveled:—and sits 
now, about half-past seven of the clock, stewing 
in slipper-bath; sore afflicted; ill of Revolution 
Fever,—of what other malady this History had 
rather not name. Excessively sick and worn, 
poor man: with precisely eleven-pence-half-penny 
of ready-money, in paper; with slipper-bath; 
strong three-footed stool for writing on, the 
while; and a squalid—-Washer-woman, one may. 
call her: that is his civie establishment in Med- 
ieal-School Street; thither and not elsewhither 
has his road led him. Not to the reign of 
Brotherhood and Perfect Felicity: yét surely on 
the way toward that?—Hark, a rap again! A 
-rousieal woman’s voice, refusing to be rejected: 
it is the Citeyenne who’ would do France a 
service. Marat, recognizing from within, cries, 
Admit her. Charlotte Corday is admitted. 
Citoyen ‘Marat, I am from Caen the seat of 
rebellion, and wished to speak with you.—Be 
seated, mon enfant. Now what are the Traitors 
' doing at Caen? What Deputies are at Caen ?— 
Charlotte names some Deputies. ‘‘Their heads shall fall within a fortnight,’’ eroaks the eager

  People’s-friend, clutching his tablets to write: 
Barbaroux, Pétion, writes he with: bare shrunk 
arm, turning aside in the bath: Pétion, and 
Louvet, and—Charlotte has drawn her knife from 
the sheath; plunges it with one sure stroke, into © 
the writer’s heart. ‘A mot chére amie (Help, 
dear) !’’ no more could the Death-choked say or 
shriek. The helpful Washer-woman running in— | 
there is no Friend of the People, or Friend of 
the Washer-woman, left; but his life with a 
groan gushes out, indignant, to the shades below! 
And so Marat, People’s-friend, is ended; the 
lone Stylites has got hurled down suddenly from 
his pillar—whitherward He that made him knows. 
Patriot Paris may sound triple and tenfold, in 
dole and wail; reechood by patriot France; and 
the Convention, ‘‘Chabot pale with terror, de- 
elaring that they are to be all assassinated,’? 
may decree him Pantheon Honors, Public Fu- 
neral, Mirabean’s dust making way for him; and 
Jacobin Societies, in lamentable oratory, summing 
up his character, parallel him to One, whom they 
think it honor to eall ‘‘the good Sans-culotte,’’— 
whom we name not here; also a Chapel may be 
made, for the urn that holds his Heart, in the © 
Place du Carrousel; and new-born children be 
named Marat; and Lago-di-Como Hawkers bake 
mountains of stuceo into unbeautiful Busts; and | 
David paint his Picture, or Death-Scene; and 
such other Apotheosis take place as the human 
genius, in these circumstances, can devise: but 
Marat returns no more to the light of this Sun. 
One sole cireumstance we have read with clear 
sympathy, in the old Moniteur Newspaper: how 
Marat’s Brother comes from Neuchatel to ask 
183
-P-A-G-E-191
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD'S CLASSICS 
  of the Convention, ‘‘that the deceased Jean-Paul 
Marat’s musket be given to him.’? For Marat 
too had a brother and natural affections; and 
was wrapped once in swaddling-clothes, and slept 
safe in a cradle like the rest of us. Ye ehildren 
of men!—A sister of his, they say, lives still to 
this day in Paris. 
As for Charlotte Corday, her work is accom- 
plished; the recompense of it is near and sure. 
The chére amie, and the neighbors of the house, 
flying at her, she ‘‘overturns some movables,’’ 
intrenches herself till the gendarmes arrive; then 
quietly surrenders; goes quietly to the Abbaye 
Prison: she alone quiet, all Paris sounding, in 
wonder, in rage or admiration, round her. Duper- 
ret is put in arrest, on account of her; his Papers 
sealed,—which may lead to consequences. Fau- 
ehet, in like manner; though Fauchet had not so 
much as heard of her. Charlotte, confronted with 
these two Deputies, praises the grave firmness of 
Duperret, censures the dejection of Fauchet. 
On Wednesday morning the thronged Palais 
de Justice and Revolutionary Tribunal can see - 
her face; beautiful and calm: she dates it 
*‘fourth day of the Preparation of Peace.’’. A 
strange murmur ran through the Hall, at sight 
of her; you could not say of what character. 
Tinville has his indictments and tape-papers: the 
eutler of the Palais Royal will testify that he 
sold her the sheath-knife; ‘‘All these details 
are néedless,’’ interrupted Charlotte; ‘‘it is I 
that killed Marat. 1? By whose instigation !— 
“By no one’s’? ‘‘What tempted you then?’’ 
‘His erimes, I killed one man,’’ added she, 
raising her volee extremely (extrémement), as 
184
-P-A-G-E-192
  THOMAS CARLYLE 
  they went on with their questions, ‘‘I killed one 
man to save a hundred thousand; a villain to 
save innocents; a savage wild-beast to. give repose 
to my country.. I was a Republican before the 
Revolution; I never wanted energy.’’ There is 
therefore nothing to be said. The. public gazes 
astonished: the hasty limners sketch her features, 
Charlotte not disapproving: the men of law. pro- 
ceed with their formalities. The doom is Death 
as a murderess. To her Advocate she gives 
thanks; in gentle phrase, in high-flown elassical 
spirit. To the Priest they send her she gives 
thanks; but needs not any shriving, any ghostly 
or other aid from him. . 
On this same evening, therefore, about half- 
past seven o’clock, from the gate of the. Con- 
eiergerie, to a City all on tip-toe, the fatal Cart 
issues; seated on it a fair young creature, sheeted 
in red smock of Murderess; so beautiful, serene, 
so full of life; journeying toward death,—alone 
amid the World. Many take off their hats, 
saluting reverently; for what heart but must be 
touched? Others growl and howl. Adam Lux, 
of Mentz, declares that she is greater than Bru- 
tus; that it were beautiful to die with her; the 
head of this young man seems turned. At the 
Place de la Révolution, the countenance of Char- 
lotte wears the.same still smile. The execu- 
tioners proceed to bind her feet; she resists, 
thinking it meant as an insult; on a word of 
explanation, she submits with cheerful’ apology. 
As the last act, all being now ready, they take 
the neckerchief from her neck, a blush of maid- 
enly shame overspreads her fair face and neck; 
the cheeks were still tinged with it when the 
185

  executioner lifted the severed head, to show it 
to the people. ‘‘It is most true,’’ says Forster, 
‘that he struck the cheek insultingly; for I saw 
it with my eyes; the Police imprisoned him 
for it.’’ , 
In this manner have the Beantifullest and the 
Squalidest come in collision, and extinguished 
one another. Jean-Paul Marat and Marie-Anne 
Charlotte Corday both, suddenly, are no more. 
“‘Day of the Preparation of Peace’’? Alas, how 
were peace possible or preparable, while for 
example, the hearts of lovely Maidens, in their 
convent-stillness, are dreaming not of Love- 
paradises and the light of Life, but of Codrus’s- 
sacrifices and Death well-earned? That twenty- 
five million hearts have got to such temper, this 
is the Anarchy; the soul of it lies in this, whereof 
: not peace can be the embodiment! The death

be worse than any life. O ye hapless Two, mu-

THE BLESSEDNESS OF WORK* 
For there is perennial nobleness, and’ even 
sacredness, in Work, were he never so benighted, 
forgetful of his high calling, there is always hope 
in a man that actually and earnestly works: in 
Tdleness alone is there perpetual despair. Wor! 
never so Mammonish, mean, és in communication 
with Nature; the real desire to get Work done 
will itself lead-one more and more to truth, to 
Nature ’s appointments and regulations, which are 
truth. 
The latest Gospel in this world is, Know thy 
work and do it. ‘(Know thyself’’: long enough 
has that poor ‘‘self’’ of thine tormented. thee; 
thou wilt never get to ‘‘know’’ it, I believe! 
Think it not thy business, this of knowing thy- 
self; thou art an unknowable individual: know 
what thou canst work at; and work at it like 
a Hercules! That will be thy better plan. 
It has been written, ‘‘An endless significance 
lies in Work’’; a man perfects himself by work- 
ing. Foul jungles are cleared away, fair seed- 
fields rise instead, and stately cities; and withal 
the man himself first ceases to be jungle and 
foul unwholesome desert thereby. Consider how 
even in the meanest sorts of Labor, the whole 
soul of a man is composed into a kind of real 
harmony the instant he sets himself to work! 
Doubt, Desire, Sorrow, Remorse, Indignation,

  Despair itself, all these like hell-dogs lie be- 
leaguering the soul of the poor day-worker, as 
of every man: but he bends himself with free 
valor against his task, and all these are stilled, 
all these shrink murmuring far off into their 
eaves, The man is now a man. The blessed 
glow of Labor in him, is it not as purifying fire, 
wherein all poison is burnt up, and of sour.smoke 
itself there is made bright blessed flame! 
Destiny, on the whole, has no other way of 
cultivating us. A formless Chaos, once set it 
revolving, grows round and ever rounder; ranges 
itself by mere force of gravity into strata, sphe- 
rieal courses; is no longer a Chaos, but a round 
compacted World. What would become of the 
Earth did she cease to revolve? In the poor 
old Earth, so long as she revolves, all inequalities, 
irregularities, disperse themselves; all i 
ties are incessantly becoming regular. Hast thou 
looked on the Potter’s wheel,—one of the ven- 
erablest objects; old as the Prophet Ezekiel and 
far older? Rude lumps of clay, how they spin 
themselves up, by mere quiek whirling, into beau- 
tiful circular dishes. And fancy the most assidu- 
ous Potter, but without his wheel; reduced to 
make dishes, or rather amorphous boteches, by 
mere kneading and’ baking! Even sueh a Potter 
were Destiny, with a human soul that would rest 
and lie at ease, that would not work and spin! 
Of an idle unrevolving man the kindest Destiny, 
like the most assiduous Potter without wheel, 
ean bake and knead nothing other than a boteh; 
Tet her spend on him what expensive coloring, 
what gilding and enameling she will, he is but 
a botch.. Not a dish; no, a bulging, kneaded,

boteh,—a mere enameled vessel of dishonor! Let 
the idle think of this. 
Blessed is he who has found his work; let him 
ask no other blessedness. He has a work, a life- 
purpose; he has found it, and will follow it! 
How, as a free-flowing channel, dug and torn 
by noble force through the sour mud-swamp of 
one’s existence, like an ever-deepening river 
there, it runs and flows;—draining off the ‘sour 
festering water gradually from the root of the 
remotest grass-blade; making, instead of pesti- 
Jential swamp, a green fruitful meadow with its 
clear-flowing stream. How blessed for the mead- 
ow itself, let the stream and its value be great 
or small! Labor is Life: from the inmost heart 
of the Worker rises his God-given Force, the 
sacred celestial Life-essenee breathed into him 
by Almighty God; from his inmost heart awakens 
him to all nobleness,—to ali knowledge, ‘‘self- 
knowledge’? and much else, so soon as Work 
fitly begins. Knowledge? ‘The knowledge that 
will hold good in working, cleave thou to that; 
for Nature herself accredits that, says Yea to 
that. Properly thou hast no other knowledge 
but what thou hast got by working: the rest is 
yet all a hypothesis of knowledge; a thing to be 
argued of in schools, a thing floating in the

Poor Cromwell,—great Cromwell! The inar-

Rude, confused, struggling to utter himself, with 
his savage depth, with his wild sincerity; and 
he looked so strange, among the elegant Eu- 
phemisms, dainty little Falklands, didactic Chil- 
lingworths, diplomatic Clarendons! Consider 
him. An outer hull of chaotie confusion, visions 
of the Devil, nervous dreams, almost semi-mad- 
ness; and yet such a clear determinate man’s- 
energy working in the heart of that. A kind of 
chaotic man. The ray as of pure starlight and 
fire, working in such an element of boundless 
hypochondria, unformed black of darkness! And 
yet withal this hypochoridria, what was it but 
the very greatness of the man? The depth and 
tenderness of his. wild affections: the quantity 
of sympathy he had ‘with things,—the quantity 
of insight he would yet get into the heart of 
things, the mastery he would yet get over things: 
this was his hypochondria. The man’s misery, 
as man’s misery always does, came of his great-

struggling to see. : 
On this ground, too, I explain to myself Crom- 
well’s reputed confusion of speech. To. himself 
the internal meaning was sun-clear;, but the 
material with which he was to elothe it in ut- 
terance was not there. He had lived. silent; 
a great unnamed sea of Thought round him all his 
days; and in his way of life little call to attempt 
naming or uttering that. With his sharp power 
of vision, resolute power of action, I doubt not he, 
could have learned to write Books withal, and 
speak fluently enough;—he did harder things 
than writing of Books. This kind of man is” 
precisely he who is fit for doing manfully all 
things you will set him on doing. Intellect is 
not speaking and logicizing; it is seeing and 
ascertaining. ‘Virtue, Vir-tus, manhood, hero- 
hood, is not fair-spoken immaculate regularity; 
it is first of all, what the Germans well name 
it, Tugend (Taugend, dow-ing, or Dough-tiness), 
Courage and the Faculty to do. This basis of 
the matter Cromwell had in him, 
One understands moreover how, tho he could 
not speak in Parliament, he might preach, rhap- 
sodic preaching; above all, how he might be great 
in extempore prayer. These are the free out- 
pouring utterances of what is in the heart: 
method is not required in them; warmth, depth, 
sineerity are all that is required. _Cromwell’s 
habit of prayer is a notable feature of him. Ali 
his great enterprises were commenced with 
prayer. In dark inextricable-looking difficulties, 
his Officers and he used to assemble, and pray 
alternately, for hours, for days, till some definite

  resolution rose among them, some ‘‘door of 
hope,’’ as they would name it, disclosed itself. 
Consider that. In tears, in fervent prayers, and 
eries to the great God, to have pity on them, to 
make His light shine before them. They, armed 
Soldiers of Christ, as they felt themselves to be; 
a little band of Christian Brothers, who had 
drawn the sword against a great black devouring 
world not Christian, but Mammonish, Devilish,— 
they cried to God in their straits, in their extreme 
need, not to forsake the Cause that was His. The 
light which now rose upon them,—how could 8 
human soul, by any means at all, get better 
light? Was not the purpose so formed like te 
be precisely the best, wisest, the one to be fol- 
lowed without hesitation any more? To them it 
was as the shining of Heaven’s own Splendor in 
. the waste-howling darkness; the Pillar of Fire 
by night, that was to guide them on their desolate 
perilous way. Was it not such? Can a man’s 
soul, to this hour, get guidance by any. other 
method than intrinsically by that same,—devout 
prostration of the earnest struggling soul before 
the Highest, the Giver of all Light; be such 
prayer a spoken, articulate, or be it a voiceless, 
Imartieulate' one? There is no other method. 
‘‘Hypoerisy?’’ One begins to be weary of all 
that. They who eall it so, have no right to speak 
on such matters. They never formed a purpose, 
what one can eall a'purpose. They went about 
balancing expédiencies, plausibilities; gathering 
votes, advices; they never were alone with the 
truth of a thing at all.—Cromwell’s prayers ‘were, 
‘likely to be ‘‘eloquent,’’ and much more than 
that. His was the heart of a man ‘who could pray. 
192
-P-A-G-E-200
  THOMAS CARLYLE 
  But indeed his actual Speeches, I apprehend, 
were not nearly so ineloquent, incondite, as they 
look. We find he was, what all speakers aim 
to be, an impressive speaker, even in Parliament; 
one who, from the first, had weight. With that 
rude passionate voice of his, he was always 
understood to mean something, and men wished 
to know what. He disregarded eloquence, nay 
despised and disliked it; spoke always without 
premeditation of the words he was to use. The 
Reporters, too, in those days seem to have been 
singularly candid; and to have given the Printer 
precisely what they have found on their own 
note-paper. And withal, what a strange proof 
is it of Cromwell’s being the premeditative ever- 
calculating hypocrite, acting a play before the 
world, that to the last he took no more charge 
of his Speeches! How came he not to study his 
words a little, before flinging them out to the 
public? If the words were true words, they could 
be left to shift for themselves. . 
But with regard to Cromwell’s ‘‘lying,’’ we 
will make one remark. This, I suppose, or some- 
thing like this, to have been the nature of it. 
All parties found themselves deceived in him; 
each party understood him to be meaning this, 
heard him even say so, and behold he turns-out 
to have been meaning that! He was, ery they, 
the chief of liars. But how, intrinsically, is not 
all this the inevitable fortune, not of a false man 
jn such times, but simply of a superior man? 
Such a man must have reticences in him. If he 
walk wearing his heart upon his sleeve for daws 
to peck at, his journey will not extend far!

abode in a house built of glass. A man always 
is to be himself the judge how much of his mind 
he will show to other men; even to those he 
would have work along with him. There are 
impertinent inquiries made: your rule is, to leave 
the inquirer uninformed on that matter; not, 
if you ean help it, misinformed, but precisely 
as dark as he was! 
This, could one hit the right phrase of re- 
sponse, is what the wise and faithful man would 
aim to answer in such a ease. 
Cromwell, no’ doubt of it, spoke often in the 
dialect of small subaltern parties; uttered to 
them a part of his mind. Hach little party 
thought him all its own. Hence their rage, one 
and all, to find him not of their party, but of 
his own party! Was it his blame? At all sea- 
sons of his history he must have felt, among 
such people, how if he explained to them the 
deeper insight he had, they must either have 
shuddered aghast at it, or believing it, their own 
little compact hypothesis must have gone wholly 
to wreck. They could not have worked in his 
province any more; nay perhaps they could not 
have now worked in their own province. It is 
the inevitable position of a great man among 
smail men. Small men, most active, useful, are 
to be seen everywhere, whose whole activity de- 
pends on some conviction which to you is pal- 
pably a limited one; imperfect, what we call 
an érror. But would it be a kindness always, 
is it a duty always or often, to disturb them 
in that? ‘Many a man, doing loud work in the 
world, stands only on some thin traditionality, 
conventionality to him indubitable, to you in-

  eredible: break that beneath him, he sinks to 
endless depths! ‘‘I might have my hand full 
of truth,’’ said Fontenelle, ‘‘and open only my 
little finger.’’ 
And if this be the fact even in matters of 
doctrine, how much more in all departments of 
practise! He that cannot withal keep his mind 
to himself cannot practise any considerable thing 
whatever. And we call it ‘‘dissimulation,’’ all 
this? What would you think of calling the gen- 
eral of an army a dissembler because he did not 
tell every corporal and private soldier who 
pleased to put the question, what his thouglits 
were about everything?—Cromwell, I should 
rather say, managed all this in a manner we 
must admire for its perfection. An endless vor- 
tex of such questioning ‘‘corporals’’ rolled eon- 
fusedly round him through his whole course; 
whom he did answer. It must have been as_a 
great true-seeing man that he managed this too. 
Not one proved falsehood, as I said;- not one! 
Of what man that ever wound himself through 
such a coil of things will you say so much? 
But in fact there are two errors widely prev- 
alent, which pervert to the very basis our judg- 
ments formed about such men as Cromwell; about 
their ‘‘ambition,’’ ‘‘falsity,’’ and suchlike. The 
first is what I might call substituting the goal 
of their career for the course and starting-point 
of it. The vulgar Historian of a Cromwell fan- 
cies that he had determined on being Protector 
of England, at the time when he was plowing 
the marsh lands of Cambridgeshire. His career 
lay all mapped-out: a program of the whole 
drama; which he then step by step dramatically 
195
-P-A-G-E-203
  
THE BEST OF THE WORLD'S CLASSICS 
  unfolded with all manner of cunning, deceptive 
dramaturgy, as he went on,—the hollow scheming 
Hypocrites, or Play-actor, that he was! This is 
a radical perversion; all but universal in such 
eases, And think for an instant how different 
the fact is! How much does one of us foresee 
of his own lifef Short way ahead of us it is 
all dim; an unwound skein of possibilities, of 
apprehensions, attemptabilities, vague-looming 
hopes. This Cromwell had not his life lying all 
in that fashion of Program, which he needed 
then, with that unfathomable eunning of his, 
only to enact dramatically, scene after scene! 
Not so. We see it so; but to him it was in no 
measure so. What absurdities would fall away 
of themselves, were this one undeniable fact kept 
honestly in view by History! Historians indeed 
will tell you that they do keep it in view;—but 
look whether such is practically the fact! Vulgar 
History, as in this Cromwell’s case, omits it 
altogether; even the best kinds of History only 
remember it now and then. To remember it duly 
with rigorous perfection, as in the fact it stood, 
requires indeed a rare faculty; rare, nay impos- 
sible. A very Shakespeare for faculty; or more 
than Shakespeare; who could enact a brother 
man’s biography, see with the brother man’s 
eyes at all points of his course what things he 
saw; in short, know his course and him, as few 
‘‘Historians’’ are like to do. Half or more of 
all the thick-piled perversions which distort our 
image of Cromwell, will disappear, if we hon- 
estly so.much as try to reprezent them so; in 
sequence, as they were; not in the lump, as they 
are thrown down before us. 
196
-P-A-G-E-204
  THOMAS CARLYLE 
  But a second error which I think the generality 
commit refers to this same ‘‘ambition’’ itself. 
We exaggerate the ambition of Great Men; we 
mistake what the nature of it is. Great Men 
are not ambitious in that sense; he is a small 
poor man that is ambitious so. Examine the man 
who lives in misery because he does not shine 
above other men; who goes about producing him- 
self, pruriently anxious about his gifts and 
claims; struggling to force everybody, as it were 
begging everybody for God’s sake, to acknowl- 
edge him a great man, and set him over the 
heads of men! Such a creature is among the 
wretchedest sights seen under this sun. A great 
man? <A poor morbid prurient empty man; fitter 
for the ward of a hospital than for a throne 
among men. I advise you to keep out of his 
way. He cannot walk on quiet paths; unless you 
will look at him, wonder at him, write paragraphs 
about him, he cannot live. It is the emptiness 
of the man, not his greatness. Because there is 
nothing in himself, he hungers and thirsts that 
you would find something in him. In good truth, 
I believe no great man, not so much as a genuine 
man who had health and real substance in him 
of whatever magnitude, was ever much tormented 
in this way. 
Your Cromwell, what good could it do him 
to be ‘‘noticed’’ by noisy crowds of people? 
God his Maker already noticed him. He, Crom- 
well, was already there; no notice would make 
him other than he already was. Till his hair was 
grown gray, and Life from the down-hill slope 
was all seen to be limited, not infinite but finite, 
and all a measurable matter how it went,—he 
197

  had been content to plow the ground, and read 
his Bible. He in his old days could not support 
it any longer, without selling himself to False- 
hood, that he might ride in gilt carriages to 
Whitehall, and have clerks with bundles of papers 
haunting him, ‘‘Deecide this, decide that,’’ which 
in utmost sorrow of heart no man ean perfectly 
decide! What could gilt carriages do for this 
man? From of old was there not in his life a 
weight of. meaning, a terror and a splendor as 
of Heaven itself? His existence there as man 
set him beyond the need of gilding. Death, Judg- 
ment, and Eternity: these already lay as the 
background of whatsoever he thought or did. 
All his: life lay begirt as in a sea of nameless 
Thoughts, which no speech of a mortal could 
name. God’s Word, as the Puritan prophets of 
that time had read it: this was great, and all 
else was little to him. To call sueh a man ‘‘ambi- 
tious,’’ to figure him as the prurient wind-bag 
described above, seems to me the poorest solecism. 
Such a man will say: ‘‘Keep your gilt carriages 
and huzzaing mobs, keep your red-tape clerks, 
your influentialities, your important businesses. 
Leave me alone, leave me alone; there is too 
much of life in me already!’’ Old Samuel John- 
son, the greatest soul in England in his day, was 
not ambitious. ‘‘Corsica Boswell’’ flaunted at 
public shows with printed ribbons round his hat; 
but the great old Samuel stayed at home. The 
world-wide soul, wrapt-up in its sorrows ;—what 
eould ribbons in the hat, do for it?

  But now, by way of counterpoise to this of 
Silence, let me say that there are two kinds of 
ambition: one wholly blamable, the other laudable 
and inevitable. Nature has provided that the 
great silent Samuel shall not be silent too long. 
The selfish wish to shine over others, let it be ac- 
eounted altogether poor and miserable. ‘‘Seekest 
thou great, things, seek them not’’: this is most 
trys!’ And’ ‘yet, I say, there is an irrepressible

not, you have two things to take into view. Not 
the eoveting of the place alone, but the fitness 
for the man of the place withal: that is the 
question. Perhaps the place was his, perhaps 
he had a natural right, and even obligation to 
seek the place! Mirabeau’s ambition to be Prime 
Minister, how shall we blame it, if he were ‘‘the 
only man in France that could have done any 
good there’’? Hopefuler perhaps had he not so 
clearly felt how much good he could do! But

Him who is seen toiling for the spiritually in- 
dispensable; not daily bread, but the bread of 
Life. Is not he too in his duty; endeavoring 
towards inward Harmony; revealing this, by act 
or by word, through all his outward endeavors, 
be they high or low? Highest of all, when his 
outward and his inward endeavor are one: when 
we can name him Artist; not earthly Crafts- 
man only, but inspired Thinker, who with 
heaven-made Implement conquers Heaven for 
us! If the poor and humble toil that we have 
Food, must not the high and glorious toil for

Parliaments and Courts of Westminster are 
venerable to me; how venerable; gray with a 
thousand years of honorable age! For a thou- 
sand years and more, Wisdom, and faithful 
Valor, struggling amid much Folly and greedy 
Baseness, not without most sad distortions in the 
struggle, have built them up; and they are as we 
see. For a thousand years, this English Nation 
has found them useful or supportable: they have 
served this English Nation’s wants; been a road 
to it through the abyss of Time. They are vener- 
able, they are great and strong. And yet it is 
good to remember always that they are not the 
venerablest, nor the greatest, nor the strongest! 
Acts of Parliament are venerable; but if they 
correspond not with the writing on the ‘‘Ada- 
mant Tablet,’? what are they? Properly their 
one element of venerableness, of strength of 
greatness, is, that they at all times correspond 
therewith as near as by human possibility they 
can. They are cherishing destruction in their

eddies and mad foam-oceans, where men and

ment for an unjust thing is sternly delayed, 
dost thou think that there is therefore no justice? 
It is what the fool hath said in his heart. It 
is what the wise, in all times, were wise be- 
cause they denied, and knew forever not 
to be. I tell thee again, there is nothing else 
but justice. One strong thing I find here 
below; the. just thing, the true thing. My 
friend, if thou hadst all the artillery of Wool- 
wich trundling at thy back in support of 
an unjust thing; and infinite bonfires visibly 
waiting ahead of thee, to blaze centuries long for 
thy victory on behalf of it,—I would advise thee 
to eall halt, to fling down thy baton, and say, 
‘*In God’s name, No!’’ Thy ‘‘suecess?’’ Poor 
devil, what will thy suecess amount to? If the 
thing is unjust, thou hast not succeeded; no, not 
tho bonfires blazed from North to South, and 
bells rang, and editors wrote leading-articles, 
and the just thing lay trampled out of sight, to 
all mortal eyes an abolished and annihilated 
thing. Success? In a few years thou wilt be 
dead and dark,—-all cold, eyeless, deaf; no blaze 
of bonfires, ding-dong of bells or leading-arti- 
eles visible or audible to thee again at all for- 
ever: What kind of success is that!

THE GREATNESS OF SCOTT’ 
Into the question whether Scott was a great 
man or not, we do not propose to enter deeply. 
It is, as too usual, a question about words. 
There can be no doubt but many men have been 
named and painted great who were vastly 
smaller than he, as little. doubt moreover that 
of the specially good a very large portion, accord- 
ing to any genuine standard of man’s worth, 
were worthless in comparison to him. He 
for whom Scott is great may most innocently 
name him so; may with advantage admire his 
great qualities, and ought with sincere heart to 
emulate him. At the same time, it is good that 
there be a certain degree of precision in our 
epithets. It is good to understand, for one 
thing, that no popularity, and open-mouthed 
wonder of all the world, continued even for a 
long series of years, can make a man great. Such 
popularity is a remarkable fortune; indicates a 
great adaptation of the man to his element of 
cireumstances; but may or may not indicate 
anything great in the man. To our imagination, 
as above hinted, there is a certain apotheosis 
in it; but in the reality no apotheosis at all. 
Popularity is as a blaze of ilumination, or 
alas, .of conflagration kindled round a man; 
showing what is in him; not putting the

tributed to the London and Westminster Review in 1838,

smallest item more into him; often ab- 
stracting much from him; conflagrating the 
poor man himself into ashes and caput mortuum! 
And then, by the nature of it, such popularity 
is transient; your ‘‘series of years,’’ quite un- 
expectedly, sometimes almost all on a sudden, 
terminates! For the stupidity of men, espe- 
cially of men congregated in masses round an 
object, is extreme. What illuminations and con- 
flagrations have kindled themselves, as if new, 
heavenly suns had risen, which proved only to 
be tar-barrels, and terrestrial locks of straw! 
Profane princesses cried out, ‘‘One God; one 
Farinelli!’’*—and whither now have they and 
Farinelli danced? In literature, too, there have 
been seen popularities greater even than Scott’s, 
and nothing perennial in the interior of them. 
Lope de Vega, whom all the world swore by, 
and made a proverb of; who could make a 
five-act tragedy in almost as many hours; the 
greatest of all popularities past or present, and 
perhaps one of the greatest men that ever ranked 
among popularities: Lope himself, so radiant, far- 
shining, has not proved to be a sun or star of 
the firmament; but is as good as lost and gone 
out, or plays at best, in the eyes of some few, as 
a vague aurora-borealis, and brilliant ineffectu- 
ality. 
The great man of Spain sat obscure at the 
time, all dark and poor, a maimed soldier; wri- 
ting his Don Quixote in prison. And Lope’s fate

roprano, whom Grove's “Dictionary” describes as “the most 
remarkable singer perhaps who has ever lived.” He was

  withal was sad, his popularity perhaps a curse to 
him; for in this man there was something ethe- 
real too, a divine particle traceable in few other 
popular men; and such farshining diffusion of 
himself, tho all the world swore by it, would do 
nothing for the true life of him even while he 
lived; he had to creep into a convent, into a 
monk’s cowl, and learn, with infinite sorrow, that 
his blessedness had lain elsewhere; that when a 
man’s life feels itself to. be sick and an error, no 
voting of by-standers can make it well and a 
truth again. 
Or coming down to our own times, was not 
August Kotzebue popular? Kotzebue, not so 
many years since, saw himself, if rumor and 
hand-clapping could be credited, the greatest man 
going; saw visibly his ‘‘Thoughts,’’ drest out in 
plush and pasteboard, permeating and peram- 
bulating civilized Europe; the most iron visages 
weeping with. him, in all theaters from Cadiz to 
Kamschatka; his own ‘‘astonishing genius,’’ 
meanwhile, producing two tragedies or so per 
month; he, on the whole, blazed high enough: he 
too has gone out into Night and Orcus, and al- 
ready is not. We will omit this of popularity 
altogether, and account it as making simply noth- 
ing toward Scott’s greatness or non-greatness, 
as an accident, not a quality. 
Shorn of this falsifying nimbus, and reduced 
to his own natural dimensions, there remains the 
reality, Walter Scott, and what we can find in 
him; to be accounted great, or not great, aceord- 
ing to the dialects of men. Friends to precision 
of epithet will probably deny his title to the 
name ‘‘great.’? It seems to us there goes other 
208

THOMAS CARLYLE 
  stuff to the making of great men than can be 
detected here. One knows not what idea worthy 
of the name of great, what purpose, instinct, or 
tendency, that eould be ealled great, Scott ever 
was inspired with. His life was worldly; his 
ambitions were worldly. There was nothing spir- 
itual in him; ali is economical, material of the 
earth earthy. A love of picturesque, of beau- 
tiful, vigorous and -graceful things; a genuine 
love, yet not more genuine than has dwelt in 
hundreds of men named minor poets: this is the 
highest quality to be discerned in him. His 
power of representing these things too, his poetic 
power, like his moral power, was a genius in 
eatenso, as We may say, not in intenso. In action, 
in speculation, broad as he was, he rose nowhere 
high; productive without measure as to quantity, 
in quality he for the most part transcended but 
a little way the region of commonplace. 
Tt has been said, ‘‘no man has written as many 
volumes with so few sentences that’ ean be 
quoted.’? Winged words were not his vocation; 
nothing urged him that way: the great mystery 
of existence was not great to him; did not drive 
him into rocky solitudes to wrestle with it for 
an answer, to be answered or to perish. He had 
nothing of the martyr; into no ‘‘dark region to 
slay monsters for us,’’ did he, either led or 
driven, venture down: his conquests were for his 
own behoof mainly, conquests over common mar- 
ket labor, and reckonable in good metallic coin , 
of the realm. The thing he had faith in, exeept 
power, power of what sort soever, and even of 
the rudest sort, would be diffieult to point out. 
One sees not that he believed in anything: nay, 
V—14 209
-P-A-G-E-217
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD'S CLASSICS 
  he did not even disbelieve; but quietly acqui- 
esced, and made himself at home in a world of 
conventionalities: the false, the semi-false, and 
the true were alike true in this that they were 
there, and had power in their hands more or less. 
It was well to feel so; and yet not well! We 
find it written, ‘‘Wo to them that are at ease 
in Zion’’; but surely it is a double wo to them 
that are at ease in Babel, in Domdaniel. On the 
other hand he wrote many volumes, amusing 
many thousands of men. Shall we eall this 
great? It seems to us there dwells and struggles 
another sort of spirit in the inward parts of 
great men! 
Yet on the other hand, the surliest critic must 
allow that Scott was a genuine man, which itself 
is a great matter. No affectation, fantasticality, 
or. distortion, dwelt in him; no shadow of cant. 
Nay, withal, was he not a right brave and strong 
man, according to his kind? What a load of 
toil, what a measure of felicity, he quietly bore 
along with him; with what quiet strength he 
both worked on this earth, and enjoyed in it; 
invincible to evil fortune and to good! A most 
eomposed invincible man; in difficulty and dis- 
tress, knowing no discouragement, Samson-like, 
carrying off on his strong Samson-shoulders the 
gates that would imprison him; in danger and 
menace, laughing at the whisper of fear. And 
then, with such a sunny current of true humor 
and humanity, a free Joyful. sympathy with so 
' many things; what of fire he had, all lying so 
beautifully latent, as radical latent heat, as fruit- 
ful internal warmth of life; a most robust, 
healthy man! The truth is, our best definition of

  Seott were perhaps even this, that he was, if no 
great man, then something much pleasanter to 
be, a robust, thoroughly healthy, and withal, very 
prosperous and victorious man. An eminently 
well-conditioned man, healthy in body, healthy in 
soul; we will call him one of the healthiest of 
men. Neither is this a small matter: health is 
a great matter, both to the possessor of it and 
to others. . . . 
Seott’s career, of writing impromptu novels to 
buy farms with, was not of a kind to terminate 
voluntarily, but to accelerate itself more and 
more; and one sees not to what wise goal it could, 
in any case, have led him. Bookseller Con- 
stable’s bankruptey was not the ruin of Scott; 
his ruin was that ambition, and even false ambi- 
tion, had laid hold of him; that his way of life 
was not wise. Whither could it lead? Where 
could it stop? New farms there remained ever 
to be bought, while new novels could pay for 
them. More and more success but gave more 
and more appetite, more and more audacity. The 
impromptu writing must have waxed ever 
thinner; declined faster and faster into the ques- 
tionable category, into the condemnable, into the 
general condemned. 
Already there existed, in secret, everywhere a 
considerable opposition party; witnesses of the 
Waverly miracles, unable to believe in them, but 
foreed silently to protest against them. Such 
opposition party was in the sure case to grow; 
and even, with the impromptu process ever going 
on, ever waxing thinner, to draw the world over 
to it. Silent protest must at length come to 
words; harsh truths, backed by harsher facts of

  a world-popularity over-wrought and worn out, 
behoved to have been spoken;—such as ean be 
spoken now without reluctance when they can 
pain the brave man’s heart no more. Who 
knows? Perhaps it was better ordered to be all 
otherwise. Otherwise, at any rate, it was. One 
day the Constable mountain, which seemed to 
stand strongly like the other rock mountains, 
gave suddenly, as the icebergs do, a loud- 
sounding erack; suddenly with huge clangor, 
shivered itself into ice-dust; and sank, earrying 
much along with it. In one day Scott’s high- 
heaped money-wages became fairy-money and 
nonentity; in one day the rich man and lord of 
land saw himself penniless, landless, a bankrupt 
among creditors. 
It was a hard trial. He met it proudly, bravely 
~—like a brave proud man of the world. Perhaps 
there had been a prouder way still; to have 
owned honestly that he was unsuccessful then, 
all bankrupt, broken, in the world’s goods and 
repute; and to have turned elsewhither for some 
refuge. Refuge did lie elsewhere; but it was not 
Scott’s course, or fashion of mind, to seek it 
there. To say: hitherto I have been all in the 
wrong, and this my fame and pride, now broken, 
was an empty delusion and spell of accursed 
witchcraft! It was difficult for flesh and blood! 
He said, I will retrieve myself, and make my 
point good yet, or die for it. Silently, like a 
proud strong man, he-girt himself to the Hercules 
task of removing rubbish-mountains, since that 
was it; of paying large ransoms by what he could 
still write and sell. In his declining years too; 
misfortune is doubly and trebly unfortunate that

befalls us then. Scott fell to his Hercules’ task 
like a very man, and went on with it unwearied- 
ly; with a noble cheerfulness, while his life- 
strings were cracking, he grappled with it, and 
wrestled with it, years long, in death-grips, 
strength to strength; and it proved the stronger ; 
and his life and heart did crack and break; the 
eordage of a most strong heart! Over these last 
writings of Scott, his Napoleons, Demonologies, 
Scotch Histories, and the rest, eriticism, finding 
still much to wonder at, much to commend, will 
utter no word of blame, this one word only, Wo 
is me! The noble warhorse that once laughed 
at the shaking of the spear, how is he doomed 
to toil himself dead, dragging ignoble wheels! 
Seott’s descent was like that of a spent projec 
tile; rapid, straight down; perhaps mercifully so. 
It is a tragedy, as all life is; one proof more 
that Fortune stands on a restless globe; that 
Ambition never yet profited any man. . . - 
And so the curtain falls; and the strong Wal- 
ter Scott is with us no more. A possession from 
him does remain; widely scattered; yet attain- 
able; not inconsiderable. It can be said of him, 
‘©When he departed he took a Man’s life along 
with him.’’ No sounder piece of British manhood 
was put together in that eighteenth century of 
time. Alas, his fine Scotch face, with its shaggy 
honesty, sagacity, and goodness, when we saw 
it latterly on the Edinburgh streets, was all worn 
with eare, the joy all fled from it; plowed 
with labor and sorrow. We shall never forget 
it; we shall never see it again. Adieu, Sir Wal- 
ter, pride of all Scotchmen, take our proud and 
sad farewell.

BOSWELL AND HIS BOOK‘ 
‘We have next a word to say of James Boswell. 
Boswell has already been much commented upon; 
but rather in the way of censure and vitupera- 
tion than of true recognition. He was a man 
that brought himself much before the world; 
eonfest that he eagerly coveted fame, or if that 
were not possible, notoriety; of which latter, as 
he gained far more than seemed his due, the 
public were incited, not only by their natural love 
of scandal, but by a special ground of envy, to 
say whatever ill of him could be said. Out of 
the fifteen millions that then lived, and had bed 
and beard, in the British Islands, this man has 
provided us a greater pleasure than any other 
individual, at whose cost we now enjoy ourselves; 
perhaps has done us a greater service than ean 
be specially attributed to more than two or 
three: yet, ungrateful that we are, no written or 
spoken eulogy of James Boswell anywhere exists; 
his recompense in solid pudding (so far as copy- 
right went) was not excessive; and as for the 
empty praise, it has altogether been denied him. 
Men are unwiser than children; they do not know 
the hand that feeds. 
Boswell was a person whose mean or bad quali- 
ties lay open to the general eye; visible, palpable 
to the dullest. His good qualities again, belonged

  not to the time he lived in; were far from common 
then, indeed, in such a degree, were almost un- 
exampled; not recognizable therefore by every 
one; nay, apt even (so strange had they grown) 
to be confined with the very vices they lay con- 
tiguous to, and had sprung out of. That he was 
a wine-bibler and gross liver; gluttonously fond 
of whatever would yield him a little solacement, 
were it only of a stomachic character, is un- 
deniable enough. That he was vain, heedless, a 
babbler; had much of the sycophant, alternating 
with the braggadocio, curiously spieed too with 
an all-pervading dash of the coxcomb; that he 
gloried much when the Tailor, by a court-suit, 
had made a new man of him; that he appeared 
at the Shakespeare Jubilee with a riband, im- 
printed ‘‘Corsica Boswell,’’ round his hat; and 
in short, if you will, lived no day of his life 
without doing and saying more than one preten- 
tious inaptitude; all this unhappily is evident as 
the sun at noon. The very look of Boswell seems 
to have signified so much. In that cocked nose, 
cocked partly in triumph over his weaker fellow- 
creatures, partly to snuff up the smell of coming 
pleasure, and scent it from afar; in those bag- 
cheeks, hanging like half-filled wine-skins, still 
able to contain more; in that coarsely protruded 
shelf mouth, that fat dewlapped chin; in all this, | 
who sees not sensuality, pretension, boisterous im- 
becility enough; much that could not have been 
ornamental in the temper of a great man’s over- 
fed great man (what the Scotch name flunky), 
though it had been more natural there. The 
under part of Boswell’s face is of a low, almost 
brutish character.

  And now behold the worthy Bozzy, so pre- 
possessed and held back by nature and by art, 
fly nevertheless like iron to its magnet, whither 
his better genius called! You may surround the 
iron and the magnet with what enclosures and 
encumbrances you please-—with wood, with rub- 
‘bish, with brass: it matters not, the two feel 
each other, they struggle restlessly toward each 
other, they will be together. The iron may be 
a Seottish squirelet, full of gulosity and ‘‘gig- 
manity’’; the magnet an English plebeian, and 
moving rag-and-dust mountain, coarse, proud, 
irascible, imperious; nevertheless, behold how 
they embrace, and inseparably cleave to one an- 
other! It is one of the strangest phenomena of 
the past century, that at a time when the old 
reverent feeling of Discipleship (such as brought 
men from far countries, with rich gifts, and 
prostrate soul, to the feet of the Prophets) had 
passed utterly away from men’s practical experi- 
ence, was no longer surmised to exist, (as it does,) 
perennial, indestructible, in man’s inmost heart, 
—James Boswell should have been the individual, 
of all others, predestined to recall it, in such 
singular guise, to the wondering, and, for a long 
while, laughing, and unrecognising world. It has 
been commonly said, The man’s vulgar vanity 
was all that attached him to Johnson; he de- 
lighted to be seen near him, to be thought con- 
nected with him. Now let it be at once granted 
that no consideration springing out of vulgar 
vanity could well be absent from the mind of 
James Boswell, in this his intercourse with John- 
son, or in any considerable transaction of his 
life, 
216
-P-A-G-E-224
  THOMAS CARLYLE 
  At the same time ask yourself: Whether such 
vanity, and nothing else, actuated him therein; 
whether this was the true essence and moving 
principle of the phenomenon, or not. rather its 
outward vesture, and the accidental environment 
{and defacement) in which it came to light? The 
man. was, by nature and habit, vain; a syeophant- 
coxeomb, be it granted; but had there been noth- 
ing more than vanity in him, was Samuel John- 
son the man of men to whom he must attach 
himself? At the date when Johnson was a poor 
rusty-coated ‘‘scholar’’ dwelling in Temple-lane, 
and indeed throughout their whole intercourse 
afterwards, were there not chancellors and prime 
ministers enough; graceful gentlemen, the glass 
of fashion; honor-giving noblemen; dinner giving 
rich men; renowned fire-eaters, swordsmen, 
gownsmen; Quacks and Realities of all hues,— 
any one of whom bulked much larger in the 
world’s eye than Johnson ever did? To any one 
of whom, by half that submissiveness and assidu- 
ity, our Bozzy might have recommended himself; 
and sat there, the envy of surrounding lickspit- 
tles; pocketing now solid emolument, swallowing 
now well-cooked viands and wines of rich vin- 
tage; in each ease, also, shone on by some glit- 
tering reflex of Renown or Notoriety, so as to be 
the observed of innumerable observers. To no 
one of whom, however, though otherwise a most 
diligent solicitor and purveyor, did he so attach 
himself: such vulgar courtierships were his paid 
drudgery, or leisure-amusement; the worship of 
Johnson was his grand, ideal, voluntary business. 
Dees not the frothy-hearted yet enthusiastic man,

  and hurry up to London, for the sake of his Sage 
chiefly; as to a Feast of Tabernacles, the Sabbath 
of his whole year? The plate-licker and wine- 
bibler dives into Bolt Court, to sip muddy coffee 
with a cynical old man, and a sour-tempered 
blind old woman (feeling the cups, whether they 
are full, with her finger) and patiently endured 
contradictions without end; too happy so he may 
but be allowed to listen and live. Nay, it does 
not appear that vulgar vanity could ever have 
been much flattered by Boswell’s relation to John- 
son, 
Mr. Croker says Johnson was, to the last, 
little regarded by the great world; from which, 
for a vulgar vanity, all honor, as from its foun- 
tain, descends. ozzy, even among Johnson’s 
friends, and special admirers, seems rather to 
Have been laughed at than envied; his officious, 
whisking, consequential ways, the daily reproofs 
and rebuffs he underwent, could gain from the 
world no golden, but only leaden, opinions. His 
devout Discipleship seemed nothing more than a 
mean Spanielship, in the general eye. His mighty 
**eonstellation,’’ or sun, round whom he, as satel- 
lite, observantly gyrated, was, for the mass of 
men, but a huge, ill-snuffed tallow-light, and he 
a weak night-moth, circling foolishly, dangerous- 
ly about it, not knowing what he wanted. If he 
enjoyed Highland dinners and toasts, as hench- 
man to a new sort of chieftain, Henry Erskine, 
in the domestie ‘‘Outer-House,’’ could hand him 
a shilling ‘‘for the sight of his Bear.’’ Doubtless 
the man was laughed at, and often heard himself 
laughed at for his Johnsonism. To be envied, 
is the grand. and sole aim of vulgar vanity; to

  be filled with good things is that of sensuality; 
for Johnson perhaps no man living envied poor 
Bozzy; and of good things (except himself paid 
for them) there was no vestige in that aequaint- 
anceship. Had nothing other or better than 
vanity and sensuality been there, Johnson and 
Boswell had never come together, or had soon 
and finally separated again. . . . 
Consider, too, with what force, diligence, and 
vivacity, he has rendered back, all this which, in 
Johnson’s neighborhood, his ‘‘open sense’’ had 
so eagerly and freely taken in. That loose- 
flowing, careless-looking Work of his is as a 
picture by one of Nature’s own Artists; the best 
possible resemblance of a Reality; like the very 
image thereof in a clear mirror. Which indeed 
it was; let but the mirror be clear, this is the 
great point; the picture must and will be genu- 
ine. How the babbling Bozzy, inspired only by 
Love, and the recognition and vision which love 
ean lend, epitomizes nightly the words of Wis- 
dom, the deeds and aspects of Wisdom, and so, 
by little and little, unconsciously works together 
for us a whole Johnsoniad; a more free, perfect, 
sunlit, and spirit-speaking likeness, than for 
many centuries had been drawn by man of man! 
Searcely since the days of Homer has the feat 
been equaled; indeed, in many senses this also is 
a kind of Heroic Poem. The fit Odyssey of our 
unhercie age was to be written, not sung; of 
a Thinker, not a Fighter; and (for want of a 
Homer) by the first open soul that might offer,— 
looked such even through the organs of a Bos- 
well. We do the man’s intellectual endowments

  outcome; though here, too, there'is not wanting 
a light ingenuity, a figurativeness, and fanciful 
sport, with glimpses of insight far deeper than 
the common. But Boswell’s grand intellectual 
talent was (as such ever is) an unconscious one, 
of far higher reach and significance than Logic; 
and showed itself in the whole, not in parts. 
Here again we have that old. saying verified, 
‘The heart sees farther than the head.’’ 
Thus does poor Bozzy stand out-to us as an 
ill-assorted, glaring mixture of the highest and 
the lowest. What, indeed is man’s life generally 
but a kind of beast-godhead; the god in us tri- 
umphing more and more over the beast; striving 
more and more to subdue it under his feet? Did 
not the Ancients, in their wise, perennially sig- 
nificant way, figure Nature itself, their sacred 
All, or Pan, as a portentous commingling of these 
two discords; as musical, humane, oracular in its 
upper part, yet ending below in the cloven hairy 
feet of a goat? The union of melodions, celestial 
Freewill and Reason, with foul Irrationality and

unspeakable Fear and half-mad panic Awe; as 
for mortals there well might! And is not man a 
microcosm, or epitomized mirror of that same 
Universe; or, rather, is not that Universe even 
Himself, the reflex of his own fearful and won- 
derful being, ‘‘the waste fantasy of his own 
dream???’ No wonder that man, that each man, 
and James Boswell like the others, should re- 
semble it! The peculiarity in his case was the 
unusual defect of amalgamation and subordina- 
tion: the highest lay side by side with the lowest; 
not morally combined with it and spiritually

  transfiguring it; but tumbling in half-mechanical 
juxtaposition with it, and from time to time, as 
the mad alternation chanced, irradiating it, or 
eclipsed by it. . . . 
As for the Book itself, questionless the univer- 
sal favor entertained for it is well merited. In 
worth as a Book we have rated it beyond any 
other product of the eighteenth century; all 
Johnson’s own Writings, laborious and in their 
kind genuine above most, stand on a quite inferior 
level to it; already, indeed, they are becoming 
obsolete for this generation; and for some future 
generations, may be valuable chiefly as Prolego- 
mena and Expository Scholia to this Johnsoniad 
of Boswell. Which of us but remembers, as one 
of the sunny spots in his existence, the day when 
he opened these airy volumes, fascinating him by 
a true natural-magic! It was as if the curtains 
of the Past were drawn aside, and we looked 
mysteriously into a kindred country, where dwelt 
our Fathers; inexpressibly dear to us, but which 
had seemed forever hidden from our eyes. For 
the dead Night had engulfed it; all was gone, 
vanished as if it had not been. Nevertheless, 
wondrously given back to us, there once more it 
lay; all bright, lucid, blooming; a little island 
of Creation amid the cireumambient Void. There 
it still lies; like a thing stationary, imperishable, 
over which changeful Time were now aceumu- 
lating itself in vain, and could not, any longer, 
harm it, or hide it. 
Thus for Boswell’s Life of Johnson has Time 
done, is Time still doing, what no ornament of 
Art or Artifice could have done for it. Rough 
Samuel and sleek wheedling James were, and

ment kas melted into air. The Mitre Tavern still 
stands in Fleet Street; but where now is its 
scot-and-lot paying, beef-and-ale loving, cocked- 
hatted, potbellied Landlord; its rosy-faced, as- 
siduous Landlady, with all her shining brass- 
pans, waxed tables, well-filled larder-shelves; her 
cooks, and bootjacks, and errand-boys, and 
watery-mouthed hangers-on? Gone! Gone! The 
becking waiter, that with wreathed smiles, wont 
to spread for Samuel and Bozzy their ‘‘supper 
of the gods,’’ has long since pocketed his last 
sixpence; and vanished, sixpence and all, like a 
ghost at cock-crowing. The Bottles they drank 
out of are all broken, the Chairs they sat on all 
rotted and burnt; the very Knives and Forks 
they ate with have rusted to the heart, and be- 
come brown oxide of iron, and mingled with the 
indiscriminate clay. All, all, has vanished; in 
very deed and truth, like that baseless fabrie of 
Prospero’s air-vision. Of the Mitre Tavern noth- 
ing but the bare walls remain there; of London, 
of England, of the World, nothing but the bare 
walls remain; and these also decaying, (were 
they of adamant,) only slower. The mysterious 
River of Existence rushes on: a new Billow 
thereof has arrived, and lashes wildly as ever 
round the old embankments; but the former Bil- 
low with its loud, mad eddyings, where is it?— 
Where? — Now this Book of Boswell’s, this is 
precisely a Revocation of the Edict of Destiny;

MIGHT BURNS HAVE BEEN SAVED” 
ContempLatine this sad end of Burns and how 
he sank unaided by any real help, uncheered by 
any wise sympathy, generous minds have some- 
times figured to themselves, with a reproachful sor- 
row, that much might have been done for him— 
that by counsel, true affection, and friendly min- 
istrations, he might have been saved to himself 
and the world. We question whether there is not 
more tenderness of heart than soundness of judg- 
ment in these suggestions. It seems dubious to 
us whether the richest, wisest, most benevolent 
individual could have lent Burns any effectual 
help. Counsel, which seldom profits any one, he 
did not need: in his understanding he knew right 
from wrong as well perhaps as any man ever 
did; but the persuasion, which would have 
availed him, lies not so much in the head as in

Review in 1828. “

the heart, where no argument or ‘expostulation 
could have assisted much to implant it, As to 
money, again, we do not really believe that this 
was his essential want, or well see how any pri- 
vate man could, even presupposing Burns’s con- 
sent, have bestowed on him an independent for- 
tune, with much prospect of decisive advantage. 
It is a mortifying truth, that two men in any 
rank of society could hardly be found virtuous 
enough to give money, and to take it as a neees- 
sary gift, without injury to the moral entireness 
of one or both. But so stands the fact: friend- 
ship, in the old heroie sense of that term, no 
longer exists, except in the cases of kindred or 
other legal affinity; it is in reality no longer ex- 
pected or recognized as a virtue among men. A 
close observer of manners has pronounced ‘‘pat- 
ronage,’’ that is pecuniary or other economic 
furtheranee, to be ‘‘twice cursed,’’ cursing him 
that gives and him that takes!: And thus in 
regard to outward matters also, it has become 
the rule, as in regard to inward it always was 
and must be the rule, that no one shall look for 
effectual help to another, but that each shall rest 
contented with what help he can afford himself. 
Such, we say, is the principle of modern honor— 
naturally enough growing out of that sentiment 
of pride which we inculcate and encourage as the 
basis of our whole social morality. Many a poet 
has been poorer than Burns, but no one was ever 
prouder: we may question whether, without great 
precautions, even a pension from royalty would 
not have galled and encumbered more than aetu- 
ally assisted him. 
Still less, therefore, are we disposed to join 
224
-P-A-G-E-232
  THOMAS CARLYLE 
  with another class of Burns’s admirers, who ac- 
euse the higher ranks among us of having ruined « 
Burns by their selfish neglect of him. We have 
already stated our doubts whether direct pecu- 
niary help, had it been offered, would have been 
accepted, or could have proved very effectual. 
We shall readily admit, however, that much was 
to be done for Burns; that many a poisoned ar- 
row might have been warded from his bosom; 
many an entanglement in his path cut asunder 
by the hand of the powerful; and light and heat 
shed on him from high places would have made 
his humble atmosphere more genial; and . the 
softest heart then breathing might have lived 
and died with some fewer pangs. Nay, we shall 
grant further, and for Burns, it is granting much, 
that with all his pride he would have thanked, 
even with exaggerated gratitude, any one who 
had cordially befriended him: patronage, unless 
onee cursed, needed not to have been twice se. 
At all events, the poor promotion he desired in 
his ealling might have been granted: it was his 
own scheme, therefore, likelier than any other to 
be of service. All this it might have been a 
luxury—nay, it was a duty, for our nobility to 
have done. No part of all this, however, did any 
of them do or apparently attempt, or wish to do: 
so much is granted against them. 
But what then is the amount of their blame? 
Simply that they were men of the world, and 
walked by the prineiples of such men; that they 
treated Burns as other nobles and other com- 
moners had done other poets; as the English did 
Shakespeare; as King Charles and his cavaliers 
did Butler; as King Philip and. his Grandees did

  Cervantes. Do men gather: grapes of thorns? or 
shall we eut down our thorns for yielding only 
a fence and haws? How indeed, could the ‘‘no- 
bility and gentry of his native land’’ hold out 
any help to this ‘‘Scottish bard, proud of his 
name and country’’? Were the nobility and gen- 
try so much as able rightly to help themselves? 
Had they not their. game to preserve, their bor- 
ough interests to strengthen; dinner, therefore, 
of various kinds, to eat and give? Were their 
means more than adequate to all this business, 
or less than adequate? Less than adequate in 
general: few of them in reality were richer than 
Burns; many of them were poorer: for sometimes 
they had to wring their supplies, as with thumb- 
screws, from the hard hand, and, in their need of 
guineas, to forget their duty of mercy, which 
Burns was never reduced to do. Let us pity and 
forgive them. The game they preserved and 
shot, the dinners they ate and gave, the borough 
interests they strengthened, the little Babylon 
- they severally builded by the glory of their 
might, are all melted, or melting back into the 
primeval chaos, as man’s merely selfish endeavors 
are fated to do: and here was an action ex- 
tending, in virtue of its worldly influence, we 
amay say, through all time—in virtue of its moral 
nature, beyond all time, being immortal as the 
Spirit of Goodness itself: this action was offered 
them to do, and light was not given them to do 
it. Let ‘us pity and forgive them. But, better 
than pity, let us go and do otherwise. Human 
suffering did not end with the life of Burns; 
neither was the solemn mandate, ‘‘Love one an- 
other, bear one another’s burdens,’’ given to the 
226

  rich only, but to all men. True, we shall find no 
Burns to relieve, to assuage by our aid or pity: 
but celestial natures, groaning under the fardels 
of a weary life, we shall still find; and that 
wretchedness which Fate has rendered. voiceless 
and tuneless, is not the least wretched, but the 
most. 
Still we do not think that the blame of Burns’s 
failure lies chiefly with the world. The world, 
it seems to us, treated him with more, rather 
than with less kindness, than it usually shows to 
such men. It has ever, we fear, shown but small 
favor to its teachers: hunger and nakedness, per- 
ils and reviling, the prison, the cross, the poison- 
chalice, have in most times and countries, been 
the market-place it has offered for wisdom, the 
welcome with which it has greeted those who 
have come to enlighten and purify it. Homer 
and Soerates and the Christian apostles belong to 
old days, but the world’s martyrology was not 
completed with these. Roger Bacon and Galileo 
languish in priestly dungeons, Tasso pines in the 
cell of a madhouse, Camoens dies begging on the 
streets of Lisbon. So neglected, so ‘‘ persecuted 
they the prophets,’’ not in Judea only, but in all 
places. where men have been. We reckon that 
every poet of Burns’s order is, or should be, a | 
prophet and teacher to his age—that he has no 
right therefore, to expect great kindness from it, 
but rather is bound to do it great kindness—that 
Burns, in particular, experienced fully the usual 
proportion of the world’s goodness, and that the 
blame of his failure, as we have said, lies not 
chiefly with the world. 
Where then does it lie? We are foreed to 
227

  THE BEST OF THE WORLD'S CLASSICS 
  answer, With himself; it is his inward, not his 
outward misfortunes, that bring him to the dust. 
Seldom indeed is it otherwise—seldom is a life 
morally wrecked, but the grand cause lies in 
some internal mal-arrangement, some want less 
of good fortune than of good guidance. Nature 
fashions no creature without implanting in it the 
strength needful for its action and duration: 
least of all does she so neglect her masterpiece 
and darling, the poetie soul. Neither ean we be- 
lieve that it is in the power of any external cir- 
cumstances utterly to ruin the mind of a man— 
nay, if proper wisdom be given him, even so 
much as to affect its essential health and beauty. 
The sternest sum-total of all worldly misfortunes 
is death—nothing more can lie in the cup of 
human woe: yet many men, in all ages, have 
triumphed over death, and led it captive, con- 
verting its physical victory into a moral victory 
for themselves, into a seal and immortal con- 
secration for all that their past life had achieved. 
What has been done may be done again—nay, 
it is but the degree and not the kind of such 
heroism that differs in different seasons; for 
without some portion of this spirit, not of bois- 
terous daring, but of silent fearlessness, of self- 
denial, in all its forms, no good man, in any scene 
or time, has ever attained to be good. 
We have already stated the error of Burns, 
and mourned-over it rather than blamed it. It 
was the want of unity in his purposes, of con- 
sistency in his aims, the hapless attempt to min- 
gle in friendly union the common spirit of the 
world with the spirit of poetry, which is of a 
far different and altogether irreconcilable nature. 
228
-P-A-G-E-236
  THOMAS CARLYLE   
Burns was nothing wholly, and. Burns could be 
nothing—no man formed as he was can be any- 
thing by halves. The heart, not of a mere hot- 
blooded, popular verse monger, or poetical Res- 
taurateur, but of a true poet and singer, worthy 
of the old religious heroic times, had been given 
him: and he fell in an age, not of heroism and 
religion, but of scepticism, selfishness and trivi- 
ality, when true nobleness was little understood, 
and its place supplied by a hollow, dissocial, 
altogether barren and unfruitful principle of 
pride. The influences of that age, his open, kind, 
susceptible nature, to say nothing of his highly 
untoward situation, made it more than usually 
diffieult for him to repel or resist: the better 
spirit that was within him ever sternly demanded 
its rights, its supremacy: he spent his life in 
endeavoring to reconcile these two, and lost it, 
as he must have lost it, without reconciling them 
here. 
Burns was born poor, and born also to con- 
tinue poor, for he would not endeavor to be oth- 
erwise: this it had been well could he have once 
for all admitted and considered as finally settled. 
He was poor, truly; but hundreds even of his 
own elass and order of minds have been poorer, 
yet have suffered nothing deadly from it—nay, 
his own father had a far sorer battle with un- 
grateful destiny than his was; and he did not 
yield to it, but died courageously warring, and 
to all moral intents prevailing against it. True, 
Burns had little means, had even little time for 
poetry, his only real pursuit and vocation; but 
so much the more precious was what little he 
had. Jn all these external respects his case was 
. 229
-P-A-G-E-237
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD'S CLASSICS 
  hard, but very far from the hardest. Poverty, 
incessant drudgery, and much worse evils, it has 
often been the lot of poets and wise men to strive 
with, and their glory to conquer. Locke was ban- 
ished as a traitor, and wrote his ‘‘Essay on the Hu- 
man Understanding,’’ sheltering himself in a Dutch 
garret. Was Milton rich or at his ease when he 
composed ‘‘Paradise Lest’’?? Not only low, but 
fallen from a height; not only poor, but impov- 
erished: in darkness and with dangers ecompassed 
round, he sang his immortal song, and found fit 
audience, though few. Did not Cervantes finish 
his work a maimed soldier, and in prison? Nay, 
was not the ‘‘Araucana,’’ which Spain acknowl- 
edges as its epic, written without even the aid 
of paper; on scraps of leather, as the stout 
fighter and voyager snatched any moment from 
that wild warfare? 
And what then had these men which Burns 
wanted? Two things; both which it seems to us 
are indispensable for such men: they had a true 
religions principle of morals, and a single not a 
double aim in their activity. They were not self- 
seekers and self-worshippers, but seekers and 
worshippers of something far better than self. 
Not personal enjoyment was their object; but a 
high heroic idea of religion, of patriotism, of 
heavenly wisdom, in one or the other form, ever 
hovered before them; in which cause they neither 
shrunk from suffering, nor called on the earth 
to witness it as something wonderful, but pati- 
ently endured, counting it blessedness enough so 
to spend and be spent. Thus the ‘‘golden calf 
of self-love,’’ however curiously carved, was not 
their Deity, but the Invisible Goodness, which 
230

  alone ig man’s reasonable service. This feeling 
was as a celestial fountain, whose streams re- 
freshed into gladness and beauty all the prov- 
inces of their otherwise too desolate existence. 
In a word, they willed one thing, to which all 
other things were subordinated and made sub- 
servient, and therefore they accomplished it. The © 
wedge will rend rocks, but its edge must be sharp 
and single: if it be double the wedge is bruised. 
Doubtless there was a remedy for. this per- 
verseness, but not in others—only in himself; 
least of all in simple increase of wealth and 
worldly ‘‘respectability.’? We hope we have 
now heard enough about the efficacy of wealth 
for poetry and to make poets happy. Nay, have 
we not seen another instance of it in these very 
days? Byron, a man of an endowment consid- 
erably less ethereal than that of Burns, is born 
in the rank not of a Scottish ploughman, but of - 
an English peer: the highest worldly honors, the 
fairest worldly career, are his by inheritance: 
the richest harvest of fame he soon reaps, in an- 
other province, by his own hand. And what does 
all this avail him? Is he happy, is he good, is 
he true? Alas, he has a poet’s soul, and strives 
toward the infinite and the eternal; and soon 
feels that all this is but mounting to the house- 
top to reach the stars! Like Burns, he is only a 
proud man; might, like him, have ‘‘purchased a 
pocket-copy of Milton to study the character of 
Satan’’; for Satan also is Byron’s grand ex- 
emplar, the hero of his poetry. and the model’ 
apparently of his conduct. As in Burns’s case, 
too, the celestial element will uot mingle with the 
elay of earth; bath poet and man of the world he

must not be; vulgar ambition will not live kindly 
with poetic adoration; he cannot serve God and 
Mammon. Byron, like Burns, is not happy; nay, 
he is the most wretched of all men. His life is 
falsely arranged: the fire that is in him is not 
a strong, still, central fire, warming into beauty 
the products of a world, but it is the mad fire 
of a voleano;. and now—we look sadly into the 
ashes of a crater, which, erelong, will fill itself 
with snow!

WE would speak first of the Puritans, the most 
remarkable body of men, perhaps, which the 
world has ever produced. The odious and ridieu- 
lous parts of their eharacter lie on the surface. 
He that runs may read them; nor have there been 
wanting attentive and malicious observers to 
point them out. For many years after the 
Restoration they were the theme of unmeasured. 
invective and derision. They were exposed to 
the utmost licentiousness of the press and of the 
stage, at the time when the press and the stage 
were most licentious. They were not men of 
letters; they were, as a body, ‘unpopular; they 
eould not defend themselves; and the public 
would not take them under its protection. They 
were therefore abandoned, without reserve, to the 
1¥rom the essay on Milton, contributed to the Edinburgh 
Review of August, 1825, when the author was only twenty- 
five years old.

tender mercies of the satirists and dramatists. 
The ostentatious simplicity of their dress, their 
3our aspect, their nasal twang, their stiff posture, 
their long graces, their Hebrew names, their 
seriptural phrases which they introduced on every 
occasion, their contempt of human learning, their 
detestation of polite amusements, were indeed 
fair game for the laughers. But it is not from 
the laughers alone that the philosophy of history 
is to be learned. And he who approaches this 
subject should carefully guard against the in- 
fluence of that potent ridieule which has already 
mislead so many exeellent writers.

Che mortali perigli in se contiene

Those who roused the people to resistance; 
who directed their measures through a long 
series of eventful years; who formed, out of 
the most unpromising materials, the finest army 
that Europe had ever seen; who trampled down 
king, Church, and aristocracy; who in the short 
intervals of domestic sedition and rebellion, made 
the name of England terrible to every nation on 
the face of the earth—were no vulgar fanatics. 
Most of their absurdities were mere external 
badges, like the signs of freemasonry or the 
dresses of friars. We regret that these badges 
were not more attractive. We regret that a 
body to whose courage and talents mankind has 
ywed inestimable obligations had not the lofty 
elegance which distinguished some of the ad- 
herents of Charles the First, or the easy good-

  breeding for which the court of Charles the 
Second was celebrated. But, if we must make 
our choice, we shall, like Bassanio in. the play, 
turn from the specious caskets which contain only 
the Death’s head and the Fool’s head, and fix on 
the plain leaden chest which conceals the treasure. 
The Puritans were men whose minds had’ de- 
rived a peculiar character from the daily con- 
templation of superior beings and eternal in- 
terests. Not .content with acknowledging, in 
general terms, an overruling Providence, they 
habitually ascribed every event to the will of 
the Great Being for whose power nothing was 
too vast, for whose inspection nothing was too 
minute, To know Him, to serve Him, to enjay Him, 
was with them the grvatest end of existence. They 
rejected with contempt the ceremonious homage 
other sects substituted for the pure worship of 
the soul. Instead of catching occasional glimpses 
of the Deity through an obscuring veil, they 
aspired to gaze full on His intolerable brightness, 
and to commune with Him face to face. Hence 
originated their contempt for terrestrial dis- 
tinetions. The difference between the greatest 
and the meanest of mankind seemed to vanish 
when compared with the boundless interval 
which separated the whole race from Him on 
whom their own eyes were constantly fixt. They 
recognized no title to superiority but His favor; 
and, confident of that favor, they despised all the 
accomplishments and all the dignities of the 
world. If they were unacquainted with the 
works of philosophers and poets, they were 
deeply read in the oracles of God. If their 
names were not found in the registers of heralds, 
235

  they were recorded in the Book of Life. If their 
steps were not accompanied by a splendid train 
of menials, legions of ministering angels had 
charge over them. Their palaces were houses 
not made with hands; their diadems crowns of 
glory which should never fade away. On the 
rich and the eloquent, on nobles and priests, 
they looked down with contempt, for they es- 
teemed themselves rich in a more precious 
treasure, and eloquent in a more sublime 
language, nobles by the right of an early 
creation, and priests by the imposition of a 
mightier hand. The very meanest of them was 
a being to whose fate a mysterious and terrible 
importance belonged; on whose slightest action 
the spirits of light and darkness looked with 
anxious interest; who had been destined, before 
heaven and earth were created, to enjoy a felicity 
which should continue when heaven and earth 
should have passed away. Events which short- 
sighted politicians ascribed to earthly causes 
had been ordained on his account. For his sake 
empires. had risen, and flourished, and decayed. 
Thus the Puritan was made up of two 
different men, the one all self-abasement, 
penitence, gratitude, passion, the other proud, 
calm, inflexible, sagacious. He prostrated him- 
self in the dust before his Maker; but he set 
his foot on the neck of his king. In his devo- 
tional retirement, he prayed with convulsions, 
and groans, and tears. He was half-maddened 
by glorious or terrible illusions. He heard the 
lyres. of angels, or the tempting whispers of 
fiends. He eaught a gleam of the Beatifie 
Vision, or awoke, screaming, from dreams of

everlasting fire. Like Vane, be thought himself 
jntrusted with the scepter of the millennial year. 
Like Fleetwood, he cried in the bitterness of his 
soul that God had hidden His face from him. 
But when he took his seat in the council, or girt 
on his sword for war, these tempestuous workings 
of the soul had left no perceptible trace behind 
them. People who saw nothing of the Godly 
but their uncouth visages, and heard nothing 
from them but their groans and their whining 
hymns, might leugh at them. But those had 
little reason to laugh who encountered them in 
the hall of debate or in the field of battle. These 
fanatics brought to civil and military affairs a 
coolness of judgment and immutability of pur- 
pose which some writers have thought incon- 
sistent with their religious zeal, but which were 
in facet the necessary effects of it.| The in- 
tensity of their feelings on one subject made 
them tranquil on every other. One overpowering 
sentiment had subjected to itself pity and hatred, 
ambition and fear. Death had lost its terrors

and their tears, their raptures and their sor- 
rows, but not for the things of this’ world. 
Enthusiasm had made them stoies, had cleared 
their minds from every vulgar passion and 
prejudice, and raised them above the influence 
of danger and of corruption. It sometimes might 
lead them to pursue unwise ends, but never to 
choose unwise theans. They went through the 
world, like Sir Artegal’s iron man Talus with 
his flail, crushing and trampling down op- 
pressors, mingling with human beings, but having 
neither part nor lot in human infirmities, in-

not to be pierced by any weapon, nor to be 
withstood by any barrier. 
Such we believe to have been the character 
of the Puritans. We perceive the absurdity of 
their manners. We dislike the sullen gloom of 
their domestic habits. We acknowledge that the 
tone of their minds was often injured by -strain- 
ing after things too high for mortal reach; and 
we know that, in spite of their hatred of popery, 
they too often fell into the worst vices of that 
bad system, intolerance and extravagant aus- 
terity, that they had their anchorites and their 
crusades, their Dunstans and their De Montforts, 
their Dominies and their Eseobars. Yet, when 
all circumstances ‘are taken into consideration, 
we do not hesitate to pronounce them a brave, 
a wise, an honest. and a useful body.

CROMWELL’S ARMY* 
Tur army which now became supreme in the 
state was an army very different from any that 
has since been seen among us. At present the 
pay of the common soldier is not such as can 
seduce any but the humblest class of English 
laborers from their calling. A barrier almost 
impassable.separates him from the commissioned 
officer. The great majority of those who rise 
high in the service rise by purchase. So numer-

ous and extensive are the remote dependencies 
of England, that every man who enlists in the 
Ine must expect to pass many years in exile, 
and some years in climates unfavorable to the 
health and vigor of the European race. The 
army of the Long Parliament was raised for. 
home service. The pay of the private soldier 
was much above the wages earned by the great — 
body of the people; and, if he distinguished 
himself by intelligence and courage, he might 
hope to attain high commands. The ranks were 
accordingly composed of persons superior in 
station and education to the multitude. These 
persons, sober, moral, diligent, and accustomed 
to reflect, had been induced to take up arms, 
not by the pressure of want, not by the love of 
noveity and license, not by the arts of recruiting 
officers, but by religious and political zeal, 
mingled with the desire of distinction and pro- 
motion. The boast of the soldiers, as we find 
it recorded in their solemn resolutions, was that 
they had not been forced into the service, nor 
had enlisted chiefly for the sake of luere, that 
they were no Janizaries, but free-born English- 
men, who had, of their own accord, put their 
lives in jeopardy for the liberties and religion 
of England, and whose right and duty it was to 
watch over the welfare of the nation which they 
had saved. . 
A force thus composed might, without injury 
to its efficiency, be indulged in some liberties 
which, if allowed to any other troops, would 
have proved subversive of all discipline. Ia

  resoiutions on high questions of state, would soon 
break loose from all control, would cease to form 
an army and would become the worst and most 
dangerous of mobs. Nor would it be safe, in 
our time, to tolerate in any regiment religious 
meetings at which a corporal versed in Scripture 
should lead the devotions of his less gifted 
colonel, - and admonish a backsliding. major. 
But such was the intelligence, the gravity, and 
the self-command of the warriors whom Crom- 
well had trained, that in their eamp a political 
’ organization and a religious organization could 
exist without destroying military organization. 
The same men, who, off duty, were noted as 
demagogs and ‘field-preachers, were distinguished 
by steadiness, by the spirit of order, and by 
prompt obedience on wateh, on drill, and on the 
field of battle. 
In war this strange force was irresistible. The 
stubborn courage characteristic of the English 
people was, by the system of Cromwell, at once 
regulated and stimulated. Other leaders have 
maintained order as strict. Other leaders have 
inspired their followers with zeal as ardent. But 
in his camp alone the most rigid discipline was 
found: in company with the fiercest enthusiasm. 
His troops moved to victory with the precision 
of machines, while burning with the wildest fa- 
naticism of Crusaders. From the time when the 
army was. remodeled to the time when it was 
disbanded,.it never found, either in the British 
islands or on the Continent,.an enemy who could 
stand its onset. In England, Scotland, Ireland, 
Flanders, the Puritan warriors, often surrounded 
by difficulties, sometimes contending against

threefold. odds, not only never failed to conquer, 
but never failed to destroy and break in pieces 
whatever force was opposed to them. Tey at 
length came to regard the day of battle as a day 
of certain triumph, and marched against the 
most renowned battalions of Hurope with dis- 
dainful confidence. Turenne was startled by the 
shout of stern exultation with which his English 
allies advanced to the combat, and exprest the 
delight of a true soldier when he learned that 
it was ever the fashion of Cromwell’s pikemen 
to rejoice greatly when they beheld the enemy; 
and the banished Cavaliers felt an emotion of 
national pride when they saw a brigade of their 
countrymen, outnumbered by foes and abandoned 
by friends, drive before it in headlong rout the 
finest infantry of Spain, and force a passage 
into a counterserap which had just been pro- 
nounced impregnable by the ablest of the mar- 
shals of France. 
But that which chiefly distinguished the army 
of Cromwell from other armies was the austere 
morality and the fear of God which pervaded 
all ranks. It is acknowledged by the most zealous 
Royalists that, in that singular camp, no oath 
was heard, no drunkenness or gambling was seen, 
and that, during the long dominion of the sol- 
diery, the property of the peaceable citizen and 
the honor of woman were held sacred. If out- 
rages were committed, they were outrages of a 
very different kind from those of which a vic- 
torious army is generally guilty. No servant-girl 
complained of the rough gallantry of the redcoats. 
Not an ounce of plate was taken from the shops 
of the goldsmiths. But a Pelagian sermon, or

a window on which the Virgin and the Child 
were painted, produced in the Puritan ranks an 
excitement which it required the utmost exer- 
tions of the officers to-quell. One of Cromwell’s 
chief difficulties was to restrain his musketeers 
and dragoons from invading by main force the 
pulpits of ministers whose discourses, to use the 
language of that time, were not savory; and 
too many of our cathedrals still bear the marks 
of the hatred with which those stern spirits re- 
garded every vestige of Popery.

THE OPENING OF THE TRIAL OF 
WARREN HASTINGS* 
In the mean time, the preparations for the 
trial had proceeded rapidly; and on the thir- 
ceenth of February, 1788, the sittings of the 
Court commeneed. There have been spectacles 
more dazzling to the eye, more gorgeous with 
jewelry and cloth of gold, more attractive to 
grown-up children, than that which was then 
exhibited at Westminster; but perhaps there 
never was a spectacle so well calculated to strike 
a highly cultivated, a reflecting, an imaginative 
mind. All the various kinds of interest which 
belong to the near and to the distant, to the 
present. and to the past, were collected en one

spot and in one hour.- All the talents and all 
the accomplishments which are developed by lib- 
erty and civilization were now displayed, with 
every advantage that could be derived both from 
cooperation and from contrast.. Every step in 
the proceedings carried the mind either back- 
ward, through many troubled centuries, to the 
days when the foundations of our constitution 
were laid; or far away, over boundless seas and 
deserts, to dusky nations living under strange 
stars, worshiping strange gods, and writing 
strange characters from right to left. The High 
Court of Parliament was to sit, according to 
forms handed down from the days of the Plan- 
tagenets, on an Englishman accused of exercising 
tyranny over the lord of the holy city of Benares, 
and over the ladies of the princely house of Oude. 
The place was worthy of such a trial. It was 
the great hall of William Rufus, the hall which 
had resounded with acclamations at the inau- 
guration of thirty kings, the hall which had wit- 
nessed the just sentence of Bacon and the just 
absolution of Somers, the hall where the elo-- 
quence of Strafford had for a moment awea 
and melted a victorious party inflamed with just 
resentment, the hall where Charles had con- 
fronted the High Court of Justice with the placid 
courage which has half redeemed his fame. Nei- 
ther military nor civil pomp was wanting. The 
avenues were lined with grenadiers. The streets 
were kept clear by cavalry. The peers, robed in 
gold and ermine, were marshaled by the heralds 
under Garter King-at-arms. The judges im their.

points of law. Near a hundred and seventy

Upper House then was, walked in solemn order 
from their usual place of assembling to the tri- 
bunal. The junior baron present led the way— 
George Elliot, Lord Heathfield, recently ennobled 
for his memorable defense of Gibraltar against 
the fleets and armies of France and Spain. The 
long procession was closed by the Duke of Nor- 
folk, Earl Marshal of the realm, by the great 
dignitaries, and by the brothers and sons of the 
King. Last of all came the Prince of Wales, 
conspicuous by his fine person and noble bearing. 
The gray old walls were hung with scarlet. The 
long galleries were crowded by an audience such 
as has rarely excited the fears or the emulations 
of an orator. There were gathered together, 
from all parts of a great, free, enlightened, and 
prosperous empire, grace and female loveliness, 
wit and learning, the representatives of every 
science and of every art.. There were seated 
round the Queen the fair-haired young daughters 
of the House of Brunswick. There the ambas- 
sadors of great kings and commonwealths gazed 
with admiration on a spectacle which no other 
country in the world could present. There Sid-

with emotion on a scene surpassing all the im-

The spectacle had allured Reynolds from that 
easel which has preserved to us the thoughtful 
foreheads of so many writers and statesmen, and 
the sweet smiles of so many noble matrons. It 
had induced Parr to suspend his labors in that 
dark and profound mine from which he had 
extracted a vast treasure of erudition; a treasure 
too often buried in the earth, too often paraded 
with injudicious and inelegant ostentation, but 
still precious, massive, and splendid. There ap- 
peared the voluptuous charms of her to whom 
the heir of the throne had in secret plighted his 
faith. There too was she, the beautiful mother 
of a beautiful race, the St. Cecilia whose delicate 
features, lighted up by love and music, art has 
rescued from the common decay. There were 
the members of that brilliant soeiety which 
quoted, criticized, and exchanged repartees under 
the rich peacock hangings of Mrs. Montague. 
And there the ladies whose lips, more persuasive 
than those of Fox himself, had earried the West- 
minster election against palace and treasury, 
shone around Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire. 
The sergeants made proclamation. Hastings 
advanced to the bar and bent his knee. The 
culprit was indeed not unworthy of that great 
presence. He had ruled an oxtensive and pop- 
ulous country, had made laws and treaties, had 
sent forth armies, had set up and pulled down 
princes. And in his high place he had so borne 
himself that all had feared him, that most had 
loved him, and that hatred itself could deny him 
no title to glory except virtue. He looked like 
a great man, and not like a bad man. A person 
small and emaciated, yet deriving dignity from a

the court, indicated also habitual self-possession 
and self-respect, a high and intellectual forehead, 
a brow pensive but not gloomy, a mouth of in 
aaexible decision, a face pale and worn but serene, 
on which was written, as legibly as under the 
picture in the council-ehamber at Caleutta, Mens 
@qua in arduis: such was the aspect with which 
the great proconsul presented himself to his 
judges. 
His counsel aecompanied him—men all of 
whom were afterward raised by their talents 
and learning to the highest posts in their pro- 
fession: the bold and strong-minded Law, after- 
ward Chief Justice of the King’s Bench; the 
more humane and eloquent Dallas, afterward 
Chief Justice of the Common Pleas; and Plomer, 
who, near twenty years later, successfully con- 
ducted in the same high court the defense of 
Lord Melville, and subsequently became Vice- 
Chancellor and Master of the Rolls. 
But neither the culprit nor his advoeates at- 
tracted so much notice as the accusers. In the 
midst of the blaze of red drapery, a space had 
been fitted up with green benches and tables for 
the Commons. The managers, with Burke at 
their head, appeared in full dress. The collectors 
of gossip did not fail to remark that even Fox, 
generally so regardiess of his appearance, had 
paid to the illustrious tribunal the compliment 
of. wearing a bag and sword. Pitt had refused 
to be one of the conductors of the impeachment;

in spite of the absence of these two distinguished. 
members of the Lower House, the box in which 
the managers stood contained an array of speak- 
ers such as perhaps had not appeared together 
since the great age of Athenian eloquence. There 
were Fox and Sheridan, the English Demosthenes

developed by every manly exercise, his face 
beaming with intelligence and spirit—the inge-

most of those who distinguish themselves in life 
are still contending for prizes and fellowships

THE GIFT OF ATHENS TO MAN‘ 
If we consider merely the subtlety of disquisi- 
tion, the force of imagination, the perfect energy 
and elegance of expression, which characterize 
the great works of Athenian genius, we must 
pronounce them intrinsically most valuable; but 
what shall we say when we reflect that from 
these had sprung, directly or indirectly, all the 
noblest ereations of the human intellect; that 
from hence were the vast accomplishments and 
the brilliant faney of Cicero, the withering fire of 
Juvenal; the plastic imagination of Dante; the 
humor of Cervantes; the comprehension of Ba- 
con, the wit of Butler; the supreme and universal 
excellence of Shakespeare? All the triumphs of 
truth and genius over prejudice and power, in 
every country and in every age, have been the 
triumphs of Athens. Wherever a few great

fraud, in the cause of liberty and reason, there 
has been her spirit in the midst of them; in- 
spiring, encouraging, consoling—by the lonely 
lamp of Erasmus; by the restless bed of Pascal; 
in the tribune of Mirabeau; in the cell of Galileo; 
on the seaffold of Sidney. But who shall estimate 
her influence on private happiness? Who shall 
say how many thousands have been made wiser, 
happier, and better by those pursuits in which 
she has taught mankind to engage; to how many 
the studies which took their rise from her have 
been wealth in poverty—liberty in bondage— 
health in sickness—society in solitude. Her 
power is indeed manifested at the bar; in the 
senate; in the field of battle; in the schools of 
philosophy. But these are not her glory. Wher- 
ever literature consoles sorrow, or assuages pain 
—wherever it brings gladness to eyes which fail 
with wakefulness and tears, and ache for the 
dark house and the long sleep—there is exhibited, 
in its noblest form, the immortal influence of 
Athens. 
The dervish in the Arabian tale did not hes- 
itate to abandon to his comrade the camels with 
their load of jewels and gold, while he retained 
the casket of that juice which enabled him to 
behold at a glance all the hidden riches of the 
universe. Surely it is no exaggeration to say 
that no external advantage is to be compared 
with that purification of the intellectual eye 
which gives us to contemplate the infinite wealth 
of the mental world; all the hoarded treasures of 
the primeval dynasties, all the shapeless ore 
of its yet unexplored mines. This is the gift of 
Athens to man. Her freedom and her power

nihilated; her people have degenerated into timid 
slaves; her language into a barbarous jargon; 
her temples have been given up to the successive 
depredations of Romans, Turks, and Seotehmen;* 
but her intellectual empire is imperishable. And, 
when those who have rivaled her greatness shall 
have shared her fate: when civilization and 
knowledge shall have fixt their abode in distant 
continents; when the scepter shall have passed 
away from England; when perhaps, travelers 
from distant regions shall in vain labor to de- 
cipher on some moldering pedestal the name of 
our proudest chief; shall hear savage hymns 
chanted to some misshaped idol over the ruined 
dome of our proudest temple: and shall see a 
single naked fisherman wash his nets in the river 
of the ten thousand masts—her influence and her 
glory will still survivé—fresh in eternal youth, 
exempt from mutability.and decay, immortal as 
the intellectual principle from which they de- 
rived their origin, and over which they exercise 
their control. .

THE PATHOS OF BYRON’S LIFE* 
Tux pretty fable by which the Duchess of 
Orleans illustrates the character of her son, the 
regent, might, with little change, be applied to 
Byron. All the fairies, save one, had been bidden 
to his cradle. All the gossips had been profuse 
of their gifts. One had bestowed nobility, an- 
other genius, a third beauty. The malignant elf 
who had been uninvited came last, and, unable 
to reverse what her sisters had done for their 
favorite, had mixt up a curse with every blessing. 
He was sprung of a house, ancient indeed and 
noble, but degraded and impoverished by a series 
of erimes and follies, which had attained a sean- 
dalous publicity. The kinsman whom he sue- 
ceeded had died poor, and, but for merciful 
judges, would have died upon the gallows. The 
young peer had great intellectual powers; yet 
there was an unsound part in his mind. He had 
naturally a generous and tender heart; but his 
temper was irritable and wayward. He had a 
head which statuaries loved to copy, and a foot 
the deformity of which the beggars in the street 
mimicked. Distinguished at once by the strength 
and by the weakness of his intellect, affectionate 
yet perverse, a poor lord, and a handsome erip- 
ple, he required, if ever man required, the firmest

  and the most judicious training. But, eapricious- 
ly as nature had dealt with him, the relative 
to whom the office of forming his character was 
entrusted was more capricious still. She passed 
from paroxysms of rage to paroxysms of fond- 
ness. At one time’ she stifled him with her 
earesses, at another time she insulted his de- 
formity. oo 
He came into the world, and the world treated 
him as his mother treated him—sometimes with 
kindness, sometimes with severity, never with 
justice. It indulged him without discrimination, 
and punished him without discrimination. He 
was truly a spoilt child; not merely the spoilt 
child of his parents, but the spoilt child of na- 
tare, the spoilt child of fortune, the spoilt child 
of fame, the spoilt child of society. His first 
poems” were received with a contempt which, 
feeble as they were, they did not absolutely de- 
serve. The poem which he published on his 
returns from his travels* was, on the other hand, 
extolled far above its merits. At twenty-four 
he found himself on the highest pinnacle of lit- 
erary fame, with Scott, Wordsworth, Southey, 
and a crowd of other distinguished writers, be- 
neath his feet. There is scarcely an instance 
in history of so sudden a rise to so dizzy an 
eminence.

sibilities of our nature—the gaze of a hundred 
drawing-rooms, the aeclamations of the whole 
nation, the applause of applauded men, the love 
of the loveliest women—all this world, and the 
glory of it, were at once offered to a young man, 
to whom nature had given violent passions, and 
whom education had never taught to control 
them. He lived as many men live who have no 
similar exeuses to plead for his faults. But his 
countrymen and his countrywomen would love him 
and admire him. They were resolved to see in 
his excesses only the flash and outbreak of the 
same fiery mind which glowed in his poetry. He 
attacked religion; yet in religious circles his 
name was mentioned with fondness, and in many 
religious publications his works were censured 
with singular tenderness. He lampooned the 
Prince Regent; yet he could not alienate the 
Tories. Everything, it seems, was to be forgiven 
to youth, rank, and genius. 
Then came the reaction. Society, capricious 
in its indignation as it had been capricious in 
its fondness, flew into a rage with its froward 
and petted darling. He had been worshiped with 
an irrational idolatry. He was persecuted with 
an irrational fury. Much has been written about 
those unhappy domestie oceurrences which de- 
cided the fate of his fe. Yet mothing ever was 
positively known to the public but this—that he 
quarreled with his lady, and that she refused 
to live with him. There haye been hints in 
abundance, and shrugs and shakings of the head,

was more to blame than any other man who is

with eveat pride the high standard of morals 
estabished in England, with the Parisian laxity. 
At length our anger is satiated. Our victim is 
ruined and heart-broken. And our virtue goes 
quietly to sleep for seven years more. 
Tt is clear that those vices which destroy do- 
mestie happiness ought to be as much as possible 
represt. It is equally clear that they ean not’ 
be represt by penal legislation. It is therefore 
right and desirable that publie opinion should 
be directed against them. But. it should be di- 
rected against them uniformly, steadily, and tem- 
perately, not by. sudden fits and starts. There 
should be one weight and one measure. Declama- 
tion is always an objectionable mode of punish- 
ment. It is the resource of judges too indolent 
and hasty to investigate facts, and to discrim- 
inate nicely between shades of guilt. It is an 
irrational practise, even when adopted by mil- 
itary tribunals. When adopted by the tribunal 
of public opinion, it is infinitely more irrational. 
It is good that a certain portion of disgrace 
should constantly attend on certain bad actions. 
But it is not good that the offenders merely have 
to stand the risks of a lottery of infamy that 
ninety-nine out of every hundred should escape;

nocent of the hundred, should pay for all. . . . 
We can not even now retrace those events 
without feeling something of what was felt by 
the nation when it. was first known that the grave 
had closed over so much sorrow and so much 
glory—something of what was felt by those who 
saw the hearse, with its long train of coaches, 
turn slowly northward, leaving behind it that 
cemetery, which had been consecrated by the 
dust of so many great poets, but of which the 
doors were closed against all that remained of 
Byron. We well remember that, on that day, 
rigid moralists could not refrain from weeping 
for one so young, so illustrious, so unhappy, 
gifted with such rare gifts and tried by such 
strong temptations. It is unnecessary to make 
~any reflections. The history carries its. moral 
with it. Our age has indeed been fruitful of 
warnings to the eminent, and of consolation to 
the obscure. Two men have died within our 
recollection, who at a time of life at which few 
people have completed their education, had raised 
themselves, each in his own department, to the 
height of glory. One of them died at Longwood,’ 
the other at Missolonghi.” 
°The seaport village on the island of St. Helena in which 
Napoleon died. 
4 Missolonghi, where Byron died, lies on the Gulf of Pat- 
Yas, on the western coast of northern Greece.

PREFACE TO THE REVISED EDITION 
Autnors, no doubt, are always gratified when their 
works find favorable acceptance. The writer of this text 
has been doubly gratified, however, at the cordial recep- 
tion and widespread use accorded to the present volume. 
This feeling does not arise from any narrow personal 
pride or selfish interest, but rather from the fact that 
the warm approval of the educational public has proved 
an important point; namely, that the fundamental 
truths of psychology, when put simply and concretely, 
can be made of interest and value to students of all ages 
from high school juniors up, and to the general public 
as well. More encouraging still, it has been demon- 
strated that the teachings of psychology can become im- 
mediately helpful, not only in study or teaching, but 
also in business or profession, in the control and guid- 
ance of the personal life, and in the problems met in the 
routine of the day’s work or its play. 
In effecting the present revision, the salient features 
of the original edition have been kept. The truths pre- 
sented are the most fundamental and important in the 
field of psychology. Disputed theories and unsettled 
opinions are excluded. The subject matter is made con- 
erete and practical by the use of many illustrations and 
through application to real problems. The style has 
been kept easy and familiar to facilitate the reading. 
In short, there has been, while seeking to improve the 
volume, a conscious purpose to omit none of the char-

acteristics which secured acceptance for the former edi- 
tion. 
On the other hand, certain changes and additions have 
been made which, it is believed, will add to the strength 
of the work. First of all, the later psychological studies 
and investigations have been drawn upon to insure that 
the matter shall at all points be abreast of the times in 
scientific accuracy. Because of the wide use of the text 
in the training of teachers, a more specific educational 
application to schoolroom problems has been made in 
various chapters. Exercises for the guidance of observa- 
tion work and personal introspection are freely used. 
The chapter on Sensation and Perception has been sep- 
arated into two chapters, and each subject given more 
extensive treatment. A new chapter has been added on 
Association. The various chapters have been subdivided 
into numbered sections, and cut-in paragraph tepics 
have been used to facilitate the study and teaching of 
the text. Minor changes and additions occur through- 
out the volume, thus adding some forty pages to the 
number in the original edition. 
Many of the modifications made in the revision are due 
to valuable suggestions and kindly criticisms received 
from many teachers of the text in various types of 
schools. To all who have thus helped so generously by 
freely giving the author the fruits of their judgment 
and experience he gladly renders grateful thanks.

  THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
CHAPTER I 
THE MIND, OR CONSCIOUSNESS 
‘ "Wz are to study the mind and its education; but how? 
It is easy to understand how we may investigate the 
great world of material things about us; for we can see it, 
touch it, weigh it, or measure it. But how are we to 
discover the nature of the mind, or come to know the 
processes by which consciousness works? For mind is 
intangible ;\we cannot see it, feel it, taste it, or handle it. 
Mind belongs not to the realm of matter which is known 
to the senses, but to the realm of spirit, which the senses 
can never grasp. And yet the mind can be known and 
studied as truly and as scientifically as can the world 
of matter. Let us first of all see how this can be done. 
1. HOW MIND IS TO BE KNOWN 
The Personal Character of Consciousness.—Mind can be 
observed and known. But each one can know directly 
only his own mind, and not another’s. You and I may 
look into each other’s face- and there guess the. mean- 
ing that lies back of the smile or frown or flash of the 
1
-P-A-G-E-20
    
eee THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
-eye, and so read something of the mind’s activity. But 
neither directly meets the other’s mind. I may learn 
-to recognize your features, know your voice, respond to 
the clasp of your hand; but the mind, the consciousness, 
which does your thinking and feels your joys and sor- 
rows, I can never know completely. Indeed I can never 
~ know your mind at all except through your bodily acts 
and expressions. Nor is there any way in which you 
can reveal your mind, your spiritual self, to me except 
through these means. 
It follows therefore that only you can ever know you 
and only J can ever know I in any first-hand and im- 
mediate way. Between your consciousness and mine 
there exists a wide gap that cannot be bridged. Each 
of us lives apart. We are like ships that pass and hail 
each other in passing but do not touch. We may work 
together, live together, come to love or hate each other, 
and yet our inmost selves forever. stand alone. They 
must live their own lives, think their own thoughts, and 
arrive at their own destiny. 
Introspection the Only Means of Discovering Nature of 
Consciousness.— What, then, is mind? What is the thing 
that we call consciousness? No mere definition can ever 
wake it clearer than it is at this moment to each of us. 
The only. way to know what mind is, is to look in upon 
our own consciousness and observe what is transpiring 
there. In the language of the psychologist, we must 
introspect. For one can never come to understand the 
nature of mind and its laws of working by listening to 
lectures or reading text books alone. There is no psy- 
chology in the text, but only in your living, flowing 
stream of thought and mine. True, the lecture and the 
book may tell us what to look for when we introspect, 
and how to understand what we find. But the state- 
 
-P-A-G-E-21
  THE MIND, OR CONSCIOUSNESS 3 
ments and descriptions about our minds must be verified 
by our own observation and experience before they be- 
come vital truth to us. 
How We Introspect.—Introspection is something of an. 
art; it has to be learned. Some master it easily, some 
with more difficulty, and some, it is to be feared, never 
become skilled in its use. In order to introspect one 
must catch himself unawares, so to speak, in the very act 
of thinking, remembering, deciding, loving, hating, and 
all the rest. These fleeting phases of consciousness are 
ever on the wing; they never pause in their restless 
flight and we must catch them as they go. This is not 
so easy as it appears; for the moment we turn to look 
in upon the mind, that moment consciousness changes. 
The thing we meant to examine is gone, and something 
else has taken its place. All that is left us then is to 
view the mental object while it is still fresh in the mem- 
ory, or to catch it again when it returns. 
Studying Mental States of Others through Expression.— 
Although I can meet only my own mind face to face, I 
am, nevertheless, under the necessity of judging your 
mental states and knowing what is taking place in 
your consciousness. For in order to work successfully 
with you, in order to teach you, understand you, con- 
trol you or obey you, be your friend or enemy, or as- 
sociate with you in any other way, I must know you. 
But the real you that I must know is hidden behind the 
physical mask that we call the body. I must, therefore, 
be able to understand your states of consciousness as 
they are reflected in your bodily expressions. Your 
face, form, gesture, speech, the tone of voice, laughter 
and tears, the poise of attention, the droop of grief, 
the tenseness of anger and start of fear,—all these tell 
the story of the mental state that lies behind the senses.
-P-A-G-E-22
  4 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
These various expressions are the pictures on the screen 
by which your mind reveals itself to others; they are 
the language by which the inner self speaks to the world 
without. 
Learning to Interpret Expression—If I would under- 
stand the workings of your mind I must therefore learn 
to read the language of physical expression. I must 
study human nature and learn to observe others. I 
must apply the information found in the texts to an 
interpretation of those about me. This study of others 
may be uncritical, as in the mere intelligent observation 
of those I meet; or it may be scientific, as when I con- 
duct carefully planned psychological experiments. But 
in either case it consists in judging the inner states of © 
consciousness by their physical manifestations. 
The three methods by which mind may be studied 
are, then: (1). textbook description and explanation; 
(2) introspection of my own conscious processes; -and 
(3) observation of others, either uncritical or scientific. 
2. THE NATURE OF CONSCIOUSNESS 
Inner Nature of the Mind Not Revealed by Introspec- 
tion.—We are not to be too greatly discouraged if, even 
by introspection, we cannot discover exactly what the 
mind is. No one knows what electricity is, though 
nearly everyone uses it in one form or another. We 
study the dynamo, the motor, and the conductors through 
which electricity manifests itself. We observe its effects 
in light, heat, and mechanical power, and so learn the 
laws which govern its operations. But we are almost 
as far from understanding its true nature as were the 
ancients who knew nothing of its uses. The dynamo 
does not create the electricity, but only furnishes the
-P-A-G-E-23
  THE MIND, OR CONSCIOUSNESS 5 
conditions which make it possible for electricity to mani- 
fest itself in doing the world’s work. Likewise the 
brain or nervous system does not create the mind, but 
it furnishes the machine through which the mind works. 
‘We may study the nervous system and learn something 
of the conditions and limitations under which the mind 
operates, but this is not studying the mind itself. As 
in the case of electricity, what we know about the mind 
we must learn through the activities in which it mani- 
fests itself—these we can know, for they are in the 
experience of all. It is, then, only by studying these 
processes of consciousness that we come to know the laws 
which govern the mind and its development. What 
it is that thinks and feels and wills in us. is too hardy 
a problem for us here—indeed, has been too hard a 
problem for the philosophers through the ages. But 
the thinking and feeling and willing we can watch as 
they occur, and hence come to know. 
Consciousness as a Process or Stream.—In looking in 
upon the mind we must expect to discover, then, not a 
thing, but a process. The thing forever eludes us, but 
the process is always present. Consciousness is like a 
stream, which, -so far as we are concerned with it in a 
psychological discussion, has its rise at the cradle and 
its end at the grave. It begins with the babe’s first: 
faint gropings after light in his new world as he enters 
it, and ends with the man’s last blind gropings after 
light in his old world as he leaves it. The stream is 
very narrow at first, only as wide as the few sensations 
which come to the babe when it sees the light or hears 
the sound; it grows wider as the mind develops, and 
is at last measured by the grand sum total of life’s ex- 
perience. 
This mental stream is irresistible. No power outside
-P-A-G-E-24
    6 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
of us can stop it while life lasts. We cannot stop it 
ourselves. When we try to stop thinking, the stream 
but changes its direction and flows on. While we wake 
and while we sleep, while we are unconscious under an 
anesthetic, even, some sort of mental process continues. 
Sometimes the stream flows slowly, and our thoughts 
lag—we ‘‘feel slow’’; again the stream flows faster, 
and we are lively and our thoughts come with a rush; 
or a fever seizes us and delirium comes on; then the 
stream runs wildly onward, defying our control, and a 
mad jargon of thoughts takes the place of our usuai 
orderly array. In different persons, also, the mental 
stream moves at different rates, some minds being nat- 
urally slow-moving and some naturally quick in their 
operations. 
Consciousness resembles a stream also in other par- 
ticulars. A stream is an unbroken whole from its source 
to its mouth, and an observer stationed at one point 
cannot see all of it at once. He sees but the one little 
section which happens to be passing his station point at 
the time. The current may look much the same from 
moment to moment, but the component particles which 
constitute the stream are constantly changing. So it 
is with our thought. Its stream is continuous from 
birth till death, but we cannot see any considerable 
portion of it at one time. When we turn about quickly 
and look in upon our minds, we see but the little present 
moment. That of a few seconds ago is gone and will 
never return. The thought which occupied us a mo- 
ment since can no more be recalled, just as it was, than 
can the particles composing a stream be re-collected and 
made to pass a given point in its course in precisely 
the same order and relation to one another as before. 
This means, then, that we can never have precisely the
-P-A-G-E-25
  THE MIND, OR CONSCIOUSNESS te 
same mental state twice; that the thought of the mo- 
ment cannot have the same associates that it had the 
first time; that the thought of this moment will never 
be ours again; that all we can know of our minds at 
any one time is the part of the process present in con- 
sciousness at that moment. 
The Wave in the Stream of Consciousness—The sur- 
face of our mental stream is not level, but is broken 
  Fie. 1 
by a wave which stands above the rest; which is but 
another way of saying that some one thing is always 
more prominent in our thought than the rest. Only 
when we are in a sleepy reverie, or not thinking about 
much of anything, does the stream approximate a level. 
At all other times some one object occupies the highest 
point in our thought, to the more or less complete ex- 
  clusion of other things which we might think about. A 
thousand and one objects are possible to our thought 
at any moment, but all except one thing occupy a sec- 
ondary place, or are not present to our consciousness at 
all. They exist on the margin, or else are clear off the
-P-A-G-E-26
  8 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
edge of consciousness, while the one thing occupies the 
center. We may be reading a fascinating book late at 
night in a cold room. The charm of the writer, the 
beauty of the heroine, or the bravery of the hero so oc- 
eupies the mind that the weary eyes and chattering teeth 
are unnoticed. Consciousness has piled up in a high 
wave on the points of interest in the book, and the 
bodily sensations are for the moment on a much lower 
level. But let the book grow dull for a moment, and 
  the make-up of the stream changes in a flash. Here, 
heroine, or literary style no longer occupies the wave. 
They forfeit their place, the wave is taken by the bodily 
sensations, and we are conscious of the smarting eyes 
and shivering body, while these in turn give way to 
the next object which occupies the wave. Figs. 1-3 
illustrate these changes. 
Consciousness Likened to a Field.—The consciousness 
of any moment has been less happily likened to a field, 
in the center of which there is an elevation higher than 
the surrounding level. This center is where conscious- 
. ness is piled up on the object which is for the moment 
foremost in our thought. The other objects of our con- 
sciousness are on the margin of the field for the time 
being, but any of them may the next moment claim the 
center and drive the former object to the margin, or it 
may drop entirely out of consciousness. This moment 
 
-P-A-G-E-27
    THE MIND, OR CONSCIOUSNESS 9) 
a noble resolve may occupy the center of the field, while 
a troublesome tooth begets sensationsof discomfort 
which linger. dimly on the outskirts of our conscious- 
ness; but a shooting pain from the tooth or a random 
thought crossing the mind, and lo! the tooth holds 
sway, and the resolve dimly fades to the margin of 
our consciousness and is gone. 
The “Piling Up” of Consciousness is Attention.—This 
figure is not so true as the one which likens our mind 
to a stream with its ever onward current answering to 
the flow of our thought; but whichever figure we em- 
ploy, the truth remains the same. Our mental energy 
is always piled up higher at one point than at others. 
Either because our interest leads us, or because the will 
dictates, the mind is withdrawn from the thousand and 
one things we might think about, and directed to this 
one thing, which for the time occupies chief place. In 
other words, we attend; for this piling up of conscious- 
ness is nothing, after all, but attention. 
3. CONTENT OF THE MENTAL STREAM 
We have seen that our mental life may be likened to 
a stream flowing now faster, now slower, ever shifting, 
never ceasing. We have yet to inquire what constitutes 
the material of the stream, or what is the stuff that 
makes up the current of our thought—what is the 
content of consciousness? The question cannot be fully 
answered at this point, but a general notion can be 
gained which will be of service. 
Why We Need Minds.—Let us first of all ask what 
mind is for, why do animals, including men, have minds? 
The biologist would say, in order that they may adapt 
themselves to their environment. Each individual from
-P-A-G-E-28
10 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
molluse to man needs the amount and type of mind 
that serves to fit its possessor into its particular world 
of activity. Too little mind leaves the animal helpless 
in the struggle for existence. On the other hand a 
mind far above its possessor’s station would prove use- 
less if not a handicap; a molluse could not use the mind 
of a man. 
Content of Consciousness Determined by Function.— 
How much mind does man need? What range and type 
of consciousness will best serve to adjust us to our 
world of opportunity and responsibility? First of all 
we must know our world, hence, our mind must be 
capable of gathering knowledge. Second, we must be 
able to feel its values and respond to the great motives 
for action arising from the emotions. Third, we must 
have the power to exert self-compulsion, which is to 
say that we possess a will to control our acts. These 
three sets of processes, knowing, feeling, and willing, 
we shall, therefore, expect to find making up the content 
of our mental stream. 
Let us proceed at once to test our conclusion by intro- 
spection. If we are sitting at our study table puzzling 
over a difficult problem in geometry, reasoning forms 
the wave in the stream of consciousness—the center of 
the field. It is the chief thing in our thinking. The 
fringe of our consciousness is made up of various sensa- 
tions of the light from the lamp, the contact of our 
clothing, the sounds going on in the next room, some 
bit of memory seeking recognition, a ‘‘tramp’’. thought 
which comes along, and a dozen other experiences not 
strong enough to occupy the center of the field. 
But instead of the study table and the problem, give 
us a bright fireside, an easy-chair, and nothing to do. 
If we are aged, memories—images from out the past—   
 
-P-A-G-E-29
  
  THE MIND, OR CONSCIOUSNESS i 
will probably come thronging in and occupy the field to 
such extent that the fire burns low and the room grows 
cold, but still the forms from the past hold sway. If 
we are young, visions of the future may crowd every- 
thing else to the margin of the field, while the ‘‘castles 
in Spain’’ oceupy the center. 
Our memories may also be accompanied by emotions— 
sorrow, love, anger, hate, envy, joy. And, indeed, these 
emotions may so completely occupy the field that the 
images themselves are for the time driven to the mar- 
gin, and the mind is occupied with its sorrow, its love, 
or its joy. 
Once more, instead of the problem or the memories 
or the ‘‘castles in Spain,’’ give us the necessity of mak- 
ing some decision, great or small, where contending 
motives are pulling us now in this direetion, now in 
that, so that the question finally has to be settled by a 
supreme effort summed up in the words, I will. This 
is the struggle of the will which each one knows for 
himself; for who has not had a raging battle of motives 
occupy the center of the field while all else, even the 
sense of time, place and existence, gave way in the 
face of this conflict! This struggle continues until the 
_ decision is made, when suddenly all the stress and strain 
drop out and other objects may again have place in 
consciousness. 
The Three Fundamental Phases of Consciousness——Thus 
“we see that if we could cut the stream of consciousness 
across as we might cut a stream of water from bank 
to bank with a huge knife, and then look at the cut-off 
section, we should find very different constituents in 
the stream at different times.; We should at one time 
find the mind manifesting itself’ in perceiving, remem- 
bering, imagining, discriminating, comparing, judging,  
-P-A-G-E-30
  12 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
reasoning, or the acts by which we gain our knowledge; 
at another in fearing, loving, hating, sorrowing, enjoy- 
ing, or the acts of feeling; at still another in choosing, 
or the act of the will. These processes would make 
up the stream, or, in other words, these are the acts 
which the mind performs in doing its work. We should 
never find a time when the stream consists of but one of 
the processes, or when all these modes of mental ac- 
tivity are not represented. They will be found in vary- 
ing proportions, now more of knowing, now of feeling, 
and now of willing, but some of each is always present 
in our consciousness. The nature of these different 
elements in our mental stream, their relation to each 
other, and the manner in which they all work together 
in amazing perplexity yet in perfect harmony to produce 
the wonderful mind, will constitute the subject-matter 
we shall consider together in the pages which follow. 
4, WHERE CONSCIOUSNESS RESIDES 
I—the conscious self—dwell somewhere in this body, 
but where? When my finger tips touch the object I 
wish to examine, I seem to be in them. When the brain 
grows weary from overstudy, I seem to be in it. When 
the heart throbs, the breath comes quick, and the 
muscles grow tense from noble resolve or strong emo- 
tion, I seern to be in them all. When, filled with the 
buoyant life of vigorous youth, every fiber and nerve 
is a-tingle with health and enthusiasm, I live in every 
part of my marvelous body. Small wonder that the 
ancients located the soul at one time in the heart, at 
another in the pineal gland of the brain, and at another 
made it coextensive with the body! 
Consciousness Works through the Nervous System.—
-P-A-G-E-31
  THE MIND, OR CONSCIOUSNESS 13 
Later science has taught that the mind resides in and 
works through the nervous system, which has its cen- 
tral office in the brain. And the reason why I seem to 
be in every part of my body is because the nervous: 
~ system extends to every part, carrying messages of sight 
or sound or touch to the brain, and bearing in return 
orders for movements, which set the feet a-dancing or 
the fingers a-tingling. But more of this later. ‘ 
This partnership between mind and body is very close. 
Just how it happens that spirit may inhabit matter 
we may not know. But certain it is that they interact 
on each other. What will hinder the growth of one will 
handicap the other, and what favors the development 
of either will help both. The methods of their co- 
operation and the laws that govern their relationship 
will develop as our study goes on. 
5. PROBLEMS IN OBSERVATION AND INTROSPECTION 
One should always keep in mind that psychology is essen- 
tially a laboratory science, and not a text-book subject. The 
laboratory material is to be found in ourselves and in those 
about us. While the text should be thoroughly mastered, its 
statements should always be verified by reference to one’s 
own experience, and observation of others. Especially should 
prospective teachers constantly correlate the lessons of the 
book with the observation of children at work im the school. 
The problems suggested for observation and introspection will, 
if mastered, do much to render practical and helpful the truths 
of psychology. 
1, Think of your home as you last left it. Can you see 
vividly just how it looked, the color of the paint on the out- 
side, with the familiar form of the roof and all; can you 
recall the perfume in some old drawer, the taste of a favorite 
dish, the sound of a familiar voice in farewell?
-P-A-G-E-32
  14 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
2, What illustrations have you observed where the mental 
content of the moment seemed chiefly thinking (knowledge 
process) ; chiefly emotion (feeling process); chiefly choosing, 
or self-compulsion (willing process) ? 
3. When you say that you remember a circumstance that 
occurred yesterday, how do you remember it? That is, do 
you see in your mind things just as they were, and hear again 
sounds which occurred, or feel again movements which you 
performed? Do you experience once more the emotions you 
then felt? 
4, What forms of expression most commonly reveal thought ; 
what reveal emotions? (I. e, can you tell what a child is 
thinking about by the expression on his face? Can you tell 
tell whether he is angry, frightened, sorry, by his face? Is 
speech as necessary in expressing feeling as in expressing 
thought?) 
5. Try occasionally during the next twenty-four hours to 
turn quickly about mentally and see whether you can ob- 
serve your thinking, feeling, or willing in the very act of 
taking place. 
6. What becomes of our mind or consciousness while we 
are asleep? How are we able to wake up at a certain hour 
previously determined? Can a person have absolutely nothing 
in his mind? 
7. Have you noticed any children especially adept in ex- 
pression? Have you noticed any very backward? If so, in 
what form of expression in each case? 
8. Have you observed any instances of expression which 
you were at a loss to interpret (remember that “expression” 
includes every form of physical action, voice, speech, face, 
form, hand, etc.) ?
-P-A-G-E-33
  CHAPTER II 
ATTENTION 
How do you rank in mental ability, and how effective 
are your mind’s grasp and power? ‘The answer that 
must be given to these questions will depend not more 
on your native endowment than on your skill in using 
attention. 
1, NATURE OF ATTENTION 
It is by attention that we gather and mass our mental 
energy upon the critical and important points in our 
thinking. In the last chapter we saw that consciousness 
is not distributed evenly over the whole field, but ‘‘piled 
up,’’ now on this object of thought, now on that, in 
obedience to interest or necessity. The concentration 
of the mind’s energy on one object of thought is atten- 
tion. : 
The Nature of Attention—Everyone knows what it is 
to attend. The story so fascinating that we cannot leave 
it, the critical points in a game, the interesting sermon 
or lecture, the sparkling conversation—all these compel 
our attention. So completely is our mind’s energy cen- 
tered on them and withdrawn from other things 
that we are scarcely aware of what is going on about 
us. 
We are also familiar with another kind of attention. 
For we all have read the dull story, watched the slow 
game, listened to the lecture or sermon that drags, and 
bb
-P-A-G-E-34
    16 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
taken part in conversation that was a bore. We gave 
these things our attention, but only with effort. Our 
mind’s energy seemed to center on anything rather than 
the matter in hand. A thousand objects from outside 
enticed us away, and it required the frequent ‘‘mental 
jerk’’ to bring us to the subject in hand. And when 
brought back to our thought problem we felt the con- 
stant ‘‘tug’’ of mind to be free again. 
Normal Consciousness Always in a State of Attention.— 
But this very effort of the mind to free itself from one 
object of thought that it may busy itself with another 
is because attention is solicited by this other. Some ob- 
ject in our field of consciousness is always exerting an 
appeal for attention; and to attend to one thing is 
always to attend away from a multitude of other things 
upon which the thought might rest. We may therefore 
say that attention is constantly selecting in our stream 
of thought those aspects that are to receive emphasis 
and consideration. From moment to moment it deter- 
mines the points at which our mental energy shall be 
centered. 
2. THE EFFECTS OF ATTENTION 
Attention Makes Its Object Clear and Definite.—What- 
ever attention centers upon stands out sharp and clear 
in consciousness. Whether it be a bit of memory, an 
“‘air-castle,’’ a sensation from an aching tooth, the rea- 
soning on an algebraic formula, a choice which we are 
making, the setting of an emotion—whatever be the ob- 
ject to which we are attending, that object is illumined 
and made to stand out from its fellows as the one 
prominent thing in the mind’s eye while the attention 
rests on it. It is like the one building which the search- 
light picks out among a city full of buildings and lights
-P-A-G-E-35
  ATTENTION i 
up, while the remainder are left in the semilight or in 
darkness. 
Attention Measures Mental Efficiency—In a state of 
attention the mind may be likened to the rays of the 
sun which have been passed through a burning glass. 
You may let all the rays which can pass through your 
window pane fall hour after hour upon the paper lying 
on your desk, and no marked effects follow. But let 
the same amount of sunlight be passed through a lens 
and converged to a point the size of your pencil point, 
and the paper will at once burst into flame. What the 
diffused rays could not do in hours or in ages is now 
accomplished in seconds. Likewise the mind, allowed 
to scatter over many objects, can accomplish but little. 
We may sit and dream away an hour or a day over a 
page or a problem without securing results. But let 
us call in our wits from their wool-gathering and ‘‘ buckle 
down to it’’ with all our might, withdrawing our 
thoughts from everything else but this one thing, and 
concentrating our mind on it. More can now be accom: 
plished in minutes than before in hours. Nay, things 
which could not be accomplished at all before now be- 
come possible. 
Again, the mind may be compared to a steam engine 
which is constructed to run at a certain pressure of 
steam, say one hundred and fifty pounds to the square 
inch of boiler surface. Once I ran such an engine; and 
well I remember a morning during my early apprentice- 
ship when the foreman called for power to run some of 
the lighter machinery, while my steam gauge registered 
but seventy-five pounds. ‘‘Surely,’’ I thought, ‘‘if one 
hundred and fifty pounds will run all this machinery, 
seventy-five pounds should run half of it,’’ so I opened 
the valve. But the powerful engine could do but little
-P-A-G-E-36
  18 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
more than turn its own wheels, and refused to do the 
required work. Not until the pressure had risen above 
one hundred pounds could the engine perform half the 
work which it could at one hundred and fifty pounds. 
And so with our mind. If it is meant to do its best work 
under a certain degree of concentration, it cannot in a 
given time do half the work with half the attention. 
Further, there will be much which it cannot do at all 
unless working under full pressure. We shall not be 
overstating the case if we say that as attention increases 
in arithmetical ratio, mental efficiency increases in geo- 
metrical ratio. It is in large measure a difference in 
the power of attention which makes one man a master in 
thought and achievement and another his humble fol- 
lower. One often hears it said that ‘‘genius is but the 
power of sustained attention,’’ and this statement pos- 
sesses a large element of truth. 
3. HOW WE ATTEND 
Someone has said that if our attention is properly 
trained we should be able ‘‘to look at the point of a 
eambric needle for half an hour without winking.’’ 
But this is a false idea of attention. The ability to 
look at the point of a cambric needle for half an hour 
might indicate a very laudable power of concentration; 
but the process, instead of enlightening us concerning the 
point of the needle, would result in our passing into a 
hypnotic state. Voluntary attention to any one object. 
can be sustained for but a brief time—a few seconds at 
best. It is essential that the object change, that we 
turn it over and over incessantly, and consider its vari- 
ous aspects and relations. Sustained voluntary atten- 
tion is thus a repetition of successive efforts to bring
-P-A-G-E-37
  ATTENTION 19 
back the object to the mind. Then the subject grows and 
develops—it is living, not dead. 
Attention a Relating Activity—When we are attend- 
ing strongly to one object of thought it does not mean 
that consciousness sits staring vacantly at this one ob- 
ject, but rather that it uses it as a central core of 
thought, and thinks into relation with this object the 
things which belong with it. In working out some mathe- 
matical solution the central core is the principle upon 
Fria. 4 
which the solution is based, and concentration in this 
case consists in thinking the various conditions of the 
problem in relation to this underlying principle. In the 
accompanying diagram (Fig. 4) let A be the central 
core of some object of thought, say a patch of cloud in 
a picture, and let a, b, c, d, ete., be the related facts, 
or the shape, size, color, etc., of the cloud. The arrows 
indicate the passing of our thought from cloud to related 
fact, or from related fact to cloud, and from related fact 
to related fact. As long as these related facts lead back 
to the cloud each time, that long we are attending to 
the cloud and thinking about it. It is when our thought 
fails to go back that we ‘‘wander’’ in our attention. 
Then we leave a, b, c, d, ete., which are related to the 
cloud, and, flying off to x, y, and z, finally bring up 
heaven knows where.
-P-A-G-E-38
  
  20 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION see 
The Rhythms of Attention.—Attention works in 
rhythms.\ This is to say that it mever maintains a con- 
stant level of concentration for any considerable length 
of time, but regularly ebbs and flows. The explanation 
of this rhythmic action would take us too far afield at 
this point. When we remember, however, that our entire 
organism works within a great system of rhythws— 
hunger, thirst, sleep, fatigue, and many others—it is 
easy to see that the same law may apply to attention. 
The rhythms of attention vary greatly, the fluctuations 
often being only a few seconds apart for certain simple 
sensations, and probably a much greater distance apart 
for the more complex. process of thinking. The seeming 
wariation in the sound of a distant waterfall, now loud 
and now faint, is caused by the rhythm of attention and 
easily allows us to measure the rhythm for this particular 
‘sensation. 
4. POINTS OF FAILURE IN ATTENTION 
Lack of Concentration.—There are two chief types of 
inattention whose danger threatens every person. First, 
we may be thinking about the right things, but not think- 
ing hard enough. We lack mental pressure. Outside 
thoughts which have no relation to the subject in hand 
may not trouble us much, but we do not attack our prob- 
lem with vim. The current in our stream of conscious- 
ness is moving too slowly. We do not gather up all our 
mental forces and mass them on the subject before us in 
a way that means victory. Our thoughts may be suf- 
ficiently focused, but they fail to ‘‘set fire.’’ It is like 
focusing the sun’s rays while an eclipse is on. They 
lack energy. They will not kindle the paper after they 
have passed through the lens. This kind of attention
-P-A-G-E-39
  ATTENTION 21 
means mental dawdling. It means inefficiency. For the 
individual it means defeat in life’s battles; for the nation 
“it means mediocrity and stagnation. 
A college professor said to his faithful but poorly 
prepared class, ‘‘Judging from your worn and tired 
appearance, young people, you are putting in twice too 
many,hours on study.’’ At this commendation the class 
brightened up visibly. ‘‘But,’’ he continued, ‘‘judging 
from your preparation, you do not study quite half hard 
enough.”’ 
Happy is the student who, starting in on his lesson 
rested and fresh, can study with such concentration 
that an hour of steady application will leave him men- 
tally exhausted and limp. That is one hour of triumph. 
for him, no matter what else he may have accomplished 
or failed to accomplish during the time. He can afford 
an occasional pause for rest, for difficulties will melt 
rapidly away before him. He possesses one key to suc- 
cessful achievement. 
Mental Wandering.—Second, we may have good men- 
tal power and be able to think hard and efficiently om 
any one point, but lack the power to think in a straight 
line. Every stray thought that comes along is a ‘‘will- 
o’-the-wisp’’ to lead us away from the subject in hand 
and into lines of thought not relating to it. Who has 
not started in to think on some problem, and, after a 
few moments, been surprised to find himself miles away 
from the topic upon which he started! Or who has not 
read down a page and, turning to the next, found that 
he did not know a word on the preceding page, his 
thoughts having wandered away, his eyes only going 
through the process of reading! Instead of sticking 
to the a, b, c, d, ete., of our topic and relating them 
all up to A, thereby reaching a solution of the problem,
-P-A-G-E-40
  22 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
we often jump at once to 2, y, z, and find ourselves far 
afield with all possibility of a solution gone. We may 
have brilliant thoughts about z, y, 2, but they are not 
related to anything in particular, and so they pass from 
us and are gone—lost in oblivion because they are not 
attached to something permanent. 
Such a thinker is at the mercy of circumstances, fol- 
lewing blindly the leadings of trains of thought which 
are his master instead of his servant, and which lead 
him anywhere or nowhere without let or hindrance from 
him. His consciousness moves rapidly enough and with 
enough force, but it is like a ship without a helm. Start- 
ing for the intellectual port A by way of a, b, c, d, 
he is mentally shipwrecked at last on the rocks 2, y, 2} 
and never reaches harbor. Fortunate is he who can 
shut out intruding thoughts and think in a straight 
line. Even with mediocre ability he may accomplish 
more by his thinking than the brilliant thinker who is 
constantly having his mental train wrecked by stray 
thoughts which slip in on his right of way. 
5. TYPES OF ATTENTION 
The Three Types of Attention.—Attention may be se- 
cured in three ways: (1) It is demanded by some 
sudden or intense sensory stimulus or insistent idea, 
or (2) it follows interest, or (3) it is compelled 
by the will. If it comes in the first way, as from a 
thunderclap or a flash of light, or from the persistent 
attempt of some unsought idea to secure entrance into 
the mind, it is called involuntary attention. This form 
of attention is of so little importance, comparatively, in 
our mental life that we shall not discuss it further. 
If attention comes in the second way, following in-
-P-A-G-E-41
        ATTENTION 23 
    terest, it is called nonvoluntary or spontaneous atten- 
tion; if in the third, compelled by the will, voluntary 
or active attention: Nonvoluntary attention has its mo- 
tive in some object external to consciousness, or else 
follows a more or less uncontrolled current of thought 
which interests us; voluntary attention is controlled 
from within—we decide what we shall attend to instead 
of letting interesting objects of thought determine” it 
for us. 
Interest and Nonvoluntary Attention—In nonvolun- 
tary attention the énvironment largely determines what 
we shall attend to. All that we have to do with directing 
this kind of attention is in developing certain lines of 
interest, and then the interesting things attract atten- 
tion. The things we see and hear and touch and taste 
and smell, the things we like, the things we do and 
hope to do—these are the determining factors in our 
mental life so long as we are giving nonvoluntary atten- 
tion. Our attention follows the beckoning of these 
things as the needle the magnet. It is no effort to attend 
to them, but rather the effort would be to keep from at- 
tending to them. Who does not remember reading a 
story, perhaps a forbidden one, so interesting that when 
mother called up the stairs for us to come down to attend 
to some duty, we replied, ‘‘Yes, in a minute,’’ and then 
went on reading! We simply could not stop at that 
place. The minute lengthens into ten, and another call 
startles us. ‘‘Yes, I’m coming ;’’ we turn just one more 
leaf, and are lost again. At last comes a third call in 
tones so imperative that it cannot be longer ignored, and 
we lay the book down, but open to the place where we 
left off, and where we hope soon to begin further to 
unravel the delightful mystery. Was it an effort to 
attend to the reading? Ah, no! it took the combined 
    
-P-A-G-E-42
    24 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
force of our will and of mother’s authority to drag 
the attention away. This is nonvoluntary attention. 
Left to itself, then, attention simply obeys natural 
laws and follows the line of least resistance. By far 
the larger portion of our attention is of this type. 
Thought often runs on hour after hour when we are 
not conscious of effort or struggle to compel us to 
cease thinking about this thing and begin thinking about 
that. Indeed, it may be doubted whether this is not 
the case with some persons for days at a time, instead 
of hours. The things that present themselves to the 
mind are the things which occupy it; the character of 
the thought is determined by the character of our in- 
terests. It is this fact which makes it vitally neces- 
sary that our interests shall be broad and pure if our 
thoughts are to be of this type. It is not enough that 
we have the strength to drive from our minds a wrong 
or impure thought which seeks entrance. To stand 
guard as a policeman over our thoughts to see that no 
unworthy one enters, requires too much time and energy. 
Our interests must be of such a nature as to lead us 
away from the field of unworthy thoughts if we are 
to be free from their tyranny. 
The Will and Voluntary Attention—In voluntary at- 
tention there is a conflict either between the will and 
interest or between the will and the mental inertia 
or laziness, which has to be overcome before we can 
think with any degree of concentration. Interest says, 
“Follow this line, which is easy and attractive, or which 
requires but little effort—follow the line of least re- 
sistance.’’ Will says, ‘‘Quit that line of dalliance and 
ease, and take this harder way which I direct—cease 
the line of least resistance and take the one of greatest 
resistance.’? When day dreams and ‘‘castles in Spain’’

attempt to lure you from your lessons, refuse to follow; 
shut out these vagabond thoughts and stick to your 
task. When intellectual inertia deadens your thought 
and clogs your mental stream, throw it off and court 
forceful effort. If wrong or impure thoughts seek en- 
trance to your mind, close and lock your mental doors 
to them. If thoughts of desire try to drive out thoughts 
of duty, be heroic and insist that thoughts of duty shall 
have right of way. In short, see that you are the master 
of your thinking, and do not let it always be directed 
without your consent by influences outside of yourself. 
It is just at this point that the strong will wins vic- 
tory and the weak will breaks down. Between the abil- 
ity to control one’s thoughts and the inability to control 
them lies all the difference between right actions and 
wrong actions; between withstanding temptation and 
yielding to it; between an inefficient purposeless life 
and a life of purpose and endeavor ; between success and 
failure. For we act in accordance with those things 
which our thought rests upon. Suppose two lines of 
thought represented by A and B, respectively, lie before 
you; that A leads to a course of action difficult or un- 
pleasant, but necessary to success or duty, and that B 
leads to a course of action easy or pleasant, but fatal 
to suecess or duty. Which course will you follow—the 
rugged path of duty or the easier one of pleasure? 
The answer depends almost wholly, if not entirely, on 
your power of attention. If your will is strong enough 
to pull your thoughts away from the fatal but attractive 
B and hold them resolutely_on the less attractive A, 
then A will dictate your course of action, and you will 
respond to the call for endeavor, self-denial, and duty; 
but if your thoughts break away from the domination 
of your will and allow the beckoning of your interests 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
  26 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
alone, then B will dictate your course of action, and 
you will follow the leading of ease and pleasure. For 
our actions are finally and irrevocably dictated by the 
things we think about. 
Not Really Different Kinds of Attention—It is not to 
be understood, however, from what has been said, that 
there are really different kinds of attention. All atten- 
tion denotes an active or dynamic phase of conscious- 
ness. The difference is rather in the way we secure 
attention; whether it is demanded by sudden stimulus, 
coaxed from us by interesting objects of thought without 
effort on our part, or compelled by force of will to desert 
the more interesting and take the direction which we 
dictate. 
6. IMPROVING THE POWER OF ATTENTION 
While attention is no doubt partly a natural gift, 
yet there is probably no power of the mind more sus- 
ceptible to training than is attention. And with atten- 
tion, as with every other power of body and mind, the 
secret of its development lies in its use. Stated briefly, 
the only way to train attention is by attending. No 
amount of theorizing or resolving can take the place 
of practice in the actual process of attending. 
Making Different Kinds of Attention Reénforce Each 
Other.—A very close relationship and interdependence 
exists between nonvoluntary and voluntary attention. 
It would be impossible to hold our attention by sheer 
force of will on objects which were forever devoid of 
interest; likewise the blind following of our interests 
and desires would finally lead to shipwreck in all our 
lives. Each kind of attention must support and re- 
enforce the other. The lessons, the sermons, the lec-
-P-A-G-E-45
  ATTENTION 27 
tures, and the books in which we are most interested, 
and hence to which we attend nonvoluntarily and with 
the least effort and fatigue, are the ones out of which, 
other things being equal, we get the most and remember 
the best and longest. On the other hand, there are 
sometimes lessons and lectures and books, and many 
things besides, which are not intensely interesting, but 
which should be attended to nevertheless. It is at this 
point that the will must step in and take command. If 
it has not the strength to do this, it is in so far a weak 
will, and steps should be taken to develop it. We are 
to ‘‘keep the faculty of effort alive in us by a little 
gratuitous exercise every day.’’ We are to be sys- 
tematically heroic in the little points of everyday life 
and experience. We are not to shrink’ from tasks be- 
cause they are difficult or unpleasant. Then, when 
the test comes, we shall not find ourselves unnerved 
and untrained, but shall be able to stand in the evil 
day. 
The Habit of Attention—Finally, one of the chief 
things in training the attention is to form the habit of 
attending. )This habit is to be formed only by attending 
whenever and wherever the proper thing to do is to 
attend, whether ‘‘in work, in play, in making fishing 
flies, in preparing for an examination, in courting a 
sweetheart, in reading a book.’’ The lesson, or the 
sermon, or the lecture, may not be very interesting; 
but if they are to. be attended to at all, our rule should 
be to attend to them completely and absolutely. Not 
by fits and starts, now drifting away and now jerking 
ourselves back, but all the time. And, furthermore, the 
one who will deliberately do this will often find the dull 
and uninteresting task become more interesting; but if 
it never becomes interesting, he is at least forming a
-P-A-G-E-46
  28 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
habit which will be invaluable to him through life. On 
the other hand, the one who fails to attend except 
when his interest is captured, who never exerts effort 
to compel attention, is forming a habit which will be 
the bane of his thinking until his stream of thought 
shall end. 
7. PROBLEMS IN OBSERVATION AND INTROSPECTION 
1. Which fatigues you more, to give attention of the non- 
voluntary type, or the voluntary? Which can you maintain 
longer? Which is the more pleasant and agreeable to give? 
Under which can you accomplish more? What bearing have 
these facts on teaching? 
2. Try to follow for one or two minutes the “wave” in 
your consciousness, and then describe the course taken by 
your attention. 
3. Have you observed one class alert in attention, and 
another lifeless and inattentive? Can you explain the causes 
lying back of this difference? Estimate the relative amount 
of work accomplished under the two conditions. 
4. What distractions have you observed in the schoolroom 
tending to break up attention? 
5. Have you seen pupils inattentive from lack of (1) 
change, (2) pure air, (3) enthusiasm on the part of the 
teacher, (4) fatigue, (5) ill health? 
6. Have you noticed a difference in the habit of attention 
in different pupils? Have you noticed the same thing for 
whole schools or rooms? 
7. Do you know of children too much given to day- 
dreaming? Are you? 
8. Have you seen a teacher rap the desk for attention? 
What type of attention was secured? Does it pay? 
9. Have you observed any instance in which pupils’ lack 
of attention should be blamed on the teacher? If so, what 
was the fault? The remedy?

10. Visit a school room or a recitation, and then write 
an account of the types and degrees of attention you observed. 
Try to explain the factors responsible for any failures in 
attention, and also those responsible for the good attention 
shown.

THE BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM 
A FINE brain, or a good mind. These terms are often 
used interchangeably, as if they stood for the same 
thing. Yet the brain is material substance—so many 
cells and fibers, a_pul rotoplasmic mass weighing 
some three pounds and.shut away from the outside world 
in a casket of bone. (The mind is a spiritual thing—the 
sum of the processes by which we think and feel and

1. THE RELATIONS OF MIND AND BRAIN | 
Interaction of Mind and Brain.—How, then, come these 
two widely different facts, mind and brain, to be so 
related in our speech? Why are the terms so com- 
monly interchanged ?—It is because mind and brain are 
so vitally related in their processes and’ so inseparably 
connected in their work. No movement of our thought, 
no bit of sensation, no memory, no feeling, no act of 
decision but is accompanied by its own particular activ- 
ity in the cells of the brain. It is this that the psychol- 
ogist has in mind when he says, no psychosis without 
its corresponding neurosis. 
So far as our present existence is concerned, then, 
no mind ever works except through some brain a 
brain without a mind becomes but a mass of dead matter,

so much clay. Mind and brain are perfectly adapted 
to each other. Nor is this mere accident. For through 
the ages of man’s past history each has grown up 
and developed into its present state of efficiency by 
working in conjunction with the other. Hach has 
helped form the other and determine its qualities. 
Not only is this true for the race in its evolution, 
but for every individual as he passes from infancy to 
maturity. 
The Brain as the Mind’s Machine.—In the first chapter 
we saw that the brain does not create the mind, but 
that the mind works through the brain. No one can 
believe that the brain secretes mind as the liver secretes 
bile, or that it grinds it out as a mill does flour. Indeed, 
just what their exact, relation is has not yet been settled. 
Yet it is easy to see that if the mind must use the brain 
as a machine and work through it, then the mind must. 
be GS to the limitations of its machine, or;*in other 
words, the mind cannot be better than the brain through 
which if operates. A brain and nervous system that

  32 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
2. THE MIND’S DEPENDENCE ON THE EXTERNAL 
WORLD 
But can we first see how in a general way the brain 
and nervous system are primarily related to our think- 
ing? Let us go back to the beginning and consider the 
babe when it first opens its eyes on the scenes of its new 
existence. What is in its mind? What does it think 
about? Nothing. Imagine, if you can, a person born 
blind and deaf, and without the sense of touch, taste, or 
smell. Let such a person live on for a year, for five 
years, for a lifetime. What would he know? What ray 
of intelligence would enter his mind? What would 
he think about? All would be dark to his eyes, all silent 
to his ears, all tasteless to his mouth, all odorless to 
his nostrils, all touchless to his skin. His mind would 
be a blank. He would have no mind. He could not 
get started to think. He could not get started to act. 
He would belong to a lower scale of life than the tiny 
animal that floats with the waves and the tide in the 
ocean without power to direct its own course. He 
would be but an inert mass of flesh without sense or 
intelligence. 
The Mind at Birth—Yet this is the condition of the 
babe at birth. It is born practically blind and deaf, 
without definite sense of taste or smell. Born without 
anything to think about, and no way to get anything to 
think about until the senses wake up and furnish some 
material from the outside world. Born with all the 
mechanism of muscle and nerve ready to perform the 
countless complex movements of arms and legs and body 
which characterize every child, he could not successfully 
start these activtities without a message from the senses 
to set them going. At birth the child Dyobably has only 
iq

  THE BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM 33 
the senses of contact and temperature present with any 
degree of clearness; taste soon follows; vision of an 
imperfect sort in a few days; hearing about the same 
time, and smell a little later. The senses are waking 
up and beginning their acquaintance with the outside 
world. 
The Work of the Senses—And what a problem the 
senses have to solve! On the one hand the great uni-

verse of sights and sounds, of tastes and smells, of con-

to the material world in which we live; and on the 
other hand the little shapeless mass of gray and white 
pulpy matter called the brain, incapable of sustaining 
its own shape, shut away in the darkness of a bony 
case with no possibility of contact with the outside 
world, and possessing no means of communicating with 
it except through the senses. And yet this universe 
of external things must be brought into communication

brain, a the mind could never be. Here we discover, 
then, thé two great factors which first require our study 
if we would understand the growth of the, mind—the 
material world without, and the brain within. For it is 
the action and interaction of these which lie at the bottom 
of the mind’s development. Let us first look a little 
more closely at the brain and the accompanying nervous 
system. 
3. STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 
It will help in understanding both the structure and 
the working of the nervous system to keep in mind that 
it contains but one fundamental unit of structure. [ This 
is the neurone. Just as the house is built up by adding

brick upon brick, so, brain, cord, nerves and organs 
of sense are formed by the union of numberless 
neurones. i : 
The Neurone. —What, then, is a neurone? What is 
_« its structure, its function, how does it act? A neurone
-P-A-G-E-53
  THE BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM 35 
is a protoplasmic cell, with its outgrowing fibers. The 
cell part of the neurone is of a variety of shapes, tri- 
angular, pyramidal, cylindrical, and irregular. The cells 
vary in size from 1/250 to 1/3500 of an inch in diameter. 
In general the function of the cell is thought to be to 
generate the nervous energy responsible for our con- 
sciousness—sensation, memory, reasoning, feeling and all 
the rest, and for our movements. The cell also provides 
for the nutrition of the fibers.

Fic. 7.—Longitudinal (A) and transverse (B) section of nerve fiber. 
The heavy border represents the medullary, or enveloping sheath, 
which becomes thicker in the larger fibers.—After DoNALDSON. 
Neurone Fibers.—The neurone fibers are of two kinds, 
dendrites and axons. The dendrites are comparatively 
large in diameter, branch freely, like the branches of 
a tree, and extend but a relatively short distance from 
the parent cell. Axons are slender, and branch but 
little, and then approximately at right angles. They 
reach a much greater distance from the cell body than 
the dendrites. Neurones vary greatly in length. Some 
of those found in the spinal cord and brain are not more 
than 1/12 of an inch long, while others which reach 
from the extremities to the cord, measure several feet. 
Both dendrites and axons are of diameter so small as to 
be invisible except under the microscope. 
Neuroglia.—Out of this simple structural element, the 
neurone, the entire nervous system is built. True, the 
neurones are held.in place, and perhaps insulated, by a 
kind of soft cement called neuroglia. But this seems to 
possess no strictly nervous function. The number of the ,
-P-A-G-E-54
  36 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
microscopic neurones required to make up the mass of 
the brain, cord and peripheral nervous system is far 
beyond our mental grasp. It is computed that the brain 
and cord contain some 3,000 millions of them. 
‘ity of the brain structure can best be understood by an 
illustration. Professor Stratton estimates that if we 
were to make a model of the human brain, using for the 
neurone fibers wires so small as to be barely visible to 
the eye, in order to find room for all the wires the model 
would need to be the size of a city block on the base and 
correspondingly high. Imagine a telephone system of 
this complexity operating from one switch-board! 
“ ” and “White” Matter—The ‘‘gray matter’’ of 
the brain and cord is made up of nerve cells and their 
dendrites, and the terminations of axons, which enter 
from the adjoining white matter. A part of the mass of 
gray matter also consists of the neuroglia which sur- 
rounds the nerve cells and fibers, and a net-work of 
blood vessels. The ‘‘white matter’’ of the central sys- 
tem consists chiefly of axons with their enveloping or 
medullary, sheath and neuroglia. The white matter 
contains no nerve cells or dendrites. The difference in 
color of the gray and the white matter is caused chiefly 
by the fact that in the gray masses the medullary sheath, 
which is white, is lacking, thus revealing the ashen gray 
of the nerve threads. In the white masses the medullary 
sheath is present. :     
              
4, GROSS STRUCTURE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 
Divisions of the Nervous System.—The nervous system 
may be considered in two divisions: (1) The central 
system, which consists of the brain and spinal cord, and
-P-A-G-E-55
  THE BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM 37 
(2) the peripheral system, which comprises the sensory 
and motor neurones connecting the periphery and the 
internal organs with the central system and the special- 
ized end-organs of the senses. The sympathetic system, 
which is found as a double chain of nerve connections 
joining the roots of sensory and motor nerves just out- 
side the spinal column, does not seem to be directly re- 
lated to consciousness and so will not be discussed here. 
A brief description of the nervous system will help us 
better to understand how its parts all work together in 
so wonderful a way to accomplish their great result. 
The Central System.—In the brain we easily distin- 
guish three major divisions—the cerebrum, the cerebel- 
lum and the medulla oblongata. The medulla is but the 
enlarged upper part of the cord where it connects with . 
the brain. It is about an inch and a quarter long, 
and is composed of both medullated and unmedullated 
fibers—that is of both ‘‘white’’ and ‘‘gray’”’ matter. In 
the medulla, the unmedullated neurones which com- 
prise the center of the cord are passing to the outside; 
and the medullated to the inside, thus taking the posi- 
tions they occupy in the cerebrum. Here also the 
neurones are crossing, or changing sides, so that those 
which pass up the right side of the cord finally connect 
with the left side of the brain, and vice versa. : 
The Cerebellum.—Lying just back of the medulla and 
at the rear part of the base of the cerebrum is the cere- 
bellum, or ‘‘little brain,’’ approximately as large as the 
fist, and composed of a complex arrangement of white 
and gray matter. Fibers from the spinal cord enter this 
mass, and others emerge and pass on into the cerebrum, 
while its two halves also are connected with each other 
by means of cross fibers. 
The Cerebrum.—The cerebrum occupies all the upper
-P-A-G-E-56
  38 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
part of the skull from the front to the rear. It is divided 
symmetrically into two hemispheres, the right and the 
left. These hemispheres are connected with each other 
by a small bridge of fibers called the corpus callosum. 
Each hemisphere is furrowed and ridged with convolu-

tions, an arrangement which allows greater surface for 
fhe’ distribution of the gray cellular matter over it. Be- 
sides these irregularities of surface, each hemisphere 
is marked also by two deep clefts or fisswres—the fissure 
of: Rolando, extending from the middle upper part of 
the hemisphere downward and forward, passing a little 
in front of the ear and stopping on a level with the* 
upper part of it; and the fissure of Sylvius, beginning 
at the base of the brain somewhat in front of the ear
-P-A-G-E-57

. and extending upward and backward at an acute angle 
with the base of the hemisphere. 
The surface of each hemisphere may be thought of 
as mapped out into four lobes: The frontal lobe, which 
includes the front part of the hemisphere and extends

extends back to the occipital lobe. 
“| The Cortex.—The gray matter of the hemispheres, un- 
like that of the cord, lies on the surface. This gray ex- 
terior portion of the cerebrum is called the cortex, and

  40 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
varies from one-twelfth to one-eighth of an inch in thick- 
ness. The cortex is the seat of all consciousness and of 
the control of voluntary movement. 
The Spinal Cord.—The spinal cord proceeds from the 
base of the brain downward about eighteen inches 
through a canal provided for it in the vertebre of the 
spinal column. It is composed of white matter on the

outside, and gray matter within. A deep fissure on the 
anterior side and another on the posterior cleave the 
cord nearly in twain, resembling the brain in this par- 
ticular. The gray matter on the interior is in the form 
of two crescents connected by a narrow bar. 
The peripheral nervous system consists of thirty-one 
pairs of nerves, with their end-organs, branching off 
from the cord, and twelve pairs that have their roots in 
the brain. Branches of these forty-three pairs of nerves 
reach to every part of the periphery of the body and 
to all the internal organs.
-P-A-G-E-59
THE BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM 41 
It will help in understanding the peripheral system 
to remember that a nerve consists of a bundle of neurone 
fibers each wrapped in its medullary sheath and sheath 
of Schwann. Around this bundle of neurones, that is 
around the nerve, is still another wrapping, silvery- 
white, called the neurilemma. The number of fibers

going to make up a nerve varies from about 5,000 to 
100,000. Nerves can easily be identified in a piece of 
lean beef, or even at the edge of a serious gash in one’s 
own flesh! 
Bundles of sensory fibers constituting a sensory nerve 
root enter the spinal cord on the posterior side through 
holes in the vertebre. Similar bundles of motor fibers 
in the form of a motor nerve root emerge from the cord 
at the same level. Soon after their emergence from the 
cord, these two nerves are wrapped together in the

same sheath and proceed in this way to the periphery 
of the body, where the sensory nerve usually ends in a 
specialized end-organ fitted to respond to some certain 
stimulus from the outside world. The motor nerve ends 
in minute filaments in the muscular organ which it gov- 
erns. Both sensory and motor nerves connect with fibers 
of like kind in the cord and these in turn with the

cortex, thus giving every part of the periphery direct 
connection with the cortex. 
The end-organs of the sensory nerves are nerve masses, 
some of them, as the taste buds of the tongue, relatively 
simple; and others, as the eye or ear, very complex. 
They are all alike in one particular; namely, that each

other. Thus the eye is the end-organ of sight, and is 
a wonderfully complex arrangement of nerve structure 
combined with refracting media, and arranged to re- 
spond to the rapid ether waves of light. The ear has

-P-A-G-E-61
  THE BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM 43 
for its essential part the specialized endings of the audi- 
tory nerve, and is fitted to respond to the waves car- 
ried to it in the air, giving the sensation of sound. The 
end-organs of touch, found in greatest perfection in 
the finger tips, are of several kinds, all very complicated 
in structure. And so on with each of the senses. (Each 
particular sense has some form of end-organ specially 
adapted to respond to the kind of stimulus upon which 
its sensation depends, and each is insensible to the stim- 
uli of the others, much as the receiver of a telephone will 
respond to the tones of our voice, but not to the touch 
of our fingers as will the telegraph instrument, and vice 
versa. Thus the eye is not affected by sounds, nor touch 
by light. Yet by means of all the senses together: we 
are able to come in contact with the material world in 
a variety of ways. 
5. LOCALIZATION OF FUNCTION IN THE NERVOUS 
SYSTEM 
Division of Labor.—Division of labor is the law in the 
organic world as in the industrial. Animals of the low- 
est type, such as the amceba, do not have separate organs 
for respiration, digestion, assimilation, elimination, etc., 
" the one tissue performing all of these functions. But in 
the higher forms each organ not only has its own specific 
work, but even within the same organ each part has its 
own particular function assigned. Thus we have seen 
that the two parts of the neurone probably perform 
different functions, the cells generating energy and the 
fibers transmitting it. 
It will not seem strange, then, that there is also a 
division of labor in the cellular matter itself in the 
nervous system. For example, the little masses of ganglia 
~ ey
-P-A-G-E-62
  Frontat- 44 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
which are distributed at intervals along the nerves are 
probably for the purpose of reénforcing the nerve cur- 
rent, much as the battery cells in the local telegraph 
office reénforce the current from the central office. The 
cellular matter in the spinal cord and lower parts of the 
brain has a very important work to perform in receiv- 
ing messages from the senses and responding to them in

directing the simpler reflex acts and movements which 
we learn to execute without our consciousness being 
called upon, thus leaving the mind free from these petty 
things to busy itself in higher ways. The cellular mat- 
ter of the cortex performs the highest functions of all, 
for through its activity we have consciousness. 
The gray matter of the cerebellum, the medulla, and 
the cord may receive impressions from the senses and 
respond to them with movements, but their response is 
in all cases wholly automatic and unconscious. A person
-P-A-G-E-63
  THE BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM 45 
whose hemispheres had been injured in such a way as to 
interfere with the activity of the cortex might still con- 
tinue to perform most if not all of the habitual move- 
ments of his life, but they would be mechanical and 
not intelligent. He would lack all higher consciousness. 
It is through the activity of this thin covering of eel- 
lular matter of the cerebrum, the cortex, that our minds 
operate; here are received stimuli from the different 
senses, and here sensations are experienced. Here all 
our movements which are consciously directed have their 
origin. And here all our thinking, feeling, and willing 
are done. 
Division of Labor in the Cortex.—Nor does the division 
of labor in the nervous system end with this assignment 
of work. The cortex itself probably works essentially 
as a unit, yet it is through a shifting of tensions from 
one area to another that it acts, now giving us a sensa- 
tion, now directing a movement, and now thinking a 
thought or feeling an emotion. Localization of function 
is the rule here also. Certain areas of the cortex are 
devoted chiefly to sensations, others to motor impulses, 
and others to higher thought activities, yet in such a 
way that all work together in perfect harmony, each 
reénforcing the other and making its work significant. 
Thus the front portion of the cortex seems to be devoted 
to the higher thought activities; the region on both 
sides of the fissure of Rolando, to motor activities; and 
the rear and lower parts to sensory activities; and all 
are bound together and made to work together by the 
association fibers of the brain. 
In the ease of the higher thought activities, it is not. 
probable that one section of the frontal lobes of the 
cortex is set apart for thinking, one for feeling, and 
one for willing, etc., but rather that the whole frontal.
-P-A-G-E-64
  ¢ 
46 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
part of the cortex is concerned in each. In the motor 
and sensory areas, however, the case is different; for 
here a still further division of labor occurs. For ex- 
ample, in the motor region one small area seems con- 
nected with movements of the head, one with the arm, 
one with the leg, one with the face, and another with 
the organs of speech ; likewise in the sensory region, one 
area is devoted to vision, one to hearing, one to taste 
and smell, and one to touch, etc. We must bear in 
mind, however, that these regions are not mapped out 
as accurately as are the boundaries of our states—that 
no part of the brain is restricted wholly to either sensory 
or motor nerves, and that no part works by itself inde- 
pendently of the rest of the brain. We name a tract 
from the predominance of nerves which end there, or 
from the chief functions which the area performs. The 
motor localization seems to be the most perfect. Indeed, 
experimentation on the brains of monkeys has been suc- 
cessful in mapping out motor areas so accurately that 
such small centers as those connected with the bending 
of one particular leg or the flexing of a thumb have been 
located. Yet each area of the cortex is so connected 
with every other area by the millions of association 
fibers that the whole brain is capable of working together 
as a unit, thus unifying and harmonizing our thoughts, 
emotions, and acts. 
6. FORMS OF SENSORY STIMULI 
Let us next inquire how this mechanism of the nervous 
system is acted upon in such a way as to give us sensa- 
tions. In order to understand this, we must first know 
that all forms of matter are composed of minute atoms 
which are in constant motion, and by imparting this
-P-A-G-E-65
THE BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM AT 
motion to the air or the ether which surrounds them, 
are constantly radiating energy in the form of minute 
waves throughout space. These waves, or radiations, 
are incredibly rapid in some instances and rather slow 
in others. In sending out its energy in the form of 
these waves, the physical world is doing its part to 
permit us to form its acquaintance. The end-organs 
of the sensory nerves must meet this advance half-way, 
and be so constructed as to be affected by the different 
forms of energy which are constantly beating upon 
them. 
The End-organs and Their Response to Stimuli—Thus 
the radiations of ether from the sun, our chief source 
of light, are so rapid that billions of them enter the eye

that its nerve cells are thrown into activity by these 
waves; the impulse is carried over the optic nerve to 
the occipital lobe of the cortex, and the sensation of sight 
is the result, The different colors also, from the red
-P-A-G-E-66
  48 THE MIND AND ITS per 
of the spectrum to the violet, are the result of different 
vibration rates in the waves of ether which strike the 
retina; and in order to perceive color, the retina must 
be able to respond to the particular vibration rate which 
represents each color. Likewise in the sense of touch 
the end-organs are fitted to respond to very rapid 
vibrations, and it is possible that the different qualities 
of touch are produced by different vibration rates in 
the atoms of the object we are touching. When we reach 
the ear, we have the organ which responds to the lowest 
vibration rate of all, for we can detect a sound made 
by an object which is vibrating from twenty to thirty 
times a second. The highest vibration rate which will 
affect the ear is some forty thousand per second. 
Thus it is seen that there are great gaps in the different 
rates to which our senses are fitted to respond—a sudden 
drop from billions in the case of the eye to millions in 
touch, and to thousands or even tens in hearing. This 
makes one wonder whether there are: not many things 
in nature which man has never discovered simply be- 
eause he has not the sense mechanism enabling him to 
become conscious of their existence. There are undoubt- 
edly ‘‘more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt 
of in our philosophy.”’ 
Dependence of the Mind on the Senses.—Only as the 
senses bring in the material, has the mind anything 
with which to build. Thus have the senses to act as 
messengers between the great outside world and the 
brain; to be the servants who shall stand at the door- 
ways of the body—the eyes, the ears, the finger tips— 
each ready to receive its particular kind of impulse from 
nature and send it along the right path to the part of 
the cortex where it belongs, so that the mind can say, 
“*A sight,’’ ‘A sound,’’ or ‘‘A touch.’’ Thus does the
-P-A-G-E-67
  THE BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM 49 
mind come to know the universe of the senses. Thus 
does it get the material out of which memory, imagina- 
tion, and thought begin. Thus and only thus does the 
mind secure the crude material from which the finished 
superstructure is finally built.
-P-A-G-E-68
  CHAPTER IV 
MENTAL DEVELOPMENT AND MOTOR TRAINING 
Epucation was long looked upon as affecting the mind 
only; the body was either left out of account or neg- 
lected. Later science has shown, however, that the mind 
cannot be trained except as the nervous system is 
trained and developed. For not sensation and the sim- 
pler mental processes alone, but memory, imagination, 
judgment, reasoning and every other act of the mind 
are dependent on the nervous system finally for their 
efficiency. The little child gets its first mental experi- 
ences in connection with certain movements or acts set 
up reflexly by the pre-organized nervous system. From 
this time on movement and idea are so inextricably 
bound together that they cannot be separated. The 
mind and the brain are so vitally related that it is 
impossible to educate one without performing a like 
office for the other; and it is likewise impossible to 
neglect the one without causing the other to suffer in 
its development. 
1. FACTORS DETERMINING THE EFFICIENCY OF THE 
NERVOUS SYSTEM 
Development and Nutrition—Ignoring the native dif- 
, ferences in nervous systems through the influence of 
heredity, the efficiency of a nervous system is largely 
dependent on two factors: (1) The development of the 
50
-P-A-G-E-69
  
MENTAL DEVELOPMENT AND MOTOR TRAINING 51 
cells and fibers of which it is composed, and (2) its 
general tone of health and vigor. The actual number 
of cells in the nervous system increases but little if at all 
after birth. Indeed, it is doubtful whether Edison’s 
brain and nervous system has a greater number of 
cells in it than yours or mine. The difference between 
the brain of a genius and that of an ordinary man is 
not in the number of cells which it contains, but rather 
in the development of the cells and fibers which are 
present, potentially, at least, in every nervous system. 
The histologist tells us that in the nervous system of 
every child there are tens of thousands of cells which 
are so immature and undeveloped that they are use- 
less ; indeed, this is the case to some degree in every adult 
person’s nervous system as well. Thus each individual 
has inherent in his nervous system potentialities of which 
he has never taken advantage, the utilizing of which may 
make him a genius and the neglecting of which, will cer- 
tainly leave him on the plane of mediocrity. (The first 
problem in education, then, is to take the unripe and 
inefficient nervous system and so develop it in con- 
nection with the growing mind that the possibilities 
which nature has stored in it shall become actualities. 
Undeveloped Cells——Professor Donaldson tells us on 
this point that: ‘‘At birth, and for a long time after, 
many [nervous] systems contain cell elements which are 
more or less immature, not forming a functional part 
of the tissue, and yet under some conditions capable 
of further development. ... For the cells which are 
continually appearing in the developing cortex no other 
source is known than the nuclei or granules found 
there in its earliest stages. These elements are meta- 
morphosed neuroblasts—that is, elementary cells out of 
which the nervous matter is developed—which have  
-P-A-G-E-70
  52 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
shrunken to a volume less than that which they had at 
first, and which remain small until, in the subsequent 
process of enlargement necessary for their full develop- 
ment, they expand into well-marked cells. Elements in- 
termediate between these granules and the fully devel- 
oped cells are always found, even in mature brains, and 
therefore it is inferred that the latter are derived from 
the former. The appearances there also lead to the 
eonclusion that many elements which might possibly 
develop in any given case are far beyond the number 
that actually does so. . . . The possible number cf cells 
latent and functional in the central system is early fixed. 
At any age this number is accordingly represented by 
the granules as well as by the cells which have already 
undergone further development. During growth the 
proportion of developed cells increases, and sometimes, 
owing to the failure to recognize potential nerve cells in 
the granules, the impression is carried away that this 
inerease implies the formation of new elements. As has 
been shown, such is not the case.’’* 
Development of Nerve Fibers.—The nerve fibers, no less 
than the cells, must go through a process of development. 
It has already been shown that the fibers are the result 
of a branching of cells. At birth many of the cells 
have not yet thrown out branches, and hence the fibers 
are lacking; while many of those which are already 
grown out are not sufficiently developed to transmit 
impulses accurately. Thus it has been found that most 
children at birth are able to support the weight of the 
body for several seconds by clasping the fingers around 
a small rod, but it takes about a year for the child 
to become able to stand. It is evident that it requires 
more actual strength to cling to a rod than to stand; 
1 Donaldson, “The Growth of the Brain,” pp. 74, 238. 
 
-P-A-G-E-71
  MENTAL DEVELOPMENT AND MOTOR TRAINING 53 
hence the conclusion is that the difference is in the 
earlier development of the nerve centers which have to 
do with clasping than of those concerned in standing. 
Likewise the child’s first attempts to feed himself or 
do any one of the thousand little things about which 
he is so awkward, are partial failures not so much be- 
cause he has not had practice as because his nervous 
machinery connected with those movements is not yet 
developed sufficiently to enable him to be accurate. 
His brain is in a condition which Flechsig calls ‘‘un- 
ripe.’’ How, then, shall the undeveloped cells and sys- 
tem ripen? How shall the undeveloped cells and fibers 
grow to full maturity and efficiency ? 
2. DEVELOPMENT OF NERVOUS SYSTEM THROUGH 
USE 
Importance of Stimulus and Response.—Like all other 
tissues of the body, the nerve cells and fibers are de- 
veloped by judicious use. The sensory and association 
centers require the constant stimulus of nerve currents 
running in from the various end-organs, and the motor 
centers require the constant stimulus of currents run- 
ning from them out to the muscles. In other words, the 
conditions upon which both motor and sensory develop- 
ment depend are: (1) A rich environment of sights and 
sounds and tastes and smells, and everything else which 
serves as proper stimulus to the sense organs, and to 
every form of intellectual and social interest; and (2) 
no less important, an opportunity for the freest and 
most complete forms of response and motor activity. 
An illustration of the effects of the lack of sensory 
stimuli on the cortex is well shown in the case of Laura 
Bridgman, whose brain was studied by Professor Don-
-P-A-G-E-72
  54 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
aldson after her death. Laura Bridgman was born a 
normal child, and developed as other children do up to 
the age of nearly three years. At this time, through an

attack of scarlet fever, she lost her hearing completely 
and also the sight of her left eye. Her right eye was 
‘so badly affected that she could see but little; and it, 
too, became entirely blind when she was eight. She lived
-P-A-G-E-73
  MENTAL DEVELOPMENT AND MOTOR TRAINING 55 
in this condition until she was sixty years old, when 
she died. Professor Donaldson submitted the cortex 
of her brain to a most careful examination, also com- 
paring the corresponding areas on the two hemispheres 
with each other. He found that as a whole the cortex 
was ‘thinner than in the case of normal individuals. 
He found also that the cortical area connected with the 
left eye—namely, the right occipital region—was: much 
thinner than that for the right eye, which had retained 
its:sight longer than the other. He says: ‘‘It is inter- 
esting to notice that those parts of the cortex which, 
according to the current view, were associated with the 
,(lefective sense organs were also particularly thin. The 
“catise of this thinness was found to be due, at least in 
part, to the small size of the nerve cells there present. 
Not only were the large and medium-sized cells smaller, 
-but the impression made on the observer was that they 
were also less numerous than in the normal cortex.’’ 
Effect of Sensory Stimulii—No doubt if we could ex- 
amine the brain of a person who has grown up in an 
environment rich in stimuli to the eye, where nature, 
earth, and sky have presented a changing panorama of 
color and form to attract the eye; where all the sounds 
of nature, from the chirp of the insect to the roar of 
the waves and the murmur of the breeze, and from the 
* softest tones of the voice to the mightiest sweep of the 
great orchestra, have challenged the ear; where many 
and varied odors and perfumes have assailed the nos- 
trils; where a great range of tastes have tempted the 
palate; where many varieties of touch and temperature 
sensations have been experienced—no doubt if we could 
examine such a brain we should find the sensory areas 
of the cortex excelling in thickness because its cells were 
well developed and full sized from the currents which
-P-A-G-E-74
    56 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
had been pouring into them from the outside world. 
On the other hand, if we could examine a cortex which 
had lacked any one of these stimuli, we should find some 
area in it undeveloped because of this deficiency. Its 
owner therefore possesses but the fraction of a brain, 
and would in a corresponding degree find his mind - 
incomplete. 
Necessity for Motor Activity Likewise in the case of 
the motor areas. Pity the boy or girl who has been 
deprived of the opportunity to use every muscle to the 
fullest extent in the unrestricted plays and games of 
childhood. For where such activities are not wide in 
their scope, there some areas of the cortex will remain 
undeveloped, because unused, and the person will be 
handicapped later in his life from lack of skill in the 
activities depending on these centers. Halleck says 
in this connection: ‘‘If we could examine the developing 
motor region with a microscope of sufficient magnifying 
power, it is conceivable that we might learn wherein 
the modification due to exercise consists. We might 
also, under such conditions, be able to say, ‘This is the 
motor region of a piano player; the modifications here 
correspond precisely to those necessary for controlling 
such movements of the hand.’ Or, ‘This is the motor 
tract of a blacksmith; this, of an engraver; and these 
must be the cells which govern the vocal organs of an 
orator.’’’ Whether or not the microscope will ever 
reveal such things to us, there is no doubt that the 
conditions suggested exist, and that back of every in- 
efficient and awkward attempt at physical control lies a 
motor area with its cells undeveloped by use. No wonder 
that our processes of learning physical adjustment and 
control are slow, for they are a growth in the brain 
rather than a simple ‘‘learning how.’’
-P-A-G-E-75
>< 
  MENTAL DEVELOPMENT AND MOTOR TRAINING 57 
The training of the nervous system consists finally, 
then, in the development and codrdination of the neu- 
rones of which it is composed. We have seen that the 
sensory cells are to be developed by the sensory stimuli 
pouring in upon them, and the motor cells by the motor 
impulses which they send out to the muscles. The sen- 
sory and the motor fibers likewise, being an outgrowth of 
their respective cells, find their development in carrying 
the impulses which result in sensation and movement. 
Thus it is seen that the neurone is, in its development as 
in its work, a unit. 
Development of the Association Centers.—To this sim- 
\pler type of sensory and motor development which we 
have been considering, we must add that which comes 
from the more complex mental processes, such as mem- 
ory, thought, and imagination. For it is in connection 
with these that the association fibers are developed, 
and the brain areas so connected that they can work 
together as a unit. A simple illustration will enable us 
to see more clearly how the nervous mechanism acts to 
bring this about. 
Suppose that I am walking along a country road 
deeply engaged in meditation, and that I come to a 
puddle of water in my pathway. I may turn aside and 
avoid the obstruction without my attention being called 
to it, and without interruption of my train of thought. 
The act has been automatic. In this case the nerve cur- 
rent has passed from the eye (S) over an afferent fiber 
to a sensory center (s) in the nervous s¥stem below 
the cortex; from there it has been forwarded to a motor 
center (m) in the same region, and on out over a motor 
fiber to the proper muscles (M), which are to execute 
the required act. The act having been completed, the 
sensory nerves connected with the muscles employed
-P-A-G-E-76
  58 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
report the fact back that the work is done, thus com- 
pleting the circuit. This event may be taken as an 
illustration of literally thousands of acts which we per- 
form daily without the intervention of consciousness, 
and hence without involving the hemispheres. 
If, however, instead of avoiding the puddle uncon- 
  So oM Fie. 16.—Diagram illustrating the paths of association. 
sciously, I do so from consideration of the danger of 
wet feet and the disagreeableness of soiled shoes and 
the ridiculous appearance I shall make, then the current 
cannot take the short circuit, but must pass on up to 
the cortex. Here it awakens consciousness to take notice 
of the obstruction, and calls forth the images which 
aid in directing the necessary movements. This simple 
illustration may be greatly complicated, substituting 
for it one of the more complex problems which are 
continually presenting themselves to us for solution, or 
the associated trains of thought that are constantly 
occupying our minds. But the truth of the illustration
-P-A-G-E-77
  MENTAL DEVELOPMENT AND MOTOR TRAINING 59 
still holds. Whether in the simple or the complex act, 
there is always a forward passing of the nerve current 
through the sensory and thought centers, and on out 
through the motor centers to the organs which are to 
be concerned in the motor response. 
The Factors Involved in a Simple Action.—Thus it will 
be seen that in the simplest act which can be considered 
there are the following factors: (1) The stimulus which 
acts on the end-organ; (2) the ingoing current over an 
afferent nerve; (3) the sensory or interpreting cells; 
(4) the fibers connecting the sensory with a motor cen- 
ter; (5) the motor cells; (6) the efferent nerve to carry 
the direction for the movement outward to the muscle; 
(7) the motor response; and, finally, (8) the report 
back that the act has been performed. With this in 
mind it fairly bewilders one to think of the marvelous 
complexity of the work that is going on in our nervous 
mechanism every moment of our life, even without con- 
sidering the higher thought processes at all. How, with 
these added, the resulting complexity all works out into 
beautiful harmony is indeed beyond comprehension. 
3. EDUCATION AND THE TRAINING OF THE 
NERVOUS SYSTEM 
Fortunately, many of the best opportunities for sen- 
sory and motor training do not depend on schools or 
courses of study. The world is full of stimuli to our 
senses and to our social natures; and our common lives 
are made up of the responses we make to these stimuli, 
—the movements, acts and deeds by which we fit our- 
selves into our world of environment. Undoubtedly 
the most rapid and vital progress we make in our devel- 
opment is accomplished in the years before we have
-P-A-G-E-78
  60 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
reached the age to go to school. Yet it is the business: 
of education to see that we do not lack any essential 
opportunity, to make sure that necessary lines of stimuli 
or of motor training have not been omitted from our 
development. 
Education to Supply Opportunities for Stimulus and Re- 
sponse.—The great problem of education is, on the phys- 
ical side, it would seem, then, to provide for ourselves 
and those we seek to educate as rich an environment of 
sensory and social stimuli as possible; one whose im- 
pressions will be full of suggestions to response in motor | 
activity and the higher thought processes; and then to 
give opportunity for thought and for expression in 
acts and deeds in the largest possible number of lines. 
And added to this must be frequent and clear sensory 
and motor recall, a living over again of the sights and 
sounds and odors and the motor activities we have once 
experienced. There must also be the opportunity for 
the forming of worthy plans and ideals. For in this 
way the brain centers which were concerned in the 
original sensation or thought or movement are again 
brought into exercise, and their development continued. 
Through recall and imagination we are able not only 
greatly to multiply the effects of the immediate sensory 
and motor stimuli which come to us, but also to improve 
our power of thinking by getting a fund of material 
upon which the mind can draw. : 
Order of Development in the Nervous System.—Nature 
has set the order in which the powers of the nervous 
system shall develop. And we must follow this order 
if we would obtain the best results. Stated in technical 
terms, the order is from fundamental to accessory. This 
is to say that the nerve centers controlling the larger 
and more general movements of the body ripen first,  
-P-A-G-E-79
  MENTAL DEVELOPMENT AND MOTOR TRAINING 61 
and those governing the finer motor adjustments later. 
For example, the larger body muscles of the child which 
are concerned with sitting up come under control earlier 
than those connected with walking. The arm muscles 
develop control earlier than the finger muscles, and 
the head and neck muscles earlier than the eye muscles. 
So also the more general and less highly specialized 
powers of the mind ripen sooner than the more highly 
specialized. Perception and observation precede powers 
of critical judgment and association. Memory and 
imagination ripen earlier than reasoning and the logical 
ability. 
This all means that our educational system must be 
planned to follow the order of nature. Children of 
the primary grades should not be required to write with 
fine pencils or pens which demand delicate finger adjust- 
ments, since the brain centers for these finer codrdina- 
tions are not yet developed. Young children should not 
be set at work necessitating difficult eye control, such 
as stitching through perforated card-board, reading fine 
print and the like, as their eyes are not yet ready for 
such tasks. The more difficult analytical problems of 
arithmetic and relations of grammar should not be re- 
quired of pupils at a time when the association areas 
of the brain are not yet ready for this type of thinking. 
For such methods violate the law of nature, and the child 
is sure to suffer the penalty. 
4, IMPORTANCE OF HEALTH AND VIGOR OF THE 
NERVOUS SYSTEM 
Parallel with opportunities for proper stimuli and 
response the nervous system must possess good tonicity, 
or vigor. This depends in large degree on general health
-P-A-G-E-80
62 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
and nutrition, with freedom from overfatigue. No 
favorableness of environment nor excellence of training 
can result in an efficient brain if the nerve energy has 
run low from depleted health, want of proper nourish- 
ment, or exhaustion. 
The Influence of Fatigue—Histologists find thatthe 
nuclei of nerve cells are shrunk as much as fifty per 
cent by extreme fatigue. Reasonable fatigue followed 
by proper recuperation is not harmful, but even neces- 
sary if the best development is to be attained; but. 
fatigue without proper nourishment and rest is fatal 
to all mental operations, and indeed finally to the nervous 
system itself, leaving it permanently in a condition of 
low tone, and incapable of rallying to strong effort. For 
rapid and complete recuperation the cells must have 
not only the best of nourishment but opportunity for 
rest as well. 
Extreme and long-continued fatigue is hostile to the 
development and welfare of any nervous system, and 
especially to that of children. Not only does over- 
fatigue hinder growth, but it also results in the forma- 
tion of certain toxins, or poisons, in the organism, which 
are particularly harmful to nervous tissue. It is these 
fatigue toxins that account for many of the nervous and 
mental disorders which accompany breakdowns from 
overwork. On the whole, the evil effects from mental 
overstrain are more to be feared than from physical 
overstrain. 
The Effects of Worry.—There is, perhaps, no greater 
foe to brain growth and efficiency than the nervous and 
worn-out condition which comes from loss of sleep or 
from worry. Experiments in the psychological labora- 
tories have showh that nerve cells shrivel up and lose 
their vitality under loss of sleep. Let this go on for
-P-A-G-E-81
  MENTAL DEVELOPMENT AND MOTOR TRAINING 63 
any considerable length of time, and the loss is irrep- 
arable; for the cells can nover recuperate. This is 
especially true in the case of children or young people. 
Many school boys and girls, indeed many college students, 
are making slow progress in their.studies not because 
they are mentally slow or ifefficien® not even chiefly 
because they lose time that should be put on their 
lessons, but because they are incapacitating their brains 
for good service through late hours and the consequent 
loss of sleep. Add to this condition that of worry, which 
often accompanies it from the fact of failure in lessons, 
and a naturally good and well-organized nervous system 
is sure to fail. Worry, from whatever cause, should be 
avoided as one would avoid poison, if we would bring 
ourselves to the highest degree of efficiency. Not only 
does worry temporarily unfit the mind for its best 
work, but its evil results are permanent, since the 
mind is left with a poorly developed or undone nervous 
system through which to work, even after the cause 
for worry has been removed and the worry itself has 
ceased. ” 
Not only should each individual seek to control the 
causes of worry in his own life, but the home and the 
school should force upon childhood as few causes for 
worry as may be. Children’s worry over fears of the 
dark, over sickness and death, over prospective but de- 
layed punishment, over the thousand and one real or 
imaginary troubles of childhood, should be eliminated 
so far as possible. School examinations that prey on 
the peace of mind, threats of failure of promotion, all 
nagging and sarcasm, and whatever else may cause 
continued pain or worry to sensitive minds should be 
barred from our schoolroom methods and practice. The 
price we force the child to pay for results through their
-P-A-G-E-82
  64 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
use is too great for them to be tolerated. We must 
seek a better way. 
The Factors in Good Nutrition—For the best nutrition 
there is necessity first of all plenty of nourishing and 
healthful food. Science and experience have both dis- 
proved the supposition that students should be scantily 
fed. O’Shea claims that many brain workers are far | 
short of their highest grade of efficiency because of 
starving their brains from poor diet. And not only 
must the food be of the right quality, but the body must 
be in good health. Little good to eat the best of food 
unless it is being properly digested and assimilated. And 
little good if all the rest is as it should be, and the right 
amount of oxidation does not go on in the brain so as 
to remove the wornout cells and make place for new 
ones. This warns us that pure air and a strong circula- 
tion are indispensable to the best working of our brains. 
No doubt many students who find their work too hard 
for them might locate the trouble in their stomachs or 
their lungs or the food they eat, rather than in their 
minds. 
5. PROBLEMS FOR INTROSPECTION AND OBSERVATION 
1. Estimate the mental progress made by the child during 
the first five years and compare with that made during the 
second five years of its life. To do this make a list, so far 
as you are able, of the acquisitions of each period. What do 
you conclude as to the importance of play and freedom in 
early education? Why not cortinue this method instead of 
sending the child to school? 
2. Which has the better opportunity for sensory training, 
the city child or the country child? For social training? For 
motor development through play? It is said by specialists that 
 
-P-A-G-E-83
  
MENTAL DEVELOPMENT AND MOTOR TRAINING 65 
country children are not as good players as city children. 
Why should this be the case? 
3. Observe carefully some group of children for evidences 
of lack of sensory training (Interest in sensory objects, skill 
in observation, ete.). For lack of motor training (Failure in 
motor control, awkwardness, lack of skill in play, ete.). Do 
you find that general mental ability seems to be correlated 
with sensory and motor ability, or not? 
4. What sensory training can be had from (1) geography, 
(2) agriculture, (3) arithmetic, (4) drawing? What lines of 
motor training ought the school to afford, (1) in general, (2) 
for the hand, (3) in the grace and poise of carriage or bear- 
ing, (4) in any other line? Make observation tests of these 
points in one or more school rooms and report the results. 
5. Describe what you think must be the type of mental 
life of Helen Keller. (Read “The World I Live In,” by Helen 
Keller.) 
6. Study groups of children for signs of deficiency in 
brain power from lack of nutrition. From fatigue. From 
worry. From lack of sleep.

CHAPTER V 
HABIT 
  Hasrr is our ‘‘best friend or worst enemy.’’ We are 
‘‘walking bundles of habits.’’ Habit is the ‘‘fly-wheel 
of society,’’ keeping men patient and docile in the hard 
or disagreeable lot which some must fill. Habit is a 
““cable which we cannot break.’’ So say the wise men. 
Let me know your habits of life and you have revealed 
your moral standards and conduct. Let me discover 
your intellectual habits, and I understand your type of 
mind and methods of thought. In short, our lives are 
largely a daily round of activities dictated by our habits 
in this line or that. Most of our movements and acts 
are habitual; we think as we have formed the habit of 
thinking; we decide as we are in the habit of deciding; 
we sleep, or eat, or speak as we have grown into the habit 
of doing these things; we may even say our prayers or 
perform other religious exercises as matters of habit. 
But while habit is the veriest tyrant, yet its good offices 
far exceed the bad even in the most fruitless or de- 
praved life. 
1 THE NATURE OF HABIT 
Many people when they speak or think of habit give 
the term a very narrow or limited meaning. They have 
in mind only certain moral or personal tendencies usu- 
ally spoken of as one’s ‘‘habits.’’? But in order to under- 
stand habit in any thorough and complete way we must, 
66
-P-A-G-E-85
  HABIT 67 
as suggested by the preceding paragraph, broaden our 
concept to include every possible line of physical and 
mental activity. Habit may be defined as the tendency 
of the nervous system to repeat any act that has been 
performed once or many times. 
The Physical Basis of Habit—H abit is to be explained 
from the standpoint of its physical basis. Habits are 
formed because the tissues of our brains are capable of 
being modified by use, and of so retaining the effects 
of this modification that the same act is easier of per- 
formance each succeeding time. This results in the old 
act being repeated instead of a new one being selected, 
and hence the old act is perpetuated. 
Even dead and inert matter obeys the same principles 
in this regard as does living matter. Says M. Leon 
Dumont: ‘‘Everyone knows how a garment, having 
been worn a certain time, clings to the shape of the 
body better than when it was new;.there has been a 
change in the tissue, and this change is a new habit of 
cohesion; a lock works better after having been used 
some time; at the outset more force was required to 
overcome certain roughness in the mechanism. The 
overcoming of this resistance is a phenomenon of habit- 
uation. It costs less trouble to fold a paper when it 
has been folded already. This saving of trouble is due 
to the essential nature of habit, which brings it about 
that, to reproduce the effect, a less amount of the out- 
ward cause is required. The sounds of a violin improve 
by use in the hands of an able artist, because the fibers 
of the wood at last contract habits of vibration con- 
formed to harmonic relations. This is what gives such 
inestimable value to instruments that have belonged 
to great masters. Water, in flowing, hollows out for 
itself a channel, which grows broader and deeper; and,
-P-A-G-E-86
  68 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
after having ceased to flow, it resumes when it flows 
again the path traced for itself before. Just so, the 
impressions of outer objects fashion for themselves in 
the nervous system more and more appropriate paths, 
and these vital phenomena recur under similar excite- 
ments from without, when they have been interrupted 
for a certain time.’’* 
All Living Tissue Plastic What is true of inanimate 
matter is doubly true of living tissue. The tissues of 
the human body can be molded into almost any form 
you choose if taken in time. <A child may be placed on ~ 
his feet at too early an age, and the bones of his legs 
form the habit of remaining bent. The Flathead Indian 
binds a board on the skull of his child, and its head 
forms the habit of remaining flat on the top. Wrong 
bodily postures produce curvature of the spine, and 
pernicious modes of dress deform the bones of the chest. 
The muscles may be trained into the habit of keeping 
the shoulders straight or letting them droop; those of . 
the back, to keep the body well up on the hips, or to 
let it sag; those of locomotion, to give us a light, springy 
step, or to allow a shuffling carriage; those of speech, to 
give us a clear-cut, accurate articulation, or a careless, 
halting one; and those of the face, to give us a cheerful 
cast of countenance, or a glum and morose expression. 
Habit a Modification of Brain Tissue-—But the nervous 
tissue is the most sensitive and easily molded of all bod- 
ily tissues. In fact, it is probable that the real habit 
of our characteristic walk, gesture, or speech resides 
in the brain, rather than in the muscles which it con- 
trols. So delicate is the organization of the brain struc- 
ture and so unstable its molecules, that even the perfume 
of the flower, which assails the nose of a child, the song 
1Quoted by James, ‘‘Psychology,’’ Briefer Course, p. 135.
-P-A-G-E-87
  HABIT * 69 
of a bird, which strikes his ear, or the fleeting dream, 
which lingers but for a second in his sleep, has so modi- 
fied his brain that it will never again be as if these 
things had not been experienced. Every sensory cur- 
rent which runs in from the outside world; every motor 
eurrent which runs out to command a muscle; every 
thought that we think, has so modified the nerve struc- 
ture through which it acts, that a tendency remains for 
a like act to be repeated. Our brain and nervous system 
is daily being molded into fixed habits of acting by our 
thoughts and deeds, and thus becomes the automatic 
register of all we do. 
The old Chinese fairy story hits upon a fundamental 
and vital truth. These celestials tell their children that 
each child is accompanied by day and by night, every mo- 
ment of his life, by an invisible fairy, who is provided 
with a pencil and tablet. It is the duty of this fairy 
to put down every deed of the child, both good and evil, 
in an indelible record which will one day rise as a wit- 
ness against him. So it is in very truth with our brains. 
The wrong act may have been performed in secret, no 
living being may ever know that we performed it, and 
a-merciful Providence may forgive it; but the inexorable 
monitor of our deeds was all the time beside us writing 
the record, and the history of that act is inseribed for- 
ever in the tissues of our brain. It may be repented 
of bitterly in sackcloth and ashes and be discontinued, 
but its effects can never be quite effaced; they will re- 
main with us a handicap till our dying day, and in some 
critical moment in a great emergency we shall be in dan- 
ger of defeat from that long past and forgotten act. 
We Must Form Habits—We must, then, form habits. 
It is not at all in our power to say whether we will form 
habits or not; for, once started, they go on forming
-P-A-G-E-88
  70 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
themselves by day and night, steadily and relentlessly. 
Habit is, therefore, one of the great factors to be reck- 
oned with in our lives, and the question becomes not, 
Shall we form habits? but What habits we shall form. 
And we have the determining of this question largely 
in our own power, for habits do not just happen, nor 
do they come to us ready made. We ourselves make 
them from day to day through the acts we perform, and 
in so far as we have control over our acts, in that far 
we can. determine our habits. 
2. THE PLACE OF HABIT IN THE ECONOMY OF OUR 
LIVES 
Habit is one of nature’s methods of economizing time 
and effort, while at the same time securing greater skill 
and efficiency. This is easily seen when it is remembered . 
that habit tends towards automatic action; that is, to- 
wards action governed by the lower nerve centers and 
taking care of itself, so to speak, without the inter- 
ference of consciousness. Everyone has observed how 
much easier in the performance and more skillful in its 
execution is the act, be it playing a piano, painting a pic- 
ture, or driving a nail, when the movements involved 
have ceased to be consciously directed and become au- 
tomatic. 
Habit Increases Skill and Efficiency.—Practically all 
increase in skill, whether physical or mental, depends 
on our ability to form habits. Habit holds fast to the 
skill already attained while practice or intelligence 
makes ready for the next step in advance. Could we 
not form habits we should improve but little in our way 
of doing things, no matter how many times we did them 
over. We should now be obliged to go through the same
-P-A-G-E-89
  
HABIT (a 
bungling process of dressing ourselves as when we first 
learned it as children. Our writing would proceed as 
awkwardly in the high school as the primary, our eating 
as adults would be as messy and wide of the mark as 
when we were infants, and we should miss in a thousand 
ways the motor skill that now seems so easy and natural. . 
All highly skilled occupations, and those demanding 
great manual dexterity, likewise depend on our habit- 
forming power for the accurate and automatic move- — 
ments required. 
So with mental skill. A great portion of the funda- 
mentals of our education must be made automatic—must 
become matters of habit. We set out, to learn the sym- 
bols of speech. We hear words and see them on the 
printed page; associated with these words are meanings, 
or ideas. Habit binds the word and the idea together, 
so that to think of the one is to call up the other—and 
language is learned. We must learn numbers, so we 
practice the ‘‘combinations,’’ and with 4X6, or 3X8 we 
associate 24. Habit secures this association in our minds, 
and lo! we soon know our ‘‘tables.’’ And so on through- 
out the whole range of our learning. We learn certain 
symbols, or facts, or processes, and habit takes hold 
and renders these automatic so that we can use them 
freely, easily, and with skill, leaving our thought free 
for matters that cannot be made automatic. One of our 
greatest dangers is that we shall not make sufficiently 
automatic, enough of the necessary foundation material 
of education. Failing in this, we shall at best be but 
blunderers intellectually, handicapped because we failed 
to make proper use of habit in our development. 
For, as we have seen in an earlier chapter, there is a 
limit to our mental energy and also to the number of 
objects to which we are able to attend. It is only when
-P-A-G-E-90
  72 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
attention has been freed from the many things that can 
always be thought or done in the same way, that the 
mind can devote itself to the real problems that require 
judgment, imagination or reasoning. The writer whose 
spelling and punctuation do not take care of themselves 
will hardly make a success of writing. The mathema- 
tician whose number combinations, processes and for- 
mule are not automatic in his mind can never hope 
to make progress in mathematical thinking. The speaker 
who, while speaking, has to think of his gestures, his 
voice or his enunciation will never sway audiences by 
his logie or his eloquence. 
Habit Saves Effort and Fatigue-—We do most easily 
and with least fatigue that which we are accustomed 
to do. It is the new act or the strange task that tires 
us. The horse that is used to the farm wearies if put 
on the road, while the roadster tires easily when hitched 
to the plow. The experienced penman works all day at 
his desk without undue fatigue, while the man more 
accustomed to the pick and the shovel than to the pen, 
is exhausted by a half hour’s writing at a letter. Those 
who follow a sedentary and inactive occupation do not 
tire by much sitting, while children or others used to 
freedom and action may find it a wearisome task merely 
to remain still for an hour or two. 
Not only would the skill and speed demanded by mod- 
ern industry be impossible without the aid of habit, 
but without its help none could stand the fatigue and 
strain. The new workman placed at a high-speed ma- 
chine is ready to fall from weariness at the end of his 
first day. But little by little he learns to omit the un- 
necessary movements, the necessary movements become 
easier and more automatic through habit, and he finds 
the work easier. We may conclude, then, that not only
-P-A-G-E-91
  HABIT 73 
do consciously directed movements show less skill than 
the same movements made automatic by habit, but they 
also require more effort and produce greater fatigue. 
Habit Economizes Moral Effort.—To have to decide 
each time the question comes up whether we will attend 
to this lecture or sermon or lesson; whether we will per- 
severe and go through this piece of disagreeable work 
which we have begun; whether we will go to the trouble 
of being courteous and kind to this or that poor or un- 
lovely or dirty fellow-mortal; whether we will take this 
road because it looks easy, or that one because we know 
it to be the one we ought to take; whether we will be 
strictly fair and honest when we might just as well be 
the opposite ; whether we will resist the temptation which 
dares us; whether we will do this duty, hard though 
it is, which confronts us—to have to decide each of 
these questions every time it presents itself is to put 
too large a proportion of our thought and energy on 
things which should take care of themselves. For all 
these things should early become so nearly habitual that 
they can be settled with the very minimum of expendi- 
ture of energy when they arise. 
The Habit of Attention.—It is a noble thing to be able 
to attend by sheer force of will when the interest lags, 
or some more attractive thing appears, but ‘far better 
is it so to have formed the habit of attention that we nat- 
urally fall into that attitude when this is the desirable 
thing. To understand what I mean, you only have to 
- look over a class or an audience and note the different 
ways which people have of finally settling down to listen- 
ing. Some with an attitude which says, ‘‘Now here I am, 
ready to listen to you if you will interest me, otherwise 
not.’’ Others with a manner which says, ‘‘I did not 
teally come here expecting to listen, and you will have
-P-A-G-E-92
  74 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
a large task if you interest me; I uever listen unless I 
am compelled to, and the responsibility rests on you.”’ 
Others plainly say, ‘‘I really mean to listen, but I have 
hard work to control my thouglits, and if I wander I 
shall not blame you altogether ; it is just my way.’’ And 
still others say, ‘‘ When I am expected to listen, I always 
listen whether there is anything much to listen to or 
not. I have formed that habit, and so have no quarrel 
  with myself about it. You can depend on me to be’ 
attentive, for I cannot afford to weaken my habit of at- 
tention whether you do well or not.’’ Every speaker 
will clasp these last listeners to his heart and feed them 
on the choicest thoughts of his soul; they are the ones to 
whom he speaks and to whom his address will appeal. 
Habit Enables Us to Meet the Disagreeable.—To be 
able to persevere in the face of difficulties and hard- 
ships and carry through the disagreeable thing in spite 
of the protests of our natures against the sacrifice which 
it requires, is a creditable thing; but it is more credit- 
able to have so formed the habit of perseverance that 
the disagreeable duty shall be done without a struggle, 
or protest, or question. Horace Mann testifies of him- 
self that’ whatever success he was able to attain was 
made possible through the early, habit which he 
formed of never stopping to inquire whether he liked 
to do a thing which needed doing, but of doing every- 
thing equally well and without question, both the pleas- 
ant and the unpleasant. 
The youth who can fight out a moral battle and win 
against the allurements of some ‘attractive temptation 
is worthy the highést honor and praise; but so long as 
he has to fight the same battle over and over again, he is 
on dangerous ground morally. For good morals must 
finally become habits, so ingrained in us that, the oy)
-P-A-G-E-93
  HABIT 75 
decision comes largely without effort and without strug- 
gle. Otherwise the strain is too great, and defeat will 
-oecasionally come; and defeat means weakness and at 
last disaster, after the spirit has tired of the constant 
conflict. And so on in a hundred lines. Good habits 
are more to be coveted than individual victories in spe- 
cial cases, much as these are to be desired. For good 
habits mean victories all along the line. 
Habit the Foundation of Personality——The biologist 
tells us that it is the constant and not the occasional 
in the environment that impresses itself on an organism. 
So also it is the habitual in our lives that builds itself 
into our character and personality. In a very real sense 
we are what we are in the habit of doing and thinking. 
Without habit, personality could not exist; for we 
could never’ do a thing twice alike, and hence would 
be a new person each succeeding moment. The acts 
which give us our own peculiar individuality are our 
habitual acts—the little things that do themselves mo- 
ment by moment without care or attention, and are the 
* truest and best expression of our real selves., Probably 
no one of us could be very sure which arm he puts into 
the sleeve, or which foot he puts into the shoe, first; and 
yet each of us certainly formed the habit long’ ago 
‘of doing these things in a certain way. We might not. 
be able to describe just how we hold knife and fork 
and spoon, and yet each has his own characteristic and 
habitual way of handling them. We sit down and get 
up in some characteristic way, and the very poise of our 
heads and attitudes of our bodies are the result of habit. 
We get sleepy and wake up, become hungry and thirsty 
_at certain hours, through force of habit. We form 
the habit of liking a certain chair, or nook, or corner, 
or path, or desk, and then seek this to the exclusion 
~ + ~ 
ee 
i
-P-A-G-E-94
  76 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
of all others. We habitually use a particular pitch of 
voice and type of enunciation in speaking, and this be- 
comes one of our characteristic marks; or we form the 
habit of using barbarisms or solecisms of language in 
youth, and these cling to us and become an inseparable 
part of us later in life. 
On the mental side the case is no different. Our 
thinking is as characteristic as our physical acts. We 
may form the habit of thinking things out logically, or 
of jumping to conclusions; of thinking critically and in- 
dependently, or of taking things unquestioningly on the 
authority of others. We may form the habit of care- 
fully reading. good, sensible books, or of skimming sen- 
timental and trashy ones; of choosing elevating, en- 
nobling companions, or the opposite; of being a good 
conversationalist and doing our part in a social group, 
or of being a drag on the conversation, and needing to 
be ‘‘entertained.’? We may form the habit of obsery- 
ing the things about us and enjoying the beauti- 
ful in our environment, or of failing to observe or 
to enjoy. We may form the habit of obeying the 
voice of conscience or of weakly yielding to tempta- 
tion without a struggle; of taking a reverent attitude 
of prayer in our devotions, or of merely saying our 
prayers. 
Habit Saves Worry and Rebellion—Habit has been 
called the ‘‘balance wheel’’ of society. This is because 
men readily become habituated to the hard, the dis- 
agreeable, or the inevitable, and cease to battle against 
it. <A lot that at first seems unendurable after a time 
causes less revolt. A sorrow that seems too poignant 
to be borne in the course of time loses some of its sharp- 
ness. Oppression or injustice that arouses the fiercest 
resentment and hate may finally come to be accepted 
 
-P-A-G-E-95
HABIT 7 
with resignation. Habit helps us learn that ‘‘what can- 
not be cured must be endured.’’ 
3. THE TYRANNY OF HABIT 
  Even Good Habits Need to Be Modified—But even in 
good habits there is danger. Habit is the opposite of 
attention. Habit relieves attention of unnecessary 
strain. Every habitual act was at one time, either in 
the history of the race or of the individual, a voluntary 
act; that is, it was performed under active attention. 
As the habit grew, attention was gradually rendered 
unnecessary, until finally it dropped entirely out. And 
herein lies the danger. Habit once formed has no way 
of being modified unless in some way attention is called 
to it, for a habit left to itself becomes more and more 
firmly fixed. The rut grows deeper. In very few, if 
any, of our actions can we afford to have this the case. 
Our habits need to be progressive, they need to grow, 
to be modified, to be improved. Otherwise they will 
become an incrusting shell, fixed and: unyielding, which 
will limit our growth. 
It is necessary, then, to keep our habitual acts andey 
some surveillance of attention, to pass them in review 
for inspection every now and then, that we may discover 
possible modifications which will make them more serv- 
iceable. We need to be inventive, constantly to find out 
better ways of doing things. Habit takes care of our 
standing, walking, sitting; but how many of us could 
not improve his poise and carriage if he would? Our 
speech has become largely automatic, but no doubt all of 
us might remove faults of enunciation, pronunciation or 
stress from our speakiig. So also we might better our  
-P-A-G-E-96
| | 
78 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
  habits of study and thinking, our methods of memoriz- 
ing, or our manner of attending. 
The Tendency of “Ruts.”—But this will require some- 
thing of heroism. For to follow the well-beaten path 
of custom is easy and pleasant, while to break out of the 
rut of habit and start a new line of action is difficult 
and disturbing. Most people prefer to keep doing things 
as they always have done them, to continue reading and 
thinking and believing as they have long been in the 
habit of doing, not so much because they feel that their 
way is best, but because it is easier than to change. 
Hence the great mass of us settle down on the plane of 
mediocrity, and become ‘‘old fogy.’’ We learn to do 
things passably well, cease to think about improving our 
ways of doing them, and so fall into a rut. Only the 
few go on. They make use of habit as the rest do, but 
they also continue to attend at critical points of action, 
and so make habit an ally in place of accepting it as a- 
tyrant. 
4, HABIT-FORMING A PART OF EDUCATION 
It follows from the importance of habit in our lives 
that no small part of education should be concerned 
with the development of serviceable habits. Says James, 
“‘Could the young but realize how soon they will become 
mere walking bundles of habits, they would give more 
heed to their conduct while in the plastic state. We are 
spinning our own fates, good or evil, and never to be 
undone. Every smallest stroke of virtue or of vice leaves 
its never-so-little scar.’? Any youth who is forming a~ 
large number of useful habits is receiving no mean edu- 
cation, no matter if his knowledge of books may be lim: 
ited; on the other hand, no one ‘who is forming a large
-P-A-G-E-97
HABIT 79 
  number of bad habits is being well educated, no matter 
how brilliant his knowledge may be. 
Youth the Time for Habit-forming.—Childhood and 
youth is the great time for habit-forming. Then the 
brain is plastic and easily molded, and it retains its 
impressions more indelibly; later it is hard to modify, 
and the impressions made are less permanent. It is 
hard to teach an old dog new tricks; nor would he re- 
member them if you could teach them to him, nor be able 
to perform them well even if he could remember them. 
The young child will, within the first few weeks of its 
life, form habits of sleeping and feeding. It may in a 
few days be led into the habit of sleeping in the dark, or 
requiring a light; of going to sleep lying quietly, or of 
insisting upon being rocked; of getting hungry by the 
clock, or of wanting its food at all times when it finds 
nothing else to do, and so on. It is wholly outside the 
power of the mother or the nurse to determine whether 
the child shall form habits, but largely within their 
» power to say what habits shall be formed, since they 
control his acts. 
As the child grows older, the range of his habits in- 
ereases ; and by the time he has reached his middle teens, 
the greater number of his personal habits are formed. 
It is very doubtful whether a boy who has not formed 
habits of punctuality before the age of fifteen will ever 
be entirely trustworthy in matters requiring precision 
‘in this line. The girl who has not, before this age, 
formed habits of neatness and order will hardly make a 
tidy housekeeper later in her life. Those who in youth 
have no opportunity to habituate themselvés to the 
usages of society may study books on etiquette and em- 
ploy private instructors in the art of polite behavior all 
they please later in life, but they will never cease to ig -
-P-A-G-E-98
80 THE MIND AND ITs EDUCATION 
  be awkward and ill at ease. None are at a greater dis- 
advantage than the suddenly-grown-rich who attempt 
late in life to surround themselves with articles of art 
and luxury, though their habits were all formed amid 
barrenness and want during their earlier years. 
The Habit of Achievement.—What youth does not 
dream of being great, or noble, or a celebrated scholar! 
And how few there are who finally achieve their ideals! 
‘Where does the cause of failure lie? Surely not in the 
lack of high ideals. Multitudes of young people have 
“‘Excelsior!’’ as their motto, and yet never get started 
up the mountain slope, let alone toiling on to its top. 
They have put in hours dreaming of the glory farther 
up, and have never begun to climb. The difficulty comes 
in not realizing that the only way to become what we 
wish or dream that we may become is to form the habit 
of being that thing. To form the habit of achievement, 
of effort, of self-sacrifice, if need be. To form the habit 
of deeds along with dreams; to form the habit of doing. 
‘Who of us has not at this moment lying in wait for 
his convenience in the dim future a number of things 
which he means to do just as soon as this term of school 
is finished, or this job of work is completed, or when 
he is not so busy as now? And how seldom does he ever 
get at these things at all! Darwin tells that in his youth 
he loved poetry, art, and music, but was so busy with 
his scientific work that he could ill spare the time to 
indulge these tastes. So he promised himself that he 
would devote his time to scientific work and make his 
mark in this. Then he would have time for the things 
that he loved, and would cultivate his taste for the fine 
arts. He made his mark in the field of science, and then 
turned again to poetry, to music, to art. But alas! they 
were all dead and dry bones to him, without life or in-

terest. He had passed the time when he could ever form 
the taste for them. He had formed his habits in another 
direction, and now it was forever too late to form new 
habits. His own conclusion is, that if he had his 
life to live over again, he would each week listen to some 
musical concert and visit some art gallery, and that 
each day he would read some poetry, and thereby keep 
alive and active the love for them. 
So every school and home should be a species of habit- 
factory—a place where children develop habits of neat- 
ness, punctuality, obedience, politeness, dependability 
and the other graces of character. 
5. RULES FOR HABIT-FORMING 
James’s Three Maxims for Habit-forming.—On the 
forming of new habifs and the leaving off of old ones, 
I know of no better statement than that of James, based 
on Bain’s chapter on ‘‘Moral Habits.’? I quote this 
statement at some length: ‘‘In the acquisition of a 
new habit, or the leaving off of an old one, we must 
take care to launch ourselves with as strong and de- 
cided an initiative as possible. Accumulate all the pos- 
sible cireumstances which shall reénforce right motives; 
put yourself assiduously in conditions that encourage 
the new way; make engagements incompatible with the 
old; take a public pledge, if the case allows; in short, 
develop your resolution with every aid you know. This 
will give your new beginning such a momentum that 
the temptation to break down will not occur as soon as 
it otherwise might; and every day during which a break- 
down is postponed adds to the chances of its not occur- 
ring at all. 
“The second maxim is: Never suffer an exception to
-P-A-G-E-100
  82 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
occur until the new habit is securely rooted in your life. — 
Each lapse is like letting fall a ball of string which one 
is carefully winding up; a single slip undoes more than 
a great many turns will wind again. Continuity of 
training is the great means of making the nervous sys- 
tem act infallibly right. . . . The need of securing suc- 
cess nerves one to future vigor. 
‘‘A third maxim may be added to the preceding pair: 
Seize the very first possible opportunity to act on every 
resolution you make, and on every emotional prompting 
yow may experience in the direction of the habits you 
aspire to gain. It is not in the moment of their forming, 
but in the moment of their producing motor effects, 
that resolves and aspirations communicate the new ‘set’ 
to the brain.’’? 
The Preponderance of Good Habits Over Bad.—And 
finally, let no one be disturbed or afraid because in a lit- 
tle time you become a ‘‘walking bundle of habits.’’ For 
in so far as your good actions predominate over your 
bad ones, that much will your good habits outweigh your 
bad habits. Silently, moment by moment, efficiency is . 
growing out of all worthy acts well done. Every bit 
of heroic self-sacrifice, every battle fought and won, 
every good deed performed, is being irradicably credited 
to you in your nervous system, and will finally add its 
mite toward achieving the success of your ambitions. 
6. PROBLEMS IN OBSERVATION AND INTROSPECTION 
1. Select some act which you have recently begun to per- 
form and watch it grow more and more habitual. Notice 
carefully for a week and see whether you do not discover

  some habits which you did not know you had. Make a catalog 
of your bad habits; of the most important of your good ones. 
2. Set out to form some new habits which you desire to 
possess; also to break some undesirable habit, watching care- 
fully what takes place in both cases, and how long it requires. 
3. Try the following experiment and relate the results to 
the matter of automatic control brought about by habit: Draw 
a star on a sheet of cardboard. Place this on a table before 
you, with a hand-mirror so arranged that you can see the star 
“in the mirror. Now trace the outline of the star with a pen- 
cil, looking steadily in the mirror to guide your hand. Do 
not lift the pencil from the paper from the time’ you start 
until you finish. Have others try this experiment. 
4. Study some group of pupils for their habits (1) of 
attention, (2) of speech, (3) of standing, sitting, and walking, 
(4) of study. Report on your observations and suggest meth- 
ods of curing bad habits observed. 
5. Make a list of “mannerisms” you have observed, and 
suggest how they may be cured. 
6. Make a list of from ten to twenty habits which you 
think the school and its work should especially cultivate. 
What ones of these are the schools you know least successfvi 
in cultivating? Where does the trouble lie?

CHAPTER VI 
SENSATION 
  WE can best understand the problems of sensation 
and perception if we first think of the existence of two 
great worlds—the world of physical nature without and 
the world of mind within. On the one hand is our ma- 
terial environment, the things we see and hear and touch 
and taste and handle; and on the other hand our con- 
sciousness, the means by which we come to know this 
outer world and adjust ourselves to it. These two worlds 
seem in a sense to belong to and require each other. 
For what would be the meaning or use of the physical 
world with no mind to know or use it; and what would 
be the use of a mind with nothing to be known or 
thought about? 
1. HOW WE COME TO KNOW THE EXTERNAL WORLD 
There is a marvel about our coming to know the ex- 
ternal world which we shall never be able fully to un- 
derstand. We have come by this knowledge so grad- 
ually and unconsciously that it now appears to us as 
commonplace, and we take for granted many things that 
it would puzzle us to explain. 
Knowledge through the Senses.—For example, we say, 
““Of course I see yonder green tree: it is about ten rods 
distant.’’ But why ‘‘of course’? Why should objects 
at a distance from us and with no evident connection 
84
-P-A-G-E-103
  SENSATION 85 
between us and them be known to us at all merely by 
turning our eyes in their direction when there is light? 
Why not rather say with the blind son of Professor 
Puiseaux of Paris, who, when asked if he would like to 
be restored to sight, answered: ‘‘If it were not for 
curiosity I would rather have long arms. It seems to 
me that my hands would teach me better what is passing 
in the moon than your eyes or telescopes.’’ 
We listen and then say, ‘‘Yes, that is a certain bell 
ringing in the neighboring village,’’ as if this were the 
most simple thing in the world. But why should one 
piece of metal striking against another a mile or two 
away make us aware that there is a bell there at all, let 
alone that it is a certain bell whose tone we recog- 
nize? Or we pass our fingers over a piece of cloth and 
decide, ‘‘That is silk.’’ But why, merely by placing our 
skin in contact with a bit of material, should we be able 
to know its quality, much less that it is cloth and that 
its threads were originally spun by an insect? Or we 
take a sip of liquid and say, ‘‘This milk is sour.’’ But 
why should we be able by taking the liquid into the 
mouth and bringing it into contact with the mucous 
membrane to tell that it is milk, and that it pos- 
sesses the quality which we call sour? Or, once more, 
we get a whiff of air through the open window in the 
springtime and say, ‘‘There is a lilac bush in bloom on 
the lawn.’’ Yet why, from inhaling air containing par- 
ticles of lilac, should we be able to know that there is 
anything outside, much less that it is a flower and of a 
particular variety which we call lilac? Or, finally, we 
hold a heated flatiron up near the cheek and say, ‘‘This 
is too hot! it will burn the cloth.’’ But why by holding 
this object a foot away from the face do we know that 
it is there, let alone knowing its temperature?
-P-A-G-E-104
  86 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
The Unity of Sensory Experience——Further, our senses 
come through experience to have the power of fusing, or 
combining their knowledge, so to speak, by which each 
expresses its knowledge in terms of the others. Thus we 
take a glance out of the window and say that the day 
looks. cold, although we well know that we cannot see 
cold. Or we say that the melon sounds green, or the 
bell sounds cracked, although a crack or greenness can- 
not be heard. Or we say that the box feels empty, al- 
through emptiness cannot be felt. We have come to as- ~ 
sociate cold, originally experienced with days which 
look like the one we now see, with this particular appear- 
ance, and so we say we see the cold; sounds like the one 
coming from the bell we have come to associate with 
eracked bells, and that coming from the melon with 
green melons, until we say unhesitatingly that the bell 
sounds cracked and. the melon sounds green. And so 
with the various senses. Each gleans from the world 
its own particular bit of knowledge, but all are finally 
in a partnership and what is each one’s knowledge be- 
longs to every other one in so far as the other can 
use it. 
The Sensory Processes to Be Explained—The explana- 
tion of the ultimate nature of knowledge, and how we 
reach it through contact with our material environment, 
we will leave to the philosophers. And battles enough 
they have over the question, and still others they will 
have before the matter is settled. The easier and more 
important problem for us is to describe the processes 
by which the mind comes to know its environment, and 
to see how it uses this knowledge in thinking. This 
much we shall be able to do, for it is often possible to 
describe a process and discover its laws even when we 
cannot fully explain its nature and origin. We know
-P-A-G-E-105
SENSATION 87 
the process of digestion and assimilation, and the laws 
which govern them, although we do not understand the 
ultimate nature and origin of life which makes these 
possible. 
The Qualities of Objects Exist in the Mind.—Yet even 
in the relatively simple description which we have pro- 
posed many puzzles confront us, and one of them ap- 
pears at the very outset. This is that the qualities which 
we usually ascribe to objects really exist in our own 
minds and not in the objects at all. Take, for instance, 
the common qualities of light and color. The physicist 
tells us that what we see as light is occasioned by an 
incredibly rapid beating of ether waves on the retina of 
the eye. All space is filled with this ether; and when it 
is light—that is, when some object like the sun or other 
light-giving body is present—the ether is set in motion 
by the vibrating molecules of the body which is the 
source of light, its waves strike the retina, a current is 
produced and carried to the brain, and we see light. 
This means, then, that space, the medium in which we 
see objects, is not filled with light (the sensation), 
but with very rapid waves of ether, and that the light 
which we see really occurs in our own minds as the 
mental response to the physical stimulus of ether 
waves. Likewise with color. Color is produced by 
ether waves of different lengths and degrees of rapid- 
ibys ft 
Thus ether waves at the rate of 450 billions a second 
give us the sensation of red; of 472 billions a second, 
orange; of 526 billions a second, yellow; of 589 billions 
a second, green; of 640 billions a second, blue; of 722 
billions a second, indigo; of 790 billions a second, violet. 
‘What exists outside of us, then, is these ether waves 
of different rates, and not the colors (as sensations)
-P-A-G-E-106
88 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
  themselves. The beautiful yellow and crimson of a stn- 
set, the variegated colors of a landscape, the delicate 
pink in the cheek of a child, the blush of a rose, the shim- 
mering green of the lake—these reside not in the objects 
themselves, but in the consciousness of the one who 
sees them. The objects possess but the quality of 
reflecting back to the eye ether waves of the par- 
ticular rate corresponding to the color which we ascribe 
to them. Thus ‘‘red’’ objects, and no others, re- 
fleet back ether waves of a rate of 450 billions a 
second: ‘‘white’’ objects reflect all rates; ‘‘black’’ ob- 
jects reflect none. 
The case is no different with regard to sound. When 
we speak of a sound coming from a bell, what we really 
mean is that the vibrations of the bell have set up waves 
in the air between it and our ear, which have produced 
corresponding vibrations in the ear; that a nerve cur- 
rent was thereby produced; and that a sound was heard. 
But the sound (i.e., sensation) is a mental thing, and 
exists only in our own consciousness. What passed be- 
tween the sounding object and ourselves was waves in 
the intervening air, ready to be translated through the 
machinery of nerves and brain into the beautiful tones 
and melodies and harmonies of the mind. And so with 
all other sensations. 
The Three Sets of Factors.—What exists outside of us 
therefore is a stimulus, some form of physical energy, 
of a kind suitable to excite to activity a certain end- 
organ of taste, or touch, or smell, or sight, or hearing; 
what exists within us is the nervous machinery capable 
of converting this stimulus into a nerve current which 
shall produce an activity in the cortex of the brain; what 
results is the mental object which we call a sensation 
of taste, smell, touch, sight, or hearing.
-P-A-G-E-107
  SENSATION 89 
2. THE NATURE OF SENSATION 
Sensation Gives Us Our World of Qualities——In actual 
experience sensations are never known apart from the 
objects to which they belong. This is to say that when 
we see yellow or red it is always in connection with some 
surface, or object; when we taste sour, this quality be- 
longs to some substance, and so on with all the senses. 
Yet by sensation we mean only the simple qualities of 
objects known in consciousness as the result of appro- 
priate stimuli applied to end-organs. We shall later see 
how by perception these qualities fuse or combine to 
form objects, but in the present chapter we shall be con- 
cerned with the qualities only. Sensations are, then, 
the simplest and most elementary knowledge we may 
get from the physical world,—the red, the blue, the bit- 
ter, the cold, the fragrant, and whatever other qualities 
may belong to the external world. We shall not for the 
present be concerned with the objects or sources from 
which the qualities may come. 
To quote James on the meaning of sensation: ‘‘All 
we can say on this point is that what we mean by sen- 
sations are first things in the way of consciousness. They 
are the immediate results upon consciousness of nerve 
currents as they enter the brain, and before they have 
awakened any suggestions or associations with past ex- 
perience. But it is obvious that such immediate sensa- 
tions can be realized only in the earliest days of life.’’ 
The Attributes of Sensation—Sensations differ from 
each other in at least four respects; namely, quality, 
intensity, extensity, and duration. 
It is a difference in quality that makes us say, ‘‘This 
paper is red, and that, blue; this liquid is sweet, and 
that, sour.’’ Differences in quality are therefore funda-
-P-A-G-E-108
  90 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
mental differences in kind. Besides the quality-differ- 
ences that exist within the same general field, as of taste 
or vision, it is evident that there is a still more funda- 
mental difference existing between the various fields. 
One can, for example, compare red with blue or sweet 
with sour, and tell which quality he prefers. But let 
him try to compare red with sweet, or blue with sour, 
and the quality-difference is so profound that there 
seems to be no basis for comparison. 
Differences in intensity of sensation are familiar to 
every person who prefers two lumps of sugar rather 
than one lump in his coffee; the sweet is of the same 
quality in either case, but differs in intensity. In every 
field of sensation, the intensity may proceed from the 
smallest amount to the greatest amount discernible. In 
general, the intensity of the sensation depends on the 
intensity of the stimulus, though the condition of the 
sense-organ as regards fatigue or adaptation to the stim- 
ulus has its effect. It is obvious that a stimulus may be 
too weak to produce any sensation; as, for example, a 
few grains of sugar in a cup of coffee or a few drops 
of lemon in a quart of water could not be detected. It 
is also true that the intensity of the stimulus may be 
so great that an increase in intensity produces no effect 
on the sensation; as, for example, the addition of sugar 
to a solution of saccharine would not noticeably increase 
its sweetness. The lowest and highest intensity points 
of sensation are called the lower and upper limen, or 
threshold, respectively. 
By extensity is meant’ the space-differences of sen- 
sations. The touch of the point of a toothpick on the 
skin has a different space quality from the touch of 
the flat end of a pencil. Low tones seem to have more 
volume than high tones. Some pains feel sharp and
-P-A-G-E-109
  SENSATION 91 
others dull and diffuse. The warmth felt from spread- 
ing the palms of the hands out to the fire has a ‘‘big- 
ness’’ not felt from heating one solitary finger. The 
extensity of a sensation depends on the number of nerve 
endings stimulated. 
The duration of a sensation refers to the time it lasts. 
This must not be confused with the duration of the 
stimulus, which may be either longer or shorter than 
the duration of the sensation. Every sensation must 
exist for some space of time, long or short, or it would 
have no part in consciousness. 
8. SENSORY QUALITIES AND THEIR END-ORGANS 
All are familiar with the ‘‘five senses’’ of our ele- 
mentary physiologies, sight, hearing, taste, smell, and 
touch. A more complete study of sensation reveals 
nearly three times this number, however. This is to say 
that the body is equipped with more than a dozen 
different kinds of end-organs, each prepared to receive 
its own particular type of stimulus. It must also be un- 
derstood that some of the end-organs yield more than 
one sense. The eye, for example, gives not only visual 
but muscular sensations; the ear not only auditory, but 
tactual; the tongue not only gustatory, but tactual and 
cold and warmth sensations. 
Sight.—Vision is a distance sense; we can see afar off. 
The stimulus is chemical in its action; this means that 
the ether waves, on striking the retina, cause a chemical 
change which sets up the nerve current responsible for 
the sensation. 
The eye, whose general structure is sufficiently de- 
scribed in all standard physiologies, consists of a visual 
apparatus designed to bring the images of objects to a
-P-A-G-E-110
92 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
  clear focus on the retina at the fovea, or area of clearest 
vision, near the point of entrance of the optic nerve. 
The sensation of sight coming from this retinal image 
unaided by other sensations gives us but two qualities, 
light and color. The eye can distinguish many dif- 
ferent grades of light from purest white on through the 
various grays to densest black. The range is greater 
still in color. We speak of the seven colors of the spec- 
trum, violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, and red. 
But this is not a very serviceable classification, sinee 
the average eye can distinguish about 35,000 color 
effects. It is also somewhat bewildering to find that all 
these colors seem to be produced from the four funda- 
mental hues, red, green, yellow, and blue, plus the 
various tints. These four, combined in varying propor- 
tions and with different degrees of light (i-e., different 
shades of gray), yield all the color effects known to the 
human eye. Herschel estimates that the workers on the 
mosaics at Rome must have distinguished 30,000 differ- 
ent color tones. The hue of a color refers to its funda- 
mental quality, as red or yellow; the chroma, to its 
saturation, or the strength: of the color; and the tint, 
to the amount of brightness (ie., white) it contains. 
Hearing.—THearing is also a distance sense. The ac- 
tion of its stimulus is mechanical, which is to say that 
the vibrations produced in the air by the sounding body 
are finally transmitted by the mechanism of the middle 
ear to the inner ear.. Here the impulse is conveyed 
through the liquid of the internal ear to the nerve end- 
ings as so many tiny blows, which produce the nerve cur- 
rent carried to the brain by the auditory nerve. 
The sensation of hearing, like that of sight, gives us 
two qualities: namely, tones with their accompanying 
pitch and timbre, and noises. Tones, or musical sounds,
-P-A-G-E-111
  SENSATION 93. 
are produced by isochronous or equal-timed vibrations ; 
thus C of the first octave is produced by 256 vibrations 
a second, and if this tone is prolonged the vibration 
rate will continue uniformly the same. Noises, on the 
other hand, are produced by vibrations which have no 
uniformity of vibration rate. The ear’s sensibility to 
pitch extends over about seven octaves. The seven-oc- 
tave piano goes down to 2714 vibrations and reaches up 
to 3,500 vibrations. Notes of nearly 50,000 vibrations can 
be heard by an average ear, however, though these are 
too painfully shrill to be musical. Taking into account 
this upper limit, the range of the ear is about eleven 
octaves. The ear, having given us loudness of tones, 
which depends on the amplitude of the vibrations, pitch, 
which depends on the rapidity of the vibrations, and 
timbre, or quality, which depends on the complexity 
of the vibrations, has no further qualities of sound to. 
reveal. 
Taste—The sense of taste is located chiefly in the 
tongue, over the surface of which are scattered many 
minute taste-bulbs. These can be seen as small red 
specks, most plentifully distributed along the edges and 
at the tip of the tongue. The substance tasted must 
be in solution, and come in contact with the nerve end- 
ings. The action of the stimulus is chemical. 
The sense of taste recognizes the four qualities of 
sour, sweet, salt, and bitter. Many of the qualities. 
which we improperly eall tastes are in reality a com- 
plex of taste, smell, touch, and temperature. Smell con- 
tributes so largely to the sense of taste that many ar- 
ticles of food become ‘‘tasteless’’ when we have a catarrh, 
and many nauseating doses of medicine can be taken 
without discomfort if the nose is held. (Probably none 
of us, if we are careful to exclude all odors by plugging  
-P-A-G-E-112
94 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
  the nostrils with cotton, can by taste distinguish between 
scraped apple, potato, turnip, or beet, or can tell hot 
milk from tea or coffee of the same temperature.) ; 
Smell.—In the upper part of the nasal cavity lies az 
small brownish patch of mucous membrane. It is hare a a 
that the olfactory nerve endings are located. The sub- 
stance smelled must be volatile, that is, must exist in 
gaseous form, and come in direct contact with the nerve 
endings. Chemical action results in a nerve current. 
The sensations of smell have not been classified so well 
as those of taste, and we have no distinct names for 
them. Neither do we know how many olfactory quali- 
ties the sense of smell is capable of revealing. The only 
definite classification of smell qualities is that based on 
their pleasantness or the opposite. We also borrow a 
few terms and speak of sweet or fragrant odors and 
fresh or close smells. There is some evidence when we 
observe animals, or even primitive men, that the human 
race has been evolving greater sensibility to certain 
odors; while at the same time there has been a loss of 
keenness of what we call scent. 
Various Sensations from the Skin.—The skin, besides 
being a protective and excretory organ, affords a lodg- 
ing-place for the end-organs giving us our sense of pres- 
sure, pain, cold, warmth, tickle, and itch. Pressure 
seems to have for its end-organ the hair-bulbs of the 
skin ; on hairless regions small bulbs called the corpuscles 
of Meissner serve this purpose. Pain is thought to be 
mediated by free nerve endings. Cold depends on end- 
organs called the bulbs of Krause; and warmth on the 
Ruffinian corpuscles. 
Cutaneous or skin sensation may arise from either 
mechanical stimulation, such as pressure, a blow, or 
tickling, from thermal stimulation from hot or cold ob-
-P-A-G-E-113
  SENSATION 95 
jects, from electrical stimulation, or from the action of 
certain chemicals, such as acids and the like. Stimulated 
mechanically, the skin gives us but two sensation quali- 
ties, pressure and pain. Many of the qualities which we 
commonly ascribe to the skin sensations are really a com- 
plex of cutaneous and muscular sensations. Contact is 
light pressure. Hardness and softness depend on the 
intensity of the pressure. Roughness and smoothness 
arise from interrupted and continuous pressure, respec- 
  Fie. 17.—Diagram showing distribution of hot and cold spots on the 
back of the hand. C, cold spots; H, hot spots. 
tively, and require movement over the rough or smooth 
surface. Touch depends on pressure accompanied by 
the muscular sensations involved in the movements con- 
nected with the act. Pain is clearly a different sensa- 
tion from pressure; but any of the cutaneous or mus- 
cular sensations may, by excessive stimulation, be made 
to pass over into pain. All parts of the skin are sen- 
sitive to pressure and pain; but certain parts, like 
the finger tips, and the tip of the tongue, are more 
highly sensitive than others. The skin varies also in its 
sensitivity to heat and cold. If we take a hot or a very 
cold pencil point and pass it rather lightly and slowly 
over the skin, it is easy to discover certain spots from. 
which a sensation of warmth or of cold flashes out. In 
this way it is possible to locate the end-organs of tem- 
perature very accurately.
-P-A-G-E-114
96 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
  The Kinesthetic Senses—The muscles, tendons, and 
joints also give rise to perfectly definite sensations, but 
they have not been named as have the sensations from 
most of the other end-organs. Weight is the most clearly 
marked of these sensations. It is through the sensa- 
tions connected with movements of muscles, tendons, and 
joints that we come to judge form, size, and distance. 
The Organic Senses.—Finally, to the sensations men- 
tioned so far must be added those which come from the 
internal organs of the body. From the alimentary canal 
we get the sensations of hunger, thirst, and nausea; from 
the heart, lungs, and organs of sex come numerous well- 
defined but unnamed sensations which play an impor- 
tant part in making up the feeling-tone of our daily 
lives. 
Thus we see that the senses may be looked upon as the 
sentries of the body, standing at the outposts where na- 
ture and ourselves meet. They discover the qualities 
of the various objects with which we come in contact 
and hand them over to the mind in the form of sensa- 
tions. And these sensations are the raw material out of 
which we begin to construct our material environment. 
Only as we are equipped with good organs of sense, 
especially good eyes and ears, therefore, are we able to 
enter fully into the wonderful world about us and re- 
ceive the stimuli necessary to our thought and action. 
4, PROBLEMS IN OBSERVATION AND INTROSPECTION 
1. Observe a schoolroom of children at work with the aim 
of discovering any that show defects of vision or hearing. 
What are the symptoms? What is the effect of aoe to 
hear or see well upon interest and attention? 
2. Talk with your teacher about testing the eyes and ears 
of the children of some school. The simpler tests for vision
-P-A-G-E-115
SENSATION 97 
and hearing are easily applied, and the expense for material 
almost nothing. What tests should be used? Does your _ 
school have the test card for vision? 
3. Use a rotator or color tops for mixing dises of white 
and black to produce different shades of gray. Fix in mind 
the gray made of half white and half black; three-fourths 
white and one-fourth black; one-fourth white and three-fourths 
black. 
4. In the same way mix the two complementaries yellow 
and blue to produce a gray; mix red and green in the same 
way. ‘Try various combinations of the four fundamental col- 
ors, and discover how different colors are produced. Seek for 
these same colors in nature—sky, leaves, flowers, ete. 
5. Take a large wire nail and push it through a cork so that 
it can be handled without touching the metal with the fingers. 
Now cool it in ice or very cold water, then dry it and move 
the point slowly across the back of the hand. Do you feel 
occasional thrills of cold as the point passes over a bulb of 
Krause? Heat the nail with a match flame or over a lamp, 
and perform the same experiment. Do you feel the thrills of 
heat from the corpuscles of Ruffini?

CHAPTER VII 
PERCEPTION 
No young child at first sees objects as we see them, or 
hears sounds as we hear them. This powers the power 
of perception, is a gradual development. It grows day 
by day out of the learner’s experience in his world of 
sights and sounds, and whatever other fields his senses 
respond to. 
1, THE FUNCTION OF PERCEPTION 
  Need of Knowing the Material World.—It is the busi- 
ness of perception to give us knowledge of our world of 
. material objects and their relations in space and. time. 
The material world which we enter through the gate- 
ways of the senses is more marvelous by far than any 
fairy world created by the fancy of story-tellers; for 
it contains the elements of all they have conceived and 
much more besides. It is more marvelous than any 
structure planned and executed by the mind of man; 
for all the wonders and beauties of the Coliseum or of 
St. Peter’s existed in nature before they were discoy- 
ered by the architect and thrown together in those mag- 
nificent structures. The material advancement of civili- 
zation has been but the discovery of the objects, forces, 
and laws of nature, and their use in inventions service- 
able to men. And these forces and laws of nature were 
discovered only as they were made manifest through 
objects in the material world. 
98
-P-A-G-E-117
  PERCEPTION 99 
The problem lying before each individual who would 
enter fully into this rich world of environment, then, is 
to discover at first hand just as large a part of the ma- 
terial world about him as possible. In the most humble 
environment of the most uneventful life is to be found 
the material for discoveries and ‘inventions yet un- 
dreamed of. Lying in the shade of an apple tree under 
the open sky, Newton read from a falling apple the fun-, 
damental principles of the law of gravitation which 
has revolutionized science ; sitting at a humble tea table 
Watt watched the gurgling of the steam escaping from 
the kettle, and evolved the steam engine therefrom; with 
his simple kite, Franklin drew down the lightning from 
the clouds, and started the science of electricity ; through 
studying a ball, the ancient scholars conceived the earth 
to be a sphere, and Columbus discovered America. 
The Problem Which Confronts the Child—Well it is 
that the child, starting his life’s journey, cannot see the 
magnitude of the task before him. Cast amid a world 
of objects of whose very existence he is ignorant, and 
whose meaning and uses have to be learned by slow and 
often painful experience, he proceeds step by step 
through the senses in his discovery of the objects about. 
him. Yet, considered again, we ourselves are after all 
but a step in advance of the child. Though we are 
somewhat more familiar with the use of our senses than 
he, and know a few more objects about us, yet the knowl- 
edge of the wisest of us is at best pitifully meager com- 
pared with the richness of nature. So impossible is it 
for us to know all our material environment, that men 
have taken to becoming specialists. One man will spend 
his life in the study of a certain variety of plants, while 
there are hundreds of thousands of varieties all about 
him; another will study a particular kind of animal life,
-P-A-G-E-118
100 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
perhaps too minute to be seen with the naked eye, while 
the world is teeming with animal forms which he has 
not time in his short day of life to stop to examine; 
another will study the land forms and read the earth’s 
history from the rocks and geological strata, but here 
again nature’s volume is so large that he has time to 
read but a small fraction of the whole. Another studies 
the human body and learns to read from its expressions 
the signs of health and sickness, and to prescribe reme- 
dies for its ills; but in this field also he has found it 
necessary to divide the work, and so we have specialists 
for almost every organ of the body. 
  2. THE NATURE OF PERCEPTION 
How a Percept is Formed.—HMow, then, do we proceed 
to the discovery of this world of objects? Let us watch 
the child and learn the secret from him. Give the babe 
a ball, and he applies every sense to it to discover its 
qualities. He stares at it, he takes it in his hands and 
turns it over and around, he lifts it, he strokes it, he 
punches it and jabs it, he puts it to his mouth and bites 
it, he drops it, he throws it and creeps after it. He 
leaves no stone unturned to find out what that thing 
really is. By means of the qualities which come to him 
through the avenues of sense, he constructs the object. 
And not only does he come to know the ball as a ma- 
terial object, but he comes to know also its uses. He is 
forming his own best definition of a ball in terms of 
the sensations which he gets from it and the uses to 
which he puts it, and all this even before he can name 
it or is able to recognize its name when he hears it. How 
much better his method than the one he will have to 
follow a little later when he goes to school and learns
-P-A-G-E-119
NN 
PERCEPTION 101 
that ‘‘A ball is a spherical body of any substance or size, 
used to play with, as by throwing, kicking, or knocking, 
ete.!”’ 
The Percept Involves All Relations of the Object—Nor 
is the ease in the least different with ourselves. When 
we wish to learn about a new object or discover new 
facts about an old one, we do precisely as the child does 
if we are wise. We apply to it every sense to which it 
will afford a stimulus, and finally arrive at the object / 
through its various qualities. And just in so far as we 
have failed to use in connection with it every sense to 
which it can minister, just in that degree will we have 
an incomplete perception of it. Indeed, just so far as 
we have failed finally to perceive it in terms of its func- 
tions or uses, in that far also have we failed to know 
it completely. Tomatoes were for many years grown 
as ornamental garden plants before it was discovered 
that the tomatoes could minister to the taste as well 
as to the sight. The clothing of civilized man gives the 
same sensation of texture and color to the savage that 
it does to its owner, but he is so far from perceiving it in 
the same way that he packs it away and continues to go 
naked. The Orientals, who disdain the use of chairs 
and prefer to sit cross-legged on the floor, can never 
perceive a chair just as we do who use chairs daily, and 
to whom chairs are so saturated with social suggestions 
and associations. 
The Content of the Percept.'The percept, then, always 
‘contains a basis of sensation.) The eye, the ear, the 
skin or some other sense organ must turn in its supply of 
sensory material or there can be no percept. But the 
percept contains more than just sensations. Consider, 
for example, your percept of an automobile flashing past 
your windows. You really see but very little of it, yet
-P-A-G-E-120
  102 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
you perceive it as a very familiar vehicle. All that your 
sense organs furnish is a more or less blurred patch of 
black of certain size and contour, one or more objects of 
somewhat different color whom you know to be passen- 
gers, and various sounds of a whizzing, chugging or roar- 
ing nature. Your former experience with automobiles 
enables you to associate with these meager sensory de- 
tails the upholstered seats, the whirling wheels, the 
swaying movement and whatever else belongs to the full 
meaning of a motor ear. 
( The percept that contained only sensory material, and 
lacked all memory elements, ideas and meanings, would 
be no percept at all.\/ And this is the reason why a young _ 
child cannot see or hear like ourselves. It lacks the as- 
sociative material to give significance and meaning to 
the sensory elements supplied by the end-organs. ) The 
dependence of the percept on material from past ex- 
perience is also illustrated in the common statement that 
what one gets from an art exhibit or a concert depends 
on what he brings to it. He who brings no knowledge, 
no memory, no images from other pictures or musie will 
secure but relatively barren percepts, consisting of little 
besides the mere sensory elements. Truly, ‘‘to him that 
hath shall be given’’ in the.realm of perception. 
The Accuracy of Percepts Depends on Experience.—We 
must perceive objects through our motor response to 
them as well as in terms of sensations. The boy who 
has his knowledge of a tennis racket from looking at one 
in a store window, or indeed from handling one and 
looking it over in his room, can never know a tennis 
racket as does the boy who plays with it on the court. 
Objects get their significance not alone from their. quali- 
ties, but even more from their use as related to our own 
activities.
-P-A-G-E-121
  PERCEPTION 103 
Like the child, we must get our knowledge of ob- 
jects, if we are to get it well, from the objects themselves 
at first hand, and not second hand through descriptions 
of. them by others. The fact that there is so much 
of the material world about us that we can never hope 
to learn it all, has made it necessary to put down in 
books many of the things which have been discovered 
concerning nature. This necessity has, I fear, led many 
away from nature itself to books—away from the liv- 
ing reality of things to the dead embalming cases of 
words, in whose empty forms we see so little of the sig- 
nificance which resides in the things themselves. We 
are in danger of being satisfied with the forms of knowl- 
edge without its substance—with definitions contained 
in words instead of in qualities and uses. 
Not Definitions, But First-hand Contact.—In like man- 
ner we come to know distance, form and size. If we 
have never become acquainted with a mile by actually 
walking a mile, running a mile, riding a bicycle a mile, 
driving a horse a mile, or traveling a mile on a train, we 
might listen for a long time to someone tell how far a 
mile is, or state the distance from Chicago to Denver, 
without knowing much about it in any way except word 
definitions. In order to understand a mile, we must 
come to know it in as many ways as possible through 
sense activities of our own. Although many children 
have learned that it is 25,000 miles around the earth, 
probably no one who has not encircled the globe has 
any reasonably accurate notion just how far this is. For 
words cannot take the place of perceptions in giving us 
knowledge. In the case of shorter distances, the same 
rule holds. The eye must be assisted by experience of 
the muscles and tendons and joints in actually covering 
distance, and learn to associate these sensations with J
-P-A-G-E-122
  104 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
those of the eye before the eye alone can be able to say, 
“That tree is ten rods distant.’’ Form and size are to 
be learned in the same way. The hands must actually 
touch and handle the object, experiencing its hardness or 
smoothness, the way this curve and that angle feels, the 
amount of muscular energy it takes to pass the hand 
over this surface and along that line, the eye taking note 
all the while, before the eye can tell at a glance that 
yonder object is a sphere and that this surface is two 
feet on the edge. 
3. THE PERCEPTION OF SPACE 
Many have been the philosophical controversies over 
the nature of-space and our perception of it. The psy- 
chologists have even quarreled concerning whether we 
possess an innate sense of space, or whether it is a prod- 
uct of experience and training. Fortunately, for our 
present purpose we shall not need to concern ourselves 
with either of these controversies. For our discussion 
we may accept space for what common sense under- 
stands it to be. As to our sense of space, whatever of 
this we may possess at birth, it certainly has to be devel- 
oped by use and experience to become of practical value. 
In the perception of space we must come to perceive 
distance, direction, size, and form. As a matter of fact, 
however, size is but so much distance, and form is but 
so much distance in this, that, or the other direction. 
The Perceiving of Distance——Unquestionably the eye 
comes to be our chief dependence in determining dis- 
tance. Yet the muscle and joint senses give us our earli- 
est knowledge of distance. The babe reaches for the 
moon simply because the eye does not tell it that the 
moon is out of reach. Only as the child reaches for its 
 
-P-A-G-E-123
  PERCEPTION 105 
playthings, creeps or walks after them, and in a 
thousand ways uses its muscles and joints in measuring 
distance, does the perception of distance become de- 
pendable. 
At the same time the eye is slowly developing its power 
of judging distance. But not for several years does 
visual perception of distance become in any degree ac- 
curate. The eye’s perception of distance depends in part i 
on the sensations arising from the muscles controlling 
the eye, probably in part from the adjustment of the 
lens, and in part from the retinal image. If one tries 
to look at the tip of his nose he easily feels the muscle 
strain caused by the required angle of adjustment. We 
come unconsciously to associate distance with the muscle 
sensations arising from the different angles of vision. 
The part played by the retinal image in judging distance 
is easily understood in looking at two trees, one thirty 
feet and the other three hundred feet distant. We note 
that the nearer tree shows the detail of the bark and 
leaves, while the more distant one lacks this detail. The 
nearer tree also reflects more light and color than the 
one farther away. These minute differences, registered 
as they are on the retinal image, come to stand for so 
much of distance. 
The ear also learns to perceive distance through dif- 
ferences in the quality and the intensity of sound. Au- 
ditory perception of distance is, however, never very 
accurate. 
The Perceiving of Direction.—The motor senses prob-/ 
ably give us our first perception of direction, as they do 
of distance. The child has to reach this way or that 
way for his rattle; turn the eyes or head so far in order 
to see an interesting object; twist the body, crawl or 
walk to one side or the other to secure his bottle. In
-P-A-G-E-124
  106 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
these experiences he is gaining his first knowledge of di- 
rection. 
Along with these muscle-joint experiences, the eye is 
also being trained. The position of the image on the 
retina comes to stand for direction, and the eye finally 
develops so remarkable a power of perceiving direction 
that a picture hung a half inch out of plumb is a source 
of annoyance. The ear develops some skill in the per- 
ception of direction, but is less dependable than the eye. 
4, THE PERCEPTION OF TIME 
The philosophers and psychologists agree little better 
about our sense of time than they do about our sense of 
space. Of this much, however, we may be certain, our 
perception of time is subject to development and train- 
ing. 
Nature of the Time Sense.—How we perceive time is 
not so well understood as our perception of space. It is 
evident, however, that our idea of time is simpler than 
our idea of space—it has less of content, less that we can 
describe. Probably the most fundamental part of our 
,idea of time is progression, or change, without which it 
Nis difficult to think of time at all. The question then 
becomes, how do we perceive change, or succession? 
If one looks in upon his thought stream he finds that 
the movement of consciousness is not uniformly con- 
tinuous, but that his thought moves in pulses, or short 
rushes, so to speak. When we are seeking for some fact. 
or conclusion, there is a moment of expectancy, or pois- 
ing, and then the leap forward to the desired point, or 
conclusion, from which an immediate start is taken for 
the next objective point of our thinking. It is probable 
that our sense of the few seconds of passing time that
-P-A-G-E-125
  PERCEPTION 107° 
we call the immediate present consists of the recognition 
of the succession of these pulsations of consciousness, to- 
gether with certain organic rhythms, such as heart beat 
and breathing. 
No Perception of Empty time.—Our perception does 
not therefore act upon empty time.“ Time must be filled 
with a procession of events, whether these be within our 
own consciousness or in the objective world without. 
All longer periods of time, such as hours, days, or years, 
are measured by the events which they contain. Time 
filled with happenings that interest and attract us seems 
short while passing, but longer when looked back upon. 
On the other hand, time relatively empty of interesting 
experience hangs heavy on our hands in passing, but, 
viewed in retrosect, seems short. A fortnight of travel 
passes more quickly than a fortnight of illness, but 
yields many more events for the memory to review as the 
‘*filling’’ for time. 
Probably no one has any very accurate feeling of the 
length, that is, the actual duration of a year—or even 
of a month! We therefore divide time into convenient 
units, as weeks, months, years and centuries. This al- 
lows us to think of time in mathematical terms where 
immediate perception fails in its grasp. 
5. THE TRAINING OF PERCEPTION 
In the physical world as in the spiritual there are 
many people who, ‘‘having eyes, see not and ears, hear 
not.’’ For the ability to perceive accurately and richly 
in the world of physical objects depends not alone on 
good sense organs, but also on interest and the habit 
of observation. It is easy if we are indifferent or un- 
trained to look at a beautiful landscape, a picture or a
-P-A-G-E-126
108 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
cathedral without seeing it; it is easy if we lack interest 
or skill to listen to an orchestra or the myriad sounds of 
nature without hearing them. 
Perception Needs to Be Trained.—Training in percep- 
tion does not depend entirely on the work of the school. 
For the world about us exerts a constant appeal to our 
senses. A thousand sights, sounds, contacts, tastes, 
smells or other sensations, hourly throng in upon us, 
and the appeal is irresistible. We must in some degree 
attend. We must observe. 
Yet it cannot be denied that most of us are relatively 
unskilled in perception; we do not know how, or take 
the trouble to observe. For example, a stranger was 
brought into the classroom and introduced by the in- 
structor to a class of fifty college students in psychology. 
The class thought the stranger was to address them, and 
looked at him with mild curiosity. But, after standing 
before them for a few moments, he suddenly withdrew, 
as had been arranged by the instructor. The class were 
then asked to write such a description of the stranger 
as would enable a person who had never seen him to iden- 
tify him. But so poor had been the observation of the 
class that they ascribed to him clothes of four different 
colors, eyes and hair each of three different colors, a tie 
of many different hues, height ranging from five feet 
and four inches to over six feet, age from twenty-eight 
to forty-five years, and many other details as wide of 
the mark. Nor is it probable that this particular class 
was below the average in the power of perception. 
School Training in Perception—The school can do 
much in training the perception. But to accomplish 
this, the child must constantly be brought into immedi- 
ate contact with the physical world about him and taught 
to observe. Books must not be substituted for things. 
  V
-P-A-G-E-127
    PERCEPTION 108 
Definitions must not take the place of experiment or dis- 
covery. Geography and nature study ‘should be taught 
largely out of doors, and the lessons assigned should take 
the child into the open for observation and investigation. 
All things that live and grow, the sky and clouds, the 
sunset colors, the brown of upturned soil, the smell of 
the clover field, or the new mown hay, the sounds of a 
summer night, the distinguishing marks by which to 
identify each family of common birds or breed of eat- 
tle—these and a thousand other things that appeal to 
us from the simplest environment afford 4 rich oppor- 
tunity for training the perception. And he who has 
learned to observe, and who is alert to the appeal of 
nature, has no small part of his education already as- 
sured. 
6. PROBLEMS IN OBSERVATION AND INTROSPECTION 
1. Test your power of observation by walking rapidly past 
a well-filled store window and then seeing how many of the 
objects you can name. 
2. Suppose a tailor, a bootblack, a physician, and a detec- 
‘tive are standing on the street corner as you pass by. What 
will each one be most likely to observe about you? Why? 
3. Observe carefully green trees at a distance of a few 
rods; a quarter of a mile; a mile; several miles. Describe dif- 
ferences (1) in color, (2) in brightness, or light, and (3) in 
detail. 
4. How many common birds can you identify? How many 
kinds of trees? Of wild flowers? Of weeds? 
5. Observe the work of an elementary school for the pur- 
pose of determining: 
a. Whether the instruction in geography, nature study, 
agriculture, ete., calls for the use of the eyes, ears and fingers.. 
b. Whether definitions are used in place of first-hand in- 
formation in any subjects.
-P-A-G-E-128
  110 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
e. Whether the assignment of lessons to pupils includes 
work that would require the use of the senses, especially out 
of doors. 
d. Whether the work offered in arithmetic demands the use 
of the senses as well as the reason. 
e. Whether the language lessons make use of the power of 
observation.
-P-A-G-E-129
CHAPTER VIII 
MENTAL IMAGES AND IDEAS. 
As you sit thinking, a company of you together, your 
thoughts run in many diverse lines. Yet with all this 
diversity, your minds possess this common characteris- 
tie: Though your thinking all takes place in what we 
call the present moment, it goes on largely in terms 
of past experiences. 
1. THE PART PLAYED BY PAST EXPERIENCE 
Present Thinking Depends on Past Experience.—Images 
or ideas of things you have seen or heard or felt; of 
things you have thought of before and which now recur 
to you; of things you remember, such as names, dates, 
places, events; of things that you do not remember as a 
part of your past at all, but that belong to it neverthe- 
less—these are the things which form a large part of 
your mental stream, and which give content to your 
thinking. You may think of a thing that is going on 
now, or of one that is to occur in the future; but, after 
all, you are dependent on your past experience for the 
material which you put into your thinking of the pres- 
ent moment. 
Indeed, nothing can enter your present thinking which 
does not link itself to something in your past experience. 
The savage Indian in the primeval forest never thought 
about killing a deer with a rifle merely by pulling a 
Ali
-P-A-G-E-130
  112 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
trigger, or of turning a battery of machine guns on 
his enemies to annihilate them—none of these things 
were related to his past experience; hence he could not 
think in such terms. 
The Present Interpreted by the Past.—Not only can we 
not think at all except in terms of our past experience, 
but even if-we could, the present would be meaningless 
to us; for the present is interpreted in the light of the ¥ 
past. The sedate man of affairs who decries athletic 
sports, and has never taken part in them, cannot under- 
stand the wild enthusiasm which prevails between rival 
teams in a hotly contested event. The fine work of art 
is to the one who has never experienced the appeal which 
comes through beauty, only so much of canvas and varie- 
gated patches of color. Paul says that Jesus was ‘‘unto 
the Greeks, foolishness.’? He was foolishness to them 
because nothing in their experience with their own gods 
had been enough like the character of Jesus to enable 
them to interpret Him. 
The Future Also Depends on the Past.—To the mind in- 
capable of using past experience, the future also would 
be impossible; for we can look forward into the future 
only by placing in its experiences the elements of which ~ 
we have already known. The savage who has never 
seen the shining yellow metal does not dream of a heaven 
whose streets are paved with gold, but rather of a 
“happy hunting ground.’’ If you will analyze your own 
dreams of the future you will see in them familiar pic- 
tures perhaps grouped together in new forms, but com- 
ing, in their elements, from your past experience never- 
theless. All that would remain to a mind devoid of a 
past would be the little bridge of time which we call the 
“‘present moment,’? a series of unconnected nows. 
Thought would be impossible, for the mind would have 
 
-P-A-G-E-131
  MENTAL IMAGES AND IDEAS 113 
nothing to compare and relate. Personality would not 
exist; for personality requires continuity of experience, 
else we should be.a new person each succeeding mo- 
ment, without memory and without plans. Such a mind 
would be no mind at all. i 
Rank Determined by Ability to Utilize Past Experience. 
—So important is past experience in determining our 
present thinking and guiding our future actions, that 
the place of an individual in the scale of creation is de- 
termined largely by the ability to profit by past experi- 
ence. The scientist tells us of many species of animals 
now extinct, which lost their lives and suffered their 
race to die out because when, long ago, the climate be- 
gan to change and grow much colder, they were un- 
able to use the experience of suffering in the last cold 
season as an incentive to provide shelter, or move to a 
warmer climate against the coming of the next and more 
rigorous one. Man was able to make the adjustment; 
and, providing himself with clothing and shelter and 
food, he survived, while myriads of the lower forms per- 
ished. 
The singed moth again and again dares the flame 
which tortures it, and at last gives its life, a sacrifice to 
its folly; the burned child fears the fire, and does not 
the second time seek the experience. So also can the effi- 
ciency of an individual or a nation, as compared with 
other individuals or nations, be determined. The ineffi- 
cient are those who repeat the same error or useless act 
over and over, or else fail to repeat a chance useful act 
whose repetition might lead to success. They are unable 
to learn their lesson and be guided by experience. Their 
past does not sufficiently minister to their present, and 
through it direct their future.

  114 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
2, HOW PAST EXPERIENCE IS CONSERVED 
Past Experience Conserved in Both Mental and Physical 
Terms.—If past experience plays so important a part in 
our welfare, how, then, is it to be conserved so that we 
may secure its benefits? Here, as elsewhere, we find the 
mind and body working in perfect unison and harmony, 
each doing its part to further the interests of both. The 
results of our past experience may be read in both our 
mental and our physical nature. 
On the physical side past experience is recorded in 
modified structure through the law of habit working on 
the tissues of the body, and particularly on the delicate 
tissues of the brain and nervous system. This is easily 
seen in its outward aspects. The stooped shoulders and 
bent form of the workman tell a tale of physical toil 
and exposure; the bloodless lips and pale face of the 
victim of the city sweat shop tell of foul air, long hours, 
and insufficient food; the rosy cheek and bounding step 
of childhood speak of fresh air, good food and happy 
play. 
On the mental side past experience is conserved chiefly 
by means of images, ideas, and concepts. The nature 
and function of concepts will be discussed in a later 
chapter. It will now be our purpose to examine the 
nature of images and ideas, and to note the part they 
play in the mind’s activities. 
The Image and the Idea.—To understand the nature of 
the image, and then of the idea, we may best go back to 
the percept. You look at a watch which I hold before 
your eyes and secure a percept of it. Briefly, this is 
what happens: The light reflected from the yellow 
object, on striking the retina, results in a nerve cur- 
rent which sets up a certain form of activity in the
-P-A-G-E-133
  MENTAL IMAGES AND IDEAS 115 
cells of the visual brain area, and lo! a percept of the 
watch flashes in your mind. 
Now I put the watch in my pocket, so that the stimu- 
lus is no longer present to your eye. Then I ask you 
to think of my watch just as it appeared as you were 
looking at it; or you may yourself choose to think of it 
without my suggesting it to you. In either case the 
cellular activity in the visual area of the cortex is re- 
produced approximately as it occurred in connection 
with the percept, and lo! an image of the watch flashes 
in your mind. An image is thus an approximate copy 
of a former percept (or several percepts). It is aroused 
indirectly by means of a nerve current coming by way 
of some other brain center, instead of directly by the 
stimulation of a sense organ, as in the case of a percept. 
If, instead of seeking a more or less exact mental pic- 
ture of my watch, you only think of its general meaning 
and relations, the fact that it is of gold, that it is for 
the purpose of keeping time, that it was a present to 
me, that I wear it in my left pocket, you then have an 
idea of the watch. Our idea of an object is, therefore, 
the general meaning of relations we ascribe to it. It 
should be remembered, however, that the terms image 
and idea are employed rather loosely, and that there is 
not yet general uniformity among writers in their use. 
All Our Past Experience Potentially at Our Command.— 
Images may in a certain sense take the place of per- 
cepts, and we can again experience sights, sounds, tastes, 
and smells which we have known before, without having 
the stimuli actually present to the senses. In this way 
all our past experience is potentially available to the 
present. All the objects we have seen, it is potentially 
‘possible again to see in the mind’s eye without being 
obliged to have the objects before us; all the sounds we
-P-A-G-E-134
116 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
have heard, all the tastes and smells and temperatures 
we have experienced, we may again have presented to 
our minds in the form of mental images without the 
various stimuli being present to the end-organs of the 
senses. 
Through images and ideas the total number of objects 
in our experience is infinitely multiplied; for many of 
the things we have seen, or heard, or smelled, or tasted, 
we cannot again have present to the senses, and without 
this power we would never get them again. And besides 
this fact, it would be inconvenient to have to go and 
secure afresh each sensation or percept every time we 
need to use it in our thought. While habit, then, con- 
serves our past experience on the physical side, the im-\ 
age and the idea do the same thing on the mental side. 
3. INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN IMAGERY 
Images to Be Viewed by Introspection.—The remainder 
of the description of images will be easier to understand, 
for each of you can know just what is meant in every 
case by appealing to your own mind. I beg of you not 
to think that I am presenting something new and strange, 
a curiosity connected with our thinking which has been 
discovered by scholars who have delved more deeply into 
the matter than we can hope to do. Every day—no, 
more than that, every hour and every moment—these 
images are flitting through our minds, forming a large 
part of our stream of consciousness. Let us see whether 
we can turn our attention within and discover some of 
our images in their flight. Let us introspect. 
I know of no better way to proceed than that adopted 
by Francis Galton years ago, when he asked the English 
men of letters and science to think of their breakfast 
 
-P-A-G-E-135
MENTAL IMAGES AND IDEAS 117 
tables, and then. describe the images which appeared. 
I am about to ask each one of you to do the same thing, 
but I want to warn you beforehand that the images will 
not be so vivid as the sensory experiences themselves. 
They will be much fainter and more vague, and less elear 
and definite ; they will be fleeting, and must be caught on 
the wing. Often the image may fade entirely out, and 
the idea only be left. 
The Varied Imagery Suggested by One’s Dining Table. 
—Let each one now recall the dining table as you last 
left it, and then answer questions concerning it like 
the following: 
Can I see clearly in my ‘‘mind’s eye’’ the whole table 
as it stood spread before me? Can I see all parts of it 
equally clearly? Do I get the snowy white and gloss 
of the linen? The delicate coloring of the china, so 
that I can see where the pink shades off into the white? 
The graceful lines and curves of the dishes? The sheen 
of the silver? The brown of the toast? The yellow 
of the cream? The rich red and dark green of the bou- 
quet of roses? The sparkle of the glassware? 
Can I again hear the rattle of the dishes? The clink 
of the spoon against the cup? The moving up of the 
chairs? The chatter of the voices, each with its own 
peculiar pitch and quality? The twitter of a bird 
outside the window? The tinkle of a distant bell? The 
chirp of a neighborly cricket ? 
Can I taste clearly the milk? The coffee? The eggs? 
The bacon? The rolls? -The butter? The jelly? The 
fruit? Can I get the appetizing odor of the coffee? Of 
the meat? The oranges and bananas? The perfume of 
the lilac bush outside the door? The perfume from a 
handkerchief newly treated to a spray of heliotrope? 
Can I recall the touch of my fingers on the velvety
-P-A-G-E-136
  118 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
peach? On the smooth skin of an apple? On the fret- 
ted glassware? The feel of the fresh linen? The con- 
tact of leather-covered or cane-seated chair? Of the 
freshly donned garment? Can I get clearly the tem- 
perature of the hot coffee in the mouth? Of the hot dish 
on the hand? Of the ice water? Of the grateful cool- 
ness of the breeze wafted in through the open window? 
Can I feel again the strain of muscle and joint in pass- 
ing the heavy dish? Can I feel the movement of the 
jaws in chewing the beefsteak? Of the throat and lips 
in talking? Of the chest and diaphragm in laughing? 
Of the muscles in sitting and rising? In hand and arm 
in using knife and fork and spoon? Can I get again the 
sensation of pain which accompanied biting on a ten- 
der tooth? From the shooting of a drop of acid from 
the rind of the orange into the eye? The chance ache 
in the head? The pleasant feeling connected with the 
exhilaration of a beautiful morning? The feeling of 
perfect health? The pleasure connected with partaking 
of a favorite food? 
Power of Imagery Varies in Different People—lIt is 
more than probable that some of you cannot get per- 
fectly clear images in all these lines, certainly not with 
equal facility ; for the imagery from any one sense varies 
greatly from person to person. A celebrated painter was 
able, after placing his subject in a chair and looking at 
him attentively for a few minutes, to dismiss the sub- 
ject and paint a perfect likeness of him from the visual 
image which recurred to the artist every time he turned 
his eyes to the chair where the sitter had been placed. 
On the other hand, a young lady, a student in my psy- 
chology class, tells me that she is never able to recall 
the looks of her mother when she is absent, even if the 
separation has been only for a few moments. She can
-P-A-G-E-137
  
MENTAL IMAGES AND IDEAS 119 
get an image of the form, with the color and cut of the 
dress, but never the features. One person may be able 
to recall a large part of a concert through his auditory 
imagery, and another almost none. 
In general it may be said that the power, or at least 
the use, of imagery decreases with age. The writer has 
made a somewhat extensive study of the imagery of cer- 
tain high-school students, college students, and special- 
ists in psychology averaging middle age. Almost with- 
out exception it was found that clear and vivid images 
played a smaller part in the thinking of the older group 
than of the younger. More or less abstract ideas and 
concepts seemed to have taken the place of the concrete 
imagery of earlier years. 
Imagery Types.—Although there is some difference in 
our ability to use imagery of different sensory types, 
probably there is less variation here than has been sup- 
posed. Earlier pedagogical works spoke of the viswal 
type of mind, or the audile type, or the motor type, as if 
the possession of one kind of imagery necessarily ren- 
dered a person short in other types. Later studies have 
shown this view incorrect, however. The person who 
has good images of one type is likely to excel in all 
types, while one who is lacking in any one of the more 
important types will probably be found short in all.t 
Most of us probably make more use of visual and audi- 
tory than of other kinds of imagery, while olfactory and 
gustatory images seem to play a minor rile. 
4, THE FUNCTION OF IMAGES 
Binet says that the man who has not every type of 
imagery almost equally well developed is only the frae- 
See Betts, “The Distribution and Functions of Menta? Imagery.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
  120 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
tion of a man. While this no doubt puts the matter too 
strongly, yet images do play an important part in our 
thinking. 
Images Supply Material for Imagination and Memory. 
—Imagery supplies the pictures from which imagina- 
tion builds its structures. Given a rich supply of im- 
ages from the various senses, and imagination has the 
material necessary to construct times and events long 
since past, or to fill the future with plans or experi- 
ences not yet reached. Lacking images, however, im- 
agination is handicapped, and its meager products re- 
veal in their barrenness and their lack of warmth and 
reality the poverty of material. 
Much of our memory also takes the form of images. 
The face of a friend, the sound of a voice, or the touch 
of a hand may be recalled, not as a mere fact, but with 
almost the freshness and fidelity of a percept. That 
much of our memory goes on in the form of ideas in- 
stead of images is true. But memory is often both aided 
in its accuracy and rendered more vital and signifi- 
cant through the presence of abundant imagery. 
Imagery in the Thought Processes——Since logical 
thinking deals more with relations and meanings than 
with particular objects, images naturally play a smaller 
part in reasoning than in memory and imagination. Yet 
they have their place here as well. Students of geometry 
or trigonometry often have difficulty in understanding 
a theorem until they succeed in visualizing the surface 
or solid involved. Thinking in the field of astronomy, 
mechanics, and many other sciences is assisted at cer- 
tain points by the ability to form clear and accurate im- 
ages. 
The Use of Imagery in Literature.—Facility in the use 
of imagery undoubtedly adds much to our enjoyment
-P-A-G-E-139
  MENTAL IMAGES AND IDEAS 121 
and appreciation of certain forms of literature. The 
great writers commonly use all types of images in their 
description and narration.” If we are not able to employ 
the images they used, many of their most beautiful pic- 
tures are likely to be to us but so many words suggesting 
prosaic ideas. 
Shakespeare, describing certain beautiful music, ap- 
peals to the sense of smell to make himself understood : 
. it came o’er my ear like the sweet sound 
That breathes upon a bank of violets, 
Stealing and giving odor! 
Lady Macbeth cries: 
Here’s the smell of the blood still: 
All the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten 
this little hand. 
Milton has Eve say of her dream of the fatal apple: 
... The pleasant sav’ry smell 
So quickened appetite, that I, methought, 
Could not but taste. 
Likewise with the sense of touch: 
. .. I take thy hand, this hand 
As soft as dove’s down, and as white as it. 
Imagine a person devoid of delicate tactile imagery, 
with senseless finger tips and leaden footsteps, undertak- 
ing to interpret these exquisite lines: 
Thus I set my printless feet 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
  122 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
O’er the cowslip’s velvet head, 
That bends not as I tread. 
Shakespeare thus appeals to the muscular imagery : 
At last, a little shaking of mine arm 
And thrice his head thus waving up and down, 
He raised a sigh so piteous and profound 
As it did seem to shatter all his bulk 
And end his being. 
Many passages like the following appeal to the tem- 
perature images: 
Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky, 
Thou dost not bite so nigh 
As benefits forgot! 
To one whose auditory imagery is meager, the follow- 
ing lines will lose something of their beauty : 
How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank! 
Here we will sit and let the sounds of musi¢e 
Creep in our ears; soft stillness and the night 
Become the touches of sweet harmony. 
Note how much clear images will add to Browning’s 
words: 
Are there not two moments in the adventure of a diver— 
one when a beggar he prepares to plunge, and one, when a 
prince he rises with his pearl? 
Points Where Images Are of Greatest Service.—Beyond 
question, many images come flooding into our minds 
which are irrelevant and of no service in our thinking. 
No one has failed to note many such. Further, we un-
-P-A-G-E-141
  MENTAL IMAGES AND IDEAS 123 
doubtedly do much of our best thinking with few or no 
images present. Yet we need images. Where, then, 
are they most needed? Images are needed wherever the 
percepts which they represent would be of service. 
Whatever one could better understand or enjoy or ap- 
preciate by seeing it, hearing it, or perceiving it through 
some other sense, he can better understand, enjoy or 
appreciate through images than by means of ideas only. 
ae 
5, THE CULTIVATION OF IMAGERY 
Images Depend on Sensory Stimuli—The power of 
imaging can be cultivated the same as any other abil- 
ity. 
In the first place, we may put down as an absolute 
requisite such an environment of sensory stimuli as will 
tempt every sense to be awake and at its best, that we 
may be led into a large acquaintance with the objects 
of our material environment. No one’s stock of sensory 
images is greater than the sum total of his sensory 
experiences. No one ever has images of sights, or sounds, 
or tastes, or smells which he has never experienced. 
Likewise, he must have had the fullest and freest pos- 
sible liberty in motor activities. For not only is the 
motor act itself made possible through the office of im- 
agery, but the motor act clarifies and makes useful the 
images. The boy who has actually made a table, or a 
desk, or a box has ever afterward a different and a better 
image of one of these objects than before; so also when 
he has owned and ridden a bicycle, his image of this 
machine will have a different significance from that of 
the image founded upon the visual perception alone of 
the wheel he longingly looked at through the store win- 
dow or in the other boy’s dooryard. v
-P-A-G-E-142
    124 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
The Influence of Frequent Recall—But sensory expe- 
riences and motor responses alone are not enough, 
though they are the basis of good imagery. There must 
Vbe frequent recall. The sunset may have been never so 
brilliant, and the music never so entrancing; but if they 
are never thought of and dwelt upon after they were 
first experienced, little will remain of them after a very 
short time. It is by repeating them often in experience 
through imagery that they become fixed, so that they 
stand ready to do our bidding when we need next to 
use them. 
The Reconstruction of Our Images.—To richness of ex- 
perience and frequency of the recall of our images we | 
must add one more factor; namely, that of their recon- ¥ 
struction or working over. Few if any images are ex- 
act recalls of former percepts of objects. Indeed, such 
would be neither possible nor desirable. The images 
which we recall are recalled for a purpose, or in view 
of some future activity, and hence must be selective, 
or made up of the elements of several or many former 
related images. 
Thus the boy who wishes to construct a box without a 
pattern to follow recalls the images of numerous boxes 
he may have seen, and from them all he has a new image 
made over from many former percepts and images, and 
this new image serves him as a working model. In this 
way he not only gets a copy which he can follow to make 
his box, but he also secures a new product in the form 
of an image different from any he ever had before, and 
is therefore by so much the richer. It is this working 
over of our stock of old images into new and richer and 
more suggestive ones that constitutes the essence of 
constructive imagination. 
The more types of imagery into which we can put our
-P-A-G-E-143
  MENTAL IMAGES AND IDEAS 125 
thought, the more fully is it ours and the better our 
images. The spelling lesson needs not only to be taken 
in through the eye, that we may retain a visual image 
of the words, but also to be recited orally, so that the 
ear may furnish an auditory image, and the organs of 
speech a motor image of the correct forms. It needs 
also to be written, and thus given into the keeping of the 
hand, which finally needs most of all to know and retain 
it. 
The reading lesson should be taken in through both the 
eye and the ear, and then expressed by means of voice 
and gesture in as full and complete a way as possible, 
that it may be associated with motor images. The geog- 
raphy lesson needs not only to be read, but to be drawn, 
or molded, or constructed. The history lesson should 
be made to appeal to every possible form of imagery. 
The arithmetic lesson must be not only computed, but 
measured, weighed, and pressed into actual service. 
Thus we might carry the illustration into every line 
of education and experience, and the same truth holds. 
What we desire to comprehend completely and retain 
well, we must apprehend through all available senses and 
conserve in every possible type of image and form of ex- 
pression. 
6. PROBLEMS IN INTROSPECTION AND OBSERVATION 
1. Observe a reading class and try to determine whether 
the pupils picture the scenes and events they read about. 
How can you tell? 
2. Similarly observe a history class. Do the pupils realize 
the events as actually happening, and the personages as real, 
living people? 
3. Observe in a similar way a class in geography, and 
draw conclusions. A pupil in computing the cost of plaster-
-P-A-G-E-144
  126 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
ing a certain room based the figures on the room filled full of 
plaster. How might visual imagery have saved the error? 
4. Imagine a three-inch eube. Paint it. Then saw it up 
into inch cubes, leaving them all standing in the original 
form. How many inch cubes have paint on three faces? How 
many on two faces? How many on one face? How many 
have no paint on them? Answer all these questions by re- 
ferring to your imagery alone. 
5. Try often to recall images in the various sensory lines; 
determine in what classes of images you are least proficient 
and try to improve in these lines. 
6. How is the singing teacher able, after his class has 
sung through several scores, to tell that they are flatting? 
7. Study your imagery carefully for a few days to see 
whether you can discover your predominating type of im- 
agery.
-P-A-G-E-145
  CHAPTER IX 
IMAGINATION 
Everyone desires to have a good imagination, yet not 
all would agree as to what constitutes a good imagina- 
tion. If I were to ask a group of you whether you have 
good imaginations, many of you would probably at once 
fall to considering whether you are capable of taking 
wild flights into impossible realms of thought and evoly- 
ing unrealities out of airy nothings. You would com- 
pare yourself with great imaginative writers, such as 
Stevenson, Poe, De Quincey, and judge your power of 
imagination by your ability to produce such tales as 
made them famous. 
1. THE PLACE OF IMAGINATION IN MENTAL ECONOMY 
But such a measure for the imagination as that just 
stated is far too narrow. A good imagination, like a 
good memory, is the one which serves its owner best. 
If DeQuincey and Poe and Stevenson and Bulwer found 
the type which led them into such dizzy flights the best 
for their particular purpose, well and good; but that is 
not saying that their type is the best for you, or that you 
may not rank as high in some other field of imaginative 
power as they in theirs. While you may lack in their 
particular type of imagination, they may have been 
short in the type which will one day make you famous. 
The artisan, the architect, the merchant, the artist, 
‘127
-P-A-G-E-146
  128 THE MIND AND is EDUCATION 
the farmer, the teacher, the professional man—all need 
imagination in their vocations not less than the writers 
need it in theirs, but each needs a specialized kind 
adapted to the particular work which he has to do. 
Practical Nature of Imagination.—Imagination is not 
a process of thought which must deal chiefly with un- 
realities and impossibilities, and which has for its chief 
end our amusement when we have nothing better to do 
than to follow its wanderings. It is, rather, a common- 
place, necessary process which illumines the way for our 
everyday thinking and acting—a process without which 
we think and act by haphazard chance or blind imita- 
tion. It is the process by which the images from our 
past experiences are marshaled, and made to serve our 
present. Imagination looks into the future and con- 
structs our patterns and lays our plans. It sets up our 
ideals and pictures us in the acts of achieving them. 
It enables us to live our joys and our sorrows, our vic- 
tories and our defeats before we reach them. It looks 
into the past and allows us to live with the kings and 
seers of old, or it goes back to the beginning and we see 
things in the process of the making. It comes into our 
present and plays a part in every act from the simplest 
to the most complex. It is to the mental stream what 
the light is to the traveler who carries it as he passes 
through the darkness, while it casts its beams in all di- 
rections around him, lighting up what otherwise would 
be intolerable gloom. 
Imagination in the Tatnbgbetetinas of History, Litera- 
ture, and Art.—Let us see some of the most common uses 
of the imagination. Suppose I describe to you the bat- 
tle of the Marne. Unless you can take the images which 
my words suggest and build them into struggling, shout- 
ing, bleeding soldiers; into forts and entanglements and 
 
-P-A-G-E-147
  IMAGINATION 129 
breastworks; into roaring canzon and whistling bullet 
and screaming shell—unless you can take all these sep- 
arate images and out of them get one great unified com- 
plex, then my description will be to you only so many 
words largely without content, and you will lack the 
power to comprehend the historical event in any com- 
plete way. Unless you can read the poem, and out of 
the images suggested by the words reconstruct the pic- 
ture which was in the mind of the author as he wrote 
“The Village Blacksmith’? or ‘‘Snowbound,’’ the sig- 
nificance will have dropped out, and the throbbing scenes 
of life and action become only so many dead words, 
like the shell of the chrysalis after the butterfly has left 
its shroud. Without the power of imagination, the his- 
tory of Washington’s winter at Valley Forge becomes a 
mere formal recital, and you can never get a view of 
the snow-covered tents, the wind-swept landscape, the 
tracks in the snow marked by the telltale drops of blood, 
or the form of the heartbroken commander as he kneels 
in the silent wood to pray for his army. Without the 
power to construct this picture as you read, you may 
commit the words, and be able to recite them, and to 
pass examination upon them, but the living reality of it 
will forever escape you. 
Your power of imagination determines your ability to 
interpet literature of all kinds; for the interpretation of 
literature is nothing, after all, but the reconstruction on 
our part of the pictures with their meanings which were 
in the mind of the writer as he penned the words, and 
the experiencing of the emotions which moved him as 
he wrote. Small use indeed to read the history of the 
centuries unless we can see in it living, acting people, 
and real events occurring in actual environments. Small 
_use to read the world’s great books unless their char-
-P-A-G-E-148
  130 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
acters are to us real men and women—our brothers and 
sisters, interpreted to us by the master minds of the 
ages. Anything less than this, and we are no longer 
dealing with literature, but with words—like musical 
sounds which deal with no theme, or like picture frames 
in which no picture has been set. Nor is the case differ- 
ent in listening to a speaker. His words are to you only 
so many sensations of sounds of such and such pitches 
and intensities and quality, unless your mind keeps pace 
with his and continually builds the pictures which fill 
his thought as he speaks. Lacking imagination, the 
sculptures of Michael Angelo and the pictures of Raphael 
are to you so many pieces of curiously shaped marble 
and ingeniously colored canvas. What the sculptor and 
the painter have placed before you must suggest to you 
images and thoughts from your own experience, to fill 
out and make alive the marble and the canvas, else to 
you they are dead. 
Imagination and Science.—Nor is imagination less nec- 
essary in other lines of study. Without this power of 
building living, moving pictures out of images, there is 
small use to study science beyond what is immediately 
present to our senses; for some of the most fundamental 
laws of science rest upon conceptions which ean be 
grasped only as we have the power of imagination. The 
student who cannot get a picture of the molecules of 
matter, infinitely close to each other and yet never touch- 
ing, all in vibratory motion, yet each within its own or- 
bit, each a complete unit in itself, yet capable of still 
further division into smaller particles,—the student who 
cannot see all this in a clear visual image can never at 
best have more than a most hazy notion of the theory of 
matter. And this means, finally, that the explanations 
of light and heat and sound, and much besides, will be
-P-A-G-E-149
IMAGINATION 131 
to him largely a jumble of words which linger in his 
memory, perchance, but which never vitally become a 
possession of his mind. 
So with the world of the telescope. You may have at 
your disposal all the magnificent lenses and the accurate 
machinery owned by modern observatories; but if you 
have not within yourself the power to build what these 
reveal to you, and what the books tell you, into the solar 
system and still larger systems, you can never study 
astronomy except in a blind and piecemeal sort of way, 
and all the planets and satellites and suns will never 
for you form themselves into a system, no matter what 
the books may say about it. 
Everyday Uses of Imagination.—But we may consider 
a still more practical phase of imagination, or at least 
one which has more to do with the humdrum daily life 
of most of us. Suppose you go to your milliner and tell 
her how you want your spring hat shaped and trimmed. 
And suppose you have never been able to see this hat 
in toto in your mind, so as to get an idea of how it will 
look when completed, but have only a general notion, 
because you like red velvet, white plumes, and a turned- 
up rim, that this combination will look well together. 
Suppose you have never been able to see how you would 
look in this particular hat with your hair done in this 
or that way. If you are in this helpless state shall you 
not have to depend finally on the taste of the milliner, 
or accept the ‘‘model,’’ and so fail to reveal any taste or 
individuality on your own part? 
How many times have you been disappointed in some 
article of dress, because when you planned it you were 
unable to see it all at once so as to get the full effect; 
or else you could not see yourself in it, and so be able 
to judge whether it suited you! How many homes have
-P-A-G-E-150
  132 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
in them draperies and rugs and wall paper and furni- 
ture which are in constant quarrel because someone 
could not see before they were assembled that they were 
never intended to keep company! How many people who 
plan their own houses, would build them just the same 
again after seeing them completed? The man who can 
see a building complete before a brick has been laid 
or a timber put in place, who can see it not only in its 
details one by one as he runs’them over in his mind, but_ 
ean see the building in its entirety, is the only one who 
is safe to plan the structure. And this is the man who 
is drawing a large salary as an architect, for imagina- 
tions of this kind are in demand. Only the one who can 
see in his ‘‘mind’s eye,’’ before it is begun, the thing 
he would create, is capable to plan its construction. And 
who will say that ability to work with images of these 
kinds is not of just as high a type as that which results 
in the construction of plots upon which stories are built! 
The Building of Ideals and Plans.—Nor is the part of 
imagination less marked in the formation of our 
life’s ideals and plans. Everyone who is not living 
blindly and aimlessly must have some ideal, some pat- 
tern, by which to square his life and guide his actions. 
At some time in our life I am sure that each of us has 
selected the person who filled most nearly our notion of 
what we should like to become, and measured ourselves 
by this pattern. But there comes a time when we must 
idealize even the most perfect individual; when we in- 
vest the character with attributes which we have selected 
from some other person, and thus worship at a shrine 
which is partly real and partly ideal. 
As time goes on, we drop out more and more of the 
strictly individual element, adding correspondingly 
more of the ideal, until our pattern is largely a con-
-P-A-G-E-151
IMAGINATION 133 
struction of our own imagination, having in it the best 
we have been able to glean from the many characters 
we have known. How large a part these ever-changing 
ideals play in our lives we shall never know, but cer- 
tainly the part is not an insignificant one. And happy 
the youth who is able to look into the future and see 
himself approximating some worthy ideal. He has 
caught a vision which will never allow him to lag or fal- 
ter in the pursuit of the flying goal which points the 
direction of his efforts. 
Imagination and Conduct.—Another great field for 
imagination is with reference to conduct and our rela- 
tions with others. Over and over again the thoughtless 
person has to say, ‘‘I am sorry; I did not think.’’ The 
“‘did not think’’ simply means that he failed to realize 
through his imagination what would be the consequences 
of his rash or unkind words. He would not be unkind, 
but he did not imagine how the other would feel; he 
did not put himself in the other’s place. Likewise with 
reference to the effects of our conduct on ourselves. 
What youth, taking his first drink of liquor, would con- 
tinue if he could see a clear picture of himself in the 
gutter with bloated face and bloodshot eyes a decade 
hence? Or what boy, slyly smoking one of his early 
cigarettes, would proceed. if he could see his haggard 
face and nerveless hand a few years farther along? 
What spendthrift would throw away his money on vani- 
ties could he vividly see himself in penury and want in 
old age? What prodigal anywhere who, if he could 
take a good look at himself sin-stained and broken as he 
returns to his ‘‘father’s house’’ after the years of de- 
bauchery in the ‘‘far country’’ would not hesitate long 
before he entered upon his downward career? 
Imagination and Thinking.—We have already consid-
-P-A-G-E-152
134 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
ered the use of imagination in interpreting the thoughts, 
feelings and handiwork of others, Let us now look a 
little more closely into the part it plays in our own 
thinking. Suppose that, instead of reading a poem, 
we are writing one; instead of listening to a deserip- 
tion of a battle, we are describing it; instead of look- 
ing at the picture, we are painting it. Then our object 
is to make others who may read our language, or listen 
to our words, or view our handiwork, construct the 
mental images of the situation which furnished the 
material for our thought. 
Our words and other modes of expression are but the 
description of the flow of images in our minds, and our 
problem is to make\a similar stream flow through the 
mind of the listener; but strange indeed would it be to 
make others see a situation which we ourselves cannot 
see; strange if we could draw a picture without being 
able to follow its outlines as we draw. Or suppose we 
are teaching science, and our object is to explain the 
composition of matter to someone, and make him under- 
stand how light, heat, ete., depend on the theory of mat- 
ter; strange if the listener should get a picture if we 
ourselves are unable to get it. Or, once more, suppose we 
are to describe some incident, and our aim is to make 
its every detail stand out so clearly that no one can 
miss a single one. Is it not evident that we can never 
make any of these images more clear to those who listen 
to us or read our words than they are to ourselves? 
2. THE MATERIAL USED BY IMAGINATION 
What is the material, the mental content, out of which 
imagination builds its structures? 
Images the Stuff of Imagination.—Nothing can enter
-P-A-G-E-153
  IMAGINATION 135 
the imagination the elements of which have not been 
in our past experience and then been conserved in the 
form of images. The Indians never dreamed of a heaven 
whose streets are paved with gold, and in whose center 
stands a great white throne. Their experience had given 
them no knowledge of these things; and so, perforce, 
they must build their heaven out of the images which 
they had at command, namely, those connected with the 
chase and the forest. So their heaven was the ‘‘happy 
hunting ground,’’ inhabited by game and enemies over 
whom the blessed forever triumphed. Likewise the val- 
iant soldiers whose deadly arrows and keen-edged swords 
and battle-axes won on the bloody field of Hastings, did 
not picture a far-off day when the opposing lines should 
kill each other with mighty engines hurling death from 
behind parapets a dozen miles away. Firearms and 
the explosive powder were yet unknown, hence there 
were no images out of which to build such a picture. 
I do not mean that your imagination cannot construct 
an object which has never before been in your experience 
as a whole, for the work of the imagination is to do 
precisely this thing. It takes the various images at its 
disposal and builds them into wholes which may never 
have existed before, and which may exist now only as a 
ereation of the mind. And yet we have put into this 
new product not a single element which was not familiar 
to us in the form of an image of one kind or another. 
It is the form which is new; the material is old. This 
is exemplified every time an inventor takes the two fun- 
damental parts of a machine, the lever and the inclined 
plane, and puts them together in relations new to each 
other and so evolves a machine whose complexity fairly 
bewilders us. And with other lines of thinking, as in 
mechanics, inventive power consists in being able to see
-P-A-G-E-154
  136 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
the old in new relations, and so constantly build new 
constructions out of old material. It is this power which 
gives us the daring and original thinker, the Newton 
whose falling apple suggested to him the planets falling 
toward the sun in their orbits; the Darwin who out of 
the thigh bone of an animal was able to construct in his 
imagination the whole animal and the environment in 
which it must have lived, and so add another page to the 
earth’s history. 
The Two Factors in Imagination.—From the simple 
facts which we have just been considering, the conclusion 
is plain that our power of imagination depends on two 
factors; namely, (1) the materials available in the form 
of usable images capable of recall, and (2) our construc- 
tive ability, or the power to group these images into new 
wholes, the process being guided by some purpose or end. 
Without this last provision, the products of our imagina- 
tion are daydreams with their ‘‘castles in Spain,’’ which 
may be pleasing and proper enough on occasions, but 
which as an habitual mode of thought are extremely dan- 
gerous. 
Imagination Limited by Stock of Images.—That the 
mind is limited in its imagination by its stock of images 
may be seen from a simple illustration: Suppose that 
you own a building made of brick, but that you find the 
old one no longer adequate for your needs, and so pur- 
pose to build a new one; and suppose, further, that you 
have no material for your new building except that 
contained in the old structure. It is evident that you 
will be limited in constructing your new building by 
the material which was in the old. You may be able 
to build the new structure in any one of a multitude of 
different forms or styles of architecture, so far as the 
material at hand will lend itself to that style of build-  
-P-A-G-E-155
IMAGINATION 137 
ing, and providing, further, that you are able to make 
the plans. But you will always be limited finally by the 
character and amount of material obtainable from the 
old structure. So with the mind. The old building is 
your past experience, and the separate bricks are the im- 
ages out of which you must build your new structure 
through the imagination. Here, as before, nothing can 
enter which was not already on hand. Nothing goes into 
the new structure so far as its constructive material is 
concerned except images, and there is nowhere to get 
images but from the results of our past experience. 
Limited Also by Our Constructive Ability—But not 
only is our imaginative output limited by the amount of 
material in the way of images which we have at our 
command, but also and perhaps not less by our construc- 
tive ability. Many persons might own the old pile of 
bricks fully adequate for the new structure, and then 
fail to get the new because they were unable to construct 
it. So, many who have had a rich and varied experi- 
ence in many lines are yet unable to muster their images 
of these experiences in such a way that new products 
are obtainable from them. These have the heavy, draft- 
horse kind of intellect which goes plodding on, very pos- 
sibly doing good service in its own circumscribed range, 
but destined after all to service in the narrow field with 
its low, drooping horizon. They are never able to take 
a dash at a two-minute clip among equally swift com- 
petitors, or even swing at a good round pace along the 
pleasant highways of an experience lying beyond the 
confines of the narrow here and now. These are the 
minds which cannot discover relations; which cannot 
think. Minds of this type can never be architects of 
their own fate, or even builders, but must content them- 
selves to be hod carriers. 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
  138 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
The Need of a Purpose.—Nor are we to forget that we 
cannot intelligently erect our building until we know the 
purpose for which it is to be used. No matter how much 
building material we may have on hand, nor how skillful 
an architect we may be, unless our plans are guided by 
some definite aim, we shall be likely to end with a struc- 
ture that is fanciful and useless. Likewise with our 
thought structure. Unless our imagination is guided by 
some aim or purpose, we are in danger of drifting into 
mere daydreams which not only are useless in furnish- 
ing ideals for the guidance of our lives, but often be- 
come positively harmful when grown into a habit. The 
habit of daydreaming is hard to break, and, continuing, 
holds our thought in thrall and makes it unwilling to 
deal with the plain, homely things of everyday life. Who 
has not had the experience of an hour or a day spent 
in a fairyland of dreams, and awakened at the end to 
find himself rather dissatisfied with the prosaic round of 
duties which confronted him! I do not mean to say 
that we should never dream; but I know of no more per- 
nicious mental habit than that of daydreaming carried 
to excess, for it ends in our following every will-o’-the- 
wisp of fancy, and places us at the mercy of every chance 
suggestion. 
3. TYPES OF IMAGINATION 
Although imagination enters every field of human ex- 
perience, and busies itself with every line of human 
interest, yet all its activities can be classed under two 
different types. These are (1) reproductive, and (2) 
creative imagination. 
Reproductive ImaginationReproductive imagination. 
is the type we use when we seek to reproduce in our 
minds the pictures described by others, or pictures from 
 
-P-A-G-E-157
IMAGINATION 139 
our own past experience which lack the completeness 
and fidelity to make them true memory. 
The narration or description of the story book, the 
history or geography text; the tale of adventure re- 
counted by traveler or hunter; the account of a new 
machine or other invention; fairy tales and myths— 
these or any other matter that may be put into words 
capable of suggesting images to us are the field for re- 
productive imagination. In this use of the imagination 
our business is to follow and not lead, to copy and not 
create. 
Creative Imagination—But we must have leaders, 
originators—else we should but imitate each other and 
the world would be at a standstill. Indeed, every per- 
son, no matter how humble his station or how humdrum 
his life, should be in some degree capable of initiative 
and originality. Such ability depends in no small meas- 
ure on the power to use creative imagination. 
Creative imagination takes the images from our own 
past experience or those gleaned from the work of others 
and puts them together in new and original forms. The 
inventor, the writer, the mechanic or the artist who 
possesses the spirit of creation is not satisfied with mere 
reproduction, but seeks to modify, to improve, to origi- 
nate. True, many important inventions and discoveries 
have come by seeming accident, by being stumbled upon. 
Yet it holds that the person who thus stumbles upon 
the discovery or invention is usually one whose creative 
imagination is actively at work seeking to create or dis- 
cover in his field. The world’s progress as a whole 
does not come by accident, but by creative planning. 
Creative imagination is always found at the van of prog- 
ress, whether in the life of an individual or a nation. 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
  140 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
4, TRAINING THE IMAGINATION 
Imagination is highly susceptible of cultivation, and 
its training should constitute one of the most important 
aims of education. Every school subject, but especially 
such subjects as deal with description and narration— 
history, literature, geography, nature study and science 
—is rich in opportunities for the use of imagination. 
Skillful teaching will not only find in these subjects a 
means of training the imagination, but will so employ 
imagination in their study as to make them living mat- 
ter, throbbing with life and action, rather than so many 
dead words or uninteresting facts. 
Gathering of Material for Imagination.—Theoretically, 
then, it is not hard to see what we must do to cultivate 
our imagination. In the first place, we must take care 
to secure a large and usable stock of images from ali 
fields of perception. It is not enough to have visual im- 
ages alone or chiefly, for many a time shall we need 
to build structures involving all the other senses and 
the motor activities as well. This means that we must 
have a first-hand contact with just as large an environ- 
ment as possible—large in the world of Nature with all 
her varied forms suited to appeal to every avenue of 
sense; large in our contact with people in all phases 
of experience, laughing with those who laugh and weep- 
ing with those who weep; large in contact with books, 
the interpreters of the men and events of the past. We 
must not only let all these kinds of environment drift 
in upon us as they may chance to do, but we must de- 
liberately seek to increase our stock of experience; for, 
after all, experience lies at the bottom of imagination 
as of every other mental process. And not only must 
we thus put ourselves in the way of acquiring new ex-
-P-A-G-E-159
      IMAGINATION 141 
  perience, but we must by recall and reconstruction, as 
we saw in an earlier discussion, keep our imagery fresh 
and usable. For whatever serves to improve our images, 
at the same time is bettering the very foundation of im- 
agination. 
We Must Not Fail to Build—In the second place, we 
must not fail to build. For it is futile to gather a large 
supply of images if we let the material lie unused. How 
many people there are who put in all their time gather- 
ing material for their structure, and never take time 
to do the building! They look and listen and read, and 
are so fully occupied in absorbing the immediately pres- 
ent that they have no time to see the wider significance 
of the things with which they deal. They are like the 
students who are too busy studying to have time to 
think. They are so taken up with receiving that they 
never perform the higher act of combining. They are 
the plodding fact gatherers, many of them doing good 
service, collecting material which the seer and the phi- 
losopher, with their constructive power, build together 
into the greater wholes which make our systems of 
thought. They are the ones who fondly think that, by 
reading books full of wild tales and impossible plots, they 
are training their imagination. For them, sober history, 
no matter how heroic or tragic in its quiet movements, is 
too tame. They have not the patience to read solid and 
thoughtful literature, and works of science and philos- 
ophy are a bore. These are the persons who put in all 
their time in looking at and admiring other people’s 
houses, and never get time to do any building for them- 
selves. : 
We Should Carry Our Ideals into Action—The best 
training for the imagination which I know anything 
about is that to be obtained by taking our own material   
-P-A-G-E-160
142 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
  and from it building our own structure. It is true that 
it will help to look through other people’s houses enough 
to discover their style of building: we should read. But 
just as it is not necessary for us to put in all the time 
we devote to looking at houses, in inspecting doll houses 
and Chinese pagodas, so it is not best for us to get all 
our notions of imaginative structures from the marvelous 
and the unreal; we get good training for the imagina- 
tion from reading ‘‘ Hiawatha,’’ but so can we from read- 
ing the history of the primitive Indian tribes. The pic- 
tures in ‘‘Snowbound”’ are full of suggestion for the 
imagination: but so is the history of the Puritans in 
New England. But even with the best of models be- 
fore us, it is not enough to follow others’ building. We 
must construct stories for ourselves, must work out plots 
for our own stories; we must have time to meditate and 
plan and build, not idly in the daydream, but purpose- 
fully, and then make our images real by carrying them 
out in activity, if they are of such a character that this 
is possible; we must build our ideals and work to them 
in the common course of our everyday life; we must 
think for ourselves instead of forever following the 
thinking of others; we must initiate as well as imitate. 
5. PROBLEMS FOR OBSERVATION AND INTROSPECTION 
1. Explain the cause and the remedy in the case of such 
errors as the following: 
Children who defined mountain as land 1,000 or more feet 
in height said that the factory smokestack was higher than 
the mountain because it “went straight up” and the moun- 
tain did not. 
Children often think of the horizon as fastened to the 
earth. 
Islands are thought of as floating on the water.
-P-A-G-E-161
  IMAGINATION 143 
2. How would you stimulate the imagination of a child who 
does not seem to picture or make real the descriptions in read- 
ing, geography, ete.? Is it possible that such inability may 
eome from an insufficient basis in observation, and hence in 
images? 
3. Classify the school subjects, including domestic science 
and manual training, as to their ability to train (1) repro- 
ductive and (2) creative imagination. 
4. Do you ever skip the descriptive parts of a book and 
read the narrative? As you read the description of a bit of 
natural scenery, does it rise before you? As you study the 
description of a battle, can you see the movements of the 
troops? 
5. Have you ever planned a house as you think you would 
like it? Can you see it from all sides? Can you see all the 
rooms in their various finishings and furnishings? 
6. What plans and ideals have you formed, and what ones 
are you at present following? Can you describe the process 
by which your plans or ideals change? Do you ever try to 
put yourself in the other person’s place? 
7. Take some fanciful unreality which your imagination has 
constructed and see whether you can select from it familiar 
elements from actual experiences. 
8. What use do you make of imagination in the common 
round of duties in your daily life? What are you doing to 
improve your imagination?
-P-A-G-E-162
  CHAPTER X 
ASSOCIATION 
WHENCE came the thought that occupies you this mo- 
ment, and what determines the next that is to follow? 
Introspection reveals no more interesting fact concern- 
ing our minds than that our thoughts move in a con- 
nected and orderly array and not in a hit-and-miss fash- 
ion. Our mental states do not throng the stream of 
consciousness like so many pieces of wood following each 
other at random down a rushing current, now this one 
ahead, now that. On the contrary, our thoughts come, 
one after the other, as they are beckoned or caused. The 
thought now in the focal point of your consciousness 
appeared because it sprouted out of the one just pre- 
ceding it; and the present thought, before it departs, 
will determine its successor and lead it upon the scene. 
This is to say that our thought stream possesses not 
only a continuity, but also a wnity; it has coherence and 
system. This coherence and system, which operates in 
accordance with definite laws, is brought about by what 
the psychologist calls association. 
1. THE NATURE OF ASSOCIATION 
We may define association, then, as the tendency 
among our thoughts to form such a system of bonds 
with each other that the objects of consciousness are 
vitally connected both (1) as they exist at any given mo- 
144
-P-A-G-E-163
    ASSOCIATION 145 
ment, and (2) as they occur in succession in the mental 
stream. 
The Neural Basis of Association.—The association of 
thoughts—ideas, images, memory—or of a situation with 
its response, rests primarily on a neural basis. Asso- 
ciation is the result of habit working in neurone groups. 
Its fundamental law is stated by James as follows: 
“When two elementary brain-processes have been ac- 
tive together or in immediate succession, one of them, 
on recurring, tends to propagate its excitement into the 
other.’’ This is but a technical statement of the simple 
fact that nerve currents flow most easily over the neu- 
rone connections that they have already used. 
It is hard to teach an old dog new tricks, because 
the old tricks employ familiar, much-used neural paths, 
while new tricks require the connecting up of groups of 
neurones not in the habit of working together; and the 
flow of nerve energy is more easily accomplished in 
the neurones accustomed to working together. One 
who learns to speak a foreign language late in life never 
attains the facility and ease that might have been 
reached at an earlier age. This is because the neural 
paths for speech are already set for his mother-tongue, 
and, with the lessened plasticity of age, the new paths 
are hard to establish. 
The connections between the various brain areas, or 
groups of neurones, are, as we have seen in an earlier 
chapter, accomplished by means of association fibers. 
This function requires millions of neurones, which unite 
every part of the cortex with every other part, thus 
making it possible for a neural activity going on in any 
particular center to extend to any other center whatso- 
ever. In the relatively unripe brain of the child, the 
association fibers have not yet set up most of their con-
-P-A-G-E-164
  146 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
nections. The age at which memory begins is determined 
chiefly by the development of a sufficient number of as- 
sociation fibers to bring about recall. The more complex 
reasoning, which requires many different associative 
connections, is impossible prior to the existence of 
adequate neural development. It is this fact that makes 
it futile to attempt to teach young children the more 
complicated processes of arithmetic, grammar, or other 
  Fic. 18.—Diagrammatic scheme of association, in which V stands for 
the visual, A for the auditory, G for the gustatory, M for the motor, 
and T for the thought and feeling centers of the cortex. 
subjects. They are not yet equipped with the requisite | 
brain machinery to grasp the necessary associations. 
Association the Basis of Memory.—Without the ma- 
chinery and processes of association we could have no 
memory. Let us see in a simple illustration how associa- 
tion works in recall. Suppose you are passing an or- 
chard and see a tree loaded with tempting apples. You 
hesitate, then climb the fence, pick an apple and eat 
it, hearing the owner’s dog bark as you leave the place. 
The accompanying diagram will illustrate roughly the 
centers of the cortex which were involved in the act, 
and the association fibers which connect them. (See Fig.
-P-A-G-E-165
  ASSOCIATION 147 
18.) Now let us see how you may afterward remember 
the circumstance through association. Let us suppose 
that a week later you are seated at your dining table, 
and that you begin to eat an apple whose flavor reminds 
you of the one which you plucked from the tree. From 
this start how may the entire circumstance be recalled? 
Remember that the cortical centers connected with 
the sight of the apple tree, with our thoughts about it, 
with our movements in getting the apple, and with hear- 
ing the dog bark, were all active together with the taste 
center, and hence tend to be thrown into activity again 
from its activity. It is easy to see that we may (1) get 
a visual image of the apple tree and its fruit from a 
current over the gustatory-visual association fibers; (2) 
the thoughts, emotions, or deliberations which we had on 
the former occasion may again recur to us from a cur- 
rent over the gustatory-thought neurones; (3) we may 
get an image of our movements in climbing the fence 
and picking the apple from a current over the gusta- 
tory-motor fibers; or (4) we may get an auditory image 
of the barking of the dog from a current over the gus- 
tatory-auditory fibers. Indeed, we are sure to get some 
one or more of these unless the paths are blocked in 
some way, or our attention leads off in some other di- 
rection. 
Factors Determining Direction of Recall.— Which of 
these we get first, which of the images the taste per- 
cept calls to take its place as it drops out of con- 
sciousness, will depend, other things being equal, on 
which center was most keenly active in the original situa- 
tion, and is at the moment most permeable. If, at the 
time we were eating the stolen fruit, our thoughts were 
keenly self-accusing for taking the apples without per- 
mission, then the current will probably discharge
-P-A-G-E-166
  148 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
through the path gustatory-thought, and we shall re- 
eall these thoughts and their accompanying feelings. 
But if it chances that the barking of the dog frightened 
us badly, then more likely the discharge from the taste 
center will be along the path gustatory-auditory, and 
we shall get the auditory image of the dog’s barking, 
which in turn may call up a visual image of his savage 
appearance over the auditory-visual fibers. It is clear, 
however, that, given any one of the elements of the en- 
tire situation back, the rest are potentially possible to 
us, and any one may serve as a ‘‘cue”’ to call up all the 
rest. Whether, given the starting point, we get them 
all, depends solely on whether the paths are sufficiently 
open between them for the current to discharge between 
them, granting that the first experience made sufficient 
impression to be retained. : 
Since this simple illustration may be made infinitely 
eomplex by means of the millions of fibers which con- 
nect every center in the cortex with every other center, 
and since, in passing from one experience to another in 
the round of our daily activities, these various areas are 
all involved in an endless chain of activities so inti- 
mately related that each one can finally lead to all the 
others, we have here the machinery both of retention 
and of recall—the mechanism by which our past may be 
made to serve the present through being reproduced in 
the form of memory images or ideas. Through this ma- 
chinery we are unable to escape our past, whether it be 
good or bad; for both the good and the bad alike are 
brought back to us through its operations. 
When the repetition of a series of acts has rendered 
habit secure, the association is relatively certain. If I 
recite to you A-B-C-D, your thought at once runs on to 
E, F, G. If I repeat, ‘‘Tell me not in mournful num-
-P-A-G-E-167
  
ASSOCIATION 149 
bers,’’ association leads you to follow with ‘‘Life is but 
an empty dream.’’ Your neurone groups are accus- 
tomed to act in this way, so the sequence follows. Mem- 
orizing anything from the multiplication table to the 
most beautiful gems of poetic fervor consists, therefore, 
in the setting up of the right associative connections in 
the brain. 
Association in Thinking—All thinking proceeds by 
the discovery or recognition of relations between the 
terms or objects of our thought. The science of mathe- 
matics rests on the relations found to exist between num- 
bers and quantities. The principles and laws of nat- 
ural science are based on the relations established among 
the different forms of matter and the energy that op- 
erates in this field. So also in the realm of history, art, 
ethics, or any other field of human experience. Each 
fact or event must be linked to other facts or events be- 
fore it possesses significance. Association therefore lies 
at the foundation of all thinking, whether that of the 
original thinker who is creating our sciences, planning 
and executing the events of history, evolving a system 
of ethics, or whether one is only learning these fields 
as they already exist by means of study. Other things 
being equal, he is the best thinker who has his knowledge 
related part to part so that the whole forms a unified 
and usable system. 
Association and Action.—Association plays an equally 
important part in all our motor responses, the acts by - 
which we carry on our daily lives, do our work and our 
play, or whatever else may be necessary in meeting 
and adapting ourselves to our environment. Some sen- 
sations are often repeated, and demand practically the 
same response each time. In such cases the associa- 
tions soon become fixed, and the response certain and
-P-A-G-E-168
  150 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
automatic. For example, we sit at the table, and 
the response of eating follows, with all its complex 
acts, as a matter of ‘course. We lie down in bed, 
and the response of sleep comes. We take our place 
at the piano, and our fingers produce the accustomed 
music. 
It is of course obvious that the influence of associa- 
tion extends to moral action as well. In general, our 
conduct follows the trend of established associations. 
We are likely to do in great moral crises about as we 
are in the habit of doing in small ones. 
2. THE TYPES OF ASSOCIATION 
Fundamental Law of Association.—Stated on the phys- 
iological side, the law of habit as set forth in the defi- 
nition of association in the preceding section includes 
all the laws of association. In different phrasing we 
may say: (1) Neurone groups accustomed to acting to- 
gether have the tendency to work in unison. (2) The 
more frequently such groups act together the stronger 
will be the tendency for one to throw the other into 
action. Also, (3) the more intense the excitement or ten- 
sion under which they act together the stronger will 
be the tendency for activity in one to bring about ac- 
tivity in the other. 
The corresponding facts may be expressed in psy- 
chological terms as follows: (1) Facts accustomed to 
being associated together in the mind have a tendency 
to reappear together. (2) The more frequently these 
facts appear together the stronger the tendency for the 
presence of one to insure the presence of the other. 
(3) The greater the tension, excitement or concentra- 
tion when these facts appear in conjunction with each
-P-A-G-E-169
  ASSOCIATION 151 
other, the more certain the presence of one is to cause 
the presence of the other. 
Several different types of association have been dif- 
ferentiated by psychologists from Aristotle down. It 
is to be kept in mind, however, that all association types 
go back to the elementary law of habit-connections 
among the neurones for their explanation. 
Association by Contiguity.—The recurrence in our 
minds of many of the elements from our past experience 
is due to the fact that at some time, possibly at many 
times, the recurring facts were contiguous in conscious- 
ness with some other element or fact which happens now 
to be again present. All have had the experience of 
meeting some person whom we had not seen for several 
months or years, and having a whole series of supposedly 
forgotten incidents or events connected with our former 
associations flood into the mind. Things we did, topics 
we discussed, trips we took, games we played, now recur 
at the renewal of our acquaintance. For these are the 
things that were contiguous in our consciousness with 
our sense of the personality and appearance of our 
friend. And who has not in similar fashion had a whiff 
of perfume or the strains of a song recall to him his 
childhood days! Contiguity is again the explanation. 
At the Mercy of Our Associations——Through the law 
thus operating we are in a sense at the mercy of our 
associations, which may be bad as well as good. We 
may form certain lines of interest to guide our thought, 
and attention may in some degree direct it, but one’s 
mental make-up is, after all, largely dependent on the 
character of his associations. Evil thoughts, evil mem- 
ories, evil imaginations—these all come about through 
the association of unworthy or impure images along 
with the good in our stream of thought. We may try
-P-A-G-E-170
  152 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
to forget the base deed and banish it forever from our 
thinking, but lo! in an unguarded moment the nerve 
current shoots into the old path, and the impure thought 
flashes into the mind, unsought and unwelcomed. Every 
young man who thinks he must indulge in a little sowing 
of wild oats before he settles down to a correct life, 
and so deals in unworthy thoughts and deeds, is put- 
ting a mortgage on his future; for he will find the in- 
exorable machinery of his nervous system grinding the 
hated images of such things back into his mind as 
surely as the mill returns to the sack of the miller 
what he feeds into the hopper. He may refuse to har- 
bor these thoughts, but he can no more hinder their 
seeking admission to his mind than he can prevent the 
tramp from knocking at his door. He may drive such 
images from his mind the moment they are discovered, 
and indeed is guilty if he does not; but not taking of- 
fense at this rebuff, the unwelcome thought again seeks 
admission. 
The only protection against the return of the unde- 
sirable associations is to choose lines of thought as 
little related to them as possible. But even then, do 
the best we may, an occasional ‘‘connection’’ will be 
set up, we know not how, and the unwelcome image 
stands staring us in the face, as the corpse of Eugene 
Aram’s victim confronted him at every turn, though he 
thought it safely buried. A minister of my acquaintance 
tells me that in the holiest moments of his most exalted 
thought, images rise in his mind which he loathes, and 
from which he recoils in horror. Not only does he drive 
them away at once, but he seeks to lock and bar the door 
against them by firmly resolving that he will never think 
of them again. But alas! that is beyond his control. 
The tares have been sown among the wheat, and will per- 
 
-P-A-G-E-171
  ASSOCIATION 153 
sist along with it until the end. In his boyhood these 
images were given into the keeping of his brain cells, and 
they are only being faithful to their trust. 
Association by Similarity and Contrast.—All are famil- 
iar’ with the fact that like tends to suggest like. One 
friend reminds us of another friend when he manifests 
similar traits of character, shows the same tricks of man- 
ner, or has the same peculiarities of speech or gesture. 
The telling of a ghost or burglar story in a company will 
at once suggest a similar story to every person of the 
group, and before we know it the conversation has set- 
tled down to ghosts or burglars. One boastful boy is 
enough to start the gang to recounting their real or 
imaginary exploits. Good and beautiful thoughts tend 
to call up other good and beautiful thoughts, while evil 
thoughts are likely to produce after their own kind; like 
produces like. 
Another form of relationship is, however, quite as 
common as similars in our thinking. In certain direc- 
tions we naturally think in opposites. Black suggests 
white, good suggests bad, fat suggests lean, wealth sug- 
gests poverty, happiness suggests sorrow, and so on. 
The tendency of our thought thus to group in sim- 
ilars and opposites is clear when we go back to the fun- 
damental law of association. The fact is that we more 
frequently assemble our thoughts in these ways than in 
haphazard relations. We habitually group similars to- 
gether, or compare opposites in our thinking ; hence these 
are the terms between which associative bonds are 
formed. 
Partial, or Selective, Association—The past is never 
wholly reinstated in present consciousness. Many ele- 
ments, because they had formed fewer associations, or 
because they find some obstacle to recall, are perma-
-P-A-G-E-172
154 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
  nently dropped out and forgotten. In other words, as- 
sociation is always selective, favoring now this item of 
experience, now that, above the rest. 
It is well that this is so; for to be unable to escape 
from the great mass of minutie and unimportant detail 
in one’s past would be intolerable, and would so cumber 
the mind with useless rubbish as to destroy its useful- 
ness. We have surely all had some experience with the 
type of persons whose associations are so complete and 
impartial that all their conversation teems with unes- 
sential and irrelevant details. They cannot recount the 
simplest incident in its essential points but, slaves to 
literalness, make themselves insufferable bores by enter- 
ing upon every lane and by-path of circumstance that 
leads nowhere and matters not the least in their story. 
Dickens, Thackeray, George Eliot, Shakespeare, and 
many other writers have seized upon such characters and 
made use of them for their comic effect. James, in illus- 
trating this mental type, has quoted the following from 
Miss Austen’s ‘‘Emma’’: 
“<*But where could you hear it?’ cried Miss Bates. 
“Where could you possibly hear it, Mr. Knightley? For 
it is not five minutes since I received Mrs. Cole’s note— 
no, it cannot be more than five—or at least ten—for I 
had got my bonnet and spencer on, just ready to come 
out—I was only gone down to speak to Patty again 
about the pork—Jane was standing in the passage— 
were not you, Jane?—for my mother was so afraid that 
we had not any salting-pan large enough. So I said I 
would go down and see, and Jane said: ‘‘Shall I go 
down instead? for I think you have a little cold, and 
Patty has been washing the kitchen.’’ ‘‘Oh, my dear,” 
said I—well, and just then came the note.’ ’’ 
The Remedy.—The remedy for such wearisome and
-P-A-G-E-173
ASSOCIATION 155 
fruitless methods of association is, as a matter of theory, 
simple and easy. It is to emphasize, intensify, and dwell 
upon the significant and essential in our thinking. The 
person who listens to a story, who studies a lesson, or 
who is a participant in any event must apply a sense of 
value, recognizing and fixing the important and rele- 
gating the trivial and unimportant to their proper level. 
Not to train one’s self to think in this discriminating 
way is much like learning to play a piano by striking 
each key with equal force! 
3. TRAINING IN ASSOCIATION 
Since association is at bottom nothing but habit at 
work in the mental processes, it follows that it, like other 
forms of habit, can be encouraged or suppressed by 
training. Certainly, no part of one’s education is of 
greater importance than the character of his associations. 
For upon these will largely depend not alone the content 
of his mental stream, the stuff of his thinking, but also 
its organization, or the use made of the thought material 
at hand. In fact, the whole science of education rests 
on the laws and principles involved in setting up right 
systems of associative connections in the individual. 
The Pleasure-Pain Motive in Association—A general 
law seems to obtain throughout the animal world that 
associative responses accompanied by pleasure tend to 
persist and grow stronger, while those accompanied by 
pain tend to weaken and fall away. The little child of 
two years may not understand the gravity of the offense 
in tearing the leaves out of books, but if its hands are 
sharply spatted whenever they tear a book, the associa- 
tion between the sight of books and tearing them will 
soon cease. “In fact, all punishment should have for its
-P-A-G-E-174
a a 
156 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
object the use of pain in the breaking of associative 
bonds between certain situations and wrong responses to 
them. 
On the other hand, the dog that is being trained to 
perform his tricks is rewarded with a tidbit or a pat 
when the right response has been made. In this way the 
bond for this particular act is strengthened through the 
use of pleasure. All matter studied and learned under 
the stimulus of good feeling, enthusiasm, or a pleasur- 
able sense of victory and achievement not only tends to 
set up more permanent and valuable associations than if 
learned under opposite conditions, but it also exerts a 
stronger appeal to our interest and appreciation. 
The influence of mental attitude on the matter we 
study raises a question as to the wisdom of assigning the 
committing of poetry, or Bible verses, or the reading 
of so many pages of a literary masterpiece as a punish- 
ment for some offense. How many of us have carried 
away associations of dislike and bitterness toward some 
gem of verse or prose or Scripture because of having our 
learning of it linked up with the thought of an imposed 
task set as penance for wrong-doing! One person tells 
me that to this day she hates the sight of Tennyson 
because this was the volume from which she was as- 
signed many pages to commit in atonement for her 
youthful delinquencies. 
Interest as a Basis for Association.—Associations estab- 
lished under the stimulus of strong interest are relatively 
broad and permanent, while those formed with in- 
terest flagging are more narrow and of doubtful per- 
manence. This statement is, of course, but a particular 
application of the law of attention. Interest brings the 
whole self into action. Under its urging the mind is 
active and alert. The new facts learned are completely
-P-A-G-E-175
ASSOCIATION 157 
  registered, and are assimilated to other facts to which 
they are related. Many associative connections are 
formed, hence the new matter is more certain of recall, 
and possesses more significance and meaning. 
Association and Methods of Learning—The number 
and quality of our associations depends in no small de- 
gree on our methods of learning. We may be satisfied 
merely to impress what we learn on our memory, com- 
mitting it uncritically as so many facts to be stored 
away as a part of our education. We may go a step be- 
yond this and grasp the simplest and most obvious mean- 
ings, but not seek for the deeper and more fundamental 
relations.. We may learn separate sections or divisions 
of a subject, accepting each as a more or less complete 
unit, without connecting these sections and divisions into 
a logical whole. 
But all such methods are a mistake. They do not pro- 
vide for the associative bonds between the various facts 
or groups of facts in our knowledge, without which 
our facts are in danger of becoming but so much lumber 
in the mind. Meanings, relations, definitely recognized 
associations, should attach to all that we learn. Better 
far a smaller amount of usable knowledge than any 
quantity of unorganized and undigested information, 
even if the latter sometimes allows us to pass examina- 
tions and receive honor grades. In short, real mastery 
demands that we think, that is relate and associate, in- 
stead of merely absorbing as we learn. 
4, PROBLEMS IN OBSERVATION AND INTROSPECTION 
1. Test the uncontrolled associations of a group of pupils 
by pronouncing to the class some word, as blue, and having 
the members write down 20 words in succession as rapidly as 
they ean, taking in each instance the first word that occurs
-P-A-G-E-176
158 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
  to them. The difference in the scope, or range, of associations, 
can easily be studied by applying this test to, say, a fourth 
grade and an eighth grade and then comparing results. 
2. Have you ever been puzzled by the appearance in 
your mind of some fact or incident not thought of before for 
years? Were you able to trace out the associative connection 
that caused the fact to appear? Why are we sometimes un- 
able to recall, when we need them, facts that we perfectly well 
know? 
3. You have observed that it is possible to be able to 
spell certain words when they occur in a spelling lesson, but 
to miss them when employing them in composition. It is 
possible to learn a conjugation or a declension in tabular form, 
and then not be able to use the correct forms of words in 
speech or writing. Relate these facts to the laws of associa- 
tion, and recommend a method of instruction that will remove 
the discrepancy. 
4. To test the quickness of association in a class of chil- 
dren, copy the following words clearly in a vertical column on 
a chart; have your class all ready at a given signal; then dis- 
play the chart before them for sixty seconds, asking them to 
write down on paper the exact opposite of as many words 
as possible in one minute. Be sure that all know just what 
they are expected to do. 
Bad, inside, slow, short, little, soft, black, dark, sad, true, 
dislike, poor, well, sorry, thick, full, peace, few, below, 
enemy. 
Count the number of correct opposites got by each pupil. 
5. Can you think of garrulous persons among your ac- 
quaintance the explanation of whose tiresomeness is that their 
association is of the complete instead of the selective type? 
Watch for such illustrations in conversation and in literature 
(e.g., Juliet’s nurse). 
6. Observe. children in the schoolroom for good and poor 
training in association. Have you ever had anything that 
you otherwise presumably would enjoy rendered distasteful
-P-A-G-E-177
  ASSOCIATION 159 
because of unpleasant associations? Pass your own methods 
of learning in review, and also inquire into the methods used 
by children in study, to determine whether they are resulting 
in the best possible use of association.

  CHAPTER XI 
MEMORY 
Every hour of our lives we call upon memory to sup- 
ply us with some fact or detail from out our past. Let, 
memory wholly fail us, and we find ourselves helpless 
and out of joint in a world we fail to understand. A 
poor memory handicaps one in the pursuit of education, 
hampers him in business or professional success, and 
puts him at a disadvantage in every relation of life. 
On the other hand, a good memory is an asset on which 
the owner realizes anew each succeeding day. 
1. THE NATURE OF MEMORY 
Now that you come to think of it, you can recall per- 
fectly well that Columbus discovered America in 1492; 
that your house is painted white; that it rained a week 
ago today. But where were these once-known facts, now 
remembered so easily, while they were out of your mind? 
Where did they stay while you were not thinking of 
them? The common answer is, ‘‘Stored away in my 
memory.’’ Yet no one believes that the memory is a 
warehouse of facts which we pack away there when we 
for a time have no use for them, as we store away our old 
furniture. 
What is Retained.—The truth is that the simple ques- 
tion I asked you is by no means an easy one, and I will 
160
-P-A-G-E-179
  MEMORY 161 
answer it myself by asking you an easier one: As we 
sit with the sunlight streaming into our room, where is 
the darkness which filled it last night? And where will 
all this light be at midnight tonight? Answer these 
questions, and the ones.I asked about your remembered 
facts will be answered. While it is true that, regardless 
of the conditions in our little room, darkness still exists 
wherever there is no light, and light still exists wherever 
* there is no darkness, yet for this particular room there 
ts no darkness when the sun shines in, and there is no 
slight when the room is filled with darkness. So in the 
case of a remembered fact. Although the fact that Co- 
lumbus discovered America some four hundred years 
ago, that your house is of a white color, that it rained 
a week ago today, exists as a fact regardless of whether 
your minds think of these things at all, yet the truth re- 
mains as before: for the particular mind which remem- 
bers these things, the facts did not exist while they were 
out of the mind. 
It is not the remembered fact which is retained, BuT 
THE POWER TO REPRODUCE THE FACT WHEN WE REQUIRE IT. 
The Physical Basis of Memory.—The power to repro- 
duce a once-known fact depends ultimately on the brain. 
This is not hard to understand if we go back a little and 
consider that brain activity was concerned in every per- 
ception we have ever had, and in every fact we have ever 
known. Indeed, it was through a certain neural ac- 
tivity of the cortex that you were able originally to know 
that Columbus discovered America, that your house is 
white, and that-it-rained-on a day in the past. Without 
this cortical activity, these facts would have existed just 
as truly, but you would never have known them. With- 
out this neural activity in the brain there is no con- 
sciousness, and to it we must look for the recurrence
-P-A-G-E-180
162 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
  in consciousness of remembered facts, as well as for 
those which appear for the first time. 
How We Remember.—Now, if we are to have a once- 
known fact repeated in consciousness, or in other words 
remembered, what we must do on the physiological side 
is to provide for a repetition of the neural activity which 
was at first responsible for the fact’s appearing in con- 
sciousness. The mental accompaniment of the repeated 
activity is the memory. Thus, as memory is the approxi- 
mate repetition of once-experienced mental states or 
facts, together with the recognition of their belonging to 
our past, so it is accomplished by an approximate repe- 
tition of the once-performed neural process in the cortex 
which originally accompanied these states or facts. 
The part played by the brain in memory makes it easy 
to understand why we find it so impossible to memorize 
or to recall when the brain is fatigued from long hours 
of work or lack of sleep. . It also explains the derange- 
ment in memory that often comes from an injury 
to the brain, or from the toxins of alcohol, drugs or 
disease. 
Dependence of Memory on Brain Quality.—Differences 
in memory ability, while depending in part on the train- 
ing memory receives, rest ultimately on the memory- 
quality of the brain. James tells us that four distinct 
types of brains may be distinguished, and he describes 
them as follows: 
Brains that are: 
(1) Like marble to receive and like marble to retain. 
(2) Like waz to receive and like waz to retain. 
(3) Like marble to receive and like waz to retain. 
(4) Like waz to receive and like marble to retain. 
The first type gives us those who memorize slowly and 
with much heroic effort, but who keep well what they
-P-A-G-E-181
  MEMORY 163 
have committed. The second type represents the ones 
who learn in a flash, who can cram up a lesson in a few 
minutes, but who forget as easily and as quickly as they 
learn. The third type characterizes the unfortunates 
who must labor hard and long for what they memorize, 
only to see it quickly slipping from their grasp. The 
fourth type is a rare boon to its possessor, enabling him 
easily to stock his memory with valuable material, which 
is readily available to him upon demand. 
The particular type of brain we possess is given us 
through heredity, and we can do little or nothing to 
change the type. Whatever our type of brain, however, 
we can do much to improve our memory by obeying the 
laws upon which all good memory depends. 
2. THE FOUR FACTORS INVOLVED IN MEMORY 
Nothing is more obvious than that memory cannot 
return to us what has never been given into its keeping, 
what has not been retained, or what for any reason 
cannot be recalled. Further, if the facts given back by 
memory are not recognized as belonging to our past, 
memory would be incomplete. Memory, therefore, in- 
volves the following four factors: (1) registration, (2) 
retention, (3) recall, (4) recognition. 
Registration.—By registration we mean the learning 
or committing of the matter to be remembered. On the 
brain side this involves producing in the appropriate 
neurones the activities which, when repeated again later, 
cause the fact to be recalled. It is this process that con- 
stitutes what we call ‘‘impressing the facts upon the 
brain.’’ 
Nothing is more fatal to good memory than partial or 
faulty registration. A thing but half learned is sure
-P-A-G-E-182
  164 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
to be forgotten. We often stop in the mastery of a les- 
son just short of the full impression needed for per- 
manent retention and sure recall. We sometimes say - 
to our teachers, ‘‘I cannot remember,’’ when, as a mat- 
ter of fact, we have never learned the thing we seek to 
recall. 
Retention.—Retention, as we have already seen, re- 
sides primarily in the brain. It is accomplished through 
the law of habit working in the neurones of the cortex. 
Here, as elsewhere, habit makes an activity once per- 
formed more easy of performance each st succeeding time. 
Through this law a neural activity once performed ‘tends 
to be repeated; or, in other words, a fact once known in 
consciousness tends to be remembered. That so large a 
part of our past is lost in oblivion, and out of the reach” 
of our memory, is probably much more largely due to 
a failure to recall than to retain. We say that we have 
forgotten a fact or a name which we cannot recall, try as 
hard as we may; yet surely all have had the experience 
of a long-striven-for fact suddenly appearing in our 
memory when we had given it up and no longer had 
use for it. It was retained all the time, else it never 
could have come back at all. 
An aged man of my acquaintance lay on his death- 
bed. In his childhood he had first learned to speak 
German; but, moving with his family when he was 
eight or nine years of age to an English-speaking com- 
munity, he had lost his ability to speak German, and 
had been unable for a third of a century to carry on 
a conversation in his mother tongue. Yet during the 
last days of his sickness he lost almost wholly the power 
to use the English language, and spoke fluently in Ger- 
man. During all these years his brain paths had re- 
tained the power to reproduce the forgotten words, even
-P-A-G-E-183
    MEMORY 165 
though for so long a time the words could not be re- 
called. James quotes a still more striking case of an 
aged woman who was seized with a fever and, during 
her delirious ravings, was heard talking in Latin, He- 
brew and Greek. She herself could neither read nor 
write, and the priests said she was possessed of a devil. 
But a physician unraveled the mystery. When the girl 
was nine years of age, a pastor, who was a noted scholar, 
had taken her into his home as a servant, and she had 
remained there until his death. During this time she 
had daily heard him read aloud from his books in these 
languages. Her brain had indelibly retained the record 
made upon it, although for years she could not have 
recalled a sentence, if, indeed, she had ever been able 
to do so. 
Recall.—Reeall depends entirely on association. 
There is no way to arrive at a certain fact or name that 
is eluding us except by means of some other facts, names, 
or what-not so related to the missing term as to be able 
to bring it into the fold. Memory arrives at any de- 
sired fact only over a bridge of associations. It there- 
fore follows that the more associations set up between 
the fact to be remembered and related facts already in 
the mind, the more certain the recall. | Historical dates 
and events should when learned be associated with im- 
portant central dates and events to which they naturally 
attach. Geographical names, places or other information 
should be connected with related material already in the 
mind. Scientific knowledge should form a coherent and 
related whole. In short, everything that is given over 
to the memory for its keeping should be linked as closely 
as possible to material of the same sort. This is all to 
say that we should not expect our memory to retain 
and reproduce isolated, unrelated faets, but should give
-P-A-G-E-184
  166 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
it the advantage of as many logical and well grounded 
associations as possible. 
Recognition A fact reproduced by memory but not 
recognized as belonging to our past experience would 
impress us as a new fact. This would mean that mem- 
ory would fail to link the present to the past. Often we 
are puzzled to know whether we have before met a cer- 
tain person, or on a former occasion told a certain story, 
or previously experienced a certain present state of mind 
which seems half familiar. Such baffling mental states 
are usually but instances of partial and incomplete rec- 
ognition. Recognition no longer applies to much of 
our knowledge; for example, we say we remember that 
four times six is twenty-four, but probably none of us 
ean recall when and where we learned this fact—we can- 
not recognize it as belonging to our past experience. 
So with ten thousand other things, which we know rather 
than remember in the strict sense. 
3. THE STUFF OF MEMORY 
What are the forms in which memory presents the 
past to us? What are the elements with which it deals? 
What is the stuff of which it consists? 
Images as the Material of Memory.—In the light of our 
discussion upon mental imagery, and with the aid of a 
little introspection, the answer is easy. I ask you to re- 
member your home, and at once a visual image of the 
familiar house, with its well-known rooms and their 
characteristic furnishings, comes to your mind. I ask 
you to remember the last concert you attended, or the 
chorus of birds you heard recently in the woods; and 
there comes a flood of images, partly visual, but largely 
auditory, from the melodies you heard. Or I ask you 
te
-P-A-G-E-185
  MEMORY 167 
to remember the feast of which you partook yesterday, 
and gustatory and olfactory images are prominent 
among the others which appear. And so I might keep on 
until I had covered the whole range of your memory; 
and, whether I ask you for the simple trivial experiences 
of your past, for the tragic or crucial experiences, or for 
the most abstruse and abstract facts which you know and 
can recall, the case is the same: much of what memory 
presents to you comes in the form of images or of ideas 
of your past. 
Images Vary as to Type—We do not all remember 
what we call the same fact in like images or ideas. When 
you remembered that Columbus discovered America in 
1492, some of you had an image of Columbus the mar- 
iner standing on the deck of his ship, as the old picture 
shows him; and accompanying this image was an idea of 
“long agoness.’’ Others, in recalling the same fact, 
had an image of the coast on which he landed, and per- 
chance felt the rocking of the boat and heard it scraping 
on the sand as it neared the shore. And still others saw 
on the printed page the words stating that Columbus 
discovered America in 1492. And so in an infinite va- 
riety of images or ideas we may remember what we call 
the same fact, though of course the fact is not really the 
same fact to any two of us, nor to any one of us when 
it comes to us on different occasions in different images. 
Other Memory Material.—But sensory images are not 
the only material with which memory has to deal. We 
may also recall the bare fact that it rained a week ago 
today without having images of the rain. We may recall 
that Columbus discovered America in 1492 without vis- 
ual or other images of the event. As a matter of fact 
we do constantly recall many facts of abstract nature, 
such as mathematical or scientific formule with no
-P-A-G-E-186

imagery other than that of the words or symbols, if in- 
deed these be present. Memory may therefore use as its 
stuff not only images, but also a wide range of facts, 
ideas and meanings of all sorts. 
  4, LAWS UNDERLYING MEMORY 
The development of a good memory depends in no 
small degree on the closeness with which we follow cer- 
tain well-demonstrated laws. 
The Law of Association.—The law of association, as we 
have already seen, is fundamental. Upon it the whole 
structure of memory depends. Stating this law in neu- 
ral terms we may say: Brain areas which are active 
together at the same time tend to establish associative 
paths, so that when one of them is again active the other 
is also brought into activity. Expressing the same truth 
in mental terms: If two facts or experiences occur to- 
gether im consciousness, and one of them is later re- 
called, it tends to cause the other to appear also. 
The Law of Repetition.—The law of repetition is but a 
restatement of the law of habit, and may be formulated. 
as follows: The more frequently a certain cortical ac- 
tivity occurs, the more easily is its repetition brought 
about. Stating this law in mental terms we may say: 
The more often a fact is recalled in consciousness the 
easier and more certain the recall,becomes. It is upon 
the law of repetition that reviews and drills to fix things 
in the memory are based. 
The Law of Recency.—We may state the law of recency 
in physiological terms as follows: The more recently 
brain centers have been employed in a certain activity, 
the more easily are they thrown into the same activity. 
This, on the mental side, means: The more recently
-P-A-G-E-187
  MEMORY 169 
any facts have been present in consciousness the more 
easily are they recalled. It is in obedience to this law 
that we want to rehearse a difficult lesson just before 
the recitation hour, or cram immediately before an ex- 
amination. The working of this law also explains the 
tendency of all memories to fade out as the years pass by. 
The Law of Vividness.—The law of vividness is of pri- 
mary importance in memorizing. On the physical side 
it may be expressed as follows: The higher the tension 
or the more intense the activity of neural centers the 
more easily the activity is repeated. The counterpart 
of this law in mental terms is: The higher the degree 
of attention or concentration when the fact is registered 
the more certain it is of recall. Better far one impres- 
sion of a high degree of vividness than several repeti- 
tions with the attention wandering or the brain too 
fatigued to respond. Not drill alone, but drill with con- 
centration, is necessary to sure memory,—in proof of 
which witness the futile results on the part of the small 
boy who ‘‘studies his spelling lesson over fifteen times,’’ 
the while he is at the same time counting his marbles. 
5, RULES FOR USING THE MEMORY 
Much careful and fruitful experimentation in the field 
of memory has taken place in recent years. The scien- 
tists are now able to give us certain simple rules which 
we can employ in using our memories, even if we lack 
the time or opportunity to follow all their technical 
discussions. 
Wholes Versus Parts. —Probably most people in setting 
to work to commit to memory a poem, oration, or other 
such material, have a tendency to learn it first by stanzas 
or sections and then put the parts together to form the
-P-A-G-E-188
d 
  170 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
whole. Many tests, however, have shown this to be a 
less effective method than to go over the whole poem or 
oration time after time, finally giving special attention to 
any particularly difficult places. The only exception to 
this rule would seem to be in the case of very long pro- 
ductions, which may be broken up into sections of rea-. 
sonable length. The method of committing by wholes 
instead of parts not only economizes time and effort in 
the learning, but also gives a better sense of unity and 
meaning to the matter memorized. 
Rate of Forgetting.—The rate of forgetting is found 
to be very much more rapid immediately following the 
learning than after a longer time has elapsed. This is 
to say that of what one is going to forget of matter com- 
mitted to memory approximately one-half will fall away 
within the first twenty-four hours and three-fourths 
within the first three days. Since it is always economy 
to fix afresh matter that is fading out before it has been 
wholly forgotten, it will manifestly pay to review im- 
portant memory material within the first day or two 
after it has once been memorized. 
Divided Practice.—If to commit a certain piece of ma- 
terial we must go over it, say, ten different times, the 
results are found to be much better when the entire 
number of repetitions are not had in immediate succes- 
sion, but with reasonable intervals between. This is 
due, no doubt, to the well-known fact that associations 
tend to take form and grow more secure even after we 
have ceased to think specifically of the matter in hand. 
The intervals allow time for the associations to form 
their connections. It is in this sense that James says we 
“learn to swim during the winter and to skate during 
the summer.”’ 
Forcing the Memory to Act.—In committing matter by
-P-A-G-E-189
  MEMORY 171 
reading it, the memory should be forced into activity 
just as fast as it is able to carry part of the material. 
If, after reading a poem over once, parts of it can be 
repeated without reference to the text, the memory 
should be compelled to reproduce these parts. So with 
all other material. Re-reading should be applied only 
at such points as the memory has not yet grasped. 
Not,a Memory, But Memories.—Professor James has 
emphasized the fact, which has often been demonstrated 
by experimental tests, that we do not possess a mem- 
ory, but a collection of memories. Our memory may be 
very good in one line and poor in another. Nor can 
we ‘‘train our memory”’ in the sense of practicing it in 
one line and having the improvement extend equally 
to other lines. Committing poetry may have little or no 
effect in strengthening the memory for historical or 
scientific data. In general, the memory must be trained 
in the specific lines in which it is to excel. General 
training will not serve except as it may lead to better 
modes of learning what is to be memorized. 
6. WHAT CONSTITUTES A GOOD MEMORY 
Let us next inquire what are the qualities which enter 
into what we call a good memory. The merchant or 
politician will say, ‘‘ Ability to remember well people’s 
faces and names’’; the teacher of history, “The ability 
to recall readily dates and events’’; the teacher of mathe- 
matics, ‘‘The power to recall mathematical formule’’; 
the hotel waiter, ibe ite, Sop a ee 
dozen orders at a time’’; the manager of a corporation, 
“¢The ability to recall all the necessary details connected 
with the running of the-eoncern;’?~ While these answers 
are very divergent, yet they may all be true for the par-
-P-A-G-E-190
    172 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
ticular person testifying; for out of them all there 
emerges this common truth, that the best memory ts the 
one which best serves its possessor. That is, one’s mem- 
ory not only must be ready and exact, but must produce 
the right kind of material; it must bring to us what we 
need in our thinking. A very easy corollary at once 
grows out of this fact; namely, that in order to have the 
memory return to us the right kind of matter, we must 
store it with the right kind of images and ideas, for the 
memory cannot give back to us anything which we have 
not first given into its keeping. 
A Good Memory Selects Its Material—The best memory 
is not necessarily the one which impartially repeats the 
largest number of facts of past experience. Every- 
one has many experiences which he never needs to have 
reproduced in memory; useful enough they may have 
been at the time, but wholly useless and irrelevant later. 
They have served their purpose, and should henceforth 
slumber -in oblivion. They would be but so much rub- 
bish and lumber if they could be recalled. Everyone 
has surely met that particular type of bore whose: mem- 
ory is so faithful to details that no incident in the 
story he tells, no matter however trivial, is ever omit- 
ted in the recounting. His associations work in such a 
tireless round ‘of-minute succession, without ever being 
able to take a jump or a short cut, that he is powerless 
to separate the wheat from the chaff; so he dumps the 
whole indiscriminate mass into our long-suffering ears. 
Dr. Carpenter tells of a member of Parliament who 
could repeat long legal documents and. acts of Parlia- 
ment after one reading. When he was congratulated on 
his remarkable gift, he replied that, instead of being an 
advantage to him, it was often a source of great in- 
convenience, because when he wished to recollect any-
-P-A-G-E-191
  MEMORY 173 
thing in a document he had read, he could do it only 
by repeating the whole from the beginning up to the 
point which he wished to recall. Maudsley says that the 
kind of memory which enables a person ‘‘to read a photo- 
graphic copy of former impressions with his mind’s eye 
is not, indeed, commonly associated with high intellec- 
tual power,’’ and gives as a reason that such a mirtd is 
hindered by the very wealth of material furnished by 
the memory from discerning the relations between sep- 
arate facts upon which judgment and reasoning depend. 
It is likewise a common source of surprise among teach- 
ers that many of the pupils who could outstrip their 
classmates in learning and memory do not turn out to be 
able men. But this, says Whately, ‘‘is as reasonable as 
to wonder that a cistern if filled should not be a per- 
petual fountain.’’ It is possible for one to be so lost in 
a tangle of trees that he cannot see the woods. 
A’Good Memory Requires Good Thinking.—It is not, 
then, mere re-presentation of facts that constitutes. a 
good memory. The pupil who can reproduce a history 
lesson by the page has not necessarily as good a memory 
‘as the one who remembers fewer facts, but sees the re- 
lations between those remembered, and hence is able to 
choose what he will remember. Memory must be dis- 
criminative. It must fasten on that which is important 
and keep that for us. Therefore we can agree that “‘the 
art of remembering is the art of thinking.’’ Diserimi- 
nation must select the important out of our mental 
stream, and these images must be associated with as 
many others as possible which are already well fixed in 
memory, and hence are sure of recall when needed. In 
. this way the old will always serve as a cue to call up 
the new. 
Memory Must Be Specialized—_And not only must mem-
-P-A-G-E-192
  174 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
ory, if it is to be a good memory, omit the generally 
worthless, or trivial, or irrelevant, and supply the gen- 
erally useful, significant, and relevant, but it must in 
some degree be a specialized memory. It must minister 
to the particular needs and requirements of its owner. 
Small consolation to you if you are a Latin teacher, and 
are able to call up the binomial theorem or the date of 
the fall of Constantinople when you are in dire need of 
a conjugation or a declension which eludes you. It is 
much better for the merchant and politician to have a 
good memory for names and faces than to be able to 
repeat the succession of English monarchs from Alfred 
the Great to Edward VII and not be able to tell John 
Smith from Tom Brown. It is much more desirable 
for the lawyer to be able to remeinber the necessary de- 
tails of his: case than to be able to recall all the various 
athletic records of the year; and so on. 
In order to be a good memory for us, our memory 
must be faithful in dealing with the material which 
constitutes the needs of our vocations. Our memory 
may, and should, bring to us many things outside of our 
immediate vocations, else our lives will be narrow; but 
its chief concern and most accurate work must be along 
the path of our everyday requirements at its hands. 
And this works out well in connection with the physiolo- 
gical laws which were stated a little while since, pro- 
viding that our vocations are along the line of our 
interests. For the things with which we. work daily, 
and in which we are interested, will be often thought of 
together, and hence will become well associated. They 
will be frequently recalled, and hence more easily re- 
membered ; they will be vividly experienced as the in- 
evitable result of interest, and this goes far to insure 
recall.
-P-A-G-E-193

7. MEMORY DEVICES 
Many devices have been invented for training or using 
the memory, and not a few worthless ‘‘systems’’ have 
been imposed by conscienceless fakers upon uninformed 
people. All memorizing finally must go back to the fun- 
damental laws of brain activity and the rules growing 
gut of these laws. There is no ‘‘royal road’’ to a good 
memory. 
The Effects of Cramming—Not a few students depend 
on cramming for much of their learning. If this method 
of study would yield as valuable permanent results, it 
would be by far the most sensible and economical method 
to use; for under the stress of necessity we often are able 
to accomplish results much faster than when no pressure 
is resting upon us. The difficulty is, however, that the 
results are not permanent; the facts learned do not have 
time to seek out and link themselves to well-established 
associates; learned in an hour, their retention is as 
ephemeral as the application which gave them to us. 
Facts which are needed but temporarily and which 
cannot become a part of our body of permanent knowl- 
edge may profitably be learned by cramming. The law- 
yer needs many details for the case he is trying, which 
not only are valueless to him as soon as the case is de- 
cided, but would positively be in his way. He may prof- 
itably cram such facts. But those facts which are to 
become a permanent part of his mental equipment, such 
as the fundamental principles of law, he cannot cram. 
These he must have in a logical chain which will not 
leave’ their recall dependent upon a chance cue. 
Crammed facts may serve us during a recitation or an 
examination, but they never really become a part of us. 
Nothing can take the place of the logical placing of facts
-P-A-G-E-194
176 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
  if they are to be remembered with facility, and be usable 
in thinking when recalled. 
Remembering Isolated Facts—But after all this is 
taken into consideration there still remain a large num- 
ber of facts which refuse to fit into any connected or 
logical system. Or, if they do belong with some system, 
their connection is not very close, and we have more 
need for the few individual facts than for the system 
as a whole. Hence we must have some means of remem- 
bering such facts other than by connecting them with 
their logical associations. Such facts as may be typified 
by the multiplication table, certain dates, events, names, 
numbers, errands, and engagements of various kinds— 
all these need to be remembered accurately and quickly 
when the occasion for them arises. We must be able to 
recall them with facility, so that the occasion will not 
have passed by before we can secure them and we have 
failed to do our part because of the lapse. 
With facts of this type the means of securing a 
good memory are the same as in the case of logical 
memory, except that we must of necessity forego the 
linking ‘to naturally related associates. We can, how- 
ever, take advantage of the three laws which have been 
given. If these methods are used faithfully, then we 
have done what we can in the way of insuring the recall 
of facts of this type, unless we associate them with some 
artificial cue, such as tying a thread around our finger 
to remember an errand, or learning the multiplication 
table by singing it. We are not to be too ready to ex- 
cuse ourselves, however, if we have forgotten to mail 
the letter or deliver the message; for our attention may 
have been very lax when we recorded the direction in 
the first place, and we may never have taken the trouble 
to think of the matter between the time it was given 
 
-P-A-G-E-195
  MEMORY 177 
into our keeping and the time we were to perform the 
errand. 
Mnemonic Devices.—Many ingenious devices have been 
invented to assist the memory. No doubt each one of 
you has some way of your own of remembering certain 
things committed to you, or some much-needed fact 
which has a tendency to elude you. You may not tie 
the traditional string around your finger or place your 
watch in the wrong pocket ; but if not, you have invented 
some method which suits your convenience better. While 
many books have been written, and many lectures given 
exploiting mnemonic systems, they are, however, all 
founded upon the same general principle: namely, that 
of association of ideas in the mind. They all make use 
of the same basis for memory that any of us use every 
time we remember anything, from the commonest event 
which occurred last hour to the most abstruse bit of 
philosophy which we may have in our minds. They 
all tie the fact to be remembered to some other fact 
which is sure of recall, and then trust the old fact to 
bring the new along with it when it again comes into 
the mind. 
Artificial devices may be permissible in remembering 
the class of facts which have no logical associates to 
which we can relate them; but even then I cannot help 
feeling that if we should use the same care and inge- 
nuity in carefully recording the seemingly unrelated 
facts that we do in working out the device and making 
the association in it, we should discover hidden relations 
for most of the facts we wish to remember, and we 
should be able to insure their recall as certainly and in 
a better way than through the device. Then, also, we 
should not be in danger of handing over to the device 
various facts for which we should discover relations, thus
-P-A-G-E-196
    178 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
placing them in the logical body of our usable knowledge 
where they belong. 
8. PROBLEMS IN OBSERVATION AND INTROSPECTION 
1. Carefully consider your own powers of memory and see 
whether you can decide which of the four types of brain 
you have. Apply similar tests to your classmates or a group 
of school children whom you have a chance to observe. Be 
sure to take into account the effects of past training or habits 
of memory. 
2. Watch in your own memorizing and also that of school 
children for failures in recall caused by lack of proper asso- 
ciations. Why is it particularly hard to commit what one does 
not understand? 
3. Observe a class in a recitation or an examination and 
seek to discover whether any defects of memory revealed are 
to be explained by lack of (1) repetition, (2) recency, (3) 
vividness in learning. 
4. Make a study of your own class and also of a group of 
children in school to discover their methods of memorizing. 
Have in mind the rules for memorizing given in section 5 of 
this chapter. 
5. Observe by introspection your method of recall of his- 
torical events you have studied, and note whether images form 
an important part of your memory material; or does your 
recall consist chiefly of bare facts? In how far does this de- 
pend on your method of learning the facts in the first place? 
6. Carefully consider your experience from cramming your 
lessons. Does the material learned in this way stay with you? 
Do you understand it and find yourself able to use it as well 
as stuff learned during a longer interval and with more time 
for associations to form?
-P-A-G-E-197
CHAPTER XII 
THINKING 
No word is more constantly on our lips than the word 
think. A hundred times a day we tell what we think 
about this thing or that. Any exceptional power of 
thought classes us among the efficient of our generation. 
It is in their ability to think that men stand preémi- 
nently above the animals. 
1. DIFFERENT TYPES OF THINKING 
The term think, or thinking, is employed in so many 
different senses that it will be well first of all to come to 
an understanding as to its various uses. Four different 
types of thinking which we shall note are:* (1) chance, 
or idle, thinking; (2) thinking in the form of uncritical 
belief; (3) assimilative thinking; and (4) deliberative 
thinking. 
Chance or Idle Thinking.—Our thinking is of the 
chance or idle kind when we think to no conscious end. 
No particular problem is up for solution, and the stream 
of thought drifts along in idleness. In such thinking, 
immediate interest, some idle fancy, the impulse of the 
moment, or the suggestions from our environment deter- 
mine the train of associations and give direction to our 
thought. In a sense, we surrender our mental bark to 
the winds of circumstance to drive it whithersoever they 
*Cf. Dewey, “How We Think,” p. 2 ff. 
179
-P-A-G-E-198
    180 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
will without let or hindrance from us. Since no results 
are sought from our thinking, none are obtained. The 
best of us spend more time in these idle trains of thought 
than we would like to admit, while inferior and untrained 
minds seldom rise above this barren thought level. Not 
infrequently even when we are studying a lesson which 
demands our best thought power we find that an idle 
chain of associations has supplanted the more rigid type 
of thinking and appropriated the field. 
Unceritical Belief—We often say that we think a cer- 
tain thing is true or false when we have, as a matter of 
fact, done little or no thinking about it. We only be- 
lieve, or uncritically accept, the common point of view 
as to the truth or untruth of the matter concerned. The 
ancients believed that the earth was flat, and the savages 
that eclipses were caused by animals eating up the moon. 
Not a few people today believe that potatoes and other 
vegetables should be planted at a certain phase of the 
moon, that sickness is a visitation of Providence, and 
that various ‘‘charms’’ are potent to bring good fortune 
or ward off disaster. Probably not one in a thousand of 
those who accept such beliefs could give, or have ever 
tried to give, any rational reason for their point of 
view. 
But we must not be too harsh toward such crude illus- 
trations of uncritical thinking. It is entirely possible 
that not all of us who pride ourselves on our trained 
powers of thought could give good reasons discovered 
by our own thinking why we think our political party, 
our church, or our social organization is better than some 
other one. How few of us, after all, really discover our 
creed, join a church, or choose a political party! We 
adopt the points of view of our nation or our group 
much as we adopt their customs and dress—not because
-P-A-G-E-199
  THINKING 181 
‘we are convinced by thinking that they are best, but 
because they are less trouble. 
Assimilative Thinking.—It is this type of thinking 
that occupies us when we seek to appropriate new 
facts or ideas and understand them; that is, relate 
them to knowledge already on hand. We think after 
this fashion in much of our study in schools and text- 
books. The problem for our thought is not so much 
one of invention or discovery as of grasp and assimila- 
tion. Our thinking is to apprehend meanings and 
relations, and so unify and give coherence to our knowl- 
edge. 
In the absence of this type of thinking one may com- 
mit to memory many facts that he does not understand, 
gather much information that contains little meaning 
to him, and even achieve very creditable scholastic 
grades that stand for a small amount of education or 
development. For all information, to become vital and 
usable, must be thought into relation to our present ac- 
tive, functioning body of knowledge; therefore assimila- 
tive thinking is fundamental to true mastery and 
learning. 
Deliberative Thinking.—Deliberative thinking consti- 
tutes the highest type of thought process. In order to 
do deliberative thinking there is necessary, first of all, 
what Dewey calls a ‘‘split-road’’ situation. A traveler 
going along a well-beaten highway, says Dr. Dewey, does 
not deliberate; he simply keeps on going. But let the 
highway split into two roads at a fork, only one of which 
leads to the desired destination, and now a problem con- 
fronts him; he must take one road or the other, but 
which? The intelligent traveler will at once go to seek- 
ing for evidence as to which road he should choose. He 
will balance this fact against that fact, and this prob- 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
182 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
  ability against that probability, in an effort to arrive at 
a solution of his problem. 
Before we can engage in deliberative thinking we must 
be confronted by some problem, some such ‘‘split-road’’ 
situation in our mental stream—we must have something 
to think about. It is this fact that makes one writer 
say that the great purpose of one’s education is not to 
solve all his problems for him. It is rather to help him 
(1) to discover problems, or ‘‘split-road’’ situations, (2) 
to assist him in gathering the facts necessary for their 
solution, and (3) to train him in the weighing of his 
facts or evidence, that is, in deliberative thinking. Only 
as we learn to recognize the true problems that confront 
us in our own lives and in society about us can we be- 
eome thinkers in the best sense. Our own plans and 
projects, the questions of right and wrong that are con- 
stantly arising, the social, political and religious prob- 
lems awaiting solution, all afford the opportunity and 
the necessity for deliberative thinking. And unhappy is 
the pupil whose school work does not set the problems 
and employ the methods which will insure training in 
this as well as in the assimilative type of thinking. 
Every school subject, besides supplying certain informa- 
tion to be ‘‘learned,’’ should present its problems re- 
quiring true deliberative thinking within the range of 
development and ability of the pupil, and no subject— 
literature, history, science, language—is without many 
such problems. 
2, THE FUNCTION OF THINKING 
All true thinking is for the purpose of discovering 
relations between the things we think about. Imagine a 
world in which nothing is related to anything else; in
-P-A-G-E-201
THINKING 183 
  which every object perceived, remembered, or imagined, 
stands absolutely by itself, independent and self-suffi- 
cient! What a chaos it would be! We might perceive, 
remember, and imagine all the various objects we please, 
but without the power to think them together, they 
would all be totally unrelated, and hence have no mean- 
ing. 
Meaning Depends on Relations.—To have a rational 
meaning for us, things must always be defined in terms 
of other things, or in terms of their uses. Fuel is that 
which feeds fire. Food is what is eaten for nourish- 
ment. A locomotive is a machine for drawing a train. 
Books are to read, pianos to play, balls to throw, schools 
to instruct, friends to enjoy, and so on through the whole 
list of objects which we know or can define. Everything 
depends for its meaning on its relation to other things; 
and the more of these relations we can discover, the more 
fully do we see the meaning. Thus balls may have other 
uses than to throw, schools other functions than to in- 
struct, and friends mean much more to us than mere 
enjoyment. And just in the degree in which we have 
realized these different relations, have we defined the 
object, or, in other words, have we seen its meaning. 
The Function of Thinking is to Discover Relations.— 
Now it is by thinking that these relations are discovered. 
This is the function of thinking. Thinking takes the va- 
rious separate items of our experience and discovers to 
us the relations existing among them, and builds them 
together into a unified, related, and usable body of knowl- 
edge, threading each little bit on the string of rela- 
tionship which runs through the whole. It was, no 
doubt, this thought which Tennyson had in mind when 
he wrote:
-P-A-G-E-202
THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
  Flower in the crannied wall, 
I pluck you out of the crannies, 
I hold you here, root and all, in my hand, 
Little flower—but if I could understand 
What you are, root and all, and all in all, 
I should know what God and man is. 
Starting in with even so simple a thing as a little 
flower, if he could discover all the relations which 
every part bears to every other part and to all other 
things besides, he would finally reach the meaning 
of God and man. For each separate thing, be it 
large or small, forms a link in an unbroken chain 
of relationships which binds the universe into an or- 
dered whole. 
Near and Remote Relations.—The relations discovered 
through our thinking may be very close and simple ones, 
as when a child sees the relation between his bottle and 
his dinner; or they may be very remote ones, as when 
Newton saw the relation between the falling of an apple 
and the motion of the planets in their orbits. But 
whether simple or remote, the seeing of the relationships 
is in both eases alike thinking; for thinking is nothing, 
in its last analysis, but the discovering of the relation- 
ships which exist between the various objects in our men- 
tal stream. 
Thinking passes through all grades of complexity, 
from the first faint dawnings in the mind of the babe 
when it sees the relation between the mother and its 
feeding, on to the mighty grasp of the sage who is able 
to ‘‘think God’s thoughts after Him.’’ But it all comes 
to the same end finally—the bringing to light of new 
meanings through the discovery of new relations. And 
whatever does this is thinking. 
Child and Adult Thinking.—What constitutes the dif-
-P-A-G-E-203
  THINKING 185 
ference in the thinking of the child and that of the sage? 
Let us see whether we can discover this difference. In 
the first place the relations seen by the child are imme- 
diate relations: they exist between simple percepts or 
images; the remote and the general are beyond his reach. 
He has not had sufficient experience to enable him to 
discover remote relations. He cannot think things which 
are absent from him, or which he has never known. 
The child could by no possibility have seen in the falling 
apple what Newton saw; for the child knew nothing of 
the planets in their orbits, and hence could not see re- 
lations in which these formed one of the terms. The 
sage, on the other hand, is not limited to his immediate 
percepts or their images. He can see remote relations. 
He can go beyond individuals, and think in classes. The 
falling apple is not a mere falling apple to him, 
but one of a class of falling bodies. Besides a rich ex- 
perience full of valuable facts, the trained thinker 
has acquired also the habit of looking out for relations; 
he has learned that this is the method par excellence 
of inereasing his store of knowledge and of rendering 
effective the knowledge he has. He has learned how to 
think. 
The chief business of the child is the collection of 
the materials of thought, seeing only the more necessary 
and obvious relations as he proceeds; his chief business 
when older grown is to seek out the network of relations 
. which unites this mass of material, and through this 
process to systematize and give new meanings to the 
whole. 
3. THE MECHANISM OF THINKING 
It is evident from the foregoing discussion that we 
may include under the term thinking all sorts of men- 
 
-P-A-G-E-204
    186 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
tal processes by which relations are apprehended be- 
tween different objects of thought. Thus young children 
think as soon as they begin to understand something of 
the meaning of the objects of their environment. Even 
animals think by means of simple and direct associations. 
Thinking may therefore go on in terms of the simplest 
and most immediate, or the most complex and distant 
relationships. 
Sensations and Percepts as Elements in Thinking.—Re- 
lations seen between sensations would mean something, 
but not much; telations seen between objects immedi- 
ately present to the senses would mean much more; but 
our thinking must go far beyond the present, and like- 
wise far beyond individual objects. It must be able to 
annihilate both time and space, and to deal with mil- 
lions of individuals together in one group or class. Only 
in this way can our thinking go beyond that of the lower 
animals; for a wise rat, even, may come to see the rela- 
tion between a trap and danger, or a horse the relation 
between pulling with his teeth at the piece of string on 
the gate latch, and securing his liberty. 
But it takes the farther-reaching mind of man to 
amvent the trap and the latch. Perception alone does 
not go far enough. It is limited to immediately present 
objects and their most obvious relations. The percep- 
tual image is likewise subject to similar limitations. 
While it enables us to dispense with the immediate 
presence of the object, yet it deals with separate in- 
dividuals; and the world is too full of individual ob- 
jects for us to deal with them separately. It is in 
conception, judgment, and reasoning that true think- 
ing takes place. Our next purpose will therefore be 
to study these somewhat more closely, and see how they 
combine in our thinking.
-P-A-G-E-205
  THINKING 187 
4, THE CONCEPT 
Fortunately for our thinking, the great external world, 
with its millions upon millions of individual objects, is 
so ordered that these objects can be grouped into com- 
paratively few great classes; and for many purposes we 
can deal with the class as a whole instead of with the 
separate individuals of the class. Thus there are an 
infinite number of individual objects in the world which 
are composed of matter. Yet all these myriads of in- 
dividuals may be classed under the two great heads of 
inanimate and animate. Taking one of these again: all 
animate forms may be classed as either plants or ani- 
mals. And these classes may again be subdivided indefi- 
nitely. Animals include mammals, birds, reptiles, in- 
sects, mollusks, and many other classes besides, each class 
of which may be still further separated into its orders, 
families, genera, species, and individuals. This arrange- 
ment economizes our thinking by allowing us to think in 
large terms. 
The Concepts Serve to Group and Classify.—But the 
somewhat complicated form of classification just de- 
scribed did not come to man ready-made. Someone had 
to see the relationship existing among the myriads of 
animals of a certain class, and group these together un- 
der the general term mammals. Likewise with birds, 
reptiles, insects, and all the rest. In order to accom- 
plish this, many individuals of each class had to be ob- 
served, the qualities common to all members of the class 
discriminated from those not common, and the common 
qualities retained as the measure by which to test the 
admission of other individuals into this class. The 
process of classification is made possible by what the psy- 
chologist calls the concept. The concept enables us to
-P-A-G-E-206
    188 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
think birds as well as bluebirds, robins, and wrens; it 
enables us to think men as well as Tom, Dick, and Harry. 
In other words, the concept lies at the bottom of all 
thinking which rises above the seeing of the simplest 
relations between immediately present objects. 
Growth of a Concept.—We can perhaps best under- 
stand the nature of the concept if we watch its growth 
in the thinking of a child. Let us see how the child 
forms the concept dog, under which he is able finally to 
class the several hundred or the several thousand dif- 
ferent dogs with which his thinking requires him to deal. 
The child’s first acquaintance with a dog is, let us sup- 
pose, with a pet poodle, white in color, and named Gyp. 
At this stage in the child’s experience, dog and Gyp 
are entirely synonymous, including Gyp’s color, size, 
and all other qualities which the child has discovered. 
But now let him see another pet poodle which is like 
Gyp except that it is black in color. Here comes the 
first cleavage between Gyp and dog as synonyms: dog 
no longer means white, but may mean black. Next let 
the child see a brown spaniel. Not only will white and 
black now no longer answer to dog, but the roly-poly 
poodle form also has been lost; for the spaniel is more 
slender. Let the child go on from this until he has 
seen many different dogs of all varieties: poodles, bull- 
dogs, setters, shepherds, cockers, and a host of others. 
What has happened to his dog, which at the beginning 
meant the one particular little individual with which he 
played? 
Dog is no longer white or black or brown or gray: 
color is not an essential quality, so it has dropped out; 
size is no longer essential except within very broad lim- 
its; shagginess or smoothness of coat is a very incon- 
stant quality, so this is dropped; form varies so much
-P-A-G-E-207
THINKING 189 
from the fat pug to the slender hound that it is dis- 
earded, except within broad limits; good nature, play- 
fulness, friendliness, and a dozen other qualities are 
likewise found not to belong in common to all dogs, and 
so have had to go; and all that is left to his dog is 
four-footedness, and a certain general form, and a few 
other dog qualities of habit of life and disposition. As 
the term dog has been gaining in extent, that is, as more 
individuals have been observed and classed under it, it 
has correspondingly been losing in content, or it has 
been losing in the specific qualities which belong to it. 
Yet it must not be thought that the process is altogether 
one of elimination; for new qualities which are present 
in all the individuals of a class, but at first overlooked; 
are continually being discovered as experience grows, 
and built into the developing concept. 
Definition of Concept.—aA concept, then, is owr general 
idea or notion of a class of individual objects. Its func- 
tion is to enable us to classify our knowledge, and thus 
deal with classes or universals in our thinking. Often 
the basis of a concept consists of an image, as when you 
get a hazy visual image of a mass of people when I sug- _ 
gest mankind to you. Yet the core, or the vital, func- 
tioning part of a concept is its meaning. Whether this 
meaning attaches to an image or a word or stands rela- 
tively or completely independent of either, does not 
so much matter; but our meanings must be right, else 
all our thinking is wrong. 
Language and the Concept.—We think in words. None 
has failed to watch the flow of his thought as it is car- 
ried along by words like so many little boats moving 
along the mental stream, each with its freight of mean- 
ing. And no one has eseaped the temporary balking of 
his thought by failure to find a suitable word to convey 
 
-P-A-G-E-208
  190 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
the intended meaning. What the grammarian calls the 
common nouns of our language are the words by which 
we name our concepts and are able to speak of them 
to others. We define a common noun as ‘‘the name of 
a class,’’ and we define a concept as the meaning or idea 
we have of a class. It is easy to see that when we have 
named these class ideas we have our list of common 
nouns. The study of the language of a people may 
therefore reveal much of their type of thought. 
The Necessity for Growing Concepts.——The develop- 
ment of our concepts constitutes a large part of our edu- 
cation. For it is evident that, since thinking rests so 
fundamentally on concepts, progress in our mental life 
must depend on a constant growth in the number and 
character of our concepts. Not only must we keep on 
adding new concepts, but the old must not remain static. 
When our concepts stop growing, our minds have ceased 
to grow—we no longer learn. This arrest of develop- 
ment is often seen in persons who have settled into a life 
of narrow routine, where the demands are few and 
of a simple nature. Unless they rise above their routine, 
they early become ‘‘old fogies.’’ Their concepts petrify 
from lack of use and the constant reconstruction which 
growth necessitates. 
On the other hand, the person who has upon him the 
constant demand to meet new situations or do better in 
old ones will keep on enriching his old concepts and 
forming new ones, or else, unable to do this, he will fail 
in his position. And the person who keeps on steadily 
enriching his concepts has discovered the secret of per- 
petual youth so far as his mental life is concerned. For 
him there is no old age; his thought will be always fresh, 
his experience always accumulating, and his knowledge 
growing more valuable and usable.
-P-A-G-E-209
  THINKING 191 
5. JUDGMENT © 
But in the building up of percepts and concepts, as 
well as in making use of them after they are formed, 
another process of thinking enters; namely, the process 
of judging. 
Nature of Judgment.—Judging enters more or less into 
all our thinking, from the simplest to the most complex. 
The babe lies staring at his bottle, and finally it dawns on 
his sluggish mind that this is the object from which he 
gets his dinner. He has performed a judgment. That 
is, he has alternately directed his attention to the object 
before him and to his image of former nursing, discoy- 
ered the relation existing between the two, and affirmed 
to himself, ‘‘This is what gives me my dinner.’’ ‘‘Bot- 
tle’? and ‘‘what-gives-me-my-dinner’’ are essentially 
identical to the child. Judgment is, then, the affirmation 
of the essential identity of meaning of two objects of 
thought. Even if the proposition in which we state our 
judgment has in it a negative, the definition will still 
hold, for the mental process is the same in either case. 
It is as much a judgment if we say, ‘‘The day is not- 
cold,’’ as if we say, ‘‘The day is cold.’’ 
Judgment Used in Percepts and Concepts.—How judg- 
ment enters into the forming of our percepts may be 
seen from the illustration just given. The act by which 
the child perceived his bottle had in it a large element 
of judging. He had to compare two objects of thought 
—the one from past experience in the form of images, 
and the other from the present object, in the form of 
sensations from the bottle—and then affirm their essen- 
tial identity. Of course it is not meant that what I 
have described consciously takes place in the mind of the 
child ; but some such process lies at the bottom of every
-P-A-G-E-210
  192 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
perception, whether of the child or anyone else. 
Likewise it may be seen that the forming of concepts 
depends on judgment. Every time that we meet a new 
object which has to be assigned its place in our clas- 
sification, judgment is required. Suppose the child, with 
his immature concept dog, sees for the first time a grey- 
hound. He must compare this new specimen with his 
concept dog, and decide that this is or is not a dog. If 
he discovers the identity of meaning in the essentials of 
the two objects of thought, his judgment will be affirma- 
tive, and his concept will be modified in whatever extent 
greyhound will affect it. 
Judgment Leads to General Truths——But judgment 
goes much farther than to assist in building percepts 
and concepts. It takes our concepts after they are 
formed and discovers and affirms relations between them, 
thus enabling us finally to relate classes as well as in- 
dividuals. It carries our thinking over into the realm of 
the universal, where we are not hampered by particulars. 
Let us see how this is done. Suppose we have the con- 
cept man and the concept animal, and that we think of 
these two concepts in their relation to each other. The 
mind analyzes each into its elements, compares them, 
and finds the essential identity of meaning in a sufficient 
number to warrant the judgment, man is an: animal. 
This judgment has given a new bit of knowledge, in that 
it has discovered to us a new relation between two great 
classes, and hence given both, in so far, a new meaning 
and a wider definition. And as this new relation does 
not pertain to any particular man or any particular 
animal, but includes all individuals in each class, it has 
carried us over into universals, so that we have a general 
truth and will not have to test each individual man 
henceforth to see whether he fits into this relation.
-P-A-G-E-211
THINKING 193 
Judgments also, as we will see later, constitute the 
material for our reasoning. Hence upon their validity 
will depend the validity of our reasoning. 
The Validity of Judgments.—Now, since every judg- 
ment is made up of an affirmation of relation existing 
between two terms, it is evident that the validity of the 
judgment will depend on the thoroughness of our knowl- 
edge of the terms compared. If we know but few of the 
attributes of either term of the judgment, the judgment 
is clearly unsafe. Imperfect concepts lie at the basis of 
many of our wrong judgments. A young man com- 
plained because his friend had been expelled from col- 
lege for alleged misbehavior. He said, ‘‘Mr. A. was 
the best boy in the institution.’’ It is very evident that 
someone had made a mistake in judgment. Surely no 
college would want to expel the best boy in the institu- 
tion. Either my complainant or the authorities of the 
college had failed to understand one of the terms in the 
judgment. Wither ‘‘Mr. A: ”’ or ‘‘the best boy in the 
institution’’ had been wrongly interpreted by someone. 
Likewise, one person will say, ‘‘Jones is a good man,’’ 
while another will say, ‘‘Jones is a rascal.’? Such a 
discrepancy in judgment must come from a lack of ac- 
quaintance with Jones or a lack of knowledge of what 
constitutes a good man or a rascal. 
No doubt most.of us are prone to make judgments with 
too little knowledge of the terms we are comparing, and 
it is usually those who have the least reason for confi- 
dence in their judgments who are the most certain that 
they cannot be mistaken. The remedy for faulty judg- 
ments is, of course, in making ourselves more certain of 
the terms involved, and this in turn sends us back for a 
review of our concepts or the experience upon which the 
terms depend. It is evident that no two persons can   
  
 
-P-A-G-E-212
  194 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
have just the same concepts, for all have not had the 
same experience out of which their concepts came. The 
concepts: may be named the same, and may be nearly 
enough alike so that we can usually understand each 
other; but, after all, I have mine and you have yours, 
and if we could each see the other’s in their true light, 
no doubt we should save many misunderstandings and 
quarrels. 
6. REASONING 
All the mental processes which we have so far de- 
seribed find their culmination and highest utility in 
reasoning. Not that reasoning comes last in the list of 
mental activities, and cannot take place until all the 
others have been completed, for reasoning is in some de- 
gree present almost from the dawn of consciousness. The 
difference between the reasoning of the child and that 
of the adult is largely one of degree—of reach. Reason- 
ing goes farther than any of the other processes of cog- 
nition, for it takes the relations expressed in judgments 
and out of these relations evolves still other and more 
ultimate relations. 
Nature of Reasoning.—It is hard to define reasoning 
so as to describe the precise process which oceurs; for 
it is so intermingled with perception, conception, and 
judgment, that one can hardly separate them even for 
purposes of analysis, much less to separate them func- 
tionally. We may, however, define reasoning provision- 
ally as thinking by means of a series of judgments with 
the purpose of arriving at some definite end or conclu- 
sion. What does this mean? Professor Angell has 
stated the matter so clearly that I will quote his illustra- 
tion of the case: 
“‘Suppose that we are about to make a long journey
-P-A-G-E-213
  THINKING 195 
which necessitates the choice from among a number of 
possible routes. This is a case of the genuinely prob- 
lematie kind. It requires reflection, a weighing of the 
pros and cons, and giving of the final decision in favor 
of one or other of several alternatives. In such a case 
the procedure of most of us is after this order. We 
think of one route as being picturesque and wholly novel, 
but also as being expensive. We think of another as 
less interesting, but also as less expensive. A third is, 
we discover, the most expedient, but also the most costly 
of the three. We find ourselves confronted, then, with 
the necessity of choosing with regard to the relative 
merits of cheapness, beauty, and speed. We proceed to 
consider these points in the light of all our interests, and 
the decision more or less makes itself. We find, for in- 
stance, that we must, under the circumstances, select the 
cheapest route.’’ 
How Judgments Function in Reasoning.—Such a line 
of thinking is very common to everyone, and one that we 
carry out in one form or another a thousand times every 
day we live. When we come to look closely at the steps 
involved in arriving at a conclusion, we detect a series 
of judgments—often not very logically arranged, to be 
sure, but yet so related that the result is safely reached 
in the end. We compare our concept of, say, the first 
route and our concept of picturesqueness, decide they 
agree, and affirm the judgment, ‘‘This route is pictur- 
esque.’? Likewise we arrive at the judgment, ‘‘This 
route is also expensive, it is interesting, etce.’’ Then 
we take the other routes and form our judgments con- 
cerning them. These judgments are all-related to each 
other in some way, some of them being more intimately 
related than others. Which judgments remain as the sig- 
nificant ones, the ones which are used to solve the problem
-P-A-G-E-214
196 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
  finally, depends on which concepts are the most vital for 
us with reference to the ultimate end in view. If time is 
the chief element, then the form of our reasoning would 
“be something like this: ‘‘Two of the routes require 
* more than three days: hence I must take the third 
route.’’ If economy is the important end, the solution 
would be as follows: ‘‘Two routes cost more than 
$1,000; I cannot afford to pay more than $800; I there- 
fore must patronize the third route.’’ 
In both cases it is evident that the conclusion is 
reached through a comparison of two or more judgments. 
This is the essential difference between judgment and 
reasoning. Whereas judgment discovers relations be- 
tween concepts, reasoning discovers relations between 
judgments, and from this evolves a new judgment which 
is the conclusion sought. The example given well illus- 
trates the ordinary method by which we reason to con- 
clusions. 
Deduction and the Syllogism.—Logic may take the con- 
clusion, with the two judgments on which it is based, 
and form the three into what is called a syllogism, of 
which the following is a classical type: 
All men are mortal; 
Socrates is a man, 
Therefore 
Socrates is mortal. 
The first judgment is in the form of a proposition which 
is called the major premise, because it is general in its 
nature, including all men. The second is the minor pre- 
mise, since it deals with a particular man. The third is 
the conclusion, in which a new relation is discovered be- 
tween Socrates and mortality.
-P-A-G-E-215
THINKING 197 
This form of reasoning is deductive, that is, it pro- 
eeeds from the general to the particular. Much of our 
reasoning is an abbreviated form of the syllogism, and 
will readily expand into it. For instance, we say, ‘‘It 
will rain tonight, for there is lightning in the west.’’ 
Expanded into the syllogism form it would be, ‘‘Light- 
ning in the west is a sure sign of rain; there is lightning 
in the west this evening; therefore, it will rain tonight.’’ 
While we do not commonly think in complete syllogisms, 
it is often convenient to cast. our reasoning in this form 
to test its validity. For example, a fallacy lurks in the 
generalization, ‘‘Lightning in the west is a sure sign of 
rain.’’ Hence the conclusion is of doubtful validity. 
Induction.— Deduction is a valuable form of reasoning, 
but a moment’s reflection will show that something must 
precede the syllogism in our reasoning. The major 
premise must be accounted for. How are we able to 
say that all men are mortal, and that lightning in the 
west is a sure sign of rain? How was this general truth 
arrived at? There is only one way, namely, through the 
observation of a large number of particular instances, or 
through induction. 
_ Induction is the method of proceeding from the par- 
ticular to the general. Many men are observed, and 
it is found that all who have been observed have died 
under a certain age. It is true that not all men have 
deen observed to die, since many are now living, and 
many more will no doubt come and live in the world 
whom we cannot observe, since mortality will have over- 
taken us before their advent. To this it may be an- 
swered that the men now living have not yet lived up to 
the limit of their time, and, besides, they have within 
them the causes working whose inevitable effect has al- 
ways been and always will be death; likewise with the  
-P-A-G-E-216
  198 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
men yet unborn, they will possess the same organism 
as we, whose very nature necessitates mortality. In the 
case of the premonitions of rain, the generalization is not 
so safe, for there have been exceptions. Lightning in 
the west at night is not always followed by rain, nor can 
we find inherent causes as in the other case which neces- 
sitates rain as an effect. 
The Necessity for Broad Induction.—Thus it is seen 
that our generalizations, or major premises, are of all 
degrees of validity. In the case of some, as the mor- 
tality of man, millions of cases have been observed and 
no exceptions found, but on the contrary, causes discov- 
ered whose operation renders the result inevitable. In 
others, as, for instance, in the generalization once made, 
‘All cloven-footed animals chew their cud,’’ not only 
had the examination of individual cases not been carried 
_ so far as in the former case when the generalization was 
made, but there were found no inherent causes residing 
in cloven-footed animals which make it necessary for 
them to chew their cud. That is, cloven feet and eud- 
chewing do not of necessity go together, and the case of 
the pig disproves the generalization. 
In practically no instance, however, is it possible for 
us to examine every case upon which a generalization 
is based; after examining a sufficient number of cases, 
and particularly if there are supporting causes, we are 
warranted in making the ‘‘inductive leap,’’ or in pro- 
ceeding at once to state our generalization as a working 
hypothesis. Of course it is easy to see that if we have 
a wrong generalization, if our major premise is invalid, 
all that follows in our chain of reasoning will be worth- 
less. This fact should render us careful in making gen- 
eralizations on too narrow a basis of induction. We 
may have observed that certain red-haired people of our
-P-A-G-E-217
  THINKING 199 
acquaintance are quick-tempered, but we are not justi- 
fied from this in making the general statement that all 
red-haired people are quick-tempered. Not only have 
we not examined a sufficient number of cases to warrant 
such a conclusion, but we have found in the red hair not 
even a cause of quick temper, but only an occasional 
concomitant. 
The Interrelation of Induction and Deduction.—Induc- 
tion and deduction must go hand in hand in building 
up our world of knowledge. Induction gives us the par- 
ticular facts out of which our system of knowledge is 
built, furnishes us with the data out of which general 
truths are formed ; deduction allows us to start with the 
generalization furnished us by induction, and from this 
vantage ground to organize and systematize our knowl- 
edge and, through the discovery of its relations, to unify 
it and make it usable. Deduction starts with a general 
truth and asks the question, ‘‘What new relations are 
made necessary among particular facts by this truth?”’ 
Induction starts with particulars, and asks the ques- 
tion, ‘‘To what general truth do these separate facts 
lead?’’ Each method of reasoning needs the other. De- 
duction must have induction to furnish the facts for its 
premises; induction must have deduction to organize 
these separate facts into a unified body of knowledge. 
‘‘Hfe only sees well who sees the whole in the parts, and 
the parts in the whole.’’ 
7. PROBLEMS IN OBSERVATION AND INTROSPECTION 
1. Watch your own thinking for examples of each of the 
four types deseribed. Observe a class of children in a recita- 
tion or at study and try to decide which type is being em- 
ployed by each child. What proportion of the time sup-
-P-A-G-E-218
  200 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
posedly given to study is given over to chance or idle think- 
ing? To assimilative thinking? To deliberative thinking? 
2. Observe children at work in school with the purpose of 
determining whether they are being taught to think, or only 
to memorize certain facts. Do you find that definitions whose 
meaning is not clear are often required of children? Which 
should come first, the definition or the meaning ahd applica- 
tion of it? 
3. It is of course evident from the relation-of induction 
and deduction that the child’s natural mode of learning a sub- 
fect is by induction. Observe the teaching of children, to 
determine whether inductive methods are commonly used. 
Outline an inductive lesson in arithmetic, physiology, geogra- 
phy, civics, ete. 
4. What concepts have you now which you are aware are 
very meager? What is your concept of mountain? How 
many have you seen? Have you any concepts which you are 
working very hard to enrich? 
5. Recall some judgment which you have made and which 
proved to be false, and see whether you can now discover 
what was wrong with it. Do you find the trouble to be an 
inadequate concept? What constitutes “good judgment”? 
“poor judgment’? Did you ever make a mistake in an ex- 
ample in, say, percentage, by saying “This is the base,” when 
it proved not to be? What was the cause of the error? 
6. Can you recall any instance in which you made too 
hasty a generalization when you had observed but few cases 
upon which to base your premise? What of your reasoning 
which followed? 
7. See whether you ean show that validity of reasoning 
rests ultimately on correct perceptions. What are you doing 
at present to increase your power of thinking? 
8. How ought this chapter to help one in making a baer 
teacher? A better student?

  CHAPTER XIII 
INSTINCT 
Norine is more wonderful than nature’s method of 
endowing each individual at the beginniag with ‘all the 
impulses, tendencies and capacities’ snat are to control 
and determine the outcome of th. life. The acorn has 
the perfect oak tree in its heart; the complete butterfly 
exists in the grub; and men at his highest powers is 
present in the babe at birth. Education adds nothing 
to what heredity supplies, but only develops what is 
present fromthe “rst. 
We are a part of a great unbroken procession of life, 
which began at the beginning and will go on till the end.: 
Each generation receives, through heredity, the products 
of the long experience through which the race has passed. 
The generation receiving the gift today lives its own 
brief life, makes its own little contribution to the sum 
total and then passes on as millions have done before. 
Through heredity, the achievements, the passions, the 
fears, and the tragedies of generations long since mold- 
ered to dust stir our blood and tone our nerves for the 
conflict of today. 
1, THE NATURE OF INSTINCT 
Every child. born into the world has resting upon him 
an unseen hand reaching out from the past, pushing 
him out to meet his environment, and guiding him in the 
4 201 i  
-P-A-G-E-220
  202 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
  start upon his journey. This impelling and guiding 
power from the past we call instinct. In the words of 
Mosso: ‘‘Instinct is the voice of past generations rever- 
berating like a distant echo in the cells of the nervous 
system. We feel the breath, the advice, the experience 
of all’ men, from those who lived on acorns and strug- 
gled like wild beasts, dying naked in the forests, down 
to the virtue and toil of our father, the fear and love 
of our mother. ’’ 
The Babe’s Dependence on Instinct—The child is born. 
ignorant and helpless. It has no memory, no reason, no 
imagination. It has nover performed a conscious act, 
and does not know how to begin. It must get started, 
but how? It has no experience tio direct it, and is unable 
to understand or imitate others of jts kind. It is at this 
point that instinct comes to the reseae, The race has 
not given the child a mind ready made—that must do. 
velop; but it has given him a ready-made nervous sys- 
tem, ready to respond with the proper movements when 
it receives the touch of its environment through the 
senses. 
And this nervous system has been so trained during 
a limitless past that its responses are the ones which are 
necessary for the welfare of iis owner. It can do a 
hundred things without having to wait to learn them. 
Burdette says of the new-born child, ‘‘ Nobody told him 
what to do. Nobody taught him. He knew. Placed sud- 
denly on the guest list of this old caravansary, he knew 
his way at once to two places in it—his bedroom and the 
dining-room.’’ A thousand generations of babies' had * 
done the same thing in the same way, and each had 
made it a little easier for this particular baby to do his 
part without learning how. 
Definition of Instinct—Jnstincts are the tendency to
-P-A-G-E-221
  INSTINCT 203 
act in certain definite ways, without previous education 
and without a conscious end in view. They are a tend- 
ency to act; for some movement, or motor adjustment, 
is the response to an instinct. They do not require 
previous education, for none is possible with many 
instinctive acts: the duck does not have to be taught 
to swim or the baby to suck. They have no conscious 
end-in view, though the result may be highly desir- 
able. . 
Says James: ‘‘The cat runs after the mouse, runs or 
shows fight before the dog, avoids falling from walls 
and trees, shuns fire and water, etc., not because he has 
any notion either of life or death, or of self, or of pres- 
ervation. He has probably attained to no one of these 
conceptions in such a way as to react definitely upon it. 
He acts in each case separately, and simply because he 
cannot help it; being so framed that when that particu- 
Jar running thing called a mouse appears in his field of 
vision he must pursue; that when that particular bark- 
ing and obstreperous thing called a dog appears he must 
retire, if at a distance, and scratch if close by; that he 
must withdraw his feet from water and his face from 
flame, ete. His nervous system is to a great extent a pre- 
organized bundle of such reactions. They are as fatal 
as sneezing, and exactly correlated to their special ex- 
citants as it to its own.’’? 
You ask, Why does the lark rise on the flash of a sun- 
beam from his meadow to the morning sky, leaving a 
trail of melody to mark his flight? Why does the beaver 
build his dam,)and the oriole hang her nest? Why 
are myriads of animal forms on the earth today do- 
ing what they were countless generations ago? Why 
does the lover seek the maid, and the mother cherish 
+¢¢Psychology,’’ p. 391.
-P-A-G-E-222
  204 |THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
her young? Because the voice of the past speaks 
to the present, and the present has no choice but to 
obey. 
Instincts Are Racial Habits.—Instincts are the habits 
of the race which it bequeaths to the individual; the in- 
dividual takes these for his start, and then modifies them 
through education, and thus adapts himself to his en- 
vironment. Through his instincts, the individual is en- 
abled to Short-cut racial experience, and begin at once 
on life activities which the race has been ages in ac- 
quiring. Instinct preserves to .us what the race has 
achieved in experience, and so starts us out where the 
race left off. 
Unmodified Instinct is Blind.—Many of the lower ani- 
mal forms act on instinct blindly, unable to use past 
experience to guide their acts, incapable of education. 
Some of them carry out seemingly marvelous activities, 
yet their acts are as automatic as those of a machine and 
as devoid of foresight. A species of mud wasp carefully 
selects clay of just the right consistency, finds a some- 
what sheltered nook under the eaves, and builds its nest, 
leaving one open door. Then it seeks a certain kind of 
spider, and having stung it so as to benumb without kill- 
ing, carries it into the new-made nest, lays its eggs on the 
body of the spider so that the young wasps may have 
food immediately upon hatching out, then goes out and 
plasters the door over carefully to exclude all intruders. 
Wonderful intelligence? Not intelligence at all. Its 
acts were dictated not by plans for the future, but by 
pressure from the past. Let the supply of clay fail, or 
the race of spiders become extinct, and the wasp is help- 
less and its species will perish. Likewise the race of 
bees and ants have done wonderful things, but individual 
bees and ants are very stupid and helpless when con-
-P-A-G-E-223
  INSTINCT 205 
‘fronted by any novel conditions to which their race has 
not been accustomed. 
Man starts in as blindly as the lower animals; but, 
thanks to his higher mental powers, this blindness soon 
gives way to foresight, and he is able to formulate pur- 
\ poseful ends and adapt his activities to their accomplish- 
ment. Possessing a larger number of instincts than the 
lower animals have, man finds possible a greater num- 
ber of responses to a more complex environment than do 
they. This advantage, coupled with his ability to re- 
construct his experience in such a way that he secures 
constantly increasing control over his environment, easily 
makes man the superior of all the animals, and enables 
him to exploit them for his own further advancement. 
2. LAW OF THE APPEARANCE AND DISAPPEARANCE 
OF INSTINCTS 
No child is born with all its instincts ripe and ready 
for action. Yet each individual contains within his own 
inner nature the Jaw which determines the order and 
time of their development. 
Instincts Appear in Succession as Required.—It is not 
well that we should be started on too many different 
lines of activity at once, hence our instincts do not all 
appear at the same time. Only as fast as we need addi- 
tional activities do they ripen. Our very earliest activi- 
ties are concerned chiefly with feeding, hence we first 
have the instincts which prompt us to take our food and 
to ery for it when we are hungry. Also we find useful 
such abbreviated instincts, called reflexes, as sneezing, 
snuffling, gagging, vomiting, starting, etc.; hence we 
have the instincts enabling us to do these things. Soon 
comes the time for teething, and, to help the matter
-P-A-G-E-224
  206 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
along, the instinct of biting enters, and the rubber ring 
isin demand. The time approaches when we are to feed 
ourselves, so the instinct arises to carry everything to 
the mouth. Now we have grown strong and must as- 
sume an erect attitude, hence the instinct to sit up and 
then to stand. Locomotion comes next, and with it the 
instinct to creep and walk. Also a language must be 
learned, and we must take part in the busy life 
about us and do as other people do; so the instinct 
to imitate arises that we may learn things quickly and 
easily. 
‘We need a spur to keep us up to our best effort, so 
the instinct of emulation emerges. We must defend 
ourselves, so the instinct of pugnacity is born. We need 
to be cautious, hence the instinct of fear. We need to 
be investigative, hence the instinct of curiosity. Much 
self-directed activity is necessary for our development, 
hence the play instinct. It is best that we should come 
to know and serve others, so the instincts of sociability 
and sympathy arise. We need to select a mate and care 
for offspring, hence the instinct of love for the other sex, 
and the parental instinct. This is far from a complete 
list of our instincts, and I have not tried to follow the 
order of their development, but I have given enough to 
show the origin of many of our life’s most important ac- 
tivities. 
Many Instincts Are Transitory.—Not only do instincts 
ripen by degrees, entering our experience one by one 
as they are needed, but they drop out when their work 
is done. Some, like the instinct of self-preservation, are 
needed our lifetime through, hence they remain to the 
end. Others, like the play instinct, serve their purpose 
and disappear or are modified into new forms in a few 
years, or a few months. The life of the instinct is
-P-A-G-E-225
  INSTINCT 207 
always as transitory as Hs the necessity for the activity 
to which it gives rise. No instinct remains wholly un- 
altered in man, for it is constantly being made over ‘in 
the light of each new experience. The instinct of self- 
preservation is modified by knowledge and experience, 
so that the defense of the man against threatened danger 
would be very different from that of the child; yet the 
instinet to protect oneself in some way remains. On the 
other hand, the instinct to romp and play is less per- 
manent. It may last into adult life, but few middle-aged 
or old people care to race about as do children. Their 
activities are occupied in other lines, and they require 
less physical exertion. 
Contrast with these two examples such instincts as 
sucking, creeping, and crying, which are much more 
fleeting than the play instinct, even. With dentition 
comes another mode of eating, and sucking is no more 
serviceable. Walking is a better mode of locomotion 
than creeping, so the instinct to creep soon dies. Speech 
is found a better way than crying to attract attention to 
distress, so this instinct drops out. Many of our in- 
stinets not only would fail to be serviceable in our later 
lives, but would be positively in the way. Each serves 
its day, and then passes over into so modified a form as 
not to be recognized, or else drops out of sight alto- 
gether. : 
Seemingly Useless Instincts.—Indeed it is difficult to 
see that some instincts serve a useful purpose at any 
time. The pugnacity and greediness of childhood, its 
foolish fears, the bashfulness,of youth—these seem to be 
either useless or detrimental to development. In order 
to understand the workings of instinct, however, we must 
remember that it looks in two directions; into the future 
for its application, and into the past for its explanation.
-P-A-G-E-226
    38. THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
We should not be surprised if the experiences of a ong 
past have left behind some tendencies which are not 
very useful under the vastly different conditions of 
today. 
Nor should we be too sure that an activity whose 
precise function in relation to development we cannot 
discover has no use at all. Each instinct must be con- 
sidered not alone in the light of what it means to its 
possessor today, but of what it means to all his future 
development. The tail of a polliwog seems a very use- 
less appendage so far as the adult frog is concerned, 
yet if the polliwog’s tail is cut off a perfect frog never 
develops. 
Instincts to Be Utilized When They Appear—A man 
may set the stream to turning his mill wheels today or 
wait for twenty years—the power is there ready for 
him when he wants it. Instincts must be utilized when 
they present themselves, else they disappear—never, in 
most cases, to return. Birds kept caged past the flying © 
time never learn to fly well. The hunter must train 
his setter when the time is ripe, or the dog can never 
be depended upon. Ducks kept away from the water 
until full grown have almost as little inclination for it as 
chickens. 
The child whom the pressure of circumstances or un- 
wise authority of parents keeps from mingling with 
playmates and participating in their plays and games 
when the social instinct is strong upon him, will in 
later life find himself a hopeless recluse to whom social 
duties are a bore. The boy who does not hunt and fish 
and race and climb at the proper time for these things, 
will find his taste for them fade away, and he will become 
wedded to a sedentary life. The youth and maiden must 
‘be permitted to ‘‘dress up’’ when the impulse comes to
-P-A-G-E-227
  INSTINCT 209 
them, or they are likely ever after to be careless in 
their attire. 
Instincts as Starting Points.—Most of our habits have 
their rise in instincts, and all desirable instincts should 
be seized upon and transformed into habits before they 
fade away. Says James in his remarkable chapter on 
Instinct: ‘‘In all pedagogy the great thing is to strike 
while the iron is hot, and to seize the wave of the pupils’ 
interest in each successive subject before its ebb has 
come, so that knowledge may be got and a habit of skill 
acquired—a headway of interest, in short, secured, on 
which afterwards the individual may float. There is a 
happy moment for fixing skill in drawing, for making 
boys collectors in natural history, and presently dis- 
sectors and botanists; then for initiating them into the 
harmonies of mechanics and the wonders of physical and 
chemical law. Later, introspective psychology and the 
metaphysical and religious mysteries take their turn; 
and, last of all, the drama of human affairs and worldly 
wisdom in the widest sense of the term. In each of us 
a saturation point is soon reached in all these things; the 
impetus of our purely intellectual zeal expires, and un- 
less the topic is associated with some urgent personal 
need that keeps our wits constantly whetted about it, we 
settle into an equilibrium, and live on what we learned 
when our interest was fresh and instinctive, without 
adding to the store.” 
There is a tide in the affairs of men 
Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune; 
Omitted, all the voyage of their life 
Is bound in shallows and in miseries. 
The More Important Human Instincts.—It will be im- 
possible in this brief statement to give a complete cata- 
 
-P-A-G-E-228
    210 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
logue of the human instincts, much less to discuss each 
in detail. We must content ourselves therefore with 
naming the more important instincts, and finally discuss- 
ing a few of them: Sucking, biting, chewing, clasping 
objects with the fingers, carrying to the mouth, crying, 
smiling, sitting up, standing, locomotion, vocalization, 
imitation, emulation, pugnacity, resentment, anger, sym- 
pathy, hunting and fighting, fear, acquisitiveness, play, 
curiosity, sociability, modesty, secretiveness, shame, love, 
and jealousy may be said to head the list of our instincts. 
It will be impossible in our brief space to discuss all of 
this list. Only a few of the more important will be 
noticed. 
3. THE INSTINCT OF IMITATION 
No individual enters the world with a large enough 
stock of instincts to start him doing all the things neces- 
sary for his welfare. Instinct prompts him to eat when 
he is hungry, but does not tell him to use a knife and 
fork and spoon; it prompts him to use vocal speech, but 
does not say whether he shall use English, French, or 
German; it prompts him to be social in his nature, but 
does not specify that he shall say please and thank 
you, and take off his hat to ladies. The race did not find 
the specific modes in which these and many other things 
are to be done of sufficient importance to crystallize 
them in instincts, hence the individual must learn them 
as he needs them. The simplest way of accomplishing 
this is for each generation to copy the ways of doing 
things which are followed by the older generation among 
whom they are born. This is done largely through 
imitation. 
Nature of Imitation —ZImitation is the instinct to re- 
upond to a suggestion from another by repeating his act,
-P-A-G-E-229
  INSTINCT 211 
The instinct of imitation is active in the year-old child, 
it requires another year or two to reach its height, then 
it gradually grows less marked, but continues in some 
degree throughout life. The young child is practically 
helpless in the matter of imitation. Instinct demands 
that he shall imitate, and he has no choice but to obey. 
His environment furnishes the models which he must 
imitate, whether they are good or bad. Before he is old 
enough for intelligent choice, he has imitated a multi- 
tude of acts about him; and habit has seized upon these 
acts and is weaving them into conduct and character. 
Older grown we may choose what we will imitate, but ~ 
in our earlier years we are at the mercy of the models 
which are placed before us. 
If our mother tongue is the first we hear spoken, that 
will be our language; but if we first hear Chinese, we 
will learn that with almost equal facility. If whatever 
speech we hear is well spoken, correct, and beautiful, so 
will our language be; if it is vulgar, or incorrect, or 
slangy, our speech will be of this kind. If the first, 
manners which serve us as models are coarse and boorish, 
ours will resemble them; if they are cultivated and re- 
fined, ours will be like them. If our models of conduct 
and morals are questionable, our conduct and morals 
will be of like type. Our manner of walking, of dressing, 
of thinking, of saying our prayers, even, originates in 
imitation. By imitation we adopt ready-made our social 
standards, our political faith, and our religious creeds. 
Our views of life and the values we set on its attain- 
ments are largely a matter of imitation. 
Individuality in Imitation.—Yet, given the same model, 
no two of us will imitate precisely alike. Your acts will 
be yours, and mine will be mine. This is because no two 
of us have just the same heredity, and hence cannot have  
-P-A-G-E-230
  212 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
precisely similar instincts. There reside in our dif- 
ferent personalities different powers of invention and 
originality, and these determine by how much the prod- 
uct of imitation will vary from the model. Some re- 
main imitators all their lives, while others use imitation 
as a means to the invention of better types than the 
original models. The person who is an imitator only, 
lacks individuality and initiative; the nation which is 
an imitator only is stagnant and unprogressive. While 
imitation must be blind in both cases at first, it should 
be increasingly intelligent as the individual or the nation 
progresses. 
Conscious and Unconscious Imitation—The much- 
quoted dictum that ‘‘all consciousness is motor’’ has a 
direct application to imitation. It only means that we 
have a tendency to act on whatever idea occupies the 
mind. Think of yawning or clearing the throat, and 
the tendency is strong to do these things. We naturally 
respond to smile with smile and to frown with frown. 
And even the impressions coming to us from our mate- 
rial environment have their influence on our acts. Our 
response to these ideas may be a conscious one, as when 
a boy purposely stutters in order to mimic an unfor- 
tunate companion ; or it may be unconscious, as when the 
boy unknowingly falls into the habit of stammering from 
hearing this kind of speech. The child may consciously 
seek to keep himself neat and clean so as to harmonize 
with a pleasant and well-kept home, or he may uncon- 
sciously become slovenly and cross-tempered from living 
in an ill-kept home where constant bickering is the rule. 
Often we deliberately imitate what seems to us desir- 
‘able in other people, but probably far the greater pro- 
portion of the suggestions to which we respond are 
received and acted upon unconsciously. In conscious
-P-A-G-E-231
INSTINCT 218 
  imitation we can select what models we shall imitate, and 
therefore protect ourselves in so far as our judgment of 
good and bad models is valid. In unconscious imita- 
tion, however, we are constantly responding to a stream 
of suggestions pouring in upon us hour after hour and 
day after day, with no protection but the. leadings of 
our interests as they direct our attention now to this 
phase of our environment, and now to that. 
Influence of Environment.—No small part of the influ- 
ences which mold our lives comes from our material 
environment. Good clothes, artistic homes, beautiful 
pictures and decoration, attractive parks and lawns, well- 
kept streets, well-bound books—all these have a direct 
moral and educative value; on the other hand, squalor, 
disorder, and ugliness are an incentive to ignorance and 
crime. 
Hawthorne tells in ‘‘The Great Stone Face’’ of the 
boy Ernest, listening to the tradition of a coming Wise 
Man who one day is to rule over the Valley. The story 
sinks deep into the boy’s heart, and he thinks and 
dreams of the great and good man; and as he thinks and 
dreams, he spends his boyhood days gazing across the 
valley at a distant mountain side whose rocks and cliffs 
nature had formed into the outlines of a human face re- 
markable for the nobleness and benignity of its expres- 
sion. He comes to love this Face and looks upon it as 
the prototype of the coming Wise Man, until lo! as he 
dwells upon it and dreams about it, the beautiful char-. 
acter which its expression typifies grows into his own 
life, and he himself becomes the long-looked-for Wise 
Man. 
The Influence of Personality—More powerful than the 
influence of material environment, however, is that of 
other personalities upon us—the touch of life upon life.
-P-A-G-E-232
  214 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
  A living personality contains a power which grips hold 
of us, electrifies us, inspires us, and compels us to new 
endeavor, or else degrades and debases us. None has 
failed to feel at some time this life-touch, and to bless 
or curse the day when its influence came upon him. 
Either consciously or unconsciously such a personality 
becomes our ideal and model; we idolize it, idealize it, 
and imitate it, until it becomes a part of us. Not only 
do we find these great personalities living in the flesh, 
but we find them also in books, from whose pages they 
speak to us, and to whose influence we respond. 
And not in the great personalities alone does the power 
to influence reside. From every life which touches ours, 
a stream of influence great or small is entering our life 
and helping to mold it. Nor are we to forget that this 
influence is reciprocal, and that we are reacting upon 
others up to the measure of the powers that are in us, 
4, THE INSTINCT OF PLAY 
Small use to be a child unless one can play. Says 
Karl Groos: ‘‘Perhaps the very existence of youth is 
due in part to the necessity for play; the animal does 
not play because he is young, but he is young because 
he must play.’’ Play is a constant factor in all grades 
of animal life. The swarming insects, the playful kit- 
ten, the frisking lambs, the racing colt, the darting swal- 
lows, the maddening aggregation of blackbirds—these ° 
are but illustrations of the common impulse of all the 
animal world to play. Wherever freedom and happi- 
ness reside, there play is found; wherever play is lack- 
ing, there the curse has fallen and sadness and oppres- 
sion reign. Play is the natural réle in the paradise of 
youth ; it is childhood’s chief occupation. To toil with-
-P-A-G-E-233
INSTINCT 215 
out play, places man on a level with the beasts of 
burden. 
The Necessity for Play.—But why is play so necessary ? 
Why is this impulse so deep-rooted in our natures? 
Why not compel our young to expend their boundless 
energy on productive labor? Why all this waste? Why 
have our child labor laws? Why not shut recesses from 
our schools, and so save time for work? Is it true that 
all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy? Too.true. 
For proof we need but gaze at the dull and lifeless faces 
of the prematurély old children as they pour out of the 
factories where child labor is employed. We need but 
follow the children, who have had a playless childhood, 
into a narrow and barren manhood. jWe need but to 
trace back the history of the dull and brutish men of 
today, and find that they were the playless children of 
yesterday. ~Play is as neeessary.to the child as food, 
as vital as sunshine, as indispensable as air. 
The keynote of play is freedom, freedom of physical 
activity, and mental initiative., In play the child makes 
his own plans, his imagination has free rein, originality 
is in demand, and constructive ability is placed under 
tribute. Here are developed a thousand tendencies 
which would never find expression in the narrow tread- 
mill of labor alone. The child needs to learn to work; 
but along with his work must be the opportunity for 
free and unrestricted activity, which can come only 
through play. The boy needs a chance to be a barbarian, 
a hero, an Indian. He needs to ride his broomstick 
on a dangerous raid, and to charge with lath sword the re- 
doubts of a stubborn enemy. He needs to be a leader 
as well as a)follower. In short, without in the least be- 
ing aware of it, he needs to develop himself through his 
own activity—he needs freedom to play. If the child
-P-A-G-E-234
  216 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
be a girl, there is no difference except in the character 
of the activities employed. 
Play in Development and Education.—And it is pre- 
cisely out of these play activities that the later and more 
serious activities of life emerge. Play is the gateway 
by which we best enter the various fields of the world’s 
work, whether our particular sphere be that of pupil or 
teacher in the schoolroom, of man in the busy marts of 
trade or in the professions, or of farmer or mechanic. 
Play brings the whole self into the activity; it trains to 
habits of independence and individual initiative, to 
strenuous and sustained effort, to endurance of hardship 
and fatigue, to social participation and the acceptance 
of victory and defeat. And these are the qualities 
needed by the man of success in his vocation. 
These facts make the play instinct one of the most 
important in education. Froebel was the first to recog- 
nize the importance of play, and the kindergarten was 
an attempt to utilize its activities in the school. The in- 
troduction of this new factor into education has been 
attended, as might be expected, by many mistakes. Some 
have thought to recast the entire process of education 
into the form of games and plays, and thus to lead the 
child to possess the ‘‘Promised Land’’ through aimlessly 
chasing butterflies in the pleasant fields of knowledge. 
it is needless to say that they have not succeeded. Oth- 
ers have mistaken the shadow for the substance, and 
introduced games and plays into the schoolroom which 
lack the very first element of play; namely, freedom of 
initiative and action on the part of the child. EHduca- 
tional theorists and teachers have invented games and 
occupations and taught them to the ne who go 
through with them much as they would with any other 
task, enjoying the activity but missing the development,
-P-A-G-E-235
  INSTINCT 217 
which would come through a larger measure of self- 
direction. 
Work and Play Are Complements.—Work cannot take 
the place of play, neither can play be substituted for’ 
work. Nor are the two antagonistic, but each is the 
complement of the other; for the activities of work grow 
immediately out of those of play, and each lends zest to 
the other. Those who have never learned to work and 
those who have never learned to play are equally lacking 
in their development. Further, it is not the name or 
character of an activity which determines whether it is 
play for the participant, but his attitude toward the 
activity. If the activity is performed for its own sake 
and not for some ulterior end, if it grows out of the in- 
terest of the child and involves the free and independent 
use of his powers of body and mind, if it is his, and not 
someone’s else—then the activity possesses the chief 
characteristics of play. Lacking these, it cannot be play, 
whatever else it may be. 
Play, like other instincts, besides serving the present, 
looks in two directions, into the past and into the future. 
From the past come the shadowy interests which, taking 
form from the touch of our environment, determine the 
character of the play activities. From the future come 
the premonitions of the activities that are to be. The boy 
adjusting himself to the requirements of the game, seek- 
ing control over his companions or giving in to them, is 
practicing in miniature the larger game which he will 
play in business or profession a little later. The girl in 
her playhouse, surrounded by a nondescript family of 
dolls and pets, is unconsciously looking forward to a 
more peel when the responsibilities shall be a lit- 
tle more real. So let us hot grudge our children the 
playday of youth.

  Many other instincts ripen during the stage of youth 
and play their part in the development of the individual. 
Curiosity—It is inherent in every normal person to 
want to investigate and know. The child looks out with 
wonder and fascination on a world he does not under- 
stand, and at once begins to ask questions and try experi- 
ments. Every new object is approached in a spirit of in- 
quiry. Interest is omnivorous, feeding upon every phase 
of environment. Nothing is too simple or too complex 
to demand attention and exploration, so that it vitally 
touches the child’s activities and experience. 
The momentum given the individual by curiosity to- 
ward learning and mastering his world is incalculable. 
Imagine the impossible task of teaching children what 
they had no desire or inclination to know! Think of 
trying to lead them to investigate matters concerning 
which they felt only a supreme indifference! Indeed 
one of the greatest problems of education is to keep curi- 
osity alive and fresh so that its compelling influence 
may promote effort and action. One of the greatest 
secrets of eternal youth is also found in retaining the 
spontaneous curiosity of youth after the youthful years 
are past. 
Manipulation.—This is the rather unsatisfactory name 
for the universal tendency to handle, do or make 
something. The young child builds with its blocks, con- 
structs fences and pens and caves and houses, and a 
score of other objects. The older child, supplied with 
implements and tools, enters upon more ambitious proj- 
ects and revels in the joy of creation as he makes boats 
and boxes, soldiers and swords, kites; play-houses and 
what-not. Even as adults we are moved by a desire to 
 
-P-A-G-E-237
  INSTINCT 219 
express ourselves through making or creating that which 
will represent our ingenuity and skill. The tendency 
of children to destroy is not from wantonness, but rather 
from a desire to manipulate. 
Education has but recently begun to make serious use 
of this important impulse. The success of all laboratory 
methods of teaching, and of such subjects as manual 
training and domestic science, is abundant proof of the 
adage that we learn by doing. We would rather con- 
struct or manipulate an object than merely learn its 
verbal description. Our deepest impulses lead to crea- 
_ tion rather than simple mental appropriation of facts 
and descriptions. 
The Collecting Instinct—The words my and mine 
enter the child’s vocabulary at a very early age. The 
sense of property ownership and the impulse to make 
collections of various kinds go hand in hand. Probably 
there are few of us who have not at one time or another 
made collections of autographs, postage stamps, coins, 
bugs, or some other thing of as little intrinsic value. 
And most of us, if we have left youth behind, are busy 
even now in seeking to collect fortunes, works of art, rare 
volumes or other objects on which we have set our hearts. 
The collecting instinct and the impulse to ownership 
can be made important agents in the school. The child 
who, in nature study, geography or agriculture, is mak- 
ing a collection of the leaves, plants, soils, fruits, or in- 
sects used in the lessons has an incentive to observation 
and investigation impossible from book instruction alone. 
One who, in manual training or domestic science, is al- 
lowed to own the article made will give more effort and 
skill to its construction than if the work be done as a 
mere school task. 
The Dramatic Instinct.—Every person is, at one stage 
 
-P-A-G-E-238
220 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
of his development, something of an actor. All children 
like to ‘‘dress up’’ and impersonate someone else— 
in proof of which, witness the many play scenes in which 
the character of nurse, doctor, pirate, teacher, merchant 
or explorer is taken by children who, under the stimu- 
lus of their spontaneous imagery and as yet untrammeled 
by self-consciousness, freely enter into the character they 
portray. The dramatic impulse never wholly dies out. 
‘When we no longer aspire to do the acting ourselves we 
have others do it for us in the theaters or the movies. 
Education finds in the dramatic instinct a valuable 
aid. Progressive teachers are using it freely, especially 
in the teaching of literature and history. Its application 
to these fields may be greatly increased, and also ex- 
tended more generally to include religion, morals, and 
art. 
The Impulse to Form Gangs and Clubs.—F'ew boys and 
girls grow up without belonging at some time to a secret 
gang, club or society. Usually this impulse grows out 
of two different instincts, the social and the adventurous. 
It is fundamental in our natures to wish to be with our 
kind—not only our human kind, but those of the same 
age, interests and ambitions. The love of secrecy and 
adventure is also deep seated in us. So we are clannish; 
and we love to do the unusual, to break away from the 
commonplace and routine of our lives. There is often 
a thrill of satisfaction—even if it be later followed by 
remorse—in doing the forbidden or the unconven- 
tional. 
The problem here as in the case of many other in- 
stincts is one of guidance rather than of repression. Out 
of the gang impulse we may develop our athletic teams, 
our debating and dramatic clubs, our tramping clubs, 
amd a score of other recreational, benevolent, or social
-P-A-G-E-239
  INSTINCT 221 
organizations. Not repression, but proper expression 
should be our ideal. 
6. FEAR 
Probably in no instinct more than in that of fear can 
we find the reflections of all the past ages of life in the 
world with its manifold changes, its dangers, its trage- 
dies, its sufferings, and its deaths. 
Fear Heredity.—The fears of childhood ‘‘are remem- 
bered at every step,’’ and so are the fears through which 
the race has passed. Says Chamberlain: ‘‘Every ugly 
thing told to the child, every shock, every fright given 
him, will remain like splinters in the flesh, to torture him 
all his life long. The bravest old soldier, the most dar- 
ing young reprobate, is incapable of forgetting them all 
—the masks, the bogies, ‘ogres, hobgoblins, witches, and 
wizards, the things that bite and scratch, that nip and 
tear, that pinch and crunch, the thousand and one im- 
aginary monsters of the mother, the nurse, or the serv- 
ant, have had their effect; and hundreds of generations 
have worked to denaturalize the brains of children. 
Perhaps no animal, not even those most susceptible to 
fright, has behind it the fear heredity of the child.”’ 
President Hall calls attention to the fact that night 
is now the safest time of the twenty-four hours; ser- 
pents are no longer our most deadly enemies; strangers 
are not to be feared; neither are big eyes or teeth; there 
is no adequate reason why the wind, or thunder, or light- 
ning should make children frantic as they do. But ‘‘the 
past of man forever seems to linger in his present’’; 
and the child, in being afraid of these things, is only 
summing up the fear experiences of the race and suffer- 
ing all too many of them in his short childhood. 
Fear of the Dark.—Most children are afraid in the
-P-A-G-E-240
  222 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
dark. Who does not remember the terror of a dark room 
through which he had to pass, or, worse still, in which 
he had to go to bed alone, and there lie in cold perspira- 
tion induced by a mortal agony of fright! The unused 
doors which would not lock, and through which he ex- 
pected to see the goblin come forth to get him! The 
dark shadows back under the bed where he was afraid 
to look for the hidden monster which he was sure was 
hiding there and yet dare not face! The lonely lane 
through which the cows were to be driven late at night, 
while every fence corner bristled with shapeless mon- 
sters lying in wait for boys! 
And that hated dark closet where he was shut up ‘‘un- _ 
til he could learn to be good!’’ And the useless trap- 
door in the ceiling. How often have we lain in the dim 
light at night and seen the lid lift just a peep for ogre 
eyes to peer out, and, when the terror was growing be- 
yond endurance, close down, only to lift once and again, 
until from sheer weariness and exhaustion we fell into 
a troubled sleep and dreamed of the hideous monster 
which inhabited the unused garret! Tell me that the 
old trapdoor never bent its hinges in response to either 
man or monster for twenty years? I know it is true, 
and yet I am not convinced. My childish fears have 
left a stronger impression than proof of mere facts can 
ever overrule. 
Fear of Being Left Alone.—And the fear of being left 
alone. How big and dreadful the house seemed with 
the folks all gone! How we suddenly made close friends 
with the dog or the cat, even, in order that this bit of 
life might be near us! Or, failing in this, we have gone 
out to the barn among the chickens and the pigs and the 
cows, and deserted the empty house with its torture of 
loneliness. What was there so terrible in being alone?
-P-A-G-E-241
  INSTINCT 223 
I do not know. I know only that to many children it 
is a torture more exquisite than the adult organism is 
fitted to experience. 
But why multiply the recollections? They bring a 
tremor to the strongest of us today. Who of us would 
choose to live through those childish fears again? Dream 
fears, fears of animals, fears of furry things, fears of 
ghosts and of death, dread of fatal diseases, fears of 
fire and of water, of strange persons, of storms, fears 
of things unknown and even unimagined, but all the 
more fearful! Would you all like to relive your child- 
hood for its pleasures if you had to take along with 
them its sufferings? Would the race choose to live its 
evolution over again? I do not know. But, for my own 
part, I should very much hesitate to turn the hands of 
time backward in either case. Would that the adults 
at life’s noonday, in remembering the childish fears of 
life’s morning, might feel a sympathy for the children of 
today, who are not yet escaped from the bonds of the 
fear instinct. Would that all might seek to quiet every 
foolish childish fear, instead of laughing at it or enhane- 
ing it! 
7. OTHER UNDESIRABLE INSTINCTS 
We are all provided by nature with some instincts 
which, while they may serve a good purpose in our de- 
velopment, need to be suppressed or at least modified 
when they have done their work. 
Selfishness.— All children, and perhaps all adults, are 
selfish. The little child will appropriate all the candy, 
and give none to his playmate. He will grow angry 
and fight rather than allow brother or sister to use a 
favorite plaything. He will demand the mother’s atten- 
tion and care even when told that she is tired or ill,
-P-A-G-E-242
  224 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
and not able to minister to him. But all of this is true 
to naturé and, though it needs to be changed to gener- 
osity and unselfishness, is, after all, a vital factor in our 
natures. For it is better in the long run that each one 
should look out for himself, rather than to be so care- 
less of his own interests and needs as to require help 
from others. The problem in education is so to balance 
selfishness and greed with unselfishness and generosity 
that each serves as a check and a balance to the other. 
Not elimination but equilibrium is to be our watchword. 
Pugnacity, or the Fighting Impulse——Almost every 
normal child is a natural fighter, just as every adult 
should possess the spirit of conquest. The long history 
of conflict through which our race has come has left its 
mark in our love of combat. The pugnacity of children, 
especially of boys, is not so much to be deprecated and 
suppressed as guided into right lines and rendered sub- 
ject to right ideals. The boy who picks a quarrel has 
been done a kindness when given a drubbing that will 
check this tendency. On the other hand, one who risks 
battle in defense of a weaker comrade does no ignoble 
thing. Children need very early to be taught the base- 
ness of fighting for the sake of conflict, and the glory 
of going down to defeat fighting in a righteous cause. 
The world could well stand more of this spirit among 
adults! 
Let us then hear the conclusion of the whole matter. 
The undesirable instincts do not need encouragement. It 
is better to let them fade away from disuse, or in some 
cases even by attaching punishment to their expression. 
They are echoes from a distant past, and not serviceable 
in this better present. Zhe desirable instincts we are to 
seize upon and utilize as starting points for the develop-
-P-A-G-E-243
  INSTINCT 225 
ment of useful interests, good habits, and the higher 
emotional life. We should take them as they come, for 
their appearance is a sure sign that the organism ‘is 
ready for and needs the activity they foreshadow; and, 
furthermore, if they are not used when they present 
themselves, they disappear, never to return. 
8. PROBLEMS IN OBSERVATION AND INTROSPECTION 
1. What instincts. have you noticed developing in chil- 
dren? What ones have you observed to fade away? Can you 
fix the age in both cases? Apply these questions to your own 
development. as you remember it or can get it by tradition 
from your elders. 
2. What use of imitation may be made in teaching (1) 
literature, (2) composition, (3) music, (4) good manners, (5) 
morals? 
3. Should children be taught to play? Make a list of the 
games you think all children should know and be able to play. 
It has been said that it is as important for a people to be 
able to use their leisure time wisely as to use their work time 
profitably. Why should this be true? 
4. Observe the instruction of children to discover the ex- 
tent to which use is made of the constructive instinct. The 
collecting instinct. The dramatic instinct. Describe a plan 
by which each of these instincts can be successfully used in 
some branch of study. : 
5. What examples can you recount from your own experi- 
ence of conscious imitation? of unconscious imitation? of the 
influence of environment? What is the application of the 
preceding question to the esthetic quality of our school build- 
ings? 
6. Have you ever observed that children under a dozen 
years of age usually cannot be depended upon for “team 
work” in their games? How do you explain this fact?

  CHAPTER XIV 
FEELING AND ITS FUNCTIONS 
In the psychical world as well as the physical we must 
meet and overcome inertia. Our lives must be com- 
pelled by motive forces strong enough to overcome 
this natural inertia, and enable us besides to make 
headway against many obstacles. The motive power 
that drives us consists chiefly of our feelings and emo- 
tions. Knowledge, cognition, supplies the rudder that 
guides our ship, but feeling and emotion supply the 
power. 
To convince one’s head is, therefore, not enough; his 
feelings must be stirred if you would be sure of moving 
him to action. Often have we known that a certain line 
of action was right, but failed to follow it because feeling 
led in a different direction. When decision has been 
hanging in the balance we have piled on one side obliga- 
tion, duty, sense of right, and a dozen other reasons for 
action, only to have them all outweighed by the one sin- 
gle: It is disagreeable. Judgment, reason, and experi- 
ence may unite to tell us that a contemplated course is 
unwise, and imagination may reveal to us its disastrous 
consequences, and yet its pleasures so appeal to us 
that we yield. Our feelings often prove a stronger 
motive than knowledge and will combined; they are 
a factor constantly to be reckoned with among our mo- 
tives. 
226
-P-A-G-E-245
  FEELING AND ITS FUNCTIONS 227 
1. THE NATURE OF FEELING 
It will be our purpose in the next few chapters to 
study the affective content of consciousness—the feel- 
ings and emotions. The present chapter will be devoted 
to the feelings and the one that follows to the emo- 
tions. 
The Different Feeling Qualities—At least six (some 
writers say even more) distinct and qualitatively differ- 
ent feeling states are easily distinguished. These 
are: pleasure, pain; desire, repugnance ; interest, apathy. 
Pleasure and pain, and desire and repugnance, are di- 
rectly opposite or antagonistic feelings. Interest and 
apathy are not opposites in a similar way, since apathy 
is but the absence of interest, and not its antagonist. In 
place of the terms pleasure and pain, the pleasant and 
the unpleasant, or the agreeable and the disagreeable, 
are often used. Aversion is frequently employed as a 
synonym for repugnance. 
It is somewhat hard to believe on first thought that 
feeling comprises but the classes given. For have we 
not often felt the pain from a toothache, from not being 
able to take a long-planned trip, from the loss of a dear 
friend? Surely these are very different classes of feel- 
ings! Likewise we have been happy from the very joy 
of living, from being praised for some well-doing, or 
from the presence of friend or lover. And here again 
we seem to have widely different classes of feelings. 
‘We must remember, however, that feeling is always 
based on something known. It never appears alone in 
consciousness as mere pleasures or pains. The mind 
must have something about which to feel. The ‘‘what’’ 
must precede the ‘‘how.’’ What we commonly call a 
feeling is a complex state of consciousness in which feel-  
-P-A-G-E-246
  228 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
ing predominates, but which has, nevertheless, a basis 
of sensation, or memory, or some other cognitive pro- 
cess. And what so greatly varies in the different 
eases of the illustrations just given is precisely this 
knowledge element, and not the feeling element. <A 
feeling of unpleasantness is a feeling of unpleasant- 
ness whether it comes from an aching tooth or from 
the loss of a friend. It may differ in degree, and the 
entire mental states of which the feeling is a part may 
differ vastly, but the simple feeling itself is of the same 
quality. 
Feeling Always Present in Mental Content.—No phase 
of our mental life is without the feeling element. We 
look at the rainbow with its beautiful and harmonious 
blending of colors, and a feeling of pleasure aceompanies 
the sensation; then we turn and gaze at the glaring sun, 
and a disagreeable feeling is the result. A strong feel- 
ing of pleasantness accompanies the experience of the 
voluptuous warmth of a cozy bed on a cold morning, but 
the plunge between the icy sheets on the preceding eve- 
ning was accompanied by the opposite feeling. The touch 
of a hand may occasion a thrill of ecstatic pleasure, or it 
may be accompanied by a feeling equally disagreeable. 
And so on through the whole range of sensation ; we not 
only know the various objects about us through sensa- 
tion and perception, but we also feel while we know. 
Cognition, or the knowing processes, gives us our 
“‘whats’’; and feeling, or the affective processes, gives us 
our ‘‘hows.’’ What is yonder object? A bouquet. How 
does it affect you? Pleasurably. 
If, instead of the simpler sensory processes which we 
have just considered, we take the more complex proc- 
esses, such as memory, imagination, and thinking, the 
vase is no different. Who has not reveled in the pleasure
-P-A-G-E-247
  FEELING AND ITS FUNCTIONS 229 
accompanying the memories of past joys? On the other 
hand, who is free from all unpleasant memories—from 
regrets, from pangs of remorse? Who has not dreamed 
away an hour in pleasant anticipation of some desired 
object, or spent a miserable hour in dreading some 
calamity which imagination pictured to him? Feeling 
also accompanies our thought processes. Everyone has 
experienced the feeling of the pleasure of intellectual 
victory over some difficult problem which had baffled the 
reason, or over some doubtful case in which our judg- 
ment proved correct. And likewise none has escaped 
the feeling of unpleasantness which accompanies intel- 
lectual defeat. Whatever the contents of our mental 
stream, ‘‘we find in them, everywhere present, a certain 
color of passing estimate, an immediate sense that they 
are worth something to us at any given moment, or that 
they then have an interest to us.’’ 
The Seeming Neutral Feeling Zone.—It is probable that 
there is so little feeling connected with many of the 
humdrum and habitual experiences of our everyday lives, 
that we are but slightly, if at all, aware of a feeling state 
in connection with them. Yet a state of consciousness 
with absolutely no feeling side to it is as unthinkable as 
the obverse side of a coin without the reverse. Some 
sort of feeling tone or mood is always present. The width 
of the affective neutral zone—that is, of a feeling state so 
little marked as not to be discriminated as either pleas- 
ure or pain, desire or aversion—varies with different 
persons, and with the same person at different times. 
It is conditioned largely by the amount of attention 
given in the direction of feeling, and also on the fineness 
of the power of feeling discrimination. It is safe to 
say that the zero range is usually so small as to be negli- 
gible.

  230 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
2. MOOD AND DISPOSITION 
The sum total of all the feeling accompanying the va- 
rious sensory and thought processes at any given time 
results in what we may call our feeling tone, or mood. 
How Mood is Produced.—During most of our waking 
hours, and, indeed, during our sleeping hours as well, a 
multitude of sensory currents are pouring into the cor- 
tical centers. At the present moment we can hear the 
rumblé of a wagon, the chirp of a cricket, the chatter 
of distant voices, and a hundred other sounds besides. 
At the same time the eye is appealed to by an infinite 
variety of stimuli in light, color, and objects; the skin 
responds to many contacts and temperatures; and every 
other type of end-organ of the body is acting as a 
“‘sender’’ to telegraph a message in to the brain. Add 
to these the powerful currents which are constantly 
being sent to the cortex from the visceral organs—those 
of respiration, of circulation, of digestion and assimila- 
tion. And then finally add the central processes which 
accompany the flight of images through our minds— 
our meditations, memories, and imaginations, our cogi- 
tations and volitions. 
Thus we see what a complex our feelings must be, and 
how impossible to have any moment in which some feel- 
ing is not present as a part of our mental stream. It is 
this complex, now made up chiefly on the basis of the 
sensory currents coming in from the end-organs or the 
visceral organs, and now on the basis of those in the cor- 
tex connected with our thought life, which constitutes 
the entire feeling tone, or mood. 
Mood Colors All Our Thinking.—Mood depends on the 
character of the aggregate of nerve currents entering the 
cortex, and changes as the character of the current va- 
 
-P-A-G-E-249
  FEELING AND ITS FUNCTIONS 231 
ries. If the currents run on much the same from hour 
to hour, then our mood is correspondingly constant; if 
the currents are variable, our mood also will be variable. 
Not only is mood dependent on our sensations and 
thoughts for its quality, but it in turn colors our entire 
mental life. It serves as a background or setting whose 
hue is reflected over all our thinking. Let the mood be 
somber and dark, and all the world looks gloomy ; on the 
other hand, let the mood be bright and cheerful, and 
the world puts on a smile. 
It is told of one of the early circuit riders among 
the New England ministry, that he made the following 
entries in his diary, thus well. illustrating the point: 
“‘Wed. Eve. Arrived at the home of Bro. Brown late 
this evening, hungry and tired after a long day in the - 
saddle. Had a bountiful supper of cold pork and beans, 
warm bread, bacon and eggs, coffee, and rich pastry. I 
go to rest feeling that my witness is clear; the future is 
bright; I feel called to a great and glorious work in 
this place. Bro. Brown’s family are godly people.’ 
The next entry was as follows: ‘‘Thur. Morn. Awak- 
ened late this morning after a troubled night. I am very 
much depressed in soul; the way looks dark; far from 
feeling called to work among this people, I am beginning 
to doubt the safety of my own soul. I am afraid the de- 
sires of Bro. Brown and his family are set too much 
on carnal things.’’ A dyspeptic is usually a pessimist, 
and an optimist always keeps a bright mood. 
Mood Influences Our Judgments and Decisions.—The 
prattle of children may be grateful music to our ears 
when we are in one mood, and excruciatingly discordant 
noise when we are in another. What appeals to us as a 
good practical joke one day, may seem a piece of un- 
warranted impertinence on another. A proposition 
  bh
-P-A-G-E-250
  232 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
which looks entirely plausible under the sanguine mood 
induced by a persuasive orator, may appear wholly un- 
tenable a few hours later. Decisions which seemed war- 
ranted when we were in an angry mood, often appear 
unwise or unjust when we have become more calm. Mo- 
tives which easily impel us to action when the world looks 
bright, fail to move us when the mood is somber. The 
feelings of impending peril and calamity which are an 
inevitable accompaniment of the ‘‘blues,’’ are speedily 
dissipated when the sun breaks through the clouds and 
we are ourselves again. 
Mood Influences Effort.—A bright and hopeful mood 
quickens every power and enhances every effort, while a 
hopeless mood limits power and cripples effort. The 
football team which goes into the game discouraged 
never. plays to the limit. The student who attacks his 
lesson under the conviction of defeat can hardly hope to 
succeed, while the one who enters upon his work confi- 
dent of his power to master it has the battle already half 
won. The world’s best work is done not by those who 
live in the shadow of discouragement and doubt, but by 
those in whose breast hope springs eternal. The optimist 
is a benefactor of the race if for no other reason than 
the sheer contagion of his hopeful spirit; the pessimist 
contributes neither to the world’s welfare nor its hap- 
piness. Youth’s proverbial enthusiasm and dauntless 
energy rest upon the supreme hopefulness which char- 
acterizes the mood of the young. For these reasons, if 
for no other, the mood of the schoolroom should be one 
of happiness and good cheer. 
Disposition a Resultant of Moods——The sum total of 
our moods gives us our disposition. Whether these are 
pleasant or unpleasant, cheerful or gloomy, will depend 
on the predominating character of the moods which en-
-P-A-G-E-251
  _-_FEELING AND ITS FUNCTIONS 233 
ter into them. As well expect to gather grapes of thorns 
or figs of thistles, as to secure a desirable disposition 
out of undesirable moods. A sunny disposition never 
comes from gloomy moods, nor a hopeful one out of the 
“‘blues.’’ And it is our disposition, more than the power 
of our reason, which, after all, determines our desira- 
bility as friends and companions. 
The person of surly disposition can hardly make a de- 
sirable companion, no matter what his intellectual quali- 
ties may be. Wemay live very happily with one who 
cannot follow the reasoning of a Newton, but it is hard 
to live with a person chronically subject to ‘‘black 
moods.’’ Nor can we put the responsibility for our dis- 
position off on our ancestors. It is not an inheri- 
tance, but a growth. Slowly, day by day, and mood 
by mood, we build up our disposition until finally it 
comes to characterize us. 
Temperament.—Some are, however, more predisposed 
to certain types of mood than are others. The organi- 
zation of our nervous system which we get through 
heredity undoubtedly has much to do with the feeling 
tone into which we most easily fall. We call this pre- 
disposition temperament. On the effects of tempera- 
ment, our ancestors must divide the responsibility with 
us. I say divide the responsibility, for even if we find 
ourselves predisposed toward a certain undesirable type 
of moods, there is no reason why we should give up to 
them. Even in spite of hereditary predispositions, we 
ean still largely determine for ourselves what our moods 
are to be. 
If we have a tendency toward cheerful, quiet, and op- 
timistic moods, the psychologist names our’temperament 
the sanguine; if we are tense, easily excited and irritable, 
with a tendency toward sullen or angry moods, the 
 
-P-A-G-E-252
  234 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
choleric; if we are given to frequent fits of the ‘‘blues,”’ 
if we usually look on the dark side of things and have 
a tendency toward moods of discouragement and the 
“‘dumps,’’ the melancholic; if hard to rouse, and given 
to indolent and indifferent moods, the phlegmatic. 
‘Whatever be our temperament, it is one of the most im- 
portant factors in our character. 
3. PERMANENT FEELING ATTITUDES, OR SENTIMENTS 
Besides the more or less transitory feeling states which 
we have called moods, there exists also a class of feeling 
attitudes, which contain more of the complex intellectual 
element, are withal of rather a higher nature, and much 
more permanent than our moods. We may call these 
our sentiments, or attitudes. Our sentiments comprise 
the somewhat constant level of feeling combined with 
cognition, which we name sympathy, friendship, love, 
patriotism, religious faith, selfishness, pride, vanity, etc. 
Like our dispositions, our sentiments are a growth of 
months and years. Unlike our dispositions, however, 
our sentiments are relatively independent of the physio- 
logical undertone, and depend more largely upon long- 
continued experience and intellectual elements as a basis. 
A sluggish liver might throw us into an irritable mood 
and, if the condition were long continued, might result 
in a surly disposition; but it would hardly permanently 
destroy one’s patriotism and make him turn traitor to 
his country. One’s feeling attitude on such matters is 
too deep seated to be modified by changing whims. 
How Sentiments Develop—Sentiments have their be- 
ginning in concrete experiences in which feeling is a 
predominant element, and grow through the multipli- 
eation of these experiences much as the concept is de-
-P-A-G-E-253
i 
FEELING AND ITS FUNCTIONS 235 
veloped through many percepts. There is a residual ele- 
ment left behind each separate experience in both cases. 
In the case of the concept the residual element is intel- 
lectual, and in the case of the sentiment it is a complex 
in which the feeling element is predominant. 
How this comes about is easily seen by means of an 
illustration or two. The mother feeds her child when 
he is hungry, and an agreeable feeling is produced; she 
* puts him into the bath and snuggles him in her arms, 
and the experiences are pleasant. The child comes to 
look upon the mother as one whose especial function is 
to make things pleasant for him, so he comes to be happy 
in her presence, and long for her in her absence. He 
finally grows to love his mother not alone for the count- 
less times she has given him pleasure, but for what she 
herself is. The feelings connected at first wholly with 
pleasant experiences coming through the ministrations 
of the mother, strengthened no doubt by instinctive tend- 
encies toward affection, and later enhanced by a fuller 
realization of what a mother’s care and sacrifice mean, 
grow at last into a deep, forceful, abiding sentiment of 
love for the mother. 
The Effect: of Experience.—Likewise with the sentiment 
of patriotism. In so far as our patriotism is a true pa- 
triotism and not a noisy clamor, it had its rise in feelings 
of gratitude and love when we contemplated the deeds 
of heroism and sacrifice for the flag, and the blessings 
which come to us from our relations as citizens to our 
country. If we have had concrete cases brought to our 
experience, as, for example, our property saved from 
destruction at the hands of a mob or our lives saved 
from a hostile foreign foe, the patriotic sentiment will 
be all the stronger. 
So we may carry the illustration into all the senti-   
 
-P-A-G-E-254
  236 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
' 
ments. Our religious sentiments of adoration, love, and 
faith have their origin in our belief in the care, love, 
and support from a higher Being typified to us as 
children by the care, love, and support of our parents. 
Pride arises from the appreciation or over-appreciation 
of oneself, his attainments, or his belongings. Selfishness 
has its genesis in the many instances in which pleasure 
results from ministering to self. In all these eases it 
is seen that our sentiments develop out of our experi- 
ences: they are the permanent but ever-growing results 
which we have to show for experiences which are some- 
what long continued, and in which a certain feeling qual- 
ity is a strong accompaniment of the cognitive part of 
the experience. 
The Influence of Sentiment.—Our sentiments, like our 
dispositions, are not only a natural growth from the 
experiences upon which they are fed, but they in turn 
have large influence in determining the direction of 
our further development. Our sentiments furnish the 
soil which is either favorable or hostile to the growth of 
new experiences. One in whom the sentiment of true 
patriotism is deep-rooted will find it much harder to re- 
spond to a suggestion to betray his country’s honor on 
battlefield, in legislative hall, or in private life, than one 
Jacking in this sentiment. The boy who has a strong 
sentiment of love for his mother will find this a restrain- 
ing influence in the face of temptation to commit deeds 
which would wound her feelings. A deep and abiding 
faith in God is fatal to the growth of pessimism, dis- 
trust, and a self-centered life. One’s sentiments are a 
safe gauge of his character. Let us know a man’s atti- 
tude or sentiments on religion, morality, friendship, 
honesty, and the other great questions of life, and little 
remains to be known. If he is right on these, he may
-P-A-G-E-255
  FEELING AND ITS FUNCTIONS 237 
well be trusted in other things; if he is wrong on these, 
there is little to build upon. 
Literature has drawn its best inspiration and choicest 
themes from the field of our sentiments. The sentiment 
of friendship has given us our David and Jonathan, our 
Damon and Pythias, and our Tennyson and Hallam. 
The sentiment of love has inspired countless master- 
pieces; without its aid most of our fiction would lose its 
plot, and most of our poetry its charm. Religious sen- 
timent inspired Milton to write the world’s greatest epic, 
‘*Paradise Lost.’’ The sentiment of patriotism has fur- 
nished an inexhaustible theme for the writer and the 
orator. Likewise if we go into the field of music 
and art, we find that the best efforts of the masters 
are clustered around some human sentiment which has 
appealed to them, and which they have immortalized 
by expressing it on canvas or in marble, that it may 
appeal to others and cause the sentiment to grow in 
us. 
Sentiments as Motives—The sentiments furnish the 
deepest, the most constant, and the most powerful mo- 
tives which control our lives. Such sentiments as pa- 
triotism, liberty, and religion have called a thousand 
armies to struggle and die on ten thousand battlefields, 
and have given martyrs courage to suffer in the fires of 
persecution. Sentiments of friendship and love have 
prompted countless deeds of self-sacrifice and loving de- 
votion. Sentiments of envy, pride, and jealousy have 
changed the boundary lines of nations, and have 
prompted the committing of ten thousand unnamable 
crimes. Slowly day by day from the cradle to the grave 
we are weaving into our lives the threads of sentiment, 
which at last become so many cables to bind us to good or 
evil.

4. PROBLEMS IN OBSERVATION AND INTROSPECTION 
1. Are you subject to the “blues,” or other forms of de- 
pressed feeling? Are your moods very changeable, or rather 
constant? What kind of a disposition do you think you 
have? How did you come by it; that is, in how far is it due 
to hereditary temperament, and in how far to your daily 
moods? 
2. Can you recall an instance in which some undesirable 
mood was caused by your physical condition? By some dis- 
turbing mental condition? What is your characteristie mood 
in the morning after sleeping in an ill-ventilated room? After 
sitting for half a day in an ill-ventilated schoolroom? After 
eating indigestible food before going to bed? 
3. Observe a number of children or your classmates closely 
and see whether you can determine the characteristic mood of 
each. Observe several different schools and see whether you 
ean note a characteristic mood for each room. - Try to deter- 
mine the causes producing the differences noted. (Physical 
conditions in the room, personality of the teacher, methods of 
governing, teaching, etc.) 
4. When can you do your best work, when you are happy, 
or unhappy? Cheerful, or “blue”? Confident and hopeful, or 
discouraged? In a spirit of harmony and codperation with 
your teacher, or antagonistic? Now relate your conclusions 
to the type of atmosphere that should prevail in the school- 
room or the home. Formulate a statement as to why the 
“spirit” of the school is all-important. (Effect on effort, 
‘growth, disposition, sentiments, character, ete.) 
5. Can you measure more or less accurately the extent to 
which your feelings serve as motives in your life? Are feel- 
ings alone a safe guide to action? Make a list of the impor- 
tant sentiments that should be cultivated in youth. Now show 
how the work of the school may be used to strengthen worthy 
sentiments.

  CHAPTER XV 
THE EMOTIONS 
FEELING and emotion are not to be looked upon as two 
different kinds of mental processes. In fact, emotion is 
but a feeling state of a high degree of intensity and com- 
plexity. Emotion transcends the-simpler feeling states 
whenever the exciting cause is sufficient to throw us out 
of our regular routine of affective experience. The dis- 
tinction between emotion and feeling is a purely arbi- 
trary one, since the difference is only one of complexity 
and degree, and many feelings may rise to the intensity 
of emotions. A feeling of sadness on hearing of 2 num- 
ber of fatalities in a railway accident may suddenly 
become an emotion of grief if we learn that a member 
of our family is among those killed. A feeling of glad- 
ness may develop into an emotion of joy, or a feeling 
of resentment be kindled into an emotion of rage. 
1, THE PRODUCING AND EXPRESSING OF EMOTION 
Nowhere more than in connection with our emotions 
are the close inter-relations of mind and body seen. All 
are familiar with the fact that the emotion of anger 
tends to find expression in the blow, love in the caress, 
fear in flight, and so on. But just how our organism 
acts in producing an emotion is less generally under- 
stood. Professor James and Professor Lange have 
shown us that emotion not only tends to produce some 
239
-P-A-G-E-258
  240 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
characteristic form of response, but that the emotion 
is itself caused by certain deep-seated physiological re- 
actions. Let us seek to understand this statement a lit- 
tle more fully. 
Physiological Explanation of Emotion—We must re- 
member first of all that all changes in mental states are 
accompanied by corresponding physiological changes. 
Hard, concentrated thinking quickens the heart beat; 
keen attention is accompanied by muscular tension; cer- 
tain sights or sounds increase the rate of breathing; of- 
fensive odors produce nausea, and so on. So complete 
and perfect is the response of our physical organism to 
mental changes that one psychologist declares it possible, 
had we sufficiently delicate apparatus, to measure the 
reactions caused throughout the body of a sleeping child 
by the shadow from a passing cloud falling upon the 
closed eyelids. 
The order of the entire event resulting in an emotion 
is as follows: (1) Something is known; some object en- 
ters consciousness coming either from immediate per- 
ception or through memory or imagination. This fact, 
or thing known, must be of such nature that it will, (2) 
set up deep-seated and characteristic organic response; 
(3) the feeling accompanying and caused by by these physi- 
ological reactions constitutes the emotion» For exam- 
ple, we may be passing along the street in a perfectly 
calm and equable state of mind, when we come upon.a 
teamster who is brutally beating an exhausted horse be- 
cause it is unable to draw an overloaded wagon up a 
slippery incline. The facts grasped as we take in the 
‘situation constitute the first element in an emotional re- 
sponse developing in our consciousness. But instantly 
our muscles begin to grow tense, the heart beat and 
breath quicken, the face takes on a different expression,
-P-A-G-E-259
  ®HE EMOTIONS 241 
the hands clench—the entire organism is reacting to the 
disturbing situation ; the second factor in the rising emo- 
tion, the physiological response, thus appears. Along 
with our apprehension of the cruelty and the or- 
ganie disturbances which result we feel waves of in- 
-dignation and anger surging through us. This is the 
third factor in the emotional event, or the emotion it- 
self. In some such way as this are all of our emotions 
aroused. 
Origin of Characteristic Emotional Reactions.—Why do 
certain facts or objects of consciousness always cause 
certain characteristic organic responses? 
In order to solve this problem we shall have first to go 
beyond the individual and appeal to the history of the 
race. What the race has found serviceable, the individ- 
ual repeats. But even then it is hard to see why the 
particular type of physical response such as shrinking, 
‘pallor, and trembling, which naturally follow stimuli 
threatening harm, should be the best. It is easy to see, 
however, that the feeling which prompts to flight or 
serves to deter from harm’s way might be useful. It is 
plain that there is an advantage in the tense muscle, the 
set teeth, the held breath, and the quickened pulse which 
accompany the emotion of anger, and also in the feel- 
ing of anger itself, which prompts to the conflict. But 
even if we are not able in every case to determine at 
this day why all the instinctive responses and their 
correlate of feeling were the best for the life of the 
race, we may be sure that such was the case; for Na- 
ture is inexorable in her dictates that only that shall 
persist which has proved serviceable in the largest num- 
ber of cases. 
An interesting question arises at this point as to why 
we feel emotion accompanying some of our motor re-  
-P-A-G-E-260
      
          
  242 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
    sponses, and not others. Perceptions are crowding in 
upon us hour after hour; memory, thought, and imagi- 
nation are in constant play ; and a continuous motor dis- 
charge results each moment in physical expressions great 
or small. Yet, in spite of these facts, feeling which is 
strong enough to rise to an emotion is only an occasional 
thing. If emotion accompanies any form of physical 
expression, why not all? Let us see whether we can 
discover any reason. One day I saw a boy leading a dog 
along the street. All at once the dog slipped the string 
over its head and ran away. The boy stood looking after 
the dog for a moment, and then burst into a fit of rage. 
What all had happened? The moment before the dog 
broke away everything was running smoothly in the ex- 
perience of the boy. There was no obstruction to his 
thought or his plans. Then in an instant the situation 
changes. The smooth flow of experience is checked and 
baffled. The discharge of nerve currents which meant 
thought, plans, action, is blocked. A crisis has arisen 
which requires readjustment. The nerve currents must 
flow in new directions, giving new thought, new plans, 
new activities—the dog must be recaptured. It is in 
connection with this damming up of nerve currents 
from following their wonted channels that the emo- 
-tion emerges. Or, putting it into mental terms, 
the emotion occurs when the ordinary current of 
our thought is violently disturbed—when we meet with 
some crisis which necessitates a readjustment of our 
thought relations and plans, either temporarily or -per- 
manently. 
The Duration of an Emotion.—If the required read- 
justment is but temporary, then the emotion is short- 
lived, while if the readjustment is necessarily of longer 
duration, the emotion also will live longer. The fear
-P-A-G-E-261
  THE EMOTIONS 243 
which follows the thunder is relatively brief; for the 
shock is gone in a moment, and our thought is but tem- 
porarily disturbed. If the impending danger is one that 
persists, however, as of some secret assassin threatening 
our life, the fear also will persist. The grief of a child 
over the loss of someone dear to him is comparatively 
short, because the current of the child’s life has not been 
so closely bound up in a complexity of experiences with 
the lost object as in the case of an older person, and 
hence the readjustment is easier. The grief of an adult 
over the loss of a very dear friend lasts long, for’ the 
object grieved over has so become a part of the bereaved 
one’s experience that the loss requires a very complete 
readjustment of the whole life. In either case, however, 
as this readjustment is accomplished the emotion grad- 
ually fades away. 
Emotions Accompanying Crises in Experience.—If our 
description of the feelings has been correct, it will be 
seen that the simpler and milder feelings are for the 
common run of our everyday experience; they are the 
common valuers of our thought and acts from hour to 
hour. The emotions, or more intense feeling states, are, 
however, the occasional high tide of feeling which oc- 
\eurs in crises or emergencies. We are angry on some 
particular provocation, we fear some extraordinary fac- 
tor in our environment, we are joyful over some unusual 
good fortune. 
2. THE CONTROL OF EMOTIONS 
Dependence on Expression.—Since all emotions rest 
upon some form of physical or physiological expression 
primarily, and upon some thought back of this sec- 
ondarily, it follows that the first step in controlling an
-P-A-G-E-262
  244 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
| emotion is to secure the removal of the state of conscious- 
ness which serves as its basis. This may be done, for 
instance, with a child, either by banishing the terrifying 
dog from his presence, or by convincing him that the 
dog is harmless. The motor response will then cease, and 
the emotion pass away. If the thought is persistent, 
however, through the continuance of its stimulus, then 
what remains is to seek to control the physical expres- 
sion, and in that way suppress the emotion. If, instead 
of the knit brow, the tense muscles, the quickened heart 
beat, and all the deeper organic changes which go along 
with these, we can keep a smile on the face, the muscles 
relaxed, the heart beat steady, and a normal condition in 
all the other organs, we shall have no cause to fear an 
explosion of anger. If we are afraid of mice and feel an 
almost irresistible tendency to mount a chair every time 
we see a mouse, we can do wonders in suppressing the 
fear by resolutely refusing. to give expression to these 
_ tendencies. Inhibition of the expression inevitably 
means the death of the emotion. 
This fact has its bad side as well as its good in the 
feeling life, for it means that good emotions as well 
as bad will fade out if we fail to allow them expression. 
We are all perfectly familiar with the fact in our own 
experience that an interest which does not find means 
of expression soon passes away. Sympathy unexpressed 
ere long passes over into indifference. Even love can- 
not live without expression. Religious emotion which 
does not go out in deeds of service cannot persist. The 
natural end and. aim of our emotions is to serve as mo- 
tives to activity; and missing this opportunity, they 
have not only failed in their office, but will themselves 
die of inaction. 
Relief through Expression Emotional states not only
-P-A-G-E-263
  
  THE EMOTIONS 245 
have their rise in organic reactions, but they also tend 
to result in acts. When we are angry, or in love, or in 
fear, we have the impulse to do something about it. And, 
while it is true that emotion may be inhibited by sup- 
pressing the physical expressions on which it is founded, 
so may a state of emotional tension be relieved by some 
forms of expression. None have failed to experience 
the relief which comes to the overcharged nervous sys- 
tem from a good ery. There is no sorrow so bitter as a 
dry sorrow, when one cannot weep. A state of anger 
or annoyance is relieved by an explosion of some kind, 
whether in a blow or its equivalent in speech. We often 
feel better when we have told a man ‘‘what we think of 
him.’’ 
At first glance this all seems opposed to what we have 
been laying down as the explanation of emotion. Yet it 
is not so if we look well into the case. We have already 
seen that emotion occurs when there is a blocking of 
the usual pathways of discharge for the nerve currents, 
which must then seek new outlets, and thus result in 
the setting up of new motor responses. In the case of 
grief, for example, there is a disturbance in the whole 
organism ; the heart beat is deranged, the blood pressure 
diminished, and the nerve tone lowered. What is needed 
is for the currents which are finding an outlet in direc- 
tions resulting in these particular responses to find a 
pathway of discharge which will not produce such deep- 
seated results. This may be found in erying. The en- 
ergy thus expended is diverted from producing internal 
disturbances. Likewise, the explosion in anger may 
serve to restore the equilibrium of disturbed nerve cur- 
rents. : 
Relief Does Not Follow if Image is Held Before the 
Mind.—All this is true, however, only when the expres-
-P-A-G-E-264
  
  246 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
sion does not serve to keep the idea before the mind 
which was originally responsible for the emotion. A 
person may work himself into a passion of anger by be- 
ginning to talk about an insult and, as he grows increas- 
ingly violent, bringing the situation more and more 
sharply into his consciousness. The effect of terrifying 
‘images is easily to be observed in the case of one’s start- 
ing to run when he is afraid after night. There is prob- 
ably no doubt that the running would relieve his fear 
providing he could do it and not picture the threatening 
something as pursuing him. But, with his imagination 
conjuring up dire images of frightful catastrophes at 
every step, all control is lost and fresh waves of terror 
surge over the shrinking soul. 
Growing Tendency toward Emotional Control Among 
civilized peoples there is a constantly growing tendency 
toward emotional control. Primitive races express grief, 
joy, fear, or anger much more freely than do civilized 
races. This does not mean that primitive man feels 
more deeply than civilized man; for, as we have already 
seen, the crying, laughing, or blustering is but a small 
part of the whole physical expression, and one’s entire 
organism may be stirred to its depths without any of 
these outward manifestations. Man has found it ad- 
visable as he has advanced in civilization not to reveal 
all he feels to those around him. The face, which is the 
most expressive part of the body, has come to be under 
such perfect control that it is hard to read through it the 
emotional state, although the face of civilized man is 
capable of expressing far more than is that of the sav- 
age. The same difference is observable between the child 
and the adult. The child reveals each passing shade of 
emotion through his expression, while the adult may feel 
much that he does not show.

  TH MOTIONS 247 
3. CULTIVATION OF THE EMOTIONS 
There is no other mental factor which has more to 
do with the enjoyment we get out of life than our feel- 
ings and emotions. 
The Emotions and Enjoyment.—Few of us would care 
to live at all, if all feeling were eliminated from human 
experience.. True, feeling often makes us suffer; but in 
so far as life’s joys triumph over its woes, do our feelings 
minister to our enjoyment. Without sympathy, love, 
and appreciation, life would be barren indeed. More- 
over, it is only through our own emotional experience 
that we are able to interpret the feeling side of the lives 
about us. Failing in this, we miss one of the most sig- 
nificant phases of social experience, and are left with our 
own sympathies undeveloped and our life by so much 
impoverished. 
The interpretation of the subtler emotions of those 
about us is in no small degree an art. The human face 
and form present a constantly changing panorama of 
the soul’s feeling states to those who can read their signs. 
The ability to read the finer feelings, which reveal 
themselves in expression too delicate to be read by the 
eye of the gross or unsympathetic observer, lies at the 
basis of all fine interpretation of personality. Feelings 
are often too deep for outward expression, and we are 
slow to reveal our deepest selves to those who cannot ap- 
preciate and understand them. 
How Emotions Develop.—Emotions are to be cultivated 
as the intellect or the muscles are to be cultivated; 
namely, through proper exercise. Our thought is to 
dwell on those things to which proper emotions attach, 
and to shun lines which would suggest emotions of an 
undesirable type: Emotions which are to be developed
-P-A-G-E-266
  248 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
must, as has already been said, find expression; we must 
act in response to their leadings, else they become but 
idle vaporings. If love prompts us to say a kind word 
to a suffering fellow mortal, the word must be spoken 
or the feeling itself fades away. On the other hand, 
the emotions which we wish to suppress are to be re- 
fused expression. The unkind and cutting word is to 
be left unsaid when we are angry, and the fear of things 
which are harmless left unexpressed and thereby doomed 
to die. 
The Emotional Factor in Our Environment.—Much ma- 
terial for the ‘cultivation of our emotions lies in the 
everyday life all about us if we can but interpret it. Few 
indeed of those whom we meet daily but are hungering 
for appreciation and sympathy. Lovable traits exist 
in every character, and will reveal themselves to the one 
who looks for them. Miscarriages of justice abound on 
all sides, and demand our indignation and wrath and 
the effort to right the wrong. Evil always exists to be 
hated and suppressed, and dangers to be feared and 
avoided. Human life and the movement of human af- 
fairs constantly appeal to the feeling side of our nature 
if we understand at all what life and action mean. 
.A certain blindness exists in many people, however, 
which makes our own little joys, or sorrows, or fears 
the most remarkable ones in the world, and keeps us 
from realizing that others may feel as deeply as we. 
Of course this self-centered attitude of mind is fatal 
to any true cultivation of the emotions. It leads to an 
emotional life which lacks not only breadth and depth, 
but also perspective. 
Literature and the Cultivation of the Emotions.—In 
order to increase our facility in the interpretation of the 
emotions through teaching us what to look for in life
-P-A-G-E-267
  THE EMOTIONS 249 
and experience, we may go to literature. Here we find. 
life interpreted for us in the ideal by masters of inter- 
pretation; and, looking through their eyes, we see new 
depths and breadths of feeling which we had never be- 
fore discovered. { Indeed, literature deals far more in 
the aggregate with the feeling side than with any other 
aspect of human life., And it is just this which makes 
literature a universal language, for the language of our 
emotions is more easily interpreted than that of our 
reason. The smile, the cry, the laugh, the frown, the 
caress, are understood all around the world among all 
peoples. They are universal. 
There is always this danger to be avoided, however. 
We may become so taken up with the overwrought de- 
scriptions of the emotions as found in literature or on 
the stage that the common humdrum of everyday life 
around us seems flat and stale. The interpretation of the 
writer or the actor is far beyond what we are able to 
make for ourselves, so we take their interpretation 
rather than trouble ourselves to look in our own environ- 
ment for the material which might appeal to our emo- 
tions. It is not rare to find those who easily weep over 
the woes of an imaginary person in a book or on the 
stage unable to feel sympathy for the real suffering 
which exists all around them. The story is told of a 
lady at the theater who wept over the suffering of the 
hero in the play; and at the moment she was shedding 
the unnecessary tears, her own coachman, whom she had 
compelled to wait for her in the street, was frozen to 
death. Our seemingly prosaic environment is full of 
suggestions to the emotional life, and books and plays 
should only help to develop in us the power rightly to 
respond to these suggestions. 
Harm in Emotional Overexcitement.—Danger may ex- 
 
-P-A-G-E-268
    250 THE MIND. AND ITS EDUCATION 
ist also in still another line; namely, that of emotional 
overexcitement. There is a great nervous strain in high 
emotional tension. Nothing is more exhausting than a 
severe fit of anger; it leaves its victim weak and limp. 
A severe case of fright often incapacitates one for men- 
tal or physical labor for hours, or it may even result in 
permanent injury. (The whole nervous tone is distinctly 
lowered by sorrow, and even excessive joy may be harm- 
ful. 
In our actual, everyday life, there is little danger from 
emotional overexcitement unless it be in the case of fear 
in children, as was shown in the discussion on instincts, 
and in that of grief over the loss of objects that are dear 
to us. Most of our childish fears we could just as well 
avoid if our elders were wiser in the matter of guarding 
us against those that are unnecessary. The griefs we 
cannot hope to escape, although we can do much to con- 
trol them. Long-continued emotional excitement, un- 
less it is followed by corresponding activity, gives us 
those who weep over the wrongs of humanity, but never 
do anything to right them; who are sorry to the point 
of death over human suffering, but cannot be induced to 
lend their aid to its alleviation. We could very well 
spare a thousand of those in the world who merely feel, 
for one who acts, James tells us. 
‘We should watch, then, that our good feelings do not 
simply evaporate as feelings, but that they find some 
place to apply themselves to accomplish good; that we 
do not, like Hamlet, rave over wrongs which need to 
be righted, but never bring ourselves to the point where 
we take a hand in their righting. YTf our emotional life 
is to be rich and deep in its feeling and effective in its 
results on our acts and character, it must firfd its outlet 
in deeds.  
-P-A-G-E-269
THE EMOTIONS 
  4. EMOTIONS AS MOTIVES 
Emotion is always dynamic, and our feelings consti- 
tute our strongest motives to action and achievement. 
How Our Emotions Compel Us.—Love has often done 
in the reformation of a fallen life what strength of will 
was not able to accomplish; it has caused dynasties to 
fall, and has changed the map of nations. Hatred is 
a motive hardly less strong. Fear will make savage 
| beasts out of men who fall under its sway, causing them 
to trample helpless women and children under feet, 
whom in their saner moments they would protect with 
their lives. Anger puts out all the light of reason, and 
prompts peaceful and well-meaning men to commit mur- 
derous acts. 
Thus feeling, from the faintest and simplest feeling of 
interest, the various ranges of pleasures and pain, the 
sentiments which underlie all our lives, and so on to the 
mighty emotions which grip our lives with an overpow- 
ering strength, constitutes a large part of the motive 
power which is constantly urging us on to do and dare. 
Hence it is important from this standpoint, also, that we 
should have the right type of feelings and emotions well 
developed, and the undesirable ones éliminated. 
Emotional Habits—Emotion and feeling are partly 
matters of habit. That is, we can form emotional as well 
as other habits, and they are as hard to break. Anger 
allowed to run uncontrolled leads into habits of angry 
outbursts, while the one who habitually controls his tem- 
per finds it submitting to the habit: of remaining within 
bounds. One may cultivate the habit of showing his 
fear on all occasions, or of discouraging its expression. 
He may form the habit of jealousy or of confidence. It 
is possible even to form the habit of falling in love, or
-P-A-G-E-270
252 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
  of so suppressing the tender emotions that love finds 
little opportunity for expression. 
And here, as elsewhere, habits are formed through 
performing the acts upon which the habit rests. If there 
are emotional habits we are desirous of forming, what 
we have to do is to indulge the emotional expression of 
the type we desire, and the habit will follow. If we wish 
to form the habit of living in a chronic state of the 
blues, then all we have to do is to be blue and act blue 
sufficiently, and this form of emotional expression will 
become a part of us. If we desire to form the habit of 
living in a happy, cheerful state, we can accomplish this 
by encouraging the corresponding expression. 
5. PROBLEMS IN OBSERVATION AND INTROSPECTION 
1. What are the characteristic bodily expressions by which 
you can recognize a state of anger? Fear? Jealousy? Ha- 
tred? Love? Grief? Do you know persons who are in- 
clined to be too expressive emotionally? Who show too little 
emotional expression? How would you classify yourself in 
this respect? 
2. Are you naturally responsive to the emotional tone of 
others; that is, are you sympathetic? Are you easily affected 
by reading emotional books? By emotional plays or other 
appeals? What is the danger from overexciting the emotions 
without giving them a proper outlet in some practical ac- 
tivity? 
3. Have you observed a tendency among adults not to 
take seriously the emotions of a child; for example, to look 
upon childish grief as trivial, or fear as something to be 
laughed at? Is the child’s emotional life as real as that of the 
adult® (See Ch. IX, Betts, “Fathers and Mothers.”) 
4. Have you known children to repress their emotions for 
fear of being laughed at? Have you known parents or 
others to remark about childish love affairs to the children
-P-A-G-E-271
  THE EMOTIONS 253 
themselves in a light or joking way? Ought this ever to be 
done? 
5. Note certain children who give way to fits of anger; 
what is the remedy? Note other children who ery readily; 
what would you suggest as a cure? (Why should ridicule not 
be used?) 
6. Have you observed any teacher using the lesson in liter- 
ature or history to cultivate the finer emotions? What emo- 
tions have you seen appealed to by a lesson in nature study? 
What emotions have you observed on the playground that 
needed restraint? Do you think that on the whole the emo- 
tional life of the child receives enough consideration in the 
school? In the home?

CHAPTER XVI 
INTEREST 
Tue feeling that we call interest is so important a me- 
tive in our lives and so colors our acts and gives direction 
to our endeavors that we will do well to devote a chap- 
ter to its discussion. 
1. THE NATURE OF INTEREST 
We saw in an earlier chapter that personal habits have 
their rise in race habits or instincts. Let us now see 
how interest helps the individual to select from his in- 
stinctive acts those which are useful to build into per- 
sonal habits. Instinct impartially starts the child in the 
performance of many different activities, but does not 
dictate what particular acts shall be retained to serve as 
the basis for habits. Interest comes in at this point and 
says, ‘This act is of more value than that act; continue 
this act and drop that.’’ Instinct prompts the babe to 
countless movements of body and limb. Interest picks 
out those that are most vitally connected with the wel- 
fare of the organism, and the child comes to prefer these 
rather than the others. Thus it is that out of the random 
movements of arms and legs and head and body we 
finally develop the codrdinated activities which are in- 
finitely more useful than the random ones were. And 
these activities, originating in instincts, and selected by _ 
interest, are soon crystallized into habits. 
254
-P-A-G-E-273
  INTEREST 255 
Interest a Selective Agent.—The same truth holds for 
mental activities as for physical. A thousand channels 
lie open for your stream of thought at this moment, but 
your interest has beckoned it into the one particular 
channel which, for the time, at least, appears to be of the 
greatest subjective value; and it is now following that 
channel unless your will has compelled it to leave that 
for another. Your thinking as naturally follows your 
interest as the needle does the magnet, hence your 
thought activities are conditioned largely by your in- 
terests. This is equivalent to saying that your mental 
habits rest back finally upon your interests. 
Everyone knows what it is to be interested ; but inter- 
est, like other elementary states of consciousness, cannot 
be rigidly defined. (1) Subjectively considered, interest 
may be looked upon as a feeling attitude which assigns 
our activities their place in a subjective scale of values, 
and hence selects among them. (2) Objectively consid- 
ered, an interest is the object which calls forth .the 
feeling. (8) Functionally considered, interest is the 
dynamic phase of consciousness. 
Interest Supplies a Subjective Scale of Values.—If you 
are interested in driving a horse rather than in riding 
a bicycle, it is because the former has a greater subjec- 
tive value to you than the latter. If you are interested 
in reading these words instead of thinking about the 
next social function or the last picnic party, it is because 
at this moment the thought suggested appeals to you as 
of more value than the other lines of thought. From 
this it follows that your standards of values are revealed 
in the character of your interests. The young man who 
is interested in the race track, in gaming, and in low 
resorts confesses by the fact that these things occupy 
a high place among the things which appeal to him as 
 
-P-A-G-E-274
  256 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
subjectively valuable. The mother whose interests are 
chiefly in clubs and other social organizations places 
these higher in her scale of values than her home. The 
reader who can become interested only in light, trashy 
literature must admit that matter of this type ranks 
higher in his subjective scale of values than the works 
of the masters. Teachers and students whose strongest 
interest is in grade marks value these more highly than 
true attainment. For, whatever may be our claims or 
assertions, interest is finally an infallible barometer of 
the values we assign to our activities. 
In the case of some of our feelings it is not always 
possible to ascribe an objective side to them. A feeling 
of ennui, of impending evil, or of bounding vivacity, 
may be produced by an unanalyzable complex of causes. 
But interest, while it is related primarily to the activi- 
ties of the self, is carried over from the activity to the 
object which occasions the activity. That is, interest has 
both an objective and a subjective side. On the subjec- 
tive side a certain activity connected with self-expression 
is worth so much; on the objective side a certain object is 
worth so much as related to this self-expression. Thus 
we say, I have an interest in books or in business; my 
daily activities, my self-expression, are governed with 
reference to these objects. They are my interests. 
Interest Dynamic.—Many of our milder feelings ter- 
minate within ourselves, never attaining sufficient force 
as motives to impel us to action. Not so with interest. 
Its very nature is dynamic. Whatever it seizes upon 
becomes ipso facto an object for some activity, for some 
form of expression of the self. Are we interested in 
a new book, we must read it; in a new invention, we 
must see it, handle it, test it; in some vocation or avoca- 
tion, we must pursue it. Interest is impulsive. It gives
-P-A-G-E-275
  INTEREST 257 
its possessor no opportunity for lethargic rest and quiet, 
but constantly urges him to action. Grown ardent, in- 
terest becomes enthusiasm, ‘‘ without which,’’ says Em- 
erson, ‘‘nothing great was ever accomplished.’? Are we 
an Edison, with a strong interest centered in mechan- 
ical invention, it will drive us day and night in a cease- 
less activity which scarcely gives us time for food and 
sleep. Are we a Lincoln, with an undying interest in 
the Union, this motive will make possible superhuman 
' efforts for the accomplishment of our end. Are we man 
or woman anywhere, in any walk of life, so we are domi- 
nated by mighty interests grown into enthusiasm for 
some object, we shall find great purposes growing within 
us, and our life will be one of activity and achievement. 
On the contrary, a life which has developed no great 
interest lacks motive power. Of necessity such a life 
must be devoid of purpose and hence barren of results, 
counting little while it is being lived, and little missed 
by the world when it is gone. 
Habit Antagonistic to Interest—While, as we have 
seen, interest is necessary to the formation of habits, yet 
habits once formed are antagonistic to interest. That 
is, acts which are so habitually performed that they 
“‘do themselves’? are accompanied by a minimum of 
interest. They come to be done without attentive con- 
sciousness, hence interest cannot attach to their per- 
formance. Many of the activities which make up the 
daily round of our lives are of this kind. As long as 
habit is being modified in some degree, as long as we 
are improving in our ways of doing things, interest will 
still cling to the process; but let us once settle into an 
unmodified rut, and interest quickly fades away. We 
then have the conditions present which make of us either 
a machine or a drudge.
-P-A-G-E-276
  258 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
2. DIRECT AND INDIRECT INTEREST 
‘We may have an interest either (1) in the doing of an 
act, or (2) in the end sought through the doing. In the 
first instance we call the interest immediate or direct; 
in the second instance, mediate or indirect. 
Interest in the End versus Interest in the Activity —If 
we do not find an interest in the doing of our work, or 
if it has become positively disagreeable so that we 
loathe its performance, then there must be some ultimate 
end for which the task is being performed, and in which 
there is a strong interest, else the whole process will be 
the veriest drudgery. If the end is sufficiently interest- 
ing it may serve to throw a halo of interest over the 
whole process connected with it. The following instance 
illustrates this fact: 
A twelve-year-old boy was told by his father that if 
he would make the body of an automobile at his bench 
in the manual training school, the father would purchase 
the running gear for it and give the machine to the boy. 
In order to secure the coveted prize, the boy had to mas- 
ter the arithmetic necessary for making the calculations, 
and the drawing necessary for making the plans to scale 
before the teacher in manual training would allow him to 
take up the work of construction. The boy had always 
lacked interest in both arithmetic and drawing, and con- 
sequently was dull in them. Under the new incentive, 
however, he took hold of them with such avidity that he 
soon surpassed all the remainder of the class, and was 
able to make his calculations and drawings within a 
term. He secured his automobile a few months later, 
and still retained his interest in arithmetic and drawing. 
Indirect Interest as a Motive.—Interest of the indirect 
type, which does not attach to the process, but comes
-P-A-G-E-277
  INTEREST 259 
from some more or less distant end, most of us find much . 
less potent than interest which is immediate. This is 
especially true unless the end be one of intense desire 
and not too distant. The assurance to a boy that he 
must get his lessons well because he will need to be an 
educated man ten years hence when he goes into busi- 
ness for himself does not compensate for the lack of in- 
terest in the lessons of today. 
Yet it is necessary in the economy of life that both 
children and adults should learn to work under the in- 
citement of indirect interests. Much of the work we 
do is for an end which is more desirable than the work 
itself. It will always be necessary to sacrifice present 
pleasure for future good. Ability to work cheerfully 
for a somewhat distant end saves much of our work from 
becoming drudgery. If interest is removed from both 
the process and the end, no inducement is left to work 
except compulsion; and this, if continued, results in 
the lowest type of effort. It puts a man on a level with 
the beast of burden, which constantly shirks its work. 
Indirect Interest Alone Insufficient.—Interest coming 
from an end instead of inhering in the process may 
finally lead to an interest in the work itself; but if it does 
not, the worker is in danger of being left a drudge at 
last. To be more than a slave to his work one must 
ultimately find the work worth doing for its own sake: 
The man who performs his work solely because he has 
a wife and babies at home will never be an artist in his 
trade or profession; the student who masters a subject 
only because he must know it for an examination is not 
developing the traits of a scholar. The question of in- 
terest in the process makes the difference between the 
one who works because he loves to work and the one who 
toils because he must—it makes the difference between
-P-A-G-E-278
  260 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
the artist and the drudge. The drudge does only what 
he must when, he works, the artist all he can. The 
drudge longs for the end of labor, the artist for it to be- 
gin. The drudge studies how he may escape his labor, 
the artist how he may better his and ennoble it. 
To labor when there is joy in the work is elevating, to 
labor under the lash of compulsion is degrading. It mat- 
ters not so much what a man’s occupation as how it is 
performed. A coachman driving his team down the 
crowded street better than anyone else could do it, and 
glorying in that fact, may be a true artist in his oceu- 
pation, and be ennobled through his work. A states- 
man molding the affairs of a nation as no one else could 
do it, or a scholar leading the thought of his generation 
is subject to the same law; in order to give the best grade 
of service of which he is capable, man must find a joy 
in the performance of the work as well as in the end 
sought through its performance. No matter how high 
the position or how refined the work, the worker becomes 
a slave to his labor unless interest in its performance 
saves him. 
3. TRANSITORINESS OF CERTAIN INTERESTS 
Since our interests are always connected with our ac- 
tivities it follows that many interests will have their 
birth, grow to full strength, and then fade away as the 
corresponding instincts which are responsible for the ac- 
tivities pass through these same stages. This only means 
that interest in play develops at the time when the play 
activities are seeking expression; that interest in the 
opposite sex becomes strong when instinctive tendencies 
are directing the attention to the choice of a mate; and 
that interest in abstract studies comes when the develop-
-P-A-G-E-279
  INTEREST 261 
ment of the brain enables us to carry on logical trains of 
thought. All of us can recall many interests which 
were once strong, and are now weak or else have alto- 
gether passed away. Hide-and-seek, Pussy-wants-a-cor- 
ner, excursions to the little fishing pond, securing the 
colored chromo at school, the care of pets, reading blood- 
and-thunder stories or sentimental ones—interest in 
these things belongs to our past, or has left but a faint 
shadow. Other interests have come, and these in turn 
will also disappear and other new ones yet appear as 
long as we keep on acquiring new experience. 
Interests Must Be Utilized When They Appear.—This 
means that we must take advantage of interests when 
they appear if we wish to utilize and develop them. 
How many people there are who at one time felt an in- 
terest impelling them to cultivate their taste for music, 
art, or literature and said they would do this at some 
convenient season, and finally found themselves without 
a taste for these things! How many of us have felt an 
interest in some benevolent work, but at last discovered 
that our inclination had died before we found time to 
help the cause! How many of us, young as we are, do 
not at this moment lament the passing of some interest 
from our lives, or are now watching the dying of some 
interest which we had fondly supposed was as stable 
as Gibraltar? The drawings of every interest which 
appeals to us is a voice crying, ‘‘Now is the appointed 
time!’’ What impulse urges us today to become or to do, 
we must begin at once to be or perform, if we would 
attain to the coveted end. 
The Value of a Strong Interest—Nor are we to look 
upon these transitory interests as useless. They come 
to us not only as a race heritage, but they impel us to 
activities which are immediately useful, or else prepare
-P-A-G-E-280
  262 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
us for the later battles of life. But even aside from 
this important fact it is worth everything just to be in- 
terested. For it is only through the impulsion of in- 
terest that we first learn to put forth effort in any true 
sense of the word, and interest furnishes the final foun- 
dation upon which volition rests. Without interest the 
greatest powers may slumber in us unawakened, and 
abilities capable of the highest attainment rest satisfied 
with commonplace mediocrity. No one will ever know 
how many Gladstones'and Leibnitzes the world has lost 
simply because their interests were never appealed to 
in such a way as to start them on the road to achieve- 
ment. It matters less what the interest be, so it be not 
bad, than that there shall be some great interest to 
compel endeavor, test the strength of endurance, and 
lead to habits of achievement. 
4, SELECTION AMONG OUR INTERESTS 
I said early in the discussion that interest is selective 
among our activities, picking out those which appear 
to be of the most value to us. In the same manner there 
must be a selection among our interests themselves. 
The Mistake of Following Too Many Interests.—It is 
possible for us to become interested in so many lines of 
activity that we do none of them well. This leads to a 
life so full of hurry and stress that we forget life in our 
busy living. Says James with respect to the necessity 
of making a choice among our interests: 
“With most objects of desire, physical nature re- 
stricts our choice to but one of many represented goods, 
and even so it is here. I am often confronted by the 
necessity of standing by one of my empirical selves and 
relinquishing the rest. Not that I would not, if I could,
-P-A-G-E-281
  INTEREST 263 
be both handsome and fat, and well dressed, and a great 
- athlete, and make a million a year; be a wit, a bon vi- 
vant, and a lady-killer, as well as a philosopher ; a phi- 
lanthropist, statesman, warrior, and African explorer, as 
well as a ‘tone poet’ and saint. But the thing is sim- 
ply impossible. The millionaire’s work would run coun- 
ter to the saint’s; the bon vivant and the philosopher 
and the lady-killer could not well keep house in the same 
tenement of clay. Such different characters may con- 
ceivably at the outset of life be alike possible to man. 
But to make any one of them actual, the rest must more 
or less be suppressed. The seeker of his truest, strong- 
est, deepest self must review the list carefully, and pick 
out the one on which to stake his salvation.’’ 
Interests May Be Too Narrow.—On the other hand, it 
is just as possible for our interests to be too narrow 
as too broad. The one who has cultivated no interests 
outside of his daily round of humdrum activities does 
not get enough out of life. It is possible to become so 
engrossed with making a living that we forget to live—to 
become so habituated to some narrow treadmill of labor 
with the limited field of thought suggested by its en- 
vironment, that we miss the richest experiences of life. 
Many there are who live a barren, trivial, and self-cen- 
tered life because they fail to see the significant and the 
beautiful which lie just beyond where their interests 
reach! Many there are so taken up with their own petty 
troubles that they have no heart or sympathy for fel- 
low humanity! Many there are so absorbed with their 
own little achievements that they fail to catch step 
with the progress of the age! 
Specialization Should Not Come Too Early.—It is not 
well to specialize too early in our interests. We miss 
too many rich fields which lie ready for the harvesting,
-P-A-G-E-282
  264 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
and whose gleaning would enrich our lives. The student 
who is so buried in books that he has no time for ath- 
letic recreations or social diversions is making a mistake 
equally with the one who is so enthusiastic an athlete and 
social devotee that he neglects his studies. Likewise, 
the youth who is so taken up with the study of one par- 
ticular line that he applies himself to this at the ex- 
pense of all other lines is inviting a distorted growth. 
Youth is the time for pushing the sky line back on all 
sides; it is the time for cultivating diverse and varied 
lines of interests if we would grow into a rich experience 
in our later lives. The physical must be developed, but 
not at the expense of the mental, and vice versa. The 
social must not be neglected, but it must not be indulged 
to such an extent that other interests suffer. Interest in, 
amusements and recreations should be cultivated, but 
these should never run counter to the moral and re- 
ligious. 
Specialization is necessary, but specialization in our 
interests should rest upon a broad field of fundamental 
interests, in order that the selection of the special line 
may be an intelligent one, and that our specialty shall 
not prove a rut in which we become so deeply buried that 
we are lost to the best in life. 
A Proper Balance to Be Sought.—It behooves us, then, 
to find a proper balance in cultivating our interests, 
making them neither too broad nor too narrow. We 
should deliberately seek to discover those which are 
strong enough to point the way to a life vocation, but 
this should not be done until we have had an oppor- 
tunity to become acquainted with various lines of inter- 
ests. Otherwise our decision in this important matter 
may be based merely on a whim. 
We should also decide what interests we should culti-
-P-A-G-E-283
  INTEREST 265 
vate for our own personal development and happiness, 
and for the service we are to render in a sphere outside 
our immediate vocation. We should consider avocations 
as well as vocations. Whatever interests are selected 
should be carried to efficiency. Better a reasonable 
number of carefully selected interests well developed 
and resulting in efficiency than a multitude of interests 
which lead us into so many fields that we can at best get 
but a smattering of each, and that by neglecting the 
things which should mean the most to us. Our interests 
should lead us to live what Wagner calls a ‘‘simple life,’”’ 
but not a narrow one. 
5. INTEREST FUNDAMENTAL IN EDUCATION 
Some educators have feared that in finding our 
occupations interesting, we shall lose all power of ef- 
fort and self-direction; that the will, not being called 
sufficiently into requisition, must suffer from non-use ; 
that we shall come to do the interesting and agree- 
able things well enough, but fail before the disagree- 
able. 
Interest Not Antagonistic to Effort.—The best develop- 
ment of the will does not come through our being forced 
to do acts in which there is absolutely no interest. Work 
done under compulsion never secures the full self in its 
performance. It is done mechanically and usually under 
such a spirit of rebellion on the part of the-doer, that 
the advantage of such training may well be doubted. 
Nor are we safe in assuming that tasks done without in- 
terest as the motive are always performed under the 
direction of the will. It is far more likely that they 
are done under some external compulsion, and that the 
will has, after all, but very little to do with it. A boy
-P-A-G-E-284
    266 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
may get an uninteresting lesson at school without much 
pressure from his will, providing he is sufficiently afraid 
of the master. In order that the will may receive train- 
ing through compelling the performance of certain acts, 
it must have a reasonably free field, with external pres- 
sure removed. The compelling force must come from 
within, and not from without. 
On the other hand, there is not the least danger that 
we shall ever find a place in life where all the disagree- 
able is removed, and all phases of our work made smooth 
and interesting. The necessity will always be rising to 
eall upon effort to take up the fight and hold us to duty 
where interest has failed. And it is just here that there 
must be no failure, else we shall be mere creatures of cir- 
cumstance, drifting with every eddy in the tide of our 
life, and never able to breast the current. Interest is not 
to supplant the necessity for stern and strenuous en- 
deavor but rather to call forth the largest measure of 
endeavor of which the self is capable. It is to put at 
work a larger amount of power than can be secured in 
any other way; in place of supplanting the will, it is to 
give it its point of departure and render its service all 
the more effective. 
Interest and Character—Finally, we are not to forget 
that bad interests have the same propulsive power as 
good ones, and will lead to acts just as surely. And 
these acts will just as readily be formed into habits. It 
is worth noticing that back of the act lies an interest; 
in the act lies the seed of a habit; ahead of the act lies 
behavior, which grows into conduct, this into character, 
and character into destiny. Bad interests should be 
shunned and discouraged. But even that is not enough. 
Good interests must be installed in the place of the bad 
ones from which we wish to escape, for it is through
-P-A-G-E-285
  INTEREST . 267 
substitution rather than suppression that we are able 
to break from the bad and adhere to the good. ~ 
Our interests are an evolution. Out of the simple in- 
terests of the child grow the more complex interests of 
the man. Lacking the opportunity to develop the inter- 
ests of childhood, the man will come somewhat short of 
the full interests of manhood. The great thing, then, 
in educating a child is to discover the fundamental in- 
terests which come to him from the race and, using these 
as a starting point, direct them into constantly broaden- 
ing and more serviceable ones. Out of the early interest 
in play is to come the later interest in work; out of the 
early interest in collecting treasure boxes full of worth- 
less trinkets and old scraps comes the later interest in 
earning and retaining ownership of property; out of 
the interest in chums and playmates come the larger 
social interests; out of interest in nature comes the in- 
terest of the naturalist. And so one by one we may ex- 
amine the interests which bear the largest fruit in our 
adult life, and we find that they all have their roots in 
some early interest of childhood, which was encouraged 
and given a chance to grow. 
6. ORDER OF DEVELOPMENT OF OUR INTERESTS 
~The order in which our interests develop thus becomes 
an important question in our education. Nor is the order 
an arbitrary one, as might appear on first thought; for 
interest follows the invariable law of attaching to the 
activity for which the organism is at that time ready, 
and which it then needs in its further growth. That we 
are sometimes interested in harmful things does not dis- 
’ prove this assertion. The interest in its fundamental as- 
pect is good, and but needs more healthful environment
-P-A-G-E-286
    268 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
or more wise direction. While space forbids a fuli dis- 
cussion of the genetic phase of interest here, yet we may 
profit by a brief statement of the fundamental interests 
of certain well-marked periods in our development. 
The Interests of Early Childhood.—The interests of 
early childhood are chiefly connected with ministering 
to the wants of the organism as expressed in the appe- 
tites, and in securing control of the larger muscles. Ac- 
tivity is the preéminent thing—racing and romping are 
worth doing for their own sake alone. Imitation is 
strong, curiosity is rising, and imagination is building 
a new world. Speech is a joy, language is learned with 
ease, and rhyme and rhythm become second nature. The 
interests of this stage are still very direct and immedi- 
ate. A distant end does not attract. The thing must 
be worth doing for the sake of the doing. Since the 
young child’s life is so full of action, and since it is out 
of acts that habits grow, it is doubly desirous during this 
period that environment, models, and teaching should all 
direct his interests and activities into lines that will lead 
to permanent values. 
The Interests of Later Childhood.—In the period from 
second dentition to puberty there is a great widening in 
the scope of interests, as well as a noticeable change in 
their character. Activity is still the keynote; but the 
child is no longer interested merely in the doing, but is 
now able to look forward to the end sought. Interests 
which are somewhat indirect now appeal to him, and 
the how of things attracts his attention. He is beginning 
to reach outside of his own little circle, and is ready 
for handicraft, reading, history, and science. Spelling, 
writing, and arithmetic interest him partly from the ac- 
tivities involved, but more as a means to an end. 
Interest in complex games and plays increases, but the 
   
-P-A-G-E-287

child is not yet ready for games which require team 
work. He has not come to the point where he is willing 
to sacrifice himself for the good of all. Interest in moral 
questions is beginning, and right and wrong are no 
longer things which may or may not be done without re- 
buke or punishment. The great problem at this stage is 
to direct the interest into ways of adapting the means 
to ends and into willingness to work under voluntary at- 
tention for the accomplishment of the desired end. 
The Interests of Adolescence.—Finally, with the advent 
of puberty, comes the last stage in the development of 
interests before adult life. This period is not marked by 
the birth of new interests so much as by a deepening and 
broadening of those already begun. The end sought be- 
comes an increasingly larger factor, whether in play or 
in work. Mere activity itself no longer satisfies. The 
youth can now play team games; for his social interests 
are taking shape, and he can subordinate himself for the 
good of the group. Interest in the opposite sex takes on 
a new phase, and social form and mode of dress receive 
attention. A new consciousness of self emerges, and the 
youth becomes introspective. Questions of the ultimate 
meaning of things press for solution, and what and who 
am I, demands an answer. 
At this age we pass from a régime of obedience to one 
of self-control, from an ethics of authority to one of 
individualism. All the interests are now taking on a 
more definite and stable form, and are looking seriously 
toward life vocations. This is a time of big plans and 
strenuous activity. It is a crucial period in our life, 
fraught with pitfalls and dangers, with privileges and 
opportunities. At this strategic point in our life’s voy- 
age we may anchor ourselves with right interests to a 
safe manhood and a successful career; or we may, with    
-P-A-G-E-288
  270 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
wrong interests, bind ourselves to a broken life of dis- 
couragement and defeat. 
7. PROBLEMS IN OBSERVATION AND INTROSPECTION 
1. Try making a list of your most important interests in 
order of their strength. Suppose you had made such a list 
five years ago, where would it have differed from the present 
list? Are you ‘ever obliged to perform any activities in 
which you have little or no interest, either directly or indi- 
rectly? Can you name any activities in which you once had 
a strong interest but which you now perform chiefly from 
force of habit and without much interest? 
2. Have you any interests of which you are not proud? 
On the other hand, do you lack certain interests which you 
feel that you should possess? What interests are you now 
trying especially to cultivate? To suppress? Have you as 
broad a, field of interests as you can well take care of? Have 
you so many interests that you are slighting the development 
of some of the more important ones? 
3. Observe several recitations for differences in the amount 
of interest shown. Account for these differences. Have you 
ever observed an enthusiastic teacher with an uninterested 
class? A. dull, listless teacher with an interested class? 
4. <A father offers his son a dollar for every grade on his 
term report which is above ninety; what type of interest rela- 
tive to studies does this appeal to? What do you think of the 
advisability of giving prizes in connection with school work? 
5. Most children in the elementary school are not inter- 
ested in technical grammar; why not? Histories made up 
chiefly of dates and lists of kings or presidents are not inter- 
esting; what is the remedy? Would you call any teaching of 
literature, history, geography, or science successful which fails 
to develop an interest in the subject? 
6. After careful observation, make a statement of the dif- 
ferences in the typical play interests of boys and girls; of 
children of the third grade and the eighth grade.

  CHAPTER XVII 
THE WILL 
Tue fundamental fact in all ranges of life from the 
lowest to the highest is activity, doing. Every individ- 
ual, either animal or man, is constantly meeting situa- 
tions which demand response. In the lower forms of life, 
this response is very simple, while in the higher forms, 
and especially in man, it is very complex. The bird sees 
a nook favorable for a nest, and at once appropriates it ; 
a man sees a house that strikes his fancy, and works and 
plans and saves for months to secure money with which 
to buy it. It is evident that the larger the possible 
number of responses, and the greater their diversity and 
complexity, the more difficult it will be to select and com- 
pel the right response to any given situation. Man 
therefore needs some special power of control over his 
acts—he requires a will. 
1. THE NATURE OF THE WILL 
There has been much discussion and not a little con- 
troversy as to the true nature of the will. Just what is 
the will, and what is the content of our mental stream 
when we are in the act of willing? Is there at such times 
a new and distinctly different content which we do not 
find in our processes of knowledge or emotion—such as 
perception, memory, judgment, interest, desire? Or do 
we find, when we are engaged in an act of the will, that 
271
-P-A-G-E-290
  272 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
the mental stream contains only the familiar old ele- 
ments of attention, perception, judgment, desire, pur- 
pose, ete., all organized or set for the purpose of accom- 
plishing or preventing some act? 
The Content of the Will_—We shall not attempt here 
to settle the controversy suggested by the foregoing ques- 
tions, nor, for immediately practical purposes, do we 
need to settle it. It is perhaps safe to say, however, that 
whenever we are willing the mental content consists of 
elements of cognition and feeling plus a distinct sense 
of effort, with which everyone‘is familiar. Whether this 
sense of effort is a new and different element, or only a 
complex of old and familiar mental processes, we need 
not now decide. 
The Function of the Will.—Concerning the function of 
the will there can be no haziness or doubt. Volition 
concerns itself wholly with acts, responses. (The will al- 
ways has to do with causing or inhibiting some action, 
either physical or mental. We need to go to the dentist, 
tell some friend we were in the wrong, hold our mind to 
a difficult or uninteresting task, or do some other dis- 
agreeable thing from which we shirk. It is at such 
points that we must call upon the will. 
Again, we must restrain our tongue from speaking 
the unkind word, keep from crying out when the dentist 
drills the tooth, check some unworthy line of thought. 
‘We must here also appeal to the will. We may conclude 
then that the will is {needed whenever the physical or 
mental activity must be controlled with effort, Some 
writers have called the work of the will in compelling 
action its positive function, and in inhibiting action its 
negative function. : 
How the Will Exerts Its Compulsion.—How does the 
will bring its compulsion to bear? It is not a kind of
-P-A-G-E-291
  THE WILL 273 
mental policeman who can take us by the collar, so to 
speak, and say do this, or do not do that. The secret of 
the will’s power of control lies in attention. It is the 
line of action that we hold the mind upon with an atti- 
tude of intending to perform it that we finally follow. 
It is the thing we keep thinking about that we finally do. 
On the other hand, let us resolutely hold the mind 
away from some attractive but unsuitable line of action, 
directing our thoughts to an opposite course, or to some 
wholly different subject, and we have effectually blocked 
the wrong response. To control our acts is therefore to 
control our thoughts, and strength of will can be meas- 
ured by our ability to direct our attention. 
2. THE EXTENT OF VOLUNTARY CONTROL OVER OUR 
ACTS 
A relatively small proportion of our acts, or re- 
sponses, are controlled by volition. Nature, in her wise 
economy, has provided a simpler and easier method than 
to have all our actions performed or checked with con- 
scious effort. 
Classes of Acts or Response.—Movements or acts, like 
other phenomena, do not just happen. They never oc- 
cur without a cause back of them. Whether they are 
performed with a conscious end in view or without it, 
the fact remains the same—something must lie back of 
the act to account for its performance. During the 
last hour, each of us has performed many simple move- 
ments and more or less complex acts. These acts have 
varied greatly in character. Of many we were wholly 
unconscious. Others were consciously performed, but 
without feeling of effort on our part. Still others were 
accomplished only with effort, and after a struggle to
-P-A-G-E-292
  274 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION * 
decide which of two lines of action we should take. 
Some of our acts were reflex, some were chiefly instine- 
tive, and some were volitional. 
Simple Reflex Acts.—First, there are going on within 
every living organism countless movements of which he 
is in large part unconscious, which he does nothing to 
initiate, and which he is largely powerless to prevent. 
Some of them are wholly, and others almost, out of the 
reach and power of his will. at are the movements 
of the heart and vascular-system, the action-of-thetungs 
in breathing, the movements of the digestive tract, the 
work of the various glands in their process-of secretion. 
The entire organism is a mass 0 
just because it is living no part of 
Movements of this type require living matter, and 
it is at rest. 
no external stimulus 
and no direction, they-are-reflex; they take care of them- 
selves, as long as the body is in health, without let 
or hindrance, continuing whether we sleep or wake, 
even if we are in hypnotic or anesthetic coma. With 
movements of reflex type we sal have no more con- 
cern, since they are almost wholly physiological, and 
come scarcely at all within the range of the conscious- 
» ness. 
Instinctive Acts.—Next there are a large number of 
such acts as closing the eyes when they are threatened, 
starting back from danger, crying out from pain or 
alarm, frowning and striking when angry. These may 
roughly be classed as instinctive, and have already been 
discussed under that head. They differ from the former 
class in that they require some stimulus | to set the act 
off. We are fully conscious of their performance, al- 
though they are performed without a conscious end_in 
view. Winking the eyes serves fr   an important purpose, 
but that is not why we wink; starting back from danger
-P-A-G-E-293
  THE WILL 275 
is a wise thing to do, but we do not stop to consider this 
before performing the act. 
And so it is with a multitude of reflex and instinctive 
acts. They are performed immediately upon receiving 
an appropriate stimulus, because we possess an organism 
calculated to act in a definite way in response to certain 
stimuli. There is no need for, and indeed no place for, 
anything to come in between the stimulus and the act. 
The stimulus pulls the trigger of the ready-set nervous 
system, and the act follows at once. Acts of these reflex 
and instinctive types do not come properly within the 
range of volition, hence we will not consider them fur- 
ther. 
Automatic or Spontaneous Acts.—Growing out of these 
reflex and instinctive acts is a broad field of action which 
may be called automatic or spontaneous. The distin- 
guishing feature of this type of action is that all such 
acts, though performed now largely without conscious 
purpose or intent, were at one timepurposed acts, per- 
formed with effort; this is to say that they were voli- 
tional. Such acts as writing, or fingering the keyboard 
of a piano, were once consciously purposed, volitional 
acts selected from many random or reflex movements. 
The effects of experience and habit are such, however, 
that soon the mere presence of pencil and paper, or the 
sight of the keyboard, is enough to set one scribbling or 
playing. Stated differently, certain objects and situa- 
tions come to suggest certain characteristic acts or re- 
sponses so strongly that the action follows immediately 
on the heels of the percept of the object, or, the idea of 
the act. James calls such action ideo-motor. Many il- 
lustrations of this type of acts will occur to each of us: 
_A door starts to blow shut, and we spring up and avert 
the slam. The memory of a neglected engagement comes
-P-A-G-E-294
  276 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
to us, and we have started to our feet on the instant. 
A dish of nuts stands before us, and we find ourselves 
nibbling without intending to do so. 
The Cycle from Volitional to Automatic.—It is of 
course evident that no such acts, though they were at one 
Fic. 19.—Star for mirror drawing. The mirror breaks up the auto- 
matic control previously developed, and requires one to start out 
much as the child does at the beginning. See text for directions. 
time in our experience volitional, now require effort or 
definite intention for their performance. The law cov- 
ering this point may be stated as follows: All voli- 
tional acts, when repeated, tend, through the effects of 
habit, to become automatic, and thus relieve the will 
from the necessity of directing them. 
To illustrate this law try the following experiment:
-P-A-G-E-295
  THE WILL 277 
Draw on a piece of cardboard a star, like figure 19, mak- 
ing each line segment two inches. Seat yourself at a 
table with the star before you, placing a mirror back of 
the star so that it can be seen in the mirror. Have some- 
one hold a screen a few inches above the table so as to 
hide the star from your direct view, but so that you can 
see it in the mirror. Now reach your hand under the 
sereen and trace with a pencil around the star from left 
to right, not taking your pencil off the paper until you 
get clear around. Keep track of how long it takes to go 
around and also note the. irregular wanderings of your 
pencil. Try this experiment five times over, noting the 
decrease in time and effort required, and the increase 
in efficiency as the movements tend to become automatic. 
Volitional Action.—While it is obvious that the various 
types of action already described include a very large 
proportion of all our acts, yet they do not include all. 
For there are some acts that are neither reflex nor in- 
stinetive nor automatic, but that have to be performed 
under the stress of compulsion and effort. We con- 
stantly meet situations where the necessity for action or 
restraint runs counter to our inclinations. We daily are 
confronted by the necessity of making decisions in which 
the mind must be compelled by effort to take this diree- 
tion or that direction. Conflicting motives or tendencies 
create frequent necessity for coercion. It is often neces- 
sary to drive our bark counter to the current of our de- 
sires or our habits, or to enter into conflict with a tempta- 
tion. 
Volition Acts in the Making of Decisions,—Everyone 
knows for himself the state of inward unrest which we 
eall indecision. A thought enters the mind which would 
of itself prompt an act; but before the act can occur, 
a contrary idea appears and the act is checked ; another
-P-A-G-E-296
  278 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
thought comes favoring the act, and is in turn counter- 
balanced by an opposing one. The impelling and inhib- 
iting ideas we call motives or reasons for and against 
the proposed act. While we are balancing the motives 
against each other, we are said to deliberate. This proc- 
ess of deliberation must go on, if we continue to think 
about the matter at all, until one set of ideas has tri- 
umphed over the other and secured the attention. When 
this has occurred, we have decided, and the deliberation 
isat anend. We have exercised the highest function of 
the will and made a choice. 
Sometimes the battle of motives is short, the decision 
being reached as.soon as there is time to summon all the 
reasons on both sides of the question. At other times 
the conflict may go on at intervals for days or weeks, 
neither set of motives being strong enough to vanquish 
the other and dictate the decision. When the motives 
are somewhat evenly balanced we wisely pause in mak- 
ing a decision, because when one line of action is taken, 
the other cannot be, and we hesitate to lose either oppor- 
tunity. A state of indecision is usually highly unpleas- 
ant, and no doubt more than one decision has been has- 
tened in our lives simply that we might be done with 
the unpleasantness attendant on the consideration of two 
contrary and insistent sets of motives. 
It is of the highest importance when making a fee 
sion of any consequence that we should be fair in con- 
sidering all the reasons on both sides of the question, 
allowing each its just weight. Nor is this as easy as it 
might appear; for, as we saw in our study of the emo- 
tions, our feeling attitude toward any object that occu- 
pies the mind is largely responsible for the subjective 
value we place upon it. It is easy to be so prejudiced 
toward or against a line of action that the motives bear-
-P-A-G-E-297
  THE WILL 279 
ing upon it cannot get fair consideration. To be able 
to eliminate this personal factor to such an extent that 
the evidence before us on a question may be considered 
on its merits is a rare accomplishment. 
Types of Decision—A decision may be reached in a 
variety of ways, the most important ones of which may 
now briefly be described after the general plan suggested 
by Professor James: 
The Reasonable Type.—One of the simplest types of 
decision is that in which the preponderance of motives 
is clearly seen to be on one side or the other, and the 
only rational thing to do is to decide in accordance with 
the weight of evidence. Decisions of this type are called 
reasonable. If we discover ten reasons why we should 
pursue a certain course of action, and only one or 
two reasons of equal weight why we should not, then 
the decision ought not to be hard to make. The points 
to watch in this case are (a) that we have really dis- 
covered all the important reasons on both sides of the 
ease, and (b) that our fectings of personal interest or 
prejudice have not given some of the motives an undue 
weight in our seale of values. 
Accidental type: External Motives.—It is to be doubted 
whether as many of our decisions are made under im- 
mediate stress of volition as we think. We may be hesi- 
tating between two sets of motives, unable to decide be- 
tween them, when a third factor enters which is not 
really related to the question at all, but which finally dic- 
tates the decision nevertheless. For example, we are 
considering the question whether we shall go on an ex- 
eursion or stay at home and complete a piece of work. 
The benefits coming from the recreation, and the pleas- 
ures of the trip, are pitted against the expense which 
must be incurred and the desirability of having the work
-P-A-G-E-298
  280 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
done on time. At this point, while as yet we have been 
unable to decide, a friend comes along, and we seek to 
evade the responsibility of making our own decision by 
appealing to him, ‘‘You tell me what to do!’’ How 
few of us have never said in effect if not in words, ‘‘I 
will do this or that if you will’?! How few have never 
taken advantage of a rainy day to stay from church or 
shirk an undesirable engagement! How few have not 
allowed important questions to be decided by some trivial 
or accidental factor not really related to the choice in 
the least! 
This form of decision is accidental decision. It does 
not rest on motives which are vitally related to the case, 
but rather on the accident of external circumstances. 
The person who habitually makes his decisions in this 
way lacks power of will. He does not hold himself to 
the question until he has gathered the evidence before 
him, and then himself direct his attention to the best 
line of action and so secure its performance. He drifts 
with the tide, he goes with the crowd, he shirks respon- 
sibility. 
Accidental Type: Subjective Motives—A second type 
of accidental decision may occur when we are hesitating 
between two lines of action which are seemingly about 
equally desirable, and no preponderating motive enters 
the field; when no external factor appears, and no ad- 
vising friend comes to the rescue. Then, with the neces- 
sity for deciding thrust upon us, we tire of the worry 
and strain of deliberation and say to ourselves, ‘‘ This 
thing must be settled one way or the other pretty soon; 
Iam tired of the whole matter.’’ When we have reached 
this point we are likely to shut our eyes to the evidence 
in the case, and ay largely upon the whim or mood 
of the moment. Very likely we regret our decision the
-P-A-G-E-299
  THE WILL 281 
next instant, but without any more cause for the regret 
than we had for the decision. 
It is evident that such a decision as this does not 
rest on valid motives but rather on the accident of sub- 
jective conditions. Habitual decisions of this type are 
an evidence of a mental laziness or a mental incompe- 
tence which renders the individual incapable of marshal- 
ing the facts bearing on a case. He cannot hold them 
before his mind and weigh them against each other un- 
til one side outweighs the other and dictates the decision. 
Of course the remedy for this weakness of decision lies 
in not allowing oneself to be pushed into a decision sim- 
ply to escape the unpleasantness of a state of indecision, 
or the necessity of searching for further evidence which 
will make the decision easier. 
On the other hand, it is possible to form a habit of 
indecision, of undue hesitancy in coming to conclusions 
when the evidence is all before us. This gives us the 
mental dawdler, the person who will spend several min- 
utes in an agony of indecision over whether to carry an 
umbrella on this particular trip; whether to wear black 
shoes or tan shoes today ; whether to go calling or to stay 
at home and write letters this afternoon. Such a person 
is usually in a stew over some inconsequential matter, 
and consumes so much time and energy in fussing over 
trivial things that he is incapable of handling larger 
ones. If we are certain that we have all the facts in a 
given case before us, and have given each its due weight 
so far as our judgment will enable us to do, then there 
is nothing to be gained by delaying the decision. Nor 
is there any occasion to change the decision after it has 
once been made unless new evidence is discovered bear- 
ing on the ease. 
Decision Under Effort.—The highest type of decision is
-P-A-G-E-300
  282 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
that in which effort is the determining factor. The pres- 
sure of external circumstances and inward impulse . 
not enough to overcome a calm and determined J will. 
Two possible lines of action may lie open before us. 
Every current of our being leads toward the one; in 
addition, inclination, friends, honors, all beckon in the 
same direction. From the other course our very nature 
shrinks; duty alone bids us take this line, and promises 
no rewards except the approval of conscience. Here is 
the crucial point in human experience; the supreme test 
of the individual; the last measure of man’s independ- 
ence and power. Winning at this point man has exer- 
cised his highest prerogative—that of independent 
choice; failing here, he reverts toward the lower forms 
and is a creature of circumstance, no longer the master 
of his own destiny, but blown about by the winds of 
chance. And it behooves us to win in this battle. We 
may lose in a contest or a game and yet not fail, because 
we have done our best; if we fail in the conflict of mo- 
tives we have planted a seed of weakness from which we 
shall at last harvest defeat. 
Jean Valjean, the galley ‘slave of almost a score of 
years, escapes and lives an honest life. He wins the re- 
spect and admiration of friends; he is elected mayor of 
his town, and honors are heaped on him. At the height 
of his prosperity he reads one day that a man has been 
arrested in another town for the escaped convict, Jean 
Valjean, and is about to be sent to the galleys. Now 
comes the supreme test in Jean Valjean’s life. Shall 
he remain the honored, respected citizen and let ‘an in- 
nocent man suffer in his stead, or shall ‘he proclaim him- 
self the long-sought criminal and again have the collar 
riveted on his neck and take his place at the oars? He 
spends one awful night of conflict in which contending
-P-A-G-E-301
  THE WILL 283 
motives make a battle ground of his soul. But in the 
morning he has won. He has saved his manhood. His 
conscience yet lives—and he goes and gives himself up 
to the officers. Nor could he do otherwise and still re- 
main a man. 
3. STRONG AND WEAK WILLS 
Many persons. will admit that their memory or im- 
agination or power of perception is not good, but few 
will confess to a weak will. Strength of will is every- 
where lauded as a mark of worth and character. How 
ean we tell whether our will is strong or weak? 
Not a Will, But Wills.—First of all we need to remem- 
ber that, just as we do not have a memory, but a system 
of memories, so we do not possess a will, but many dif- 
ferent wills. By this I mean that the will must be called 
upon and tested at every point of contact in experience 
before we have fully measured its strength. Our will 
may have served us reasonably well so far, but we may 
not yet have met any great number of hard tests because 
our experience and temptations have been limited. 
Nor must we forget to take into account both the nega- 
tive and the positive functions of the will. Many there 
are who think of the will chiefly in its negative use, as 
a kind of a check or barrier to save us from doing cer- 
tain things. That this is an important function cannot 
be denied. But the positive is the higher function. 
There are many men and women who are able to resist 
evil, but able to do little good. They are good enough, 
but not good for much. They lack the power of effort 
and self-compulsion to hold them up to the high stand- 
ards and stern endeavor necessary to save them from 
inferiority or mediocrity. It is almost certain that for
-P-A-G-E-302
  284 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
most who read these words the greatest test of their 
will power will be in the positive instead of the nega- 
tive direction. 
Objective Tests a False Measure of Will Power.—The 
actual amount of volition exercised in making a decision 
cannot be measured by objective results. The fact that 
you follow the pathway of duty, while I falter and 
finally drift into the byways of pleasure, is not certain 
evidence that you have put forth the greater power of 
will. In the first place, the allurements which led me 
astray may have had no charms for you. Furthermore, 
you may have so formed the habit of pursuing the path- 
way of duty when the two paths opened before you, that 
your well-trained feet unerringly led you into the nar- 
row way without a struggle. Of course you are on safer 
ground than I, and on ground that we should all seek 
to attain. But, nevertheless, I, although I fell when I 
should have stood, may have been fighting a battle and 
manifesting a power of resistance of which you, under 
similar temptation, would have been incapable. The 
only point from which a conflict of motives can be safely 
judged is that of the soul which is engaged in the 
struggle. 
4, VOLITIONAL TYPES 
Several fairly well-marked volitional types may be dis- 
covered. It is, of course, to be understood that these 
types all grade by insensible degrees into each other, 
and that extreme types are the exception rather than the 
rule. 
The Impulsive Type-——The impulsive type of will 
goes along with a nervous organism of the hair- 
trigger kind. The brain is in a state of highly unstable 
equilibrium, and a relatively slight current serves to set
-P-A-G-E-303
  THE WILL 285 
off the motor centers. Action follows before there is time 
for a counteracting current to intervene. Putting it 
in mental terms, we act on an idea which presents itself 
before an opposing one has opportunity to enter the 
mind. Hence the action is largely or wholly ideo-motor 
and but slightly or not at all deliberate. It is this type 
of will which results in the hasty word or deed, or the 
rash act committed on the impulse of the moment and 
repented of at leisure; which compels the frequent, ‘‘I 
didn’t think, or I would not have done it!’’? The impul- 
sive person may undoubtedly have credited up to him 
many kind words and noble deeds. In addition, he 
usually carries with him an air of spontaneity and whole- 
heartedness which goes far to atone for his faults. The 
fact remains, however, that he is too little the master 
of his acts, that he is guided too largely by external cir- 
cumstances or inward caprice. He lacks balance. 
Impulsive action is not to be confused with quick de- 
cision and rapid action. Many of the world’s greatest 
and safest leaders have been noted for quickness of de- 
cision and for rapidity of action in carrying out their 
decisions. It must be remembered; however, that these 
men were making decisions in fields well known to them. 
They were specialists in this line of deliberation. The 
motives for and against certain lines of action had often 
been dwelt upon. All possible contingencies had been 
imaged many times over, and a valuation placed upon the 
different decisions. The various concepts had long been 
associated with certain definite lines of action. Deliber- 
ation under such conditions can be carried on with light- 
ning rapidity, each motive being checked off as worth so 
much the instant it presents itself, and action can fol- 
low immediately when attention settles on the proper 
motive to govern the decision. This is not impulse, but
-P-A-G-E-304
  286 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
abbreviated deliberation. These facts suggest to us that 
we should think much and carefully over matters in 
which we are required to make quick decisions. 
Of course the remedy for the overimpulsive type is 
to cultivate deliberative action. When the impulse comes 
to act without consideration, pause to give the other 
side of the question an opportunity to be heard. Check 
the motor response to ideas that suggest action until 
you have reviewed the field to see whether there are 
contrary reasons to be taken into account. Form the 
habit of waiting for all evidence before. deciding. 
““Think twice’’ before you act. 
The Obstructed Will.—The opposite of the impulsive 
type of will is the obstructed or balky will. In this type 
there is too much inhibition, or else not enough impul- 
sion. Images which should result in action are check- 
mated by opposing images, or do not possess vitality 
enough as motives to overcome the dead weight of in- 
ertia which clogs mental action. The person knows well 
enough what he should do, but he cannot get started. 
He ‘‘cannot get the consent of his will.’’ It may be the 
student whose mind is tormented by thoughts of coming 
failure in recitation or examination, but who yet can- 
not force himself to the exertion necessary safely to 
meet the ordeal. It may be the dissolute man who tor- 
tures himself in his sober moments with remorse and the 
thought that he was intended for better things, but who, 
waking from his meditations, goes on in the same old 
way. It may be the child undergoing punishment, who is 
to be released from bondage as soon as he will promise 
to be good, but who cannot bring himself to say the nec- 
essary words. It not only may be, but is, man or woman 
anywhere who has ideals which are known to be worthy 
and noble, but which fail to take hold. It is anyone who
-P-A-G-E-305
  THE WILL 287 
is following a course of action which he knows is be- 
neath him. 
No one can doubt that the moral tragedies, the failures 
and the shipwrecks in life come far more from the break- 
ing of the bonds which should bind right ideals to ac- 
tion than from a failure to perceive the truth. Men 
differ far more in their deeds than in their standards of 
action. 
The remedy for this diseased type of will is much 
easier to prescribe than to apply. It is simply to re- 
fuse to attend to the contrary thoughts which are block- 
ing action, and to cultivate and encourage those which 
lead to action of the right kind. It is seeking to vital- 
ize our good impulses and render them effective by act- 
ing on them whenever opportunity offers. Nothing can 
be accomplished by moodily dwelling on the disgrace of 
harboring the obstructing ideas. Thus brooding over 
them only encourages them. What we need is to get en- 
tirely away from the line of thought in which we have 
met our obstruction, and approach the matter from a 
different direction. The child who is in a fit of sulks 
does not so much need a lecture on the disagreeable habit 
he is forming as to have his thoughts led into lines not 
connected with the grievance which is causing him the 
trouble. The stubborn child does not need to have his 
will ‘‘broken,’’ but rather to have it strengthened. He 
may be compelled to do what he does not want to do; but 
if this is accomplished through physical force instead of 
by leading to thoughts connected with the performance 
of the act, it may be doubted whether the will has in any 
degree been strengthened. Indeed it may rather be de- 
pended upon that the will has been weakened; for an 
opportunity for self-control, through which alone the 
will develops. has been lost. The ultimate remedy for
-P-A-G-E-306
  288 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
rebellion often lies in greater freedom at the proper time. 
This does not mean that the child should not obey right- 
ful authority promptly and explicitly, but that just as 
little external authority as possible should intervene to 
take from the child the opportunity for self-compulsion. 
The Normal Will—tThe golden mean between these two 
abnormal types of will may be called the normal or bal- 
anced will. Here there is a proper ratio between impul- 
sion and inhibition. Ideas are not acted upon the in- 
stant they enter the mind without giving time for a sur- 
vey of the field of motives, neither is action ‘‘sicklied 
o’er with the pale cast of thought’’ to such an extent 
that it becomes impossible. The evidence is all consid- 
ered and each motive fully weighed. But this once done, 
decision follows. No dilatory and obstructive tactics 
are allowed. The fleeting impulse is not enough to per- 
suade to action, neither is action unduly delayed after 
the decision is made. 
5. TRAINING THE WILL 
The will is to be trained as we train the other powers 
of the mind—through the exercise of its normal func- 
tion. The function of the will is to direct or control in 
the actual affairs of life. Many well-meaning persons 
speak of training the will as if we could separate it from 
the interests and purposes of our daily living, and in 
some way put it through its paces merely for the sake 
of adding to its general strength. This view is all wrong. 
There is, as we have seen, no such thing as general power 
of will. Will. is always required in specific acts and 
emergencies, and it is precisely upon such matters that 
it must be exercised if it is to be cultivated. 
Will to Be Trained in Common Round of Duties ——What 
+
-P-A-G-E-307
  THE WILL 289 
is needed in developing the will is a deep moral interest 
in whatever we set out to do, and a high purpose to do 
it up to the limit of our powers. Without this, any ar- 
tificial exercises, no matter’ how carefully they are de- 
vised or how heroically they are carried out, cannot but 
fail to fit us for the real tests of life; with it, artificial 
exercises are superfluous. It matters not so much what. 
our vocation as how it is performed. The most common- 
place human experience is rich in opportunities for the 
highest form of expression possible to the will—that of 
directing us into right lines of action, and of holding 
us to our best in the accomplishment of some dominant 
purpose. 
There is no one set form of exercise which alone will 
serve to train the will. The student pushing steadily 
toward his goal in spite of poverty and grinding labor; 
the teacher who, though unappreciated and poorly paid, 
yet performs every duty with conscientious thorough- 
ness; the man who stands firm in the face of temptation ; 
the person whom heredity or circumstance has handi- 
capped, but who, nevertheless, courageously fights his 
battle; the countless men and women everywhere whose 
names are not known to fame, but who stand in the hard 
places, bearing the heat and the toil with brave, un- 
flinching hearts—these are the ones who are developing 
a moral fiber and strength of will which will stand in 
the day of stress. Better a thousand times such train- 
ing as this in the thick of life’s real conflicts than any 
volitional calisthenics or priggish self-denials entered 
into solely for the training of the will! 
School Work and Will Training—The work of the 
school offers as good an opportunity for training powers 
of will as of memory or reasoning. On the side of inhi- 
bition there is always the necessity for self-restraint and
-P-A-G-E-308
  290 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
control so that the rights of others may not be infringed 
upon, Temptations to unfairness or insincerity in les- 
sons and examinations are always to be met. The social 
relations of the school necessitate the development of 
personal poise and independence. 
On the positive side the opportunities for the exercise 
of will power are always at hand in the school. Every 
lesson gives the pupil a chance to measure his strength 
and determination against the resistance of the task. 
High standards are to be built up, ideals maintained, 
habits rendered secure. 
The great problem for the teacher in this connection 
is so to organize both control and instruction that the 
largest possible opportunity is given to pupils for the 
exercise of their own powers of will in all school relations. 
6. FREEDOM OF THE WILL, OR THE EXTENT OF ITS 
CONTROL 
‘We have seen in this discussion that will is a mode of 
‘control—control of our thoughts and, through our 
thoughts, of our actions. Will may be looked upon, then, 
as the culmination of the mental life, the highest form 
of directive agent within us. Beginning with the direc- 
ticn of the simplest movements, it goes on until it goy- 
erns the current of our life in the pursuit of some dis- 
tant ideal. 
Limitations of the Will—Just how far the will can go 
in its control, just how far man is a free moral agent, has 
long been one of the mooted questions among the phi- 
losophers. But some few facts are clear. If the will can 
exercise full control over all our acts, it by this very fact 
determines our character; and character spells destiny. 
There is not the least doubt, however, that the will in
-P-A-G-E-309
  THE WILL 291 
thus directing us in the achievement of a destiny works 
under two limitations: First, every individual enters 
upon life with a large stock of inherited tendencies, 
which go far to shape his interests and aspirations. And 
these are important factors in the work of volition. 
Second, we all have our setting in the midst of a great 
material and social environment, which is largely beyond 
our power to modify, and whose influences are constantly 
playing upon us and molding us according to their type. 
These Limitations the Conditions of Freedom.—Yet 
there is nothing in this thought to discourage us. For 
these very limitations have in them our hope of a larger 
freedom. Man’s heredity, coming to him through ages 
of conflict with the forces of nature, with his brother 
man, and with himself, has deeply instilled in him the 
spirit of independence and self-control. It has trained 
him to deliberate, to choose, to achieve. It has developed 
in him the power to will. Likewise man’s environment, 
in which he must live and work, furnishes the problems 
which his life work is to solve, and out of whose solution 
will recewes its only true development. 
It is through the action and interaction of these two 
factors, then, that man is to work out his destiny. 
‘What he ¢s, coupled with what he may do, leads him to 
what he may become. Every man possesses in some de- 
gree a spark of divinity, a sovereign individuality, a 
power of independent initiative. This is all he needs to 
make him free—free to do his best in whatever walk 
of life he finds himself. If he will but do this, the doing 
of it will lead him into a constantly growing freedom, 
and he can voice the ery of every earnest heart: 
Build thee more stately mansions, O my soul! 
As the swift seasons roll!

7. PROBLEMS IN OBSERVATION AND INTROSPECTION 
1. Give illustrations from your own experience of the 
various types of action mentioned in this discussion. From 
your own experience of the last hour, what examples of im- 
pulsive action can you give? Would it have been better in 
some cases had you stopped to deliberate? 
2. Are you easily influenced by prejudice or personal pref- 
erence in making decisions? What recent decisions have been 
thus affected? Can you classify the various ones of your 
decisions which you can recall under. the four types men- 
tioned in the text? Under which class does the largest number 
fall? Have you a tendency to drift with the crowd? Are 
you independent in deciding upon and following out a line 
of action? What is the value of advice? Ought advice to do 
more than to assist in getting all the evidence on a ease be- 
fore the one who is to decide? 
3. Can you judge yourself well enough to tell to which vo- 
litional type you belong? Are you over-impulsive? Are you 
stubborn? What is the difference between stubbornness and 
firmness? Suppose you ask your instructor, or a friend, to 
assist you in classifying yourself as to volitional type. Are 
you troubled with indecision; that is, do you have hard work 
to decide in trivial matters even after you know all the facts 
in the case? What is the cause of these states of indecision? 
The remedy? 
4. Have you a strong power of will? Can you control 
your attention? Do you submit easily to temptation? Can 
you hold yourself up to a high degree of effort? Can you 
persevere? Have you ever failed in the attainment of some
-P-A-G-E-311
  THE WILL 293 
cherished ideal because you could not bring yourself to pay 
the price in the sacrifice or effort necessary? 
5. Consider the class work and examinations of schools 
that you know. Does the system of management and control 
throw responsibility on the pupils in a way to develop their 
powers of will? 
6. What motives or incentives can be used to encourage 
pupils to use self-compulsion to maintain high standards of 
excellence in their studies and conduct? Does it pay to be 
heroic in one’s self-control?

  CHAPTER XVIII 
SELF-EXPRESSION AND DEVELOPMENT 
We have already seen that the mind and the body are 
associated in a copartnership in which each is an indis- 
pensable and active member. We have seen that the 
body gets its dignity and worth from its relation with 
the mind, and that the mind is dependent on the body 
for the crude material of its thought, and also for the 
carrying out of its mandates in securing adaptation to 
our environment. We have seen as a corollary of these 
facts that the efficiency of both mind and body is con- 
ditioned by the manner in which each carries out its 
share of the mutual activities. Let us see something 
more of this inter-relation. 
1. INTER-RELATION OF IMPRESSION AND EXPRESSION 
No impression without corresponding expression has 
become a maxim in both physiology and psychology. In- 
ner life implies self-expression in external activities. 
The stream of impressions pouring in upon us hourly 
from our environment must have means of expression if 
development is to follow. We cannot be passive recipi- 
ents, but must be active participants in the educational 
process. We must not only be able to know and feel, but 
to do.

impressions which come to us and how they all lead on

  296 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
toward ultimate expression is shown in the accompany- 
ing diagram (Fig.20). Our material environment is 
thrusting impressions upon us every moment of our life ; 
also, the material objects with which we deal have be- 
come so saturated with social values that each comes to 
us with a double significance, and what an object means 
often stands for more than what it is. From the lives 
of people with whom we daily mingle; from the wider 
circle whose lives do not immediately touch ours, but who 
are interpreted to us by the press, by history and liter- 
ature; from the social institutions into which have gone 
the lives of millions, and of which our lives form a part, 
there come to us constantly a flood of impressions whose 
influence cannot be measured. So likewise with reli- 
gious impressions. God is all about us and within us. 
He speaks to us from every nook and corner of nature, 
and communes with us through the still small voice from 
within, if we will but listen. The Bible, religious in- 
struction, and the lives of good people are other sources 
of religious impressions constantly tending to mold our 
lives. The beautiful in nature, art, and human conduct 
constantly appeals to us in esthetic impressions. 
All Impressions Lead toward Expression.—Each of 
these groups of impressions may be subdivided and ex. 
tended into an almost indefinite number and variety, 
the different groups meeting and overlapping, it is true, 
yet each preserving reasonably distinct characteristics. 
A common characteristic of them all, as shown in the dia- 
gram, is that they all point toward expression. The va- 
rieties of light, color, form, and distance which we get 
through vision are not merely that we may know these 
phenomena of nature, but that, knowing them, we may 
use the knowledge in making proper responses to our 
environment. Our power to know human sympathy and
-P-A-G-E-315
  SELF-EXPRESSION AND DEVELOPMENT = 297 
love through our social impressions are not merely that 
we may feel these emotions, but that, feeling them, we 
may act in response to them. 
It is impossible to classify logically in any simple 
scheme all the possible forms of expression. The dia- 
gram will serve, however, to call attention to some of the 
chief modes of bodily expression, and also to the results 
of the bodily expressions in the arts and vocations. Here 
again the process of subdivision and extension can be 
carried out indefinitely. The laugh can be made to tell 
many different stories. Crying may express bitter sor- 
row or uncontrollable joy. Vocal speech may be carried 
on in a thousand tongues. Dramatic action may be made 
to portray the whole range of human feelings. Plays 
and games are wide enough in their scope to satisfy the 
demands of all ages and every people. The handicrafts 
cover so wide a range that the material progress of civi- 
lization can be classed under them, and indeed without 
their development the arts and vocations would be im- 
possible. Architecture, sculpture, painting, music, and 
literature have a thousand possibilities both in technique 
and content. Likewise the modes of society, conduct, 
and religion are unlimited in their forms of expression. 
Limitations of Expression.—While it is more blessed to 
give than to receive, it is somewhat harder in the doing; 
for more of the self is, after all, involved in expression 
than in impression. Expression needs to be cultivated as 
an art; for who can express all he thinks, or feels, or 
conceives? Who can do his innermost self justice when 
he attempts to express it in language, in music, or in 
marble? The painter answers when praised for his 
work, ‘‘If you could but see the picture I intended to 
paint!’’ The pupil says, ‘“‘I know, but I cannot tell.’’ 
The friend says, ‘‘I wish I could tell you how sorry I 
 
-P-A-G-E-316
  298 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
am.’’ The actor complains, ‘‘If I could only portray 
* the passion as I feel it, I could bring all the world to my 
feet!’’ The body, being of grosser structure than the 
mind, must always lag somewhat behind in expressing 
the mind’s states; yet, so perfect is the harmony between 
the two, that with a body well trained to respond to 
the mind’s needs, comparatively little of the spiritual 
need be lost in its expression through the material. 
3. THE PLACE OF EXPRESSION IN DEVELOPMENT 
Nor are we to think that cultivation of expression re- 
sults in better power of expression alone, or that lack of 
cultivation results only in decreased power of expres- 
sion. 
Intellectual Value of Expression.—There is a distinct 
mental value in expression. An idea always assumes new 
clearness and wider relations when it is expressed. 
Michael Angelo, making his plans for the great cathe- 
dral, found his first concept of the structure expanding 
and growing more beautiful as he developed his plans. 
The sculptor, beginning to model the statue after the 
image which he has in his mind, finds the image growing 
and becoming more expressive and beautiful as the clay 
is molded and formed. The writer finds the scope and 
worth of his book growing as he proceeds with the writ- 
ing. The student, beginning doubtfully on his construc- 
tion in geometry, finds the truth growing clearer as he 
proceeds. The child with a dim and hazy notion of the 
meaning of the story in history or literature discovers 
that the meaning grows clear as he himself works out 
its expression in speech, in the handicrafts, or in a 
matic representation. 
So we may apply the test to any realm of thought
-P-A-G-E-317
  SELF-EXPRESSION AND DEVELOPMENT 299 
whatever, and the law holds good: It is not in its ap- 
prehension, but in its expression, that a truth finally 
becomes assimilated to our body of usable knowledge. 
And this means that in all training of the body through 
its motor expression we are to remember that the mind 
must be behind the act; that the intellect must guide the 
hand; that the object is not to make skillful fingers 
alone, but to develop clear and intelligent thought as 
well. 
Moral Value of Expression.—Expression also has a dis- 
tinct moral value. There are many more people of good 
intentions than of moral character in the world. The 
rugged proverb tells us that the road to hell is paved 
with good intentions. And how easy it is to form good 
resolutions. Who of us has not, after some moral strug- 
gle, said, ‘‘I will break the bonds of this habit: I 
will enter upon that heroic line of action!’’ and then, 
satisfied for the time with having made the resolution, 
continued in the old path, until we were surprised 
later to find that we had never got beyond the resolu- 
tion. 
It is not in the moment of the resolve but in the mo- 
ment when the resolve is carried out in action that the 
moral value inheres. To take a stand on a question of 
right and wrong means more than to show one’s alle- 
giance to the right—it clears one’s own moral vision and 
gives him command of himself. Expression is, finally, 
the only true test for our morality. Lacking moral ex- 
pression, we may stand in the class of those who are 
merely good, but we can never enter the class of those 
who are good for something. One cannot but wonder 
what would happen if all the people in the world who 
are morally right should give expression to their moral 
sentiments, not in words alone, but in deeds. Surely the 
 
-P-A-G-E-318
  300 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
millennium would speedily come, not only among the 
nations, but in the lives of men. 
Religious Value of Expression.—True religious expe- 
rience demands expression. The older conception of a 
religious life was to escape from the world and live a life 
of communion and contemplation in some secluded spot, 
ignoring the world thirsting without. Later religious 
teaching, however, recognized the fact that religion can- 
not consist in drinking in blessings alone, no matter how 
ecstatic the feeling which may accompany the process; 
that it is not the receiving, but this along with the giving 
that enriches the life. To give the cup of cold water, to 
visit the widow and the fatherless, to comfort and help 
the needy and forlorn—this is not only scriptural but 
it is psychological. Only as religious feeling goes out 
into religious expression, can we have a normal religious 
experience. 
Social Value of Expression—The criterion of an edu- 
cation once was, how much does he know? The world 
did not expect an educated man to do anything; he was 
to be put on a pedestal and admired from a distance. 
But this criterion is now obsolete. Society cares little 
how much we know if it does not enable us to do. People 
no longer admire mere knowledge, but insist that the 
man of education shall put his shoulder to the wheel 
and lend a hand wherever help is needed. Education is 
no longer to set men apart from their fellows, but te 
make them more efficient comrades and helpers in the 
world’s work. Not the man who knows chemistry and 
botany, but he who can use this knowledge to make two 
blades of grass grow where but one grew before, is the 
true benefactor of his race. In short, the world demands 
services returned for opportunities afforded; it expects 
social expression to result from education.
-P-A-G-E-319
  SELF-EXPRESSION AND DEVELOPMENT 301 
And this is also best for the individual, for only 
through social service can we attain to a full realization 
of the social values in our environment. Only thus can 
we enter fully into the social heritage of the ages which 
we receive from books and institutions; only thus can 
we come into the truest and best relations with humanity 
in a common brotherhood; only thus can we live the 
broader and more significant life, and come to realize 
the largest possible social self. 
3. EDUCATIONAL USE OF EXPRESSION 
The educational significance of the truths illustrated 
in the diagram and the discussion has been somewhat 
slow in taking hold in our schools. This has been due 
not alone to the slowness of the educational world to 
grasp a new idea, but also to the practical difficulties 
connected with adapting the school exercises as well to 
the expression side of education as to the impression. 
From the fall of Athens on down to the time of Froebel 
the schools were constituted on the theory that pupils 
were to receive education; that they were to drink in 
knowledge, that their minds were to be stored with facts. 
Children were to ‘‘be seen and not heard.’? Education 
was largely a process of gorging the memory with in- 
formation. 
Easier to Provide for the Impression Side of Education. 
—Now it is evident that it is far easier to provide for 
the passive side of education than for the active side. 
All that is needed in the former case is to have teachers 
and books reasonably full of information, and pupils 
sufficiently docile to receive it. But in the latter case, 
the equipment must be more extensive. If the child is to 
be allowed to carry out his impressions into action, if
-P-A-G-E-320
  302 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
he is actually to do something himself, then he must 
be supplied with adequate equipment. 
So far as the home life was concerned, the child of 
several generations ago was at a decided advantage over 
the child of today on the expression side of his educa- 
tion. The homes of that day were beehives of industry, 
in which a dozen handicrafts were taught and practiced. 
The buildings, the farm implements, and most of the 
furniture of the home were made from the native timber. 
The material for the clothing of the family was pro- 
duced on the farm, made into cloth, and finally into gar- 
ments in the home. Nearly all the supplies for the table 
came likewise from the farm. ‘These industries de- 
manded the combined efforts of the family, and each 
child did his or her part. 
But that day is past. One-half of our people live in 
cities and towns, and even in the village and on the 
farm the handicrafts of the home have been relegated 
to the factory, and everything comes into the home 
ready for use. The telephone, the mail carrier, and the 
deliveryman do all the erands even, and the child in the 
home is deprived of responsibility and of nearly all op- 
portunity for manual expression. This is no one’s fault, 
for it is just one phase of a great industrial readjust- 
ment in society. Yet the fact remains that the home has 
lost an important element in education, which the school 
must supply if we are not to be the losers educationally 
by the change. 
The School to Take Up the Handicrafts.—And modern 
educational method is insisting precisely on this point. 
A few years ago the boy caught whittling in school was 
a fit subject for a flogging; the boy is today given bench 
and tools, and is instructed in their use. Then the child 
was punished for drawing pictures; now we are using
-P-A-G-E-321
  SELF-EXPRESSION AND DEVELOPMENT — 303 
drawing as one of the best modes of expression. Then 
instruction in singing was intrusted to an occasional 
evening class, which only the older children could attend, 
and which was taught by some itinerant singing master ; 
today we make music one of our most valuable school 
exercises. Then all play time was so much time wasted ; 
now we recognize play as a necessary and valuable mode 
of expression and development. Then dramatic repre- 
sentation was confined to the occasional exhibition or 
evening entertainment; now it has become a recognized 
part of our school work. Then it was a crime for pupils 
to communicate with each other in school; now a part 
of the school work is planned so that pupils work in 
groups, and thus receive social training. Then our 
schoolrooms were destitute of every vestige of beauty; 
today many of them are artistic and beautiful. 
This statement of the case is rather over-optimistic it 
applied to our whole school system, however. For there 
are still many schools in which all forms of handicraft 
are unknown, and in which the only training in artistic 
expression is that which comes from ecaricaturing the 
teacher. Singing is still an unknown art to many teach- 
ers. The play instinct is yet looked upon with suspicion 
and distrust in some quarters. A large number of our 
schoolrooms are as barren and ugly today as ever, and 
contain an atmosphere as stifling to all forms of natural 
expression. We can only comfort ourselves with Holmes’s 
maxim, that it matters not so much where we stand as 
in what direction we are moving. And we certainly are 
moving toward a larger development and greater effi- 
ciency in expression on the part of those who pass 
through our schools. 
Expression and Character.—Finally, all that has been 
said in this discussion has direct reference to what we
-P-A-G-E-322
  304 THE MIND AND ITS EDUCATION 
call character—that mysterious something which we so 
often hear eulogized and so seldom analyzed. Character 
has two. distinct phases, which may be called the subjec- 
tive phase and the social phase; or, stating it differently, 
character is both what we are and what we do. The first 
of these has to do with the nature of the real, innermost 
self; and the last, with the modes in which this self 
finds expression. And it is fair to say that those about 
us are concerned with what we are chiefly from its rela- 
tion to what we do. 
Character is not a thing, but a process; it is the suc- 
cession of our thoughts and acts from hour to hour. It 
is not something which we can hoard and protect and 
polish unto a more perfect day, but it is the everyday 
self in the process of living. And the only way in which 
it can be made or marred is through the nature of this 
stream of thoughts and acts which constitute the day’s 
life—is through being or doing well or ill. 
Two Lines of Development.—The cultivation of charac- 
ter must, then, ignore neither of these two lines. To 
neglect the first is to forget that it is out of the abun- 
dance of the heart that the mouth speaks; that a corrupt 
tree cannot bring forth good fruit; that the act is the 
true index of the soul. To omit the second is to leave 
the character half formed, the will weak, and the life 
inefficient and barren of results. The mind must be 
supplied with noble ideas and high ideals, with right 
emotions and worthy ambitions. On the other hand, 
the proper connection must be established between 
these mental states and appropriate acts. And the acts 
must finally grow into habits, so that we naturally and 
inevitably translate our ideas and ideals, our emotions 
and ambitions into deeds. Our character must be strong 
not in thought and feeling alone, but also in the power

to return to the world its finished product in the form 
of service. 
4, PROBLEMS IN INTROSPECTION AND OBSERVATION 
1. Do you find that you understand better some difficult 
point or problem after you have succeeded in stating it? Do 
you remember better what you have expressed? 
2. In whieh particular ones of your studies do you think 
you could have done better if you had been given more op- 
portunity for expression? Explain the psychology of the 
maxim, we learn to do by doing. 
3. Observe various schools at work for the purpose of 
determining whether opportunities for expression in the reci- 
tations are adequate. Have you ever seen a class when list- 
less from listening liven up when they were given something 
to do themselves? 
4. Make a study of the types of laughter you hear. Why 
is some laughter much more pleasant than other laughter? 
What did a noted sculptor mean when he said that a smile 
at the eyes cannot be depended upon as can-one at the mouth?’ 
5. What examples have you observed in children’s plays 
showing their love for dramatic representation? What handi- 
erafts are the most suitable for children of primary grades? 
for the grammar school? for the high school? 
6. Do you number those among your acquaintance who 
seem bright enough, so far as learning is concerned, but who 
cannot get anything accomplished? Is the trouble on the 
expression side of their character? What are you doing about 
your own powers of expression? Are you seeking to culti- 
vate expression in new lines? Is there danger in attempting 
too many lines?

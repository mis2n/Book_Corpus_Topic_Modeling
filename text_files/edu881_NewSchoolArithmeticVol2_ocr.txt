Ni Ze PREFACE 
While the authors have assumed that students entering the sixth grade have 
acquired reasonable facility in ordinary computations, they have included in 
this volume a more extended treatment of each of the four fundamental opera- 
tions with ample provision for application and drill. Since success in all arith- 
metical work is directly dependent upon efficiency in these fundamentals, the 
authors feel that the space and time given to these fundamentals are justified. 
Practically all the other topics included in this volume are those that have 
found secure places in text-books of similar gradein general use. Inaddition, how- 
ever, special attention is given to a few features which seem to demand place 
in a modern text-book on arithmetic. 
First, a somewhat extended study of graphs is deemed necessary because 
of the use being made of them in general publications. Not only technical jour- 
nals but magazines of all classes, as well as newspapers, are employing graphs 
for purposes of comparison in one of the several forms presented in this volume. 
The mathematics of the graphs here treated is sufficiently elementary to be 
mastered easily by the pupils in the upper grammar grades. 
Second, the equation has long been recognized as the most powerful instru- 
ment for problem solving, and yet in the field of elementary arithmetic its 
value has not only been ignored, but unnatural and forced processes have been 
employed in order to avoid the natural method based upon the equation. The 
authors have allowed the formula and equation to perform their logical func- 
tions as they have evolved in the regular work in mensuration and in prob- 
lems requiring the indirect process. 
Third, a few new applications of percentage seem to demand attention in a 
modern text-book on arithmetic. The interest developed in stocks and bonds 
through thrift and war stamps, liberty bonds, etc., vitalizes an old and unin- 
teresting topic almost to the extent of making it new. While most of the 
mathematics of the Federal Farm Loan Associations is embodied in prepared 
tables, the manipulation of these tables and the informational side of the sub- 
ject are important and are given proper space. Phases of farming, commerce, 
vand industry not always included in a text-book are treated not only for the 
arithmetic involved but also for the general informational value to the student. 
Fourth, the authors have attempted a combination of the types of text-books 
represented on the one hand by the extreme spiral organization, and on the other 
by the rigid topical organization. To avoid the too frequent changes of topics 
resulting often in mere confusion, and to eliminate the long grind of holding the

PREFACE 
young mind to a complete mastery of each topic before introducing a psycholog- 
ically correlated topic have been the aims of the authors. To illustrate: the 
topic of percentage is introduced in an elementary form in the latter part of 
the fifth grade in its natural connection with decimal fractions; it is treated in 
more detail again in the sixth grade; and its applications are emphasized in 
the seventh and eighth grades. 
Fifth, since many children leave school by the end of the fifth year, the essen- 
tials of arithmetic have been given early with a view to providing the child 
with such arithmetical skill as will meet the usual demands outside the school- 
room and at the same time to preparing the child who remains in school for 
continuous development of his mathematical powers. 
Sixth, in the lower grades the purpose has been to provide the child with 
the tools of arithmetical processes; that is, to habituate the fundamental oper- 
ations with integers, fractions, and denominate numbers; while in the upper 
grades the purpose has been to develop by means of industrial and economic 
applications the thinking and judging ability of the child. Ample provision 
for the first is found in motivated drills and simple applications; while problems 
with complete data gathered from the child’s personal or reading experience, 
as well as problems with incomplete data to be completed by the child, provide 
natural and interesting means of developing judgment and reason.

1. REVIEW OF FUNDAMENTAL OPERATIONS 
NOTATION AND NUMERATION 
A unit is a single thing of any kind or a group of things con- 
sidered as a whole, by which any other quantity of the same, 
kind is measured; as one dollar, one horse, one apple, one 
pound, one dozen, the number 1. 
A number is a unit or a collection of units; as one man, ten 
dollars, fifty bushels, three dozen, the number 6. 
Notation is a system of writing numbers by the use of figures - 
or letters. 
The Arabic notation expresses numbers by the use of the 
following figures: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0. 
Each of these figures represents a number, except 0 which :    
is used only to help other figures express numbers; thus, 1 
and 0 written together (10) represent the number ten. 
The number represented by a figure standing alone is its 
simple value. Which figure has the largest simple value? _ 
Which the smallest? Which has no value? When more than. 
one figure is used to represent 2 number, the value of each figure, 
in addition to its simple value, is determined by the place if 
occupies. Which figure represents the largest place value and 
which represents the smallest place value in each of the fok-.... 
  lowing numbers: 675, 576, 765, 196, 961, 619, 1867, 81762 o 
  For convenience in reading numbers, the figures are “gen+ ° 
erally separated by the comma into periods of 
each; thus, 4, 165,384. The first period counti 
right is called units’ period, the second thousand: 
third millions’, the fourth billions’, the fifth tril, veer. o...

4, Roman System of Notation and Numeration 
The Roman notation employs the following seven capital 
letters to represent numbers: 
I v x L c D M 
1 5 10 50 100 = 500 1000 
The other numbers are represented by combinations of 
letters in accordance with the following laws: 
I. Repeating a letter repeats its value; thus XX represents 
20, CC represents 200. 
II. Whena letter is followed by one of less value, the values 
of the letters are added; thus VI represents 6, LX represents 60. 
III. When a letter is followed by one of greater value, the 
value of the smaller is subtracted from that of the greater; thus 
IV represents 4, XL represents 40. 
IV. When a letter is placed between two letters of greater 
value, the least is subtracted from the sum of the other two; 
thus XIX represents 19, XXIV represents 24. 
V. Placing a bar over a letter multiplies its value by 1000; 
_ thus, M represents 1,000,000. 
Read the following: 
I XI XXX Cc M

5. U. S. Money 
In writing dollars and cents a decimal point must be placed 
after dollars and before cents. Thus $7.25 is read: seven dol- 
lars and twenty-five cents. If cents are written as a decimal 
part of a dollar, the dollar sign must precede the decimal point. 
Thus 25 cents is written $.25 or $0.25. Cents occupy the first 
two places at the right of the decimal point; 5 cents is written 
$.05 or $0.05. 
Read: $0.07, $0.55, $4.75, $8.19, $7.00. 
Change to dollars and cents: 35¢, 95¢, 875¢, 1005¢. 
Write: five dollars and five cents; eight dollars and ten cents; 
three hundred dollars and three cents.

The process of uniting two or more numbers into one whole 
is called addition. 
The result obtained by adding two or more numbers is called 
the sum or amount. 
The sign of addition is a perpendicular cross (+). It is read 
plus and indicates that the numbers between which it is placed 
are to be added.

add the columns downward, and see if the results agree. Another 
test is to begin at the bottom of the right hand column and 
write the entire sum of each column, placing the right hand 
figure in each sum one place further to the left, and then add 
the sums of the columns; then begin at the top of the left hand

James had 14 marbles, and gave Thomas 6. How many 
had he left? 
Subtraction is the process of finding the difference between 
two numbers. The number from which the subtraction is 
nade is called the minuend. The number subtracted is called 
the subtrahend. 
The result obtained by subtracting the subtrahend from the 
minuend is called the remainder or difference. 
The sign, (—), of subtraction is called minus. It indicates 
that the number before which it is placed is to be subtracted 
from the number preceding it. 
Thus, $9— $5 indicates that $5 is to be subtracted from $9.

11. Written Exercises 
From 815 subtract 326. 
815 This method of subtraction, which is called the Austrian method, 
326 is based on the principle that equal numbers may be added to both 
-—- minuend and subtrahend without changing the result, and that 
489 the sum of the subtrahend and remainder equals the minuend. We 
must find a number which added to the subtrahend will make the 
minuend. As 6 is a larger number than 5, there is no number that could be 
added to 6 to make 5, Hence, we add 10 to 5 which makes 15. Since 9 added 
to 6 makes 15, write 9 as the units’ figure of the remainder. As 1 ten was added 
to the minuend, we must add 1 ten to the figure 2 in subtrahend which makes 
3 tens, As no number can be added to 3 to make 1, we must add 10 tens to 
1 ten, which makes 11 tens. The number to be added to 3 tens to make 11 
tens is 8 tens, therefore write 8 tens in the remainder. As 10 tens, which equal 
1 hundred, were added to the minuend, 1 hundred must be added to the 3 hun- 
dreds inthe subtrahend, which makes 4 hundreds. As 4 added to 4 makes 8, 
write 4 for the hundreds’ figure in the subtrahend. 
815 In solving examples in subtraction you may do it rapidly, thus: 
326 9+6 equals 15, write 9; 8+-3 equals 11, write 8; 4+-4 equals 8, write 
4s9.* 
To check, add the subtrahend and remainder. Ifthe sum is the »ninuend, 
the work is assumed to be correct.

7 units cannot be subtracted from 6 units; hence, we take 1 ten from the 3 
tens and add it to 6 units, which makes 16 units. 7 from 16 leaves 9. As 4 
tens cannot be subtracted from 2 tens, we take 1 hundred, which is equal to 
10 tens, and add it to 2 tens, making 12 tens. 4 tens from 12 tens leave 8 tens. 
2 hundred from 7 hundred leave 5 hundred.

16. . MULTIPLICATION 
Multiplication is a short method of adding equal numbers. 
$5-+$5+$5+$5+ $5+-$5 = $30 
The process may also be written, 6X $5 = $30. 
The oblique cross (X) is the sign of multiplication and is 
read times or multiplied by. 
The number to be multiplied is called the multiplicand. 
The number showing how many times the. multiplicand is 
taken is called the multiplier. 
The result obtained by multiplication is called the product. 
4X7 bu. =28 bu. 
Which is the multiplicand? The multiplier? The product? 
What is the name of the product? The name of the mul- 
tiplicand? 
A concrete number is one that refers to some particular kind 
of unit or thing, as $5, 10 ft., 7 horses. 
An abstract number is one that does not refer to some par- 
ticular kind of unit or thing, as 5, 7, 9. 
The multiplicand may be either a concrete or an abstract 
number. The product is always of the same denomination as 
the multiplicand. The multiplier is always used as an abstract 
number. 
In such statements as the following: Lf a carpenter earns $6 
a day, how much will 10 carpenters earn? it appears that the 
multiplier, 10 carpenters, is a concrete number, but when we 
analyze the problem we see that in multiplying we use it 
abstractly. Thus we would say, If 1 carpenter earns $6 aday, 
ro carpenters will earn 10X86 or $60. We would not say, 
IO carpenters times $6. 
Numbers that are to be multiplied together are called factors. 
Does the order in which thé factors occur affect the product?

DIVISION 25 
23. DIVISION 
Division is the process of finding how many times one num- 
ber is contained in another. 
The number to be divided is called the dividend. 
The number by which we divide is called the divisor. 
The result obtained by dividing is called the quotient. 
The sign, (+), of division is read divided by. When 
placed between two numbers, it indicates that the one on the left 
is divided by the one on the right. Thus, 6+3 is read, 6 
divided by 3. 
The remainder is the part of the dividend left when the 
division is not exact; thus, 2—1 remainder

1. A father had $20 which he wished to divide equally 
among his 4 sons. How much would each receive? 
_$5 We could also say if the 4 sons receive $20, one 
4)$20 son would receive 4 of $200r$5. Note that in 
the above the quotient is the same name as 
the dividend and is only 1 of 4 equal parts of the dividend. 
This kind of division is called division by partition. 
2. How many times is 4 ft. contained in 12 ft.? 
3 
4 ft.)12 ft. 
Note in the above problem that the divisor and the dividend 
are concrete numbers and the quotient is an abstract number. 
This kind of division is called division by measurement. 
Division may be thought of as a short method of subtraction. 
Thus: 12 ft.—4 ft.=8 ft.; 8 ft.—4 ft.=4 ft.; and 4 ft. 
—4 ft.=0.

add the remainder, if any, to the product. If the result gives 
the dividend, the work is assumed to be correct.

246)1004879 = divisorare 1004, which is called a partial dividend. 
984 How many times is 246 contained in 1004? 
2087 . When we think of 246 as being nearly 250 and 
1968 1004 as just a little more than 1000, and by com- 
——- paring we know 1000 is 4 X 250, we conclude that 
1199 4 is the first quotient figure; write it over the 4 
984 in the dividend. Multiply the divisor by quo- 
ST tient figure 4 and subtract the product from the 
partial dividend. Bring down 8 from the dividend 
. and write it with the remainder to form the next 
partial dividend. 208, the partial dividend, is smaller than the divisor 246, and 
therefore will not contain it and we write 0 in the quotient. Bring down 7 
from the dividend and write it with the remainder for the next partial dividend. 
' The partial dividend 2087 contains the divisor 246, 8 times. Multiply and 
subtract. Continue the process till every figure in the dividend is used. Judg- 
ment is required in ascertaining the correct quotient figure. 
If in the trial division the product of the divisor by the quotient is larget 
than the partial dividend, the quotient figure is too large. If after subtract- 
ing the product of the divisor by the quotient figure from the partial dividend 
the remainder is found to be equal to or larger than the divisor, the quotient 
figure is too small.

29. Symbols of Operations 
You have learned the meaning of the signs +, —, X, +, 
when used with numbers in single relations: Thus,4+4 in- 
dicates addition, 8—4 indicates subtraction, 5X4 indicates 
multiplication, 8+4 indicates division. 
4+8+2=What? If we add (4+8) and divide the sum by 
2, the resultis6. If we add 4 to the quotient of 8+ 2, the result 
is 8. The latter result is correct because the operations in- 
dicated by X or + take precedence over the operations indi- 
cated by + or —. 
Operations indicated by X and + are performed in the order 
of their occurrence unless otherwise indicated by parenthesis, 
as, 16+8X4—12+6X3=42. The signs + and — set off the 
terms of an expression. Thus, in the expression above the 
terms are 16, 8X4, 12+6x3. 
4+5X2=14. Why not 18? 
16—12+4=13 8+4+2=10. 
8-~-2X3=2. 8X4+2=16.

FACTORING 85 
The parenthesis ( ) is used to show that the numbers within — 
it are to be used as one simple quantity; thus (8+-4) + 2, means 
that the sum of 8and4, or 12,is to be divided by2. Hence, - 
(8+4) +2=6.

SPBAR Into how many equal parts is circle A divided? Circle 
Be? Circle C? Circle D? Circle E? 
One of the equal parts into which an integral unit is divided 
is a fractional unit. Name the fractional units in circle A; 
B;C;D; E. . 
A fraction is one or more fractional units, as 4, $, 4, $, ¢- 
Fractions may be expressed in the form of division in which 
the numerator takes the place of the dividend and the de- 
nominator takes the place of the divisor. Thus, 3+2 may be 
written 3. : 
The denominator names the size of the fractional unit as 
compared with the integral unit. The word denominate means 
to name. / 
The numerator tells the number of fractional units taken; 
thus, the fraction t tells that a unit has been divided into 8 
equal parts and that 7 of the fractional units are taken.

6 ft. +3=? 6 sevenths+3=? 
Just as 6 ft.+3=2 ft., so 6 sevenths+3=2 sevenths. That 
is, $+3=. 
Consider: $+5. 
Since we cannot divide the number of sevenths by 5 ex- 
actly, we must reduce $ to higher terms so that the numerator 
will contain 5 an exact number of times. 
$25=3 B25; or we may obtain the same result by 
multiplying $ * by the reciprocal of 5; thus, #X4=9's- 
The reciprocal of a number is 1 divided by that number.

64. Mixed Exercises 
1. We have already learned that mathematical signs are 
used to indicate operations and to express relationships. The 
signs X and ~+ are regarded as expressing a closer relationship 
than the signs+ and —. Thus, we associate together and treat 
as one quantity or term expressions or numbers connected by 
the signs X and +. The signs of +and — stand between the 
terms. These operations are to be performed after the opera- 
tions indicated by X and +. In case of doubt as to correct 
association of numbers use the signs of aggregation, called 
( ) parenthesis, [ } bracket, or ——- vinculum. These are used 
to inclose quantities that are to be treated as one, or for the 
purpose of changing the order of operations from that indi- 
cated by the signs of +, —, X, and +. 
Example: 8+4+6X3. The correct order is to add the 
product of 6X3 to the quotient of 8+4. The result is 20. 
-The vinculums or brackets, while not necessary, make the 
order unmistakable, as 8+4+6X3 =20.

70. RATIO 
The ratio of one number to another is the quotient obtained 
by dividing the first number by the second. Thus, the ratio 
of 4 to 9 is obtained by dividing 4 by 9, or $. The ratio of 10 
to 5is 4,2 = 2, 
Ratio is written by placing the sign (:) between the first 
term and the second term. Thus, the ratio of 8 to 4 is written 
8: 4and is read, the ratio of 8 to 4. 
The first term of a ratio is called the antecedent. 
The second term of a ratio is called the consequent.

ESTIMATING 93 
74. ESTIMATING 
1. What is the sum of 645 and 367? 
Nore: You can tell at a glance that the sum of the hundreds is 9 hundred, 
and you will observe that 45 is a little less than 50 and 67 is a little more than 
50; hence, the sum of these numbers is approximately 100. Your estimate 
would probably be about 1000. By addition, you can test your estimate and 
ascertain just how much you have overestimated or underestimated the 
number. Bear in mind there is a wide difference between estimating and guess- 
ing. You might guess at what was under a box, turned upside down, and miss 
your guess entirely; but if you look at the size of the box and estimate how much 
it will hold, your estimate will be in units representing the capacity of the box, 
although your estimate may be far too large or too small. 
Estimate first and then test your estimate by performing 
the operation: 
1. 668+330 4. 287+397 7. 2500-1350 
2. 2904595 5. 294-131 8. 67599 
3. 666+430 6. 837-225 9. 800+70 
10. Estimate the perimeter of your school room. Measure 
and test your estimate. 
11. Estimate the length of your blackboard. Measure and 
test your estimate. 
12. Estimate the circumference of the nearest tree to your

16. How far can you throw a base ball? Measure and test 
your estimate. 
17. Estimate the number of pages you can read in a story 
book in one hour. Time yourself and test your estimate. 
Nore: The teacher will find it a profitable exercise to give occasional tests 
in estimating. It stimulates observation and calls into exercise one’s judg- 
ment.

DECIMALS 97 
77. DECIMALS 
You are familiar with the form of a common fraction, such 
as74y,10y-t000- There isa more convenient way of writing 
a fraction whose denominator is 10 or some power of 10. Only 
the numerator is written and the denominator is indicated by 
a period, called a decimal point, placed so there are as many 
figures to the right as there are naughts in the denominator. 
For example, 72y=.3, roy =-75, go's = -125. 
Fractions whose denominators are indicated by the posi- 
tion of a decimal point are called decimal fractions, or decimals. 
A decimal fraction, then, is a fraction whose numerator only 
is written and whose denominator is ten or some power of ten, 
such as 100, 1,000, 10,000, etc.,andis indicated by the position of 
a decimal point , 
78, Reading Decimals 
The numerator of a decimal fraction is read as a whole num- 
ber. The denominator is read by calling a one place decimal 
tenths, as .5, five tenths; a two place decimal hundredths, as 
.05, five hundredths; a three place decimal thousandths, as 
-005, five thousandths; and so on. 
In the table below, the paces to the right of the decimal 
point are the decimal places. The places to the left are the 
places in any integer. 
in decimals as in whole numbers, the place value increases 
from right to left ten fold for each place, as in 22.22. It can 
readily be seen that 2 tenths are 10 times 2 hundredths, and 2 
units are 10 times 2 tenths, and 2 tens are 10 times 2 units. 
Hence, decimals and whole numbers increase and decrease by 
the same scale. The word decimal is derived from a Latin 
word which means ten.

Read the number, 2306, as a whole number, two thousand 
three hundred six. This is the numerator. Note the position 
of the last figure to the right of the decimal point. It is in 
ten-thousandths’ place. This determines the denominator; the 
decimal is then read, two thousand three hundred sin ten- - 
thousandths. ‘The right hand place of the decimal always 
names the denominator. 
Tf there is a whole number and a decimal, the point separates 
the whole number from the decimal. The point is read and; 
as 75.45, seventy-five and forty-five hundredths. Numbers 
composed of a whole number and a decimal are mixed deci- 
mals. 
Read the following: 
1. 15 25 1.25 325.1325 8.25

Whole numbers may be written in decimal form without 
changing their value. 
Thus, 2 may be written 2.0 or 2.00 or 2.000, etc., and may be 
read either 2 or 20 tenths or 200 hundredths or 2000 thousandths.

79. Writing Decimals 
To write a decimal fraction, write the numerator and in- 
dicate the denominator by pointing off as many decimal 
places as there are naughts in the denominator of the corre- 
sponding common fraction. If the numerator does not have 
as many figures as there are naughts in the denominator, fill 
in the necessary number of naughts between the point and the 
figures of the numerator, as z3y=.03.

These are called complex decimals. 
A common fraction is an indicated division; hence, a common 
fraction may be changed to a decimal by dividing the numer- 
ator by the denominator:

In this solution, the numerator is written in the form of a 
decimal; thus,3.00, which is read 300 hundredths. 300 hundredths 
+4=75 hundredths =.75. 
To reduce a common fraction to a decimal: Annex naughts 
to the numerator, divide by the denominator and point off 
in the quotient as many decimal places as there are naughts 
annexed to the numerator. If the division can be made exact, 
the quotient is a pure decimal; if the division cannot be made 
exact, the quotient becomes a repeating decimal if the division 
is carried far enough, and may be expressed as a complex decimal.

81. Reducing Decimals to Common Fractions 
The fraction py = oy =a", etc.; observe also that .5= 
-50 = .500, etc. It does not change the value of a fraction to 
multiply or divide both terms by the same number. Annex- 
ing naughts to the right of a decimal does not change its value, 
as, 
py Xt$ = ths; also .5=.50 
To reduce a decimal to a common fraction, express the deci- 
mal in the form of a common fraction and reduce to its lowest 
terms. If it isa mixed number, change the decimal to a com- 
mon fraction and add it to the whole number; thus 3.5=34.

Note that there are as many decimal places in the product as there are 
decimal places in the multiplicand and the multiplier. 
From No. 2 we learn that moving the decimal point one place to the right is 
the same as multiplying by 10. To move it two places to the right is the same 
as multiplying by 100, three places to the right by 1000, and so on. Hence, to 
multiply when the multiplier is a power of ten, move the decimal point as many 
places to the right as there are naughts in the multiplier. 
Direction for multiplying decimals: 
Multiply as in multiplying whole numbers and point off 
as many decimal places in the product as there are decimal places 
in the multiplicand and multiplier.

1. Divide 5.2525 by 1.25. 
Think of the operation in the form of a fraction. Since it does not alter the 
value of a fraction to multiply both terms by the same number, we multiply the 
divisor and dividend each by 100. The divisor thus becomes 125 and the 
dividend 525.25. Thus: 
5.2525 X 100 = 525.25 
125 X100= 125 
Then, 4.202 You will note that after the last division there 
125)525.25 0 was a remainder of 25. A naught was added to the 
500 dividend and the division was made complete. After 
Ba adding the naught, the dividend becomes thou- 
250 sandths; therefore, the quotient becomes thou- 
So sandths,

there are decimal places in the divisor.

Nore: If accuracy to a stated number of decimal places is desired in any of 
the operations in decimals, it is necessary to carry the fraction to one more 
place than the number stated and add 1 to the iast figure in the number re- 
quired if the next figure is 5 or more; otherwise drop'the next figure. 
Thus, in Ex. 2 above, if accuracy to two decimals were required, the answer 
would be .08. For .25+6, the answer correct to three decimal places would 
be .042, for .0416

of the hundred to Thomas. Thomas has then ~§+ of James’s 
peaches. James gave Lucy 7 peaches out of the hundred. 
Lucy has z}y of the 100 peaches. James gave Ellen 20 peaches 
out of the 100, Ellen has zy of the peaches. 
Write the number of hundredths Ellen has. 
James gave William 35 peaches out of the 100. William 
has you of the peaches. What part of 100 peaches is 17 
peaches? 50 peaches? 75 peaches? 29 peaches? 18 peaches? 
In all of the fractions above, what is the denominator? 
In naming fractions whose denominator is 100, we may use 
the word per cent to take the place of the denominator. The 
word per cent means by the hundred. 
To illustrate: Instead of saying James gave Thomas 6 
peaches out of his 100 peaches or James gave Thomas y¢y of 
his 100 peaches, we may say James gave Thomas 6 per cent of 
his 100 peaches. 
17 per cent=_y =.17. 
50 per cent= yoo = -50. 
75 per cent=a'o'5 = .75. 
40 per cent= = 40. 
This sign (%) is used instead of the words per cent, 
60% = =o: -60. 
41% = agg = AT. 
29% = =100=- 29. 
18% =o =.18.

100% = 429 = 1,00.

We have given in these problems a whole or mixed number 
for the multiplicand, the per cent expressed decimally in hun- 
dredths for the multiplier, to find the product. 
There are three numbers involved in every multiplication: 
the multiplicand, the multiplier,and the product. Likewise 
in percentage there are three numbers involved having differ- 
ent names but performing the same office as the corresponding 
numbers in multiplication. 
In percentage, the multiplicand is called the base. The 
multiplier is called the per cent or rate. The product is called 
the percentage. The problems above are problems in per- 
centage.

When money is borrowed, it is customary for the person who 
borrows to give to the one who lends a written statement ac- 
knowledging the debt and promising to repay the money at 
some certain time. 
This statement is called a promissory note and is usually 
written in the following form: 
Nashville, Tennessee, Jan. 1, 1923. 
One year after date, I promise to pay Henry Lane, or order,One Hundred 
Dollars ($100) for value received, with interest at 6%. 
James Brown. 
The person signing the note is called the maker. 
The person to whom the money is to be paid is called the 
payee. 
The sum of money loaned is called the face of the note. 
Who is the maker of the above note? The payee? What is 
the face of the note? What words in the note acknowledge 
the obligation to pay?

the length of your desk with your pencil and find that the desk 
is four, five, or six times the length of the pencil. While the 
relative lengths would be clear to you, no one else would un- 
derstand the comparison unless he knew the length of your 
particular pencil, as pencils are of different lengths. 
But if you should take a ruler and measure your desk and 
find it to be 30 inches in length, every one would understand 
the length of your desk, for the inch is a recognized unit of 
measure established by law for ascertaining lengths. 
A unit measure established by law or custom is called a 
standard measure. 
A concrete number expressed in units of standard measure is 
called a denominate number, as $5, 6 yd., 10 Ib., 3 bu. 
Each class of measurements has a legal standard unit from 
which other larger or smaller units may be derived. Thus, the 
yard is the legal standard unit for measuring lengths. But 
the smaller units, the foot and the inch, and the larger units, 
the rod and the mile, are derived from the yard. Often it is 
convenient to use more than one unit or denomination in 
measuring quantities. Thus, the length of the flag pole may 
be 18 ft. and 6 in. 
A compound denominate number is composed of two or more 
denominations used to express one quantity. 
Sometimes the smaller unit is expressed asa fractional part 
of the next larger unit, as 34 bu. instead of using the com- 
pound denominate number 3 bu. 2 pk.

SURFACE MEASURES 131 
99. SURFACE MEASURE 
A square is a figure having four equal sides and four right 
angles. 
The standard unit of square measure is the square yard, 
the other denominations being derived from it. 
In practice, the size of the unit of measure used depends on 
the size of the surface measured. 
We would measure the area of a leaf in your tablet in sq. in.; 
the area of your blackboard in sq. ft.; the area of the walls of 
your school room in sq. yd.; the area of your state in sq. mi. 
Each of these units is a square derived from its corresponding 
unit of length. The acre is a unit of area not corresponding to 
any measure of length. 
144 sq. in. =1 sq. ft. 
9sq. ft. =1 sq. yd. 
304 sq. yd. =1 sq. rd. 
160 sq. rd. =1 A. 
640 A. =1 sq. mi. 
1 A.=160 sq. rd. =4840 sq. yd. =43560 sq. ft. 
                    
You may take any unit of a compound denominate number 
and express its equivalent in terms of a higher or a lower unit. 
Thus, 800 sq. rd. may be expressed in acres by dividing 800 
sq. rd. by 160, the number of sq. rd. in one acre; or 800 sq. rd. 
may be expressed in sq. yd. by multiplying 800 sq. rd. by 304 
sq. yd., the number of sq. yd. in one sq. rd.

101. SURFACE MEASUREMENTS 
A surface has length and breadth; as your blackboard, school- 
room floor, tablet leaf, etc. Such surface is bounded by lines. 
When lines meet they form angles. Lines that lie in the same 
direction are parallel. Parallel lines can never meet. 
Lines and Angles 
A —8 c 
s—-s A“ c D \ ACUTE OBTUSE 
Lines that lie in the same direction, as AB and CD, are par-_— 
allel. Lines that are not parallel will meet if sufficiently pro- 
duced. The difference in direction of lines-that meet at a 
point is called an angle. 
The size of an angle depends upon the difference in direction 
of the two lines that meet. When a straight line as AB is 
met by another straight line as CD, so as to make the two 
adjoining angles equal, each angle is a right angle. The lines 
AB and CD are then perpendicular to each other. What 
kind of an angle do lines make in forming a square corner? 
An angle less than a right angle is called an acute angle. 
An angle larger than a right angle is called an obtuse angle. 
The name of a figure describing a surface is determined by 
its number of sides and the size of its angles.

Take the 1 sq. in- and see how many times it can be placed on the surface . 
of the rectangle 5 inches long. We find the unit of measure can be placed on 
the length 5 times and on the breadth 3 times, thus making 3 rows of square 
inches with 5 square inchesin a row. Hence, thearea=3X65 sq. in.=15 sq. in. -

  Trapezoid 
107. Trapezoids 
A quadrilateral with only two of its sides parallel is called a 
trapezoid. The parallel sides are called the bases of the trape- 
zoid. 
The perpendicular distance between the bases is called the 
altitude, as LM. 
The line joining the opposite vertices is called the diagonal, 
as AC. 
The diagonal divides the trapezcid into two triangles. The 
base of one triangle is 12 ft., the altitude 5 ft. The base of the 
other triangle is 8 ft., the altitude 5 ft. 
The sum of the areas of the two triangles is the area of the 
trapezoid. 
Area triangle ACD =4 (12X51 sq. ft.) =30 sq. ft. 
Area triangle ABC=4 (8X5X1 sq. ft.) =20 sq. ft. 
Area trapezoid =___.---.---- -------- 50 sq. ft. 
As all the factors are the same except 8 and 12, the upper and lower bases 
of the trapezoid, we may find the area thus:$ (8+12)X5X1sq. ft.=50 sq. ft. 
The area of a trapezoid may be found by multiplying one half the sum of 
"the parallel sides by the altitude and that product by the unit of measure. 
Formula: A=1x(B+b) aX, where B stands for Jowerbase and b for 
upper base.

108. . THE CIRCLE 
A circle is a plane figure bounded by a 
curved line, every point of which is equally 
distant from a point within called the 
center. 
The curved line bounding a circle is called the circumference. 
The distance from the center to the circumference is called the 
radius, 
A line passing through the center of a circle and terminating 
in the circumference is called the diameter, The diameter is 
twice the length of the radius, 
May a circle have more than one radius? More than one 
diameter? Illustrate your answer. 
Measure the circumference of a silver dollar; the diameter. 
Divide the length of the circumference by the length of the 
diameter. 
Measure the circumference of a can lid, water pail, the top 
of a glass tumbler; then measure the diameter of each. 
Divide the length of each circumference by the length of its 
diameter. You have found the circumference to be about 
3+ times the length of the diameter. 
To be more exact, the circumference is 3.1416 times the 
length of the diameter. The Greek letter + may be used to 
represent 3.1416; diameter is represented by d; radius by r; 
and circumference by c. 
If the diameter is given, how is the radius found? (d=2r.) 
If the circumference is given, how is the diameter found?

110. Measurement of Circles 
. The area of a circle is determined by the number of times it 
contains its unit of measure. . 
  Imagine the circle cut into small sectors which we may call triangles, as illus- 
trated in the figure. The altitude of each triangle is the radius of the circle, 
and its base is a part of the circumference. The area of each triangle is half 
the product of its base by its altitude by the unit of measure. The sum of 
the areas of the triangles is the area of the circle. 
Ay =$XbyXrXu 
Ag =}Xbe XrXu 
Ag=$Xbg XrXu, ete. 
A of circle=4(b, +bg+bg-+etc.)XrXu; but by +b, -+bgtetc.=c. 
Hence, we find the area of a circle equals one-half the product of the cir- 
cumference by the radius by the unit of measure, 
I. Formula: A=$}XcXrXu. 
The circumference of a circle is 2X7 Xr, that isc=2X7Xr. 
Hence A=} X2X7XrXr=7Xr%, that is A=TXr. 
Nore: rXr=r1’, just as 3X3=3?.

111. CARPETING 
Carpeting is made in strips most frequently either } of a 
yard or 1 yd. in width. The dealer will not split the width of 
astrip. Hence, ifa fraction of the width of a strip is required, 
the whole strip must be bought. The carpet usually runs the 
length of the room. 
1. How many yards of carpeting 3 yd. wide are required 
for a room 18 ft. long, 15 ft. wide, if the carpet runs lengthwise? 
Divide the width of the room by the 
width of one strip of carpet to find the 
number of strips. 
15 ft.=5 yd., width of room. 
5 yd.+} yd.=6%, or 7; number of 
strips. 
The room is 18 ft. long. The length of 
each strip must be 18ft.=6 yd. Multiply 
the length of each strip by the number of 
strips. 7X6 yd. =42 yd. 
Ifthe strips run crosswise, divide the 
length of the room by the width of a 
strip. 18 ft.=6 yd., length of room, 
6 yd. +4 yd. =8, number of strips. 15 ft. 
=5 yd., the length of 1 strip. Multiply 
the length of one strip by the number of 
strips. 
8X5 yd. =40 yd.

When we speak of the capacity of a box, wagon bed, cistern, 
silo or any container, we mean the quantity it will hold of some 
unit of measure based upon volume. 
Dry Measure 
Dry measure is used: for measuring grain, fruit, vegetables, 
etc. The standard unit of dry measure is the bushel, whose 
volume is 2150.42 cu. in.

60 min. =1 hour (hr.) 
24 br. =1 day (da.) 
7 da. =1 week (wk.) 
365 da. = 1 common year (yr.) 
366 da. =1 leap year 
100 yr. =1 century 
    
    
The standard unit of time is the day. The day is divided 
into 24 equal parts, each of which is called an hour. The day 
extends from midnight to midnight. For convenience in 
counting time, the day is divided into two equal divisions. The 
first division of 12 hr. extends from midnight to 12 o’clock 
(noon). It is 12 o’clock (noon) when the sun is directly over 
the meridian of a place. Time from midnight to 12 o’clock 
(noon) is designated as A.m., (ante meridian), meaning before 
noon. Time from noon to midnight is called P.m., (post me- 
ridian), which means after noon. 
The solar year contains 365 da. 5 hr. 48 min. 46 sec. There 
are 365 days in a common year, and 366 days in a leap year. 
The difference in length between the common year and the 
solar year is 5 hr. 48 min. 46 sec. This difference makes almost 
a day’s time in 4 years. Every year represented by a number 
that is divisible by 4 is a leap year, as 1896, 1916, 1920, except 
the year with which a century ends, in which case it must be 
divisible by 400, as 1600, 2000. 
Name the leap years in the following: 1828; 1918; 1904; 
1899; 1900; 2200; 2400; 
The year is divided into 12 months.

The unit of measure for lumber is the board foot, which is . 
the amount of lumber contained in a board 1 foot square and 
1 inch or less thick. How many times is a board foot con- 
tained in a board 1 ft. wide, 24 ft. long and 1 in. thick? 
A 
In board measure, anything less than one inch in thickness 
is counted as a full inch. 
  Thickness of more than 1 inch is counted at actual thickness.

and 1 in. thick? 
Solution: 6 in.=4 ft. 20X4X1X1 board foot=10 board feet. 
From the above, it will be seen that the number of board feet 
in a piece of lumber is found by multiplying the length ex- 
pressed in feet by the width in feet and this product by the 
thickness expressed in inches.

Any part of the circumference of a 
circle is called an arc. What part of the 
circumference of the large circle is the 
_ arc CEP If there are 360° in the circum- 
ference of the circle, how many degrees 
are there in the arc CE? The small 
circle within the larger has the same cen- 
ter as the larger circle. What part of the 
circumference of the small circle is the arc BD? The angle 
COE is measured by the arc CE, The arc CE=90°. Hence, 
the angle COE=90°. In the same way, it may be shown 
that theangle BOD=90°. Every circle, whether large or small, 
contains 860°. The size of the angle is determined by the 
difference in direction of two Jines meeting at a point, and not 
by the length of the lines forming the sides of the angle. 
An angle of 90° is a right angle.

135... AVERAGES 
If a person were to inquire about the amount of goods a mer- 
chant sold, he would not consider a statement of sales on one 
particular day to be an accurate statement of. the - business 
carried on, as it might be far above or below the usual daily’ 
transactions, and therefore misleading. But if the total amount 
of sales were given for a definite period, say 5 mo. or 5 yr., and 
that total amount of sales divided by the number of months 
or years the merchant had been in business, the result would 
be more reliable, as the days of large sales and small sales would 
be averaged. 
The average of a series of quantities is their sum divided by 
the number of the quantities.

TELEGRAPHIC MESSAGES 193 
138, TELEGRAPHIC MESSAGES 
If one wishes to communicate to a person at a distance in 
the quickest time possible, he will use either the telephone or 
the telegraph. 
The cost of sending messages varies with the distance they 
are sent. 
Charges are usually based on a flat rate of so much for a 
message of not more ihan ten words and an additional charge 
of so much for each additional word. Charges to foreign coun- 
tries are usually fixed at so much per word. 
The words in the body of the telegram only are counted in 
. determining the number of words; no charges are made for the 
name and address of the parties.

POSTAL SERVICE 195 
139. POSTAL SERVICE 
The handling of mail in the United States is an enterprise 
that probably affects more people than any other public ser- 
vice carried on by the government. To defray the cost for 
the transmission of mail, every one who utilizes the service pays 
for same by purchasing postage or by paying the government 
a fixed rate of so much per pound when mailing matter has been 
received at the post office. 
Matter accepted in the mail is classified into the first, second, 
third, or fourth class, 
The first class includes all matter wholly or partly in writing, 
suchaslettersand post cards. The cost of mailing a post cardis 
I¢and letter postage is charged at 2¢ an ounce or fractional part 
of an ounce. 
Second class matter includes newspapers and periodicals and 
when mailed by others than the publisher or a news agent the 
rate is 1 cent for 4 ounces. 
Third class matter embraces circulars, newspapers and period- 
icals not admitted to the second class, nor embraced in the . 
term book. The rate of postage on unsealed third class mat- 
ter is 1 cent for each two ounces or fraction thereof, and the 
limit of the weight is 4 pounds. 
Fourth class matter embraces that known as domestic parcel 
post mail and includes merchandise, farm and factory products, 
etc. 
Limits upon packages to be sent parcel post are as follows: 
(1) For local delivery or for delivery within the first three 
Zones (see Table of Rates below), the package must not exceed 
70 Ib. in weight. 
(2) For all other zones the weight limit is 50 Ib. 
(8) No package is accepted which has a greater total length 
and girth than 84 inches. 
Rates of postage on parcel post packages are as follows: 
(a) Parcels weighing 4 ounces or less, except books, seeds,

plants, etc., 1 cent for each ounce or fraction thereof, any dis- 
tance. © 
(b) Parcels weighing 8 ounces or less containing books, seeds, 
cuttings, etc., 1 cent for each 2 ounces or fraction thereof, re- 
gardless of distance. 
(c) Parcels weighing more than 8 ounces, containing books,

140. STEPS IN PROBLEM SOLVING 
While much of your work in arithmetic consists of making 
computations in addition, subtraction, multiplication, and 
division with whole numbers, common and decimal fractions, 
and denominate numbers, a very important part of your work 
in arithmetic, both in school and out, will consist of problem 
solving. The intelligent solution of a problem involves four 
steps: 
J. A very careful reading of the problem. 
II. The selecting of the proper principles to use, and de- 
ciding how and in what order to use them. 
III. The actual computation. 
IV. Checking and interpreting results. 
Illustration: 
John earned $12.60 by working a week of 6 days. At that 
rate, how much will he earn if he works 10 da.? 
“I. Read carefully, and answer: 
(1) How many days did John work? 
(2) How much did he receive for the work? 
(3) What does the phrase, at that rate, mean? 
(4) What are you required to find in order to complete 
the solution? 
II. Think of the principles necessary to use: 
(1) How many steps are there to be taken? 
(2) What is the first step? 
(8) What principle, or operation, is required for the first 
step? 
(4) What is the second step? 
(5) What principle, or operation, is required for the second 
step? 
III. Make your computation: 
(Q) Can you divide $12.60 by 6 without your pencil? 
(2) Can you multiply $2.10 by 10 without your pencil? 
Nore: Always do as much of the computation as possible, without the use
-P-A-G-E-205
PROBLEM SOLVING 199 
of your pencil. You will find after a little practice that you will make fewer 
errors if you make the computation without your pencil. 
IV. Checking: 
(1) About how many times as much should John get for 
10 days’ work as for 6 days’ work. Should he get three times 
as much? Twice as much? Make your estimate carefully. 
(2) If the result of your computation is about what your 
estimate led you to expect, then check by going over your 
work again hurriedly, or if you are not absolutely certain, 
check by inverse operations, that is, multiplication by division 
and division by multiplication. 
(3) When you interpret the results, note that you first divide 
$12.60 into 6 equal parts, giving $2.10; and that in multiply- 
ing, you are taking $2.10 ten times, thus giving the result in 
dollars, It is important that you consider the divisor in the 
first step and the multiplier in the second step as abstract 
numbers, and that you interpret the results as dollars. 
To acquire skill in solving problems, you should be able 
to take these four steps rapidly and perform the computation 
accurately. In the illustration given above, the complete 
process would be about as follows: 
I, Read: John earnéd $12.60 by working a week of 6 days. 
At that rate, how much will he earn if he works 10 days? 
II. Selecting principles: Two steps: (1) division, (2) mul- 
tiplication, 
III. Computation: (1) $12.60+6= $2.10. 
(2) $2.10X 10= $21. 
ses 10 _ gor, 
IV. Check: 10 days is almost twice as many as 6 days, 
hence he would earn at the same rate almost twice $12.60; or, 
checking by inverse operations, (1) $21+10=$2.10, (2) $2.10 
X6=$12.60. Interpret each result as labeled in IIT. ry

145. PERCENTAGE 
We have already learned that a common fraction whose 
denominator is 10 or some power of 10, such as 100, 1000, 
10000, etc., is also a decimal fraction and may always be written 
in the form of a common fraction or in the form of a decimal, 
as +h, 0.06 TOS) V0. 
Write each of the following fractions in the form of a decimal: 
ti Feo vey, 425. How many places are required for 
hundredths? 
A common fraction with 100 as denominator, or a two-place 
decimal, is frequently expressed in a third form, called the 
per cent form. That is, another name for hundredths is per 
cent. So that instead of -§, or 0.06, we may write 6 per cent. 
Per cent comes from a Latin phrase and means by the hundred 
or hundredths. 
Instead of the words per cent, the symbol % is usually writ- 
ten. This symbol is thought by some to be made up of the 
one and two naughts required to write 100. The naughts are 
placed on each side of the 1, and one of them is tied to the top 
. of the 1. When used with a number, it means that the number 
is the numerator of the fraction whose denominator is 100. 
Note the following equivalent forms: 
ror =0.08=8%. 
$= 20% =.20= 20%. 
125% =125=1 cos 
2 2%o= 003, 
(2 = 07h = .075= 740%, 
Note that there are the same number of per cent (%) as 
there are of hundredths. If, then, common fractions or deci- 
mals are first expressed as so many hundredths, there will be 
just as many per cent as there are hundredths.

: 1X20 : Iustration: {= 5520 =Pfy 
Reduce these fractions to hundredths (common fractions): 
14, 2 4, 8 € 4 5, 5 oth. 
By what do you multiply the numerator and denominator of 
the fraction + in order to reduce it to hundredths? Does 
it change the value of a fraction if you multiply the numerator 
and the denominator by the same number? 
In multiplying } by 38, you are really multiplying the frac- 
tion by what? Does it change the value of a number if it be 
multiplied or divided by one? By what did you divide the 
numerator and denominator each in changing fp to hun- 
dredths? What form of one did you use in reducing each of 
the other fractions to hundredths? 
Multiplying or dividing both terms of a fraction by the same 
number is called reduction, and does not change the value of the 
fraction. 
II, When the denominator is not a divisor or multiple of 
100.

James raised 80 bushels of corn. He paid 10% of the crop 
to his father for the use of the land. How many bushels did 
his father get? 
Solution: 10% of 80 bu.=4'5 of 80 bu.=8 bu. 
Note in this problem that there are three terms or numbers. 
80 bu. represents the whole crop; 10%, the fractional part paid 
for the use of the land; and 8 bushels, the number of bushels 
paid for the use of the land. Which two terms are of like kind? 
In percentage the number, or term, of which you take some 
per cent or fractional part is called the base. The term ex- 
pressing the per cent to be taken is called the rate. : 
The term you get by taking the given number of per cent of

proved road in hauling his corn crop? What per cent saving 
is this on the cost of hauling over bad roads? 
18. If the farmer owns 160 acres of land valued at $80.00 
an acre before the road was improved, and if it is valued at 
$110.00 per acre after the road is improved, how much has his 
farm increased in value? What per cent is this of the original 
value?

1, Mr. Harper borrows 100 bu. of wheat from his neighbor 
in October. He sows the wheat and from the crop which 
he harvests he returns in October next, 100 bu. of wheat and 
6 bu. in addition. These additional 6 bu. we call rent—grain 
rent. Had Mr. Harper given his neighbor $6.00 instead of 6 
bushels of wheat, in addition to 100 bu. of wheat, what kind of 
rent would we call the $6.00? . What would Mr. Harper have 
had during the year in exchange for the $6.00? 
2. Mr. Lewis borrows $100.00 from his neighbor in Oc- 
tober, 1919. A year later he pays his neighbor $100.00 and 
$6.00 in addition. The transaction is similar to those above, 
but the kind of property involved is different. What does 
Mr. Lewis get in exchange for the $6.00? 
Money paid for the use of money is called interest. 
The sum of money for which the interest is paid is called the 
principal. , 
The per cent which the interest for one year is of the principal 
is called the rate of interest. 
The time involved in a money transaction will determine 
jointly with the rate the amount of the interest. 
The sum of the principal and interest is called the amount. 
3. Refer to Ex.2above. Point out the principal, the rate, 
the interest, the time, the amount.

162. The Six Per Cent Method 
This method counts 12 months of 30 days each a year. 
Interest on $1 at 6% for 1 yr. = 80.06 ($1 x .06 = $0.06). 
Interest on $1 at 6% for 1 mo.=$0.005 (4g of $0.06), or 
5 mills. 
Interest on $1 at 6% for 1 da.=$0.0004 (s4y of $0.005), or 
+ mill. 
1. Find the interest on $600.00 at 6% for 8 mo. 18 da. 
Solution: Interest on $1 for 8 mo.=8X$0.005=$0.04 
Interest on $1 for 18 da.=18X$0.000§ = $0.003 
Interest on $1 for 8 mo. 18 da.=$0.043 
Then, Interest on $600 for 8 mo. 18 da. =600$0.043 =$25.80. 
The interest on $1 at 6% for any number of years will be 
$0.06 multiplied by the number of years. 
The interest on $1 at 6% for any number of months will be 
$0.005 multiplied by the number of months; that is, 5 mills 
multiplied by the number of months. 
The interest on $1 at 6% for any number of days will be 
$0.000% multiplied by the number of days; that is, + mill 
multiplied by the number of days. 
The interest on any principal at 6% for any number of months 
and days will be the interest on $1 for the given time multi-

164, Exact Interest 
The United States Government and some banking houses 
count 365 days to the year, and in computing interest they 
count the exact number of days between two dates. Interest. 
so computed is called exact interest. 
1. Find the interest on $120.00 from Jan. 15, 1919, to 
June 1, 1919, at 6%.

16 days in Jan. 
28 days in Feb. 
31 days in Mar. Interest =$120X7$5 X38¢ 
30 days in Apr. =$2.70. 
31 days in May 
_liday in June 
137 days 
Below is a table which shows the exact number of days be- 
tween any day of any month and the same day of any other 
month within a year. In the event of a leap-year if Feb. 29 
falls between the two dates,add 1 day to the number found 
from the table. This table is used by government and bank 
employees for easy and quick reference. 
To find the number of days between the same date of any two months, find 
the number at the crossing of the row and column corresponding to the two 
months. If the two dates are not the same, make the correction by adding or 
subtracting as the case may require. 
Illustration: From May 13 to Aug. 13, there are 92 da. From Sept. 10 
to June 20, there are 273 da.+10 da., or 283 da. From Feb. 23 to Apr. 15,

' Finding the Principal 
What principal at 6% will yield $12.00 interest in 2.yr.? 
Solution: We know that PXRXT=I. Now, since we know that the 
product of three factors, (PRT), is I, and since we have in our problem two 
of them given, (R and T), we may find the third, (P), by dividing I by the 
product, RXT. That is, P=I-+ (RXT). 
Hence, P=$12+(y§-y X2) =$12x3,90 = =$100.

Finding the Time 
How long will it take $500 to yield $22.50 interest at 6%? 
Solution: Since we again have two, (P and R), of the three factors, (P, 
R, and T) and the product of the three, (1), in the formula, 
PXRXT=I,
-P-A-G-E-248
242 — NEW SCHOOL ARITHMETIC 
therefore, we will divide the product of the three factors, (I), by the product of 
the known factors, (PR), to find the third factor, (T). 
That is, T=I+ (PXR) 
Hence, T=$22.50+($500X7§9) =.75 yr.=2 yr.=9 mo.

  167. Finding the Rate. 
1. At what rate will $300 yield $27 interest in 3 yr.? 
Solution: Since we have two, (P and 7), of the three, (P, R, and T), fac- 
tors, and the product of the three, (I), in the formula, PXRXT=I, we will 
divide I by the product of PXT to find R. 
That is, R=I+(PXT). 
Hence, R=$27+-($300X3) =$27+-$900=.03=3%,.

PROMISSORY NOTES 243 
168. - Promissory Notes 
One who borrows money gives a written agreement, or prom- 
ise, to repay the money at a given time. This written agree- 
ment is‘called a promissory note. Unless the interest is paid 
in advance, the note shows the rate of interest. 
Sometimes payment for goods purchased, or services ren. 
dered, is made with a promissery note. Thus, a farmer may 
give his note, promising to pay money later, in exchange for 
his seeds and fertilizers; or a man, unable to pay his doctor 
bill promptly, may make a note promising to pay his physician 
at some later date. 
The following is a common form of a promissory note: | 
  
$312.50 Jackson, Miss., May 1, 1920. 
Three months after date, I promise to pay to the i 
order of 
J. B. Brown 
   
  Three Hundred Twelve and 50/100 Dollars,   
for value received, with interest at 6%. 
S. H. Hamirton. 
  
Note that there are two parties concerned in the note. Mr. 
Hamilton is called the maker, and Mr. Brown is called the 
Payee. The sum borrowed is called the face of the note. 
. When will the above note fall due? 
. Find the interest due at maturity. 
Find the amount due at maturity. 
Who pays this amount? Who receives it? Pode

5. Who holds ‘the note before it matures? 
6. What will become of the note after it is paid? 
If the payee wishes to sell the note before it has matured, he 
writes his name on the back of the note. This is called in- 
dorsing the note, and means that the person indorsing guaran- 
tees the payment of the note when due. 
Write notes having the following data, using your own post- 
office and the date of writing as the heading:

INFORMATION—POSTAL SAVING 245 
169. INFORMATION ABOUT THE UNITED STATES POSTAL 
SAVINGS SYSTEM 
(Extracts from Form PS4. U. S. Postoffice Department.) 
Purpose 
The United States Government accepts interest-bearing postal savings de- 
posits from the public and guarantees to repay them on demand. 
Who May Deposit 
Any person 10 years old or over may open a postal savings account in his 
or her own name by depositing one or more dollars in any post office authorized 
to accept postal savings deposits. 
Amount That May Be Deposited 
A person may deposit any number of dollars, and at any time, until the bal- 
ance to his credit amounts to $2,600, exclusive of accumulated interest. 
Opening Accounts 
A person desiring to open a postal savings account should apply at the post 
office, where full instructions will be given. If for any good reason an intending 
depositor can not apply at the post office, a representative may be sent who 
will be instructed how to proceed. A person residing at a post office not au- 
thorized to accept postal savings deposits may open an account at a depository 
office by mail, through his local postmaster, who will give full instructions on 
application, 
Deposits : 
After a postal savings account has been opened, deposits may be made either 
in person, by a representative, by money order, or by registered mail if the 
money-order service is not available. 
Postal savings deposits are acknowledged by postal savings certificates which 
are made out in the name of the depositor and serve as receipts. These cer- 
tificates are not negotiable or transferable. If certificates are lost, stolen, or 
destroyed, new certificates may be issued. 
Withdrawals 
A depositor may at any time withdraw all or any part of his postal savings 
deposits, upon demand, from the post office where the deposits were made. 
Withdrawals may be made in person, through a representative, or by mail. 
‘Interest 
Postal savings certificates bear simple interest at the rate of 2 per cent a 
year: Interest begins on the first day of the month following the month in
-P-A-G-E-252
246 NEW SCHOOL ARITHMETIC 
which the certificate is issued and becomes due and payable at the expiration 
of each full year from the day interest begins as long as the principal remains 
on deposit. If the deposit is withdrawn, interest will be paid to the end of the 
quarter year last preceding. 
Postal Savings Cards and Stamps 
Amounts less than $1 may be saved by purchasing postal savings cards and 
postal savings stamps at 10 cents each. A savings card with nine savings 
stamps affixed will be accepted as a deposit of $1 either in opening a postal 
savings account or in adding to an existing account, or it may be redeemed in 
cash, 
Postal Savings Bonds 
A depositor may exchange the whole or a part of his deposits for registered 
or coupon United States postal savings bonds, bearing 24 per cent interest, 
issued in denominations of $20, $100, and $500. 
1. If Harry deposits $10 on Dec. 28, 1923, when will interest 
begin? How much will the interest on Harry’s deposit amount 
to Jan.1,1925? (See paragraph on Interest on preceding page.) 
2. John deposits $5 Jan. 3, 1920, and $15 July 20, 1920. 
He withdraws all his deposits Dec. 20, 1920. How much does 
he get? (See Withdrawals and Interest.) 
3. If John should leave his deposits in until Aug: 1, 1921, 
how much would he get? 
4. Mary saves 10¢ a week. How long will it take her to 
get a savings card worth $1? How may she make use of her 
savings card? (See Postal Savings Cards and Stamps.) 
6. Edwin deposits $20 a quarter. How long will it take him 
to save enough to buy a U. S. postal savings bond of $100? 
How much interest will the deposit earn by the time he has 
saved enough to buy the bond? 
6. How much will a $100 bond earn in interest per year? 
(See Postal Savings Bonds.) 
7. How much more does the bond earn per year than the 
$100 kept in the Postal Savings Bank?

171. REVIEW 
In order to use such expressions as 6%, 122%, 163%, etc., 
in the operations of multiplication and division, they should be 
written either as common fractions or decimals. For example, 
, : 163 50 to find 163% of $720, 163% should be writtenas—2, =“— #% a% sho 100’ 300 =4=.163. Explain the reduction. 
Sometimes it is more convenient to use one of the forms and 
sometimes another. In the illustration above, the third form, 
(%), is the most convenient. Why? What is ¢ of $720? If 
we were finding 163% of $900, which of the four forms would 
be the most convenient? Why? Which is the most con- 
venient form for finding 163% of 279? 
What per cent of 40 is 8? 
To answer this question, we think first, What part of 40 is 8? We think 
successively: a5, 4, 2s, 20%. In this process we employ reduction in chang- 
ing zy to ¢ and ¢ to 7%. Then, since hundredths means per cent, we have 
20%. 
What per cent of 45 is 7? 
Again, we think, 7 is what part of 45, which we find is z4;; but since reduction 
of this fraction to a common fraction with 100 as a denominator is not con- 
venient, we change the fraction to decimal form, carrying it to hundredths, thus: 
0135 45)7.00 Hence, we have 158%.

2. Who pays your teacher’s salary? 
3. Who pays for the roads, bridges, the court house, etc., 
in your county? 
4. Where does the state get the money to build asylums 
for the insane, schools for the blind, reformatories for the way- 
ward, etc.? 
The town, city, county, and state governments incur very 
large expenses for such purposes as those mentioned, as well as 
for many others. 
Most of these expenses are provided for by the public, and 
the money which the people pay into the treasuries of the 
town, city, county, and state governments is called taxes. 
The amount of each person’s tax is fixed by the proper 
officials, and the payment is enforced by law. 
For purposes of taxation, property is divided into two classes: 
I. Real Property; such as land, buildings, railroads, and any 
property regarded as immovable. 
IJ. Personal property; such as money, notes, jewelry, and 
household effects. 
In addition to property tax, most states impose a tax upon all 
voters within certain age limits. This is known as poll tax. 
The amount of poll tax varies in different states and in dif- 
ferent counties of the same state, ranging from 50¢ to $3. 
The rate of taxation is stated as so many cents on the hun- 
dred dollars, as so many mills on the dollar, or as so many 
per cent of the assessed value of the property. 
The assessed valuation of property is made by legally au- 
thorized officials and becomes the basis for taxing purposes.

Certain officials of a town, county, or other government are 
legally authorized to fix tax rates for various purposes. They 
first make up a budget of the expenses that are likely to be met. 
Next, they get an assessed valuation of all the property that is 
subject to taxation. Then they assess each owner at a certain 
rate for each item of expense in the budget.

175. Revenues 
The taxes paid by the people upon real estate and personal 
property, including poll taxes, go to the support of the state 
and smaller units of local government. None of these taxes go 
to the support of the national government. 
Our national government is supported chiefly from three 
sources: 
I. Tariffs, duties, or customs, levied as tax upon certain 
imported articles, 
II. Internal revenue taxes, levied upon tobacco products, 
certain kinds of drugs, soft drinks, certain documents, etc. 
III. Income tax, levied upon profits and incomes which 
exceed certain fixed amounts. 
Under I., some imported articles are taxed ad valorem, 
according to value; some are subject to specific duty, or so 
much per article, per pound, etc., and some are subject to both 
ad valorem and specific duties. 
The table below shows the rates of duty, or tariff, on twenty-

176. The Income Tax 
An income tax is a tax levied by the United States Govern- 
ment upon the incomes of individuals and corporations when 
such incomes reach certain specified amounts, The money 
derived from the taxing of incomes is used to help defray the 
expenses of the National Government. 
Nore: Since the details and the rates of the Income Tax Law are frequently 
changed by Congress, only the simplest provisions of the law are here outlined. 
Income tax calculations, involving the surtax and certain other technicalities, 
are purposely omitted from the problems given below. It is deemed sufficient 
for the pupil to learn in a general way why and how such revenue is obtained. 
Two provisions of a recent Revenue Act are: 
I, On incomes of $5000. or less, a normal tax of 4% on the 
remainder after allowing an exemption of $1000. for single per-

177. MEAT PRODUCTS 
Farm animals when sold for meat are sold either alive at 
a given price per pound live weight, or slaughtered at a 
given price per. pound dressed weight. The value of an animal 
per pound live weight depends upon the number of pounds 
it will make dressed weight as well as upon the quality of the 
meat. Ifa farmer is growing beef cattle, he will want to grow 
the type that has the highest percentage of valuable high- 
priced cuts, with the smallest percentage of low priced cuts, 
offaland waste. The dressed weight of the best grade of beef 
cattle ranges from 58% to 69% of live weight, while the dressed 
weight of the low-grade or coarse beef cattle varies from 40% 
to 50% of live weight, and the meat is of poorer quality. 
1. If two beeves weighing 1400 pounds each were sold on 
the market and the dressed weight of one was 65% of the live 
weight and the other 40% of the live weight, how much more 
was one worth than the other if beef sold at an average price 
_ of 20¢ a pound? 
2. A coarse beef weighed on foot 900 pounds. A high- 
grade beef weighed on foot 1200 pounds. If the dressed weight 
of the coarse beef was 42% of its live weight, and the dressed 
weight of the high-grade beef was 58% of its live weight, which 
beef would be the more profitable for a butcher to buy, the 
coarse beef at 6¢ a pound live weight or the high-grade beef at 
8¢ a pound live weight, provided the butcher sells the beef of 
each animal at the same price? 
Hint: Find the cost per pound dressed weight of each. 
3. What is the value of a coarse beef whose live weight is 
950 pounds, if its dressed weight is 50% of its live weight, and 
the beef sells at an average of 20¢ a pound? 
4. Is it better to sell by dressed weight at 20¢ a pound 
or by live weight at 10¢ a pound, a high-grade beef weighing 
1200 pounds whose dressed weight is 58% of the live weight?

PARTIAL PAYMENTS 263 
PART III. 
179. "PARTIAL PAYMENTS 
Sometimes a man who has bought property and who has 
given his note in payment for it reserves the option of making 
part payments on the debt from time to time. 
These are called partial payments. The amount and date of 
each payment are written on the back of the note. 
The United States Rule of partial payments is the legal rule 
in nearly all states. It is really a decree of the Supreme Court 
of the United States. The rule follows: 
I. Find the amount of the principal to the time of the first 
payment, subtract the payment, consider the remainder as 
a new principal, find the amount to the time of the second pay- 
ment, subtract the payment, and thus continue until the final 
settlement is made. 
Il. If any payment does not equal or exceed the interest, 
then find the interest up to the time when two or more payments 
equal or exceed the interest. 
1. A note for $1800 given April 1, 1918, showed the fol- 
lowing payments: April 1, 1919, $708; June 1, 1920, $672. 
Find the amount due on the note April 1, 1921, interest at 6%. 
Solution: 
1919 4 L Interest on $1800 at 6% for 1 yr. = $108

2. Mr. Crouch gave his note for $600 to Wm. Carter, re- 
serving permission to make payments at any time. The note 
was dated Jan. 15, 1923, and was to run for 1 year and draw 
8% interest. On the back of the note were the following 
indorsements: 
March 15, 1923, received $6. Wm. Carter. 
July 1, 1923, received $50. Wm. Carter. 
Dec. 1, 1923, received $50. Wm. Carter. 
Note: Since the payment on March 15 was not suflicient to pay the inter. 
est then due, the principal from Jan. 15 to March 15 will not be reduced. It 
will save time to find the amount of $600 from Jan. 15 to July 1, and subtract 
the sum of the two payments from this amount to find the new principal.

MERCHANT'S RULE 265 
180. The Merchant’s Rule 
The United States Rule for computing the amount due on a 
note where partial payments are made provides that unless the 
payment at any particular time equals or exceeds the interest 
up to that time the principal remains the same until such time 
as the sum of the payments equals or exceeds the interest. The 
effect of this rule frequently inclines the maker of the note to 
postpone making any payments until the date of settlement. 
Arule that seems fairer where partial payments are made on 
a note is called the Merchant’s Rule. It follows: 
(1) Find the amount of the face of the note from the date 
of the note to the date of settlement. 
(2) Find the amount of each payment from the date of the 
payment to the date of settlement. 
(3) Deduct the sum of the amounts of the payments from 
the amount of the face of the note. 
(4) The remainder is the amount due.

INSURANCE 267 
181. INSURANCE 
In some communities, property owners organize for the 
purpose of sharing losses and damages that are likely to happen 
to property by reason of fires, storms, etc. Each member of 
the organization pays into its treasury, at regular intervals or 
when called upon, a certain amount of money to compensate 
persons sustaining loss by fire, or otherwise. The person suffer- 
ing the loss is paid for his loss an amount fixed by the proper 
officials of the organization. With such an organization, no 
one owner suffers any very great loss, and all have the protec- 
tion afforded by cooperation, 
Out of this principle, applied to both property and life, has 
grown one of the greatest business institutions of the world— 
the insurance business. The insurance company secures the 
membership of a large number of people, usually from a wide 
area, and charges each member a comparatively small sum 
for the protection given. 
Policy—The written agreement signed by the proper officials 
of the company and by the person seeking the protection is 
called a policy, or an insurance policy. 
Face of Policy—The amount specified in the agreement to 
be paid in case of loss or damage is called the face of the policy. 
Property is not usually insured at its full value. 
Premium—The cost of the insurance, or the fee paid at fixed 
. intervals, is called the premium. 
The rate of premium, or insurance rate, may be stated as so 
much on $100, or $1,000, or a certain per cent of the face of 
the policy; and the premiums may be paid at any one of several 
specified intervals, as annually, once every three years, etc.

183. Life Insurance 
Most people who are properly concerned about their financial 
condition in old age and the welfare of those dependent upon 
them carry insurance upon their lives as a matter of protec- 
tion against possible want. This protection is afforded the 
insured and dependents before the death of the insured, or 
the dependents after the death of the insured, according to 
the terms of the policy. 
The following are the principal kinds of life insurance policies: 
I. The ordinary life insurance policy guarantees the 
payment of a fixed amount of money at the death of the insured, 
the premiums to be paid for life. 
Il The twenty-payment life policy makes the face of the 
policy payable at death, the annual premiums to be paid for 
twenty years unless insured dies within that time.
-P-A-G-E-276
270 NEW SCHOOL ARITHMETIC 
Ill. The endowment policy provides for the face of the 
policy to be paid to the insured if living at the end of the en- 
dowment period, or to his estate if death occurs before that time, 
premiums to be paid until the end of the endowment period, 
or until death if the insured dies before the end of the endow- 
ment period. 
IV. The term policy requires payment of premiums for 
a specified period of time, and for the payment of the face of 
the policy only in the event of the death of the insured within 
the term of insurance. The cost of term insurance is much 
less than any of the other kinds for the reason that the com- 
pany may not have to pay anything on the policy. 
There are other kinds of insurance policies which differ only 
slightly from one or another of the four forms described. 
The cost of life insurance is expressed as so much per year 
on each $1,000 of insurance. The cost depends upon the age 
of the insured and upon the kind of policy desired. The term 
policy is least expensive of the four kinds described above. The 
ordinary life policy is less expensive than the twenty-payment 
or the endowment policies. Why? 
The cost per $1,000 varies with the different insurance com- 
panies, but the table below is a fair average.

BUSINESS OF FARMING 273 
187. THE BUSINESS OF FARMING 
Within recent years scientific farming has been responsible 
for improved methods along many lines. Some of these im- 
provements dre: better treatment of the soil, economy of labor 
by the use of improved machinery, road building, cooperative 
organizations and industries for farmers, better buying and 
marketing conditions, and lower rates of interest on loans neces- 
sary to carry on farming operations on the proper scale. 
Farming has always been the most important industry in 
the South, and while scientific methods have been somewhat 
delayed there are indications that the South is soon to become 
the most important agricultural section of the country. Almost 
three-fourths of the land in the South is still unimproved. As 
more of these unimproved lands are placed under cultivation 
and methods of farming are improved we may expect the 
South to become more nearly self-supporting in agricultural 
productions. The Secretary of Agriculture reported recently 
that the average farm in one of the Southern states produced 
less than 2 eggs a week, about $ pint of milk per day, $ of a 
hog per year, y'g of a beef per year, and z4q of a sheep per 
year. So low is the production along these and other lines that 
the annual cotton crop is not sufficient to pay for the food that 
is shipped into the South from other sections. There are 
large importations of wheat, corn, and oats into a number of 
the Southern states. Three of these states annually import 
almost $100,000,000 worth of these grains. 
On the next page are the acreages and values of farms, the 
crop acreages, and the average crop values per year during a 
period of six years in twelve Southern states. 
1. Rank these 12 states with respect to each of the four 
columns, numbering the state having the highest rank, 1; the 
one next highest, 2; etc., to the one having lowest rank, 12.

PRESERVING SOIL FERTILITY 275 
188. (Preserving Soil Fertility) 
Note to teacher: This section may be omitted without interrupting the 
sequence. (Data from Mayne and Hatch’s Agriculture.) 
Soil that has been often cropped usually needs certain plant 
elements in some form to replace the elements which have been 
exhausted by the crops from year to year. The most important 
of these elements are nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash. 
Average barn-yard manure or fertilizer contains these elements 
in considerable proportions. It has been found that every 
1,000 lb. of live weight farm animals and fowls will produce 
fertilizer as follows: 
| No. of tons 
Animal in 1 year Value 
12 $40 
14 39 
9 45 
14 40 
18 80 
4 68 
  This table means that if two calves together weigh 1,000 lb. 
they will produce fertilizer at the rate of 14 tons a year, and the 
14 tons are worth $40. 
It has been computed that 2 T. of barnyard fertilizer a year 
are sufficient for 1 acre of ordinary crops. 
1. For how many acres will two horses weighing 1,200 Ib. 
each furnish fertilizer? 
2. Ifa farmer keeps a herd of 8 cows averaging 950 lb. 
- each,what is the value of the fertilizer for 1 yr.P How much 
land will it fertilize? 
3. If the farmer also has 30 sheep averaging 60 Ib. each, 
find the value of the fertilizer and the number of acres it will 
keep productive each year. 
4, If the farmer has 100 hens averaging 4% lb. each, find 
the value of the fertilizer.
-P-A-G-E-282

5. Find the value of the fertilizer produced by 12 pigs 
with an average weight of 150 Ib. How many acres of land 
will it fertilize? 
' 6. Mr. Smith lives in a town where he has a garden 100 
ft. by 108.9 ft. How many chickens averaging 3% Ib. each will 
Mr. Smith need to keep to supply his garden with the proper 
amount of fertilizer? What is the value of the fertilizer? 
7. Make up a problem similar to the above based on all | 
the farm animals on your own premises or on those of some 
one you know. Solve the problem. 
189. Crops and Soil Fertility 
Note to teacher: This section may be omitted without interrupting the 
sequence. 
The farmer may buy fertilizers that are manufactured with 
any required proportion of the three principal plant foods— 
nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash. / 
Since nitrogen can be supplied by planting the land in legumes 
such as clover, or cowpeas, or soy beans, or alfalfa, and turning 
them under, the plant foods which the farmer usually wishes 
to buy in commercial fertilizers are phosphoric acid and potash, 
The table below shows the number of pounds of each of the 
three principal plant foods in a ton of twenty-four farm prod-

It is customary with fertilizer dealers and farmers to refer 
to commercial fertilizers as, “2—8—2”, “%—1li—1,” etc.; 
meaning, “2% nitrogen, 8% phosphoric acid, 2% potash,” 
“3% nitrogen, 11% phosphoric acid, 1% potash,” etc. Some- 
times the order of the formula is changed to “2—2—8,” etc., 
meaning, “2% nitrogen, 2% potash, 8% phosphoric acid,” etc. 
Pupils should make inquiries as to local custom. Unless other- 
wise indicated, the order in this text will be nitrogen, phosphoric 
acid, potash, this being the order used by experiment stations. 
If the fertilizer has only phosphoric acid in it, as is true in 
much that is used in certain sections, it is usually called, “14% 
_ acid,” or “16% acid,”. etc., depending upon the per cent of 
phosphoric acid contained. 
1. If the values of the three chief food plants for fertilizing 
purposes are 25¢ per lb. for the nitrogen, 8¢ per Ib. for the 
phosphoric acid, and 30¢ per Ib. for the potash, find the value 
of 1 ton of a brand of fertilizer with the formula 1—12—2. 
Note: The values of nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash fluctuate from 
time to time, depending upon the supply and demand.

192. : Borrowing Money 
Men frequently borrow money to carry on their business 
through a dull or non-productive season. For example, a 
shoe dealer usually finds the summer a dull season for his busi- 
ness, but the fall and winter seasons require a full stock of 
goods which must be bought dvring the summer or preceding 
winter. He may prefer to borrow money and pay cash for his 
stock, for the reason that cash discounts on the goods amount 
to more than interest on the borrowed money. Or, a farmer 
may need to borrow money in the spring in order to buy seed, 
fertilizers, etc., for the coming crops. In the case of the shoe 
19
-P-A-G-E-288
282 NEW SCHOOL ARITHMETIC 
dealer, the borrowed money is paid back with interest after he 
has sold part or all of his winter shoes, and in the case of the 
farmer the money is paid back with interest after he has har- 
vested and sold his crops. 
1. Mr. Taylor borrows $1,200 at the bank on July 1 at 
8%. With the borrowed money he buys $1,200 worth of shoes 
which are delivered on July 1, “Terms 2/10, n/30,” that is, 
2% discount for cash, net up to 30 days, or 6% interest after 
30 days. On Oct. 1, he pays the bank the borrowed money with 
interest at 8%. If Mr. Taylor had allowed his shoe bill to 
remain unpaid until Oct. 1,the wholesaler would have col- 
lected interest at the rate of 6% from July 1. How much does 
Mr. Taylor save by borrowing and paying cash instead of buy-

and pays it back Sept. 1, 1919, with interest at 8%. How 
much did Mr. Clark have to pay? 
3. Mr. Clark used the money on Feb. 10 to buy seeds, 
fertilizers, and implements for his farm. By paying cash he 
got a discount of 5%. How much did Mr, Clark save by bor- 
rowing the $300 instead of buying on credit and paying 6% 
interest to the seed and implement dealer to Sept. Ist? 
4, In finding interest at 6%, some bankers multiply the 
principal by the number of days and divide by 6,000, For
-P-A-G-E-289

example, in finding the interest on $720 at 6% for 75 days, 
the work is as follows: 
$720X75 _ $54000 _ 
6000 6000 
This is sometimes called the Bankers’ Method. 
_ Show that the method is a short cut for the usual longer solu- 
tion: $720X zbyX seo = $9. 
An easy way to divide by 6000 is to point off three more deci- 
mal places and divide by 6. Show why. 
5. If the rate of interest in the problem were 5% instead 
of 6% what part of $9 would you take to get the interest?

193. DOING BUSINESS AT THE BANK 
A bank is an institution that receives and loans money, and ~ 
buys and sells commercial papers. There are various forms _ 
of banks, such as: Federal Reserve Banks, National Banks, 
State Banks, Savings Banks, and Private Banks. In most 
states a Trust Company, which by law may act as administrator, 
executor, and receiver, is also authorized by law to carry on a 
banking business. 
The newest of the above named kinds of banks are the Fed- 
eral Reserve Banks. These are the large central banks of our 
national banking system, whose business it is to issue bank  
-P-A-G-E-291
DOING BUSINESS AT BANK 285 
notes (paper money) and loan money to other banks that are 
members of the Federal Reserve system. 
In order to organize a bank,a group of persons, called stock~ 
holders, furnish the capital stock, or money, necessary to begin 
with. Usually a large number of persons join in furnishing 
the capital stock, which is ordinarily divided into shares of 
$100 each. The stockholders elect a Board of Directors, which 
board elects the officers of the bank—the President, Cashier, etc. 
The officers and directors have active charge of the business 
affairs and policies of the bank. The capital stock is held as 
a guarantee to depositors that money received as deposits will 
be paid when demanded. The deposits constitute the large 
part of the money in a bank, and it is the loaning of the deposits 
that usually makes the banking business profitable.

When a person wishes to begin doing business with a bank, 
he usually opens an account by filling out a deposit slip, as 
shown above, and gives it together with the deposit to the 
teller or cashier. 
1. Who is the depositor? (See deposit slip on page 285.) 
How much does he deposit? When? 
2. What is the name of the bank? Where is it? 
3. What does “currency” mean? 
The depositor is usually asked to write his name and ad- 
dress on a card or in a signature book, so that the bank may have 
his signature on file for purposes of identification. 
A bank book, or pass book, is then given the depositor. This 
book contains the amount and date of the deposit, and should 
be presented with every subsequent deposit in order that re- 
cords of deposits may be made. The book serves as the 
bank’s receipt to the depositor for the deposits. 
A blank check book is also given the depositor to use for 
withdrawing money from the bank. A check should be writ- 
ten plainly in ink, and the number of dollars should be written 
on the “Dollars” line as far to the left as possible and the re- 
mainder of the space filled with a heavy line. These are 
precautions against a possible change of the amount by a dis- 
honest holder. Below is a sample check.

DOING BUSINESS AT BANK 287 
The person who writes the check is the drawer or maker, the 
one to whom the money is to be paid is the drawee or payee. 
1. Who is the drawer in the sample check on preceding 
page? the payee? 
2. For how much is the check drawn? What bank is to 
pay the amount of the check? Where is the bank? 
The words “or order” make it possible for the payee to 
transfer the check to another instead of taking it to the bank 
himself. In transferring it to another, the payee must write 
his name on the back of the check. This is known as indorsing 
a check, and means that the payee guarantees the payment of 
the check. Such indorsement is also required by the bank 
which pays cash for the check. 
If one does not wish to open an account with a bank, but 
wishes to deposit his money for safe-keeping, he is given a 
certificate of deposit as evidence of the deposit, instead of a 
pass book. Such deposit is not subject to check, but may be 
withdrawn upon presentation of the certificate. If left for a 
specified period of time,such deposits usually draw interest. 
Below is a sample of a certificate of deposit.

1. To whom is this certificate payable? When is it pay- 
able? 
2. Would this be called a demand certificate of deposit or 
a time certificate of deposit? (In the one case, the certificate 
is payable upon the demand of the depositor; in the other, 
at a specified time.) 
A promissory note is a written agreement to pay a specified 
amount of money at a specified time or upon demand. It is 
evidence of a loan, or of an unpaid remainder on a purchase. 
The face of the note is the amount to be paid. The parties 
to the agreement are the maker and payee, as in checks; or, 
borrower and lender. Below is a sample note.

-P-A-G-E-295
LOANS AND DISCOUNTS 289 
Checks and notes that may. be transferred and collected by 
some other person or institution than the payee or lender are 
called negotiable papers. Non-negotiable papers are those that 
must be collected by the payee or lender, and are recognized 
by the absence of such words as: “‘the order of,” ‘or order,” etc. 
Indorsement of a negotiable paper is always necessary in order 
to transfer it. When the payee or lender indorses a check or 
note, he promises to pay it if the maker does not. 
195. Loans and Discounts 
When banks loan money for short periods of time, the in- 
terest is usually taken out in advance. 
Interest paid in advance is called bank discount, or discount. 
The maker of the note, or borrower, receives the face of the, 
note less the interest or discount. This remainder is called the 
proceeds. 
1. Mr. Prince borrows $100 at 8% discount at the City 
National Bank May 1, 1920, for 3 mo. How much does Mr. 
Prince get? What is it called? When does he get it? When 
does the bank get back the loan of $100? How long has the 
bank been without its use? How much does the bank make on 
the loan? When does the bank get the interest or discount? 
In some cases interest on a bank loan is not collected in ad-~ 
vance, but paid with the face of the note at the date of matur- 
ity. If the discount is taken out when the loan is made, the 
note will not show any rate of discount, but if not paid when 
due it will begin bearing interest at the legal rate. If interest 
is collected at the date of maturity, the note shows the rate of 
interest. A note may be non-interest bearing, in which case 
it draws no interest unless it remains unpaid at maturity. It 
then draws the legal rate of interest from the date of maturity. 
The term of discount, or the length of time the discount rate

days, agreeing to pay 6% interest. Mr. Hyder holds Mr. 
Walker’s note, but 30 days before the note is due, Mr. Hyder 
finds that he must have the money. He takes the note to the 
First National Bank and offers it for sale. After satisfying 
itself that Mr. Walker and Mr. Hyder are responsible men, the 
bank buys the note. That is, the bank discounts the note 30 
days before it is due, charging 8% rate of discount. Should 
the bank pay Mr. Hyder the full amount of the note at the 
date of its maturity? Note carefully the steps:
-P-A-G-E-297
LOANS AND DISCOUNTS 291 
(1) The bank finds amt. due at maturity: $300X7}yX 
vey = $304.50. 
(2) The bank finds the discount for 30 days on this amt. 
at 8%: $304.50X ro7X ven = $2.03. 
(3) The bank subtracts the discount from the amt. = $302.47, 
(4) The bank pays Mr. Hyder the remainder, or proceeds. 
14, How much would Mr. Hyder have received from Mr. 
Walker at the end of 90 days? How much did he receive 
from the bank? When? Whom will Mr. Walker pay? How 
much? When? How much does the bank make out of the 
transaction? . 
Notre: Banks always discount the maturity value of notes. The Jength of 
time from the date of discount to the date of maturity is called the term of 
discount. The rate of discount is not always the same as the rate of interest 
specified in the note; it is frequently higher. -

196. Making Remittances 
If a person wishes to make a payment to another person 
living in some distant place, he may do so by sending the money 
in a letter, registered or unregistered. Even if registered, it 
may be lost by accident, as by fire, in which case the govern- 
ment would be responsible only up to the value of $50. It 
may be stolen by robbers or employees, in which case the gov- 
ernment would be responsible for amounts over $50 to the 
extent only that it is able to apprehend the guilty person and 
force him to make good the loss. 
There are five commonly used ways’ of making such pay- 
ments. 
(a) The check is a written order drawn by a person, or firm, 
on a bank directing the payment of a specified amount to the 
payee named. 
  If J. L. Clark of Corinth writes a check on his home bank in 
favor of C. L. Horton of Cincinnati, Mr. Horton may take it 
to some bank in Cincinnati and leave it for collection. If the 
Cincinnati bank finds the check good, it will cash the check if 
Mr. Horton can be identified, charging him exchange, a small 
sum for investigating and collecting the check. If Mr. Horton 
is a depositor or customer of a bank in Cincinnati, that bank may
-P-A-G-E-299
MAKING REMITTANCES 293 
accept the check for collection and, if found good, credit Mr. 
Horton’s account with the amount of the check, or pay him 
the cash, without making any exchange charge. 
(b) A banker’s draft is an order, or check, drawn by one 
bank upon another bank directing the payment of a certain 
sum to the payee named. Usually a bank maintains credit, 
or keeps deposits, with other banks, called its correspondents, 
in some larger cities like New Orleans, Atlanta, Chicago, and 
New York. It sells drafts on those deposits and charges a 
small exchange depending in amount upon the face of the draft. 
- The form. of the banker’s draft is shown below:

A commercial or individual draft is an order, or check, drawn 
by one person, firm, or company, called the drawer, upon another 
person, firm, or company, called the drawee, directing the 
payment of a certain sum to the payee named in the order. The 
commercial draft is a very common means of collecting overdue 
accounts. If the Trigg-Meek Co. of Chattanooga has an 
overdue account against John Smith & Co., of Auburn, 
Trigg-Meek Co. may draw a draft on John Smith & Co. in 
favor of Trigg-Meek Co.’s bank in Chattanooga. The form 
of the draft is shown below:
-P-A-G-E-300

Chattanooga Savings Bank </o5= 
Chattanooga, Tem Uiarck 2 219Re 
ee a Greek   
The commercial draft is made payable at sight, or at some 
number of days after sight. It is deposited in Trigg-Meek Co’s. 
local bank. The Chattanooga bank sends it to an Auburn 
bank which presents it to John Smith & Co. If it is a sight 
draft and John Smith & Co. pays it to the Auburn bank, the 
Auburn bank sends the amount, less a fee for collecting, to the 
Chattanooga bank, which bank then pays Trigg-Meek Co. the 
money or credits it to their account. If the draft is a time draft 
and if John Smith & Co. agrees to pay it at the time specified, 
he writes the word “Accepted” and his name and the date 
across the face of the draft. The Auburn bank presents the 
draft again at the indicated time for payment, and remits to 
the Chattanooga bank. Sometimes Trigg-Meek Co., upon 
receiving an order for goods from John Smith & Co. may bill 
the goods to themselves—Trigg-Meek Co.—at Auburn, and send 
the bill of lading and a draft for the amount of the goods to an 
Auburn bank for collection. If John Smith & Co. pays the 
draft, the bank will give him the bill of lading with which he 
may get the goods from the freight agent. In this way Trigg- 
Meek Co. would run no risk in collecting from an unreliable or 
unknown customer.

" INDORSEMENTS 095 
197. Indorsements 
When a person wishes to get the cash on a check, he writes his 
name on the back. If he writes only his name, it is called a 
blank indorsement; if he gives direction as to whom payment is 
to be made and signs his name, it is called an indorsement 
in full; if the indorser is not willing to become responsible for 
payment, that is, pay himself in case the drawer fails to pay, he 
writes the words without recourse, and signs his name. 
Below are samples of the three kinds of indorsements men- 
tioned: :

  To transfer a draft, a check, or a note, any one of the 
above forms of indorsement may be used. 
(c) The postal money order is drawn by one postmaster on 
another and directs payment to a designated payee who must 
be identified in order to get the money. The fees charged for 
the money order are paid to the postmaster issuing it and are 
as follows:
-P-A-G-E-302
296 NEW SCHOOL ARITHMETIC 
For orders for sums not exceeding $ 2.50 3¢ 
For orders over $2.50. and not exceeding 5.00 5¢ 
For orders over 5.00 and not exceeding 10.00 8¢ 
For orders over 10.00 and not exceeding 20.00 10¢ 
For orders over 20.00 and not exceeding 30.00 12¢ 
For orders over 30.00 and not exceeding 40.00 15¢ 
For orders over 40.00 and not exceeding 50.00 18¢ 
For orders over 50.00 and not exceeding 60.00 20¢ 
For orders over 60.00 and not exceeding 75.00 25¢ 
For orders over 75.00 and not exceeding 100.00 30¢ 
It is not necessary that the money paid to one postmaster 
actually be sent to the other postmaster. The United States 
government merely receives the money at one post office and 
pays at another. 
(d) The express money order is an order from one of the com- 
pany’s agents to another to pay a specified amount to a desig- 
nated payee. The fees are approximately the same as those 
given for post-office money orders. 
{e) The telegraphic money order is an order by wire from 
one of the company’s agents to another to pay a specified amount 
to a person named in the telegram. The fees depend upon the 
distance between the offices involved. This method of send- 
ing money is used when haste is desired, and the fees are higher 
than for other kinds of drafts and orders.

199. STOCKS AND BONDS 
W. J. Souder wishes to have a creamery in his community. 
He considers three ways of operating it. First, he might put 
in all the money needed to provide the buildings, grounds and 
equipment, and manage the business himself, hiring whatever 
help he needs at so much per day. Second, he might persuade 
one or two of his neighbors to join him, the two or three men 
to be partners, each paying in a part of the money needed to 
equip and operate the plant. For example, if Mr. Cox and 
Mr. Sanders join Mr. Souder in the business, the three men 
would be partners and form a partnership. The firm name 
might be Souder, Cox & Sanders. Third, Mr. Souder might get 
several of his neighbors to join him and elect a board of directors 
for the transaction of the business, These directors would secure 
a charter under the laws of the state, which would empower the 
organization to transact business as an individual. Such an 
organization is called a corporation. 
Let us suppose that $6,000 will be necessary to equip the 
plant and start the creamery. This amount is called capital. 
If Mr. Souder furnishes all the capital and manages the business 
alone, he would be entitled to all the profits; and if the creamery 
failed to succeed, Mr. Souder would be liable for all the debts. 
If Souder, Cox & Sanders go into the business on an equal 
basis, each would furnish $2,000 of the capital, and each would 
share + of the profits, or + of the debts if the business failed. 
The law also provides that all the partners are bound by the 
acts of any one of them in connection with the business, and 
that in case of a failure if some of the partners are unable to 
pay their share of the debts, the member or members of the 
firm able to pay must pay the ‘debts of the entire firm. 
If Mr. Souder persuades 29 of his neighbors to join him in 
the creamery, the 30 men would probably organize themselves 
into a stock company or corporation according to laws prescribed
-P-A-G-E-305
STOCKS AND BONDS 299 
by the state. A few of the men would be elected directors 
to have active charge of the creamery. 
The $6000 capital stock might be divided into 60 equal shares. 
Each share would have a par value of $100. The net profits of 
the business would be divided among the 30 stock-holders as 
dividends, and in case of a failure in business the law provides 
that no stock-holder shall be liable for more than the face value 
of his stock. 
If Mr. Martin, one of the stock-holders, wishes to sell his 
stock after the business has been in operation for some time, he 
might get more or less than $100 per share, depending upon the 
degree of success of the business and the consequent size of 
the dividends likely to be declared. That is, the stock might 
sell above par or below par. 
200. Problems 
1. Souder, Cox, and Sanders form a partnership, each 
putting in $2000. If the profits above expenses are $900, how 
much should each of the partners receive in profits? 
2. If Souder puts in $3000, Cox $2000, and Sanders $1000, 
how much should each receive of the $900 profits? 
3. Suppose Souder, Cox, and Sanders should put in $2500, 
$2000, and $1500 respectively, how should $800 in profits be 
divided among them? 
4, A,B, C,and D formed a partnership. A put in $1200; 
B, $1500; C, $1300; and D, $2500. If the profits are $1000, 
how much of the profits should each partner get? 
5. What are the advantages of the stock company over 
the individual or partnership method of carrying on a business 
which depends upon co-operation for its success? 
6. If Mr. Mart sells two shares to Mr. Smith, who already 
owns two shares, what part of the dividends should Mr. Smith 
then get, if the capital stock is $6000?
-P-A-G-E-306
300 NEW SCHOOL ARITHMETIC 
7. Suppose Mr. Souder had found 120 persons who were in- 
terested in the creamery and had divided the $6000 capital 
stock into 120 equal shares, what would the par value of each 
share be? 
8. Find the par value of 10 shares if there are 240 shares 
of the entire capital stock of $6000. 
9. (a) Suppose the creamery should make a net profit of 
$500 above all expenses, what per cent of the capital stock is the 
net profit? 
(b) Find the dividend that should be paid a stock-holder 
who owns I share with a par value of $50; 6 shares; 10 shares. 
If one person carries on a business of any kind alone he 
is responsible for all the debts, and is entitled to all the profits of 
the business. If two or more persons engage in a business 
together they may form a partnership, which is usually known 
by a firm name. The partners have an agreement as to the 
services, money, etc., contributed by each, and as to the share 
of the profits each is to receive. The business acts of any one 
member of the firm bind all members of the firm, and each is 
personally liable for the entire indebtedness of the firm. 
If the persons engaging in a business wish to limit their 
financial responsibility to the extent of their investment only, 
and if a large number of persons wish to make investments in 
money but not in personal services, a stock company or cor-~ 
poration is organized. This organization usually carries on 
business on a larger scale than a partnership, and requires a 
larger capital. The organization is formed under state laws, 
and has the same legal rights and responsibilities as an indi- 
vidual. It may buy and sell property, sue and be sued for 
debts, etc. 
The Articles of Incorporation, which must be available to 
the public, state the purposes of the corporation, the capital 
stock, the number of shares into which it is divided, the par
-P-A-G-E-307
STOCKS AND BONDS “301 
value of each share, the number of shares each stock-holder 
owns etc. Certificates of stock are issued to the stock-holders: 
as evidence of the number of shares owned and the amount paid® 
into the treasury. The owner of each certificate is entitled to® 
participate in the profits, and to have a voice in the election of | 
directors, who in turn elect the officers to have active charge © 
of the business. 
If the business is prosperous, a part of the profits is usually 
distributed among the stock-holders as dividends. Ifthe busi- 
ness is carried on at a loss, it may be advisable to make an as-. 
sessment upon each stock-holder in proportion to the number of 
shares owned. Some stock is by law non-assessable, in which 
case the holder cannot be assessed. Dividends and assess- 
ments are usually expressed as so many per cent of the face 
value of the stock. 
Sometimes a corporation issues preferred stock, in which 
case the other stock is called common stock. Holders of pre- 
ferred stock have first chance on the profits and receive a fixed 
rate of dividend if that amount is earned. Dividends on com- 
mon stock are paid out of the profits remaining after preferred 
dividends are paid, if any such profits remain. 
When the dividend rates amount to a higher rate per cent on 
the face value of the stock than the prevailing rates of interest, 
the stock will sell for more than its face value. The stock is 
then said to be above par, or at a premium, If the dividend 
rates are less than the average interest rates, the stock will sell 
for less than its face value, and is said to be below par, or ata 
discount. The market value of stock is usually stated as so 
many per cent of the face value. It is sometimes stated, how- 
ever, as so many dollars per share, the face value of a share 
being $100 unless otherwise specified. 
When a corporation wishes to borrow money,it may issue _ 
and sell bonds, which are really interest bearing notes with 
the property of the corporation as security. Bonds are issued 
   
-P-A-G-E-308

similarly by the national government, by states, by counties, 
by cities, by special school districts, etc., which are recognized 
by law as corporations. Such bonds bear a specified rate of 
interest, and the corporation redeems them by means of taxa- - 
tion, usually through a sinking fund set apart specifically for 
the purpose. 
The chief differences between shares of stock and bonds are: 
(1) A share of stock is evidence of ownership of property, 
while a bond is a note whose payment is guaranteed by the 
property; : 
(2) The income from a share of stock depends upon the 
earnings of the corporation, while a bond bears a fixed rate of 
interest; 
(3) A dividend on a share of stock is not due until declared 
so by the officers and directors, while the interest on a bond is 
due and payable at fixed intervals of time. 
When bonds are made payable to the owner or some one to 
whom he may transfer them, they are registered on the books 
of the company and are called registered bonds. When they 
are made payable to bearer, the interest is paid upon presenta- 
tion at the proper time of attached coupons, and the bonds are 
called coupon bonds. 
Persons who make it their business to keep closely in touch 
with the market conditions affecting corporation stocks and 
bonds for the purpose of advising others and of buying and 
selling stocks and bonds for others are called brokers. 
The fee charged by the broker is called brokerage. It is 
always a certain per cent of the face value of the stock, and is 
practically always $%, either for buying or selling. 
Persons who make their business that of dealing in stocks and 
* bonds usually form an organization known as a stock exchange. 
These exchanges are located in the larger cities, where brokers 
buy and sell for customers in all parts of the country.

Stock quotations may be found in most daily newspapers, in 
financial journals, and in various commercial reports. A 
quotation of 125, for example, means that a share of the stock, 
whose face value is $100, will sell for $125 plus the brokerage 
which is usually 4% of $100.00, or 123¢. That is, a share of 
the stock will cost $125.124 if a man is buying, and will bring 
$124.874 ($125 —0.124) if a man is selling.

pon bonds were issued in denominations of various sizes from 
$50 to $1000, and registered bonds in sizes from $100 to

NATIONAL FARM LOAN 309 
203. NATIONAL FARM LOAN ASSOCIATIONS % 
Organization 
1. By the Federal laws a national farm loan association 
may be organized in any community where ten or more cit- 
izens owning land desire to borrow money from the government . 
equal to a total amount not less than $25,000. Individual 
loans may be as small as $100 or as large as $25,000. . 
2. Each citizen who joins must pay as a subscription to 
the stock of the association 5% of the loan he secures. This is 
held by the local association as security until the farmer pays 
his debt, when the 5% subscription is returned to him. All 
members of the association must be applicants for loans. 
3. Federal land banks have been established throughout 
the country for the purpose of carrying the law into effect. — 
4, The following table shows the number designating each 
Federal land bank district, the states included in the district, 
and the cities in which the banks are located.

204. Limitations 
1. No loan may be made except upon the security of first 
mortgages. . 
2. The amount of the mortgage cannot exceed one-half 
the appraised value of the land and 20% of the permanent 
improvements thereon, which must be insured. 
3. The proceeds of the loan must be used for the extin- 
guishment of pre-existing indebtedness or for productive pur- 
poses which include the purchase of live stock, fertilizers, 
equipment, and improvements. : 
4, Every mortgage must contain an agreement to pay off 
the debt (principal and interest) in fixed annual or semi-annual 
instalments. 
6. The amount of each instalment may be fixed by the 
borrower, but cannot be less than sufficient to pay off the debt 
in 40 years, nor greater than to pay it off in 5 years. 
6. The rate of interest charged any borrower cannot ex- 
ceed 6% per annum. 
7. The borrower cannot be called upon to pay the debt 
except by the instalments he originally fixes unless he defaults, 
but after five years he may pay off the whole or any portion at 
his option at any instalment period. Under the amortization 
plan, the term of the loan and the amount of each instalment 
are relative; determining one fixes the other. 
205. Amortization 
1. Amortization is the term applied to the process of paying 
off an indebtedness by instalment payments of a fixed amount, 
which includes interest and a part of the principal, throughout 
a period of years. Amortization means killing mortgages. 
2. The Federal Farm Loan Board has encouraged the 
Federal Land Banks in establishing a standard 35-year loan. 
It has done this because this sort of loan is one which simplifies
-P-A-G-E-317
NATIONAL FARM LOAN 311 
the bookkeeping, makes the matter of payments and amortiza- 
tion plain to everybody, and gives every borrower ample oppor- 
tunity to adjust his business affairs. It spreads the privi- 
lege of payment over a generation in time, and meets every 
want of almost every borrower. 
3. The following amortization tables have been approved 
by the Federal Farm Loan Board for the use of the land banks 
and for the guidance of farmers who borrow under this system.

MAKING PAYMENTS 313 
206. Making Additional Payments 
1. The Federal Farm Loan Act gives the farmer the privi-, 
lege of paying any amount he wishes, from $25 up, to be applied 
on the principal of his loan after the lapse of five years, on the 
date of any payment called for by his contract.. Table III 
shows how such payments reduce the amount of the loan and 
shorten the term. :

    2. The advantages of using this method of paying off ahead 
of time are perfectly plain to any borrower. The amount of 
interest paid is reduced from $1,272.50, under the regular amor- 
tized 35-year loan, to $768.78, or a saving of $503.72 interest.

211. FOUNDATION WALLS AND BASEMENT FLOORS 
Cellar and basement walls are usually extended below the 
surface of the ground to a depth depending upon the height of 
the building. Such walls are called foundation walls. Walls 
that are intended principally to withhold a bank of earth are 
called retaining walls; 
Materials for these walls may be brick, stone, or concrete. 
Brick is used extensively in dry soils and for partition walls. 
Concrete is used in damp soils because it withstands the de- 
teriorating effects of water. . 
The thickness of foundation walls depends upon their depth 
and the height of the building they support. In large cities 
the thickness and depth of foundation walls are fixed by law. 
For a two-story house, the thickness of a brick foundation 
wall is usually 12 in. to 16 in. If the construction material is’ 
stone or concrete, the thickness is about 20 in. 
When we estimate the labor and the number of bricks in the 
walls of a house, outside dimensions of the walls are usually 
taken. This means that the corners are counted twice, but 
because of the extra labor in laying them, this method of com- 
puting is considered fair to both employer and employee; and 
because of wastage by breaking, etc., the allowance for double 
material in corners is made. 
; 1. A common brick is 8 in. by 4in. by 2in. How many 
cubic inches are there in its volume? How many common 
bricks could be laid in 1 cu. ft. of space? 
2. After allowance is made for the space taken up by the 
mortar, 22 bricks are counted to 1 cu. ft. of wall. How many 
bricks are there in a brick wall 40 ft. long, 6 ft. high and 16 in. 
thick? 
3. If the house is 24 ft. wide, 28 ft. long, and if the brick 
foundation is 12 in. thick and extends 8 ft. below the first floor 
beams of the house, find the number of bricks in the foundation.

212. LONGITUDE AND TIME 
You have learned in your geography 
that the earth is a sphere which re- 
volves on its axis like a top and that 
it makes one complete revolution from 
west to east in 24 hr. In making a 
complete revolution, the earth de- 
scribes a circle. A circle contains 
360°, Hence 24 hr. of time  cor- 
responds to 360° of longitude. 
  1 hr. of time corresponds to 94 of 360° =15°. 
1 min. of time corresponds to gy of 15°=}°=15' 
1 sec. of time corresponds to gy of 15’=}/=15". 
Thus we see the number of hours, minutes, and seconds of 
time is z’s of the number of degrees, minutes, and seconds of 
longitude; or the number of degrees, minutes, and seconds of 
longitude is 15 times the number of hours, minutes, and seconds 
of time. Hence, to find the difference in longitude multiply 
the difference in time by 15; to find the difference in time divide 
the difference in longitude by 15. ,

213. Measuring Longitude 
In measuring longitude you must have some meridian for a 
‘starting point, and number all other meridians east and west 
of that principal meridian. The meridian passing through 
Greenwich, in England, has been accepted by astronomers of 
different countries as the prime meridian. In Figure J. the 
heavy shaded meridian represents the prime meridian,

214. International Date Line 
If you were to start westward from Washington to travel 
around the world, and should keep correct solar time, you would 
set your watch back 1 hr. every time you passed over 15°. 
‘You would find on reaching Washington at the completion of 
your journey that you had set your watch back 24 times. Hence, 
you would be 24 hr., or 1 da., behind the calendar. If you had 
traveled eastward, you would have set your watch forward 24 
times, and on your return you would be 1 da. ahead of the 
calendar. 
To adjust the calendar,a somewhat irregular line called the
-P-A-G-E-333
LONGITUD® AND TIME 327 
International Date Line has been established. This line fol- 
lows approximately the 180th meridian. 
A vessel going westward changes its calendar forward 1 da. 
in crossing the line. If the vessel is going eastward, the 
calendar is set back 1 da. on crossing this line. 
2165. Standard Time 
For the convenience of the railroads, standard time was 
established in 1883. According to the agreement, the United 
States is divided into four divisions or time belts. 
The Eastern time is the solar time of the 75th meridian; the 
Central time of the 90th meridian; the Mountain time of the 
105th meridian; the Pacific time of the 120th meridian. 
These meridians pass approximately through the center of 
each belt. Each time belt represents time 1 hr. earlier than 
the adjacent belt to the east. 
It will be noted that the boundaries of the time belts do not 
follow exactly the meridians. This is because the boundary . 
lines are influenced by important railroad terminals.

@) 12+6 = ig = 12:6 
(2) Quotient = Fraction = Ratio 
@) Dividend Numerator —_ Antecedent 
Divisor ~ Denominator _ Consequent 
Read (1), (2), (3), above. 
2. All of the terms and expressions above have been used 
frequently, heretofore, except those under (c). The expres- 
sion, 12 : 6, is called a ratio. It is read, the ratio of 12 to 6. 
It expresses a relation between two numbers heretofore ex- 
pressed in the form of a fraction or a division. We may think 
of these three symbols as indicating division: first, (+),used 
between dividend and divisor, as 12-6; second, (—), used be- 
tween numerator and denominator, as +2; and third, (: ), 
used between-antecedent and consequent, as 12 : 6. 
Note that the ratio symbol is made of two dots, the fraction 
symbol of a dash, and the division symbol of two dots and a 
dash. It is thought that the symbol for division that was 
first used consisted of two dots (: ).

219. . Simple Proportion 
An equality of two ratios is called a proportion, as 12: 6= 
14:7. 
The proportion may be written 42=14. Why? Formerly, 
it was frequently written 12:6: :14:7, but this form is - 
rapidly disappearing. : 
The proportion may be read, The ratio of 12 to 6 equals the 
ratio of 140 7, or 12 is to 6 as 14 is to 7. 
The proportion consists of four terms, two antecedents and 
two consequents. Name the two antecedents and the two 
consequents in 12 : 6=14: 7. 
The four terms are called in order from left to right: first, 
second, third, and fourth. The first and fourth are the ex- 
tremes, and the second and third terms are the means. 
1. Find the product of the extremes. 
2. Find the product of the means. 
3. How do the two products compare? 
4. Compare the products of extremes and of means in 
these proportions: 
(a) 3:6=5:10 (c) 18:3=30:5 
(b) 1:3=7:21 (d) 2$:5=4:8 
In every proportion, the product of the extremes is equal to the 
product of the means. 
This is called the fundamental principle of proportion. It 
may be used to test proportions where all of the four terms 
are proposed.

220. Levers 
In lifting a weight of 100 lb. without the aid of a machine, a 
man employs a force of 100 Ib. If we think of the weight as 
resistance and the force as effort, we may say the resistance 
‘is overcome by the effort. 
By use of a simple machine, known as a lever, the man may ~ 
reduce the effort necessary to overcome the resistance. A
-P-A-G-E-342

lever is a rigid bar supported at a point about which it may 
move freely. 
There are three classes of lever: 
  In these illustrations, the fulcrum is the point about which 
the lever moves freely. 
1. Now suppose the man who wishes to raise 100 Ib. should 
fasten the weight on one end of a bar 8 ft. long, support the 
bar with a fulcrum 3 ft. from the weight, and at the other end 
of the bar exert the force necessary to balance the lever. He 
would find that he could balance the weight with a force of 60 © 
‘Tb., and raise the weight with a force of slightly more than 
60 Ib.
-P-A-G-E-343
  SIMPLE. PROPORTION 337 
This is called a lever of the first class. (See Class I above). 
Examples of this class of lever are the crow-bar, used as a pry, 
the see-saw, etc. 
2. If the man had supported the bar at one end with the 
fulcrum and had fastened the weight 3 ft. from the fulcrum, he 
could have balanced the lever by a force of 374 Ib., and have 
raised the weight with a force slightly more than 374 Ib. 
This is called a lever of the second class. Examples of this 
class of lever are the ordinary bar when used as indicated, 
nut crackers, lemon squeezers, etc. 
3. If the man should fix the end of the bar under the ful- 
crum, place the weight at the other end of the bar and apply 
the force at a point 3 ft. from the fulcrum, he would have to 
exert a force of 2663 lb. to keep the bar in balance, and slight- 
ly more than that to raise the weight. 
This is called a lever of the third class. Examples of this 
class of lever are the fore-arm raising a weight in the extended 
hand, the elbow being the fulcrum and the muscles of the fore- 
arm the force; the door when being pushed near the hinge, etc. 
4. In which direction, upward or downward, is the effort 
exerted in the first class lever? in the second class? in the third 
class? 
The law of the lever is expressed in the following proportion: 
¥F : W=Wa: Fa; in which F stands for force, W for weight, 
Wa for the distance from the fulcrum to the point where the 
weight is applied, and Fa the distance from the fulcrum to 
the point where the force is applied. 
5. Use the proportion in [4],andshow how the result in 
{1] above was found. 
Solution: F : W=Wa: Fa.

When two or more men associate themselves together for the 
transaction of business they form a partnership. Each one 
entering into the agreement is called a partner. The partner- 
ship is called a firm, company or house. The amount of money 
invested is the capital. The gains and losses are shared by alt 
the members of the company in proportion to the amount of 
money each has invested.

When two parties agree to exchange property, or to carry 
out a business transaction, or the one agrees to render or receive 
a service from the other for a consideration, a contract is en- 
tered into. If the transaction involves a large amount of money 
or if it is to be executed at some future date, the agreement is 
generally reduced to a concise written form, and is signed by 
both parties whose signatures are usually witnessed. If one 
party makes a business proposition in a letter and the other 
party accepts the proposition by letter, it makes in effect a 
written contract. / 
There is no fixed form for written contracts, but they are 
often written somewhat like the following:

225. Finding the Net Cost by Taking Off a Single Discount 
Equivalent to Two Discounts 
Instead of taking off two discounts separately, a single dis- 
count equivalent to the two may be found first and the two 
taken off the list price in a single operation. 
For example, if the two discounts of 25% and 20% are al- 
lowed, it is easily seen that after the first one is taken off, the 
cost is 75% of the list price; and that after 20% or + of 75%, 
which is 15%, is taken off, 60% of the list price remains as the 
final cost, or net cost. That is, 100% of the first list price— 
25% of the first list price=75% of the first list price; and, 
75% of the first list price—20% of this remainder=60% of 
the list price, or net cost. 
Note: The order of taking off successive discounts is immaterial. 
This process may be shortened by the following rule: 
From the sum of the two discounts subtract their product, and 
take the result from 100%. 
That is, 100% — (25% + 20% — 25% X 20%) 
=1.00 —(.25+.20—.25 x .20) 
=1.00 —(.45—.05) 
=1.00 —.40 
=1.00 —.40 
= .60, or 60%.

226. Annual Interest 
Annual Interest is simple interest on the principal increased 
by simple interest on the unpaid interest from the date it is 
cue till the date of settlement. 
In some states annual interest is permitted, but in others it 
is prohibited by law. In order to avoid any conflict with the 
law, a non-interest bearing note is sometimes drawn up for the 
principal, and also a note for the unpaid interest of each year 
or interest period. These latter notes are called interest notes.

227. Compound Interest and Savings Banks 
  Every boy and girl should form the habit of saving money. 
Have you any money in the savings bank? Did you buy any 
Thrift Stamps? 
~ Not only are you saving your money when you buy Thrift 
Stamps or deposit your money in a savings bank, but your 
money is increasing by the interest it earns. And, better 
still, not only is the money you actually invest earning more 
money, but the interest is added to your investment at the 
end of a certain period of time, thus increasing the interest- 
bearing principal. This new principal is the sum of the in- 
terest and principal, or the amount, at the close of the interest 
period, and continues to increase similarly with each suc- 
ceeding interest period. This is really interest on the prin- 
cipal'and unpaid interest, combined at given intervals of time. 
It is called compound interest. 
You may open an account, and begin your savings bank by

depositing $1 or more. You will be given a book in which the 
amount of your deposit is written. This book must always be 
taken to the bank when you wish to deposit or withdraw money 
so that the deposits or withdrawals may be entered in it. It 
really serves as a receipt book between you and the bank,

On the preceding page is a section of a compound interest 
table, showing the amount of $1 at compound ‘interest for any 
number of intervals from 1 to 12. 
Most intervals, or periods, are 6 mo., that is, the interest is 
compounded semi-annually. 
To illustrate: $1 at compound interest for 2 years at 4%, compounded 
semi-annually, runs through 4 (half-year) periods with a rate of 2% (4 of 4%) 
foreach period. Hence, under the 2% column and opposite the 4th period we 
find the amount, $1.08243, 
To find the amount for any number of dollars, multiply the 
amount of $1 by the number of dollars. For example, in 
Problem 1 above, the time and rate were the same as in the 
illustration just given; hence, to find the amount for $100, 
$1.08243 x 100 =$108.243, which result agrees with that 
reached in the problem. 
By the use of the table solve the following problems: 
2. Find the amount of $630 for 3 years at 5%, interest 
payable semi-annually, 
3. Mary deposits $10 in a savings bank on her 12th birth- 
day. The bank pays 4% compound interest, payable semi- 
annually. How much will it amount to by the time Mary is 
17 years old? 
4. If Mary had put $10 in the bank on each of her birth- 
days from the 12th to the 16th, how much would Mary have in 
the bank on her sixteenth birthday? 
_ 5. Find the difference between the amount of $100 at 
simple interest for 10 years at 5%, and the ‘amount of $100 
deposited in a savings bank that pays 5% compound interest, 
payable annually, for 10 years. 
6. What amount will you have in the bank if you deposit 
$5 on your 14th birthday, and $5 every six months thereafter, 
until you are 20 years old, if the bank pays compound interest 
at 4%, semi-annually?

228, _ FARM ACCOUNTS - 
Every farmer has some idea of the cost of producing farm 
products and on what particular products he makes the greatest 
profits, but few keep accurate records that show just exactly 
“the profit or loss on the various farm products. 
It is not necessary to apply strict methods of bookkeeping 
to farm accounts, but sufficient records should be kept to enable 
the farmer to know definitely how much he is making or losing 
on a field, a crop, farm animals, or any other farm products. 
A convenient form for keeping accounts is a double page for 
each person, firm, field, crop, etc. On the left-hand page are 
written the charge items, or what is paid out. On the right- 
hand page are written the credit items, or what is received. 
Or, a single page may be ruled so that there is a left-hand side 
and a right-hand side on the same page. Of course, the double 
page arrangement gives more room for details concerning each 
item.

GOVERNMENT LIFE INSURANCE 355 
229. GOVERNMENT LIFE INSURANCE 
(Selected from Bulletin L.D. 9, Bureau of War Risk Insurance.) 
The Origin of Government Insurance in U. S. 
When this country entered the World War, the need was at 
once felt for some liberal method of protection for the soldiers 
and their families. Congress realized that a man could fight 
better if he carried no fear in his heart for his loved ones’ 
future should he die or become so disabled that he could 
no longer support his family or himself. Congress also 
realized that many men would come out of the war so impaired. 
in mind or body that they could not pass a life insurance exam- 
ination. This was the origin of Government Life Insurance in 
the United States, 
The Principle of Life Insurance. 
The general principle of insurance of any kind is the group- 
ing together of many people to protect each other against pos- 
sible loss. This principle can be better understood if we take 
fire insurance as an example. The risk of a fire may be slight, 
but the loss, if it does occur, may be very heavy, and if borne by 
one person alone it might mean financial ruin. When this loss 
is shared by thousands of others, no individual suffers, for each 
one pays a premium which from experience has been found to 
be sufficient to meet the loss by fire on any one or more of the 
houses insured. ‘This same principle is the foundation of life 
insurance, though in a more complicated form. 
Protection Lost Sight of. 
Many who carry life insurance do not seem to realize that, if 
they fortunately go on living from year to year, they have been 
just as surely protected against loss through death as by their
-P-A-G-E-362
356 NEW SCHOOL ARITHMETIC 
fire insurance their houses have been protected against loss 
through fire, and where they have only paid the exact cost of 
their death protection year by year they are no more entitled 
to the return of any part of their life insurance premiums than 
they are entitled to the return of any part of their fire insurance 
premiums when their houses do not burn. 
The premiums for War Term Insurance increase year by 
year, and if carried for an indefinite period beyond the limit 
allowed by the Government (of five years after the termination 
of the war as declared by proclamation of the President) it 
would not be long before they would reach a point where the 
men could not pay them. 
The United States Government offered opportunity at any 
time, during the five years following the declaration of peace by 
proclamation of the President, to convert War Term Insurance 
to any one or any combination of the six permanent plans of 
U. S. Government Insurance, with premiums which do not 
increase, but which will decrease if dividends are earned in the 
future. 
The following are the six forms of U. S. Government Life In- 
surance: . . 
(1) Ordinary Life. 
(2) Twenty-payment Life. 
(8) Thirty-payment Life. 
(4) Twenty-year Endowment. 
(5) Thirty-year Endowment. 
(6) Endowment maturing at age 62.

quantities without making the actual computations, lines 
drawn to a convenient scale are frequently used. Such lines 
are called graphs. Thus, if train A runs 30 miles an hour

  CONCRETE CONSTRUCTION 369 
233. CONCRETE CONSFRUCTION 
One of the most important materials used in construction 
work.at the present is concrete. 
” Concrete may be defined as an artificial stone prepared by 
mixing cement, sand, and pebbles or broken stone in certain 
proportions, depending upon the nature of the work for which 
the concrete is to be used. 
Concrete is used for a variety of purposes, such as building 
streets, roads, bridges, sidewalks, houses, foundations for build- 
ings, silos, ete. 
  Cement is usually put up in standard packages (cloth sacks 
and paper bags) weighing 94 pounds net and considered as 1 
cubic foot when proportioning mixtures by volume, which is 
the common method.
-P-A-G-E-376
370 NEW SCHOOL ARITHMBTIC 
Four sacks of cement make one barrel. In the process of 
making the mixture for concrete, a sack of cement and the pro- 
portion of sand desired are thoroughly mixed and then the 
proper proportion of gravel or crushed stone is added and these 
three elements are thoroughly mixed together. This mixture 
is called a batch. The proper amount of water is then added 
to the mixture and thoroughly stirred. The concrete mixture 
is put into a frame or form where it hardens and takes the per- 
manent shape of the containing form. 
It is highly important that the sand be free from dirt and 
other foreign matter and that the gravel or stone be of the 
proper size, The amount of cement used ina 1:2:4 mixture, 
for instance, is 1 cu. ft. (one sack) of cement, 2 cu. ft. of sand, 
4 cu. ft. of pebbles or crushed stone. In this book, the mixtures 
are arranged in the order: cement, sand, stone, 
Read and explain the following mixtures: 1:2:3; 1:1:1; 
1: 4:14; 1:83:65; 1:24:45 1:2; 1:24.

Why would not 1 cu. ft. of cement, 1 cu. ft. of sand, and 1 
cu. ft. of stone make a volume of 3 cu. ft. of mixture? Suppose 
you take a quart measure full of pebbles and see if you cannot 
put some coarse sand in it without taking out any pebbles. 
After putting in all the sand you can without taking out any 
pebbles, see if you cannot put in some cement which is much 
finer than sand; then see if the can will not hold some water. 
This experiment will show you why a 1:2:3 mixture makes only 
3.9 cu. ft. of concrete instead of 6 cu. ft. 
Suppose you measure a sidewalk made of 1:2:3 mixture and 
find it to be 24 ft. long, 5 ft. wide, and 4 in. thick. How many 
cubic feet of concrete in the walk? How much cement? sand? 
stone? Length breadth Xthickness equals number of units 
of volume. 
24'X5’X4/=40 number of cubic feet 
Since it takes a 1:2:3 mixture (6 cu. ft.) to make 3.9 cu. ft. 
concrete, it can readily be seen that to get the number of 
batches you would divide 40 cu. ft. by 3.9, the number of 
cubic feet made from one mixture; then multiply the quotient 
by the proportionate part representing each element of the 
mixture. 
Thus: No. batches of concrete =40+3.9 
No. sacks of cement =1X (40+3.9) 
No. cubic feet of sand =2X (40+3.9) 
No. cubic feet of stone =3X (40+3.9)

A body that has length, breadth, and thicknessis called a solid. 
The surfaces bounding a solid are called its faces. 
The area of the Iaces of a solid is called its lateral surface. 
The volume of a solid is the number of times it contains its 
unit of measure. 
The unit of measure for solids is the cubic inch, cubic foot, 
or cubic yard. 
A solid whose faces are rectangles and whose bases are equal 
and parallel polygons is called a prism. 
Such prisms are named from the number of equal sidesfound in

The surface of a sphere is equal to the convex surface of a cylinder 
whose height and diameter are the same as the diameter of the 
sphere. : 
The truth of this statement is demonstrated in geometry. 
This can be shown by taking a cylinder with a diameter of 
6 in. and altitude of 6 in. and a sphere whose diameter is 6 in. 
and comparing their surfaces thus: Wind a cord around the 
cylinder till it iscovered. Unwind the cord from the cylinder 
on to the sphere as shown in the figure on page 389. 
When the cord is unwound the distance of 3 inches or 4 the 
altitude of the cylinder, it covers 4 the surface of the sphere. 
1. Find the convex surface of a cylinder the diameter of 
whose base is 6 in. and whose height is 6 in., or of a sphere whose 
diameter is 6 in. 
Convex surface of cylinder=cXh.

The figure shows the two kinds of ther- 
mometers most used by the leading coun- 
tries. The Fahrenheit thermometer is in 
common use in all English speaking coun- 
tries. The Centigrade thermometer is in 
general use in science. 
The Fahrenheit scale for measuring tem- 
perature was introduced by Fahrenheit 
about 1714. He believed the lowest pos- 
sible degree of cold was obtained by mixing 
salt and snow. He called this 0° on the 
scale, and the boiling point 212°. The 
scale was divided into 212 equal parts 
called degrees. The freezing point was 
then found to be 32°, thus making 180° 
between the freezing and boiling points. 
The Centigrade scale was designed by 
Celsius in 1742. He fixed the freezing 
point at 0° and the boiling point at 100°, thus 
making 100° between the freezing and boil- 
ing points. : 
Since the same difference in tempera- 
ture (boiling point—freezing point) is di- 
vided into a greater number of equal parts 
on the Fahrenheit scale, it follows that a 
given number of degrees Centigrade is 
equivalent to a greater number Fahrenheit. 
In changing from degrees Centigrade to 
degrees Fahrenheit, we find a greater num- 
ber of degrees, and in changing from degrees 
Fahrenheit to degrees Centigrade we finda 
fewer number of degrees.

given number of degrees from one scale to the other:

@) 2 C=2°F Why? (I) 1° R=3°C. Why? 
1. Ifthe readings above 0° on either scale are written thus, 
+4° C., +25° F., etc., how should we write the readings if 
they were the same distance below 0°? 
2. Besides being signs of operation for addition and sub- 
traction, (+) and (—) are used to denote quantities above 
and below 0 in value. Point out on the scales in the figure: 
-+50° F.; +45° C.; —3° F.; —4°C. 
3. Change to Fahrenheit equivalents: 
(a) 80° C.; (b) 45° C.; (c) 55° C.; (d) 18°C. 
Suggestion: Since 1° C.=$°F., 80°C.=80 x2° F. 
4, Change to Centigrade equivalents: 
(a) 45° F.; (b) 36° F.: (c) 27°F.; (d) 81°F. 
Suggestion: Since 1° F.=$°C., 45° F.=45x8°C. 
5. In the exercises above, we have been dealing with degrees 
_ and not with readings. To change thermometer readings from 
one scale to another,account must be taken of the different 
positions of 0° on the two scales. 
Suppose the reading on the F. scale is 41°. Since 32° F.= 
O° C., if we take 32° from 41° the remaining 9° will correspond 
to so many degrees above 0° on the C.'scale. By formula (I), 
1° F.=#° C., the reading will be, 9° F.=9X$°=5° C. 
Why?

Could we use the short way for (b) in Problem 1? Why? 
The principle of addition, as well as of all other operations, 
is the same in our monetary and linear systems. In each, we 
find the sum of the numbers under the lowest order, find how 
many this sum makes of the next higher order, write what re- 
mains under the lowest order, and carry the number of the next 
higher order up to its place, etc., until the sum is expressed in 
integral numbers of the highest orders possible. But because 
the scale in linear measure is not decimal or uniform, the actual 
process is more complicated.

in operations with the Hindu-Arabic system for the reason 
388 that carrying has become automatic, which fact is one of the 
16 7 __ strongest arguments for the metric system.   
246. History 
About 1783 a great English scientist, named James Watt, 
who invented the steam engine, designed a system of units of 
weights and measures decimally related. The French govern- 
ment adopted the system in 1799. 
The system is based upon the meter, which is a unit of length 
equal to pyavvvee Of the distance from the equator to the 
north pole along the meridian passing through Paris. While a 
slight error was made in securing this standard unit, the science 
and usefulness of the system are in no sense affected. 
This system is now used by nearly all civilized nations ex- 
cept the United States and Great Britain. Its use is required in 
some of the government departments of the United States, and 
officially permitted in others. By direction of law, all our 
common units of weights and measures are standardized by 
comparison with the international standards kept at the Inter- 
national Bureau of Weights and Measures near Paris. 
Some of the advantages of this system of weights and meas- 
ures are: 
-(¥) Its simplicity. There are only five tables, and only 
one scale, except for surface and volume measures, where the 
squares and cubes of the one scale are quite logically used. 
(2) The definiteness of the units. It is said we have 130 
\ds.of bushels in the United States. A pound of one commod- 
may not be a pound of another. 
       
 
-P-A-G-E-412
406 NEW SCHOOL ARITHMETIC 
An English gallon is larger than an American gallon by about 
20% of the latter. In the place of much confusion such as this, 
the metric system offers absolute definiteness of units and of 
terms, : 
(3) Its close similarity to our decimal system. After some 
practice in the metric system, much of the work will become 
automatic, and much of it will become simply a matter of mov- 
ing decimal points, all of which correlates with our decimal 
system. 
The ‘Metric System was named from its fundamental unit, 
the Meter. All units of weights and measures are derived 
from the meter. 
The standard unit of length, surface, or volume is the meter 
in one, two, or three dimensions. 
The standard unit of capacity is the liter (lee-ter), a cubical 
vessel 71, of a meter on the edge. 
The standard unit of weight is the gram, the weight of a cube 
of water +4, of a meter on the edge. 
Latin and Greek prefixes are used to indicate sub-divisions 
and multiples of the standard units. 
The Latin prefixes denote sub-divisions. Thus, deci-meter, 
deci-liter, or deci-gram means +47 of a meter, liter,or gram; 
centi-meter, centi-liter, or centi-gram means 7} of a meter, 
liter, or gram; milli-meter, milli-liter, or milli-gram means qalgq 
of a meter, liter, or gram. 
The Greek prefixes denote multiples. Thus, Deka-meter, 
Deka-liter, or Deka-gram means 10 meters, liters, or grams; 
Hekto-meter, Hekto-liter, or Hekto-gram means 100 meters, 
liters, or grams; 
Kilo-meter, Kilo-liter, or Kilo-gram means 1000 meters, 
liters, or grams,

use are in italics.

CUBE AND CUBE ROOTS 415 
248. CUBES AND CUBE ROOTS 
Note: This topic is included principally for reference and may be omitted 
if deemed advisable. 
If a number is used three times as a factor, the product is 
called a cube. Thus, in 3X3X3=27, 27 is called a cube. A 
- cube always has three equal factors. One of the three equal 
factors of a number is called the cube root of that number. 
Instead of writing 3X38, we may write 3°; it is read, 
the cube of 3, or the third power of 3. 
When we wish to ask for one of the three equal factors, or 
cube root, of 27, we write it thus, ~/27; it is read, the cube root 
of 27. 
Find the roots indicated, and check by cubing.

FOREWORD 
In.accordance with a demand from many sources, we 
are offering our second “Childland” book for home and 
kindergarten use. Qur. purpose.is to give to the children 
the highest and best ideas of things connected with their 
every day experience. - 
This book will still.emphasize the sentence song, in- 
cidental music and many of the newer features of the first 
book, but will carry still further the scope of subject mat- 
ter relative to child nature. 
In addition to the group of songs of the seasons, love 
and loyalty, songs. of welcome, good-bye, devotion and many 
others, new material will be found in the way of interpret- 
ative. music, songs on. community helpers and music for spon- 
taneous. expression. 
Thus in trying to idealize the real, we are hoping in 
some measure to help the children realize the ideal.

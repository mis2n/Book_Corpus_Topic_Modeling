   PREFACE. 
THE ultimate object of this book is to place the Art of 
Study asa tool or instrument in the hands of pupils and     
        
               
         
                       
          
        
     students in schools. But as this object can be reached 
only by way of the teachers, the book is primarily ad- 
dressed to them, and to students of the science and the 
art of teaching. It is, therefore, plainly necessary in the 
first place to demonstrate the relations that should exist 
between the pupil and the teacher in the school, and then 
to present practical methods by which the teacher may 
establish and maintain such relations, Only through 
these means can the grand end be reached. The book, 
it will be seen, proposes a partial readjustment of the re- 
lations existing between the pupil and the teacher. In 
other words, it proposes to effect a partial shifting of the 
center of gravity in the school, by making the pupil the 
center of the system and placing the teacher in his proper 
orbit. 
It would have been easy greatly to multiply the parallel 
readings accompanying the chapters, but my observation 
is that in such a case a small but well-chosen bibliography 
is better than a large one,

CHAPTER I. 
LEARNING AND TEACHING. 
ONE of the most valuable arts that a boy or a girl, 
a young man or a young woman, can learn is the art of 
meecre eotudy. It is also an art that is nowhere ad- 
the Artof equately taught. It receives little conscious 
Bes attention on the part of either teacher or pupil 
in the school, and outside the school it is almost wholly 
neglected. These facts furnish the reason for the prepa- 
ration and publication of this book, which deals with the 
leading features of this art. 
In entering upon the subject, the first thing that 
demands attention is, obviously, to bound and describe 
the territory that the book will cultivate. To 
eee do this will require two or three brief chapters. 
We must begin with learning, which is the 
primary activity of the school, and with teaching, which 
is so closely connected with learning as almost to form 
a part of it. 
The science and the art of teaching assume that there 
is a duality of existence,—the mind and its environment, 
or the mind and the world. Philosophers sometimes 
7
-P-A-G-E-8
  8 THE ART OF STUDY, 
deny that this duality exists in reality, and affirm that 
there is only one existence, of which mind 
and the world are only different phases. But 
this is a metaphysical, not a pedagogical, 
question. Pedagogy starts with the apparent duality of 
existence, and never stops to inquire whether it is real or 
not. The problem of learning, or mental growth, then, 
involves the following elements : 
1. The mind, which is self-active and capable of learn- 
eile ing or of growing by its own activity. 
Process of 2. Objects of knowledge or things capable 
Bee ee of being known. These are of various kinds, 
as natural objects, the facts of human society, and the 
facts of the mind itself. 
3. A connection between the mind and such an object, 
for there is no activity of the mind, and so no knowledge 
or mental growth, until the two are brought into due 
relation. Either the mind must go to the object of knowl- 
edge, or the object of knowledge must be brought to 
the mind. 
At this point I should state that many objects of 
knowledge can be viewed in two ways—immediately and 
mediately. In the first case, the mind and the object are 
brought into immediate contact; in the sphere of the 
senses the individual sees or hears or handles the object 
for himself, and is not dependent upon the eyes or ears or 
fingers of any other person. In the second case, the in- 
dividual knows the object through some report or repre- 
sentation of it made by another, that is, through another’s 
mediation. Thus, I have seen Detroit and Lake Erie and 
have a first-hand or immediate knowledge of them, but 
Constantinople and the Black Sea I have not seen, and 
so know them only mediately or at second-hand, that is, The Duality 
of Being.
-P-A-G-E-9

through language and pictures. In the case of first-hand 
knowlédge there are two terms in the series ; in First and 
Becond- the case of second-hand knowledge there are 
ae threeterms. This distinction of first and second- Knowledge. 
hand knowledge, while important in its own 
place, does not, however, touch the core of the learning 
process. No matter whether we know the object directly 
or indirectly, the object itself or the representation of it 
must come into real relation with the mind. Thus our 
earliest knowledge originates in points of contact between 
our mental faculties and natural objects lying right about 
us in the world. Later welearn other objects through lan- 
guage and other forms of representation. We cannot ex- 
plain the excitation or activity of the mind that is caused by 
bringing objects of knowledge into contact with it, any 
more than we can explain the excitation of the mouths of 
certain animals when particles of food come in their way ; 
but we are certain of the fact—the young mind puts out 
its tentacles, so to speak, and makes these objects of 
knowledge its own. 
The word “learn” is supposed to come from a root 
meaning to go or to go over, and it means to gain knowl- 
edge or information in regard to some subject ; 
to ascertain by inquiry, study, or investigation ; 
to fix in the mind; to acquire understanding 
or skill. Activity is involved in the very root idea. 
The root of the word “teach” means to show, and in 
the broadest sense it means to secure the desired relation 
between the mind and some appropriate educa- 
tion-material. It may be conceived of as leading 
the mind to knowledge, or as bringing knowl- 
edge to the mind. The teacher, accordingly, is merely a 
mediator between the knowing mind of the pupil, on the The Word 
“Yearn.”” 
The Word 
“Teach.”

one hand, and the matter that is to be known, on the 
otHer. He brings the two together and so assists the 
mind in the generation of knowledge. Hence the defini- 
tions: “To teach is to cause to learn;” “Teaching is 
causing another to know ;” “ Teaching involves the idea 
of knowledge obtained by an active mental process.” 
Learning and teaching, closely united as they are, are 
not inseparable, because a man may learn without a 
teacher in the school of self-cultivation. It 
may be said that in such a case the learner is 
self-taught, or is his own teacher, but such use 
of the words, while consonant with the nature of the teach- 
ing process, is rather outside of the strict line of usage. 
But while there may be learning without teaching, there 
can be no teaching without learning. Learning is not 
Relations merely the correlative idea of teaching, but is of Learning : : . = 
and Teach. One Of its constituent elements. Teaching in- 
ing. volves the idea of a pupil, and this pupil in a 
state of mental activity that is produced by the teaching. 
When the pupil’s mind ceases to respond to the substance 
presented, there is no teaching, no matter what the 
teacher may do. When learning ceases, teaching ceases. 
A teacher cannot teach a group of absolutely inert pupils 
any more than he can teach a group of stumps ora pile 
of bowlders. In fact, such children are not pupils at all. 
To appropriate the words of another writer, “ Teaching is 
that part of the two-fold learning-process by which knowl- 
edge which is yet outside of the learner’s mind, is directed 
toward that mind; and learning is that part of the same 
two-fold process by which the knowledge taught is made 
the learner’s own. Still, as before, however, there can be 
no teacher where there is not a learner; although, on the 
other hand, there may be a learner where there is no one 
else than himself to be his teacher.” The Two not 
Inseparable.

ing includes the idea of two persons, both of whom are 
teaching active, and not merely active, but active over 
Implies the same lesson. This end may be secured by 
Yearning. the teacher hearing a recitation and comment- 
ing on it; but this is not necessarily teaching, since 
the pupil may be merely exercising his memory, re- 
citing what he has memorized verbally without under- 
standing a word of it, and so is not taught anything because 
he does not learn anything. In such case he is not caused 
to know asingle fact or truth that he did not know before, 
either from the lesson itself or from the teacher’s hearing 
him recite; nor does he learn anything by his teacher’s 
wisest comments or explanations, no matter how valuable 
these may be in themselves, if he pays no attention to 
them or if he is unable to understand them. There must 
be mutual effort directed to the same end. The teacher 
must strive to cause the pupil to learn a particular 
fact or truth that he wants him to know; the learner 
must seek to learn this particular fact or truth, and 
until the two are enlisted in this common work, the 
process of teaching has not begun. Tobe sure, teach- 
ing and learning are things of degrees; I am here speak- 
ing of the ideal. 
Strictly speaking there is no such thing as giving or\ 
imparting knowledge. Every one must make his own | 
knowledge, for man is a knowledge-maker by nature. 
All that one person can do for another, as a teacher for 
a pupil, is to help to do this work. The child is engaged 
in making knowledge from his earliest days."

search from our earliest years; and we probably attain greater success 
in infancy than in youth or in later life. e young child is completely

  12 THE ART OF STUDY. 
Learning governs teaching, as the history of the word 
suggests. Once, and this no farther back than Spenser 
and Shakespeare, learning applied to both efforts, that of 
the pupil as well as that of the teacher; a man could learn 
a lesson or he could learn a pupil. 
The function or office of the pupil and the function or 
office of the teacher are therefore perfectly clear. The 
pupil is to learn, the teacher is to teach or help 
See him learn ; both are active about the same thing, 
but active in different ways. More definitely, 
the function or office of the teacher is to mediate be- 
tween the pupil’s mind and the things that the pupil must 
learn or know. The question whether the teacher shall 
lead the pupil to these things or bring the things to the 
pupil, is much like the question of bringing the horse and 
the water together. The teacher's success is measured by 
the pupil’s success.- We shall not here enter into the ele- 
ments that are involved in successful mediation between 
mind and knowledge, that is, in teaching, further than to 
say that the teacher must select matter which is suitable 
for the pupil at his stage of advancement, and so com- 
bine, arrange, and present this matter that the pupil can 
understand and learn.

possess the power of putting that and that together and finding things out 
for itself. By applying this power, however, the child succeeds in bringing 
a large measure of order out of the chaos of sensations which it experi- 
ences. The method that it uses is the scientific or knowledge-making 
method.” Prof. A. MacMechan

  CHAPTER II. 
STUDY AND ITS RELATIONS TO LEARNING AND 
TEACHING, 
LEARNING is the activity of the pupil, teaching the ac- 
tivity of the instructor; and in the good school the two 
activities are found in constant relation. The pupil is 
striving to learn; the instructor to teach. We are now 
to define study and demonstrate its relation to teaching 
and learning. 
Our English words “ study,” “ student,” and “ studious ” 
all go back to the Latin verb studere, which means, first, 
“gtuay,» to be eager, zealous, or diligent about somebody 
“Student,” or something —to be friendly, attached, or “Studious.” . favorable to a person, or to favor him; and 
secondly, to apply one’s self with zeal and interest to the 
acquisition of knowledge or learning, or to study. Both 
definitions denote an activestate of mind; that is, the 
element of zeal or interest found in the original word runs 
through all its changes. In the second sense, therefore, 
a student would be one who pursues some subject with 
interest; he would study when he devotes himself zeal- 
ously to mastering some subject, while a study would be 
a subject that he could pursue with zeal. The second 
and later meaning of the word seems remote from the 14
-P-A-G-E-15
    STUDY, LEARNING, AND TEACHING. 15 
first one, but it is not difficult to explain how it origin- 
ated.! 
We shall have no further use for the original meaning 
of studere, since our subject lies wholly in the line of the 
later meaning or definition of the word. But 
ee aae even here we must narrow the field ; for study, 
in the proper sense of the term, is by no means 
co-extensive with the pursuit or the zealous pursuit of 
knowledge. The tendency of usage is to confine the word 
within much narrower limits. Dr. Alexander Bain, for 
example, finds the idea of study closely associated with 
that of learning from books. To quote a few sen- 
tences from this writer: 
“We may stretch the word, without culpable license, to comprise 
the observation of facts of all kinds, but it more naturally suggests 
the resort to book-lore for the knowledge that we are in 
quest of. There is considerable propriety in restricting 
it to this meaning ; or, at all events, in treating the art of 
becoming wise through reading as different from the arts of observing 
facts at first hand. In short, study should not be made co-extensive Dr. Bain 
on Study. 
1The question to be answered is how studere, which meant originally 
merely to be zealous about something, or to be diligent in general, came to 
be limited to diligence about knowledge or learning, Why was not the 
word limited to plowing, tailoring, or baking bread? Obviously, if a man 
is really eager or zealous about somebody or something, he will naturally 
give him or it serious attention ; that is, he will inquire and try to find out 
how he can favor the man or secure the thing; and such inquiry is just what 
constitutes study in the secondary sense of the word. This gives the pro- 
cess or method prominence, and it was easy when this point had been 
reached, if not indeed necessary, to limit stwdere in the abstract, or to study 
as we are accustomed to use the word. Thus it came about that studere 
came to mean to pursue knowledge zealously, and stwdium, the correlative 
noun, came to mean a subject, a branch of knowledge, orastudy. Studium 
also meant a place where study is done, or a school. Thus, the institutions 
that we now call universities were originally called studia universalia, or 
public schools.  
-P-A-G-E-16
    i6 THE ART OF STUDY. 
with knowledge-getting, but with book-learning. In thus narrowing 
the field, we have the obvious advantage of cultivating it more care- 
fully, and the unobvious, but very real advantage of dealing with one 
homogeneous subject.” 
The last remark refers solely to Dr. Bain’s own treat- 
ment of the subject, but it is just as applicable to my own. 
studyana He says again: “ The mental exercise that we 
the Use of now call ‘study ’ began when books began, when Books. : 
knowledge was reduced to language and laid 
out systematically in verbal compositions.” ? 
So far the history of the word supports Dr. Bain’s view. 
Unmistakably the tendency has been to confine the 
Study not Word “study” to the use of books. When we 
Limitedto deal with real things, as natural objects, we 
zon commonly employ some other word or words. 
One may, to be sure, study a daisy, a crab, or a piece of 
coral, but he is more apt to say he examines or investi- 
gates it. When Dr. Bain goes further, however, as he 
does, and says that study “relates more to self-education 
than to instruction under masters;” that ‘“ it supposes 
the voluntary choice of the individual rather than the 
constraint of an outward discipline,” and that “the time 
for its application is when the pupil is emancipated 
from the prescription and control of the scholastic 
curriculum,” we cannot yield our assent. This view ex- 
cludes teachers and the school from the field of study 
properly so-called, and confines the word to self-cultiva- 
tion, which usage, at least in this country, would not 
sanction, however it may be in England. With us, cer- 
tainly, usage does not tend even to the partial exclusion of 
schools and teachers from this field. On the other hand, 
the word at once suggests those instruments of education.

Still it is an important fact that study is not limited to 
schools. Men can study and do study without schools 
Stiayncte= Ck teachers ; to suppose that they do not is to 
Limitedto commit a blunder even greater than to say that 
Schools. bupils do not study inschools. Unfortunately, 
many youths, on taking leave of school, leave study and 
studies behind them. They forget that when what Rosen- 
kranz calls “the absolute limit of education”? is reached, 
the original inequality between the pupil and the teacher 
is canceled, and that the pupil should now enter into 
the field of self-culture. The two persons may con- 
tinue to be friends, but they are no longer teacher and 
pupil. The relation that these words express is a beau- 
tiful one in its own proper time, but, protracted beyond 
that time, it is offensive. It argues patronage upon the 
one part and dependence upon the other. The French 
philosopher Condillac, addressing a pupil who had reached 
this stage of progress, said: “ Henceforth, Sir, it remains 
for you alone to instruct yourself. Perhaps you imagine 
you have finished; but it is I who have finished. You 
are to beginanew"? This is the point of view from which 
it is sometimes said that the business of the teacher is to 
make himself useless, which he does by putting the pupil 
upon his feet and teaching him to walk alone, 
What has been said suggests the relation to each other 
of reading and study. As an exercise of mind, they do 
not differ save in degree; both arts look to 
Reading re . . 
and study obtaining thought or meaning from the printed 
Discrimi- page, But study is more than reading: it nated, + : . 
may be called intensive reading. The student 
goes over the matter more attentively than the reader;

he recalls it more fully, possesses himself of it more 
thoroughly. There is a difference, too, in the subject- 
matter of reading and study. We do not commonly ap- 
ply the term “ reading” to text-books and other works of 
a similar character prepared expressly for school use, but 
to books or other reading matter of a more general char- 
acter containing literary elements. Thus, the pupil studies 
his grammar and arithmetic, reads or studies his “ Lady of 
the Lake ” or “Hamlet,” but only reads the daily newspaper 
(unless it be the scores of the ball games) and the fugitive 
essay. Still more, reading embraces a wider range of 
mental interests than study. We read for amusement or 
diversion as well as for serious instruction, but that idea 
is rarely associated with studies, or at least with studies 
carried on in the school. Thus there appears in the 
modern word “study” that element of zeal or thorough- 
ness which characterizes the ancient word studere. 
The remark should be added that in England study is 
not used in our peculiar school sense; “read” is rather 
mhekng- the word that is employed where we say 
lish Sense ‘‘study.’”’ Thus, at the universities, the student 
of “Read.” teads” chemistry and calculus, Demosthenes 
and Tacitus, as well as Adam Smith and David Hume, 
while the hard student is the “hard reader.” Again, we 
have spoken of knowledge or instruction as though it 
constituted the end both of study and of serious reading, 
nay more, the end of learning itself. This is a contro- 
verted question as well as an important one, but it will 
not be dealt with in this place beyond the promise to 
consider it in a future chapter. 
_ In view of the preceding discussion the answer to the 
question, What is the relation of study to learning 
and teaching? is obvious enough. Study is the use of 
 
-P-A-G-E-19
  STUDY, LEARNING, AND TEACHING. 19 
books for the serious purpose of gaining knowledge; 
it looks to the mastery of a subject, or of some Study and = ‘ 
Learning. portion of a subject, by means of what has 
been written about it. More narrowly, pupils 
and students commonly associate study with text-books, 
but the association is not a necessary one. Study is a 
mode of learning, but not the only mode, for we can 
learn by observation, by listening to conversation, or by 
the simple reading of an article in the newspaper. Suc- 
cessful study of a subject is the same thing as learning it ; 
if the student succeeds with a lesson, he knows it, not, 
perhaps, as fully as the author, or as the teacher, but he 
knows it according to his own measure. Thus the word 
tends to exclude oral instruction and the direct investiga- 
tion of facts; that is, lectures or other oral lessons and 
the work of the laboratory. At the same time, the ex- 
clusion of these exercises is more formal than real, be- 
cause intellectual applications never wholly lose their iden- 
tity. Still, we shall best advance our immediate object 
by keeping books, and particularly text-books, constantly 
in mind; for while the investigation of things and the 
study of books have much in common, they are, never- 
theless, distinct arts. The library is not a laboratory or 
the laboratory a library, except in a figure of speech. 
And, still further, notwithstanding the great progress 
made in recent years by real study, that is by the direct 
study of objects, as in nature lessons, the book still gives, 
and will continue to give, the norm to the school.

CHAPTER III. 
THE ART OF STUDY DEFINED, 
WE have now defined learning, teaching, and study, 
and demonstrated their relations. The pupil learns when 
he acquires knowledge, and the teacher teaches when he 
assists the pupil to learn, Again, the pupil studies when 
he seeks to meet his teacher fairly and squarely on the 
lesson that has been assigned him by preparing that lesson. 
But what is the art of study? 
The term “art” is used in two senses. First, it means 
skill or practical ability actually shown in the pursuit of 
Two Senses Some calling or activity. Secondly, it means 
of Art: The the activity in which such skill is shown con- Practical : and the sidered as a subject. Thus, when we speak of 
Reflective. the photographer’s art we may mean either the 
degree of skill or proficience that a particular photographer 
shows in making photographs, or the making of such 
pictures considered as a vocation to be followed or a 
. subject to be studied. The same may be said of paint- 
ing, oratory, architecture, teaching, or any other pur- 
suit to which the term “art” is properly applied. To be 
master of one’s art is to possess much ability in the prose- 
cution of some employment called an art. Furthermore, 
an art in the second sense has its own methods, rules, and 
history that may be made the subjects of investigation or 
study. Inthis sense the term “ reflective” may be applied 
20 
 
-P-A-G-E-21
THE ART OF STUDY DEFINED. 21 
to an art, the suggestion being that the cultivator of this art 
halts, so to speak, in his practice or activity in order to 
make it the subject of examination. Nor is this all : cer- 
tain arts have rules and methods in common, and so we 
apply the term to them collectively, calling them art in a 
general or abstract sense. ‘ 
The relations of art as practical skill and art as method 
or acode of rules is an interesting subject. Experience 
Relations COunts for much in such matters, but the intel- 
a and ligent practice of any art presupposes a certain 
i amount of study of, or of acquaintance with, its 
method and rules. The practitioner in such case must be 
familiar with the leading features of his art. He may not 
have acquired his knowledge in large degree from books 
or lectures, but, if not, he must have investigated the sub- 
ject directly for himself. On the other hand, it is equally 
clear that no mere investigation of an art, no amount of 
knowledge concerning it, will, of itself, make a skillful 
practitioner or artist. Knowledge, while invaluable in 
itself, can never be made to take the place of that practice 
which makes perfect. The student, if he would possess 
skill, must try his own ’prentice hand until it becomes a 
practiced hand. There are many students of painting, 
sculpture, and other arts, who are not looking forward to 
the practice of these arts at all, but who pursue them be- 
cause they think the knowledge thus acquired is useful, 
or because they value the culture that they afford. 
The value of practice or experience in what are some- 
times called “practical matters” is well understood; so 
well, indeed, that the “ theory,” as it is often 
mistakenly called, is greatly undervalued in. 
comparison with practice; but in other fields 
theory is sometimes overrated. In moral training, for Practice and 
Theory.

example, it is sometimes assumed that the great thing is 
the acquirement of moral ideas, precepts, and rules, or 
moral instruction, thus ignoring or undervaluing moral 
habits, which canbe built up only through activity or 
practice. 
What has been said of the arts in general is true of the 
art of study in particular. The phrase means, first, per- 
whe Artof SONal skill, or practical ability, in carrying on 
Study studies, and, secondly, study as a subject of 
psinet investigation, consisting of its own peculiar 
method and rules. The student illustrates the first mean- 
ing of the art of study when he studies according to an 
intelligent plan some subject, such as history or literature ; 
and the second, when he seeks by study to find out 
the method and rules of the art, whether by his own im- 
mediate effort or by attending to the instruction of a 
teacher or an author. In this second sense study is a 
reflective art. 
What has now been called art in the second or reflective 
sense, is sometimes called theory or science. This isa

swers the questions what ? and why? the other the ques- 
tion how? 
To the preceding discussion of study as an art, two or 
three observations should be added. 
1. It is not necessary that a student, to be successful in 
study, should study his art in a formal or reflective way. ; 
Few good students, even those as far advanced 
praca ae as the college, have done so. These students 
have acquired their skill in study by the prac- 
tice of study. It is, to be sure, a fair question whether

students, or at least advanced students, might not give 
more formal attention to their art with advantage to them- 
selves; but we shall not enter upon a discussion of the 
question in this place. 
2. The student may study his art laboriously and never 
become a good student; that is, never learn to practice 
his art successfully. Here, as elsewhere, one 
may acquire knowledge of method, rule, and 
precept without acquiring the ability or skill to 
put it to use. In fact, at a certain stage of progress, such 
knowledge is a positive disadvantage, as it impedes rather 
than accelerates practice. But the main fact is this—a 
pupil will learn to study by studying, and not otherwise, 
just as he will learn to swim by swimming, and not other- Formal Art

ligent, or it must be conducted according to a right 
method. Now some happy pupils may, without great 
loss of time, find out this method for themselves, but the 
majority of pupils will not be able to do so. <Ac- 
cordingly the teacher should give much attention to his 
pupils’ efforts to learn their lessons, looking after the 
habits that they are forming, and, as far as possible, assist- 
ing them to form good habits. For this there are two 
reasons: one is that he will secure far better immediate 
results, and the other that he will assist the pupils to ac- 
quire an art which will be useful through life. Such work 
requires much oversight; the teacher must discover the 
pupils’ incorrect way of doing things and show them the

correct way, and by hint, suggestion, and encouragement 
hasten them on their road. Nor must it be forgotten that 
the teacher may overdo as well as underdo ; the pupil, ina 
most important sense, must learn to study for himself, 
and all that the teacher can do is to help him. In partic- 
ular, where assistance takes the form of rule and precept, 
it must, to be effective, be indirect and incidental.

CHAPTER IV. 
NEGLECT OF THE ART OF STUDY. 
THIS book opens with the two statements that the art 
of study is one of the most valuable arts that a child or 
a youth can acquire, and that it is nowhere adequately 
taught. Some of the facts that justify the first statement 
have been given in the preceding chapters, and some of 
those that justify the second one will be given in this 
chapter. 
In the schools, the art of study is taught, for the 
most part, indirectly, wholly at random, and very im- 
Neglect of perfectly. No book or manual is put into the 
Art of Study pupil’s hands, and, if one were, he could not

does not know how to teach the art well, or even 
understand its importance. It is to be feared that often 
he would not be able to set a very good example 
of practice or skill in the art, if called upon to do so 
The books, articles, and lectures from which the teacher 
has gained his own instruction relating to teaching give 
little attention to study, at least under its own proper 
name and in a practical manner. Outside of the schools, 
things are in one respect better than they are inside of 
them. The literature of self-culture treats the art of 
self-culture ina much more helpful way than the liter- 
ature of teaching treats the arts of study and of learn- 
ing. Unfortunately, however, this literature is quite

  beyond most of the pupils in ‘the schools, and is not much 
read by the majority of teachers themselves. 
In consequence of the general neglect properly to teach 
the art of study in the schools, most pupils pick up such 
knowledge and skill as they actually possess. Asa result, 
a large majority of them never become proficient in the 
Pupitspea- 2tt, and while everybody can read, we find so- 
cient inthe ciety full of young people, and old people too, 
ae who have no power, or very little, to carry 
on the investigation of any subject by means of books. 
Miscellaneous reading for diversion, or even for the pur- 
pose of obtaining knowledge, is common enough, but it is 
not study. . 
Competent judges will unhesitatingly assent to the 
statements that have just been made. Moreover, they 
Waste of Will assent, with equal readiness, to the further 
Time in statement that multitudes of persons suffer 
ae greatly on account of their ignorance of this 
art. In the schools, particularly, time is wasted, energy 
thrown away, and opportunity lost because pupils cannot 
study, that is, cannot properly do their work. Let it not 
be supposed that these remarks apply to elementary 
schools only, to which the name pupil might seem to 
limit them; they apply also, but in less degree, to high 
schools and academies and even to colleges and universi- 
ties. | 
Notorious facts lend to these remarks all needed con- 
firmation. For example, one of the commonest com- 
whe Testi. Plaints made by teachers relative to their pu- 
mony of _pils is that they are not properly prepared 
epee Teo do their work. This complaint is heard 
from the bottom of the scale to the top, and be- 
comes louder as we ascend. It is loud in the upper grades
-P-A-G-E-27
    NEGLECT OF THE ART OF STUDY. oe 
of the elementary schools, louder in the high schools, and 
loudest in the colleges. It takes on two forms. One 
form is that pupils do not know what they ought to know; 
the other and more significant form is that these pupils 
do not know how to study, or cannot practically do their 
work. .The relation of these two answers to each other 
—or the relation of positive knowledge to mental power 
and skill in acquiring knowledge — is an important topic; 
but for the present purpose the one form of complaint is 
as serious as the other. It may, perhaps, be said that the 
complaints which teachers make of the lack of preparation 
in their pupils are exaggerated, and we can readily see that 
such may be the case; but it is impossible to dispose of 
them all in that way, or, indeed, in any way short of as- 
suming that there is a great deal of truth behind them. 
At this stage of the discussion there occurs the ques- 
tion, What is a reasonable rate of progress for the pu- 
pil to make in school? Or, to put the question What isa E 
Reasonable jn another form, What is a reasonable require- 
Degree of . js ‘ Progress in ment to impose on him at any given stage of 
Schools? his educational progress? On this point there 
is some diversity of both practice and opinion. It is well 
known that the French boy or the German boy at the age of 
eighteen or nineteen, trained in the schools of his country 
and looking forward to the university, is fully two years 
in advance of the American boy of the same age trained 
in our schools and having a similar destination. The su- 
periority of the foreign boy, however, must not be mis- 
understood ; it lies exclusively in the education 
Seiad that is furnished by the schools. In the broader 
aa sense in which the word is often used — the 
: training and knowledge that come from imme- 
diate contact with the world—the French boy or the Ger-  
-P-A-G-E-28
  28 THE ART OF STUDY. 
man boy is as much inferior to the American boy as he 
surpasses him in scholastic attainments and ability. More 
definitely, the American boy, when he leaves the high 
school, is much inferior to the German boy on leaving the 
gymnasium in two particulars; first, the knowledge that 
is directly obtained in the school, and second, mental 
power. He is, however, a little younger. What is the 
cause of this disparity ? 
For one thing, the German and French boys who 
finish the studies of the secondary schools are a more 
carefully selected class of boys, intellectually considered, 
than the boys who graduate from our high schools. A 
majority, if not nearly all of them, are in training for the 
university, while much the larger number of the graduates 
from our high schools pass at once into practical life. For 
this reason, these foreign boys, considered as scholars, are 
superior to our American boys who attend the high school. 
German Foranother thing, the tension of the higher in- 
and¥rench tellectual life is greater in France or Germany 
Schools. —_ than it is in the United States. Then, the French 
and German courses of study, especially in secondary 
schools, have been more carefully wrought out and are 
better adapted to their purposes than our courses of study. 
From the day that a German boy at the age of nine 
years enters the gymnasium, he probably has his eye fixed 
upon the university or the technical high school. This 
topic has attracted much attention the last few years at 
the hands of our specialists, who have been seeking at 
once to shorten and to enrich our school programmes. 
Again, it may be that the German boy or the French boy, 
ascompared with the American boy, purchases his scho- 
lastic superiority at the cost of practical knowledge and 
ability ; but it is plain that the American boy might make  
-P-A-G-E-29
NEGLECT OF THE ART OF STUDY. 29 
more rapid progress in school than he does without 
impairing his practical talents, and that there is urgent 
reason why he should do so, especially if he is looking 
forward to a liberal education and a professional career. 
Important as these considerations are, they do not fully - 
answer our question. When all has been said, the fact 
remains that much of the “marking time” in 
our schools is due to the relative incompetence 
of teachers, which again is due to the most 
patent causes. In(Germany, teaching is a serious calling, 
to be followed for life; in the United States, it is only 
too often the vestibule leading to a calling. Comparing 
more closely the teaching of our schools with that of 
the German schools, it is found to be inferior in two 
important particulars: the knowledge that it imparts, 
and the habits of mind that it generates. For the pres- 
ent purpose, the main fact is this —the American boy 
does not know how to study as well as the German boy, 
or is not an equal master of his art. Pupils in schools 
often “mark time” because they cannot march forward. 
The burden of this chapter is the neglect of the art of 
study in the schools, In the first instance, the fault 
eet us the fault of teachers. But why do teach-

Teachers. Cause they do not appreciate its value, and 
partly because they do not know how to give it the 
kind of attention that it requires. Moreover, this lack 
of appreciation and this lack of ability are closely bound 
up together. Practical reform, therefore, must begin 
with the better preparation of teachers, not so much, 
indeed, in general scholarship or in the studies that they 
teach, (which is an important topic by itself,) but in the 
art of study—what it is,and how it must be taught to German

CHAPTER V. 
IS KNOWLEDGE OR MENTAL DEVELOPMENT THE END 
OF TEACHING? 
THE teacher who has gone carefully through the fore- 
going chapters may think that he should now be brought 
to the consideration of his own relation, as a teacher, to 
the art of study. What is my work, my duty in the 
premises ? he will naturally ask. It is the main object of 
this book to answer this question; but the answer will 
be all the clearer and stronger if it is preceded by a brief 
discussion of the end or aim of education itself. 
M. Compayré notices two different tendencies in 
modern educational thought and practice. +These tenden- 
cies appear when’ we consider the question, 
Beatties: What is the end of education? Is it a change 
oe that the mind itself undergoes, or is it a 
store of facts and ideas that the mind ac- 
quires? Compayré states the question thus: “ There 
are those who wish above all to develop the intelligence; 
and there are others who are preoccupied with furnishing 
the mind with a stock of positive knowledge.” ! Some 
affect a subjective pedagogy, and others an objective 
pedagogy. He considers Descartes a leading exponent of 
the one school and Francis Bacon of the other. Which 
of these two tendencies is the true one? Both views are 
firmly rooted in language and in mental habit. The 
subjective pedagogy emphasizes power and capacity,

  32 THE ART OF STUDY. 
discipline and training, culture, development, and growth, 
while the objective pedagogy dwells on ideas, facts, 
knowledge, truths, science, and learning. It will not 
be difficult to maintain Compayré’s claim that they 
are both equally right so long as they refrain from 
exaggeration. 
First, mental discipline, power, culture,—call it what 
you will,—is generated by means of mental activity ; while 
pes activity, self-activity, is indeed the very char- 
Comes from acteristic of the mind. But the mind acts only 
Fey as it acts on something; it cannot act, so to 
speak, in a vacuum. Furthermore, the object 
that the mind acts upon is an object of knowledge, and 
the activity itself is knowing. Discipline and knowledge 
are acquired together. 
But secondly, knowledge cannot be passively acquired. 
Knowing is an active process. The very word “ study” 
Knowledge implies zeal and thoroughness, as we have 
and Mental seen, The mind in forming its earliest ideas Activity. i ‘ se is something very different from the sensitive 
plate in the camera that merely receives impressions. 
Knowledge, then, depends upon the very agent that pro- 
duces discipline and culture. 
So far the path is clear. What difference does it make, 
then, whether we regard education as developed mind or 
as positive knowledge? This isthe question that we are 
now to examine. 
It may be strange, but it is true, that mental develop- 
ment and positive attainments are not mutual measures, | 
ee If they were, the teacher’s problem would be 
Knowledge much simplified. Development may be in ex- 
ee cess of attainment, and attainment may be 
in excess of development. It is well known 
that men are not efficient in the work of their hands
-P-A-G-E-33
  
  IS KNOWLEDGE THE END OF TEACHING? 33 
in the ratio of their strength or effort. The strongest 
man is not necessarily the best chopper, runner, or 
boxer; he may waste his strength in misdirected and 
unskillful attempts to accomplish what he does not know 
how to do well. Again, men are not efficient in the 
mental sphere in the ratio of their natural powers or of 
their effo:ts; some men do not know how to use their 
minds. Onthe other hand, there are those who suc- 
ceed, some in physical and some in mental work, beyond 
their apparent strength. They make their blows tell, work 
to advantage, strike when the iron is hot, as we are all 
exhorted to do by the well-known prudential maxims. 
Here it is that directive intelligence and practical skill 
come into play. “So fight I,” said St. Paul, “ not as one 
that beateth the air.” The figure comes from the boxing 
contest. The Apostle strove, metaphorically, to land his 
blows on the body of his antagonist. It is a well- 
known fact that habit or training both saves and increases 
power. 
In the schoolroom misdirected and wasted effort is one 
of the commonest facts. It is one of the most serious of

Energyin heard. Who that has seen much of schools has Schools. , : : : not witnessed the “ painful inefficiency” and 
“laborious idleness” mentioned by Mr. Mill in his St. 
Andrews’ Address as characteristic of the schools of Eng- 
land? The sight is a pathetic one —that of the pupil or 
student who has plenty of native power, but who does not 
know how to use it to advantage. The blind giants that 
figure in storiesare no unfit types of many pupils found 
in schools —only the giants are generally restrained by 
their blindness from doing mischief, which is more than 
can always be said of the pupils.

said to the boys at Rugby: “ You come here, not to read, 
but to learn how to read,” that is, to study, for such is the 
English use of the word ; and Sir William Hamilton told 
his students at the University of Edinburgh that his aim 
would be to teach them, not philosophy, but to philoso- 
phize. But it is very plain that the boys at Rugby could 
not learn how to read, or study, as we should say, without 
reading or studying, or the students at Edinburgh learn to 
philosophize if they were kept ignorant of philosophy ; as 
these distinguished teachers knew perfectly well. The 
main question relates to emphasis, asso many educational 
questions do. The teacher should pay due heed to the 
way the pupil does his work, his mental habits, the develop- 
ment of his mind—see, in a word, that he acquires the art 
of study ; but he should also insist upon positive attain- 
ments in knowledge. Study is not “marking time,” but 
it is marching,—getting somewhere. Education is not a 
Barmecide feast, but a substantial repast. 
The teacher, let it be said again, must be careful how 
he places his emphasis. It was thought once that elemen-

was paid to the pupil’s positive attainments. The con- 
summate flower of this view of education was the dogma 
of formal discipline,—the theory that by pursuing cer- 
tain studies, as mathematics and classics, mental energy 
could be stored up to be drawn upon for any and all

purposes. There is now a strong recoil from this posi- 
tion ; knowledge, we are told,isthe end. This recoil was 
certainly needed, but it must not gotoo far. It will cer- 
tainly go too far, however, if men are led to deny the pre- 
paratory function of education and to lose sight of the 
development of the mind. 
It is probable that in the long run there is no antago- 
nism, but rather complete concord, between development 
erie: and knowledge, and that what is best for the 
mentand one is best for the other; but in the short run 
Knowledge. this is not always, or indeed generally true. 
There are times, for example, when development and 
attainment should not receive equal emphasis. Elemen- 
tary education is largely preparatory, looking to discipline, 
power, method, and skill; it islargely occupied with acquir- 
ing a command of certain arts, the perfect use of which 
will be found in the future. But this is not true, in the 
same sense, of university education, the great end of 
which is positive attainments or knowledge. Here the 
student is supposed to have mastered his arts, at least 
measurably. The intelligent teacher does not always look 
for the quickest returns, The amount of walking that a 
child does until he is two years old is no compensation, 
in itself, for the cost of his tuition inthe art. It would 
have been much easier for his parent or nurse to carry him 
over the short distances that he has covered; but the 
present sacrifice is future gain. And so it is with the 
elementary school. As I have said elsewhere : 
“To convey knowledge at first through reading, strictly speaking, 
is impossible. The fact is, that if all the time which is spent in 
Learning to teaching the pupil to read asa mere art were devoted 
Read. to enlarging his real knowledge or mental store by plying 
his faculties of observation with objects, and through conversation, he

would know more at the end of a year of school life than he now 
knows. To be sure, the art itself contains objects of real knowledge, 
though of little value abstractly considered, and also confers dis- 
cipline ; still, from the point of view of real knowledge, the time so 
spent is mainly wasted. But this waste we gladly incur, since this 
incomparable instrument of acquirement when once gained is a hun- 
dredfold compensation.” 1 
Objective pedagogy has its own attractions for 
teachers, pupils, and patrons of schools. Holding up 
Weakness knowledge as its end, it produces results of a 
of tne obiec- tangible character that can, to a great extent, 
agogy. be measured out in examinations. It is a very 
taking theory to the practical man, who rejoices in posi- 
tive knowledge or what he sometimes terms “ useful in- 
formation.” But it is attended by one peculiar danger: 
It tends to foster in the teacher the search for quick re- 
turns, and so stimulates the cramming system. Let a 
teacher become firmly possessed by the idea that the 
great end to be sought in teaching is increase of the 
pupil’s knowledge, and, unless he is also possessed of 
moderation and self-restraint, he will, if energetic, surely 
fall to cramming. 
On the other hand, subjective pedagogy has its at- 
tractions for certain minds. It is much affected by 
Weakness students of literature, ancient and modern, and 
Pee etn by cultivators of philosophical studies. These 
agogy. persons tend to find the goal of education in 
the perfection of the mind itself, not in the abundance or 
character of its attainments. The teacher who takes this 
view has his own besetting danger, which is that sound 
ideas and practical methods will evaporate in vague no- 
tions and inefficient teaching. Both the ignorance and 
1 Teaching the Language-Arts, N. Y. D, Appleton & Co, 1896, chap. xii. 
 
-P-A-G-E-37
IS KNOWLEDGE THE END OF TEACHING? 37 
the indolence of the teacher may be veiled, and the lack 
of substantial attainments on the part of the pupil be ex- 
cused, by the free use of such pleasant wordsas “ develop- 
ment,” “growth,” and “culture.” In the latter case the 
implication is that, although the pupil may not learn any- 
thing in particular, it is still well with his “mind.” To 
some extent this is now an evil in many schools; the 
pupils are believed to be “developed,” or at least to be 
“ developing,” no matter whether they know much or little, 
or whether what they know bears any relation to the 
end they have in view. 
The conclusion is that the teacher who looks directly to 
knowledge should also remember mental development

upon what the end is. Knowledge may safely be held 
before the pupil’s mind as a thing to be striven for; but, 
as a rule, little good will come, and much harm, from 
similarly holding out to him mental development. On 
this point Mr. Latham has some remarks which are so 
admirable that I shall venture to quote them:

takes it to show that you have nothing better to say in their favor, and 
that in reality they are of no good. You will do more with him, 
usually, by calling on him to work in pure faith as a matter of duty, 
telling him that at that time he cannot be made to see the good of 
these studies, but that he must work, taking it on trust that there is a 
good, and that you know what it is, and would not worry him with 
lessons for lessons’ sake. 
“Sometimes a persuasive teacher will lead a few boys in the upper 
classes in a school to fancy that they are interested in the training of 
their minds. The result too often is that they are made self-conscious 
prigs. They will tell you that they are studying this and that to give 
them method, or accuracy, or a command of language. They are fre- 
quently discovering peculiarities in their own mental structure; they 
will consult their tutor on the way to remedy certain defects of which 
they are conscious—which defects, by the way, are mostly of that kind 
which they in their hearts believe to be only excellencies transformed 
—and so they get positively injured, either by the habit of retrospec- 
iion in reality, or by the affectation of watching the action of their 
minds, and by bcundless talking about themselves.” 2 
The point of view taken in this chapter is that of the 
teacher inthe schoolroom. It is assumed that the end of 
education—as preparation for complete living—has been 
chosen and the school set in order to gain that end. 
This done, the question presents itself to the teacher—

  CHAPTER VI. 
THE FIRST STAGE OF INSTRUCTION IN THE ART OF 
STUDY. 
Ir was stated in the first chapter that the sole func- 
tion of the teacher, as an instructor, is to mediate be- 
ee dds tween the pupil’s mind, on the one part, and 
the Teacher the things that the pupil should learn or know, 
poor iat on the other. He should either bring the 
things that are to be known to the pupil, 
or lead the pupil to the things,—whichever way one may 
prefer to put it. How shall the teacher perform this 
function ? 
To answer this question we must recall the distinction 
made in the same chapter between the knowledge that re-

from a picture. But there is adifference in the apprehen- 
sion of things; some I may know in both ways, some 
only in one way. Some external objects I know both 
directly and indirectly—through my own faculties, and 
through representation ; but many more I can know 
only indirectly, since it is impossible for me to go to them 
39 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
  4o THE ART OF STUDY. 
or for them to be brought to me. Perhaps the object 
does not now exist, perhaps it is too distant for contact 
between it and me to be established, and perhaps it eludes 
me owing to my lack of expertness or skill in observation. 
Icannot directly know Nero’s palace at Rome, because 
it perished long ago, or the Philippine Islands, because 
they are thousands of miles distant, or microbes, because 
Iam not a microscopist. Again, internal objects, or the 
states of my own mind, I know only directly through 
consciousness; no one can report these objects to me 
faithfully, because no one but myself really knows them. 
There are, then, two great spheres of knowledge, the 
first-hand and the second-hand. Next, it must be observed 
meaching that education must move in both these 
Movesin spheres. The child first learns things directly, 
Both Spheres. 4d so knows them for himself; he is an origi- 
nal investigator and discoverer, using his own eyes, ears, 
and other senses in acquiring sensations, and his own 
faculties of mind in working these sensations up into 
ideas. Such knowledge is the first that the child ac. 
quires. What is more, in the earlier period of a child’s life, 
all that a second person can do to promote the knowing 
process is through the selection and presentation to him 
of appropriate’ objects; explanations he will not under- 
stand. But soon the child begins to learn at second-hand ; 
that is, he begins to know things through the accounts 
that others give him, instead of the things themselves, 
These accounts he understands through his stock of facts 
and ideas gained at first-hand. Second-hand knowledge 
is, therefore, supplementary to first-hand knowledge. 
What the individual can learn directly, for himself, is not 
enough to answer his purposes. Besides, he can learn 
many things much better, and more quickly, indirectly
-P-A-G-E-41
   THE FIRST STAGE IN THE ART OF STUDY. 41 
from others than he can learn them directly for himself ; 
while through oral communication with others, through 
the newspaper, the magazine, the book, and the library, 
he can reénforce his meager but invaluable store of facts, 
ideas, and thoughts by drawing upon the vast store that 
the race has been some thousands of years in accumulat- 
ing. In this way the feeble individual arms himself with 
the might of the human race. 
Let us next inquire how all this affects the work of the 
teacher. The child comes to school with his own little 
meen ee stock of facts, ideas, and thoughts of men and 
comingto things, some of them received at first-hand, 
School. some at second-hand, and some partly in one 
way and partly in the other. His mind is growing in 
both of the two spheres of knowledge, but more rapidly 
in the first than in the second sphere. He has as yet no 
other means of communicating with the store of collect- 
ive knowledge or thought than oral language. This, it 
may be observed, is a fortunate circumstance, since the 
tendency and effect of it is to keep first-hand knowledge 
well in advance. Still, the normal child is eager to learn 
new things indirectly; he does not soon tire of pic- 
tures and stories of thirigs and scenes that, touch in any 
way his own experience. 3 
The simple facts. that have just been told determine 
the work of the teacher as a mediator between the child 
Bee and objects of knowledge. He is to promote, 1e e . 
ers Double as best he can, the child’s mental advance- 
Duty. ment in both spheres of knowledge. More 
definitely, he will, through object lessons and nature 
teaching, assist the child to increase his stock of 
object knowledge, or to come into closer relation with 
the external world; while through tales, stories, and ex-

planations he will help the child to increase his second- 
hand knowledge and so bring him into fulier communion 
with the experience of the race. 
The first of these duties devolving upon the teacher 
lies outside of our proper field, and so will not occupy 
whe First Our attention save incidentally ; but it should

Study. warning has been sounded. The teacher must 
not suppose that he has nothing to do in the direction 
of teaching real knowledge. Entrance into the school 
should not mark a sudden change or break in the child’s 
mental life. Mental growthinthe second sphere depends 
intimately upon the growth in the first sphere. Accord- 
ingly, the pupil’s mental life should not be allowed to 
starve and dry up at the roots. 
The teacher’s main duty embraces two processes. The 
first of these is the oral communication of knowledge, 
which assumes the well known form of explanations of 
objects that are present, and of reports of objects that 
areabsent. Oral instruction is the easiest, quickest, and 
cheapest way in which much knowledge can be acquired, 
and the best way also, provided it is properly correlated 
with real things, on the one hand, and books on the other. 
If we consider the present only, we must certainly agree 
with Dr. Bain’s statement of the case. 
“Undoubtedly, the best of all ways of learning anything is to have 
a competent master to dole out a fixed quantity every day, just suffi- 
PenainGn cient to be taken in, and no more; the pupils to apply 
Oral Teach- themselves to the matter so imparted, and to do nothing 
ing. else. The singleness of aim is favorable to the greatest 
rapidity of acquirement ; and any defects are to be left out of account, 
until one thread of ideas is firmly set in the mind. Not unfrequently, 
however, and not improperly, the teacher has a text-book in aid of his 
oral instructions. To make this a help, and not a hindrance, demands  
-P-A-G-E-43
THE FIRST STAGE IN THE ART OF STUDY. 43 
the greatest delicacy; the sole consideration being that the pupil must 
be kept 2 one single line of thought, and never be required to com- 
prehend on the same point conflicting or varying statements.” + 
The other teaching process is to put books into the 
pupil’s hand and show him how to use them. They 
are the great repositories of the knowledge that 
‘The Teacher > 
toTeach the the race has accumulated. The meaning of 
ee this is that the teacher must teach the pupil to 
: read and write. Time was when to teach these 
elementary arts was thought to be almost the sole func- 
tion of the primary school; nor is it an exaggeration to 
call it now the most important function of that, school. 
For the child, reading is the primary school art. 
Strictly speaking, the pupil’s first lessons in reading are 
also his first lessons in study, as we are using that word. 
whe First Reading, however, is of two kinds, or the word

mechanical apparatus of letters, words, sentences, and punc- 
tuation by which thought is conveyed ; or it is to put into 
the pupil’s hand the key that unlocks the printed page, the 
book, and the library. But in the second and higher sense, 
teaching a pupil to read consists in showing him how to 
use this key in unlocking these mysteries. The distinc- 
tion is the same as that between any tool and the prac- 
tical use of the tool. Fundamentally, then, the art of 
study is the same thing as the art of reading, as was ex- 
plained in an earlier chapter. The teacher's practical 
question is how to teach reading in that intensive sense 
which constitutes study. We are not here concerned with 
the technical aspects of the subject.

  44 THE ART OF STUDY. 
It will be remembered that the term “art” is used in 
two senses, — skill in some kind of activity or practice, 
and the method to which skill conforms. Hence 
ae the art of study is either skill in study or it is 
volves Skill the method of study. Complete mastery of 
and Method. +e art involves both elements, and so would 
complete instruction in the art. Ifa good teacher were to 
direct a boy through his whole course of study from the 
first primary grade to graduation from college, he would 
teach him both elements. But in what order would he 
teach them? The answer to this question, while plain 
enough, is still sometimes mistaken. 
How did allthe simple arts originate? Obviously, in 
practice or doing, and not in rules or formal method. 
Historically, the race bleached cloths, tanned 
peers of hides, constructed shelters for themselves and 
ornamented these shelters, and fought battles 
before they thought of the rules relating to these arts, 
And so with the individual man; he walks, talks, and 
sings before he knows anything about the appropriate 
rules or formal methods. The child cannot at first un- 
derstand or reduce to practice even the simplest rules. He 
learns to talk by talking, to walk by walking, to sing by 
singing; that is, using the faculties with which Nature 
has endowed him, he imitates the similar actions that he 
sees his seniors perform. 
Consider how it is with the technique of reading. 
There is an extensive body of rules relating to this art,— 
mne'tech. ‘ules for the sounds of letters, for inflections

modulation. Now what does the teacher who teaches a 
child to read do with all this apparatus? Why, he simply

THE FIRST STAGE IN THE ART OF STUDY. 45 
turns his back upon it. He calls the child to a chart con- 
taining a few simple words and sentences, or to a black- 
board on which he writes the lessons as they are required. 
Or, he puts a primer into the child’s hand, and begins to 
exercise him in the simplest elements of the art. The 
teacher sets an example here and corrects a fault there; 
he gives a few simple directions, but no rules until the 
work is far advanced. Thus the child learns to read by 
reading. In course of time he may learn the formal 
method of reading or he may not; but it is very clear 
that he will learn to read well, if he ever learns at all, be- 
Rene aa fore he knows much about rules and method- 
Learns to ized procedure. Suppose this sensible practice 
mene were reversed —that the child were required to 
learn the rules before he learned to read— 
what would happen? This, unmistakably, that his prog- 
ress would be greatly retarded, if, indeed, he ever learned 
to read at all. Reading is a consummate art, which the 
child learns by practice under intelligent direction. And 
so it is with the art of study. The child learns how to 
learn by actually learning, and how to study by actually 
studying ; he cannot acquire the art in any other way. In 
this first stage, instruction in the art must run in the line 
of the pupil’s work, —it must blend with the daily exer- 
cises of the school. 
What, then, is the teacher’s function at this stage of 
the child’s education? Obviously, to help the pupil to

him. He should guide him, not by directing . 
him to go forward, but by leading him forward. He 
should not fall to lecturing him on the art, but see that 
he actually practices it,and practices it in the proper way. 
The teacher may, indeed, drop a hint here and offer a sug- 
gestion there that istaken from formal method, but noth- 
ing more at this stage of progress. The reflective or formal 
art of study belongs to a later stage of development. 
Talking about the art of study is no more teaching a 
young pupil the art than ike about gymnastics will 
make an athlete. Habit comes from practice. There are 
indeed rules that apply to studies at this stage of knowl- 
edge; these the teacher should understand, and also see 
that the pupil observes them as far as possible, but he 
should, for the most part, keep them to himself. He 
should teach according to method, but not teach method.

  CHAPTER VII. 
THE CHILD’S FIRST CONTACT WITH THE BOOK. 
THE child that we have in view comes to school at the 
age of five or six years not knowing how to read. The 
weaching book is more of a mystery to him than an As- 
the Pupilto syrian inscription would be to the common 
moe laborer. He cannot study the book because 
he cannot read it, and he cannot learn to read it without 
a teacher. 
The teacher understands his task and sets about it; he 
works with the pupil. There is, in the ordinary school- 
room sense, nostudy and no recitation, but a single homo- 
geneous exercise that is compounded of both. The 
pupil is trying to learn the mechanism of the printed 
page, or the technical art of reading, and also to grasp the 
meaning that this mechanism conveys. The teacher, on 
his side, does the best he can to assist the pupil in both 
endeavors. No matter what the method may be,—al- 
phabetic, werd, or phonic,—such is the process in all 
schools, ; 
We have here exemplified the art of teaching in its 
simplest and purest form ; two minds are active over the 
The Pure Same matter, one striving to learn, the other to 
Ree teach. It is the type of all teaching before the 
invention of writing and the composition of 
books. Then instruction was direct and personal, ad- 
dressed either to a single mind or toa group of minds. 
Ge
-P-A-G-E-48
  48 THE ART OF STUDY. 
But the introduction of books brought changes. For. 
one thing, it tended to put the sources of knowledge 
and the teacher farther away from the pupil than they had 
been ; and, for another thing, it ushered in the art of study. 
Perhaps the statement should be limited by the qualifica- 
tion that it was the original or primary sources of knowl- 
edge that were now removed farther away from the pupil. 
There had been learning from the time when minds and 
the world were first brought into contact, but there had 
been no study, in our sensé of the term, previous to the 
invention of reading and writing. Dr. Bain is quite right 
when he says that our art “began when books began ; 
when knowledge was reduced . language, and laid out 
in verbal compositions.” The farther removal of the 
sources of knowledge and the teacher from the learner, were 
disadvantages that have never been wholly removed to 
this day ; but, fortunately, they have been far more than 
compensated for by the great blessings that books have 
conferred upon men. 
In this early stage of instruction the teacher understands 
his business, and, we will say, performs it ina satisfactory 
whe Pas- Manner. He teaches the pupil to read. The 
sagefrom trouble begins, however, when the pupil has 
eatian: learned to read his reading lesson, or his 
reader, and when other books, as an elementary 
geography and arithmetic, are put into his hands. In one 
sense the trouble antedates this stage in the pupil’s prog- 
ress. That is, the simple homogeneous work of the 
primary class, which ran along one line, early began to 
divide into two lines of work, one of them called study 
and the other teaching, or the lesson and the recitation. 
The division was not sharp at first, but it became sharper 
as time went on; the pupil and the teacher began to sep-

THE CHILD'S CONTACT WITH THE BOOK. 49 
. arate slightly at the very moment when the teacher gave 
the pupil work to be done at his desk, or, as the phrase is, 
set him a lesson to prepare for recitation. Now this dif- 
ferentiation is quite in the nature of things and is alto- 
gether right and necessary. The pupil must learn to work 
by himself independently ; this is the very core of the art 
of study; and he can learn to do such work only by 
doing it. He will never become an independent student 
without abundant practice of this kind. In fact, the pupil 
and the teacher must move on lines more or less divergent 
from an early period in the child’s school life, until 
they finally separate, but they ought not to diverge too 
rapidly or separate too quickly. Let us see how it was 
in the old-fashioned district school that is sometimes 
praised with little discrimination. 
In that school, in the first place, there were no proper 
books for teaching reading, no graded series of readers,

the O14 The pupil learned his letters, his a-b,—abs, his

and was then hurried, perhaps to the New Testament, 
and next tothe English Reader. Up tothe point when the 
pupil could read his short sentences in the speller, the 
teacher worked with him, but now the work suddenly 
divided into the lesson and the recitation. The pupil could 
stumble along his own way ; a lesson was assigned him to 
prepare, and, this done, he was called up, either in class, 
or by himself, to read. In the recitation he received more 
or less help on the mechanical side; he was drilled in the 
sounds of letters, corrected in pronunciation and accent, 
and practiced in articulation and inflection; he heard his 
classmates, schoolfellows, and the teacher read, and 
learned something from them through imitation. But the 
Art of Study.—4. 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
50 ° THE ART OF STUDY. 
thought side, or the reading proper, was greatly neglected. 
Sometimes there were formal exercises in defining words, 
but the definitions were commonly synonyms or strings 
of words that took little hold of reality. 
In arithmetic the teacher gave the pupil some instruc- 
tion in the fundamental rules, and then practically aban- 
doned him to his fate. Henceforth the pupil, Arithmetic : : in the ola ON coming to a new subject, first looked up 
enool, “the rule;” then he began, in the most me- 
chanical fashion, to “do his sums,” as working the ex- 
amples and problems was called. If he could get on 
alone, well; but if not, he called upon the teacher, who 
explained the rule or did the sum, generally in a purely 
mechanical manner. “To cipher through the book” 
was a notable achievement and considered quite equal to 
mastering arithmetic. 
So the pupil brought his geography to the school- 
house, and, perhaps without any conference with the 
Geography teacher, fell to memorizing. the first lesson. inthe Old EE, E Meno: After the first recitation the teacher assigned 
the lessons, always in the order in which they stood 
in the book. The recitations consisted of dreary lists of 
questions and equally dreary answers. The pupil gave, 
from memory, definitions of the leading terms, located 
countries and bodies of water, described rivers and moun 
tains, named capitals and other important cities, bounded 
states, and produced a variety of statistical information 
relating to distances, areas, latitude and longitude, popu- 
lation, etc. The total result, if the pupil had a good 
memory, was a collection of facts more or less valuable in 
themselves, but wholly undigested and furnishing in no 
sense a correct and lively picture of the earth or of any 
portion of the earth. If the pupil failed to find a lake or

‘ 
town on his map to-day, he was told “to hunt it up” to- 
morrow. Indeed, the study of geography consisted 
largely of “hunting up things” that were of no earthly 
consequence tothe pupil when they had been found. 
Again, the pupil brought to the schoolhouse his copy- 
book, his ink bottle, and his goose quills; the teacher set 
his copies and made his pens; and this was often prac- 
tically all the help that the pupil received. 
It was much the same way with the other studies. The 
best work was perhaps done in spelling, because spell- 
Resultsof ig was the most mechanical. There were 
the Regi: teachers and teachers in those days, as there 
cam are now, but intelligent survivors of that dis- 
‘ mal period will hardly deny that the foregoing account 
® of the old district school is typically correct. There was 
much study, provided only the student had ability and 
ambition, and could get enough incidental help, at home 
and in school, to set him on his feet ; but there was little 
teaching. On the whole, one is rather surprised that the 
pupils learned as muchas they did learn. It must be con- 
fessed, in fact, that some of them did exceptionally well. 
Those who had strong intellects and determined wills, 
being thrown upon their own resources, developed their re- 
served strength and became independent students. But it 
is pathetic, even at this distance of time, to recall the boys 
and girls who never learned how to study and never got 
beyond the merest rudiments of an education. Some of 
them never even learned to read with much intelligence, 
and as for arithmetic, which was the other leading study, 
they acquired little more than the elementary operations 
and were by no means proficient in them. The old dis- 
trict school was of great value, but in studying this chap- 
ter of educational history the student must not allow
-P-A-G-E-52
  52 THE ART OF STUDY. 
himself to be misled by the sentiment that has grown 
up around the “little red schoolhouse.” 
The old school illustrates, in an exaggerated degree, 
one trouble with the new school: the pupil and the 
peretisn teacher are not properly adjusted to each 
of Teacher other, and especially from the time the pupil 
and Pupil. is able to use his book. Pupil and teacher 
start out together on the same road, hand in hand. 
Soon their paths begin to divide, and the two companions 
to separate; and this process goes on until they part 
company. For the larger part of the time that 
they are together in the school they meet and touch 
hands, perhaps, only at the assignment and ‘the recita- 
tion of the lessons. This system may properly be set up 
as a distant goal, but it has no place in the early stages 
of education. What the pupil needs when books are put 
in his hands as sources of knowledge, is that the teacher 
shall go along with him and help him to use them, 
What he frequently receives is a set lesson in a book, 
which perhaps interests him but little, but which he must 
learn and then recite. He receives little or no help 
when he most needs it; the person who should help him 
to learn his lesson really hears him recite it, orso much of 
itas he learns himself. He asks for bread and is given 
a stone. 
Iam not unaware that important changes have been 
made in the schools since the “ good old times,” as they 
eibazes in ate affectionately called. Instruction is far 
the School. less abstract and far more concrete and real than 
it was fifty years ago. In good schools such subjects as 
primary geography and arithmetic are first presented in 
oral lessons, so that the pupil is not wholly ignorant of the 
subject when he first takes up the book. It is also true
-P-A-G-E-53
THE CHILD'S CONTACT WITH THE BOOK. 53 
that good teachers work with their pupils, showing them 
how to use their books. Nor am I forgetting that, as arule, 
the most skillful teaching to-day is found in the primary 
schools. But to ingraft book instruction on oral teach- 
ing is a delicate art, and no one can claim that the teachers 
in our schools have generally mastered it. Sometimes 
the transition is too abrupt, too little help being given; 
then, again, the help that is rendered is given in such 
a manner as to engender the continued dependence of the 
pupil upon the teacher. 
Perhaps it will be said that the plan here recommended 
will create, or tend to create, in the pupil constant depend- 
he Teach- ence upon the teacher; that we have too 
2 Help much combination work at present rather than eed not Be- 
get Depend- too little ; and that this is the very source of 
can the weakness in study and learning that marks 
the schools at the present time. There may well be too 
much help as well as too little. Moreover, the present 
trouble in the best schools is not that too much help 
or too little help is given, but that it is not rendered 
in the right way. Weakness and dependence are not 
necessary accompaniments of the assistance that the 
teacher renders the pupil; on the other hand, such assist- 
ance, if given in the right manner and measure, will rather 
engender strength and independence. The main difficulty 
at present is that teachers do not so much work wth the 
pupil as work for him, which is fatal to good habits of 
study and to good scholarship. The teacher’s function is 
not to fill up the pupil with knowledge as a demijohn is 
filled with water, but to enlist his faculties actively, and to 
guide them wisely, in the acquisition of knowledge. The 
late General F. A. Walker, in his celebrated Address on 
Arithmetic in the Boston Schools, said - 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
  54 THE ART OF STUDY. 
“The notion that exercises, either mental or physical, prescribed 
for young children, should be often up to the full limit of their powers, 
and should at times exceed those powers, is distinctly false. The true 
gymnastic for the growing child is through exercises easy and pleas- 
ant, which lead insensibly up to ever higher planes of attainment, as 
the faculties are expanded and strengthened, according to their own 
law of growth, through gentle and agreeable exercise. Wherever 
fatigue, confusion, and the sense of strain begin, there the virtue of 
the exercise ceases, whether for promoting the growth of the powers 
or for the training and disciplining of the powers as they exist. Loss 
and waste—it may be much, it may be little—begin at this point, and 
go forward, from this point, at a constantly accelerating ratio.” 1

CHAPTER VIII. 
THE STUDY-RECITATION. 
THE two words “lesson” and “recitation” are so 
closely associated in the minds of teachers and pupils 
that either one almost necessarily suggests the other. 
Nor is it easy to define either word without referring to 
the other. 
The first definition of “ lesson” is anything read or 
recited by a pupil or learner, as a portion of a book 
assigned to.a pupil to be studied or learned ‘The Word : ° 5 “Qesson.» at onetime. The’ -word comes from the Latin 
legere, to read, and suggests at once the art of 
study, as that art has been defined in the third chapter 
of this work. Not all the definitions of lesson, how- 
ever, involve the idea of reading or the idea of a book, 
but they all do involve the idea of something to be 
learned through effort. Still, the word suggests a book to 
the pupil, and I shall still continue to regard the lesson 
as a portion of a book assigned to a pupil to be learned 
at one time, or at least as a portion of knowledge that is 
assigned with reference to a book. Much of what will be 
said, however, is just as true of other lessons that are not 
taken from a book. 
The school definition of “ recitation” is the rehearsal of 
a lesson by a pupil to his instructor. The word is com- 
posed of the Latin re, again, and c7tare, to tell or to say, 
and means, according to its etymology, to tell or say 
55  
-P-A-G-E-56
  56 THE ART OF STUDY. 
something a second time. In the case of a pupil, the 
first telling or saying occurs, or is supposed to occur, 
rola when he prepares his lesson. Frequently the 
“Recita- Word is used in a wider sense to denote any 
ete teaching exercise in which both the pupil and 
the teacher take part. But, properly speaking, the word 
implies previous preparation, and so is much narrower in 
its application than teaching. Socrates’ conversational 
discussions and Jesus’ similar teachings, while both 
highly educative, were in no real sense either lessons or 
recitations. 
The two words are then correlative, and the two proc-

out in the last chapter; as, also, that the separation 
should not be forced or be effected at too early a 
day. Instead of a teacher unduly hastening the differen- 
tiation, thus throwing the pupil almost wholly upon his 
books as a source of teaching, he should seek rather to 
prolong their closer relation, only taking care that the 
character of the work done shall keep full pace with the 
pupil’s expanding powers. In other words, between the 
homogeneous work of the first primary grade and the

differentiated work of a later time should come a period 
marked by what I shall venture to call the study-recita- 
whe study. tion. As the name suggests, this exercise is 
Recitation neither all study nor all recitation, but is a com- 
De pound of the two, and so does not differ from 
the original work of the teacher and pupil except in its 
greater difficulty and the fact that the matter is drawn 
from a text-book. 
Reference was made on an earlier page to the German 
schools. The American teacher, when his attention is 
called to these schools for the first time, is German - a : 
Schools surprised by two circumstances: one the time 
Once More. that the pupils spend each day in school work; 
the other the excellent results that they achieve. The 
lehrplan or programme of a German gymnasium, for 
instance, includes some thirty hours of exercises a 
week, but our high school course includes about eighteen 
periods of forty-five or fifty minutes of such exercises, 
while the German boy on leaving the gymnasium is two 
years in advance of our boy on leaving the high school. 
The German elementary schools compared with our own 
present similar differences, save in the age of the pupils. 
Now what is the explanation of these strong contrasts ? 
In the first place, the hours set down in the German pro- 
gramme cover both the study and the recitation periods, 
the Teacher 25 We should call them, while our programme in- 
inGerman cludes the recitation periods only. The fact 
Schools. is, however, that German teachers, unlike our 
own, do not hasten the division of school work into study 
and recitation, but rather seek to check it. The teacher 
and the pupil go on together learning and teaching just 
as they began until long after the period where our formal 
lesson and recitation appear. The Germans, in a word, 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
  58 THE ART OF STUDY. 
make much less of the book in the school, and much more 
of the teacher, than we are accustomed to do. Their 
great instrument of teaching is the study-recitation. 
This fact explains in great part the large amount of time 
that the school exercises cover per day or per week. 
Secondly, the boys that pass through the German gym- 
nasium, as has been already stated, are a more select body 
of scholars than the boys who pass through 
euperiosity our high schools. Still, when all due allow- 
ecg ance is made for this difference, there remains 
: a considerable advantage on the German side. 
Again, no such reason can be given for the superiority of 
the pupils in the elementary schools. Perhaps it would 
be going too far to ascribe all this advantage to the su- 
perior teaching in the foreign school, as other elements 
may enter into the case, but, unquestionably, this is the 
main cause of such superiority. Moreover, there is good 
reason to think that the superiority of the German teach- 
ing consists largely in the constant employment, through 
a series of years, of the study-recitation. To explain 
more fully my meaning, I shall present some concrete ex- 
amples of German lessons or parts of lessons, prefacing 
them with the remark that there are differences in schools 
in Germany as in the United States, and that the diver- 
sities of method and practice are considerable. 
My first example will be an account of an exercise on 
the geography of Germany which I quote from the well- 
known work of Dr. L. R. Klemm: 
“ The teacher began by making a few simple lines rcpresenting the 
so-called ‘mountain-cross’ in Central Europe. After first drawing 
the Fichtel Mountains (see map), he added the Erz Mountains 
toward the northeast, the Franconian and Thuringian Forest toward 
the northwest, the Bohemian and Bavarian Forest toward the south-
-P-A-G-E-59

east, the Franconian and Swabian Jura toward the southwest. A 
few peaks were mentioned, as were also the character- A Study- ar : : Recitation istics of these mountains. Thus, for instance, the 
in Geog- silver mines in Saxony, the dense forests in Bohemia, the 
raphy. lovely scenery in Thuringia, the caves in the Jura, etc., 
came in for a few well-remembered remarks. The teacher always 
knew when to stop; he was discretion personified. 
  “ Now, the teacher drew the four rivers which rise in the Fichtel 
Mountains, namely Main, Saale, Eger, and Naab—showing and indi- 
cating on the map into what main rivers they empty. A few impor- 
tant cities and the countries around the cross were named. All this 
information was partly given, partly asked for, as the case suggested. 
“Now, the complete map, a printed one, was hung up and all the 
information just gained was looked up. Each item was noted and it 
made the children fairly glow with enthusiasm when they were able to 
corroborate the facts of the two maps. In a few points the map on 
the board was corrected, improved and completed; then the lesson 
closed, and now followed the recitation—that is to say, the pupils 
were called upon to state, in answer to leading questions, what they 
remembered of the lesson. My heart was filled with joy when. I

heard them speak out, not like human parrots who had memorized, 
but like rational beings who had learned by experience. The hour 
was brought to a close by an imaginary journey all over the section 
the acquaintance of which they had just made. Many little items of 
information were added on this journey. Photographic views of rocks 
and mountain scenery were exhibited, and they proved to be of in- 
tense interest to these children, who had no opportunities of seeing a 
mountain ‘in nature ’,”2 
My next example isan account of an exercise in geom- 
etry for which I am indebted to a professor of pedagogy 
AStudy- in one of our universities. The first thing that 
Recitation the visitor remarked was that the pupils had no 
in Geometry-+ oxt-book in their hands such as an American 
teacher puts into the hands of his class (that is, a book of 
theorems and fully developed demonstrations), but only a 
book of theorems to be demonstrated by the pupils and 
teacher working together. The particular lesson on this 
occasion was the Pythagorean theorem : the square des 
cribed on the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle is 
equal to the sum of the squares described on the other 
two sides, and it proceeded somewhat as follows: 
Teacher. What have we given in this proposition to base our 
work on? 
Answer. A right-angled triangle. 
Fi Teacher. You may draw such a figure 
on the board and letter it. 
Teacher. What does our proposition say 
5 ie about this figure ? 
Answer. That the square described on 
the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the 
squares described on the other two sides 
Teacher. 1s Fig.t. sufficient to illustrate this ? 
Answer, No. 
Teacher, Why not?

-P-A-G-E-61
THE STUDY-RECITATION. 61 
Answer, The sides of the triangle must have squares erected on 
them. 
Teacher. Complete the figure as you think necessary, adding 
letters, (Fig. 2). 
Teacher. We will now try to prove our theorem. In each square 
what are the relations of the sides ? 
Answer. The sides of each 
square are equal. 
Teacher. If we try to prove our 
theorem by triangles, can you sug- 
gest any lines that might help us? 
Perhaps the relation of the sides of 
the squares will help us. 
Answer. \f we draw diagonals 
from J to B and from Eto C (Fig. 3) 
we shall have AC of one triangle 
equal to JA of the other, and AB of 
the second triangle equal to AE of 
the first. 
Teacher. Will that prove the 
  Fic. 2. 
equality of those triangles ? 
Answer. No. 
Teacher. Why not? 
Answer. When we have two 
sides of one triangle equal to two 
sides of another triangle, the tri- 
angles will not necessarily be equal 
unless there is an angle in one equal 
to an angle in the other. 
Teacher, Have we such an 
angle? 
Answer. The angle CAE of the 
first triangle equals the angle JAB 
of the second since each of these 
angles is made up of a right angle and the angle CAB. 
Teacher. What can you say of line HC? 
Answer. It is the continuation of CB because the angles ACH 
and ACB are both right angles, 
  Fic. 3+ 
 
-P-A-G-E-62
    62 THE ART OF STUDY. 
Teacher. Can you see any relation between the triangle JAB and 
the square AH ? 
Answer. The triangle JAB has the same base, JA, as square AH, 
and the same altitude AC. ¥ 
Teacher. What does that prove? 
Answer. That the triangle JAB is one half of square AH. 
Teacher. Let us draw CK intersecting AB in L (Fig. 4). Can 
you see any relationship between the triangle CAE and the rectangle 
AK? 
Answer. It is the same relation that we have above; i. e., triangle 
CAE has the same base, AE as the 
rectangle AK, and the same altitude 
AL. Hence, triangle CAE is one 
half of AEKL. 
Teacher. WWhatrelation have we 
now between the rectangle AEKL 
and the square AH? 
Answer, They are equivalent, as 
they are twice the equal triangles 
CAE and JAB respectively. 
But it is not necessary to 
finish the demonstration. 
The teacher will get the idea. 
Dr. Klemm gives a long 
description of a lesson in grammar that he witnessed. I 
shall quote a part of it only. 
“A simple sentence was taken, such as 
  A Stud: 3 . Recitation ‘Father called.’ First the essential elements 
poe of the sentence, subject and predicate, were 
mentioned. 
Teacher. What question does ‘ father’ answer to? 
Answer. To the question, ‘ Who called ?’ 
Teacher. Mf 1 say ‘Father came,’ would the question be the same? 
Answer. No, sir; it would be, ‘Who came?’ 
Teacher,’ 1s not the interrogative, the questioning word ‘ who,’ 
the same in both questions ?
-P-A-G-E-63
  THE STUDY-RECITATION. » 63 
Answer, Yes, and that word is always answered by the subject. 
Teacher, We will note this in the corner of our blackboard 
thus : ‘Subject answers to the question who?’ But is that the only 
question the subject may answer ? 
Answer. If the subject is an animal or inanimate thing, we can- 
not ask ‘wo does this or that,’ but must say ‘what does?’ As, for 
instance, ‘The water bubbles. What bubbles?’ We can therefore 
add the word ‘what’ to the rule, so that it reads ‘ Subject answers to 
the questions who or what?’ (Teacher does SO.) 
Teacher. Why do you say ‘who or what?’ Why not “who 
and what ?’” 
Answer, Because it cannot do both; it can only do one of the 
two. 
Teacher, Are there any other questions to which the subject of a 
sentence may answer? Let us see. Open your Readers at page 17. 
Read, John. 
John reads. ‘The sun shines. Sun, the subject, answers to What 
shines?’ 
Fred reads. ‘The physician hurried to the spot. Here the sub- 
ject answers to the question who ?’ 
Other sentences are looked up, All the pupils agree that 
who and what are the only questions to which a subject may 
answer. 
Teacher, Then we have found a means by which we are able to 
detect the subject of any sentence. 
Pupils are then led to state that the nominative is the Wo or 
What case, and that the subject is invariably in that case. A note is 
made of the fact.” 
Next, the predicate was taken up in the same manner, and after- 
wards the modifiers. At the end of the lesson the blackboard con- 
tained notes of all the results that had been reached, which the boys 
copied down in their note-books, “The home lesson given out,” says 
Dr. Klemm, “ was to furnish a sentence from the history or reader 
which would illustrate these rules,” 1

Second and Third Years (Fourth and Fifth Grades). Historical tales

Fourth Year (Sixth Grade). Brief outline of Grecian and Roman 
history. Several parts dealt with in a more detailed way ; e. g., the 
Persian wars, Alexander the Great, the wars between the Romans 
and Germans, the invasion of the barbarians, historical compositions 
embracing both biographies and tales. Historical essays in the read- 
ing book read and explained. 
Fifth Year (Seventh Grade). History of the Middle Ages in Ger- 
many dealt with in the same way as the ancient history in the fourth 
year. Much stress laid upon the Crusades and the end of the Middle

the fourth year. 
Sixth Year (Eighth Grade), Modern times, especially in Germany. 
History of the Thirty Years’ War, the Seven Years’ War, the wars 
against Napoleon, and the war of 1870-71 dealt with in a complete 
manner. History of France from 1648 to 1815, chiefly the French 
Revolution. Tales, biographies, essays continued 5 longer composi- 
tions from the pupil than previously. 
In teaching history no text-book is used; only oral 
instruction by the teacher, and a few notes taken by the 
pupils. 
Such exercises could be greatly multiplied, but, as this 
is not a book of methods, I shall take leave of the subject 
by referring my readers to the books that deal with the 
pedagogical side of the German schools
-P-A-G-E-65
THE STUD Y-RECITATION. 65 
The method of the study-recitation is well illustrated 
by the laboratory method of instruction. The great 
value of such instruction is its concreteness 
and reality, since it brings the pupil into con- 
tact immediately, not with words and language, 
but with things. However, the teacher, if a competent one, 
does not turn his class loose in the laboratory to see what 
they will stumble upon, if left to themselves; he rather 
selects for his pupils, not only the line of work to be fol- 
lowed, but the particular experiments to be performed, 
and shows them how to perform them. He works with 
his pupils, just as the teacher of arithmetic, history, and 
grammar, at the same or an earlier stage of their zd- 
vancement, should do. As the pupils progressively 
learn the art of the laboratory, he leaves them more and 
more to themselves. The same method is followed in 
teaching bookkeeping and arithmetic in some commercial 
schools ; the class room is made a sort of laboratory. 
Again, the seminar of the German university, the sem- 
inary of the American university, exemplifies the same 
ideas. The great value of this instrument of 
education is that it enables the experienced 
teacher to teach a limited number of selected 
students the best method of carrying on original investi- 
gations, including especially the choice and handling of 
materials. The seminary stands to the library in the 
same relation that the laboratory stands to nature. 
Perhaps some critics will charge me with parading as a 
discovery a method that is perfectly well known in Amer- 
The Study- ican schools. Not at all; I am well aware that 
Hard much work is done in our schools that answers 
Schools. in a general way to the study-recitation. Still, 
much of this work seems to me to fail at the vital

-P-A-G-E-66
  66 THE ART OF STUDY. 
point of grounding the pupil in the art of study, at 
the same time that he is immediately assisted in acquiring 
knowledge. Telling a pupil the contents of a lesson is not 
teachinghim. The “ telling,” if telling it be, must be done 
in such a way as thoroughly to arouse the pupil’s active 
powers of acquirement. Those persons who are most 
familiar with the facts will be the first to deny that the 
study-recitations which have been given above lead merely 
to an easy receptivity on the part of the pupil and the 
first to assert that they do inculcate the art of study. 
“Come and let me show you how,’ ” says Professor James, 
“is an incomparably better stimulus than ‘Go and do it 
as the book directs.’” 
A physician and professor in a medical college, who has 
had much experience, also, as a common-school teacher, 
has remarked to me upon the eminent suitability of the 
terms “demonstrator” and “demonstrate” to express 
one of the teacher’s most important functions. ° There 
are demonstrators of anatomy and physiology, he says, 
in the medical schools, whose business it is to demon- 
strate, that is, point out or make plain, the facts of the 
human anatomy and physiology. Why should not the 
teachers of geography, history, etc., be considered as “ dem- 
onstrators” of their subjects in so far as it is their busi- 
ness to show to their pupils the facts comprising those 
studies ?

  CHAPTER IX. 
THE STUDY-LESSON. 
{r must not be supposed that the pupil’s ettorts to 
learn should end with the study-recitation. There is 
another and amore advanced stage of study that may be 
called the study-lesson, or simply the lesson in the cus- 
tomary sense of that word. The value or need of such 
an exercise, which has been more than hinted at already, 
calls for a word or two of emphasis. 
The educated person, in the accepted sense, must know 
how to use books as means of instruction, discipline, and 
cultivation. He is, measurably speaking, an in- 
dependent student. Reference may be made 
to the great efforts that have been made in re- 
cent years to bring the library into closer relation with 
the school. Thus, an excellent authority has said that 
Mr. S. S. Green, of Worcester, Massachusetts, had some 
years ago succeeded in linking the schools so closely with 
the public library of that city, of which he was the head, 
that he and the teachers, acting in concurrence, indirectly 
controlled the reading of the whole rising generation. 
To sketch the methods by which this great work had 
been accomplished is beside the present purpose, except 
to say that Mr. Green’s part of it was to bring suitable 
books in abundance within easy reach of the school chil- 
dren, while the teachers ‘ as city inspired them with Schools and 
Libraries. 
 
-P-A-G-E-69
  
  THE STUDY-LESSON. 69 
a love of good books and guided them in making their 
choice. The reading the pupils didalone.? 
Now it is clear that the end set forth in the last para- 
graph cannot be reached as a rule, that is, pupils cannot 
PC ac be brought to use books independently, unless 
Yearnthe they are so habituated in the schools. <A well- 
eee, nooke known American educator some years ago chools. 
wrote : “ At least three-fourths of all the time 
spent by a boy of twelve in trying to learn a hard lesson 
out of a book is time thrown away. Perhaps one-fourth 
of the time is devoted to more or less desperate and con- 
scientious effort; but the large remaining portion is 
dwindled away in thinking of the last game of ball and 
longing for the next game of tag.” 2 This is certainly 
a true presentation of the case, only I should hesitate 
to fix rigidly the age limit. Moreover, the fact stated 
is the great reason for the skillful employment in the 
school of the study-recitation. This impotence of the 
pupil to use books by himself must be overcome if he 
is ever to become a scholar; and it can be done in only 
one way — first, by preparing him to use books, and then 
setting him to use them himself. In making the transi- 
tion from the study-recitation to the study-lesson some 
time will necessarily be lost, but the pupil will be abun- 
dantly repaid if he really gets a firm hold of the art of study. 
The cardinal fact at this stage of the pupil’s progress 
vaine ofthe 18 that he must be left to learn his lessons 
Study- practically alone with his books. Whether he 
wesson. will succeed or not in this endeavor will de- 
pend upon a number of circumstances, some of which

should be formally stated. First, however, a word of in- 
sistence upon the daily lesson as a factor in the school 
regimen at the proper stage of progress. First and last, 
this embraces three stages, — assignment of the lesson, 
study, and the recitation. The assignment of the lesson 
can hardly be treated in too practical a manner. 
The first thing to be considered is that the pupil shall 
be ready for the lesson; or, to reverse the form of state- 
The Pup Ment, that the lesson shall be adapted to the 
pee pupil. Itis a well-known law of the human 
* mind that in learning we proceed from the 
known to the related unknown. The meaning of this is 
that when once a start has been made we acquire new 
facts, ideas, and thoughts by means of the facts, ideas, and 
thoughts that we already possess. It follows, therefore, 
that, if the new matter which we wish to learn is too 
widely separated from the old matter which we have 
learned; or, in other words, if the interval between the 
two is too great, we can learn it only imperfectly, or with 
great difficulty, or possibly not at all, as the case may 
be. Toask a pupil to learn a lesson in any subject that 
is not connected with his former lessons, and especially 
his last one, is like asking him to jump to the top of a 
rock that is above his head. This law of mind lies at the 
root of the pedagogical doctrine of apperception. 
What is mofe to our purpose, however, this law under- 
lies all graded courses of study and graded schools, all 
graded series of lessons and text-books, and all 
Peet thes: graduated teaching. From first to last sound 
education leads the pupil gradually, that is, 
by grades, up| the ascending heights of study or learn- 
ing. The words “grades” and “grading” are derived 
from the Latin noun gradus, a step or pace. We get the    
-P-A-G-E-71
    THE STUD Y-LESSON. 71 
conception in a flight of stairs by which one ascends to 
an elevation that one could never reach if left to clamber 
up a perpendicular surface ; or, better still, in a railroad 
track that ascends from a lower to a higher level by a 
moderate rate of ascent, or a moderate grade. 
This conception of fitness or adaptation of the pupil tothe 
lesson, or of the lesson to the pupil, is of first importance 
whe Naturai i education. The practical problem involved 
Orderof is a difficult one. Such questions as the natural 
Goo order, of studies—arithmetic, geography, his- 
tory, and the like; the natural order of topics or divisions 
of the study; the length of the successive steps both in 
the study and in the course of study,—have received a 
great amount of careful attention from teachers and 
educators since the beginning of the common school 
revival, sixty or more years ago. Before that time little 
had been done to solve them. 
For example, Horace Mann, who attended a district 
school in Massachusetts early in the century, afterwards 
Fetes complained bitterly that what was called the 
Mannon love of knowledge was, in his times, cramped 
aan into a love of books, because there was no such 
Readers of thing as oral instruction ; that, moreover, books 
pie tities designed for children were few and their con- 
tents meager and miserable ; and that, of all the mental 
faculties, the memory for words was the only one espe- 
cially appealed to, while the most comprehensive general- 
izations intended for men were given to the children in- 
stead of the facts from which these generalizations were 
formed.! Still more, Mr. Mann, characterizing in one of 
his reports the school readers that were in vogue in his 
schoolboy days, said:

  72 THE ART OF STUDY. 
“In many of the reading books now in use in the schools, the most 
pithy sayings of learned men, the aphorisms in which moralists have 
deposited a life of observation and experience, the maxims

Franklin, he could understand them, of course. While a 
child is still engrossed with visible and palpable objects, while his ju- 
venile playthings are yet a mystery to him, he is presented with some 
abstraction or generalization, just discovered, after the profoundest 
study of men and things, by some master intellect. . . . Erudite and 
scientific men, for their own convenience, have formed summaries, 
digests, abstracts of their knowledge, each sentence of which contains 
a thousand elements of truth that have been mastered in detail; and, 
on inspection of these abbreviated forms, they are reminded of, not 
taught, the individual truths they contain. Yet these are given to 
children, as though they would call up in their minds the same ideas 
which they suggest to their authors.” +

logical faculties or to experience, when they 
crave incident, tale, or parable. The practical man, if of 
a religious turn, is apt to hold the prudential maxims of 
the Book of Proverbs in high esteem—maxims that sum 
up in the tersest form the reflections of sages upon the ex- 
periences of human life ; maxims that are often paradox- 
ical, and many of which are not universally true. But 
there can hardly be found in the Bible materials that are 
less adapted to the pupil’s powers of digestion and assim- 
ilation, unless it may be the genealogies of the Books of 
Chronicles. Every qualified teacher knows full well how -

this is not the case, the remedy should be 
sought in his reclassification. Still it is not meant to 
discourage teachers from assisting pupils to overtake the 
class, who are not too far in the rear, but the contrary. 
2. It is also assumed that the text-book is a suitable one 
for the pupil to use. We do not here raise the question 
ASuitapie of the relation of oral and book teaching, as we

the book is not suitable, then the proper authority should 
supersede it with one that is suitable. But even if this is 
not done, or done at once, the teacher must still use some 
book, for few are the teachers who are able to dispense 
with it. Still sections of a book may be so faulty that 
the teacher who is able to do so will be justified in pass- 
ing them by and teaching the subject orally.?

should look carefully over the work to be done before its

how much ground the class will cover in a given period of 
time and willseek to apportion it properly. He will have 
his landmarks ahead. In a system of public schools, how- 
ever, it is no doubt necessary to have the work marked off 
year by year and term by term; but these divisions need 
not, and should not, be Bale observed.

AGtity. Paragraphs three and four may seem so simple 
and obvious as to make it unnecessary to cumber 
the page with them. The experienced superintendent, 
to his sorrow, knows better. The necessity for such 
elementary instruction may point to the presence of in- 
competent teachers in the schools, but the inference does 
not nullify the fact. The heedlessness that teachers, even 
of considerable service, sometimes show in these simple 
matters is discouraging. Some of them let the work drag 
along in the first part of the term and then, waking up to 
the situation, try to recover the opportunity that has been 
lost by driving at a reckless rate of speed to the end of 
the journey. Again, some teachers are vigorous in the 
beginning of the term or year; feeble in the Expansion 
of Points end. Others seem never to understand that 
parer and different portions of the subject differ greatly 
in difficulty, that one page may require more 
study than five or ten other pages, and that, therefore, the 
length of a lesson is no measure of the amount of work 
that its preparation involves. High-school teachers some- 
times measure off a lesson in Cesar or in Algebra with 
the page rule, without stopping to inquire whether the 
one is a piece of easy narrative or a difficult technical

description ; or the other, part of an ordinary demonstra- 
tion printed in full or a nest of hard problems. In oppo- 
sition to these mistakes must be set the rule that the 
teacher should assign each day a fair day’s work, and then 
see that this work is done. If the lessons are too light, 
the pupils are retarded in their progress and they become 
dissatisfied ; if the lessons are too heavy, the pupils will 
not be able to finish them, and so must go over thema 
second time, losing thereby interest and courage. Every- 
thing depends upon the tone of the school. If its inter- 
est and courage are to be maintained, the pupils must ac- 
complish something day by day—must, as a rule, actually 
do the work that is assigned them todo. Occasional fail- 
ures are valuable as a discipline anda spur ; but no teacher 
can‘hold a class up to the work on a regimen of failures. 
Success is the note of the good school. Too long lessons 
are harmful, even if the pupil finally accomplishes them, 
since he tends to lose his appetite for work. To keep pu- 
pils at work on lessons two or three days old is much like 
giving them dinners that have attained the same age. The 
measuring worm, as he ascends the wall, or moves along 
the ceiling, is no proper exampler for the teacher to fol- 
low in assigning lessons. 
5. Before assigning the lesson for the next recitation 
the teacher should carefully inquire whether the pupils 
need assistance in preparing it and, if the Rendering ont * ; Hetp when answer is in the affirmative, he should furnish 
faired: such assistance before they leave the recita- 
tion benches. Words in the lesson may need 
to be explained, points of difficulty to be set in a proper 
light, or important features to be pointed out. Frequent 
are the cases when a hint or two, a few suggestions, a 
short explanation, taking, perhaps, three or five minutes,

76 THE ART OF sacs i 
will save the class from falling to pieces or from “ flunk 
ing,” as the college expression is, at the next recitation. 
Much depends upon the relation of the last lesson to the 
new lesson. Subjects and lessons as presented in text- 
books do not always ascend by an easy grade, at least 
as measured by the pupil’s ability; some subjects and 
lessons hardly admit of such presentation. Not unfre- 
quently the proper figure to apply to the new lesson 
would be to call it a precipitous cliff, up which the 
class is expected to climb. If, in such a case, the class 
are left unaided, the best scholars may be found, when | 
recitation time comes, on top of the rock, but the majority | 
will be found at the bottom. 
6. Another fundamental requirement is that the pupil 
must know how to read and write, not only in the 
Reascing mechanical sense, but also in the intellectual 
how to sense ; that is, he must know how to get thought 
ae out of the printed page with a reasonable 
degree of certainty and facility, and to express his own 
thoughts in written language. To put my meaning in 
another way, it is assumed that the pupil has, in a measure, 
mastered the art of reading as an instrument of acquiring 
knowledge, and the art of writing as an instrument of im- 
parting knowledge. Upon these arts I shall not here 
enlarge, but only refer the reader to another work in which 
I have dealt with those important subjects.

of the century, seem almost incredible. See for example the one 
that Horace Mann gave of his early education. Page 71. 
Dr. Francis Wayland wrote a still more striking history of the 
teaching that he received from the master of a private school in New 
York, from which the following is an extract:

“He used but one motive to obedience—terror. The ferule 
and the cowhide were in constant use. He never taught us any- 
thing; indeed, he seemed to think it below his dignity. I do not 
remember anything approaching explanation while I was at the school. 
A sum was set, and the pupil left to himself to find out the method 
of doing it. If it was wrong, the error was marked, and he must try 
again. If again it was wrong, he was imprisoned after school, or 
he was whipped. 
“Tn other studies the text of the book must be repeated withort 
a word of explanation. Geography was studied without a map, by 
the use of a perfectly dry compendium. I had no idea what was 
meant by bounding a country, though I daily repeated the boundaries 
at recitation. I studied English grammar in the same way. I had 
a good memory, and could repeat the grammar (Lowth’s, I think) 
throughout. What it was about, I had not the least conception. 
Once the schoolmaster was visiting at my father’s,and I was called 
up to show my proficiency in this branch of learning. I surprised 
my friends by my ability to begin at the commencement and to 
proceed as far as was desired; yet it did not convey to me a single 
idea. Years afterwards, when I began to study Latin, and: found 
the relation of words to each other designated by terminations, and 
when the matter was explained to me, the whole of my past study 
came to me like a new revelation. I saw the meaning of what I 
had formerly, in utter darkness, committed to memory.” !

  CHAPTER X. 
ATTACKING THE LESSON. 
A quarter of a century ago the late Dr. Paul A. 
Chadbourne, President of Williams College, delivered an 
Pr a. able address before the American Institute of 
bourne on Instruction which he entitled ““ Waste of Labor 
Te ea in the Work of Education.” He began with 
pointing out that, while education is supposed 
to prevent waste of labor, it is itself accompanied by a 
great amount of such waste. He found the principal 
sources of this waste in imperfect teaching, teaching un- 
important things, want of thoroughness, a misapprehen- 
sion of the real purposes of study, errors in text-books, 
bad classification of pupils and students, irregularity of 
Be fe sce, want of enthusiasm on the part of the teacher, 
and neglect of moral training. These are all undoubted 
sources of waste, and still others can be enumerated. 
There are several sources of waste in the schoolroom— 
waste, that is, of the pupil’s time and energy. One of 
peepeiis: these sources is ill-constructed courses of study ; 
Lesson a a second, ill-chosen text-books; a third, ill-as- 
ecrece of signed lessons. And. then, when these are 
stopped, if stopped they are, there remain 
still others, as the study-lesson, the recitation-lesson, the 
review, and the examination. Now it is in the study- 
lesson that the pupil shows his mastery of his art. It is 
here that he reveals his ability or inability to study and 
78  
-P-A-G-E-79
ATTACKING THE LESSON. 79 
learn his lesson. The study-lesson is therefore the 
greatest of all the possible sources of waste in the school- 
room. Some of this waste is unavoidable, as the pupil 
must, in a sense, learn to save time and effort as he learns 
to save money,—by wasting; but the amount of such 
waste in the schools at the present time is far in excess 
of all reasonable requirements on this score. 
Careful investigation shows that the waste which ac- 
companies the study-lesson is due to one of two causes, or 
to both of them. One is lack of ability prop. Ignorance 
andlatk of ¢tly to attack the lesson, and the other lack 
Interest and of ability to sustain the attack when made. Courage. - . * - 
Again, these two defects are due to different 
causes. Inability to make the attack, or to make it as it 
should be made, is due primarily to ignorance; while in- 
ability to sustain it is due primarily either to lack of 
interest or to a feeble will. Ignorance here means failure 
to see and to grasp the question or questions that the 
lesson holds out to the learner. The two defects are not 
necessarily connected, since they spring from different 
roots, but they tend to run together and are often, if not 
commonly, found in conjunction. If a pupil fails to 
master his lesson because he does not know how to attack. .* 
it, his failure will generally tell disastrously upon his 
interest or courage; while feeble interest or courage 
shown in following up an attack is almost sure to appear 
in the attack itself. 
It is, therefore, quité¢clear that these are important 
matters, deeply concerning, first, the teacher and then the 
meeeirace. pupil. Much that has been said in preceding 
“ attacking chapters relates more or less directly to attack- 
the Lesson.” ing the lesson ; but it will be well, even at the 
cost of partially retracing our steps, to devote a special 
\
-P-A-G-E-80

chapter to the topic. Afterwards, sustaining the attack 
upon the lesson will occupy our attention through a 
series of chapters, which will not, however, bear that . 
name. Let us form a clear idea of what the phrase, “ at- 
tacking the lesson,” means. 
The first rule for the guidance of the pupil is to find out 
the subject of the lesson. What is it all about? is the 
whatthe first question to be asked. If the pupil has 
Lesson is been well trained in the study-recitation he will, 
ee from habit, as well as interest, ask this ques- 
tion; and, if the lesson has a fair degree of unity and com- 
pleteness in itself, he will have little or no difficulty in 
answering it. For example, the lesson is on Washington’s 
Virginia Campaign of 1781; on the method of solving a 
quadratic equation ; or on the attributes of the adjective. 
Some persons may think this rule is too obvious to 
be put in a book. Experienced teachers, however, 
know that pupils in the higher grades of the elementary 
schools, and in the high schools too, come to the reci- 
tation bench with only confused and general ideas of the 
subject of a lesson,—to say nothing of the subject-matter— 
when they suppose they have mastered the lesson. Rela- 
tive to these points, there is now a vast amount of 
blundering and heedlessness in the schools. Pupils begin 
to figure on mathematical questions and problems before 
they have half read them; or they begin to analyze sen- 
tences in grammar without having at all grasped their 
meaning. This is often seen in written examinations. 
We shall go back for a moment to consider the study- 
Barnett recitation. Here it is the teacher’s first business 
oe ae) to place directly and clearly before the pupil’s 
sons. mind the end or aim in view. Mr. P. A. 
Barnett, condemning the practice of those “trained”
-P-A-G-E-81
ATTACKING THE LESSON. 8r 
teachers who, in giving a set lesson, think it necessary to 
beat about the bush, in order to get the class to guess what 
they, are driving at by a process recalling the “ animal, 
vegetable, or mineral” game of our youth, gives the fol. 
lowing wholesome counsel : 
“In fact, the pupils begin by putting themselves into a thoroughly 
false attitude. They enter on a kind of guessing competition, striving 
to find out what is in the teacher's mind, what he wants them to say. 
This is bad teaching. Once upon a time, for instance, a master was 
about to give a lesson on marble to some small boys, and began, for 
some occult reason, by asking his class to tell him the names of vari- 
ous stones. He thus, ‘elicited,’ hearthstone, bluestone, granite, kerb- 
stone, sandstone — everything but marble. At last he tried another 
attack. ‘Do you ever,’ he asked, ‘go for walks on Sunday —in the 
: churchyard?’ ‘Yes, sir,’ said a little boy. ‘And what do you see 
there?’ ‘The tombstones.’ ‘ Well, don’t those remind you of another 
kind of stone? Think, boysthink!’ ‘Please, sir, brimstone.’ ” 
Mr. Barnett very justly says this teacher should have 
told his boys without any preface that he was going 
Hxceptions to give them a lesson on marble; there was 
tothe Rule. not the least reason for beginning his work by 
getting them to guess what was in his mind. He is 
equally right in saying that nothing can be gained by con- 
cealing from the class the immediate object of the instruc- 
tion. He makes an exception in the case of very young 
children, with whom the teacher, as a whet to the appetite, 
may start witha little brief mystery before he produces 
the apple which is to be the subject of the lesson; but 
even here he cautions the teacher not to tire out the 
slender powers of the children by setting them to guess- 
work before he comes to realinstruction. Perhaps another 
exception may be made. With older pupils the teacher 
may sometimes, in order to arouse curiosity or to enkindle 
Art of Study —6, 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
    82 LHE ART OF STUDY. 
interest, keep the subject dangling for a little time before 
their eyes ; but the practice eas:ly degenerates into abuse. 
For the kind of lessons that he has before his mind, Mr. 
Barnett’s model questions are right : “ Who can tell me 
anything about this apple? ... the equator? ... Milton’s 
versification 2” 1 
The next rule is that the pupil should seize the leading 
subdivisions of the lesson. The author of a text-book, if 
: he understands his business, will present his 
ee matter in such a form as to facilitate the process. 
Lesson to be]Te will, for example, express the general sub- 
Seized. . : : . E 
ject of his chapter in the title or heading, and 
then treat its leading features or subdivisions in single 
paragraphs or closely related paragraphs, each with its 
own side-head or sub-title. If the author has omitted these 
convenient aids—“ handles” they may be called, that 
enable the pupil to take hold of the lesson — the teacher 
‘should show him how to make them for himself. Thus 
the fourth of Sir Joshua Fitch’s Lectures on Teaching 
is on the subject of Discipline. The side-heads are “ The 
Teacher as an Administrator or Ruler,” “Obedience not 
to be had by Demanding It,” “ Commands to be Well Con- 
sidered before They are Given,” and so on to the end of 
the chapter. To fix the subject of such a lecture and the 
sub-heads firmly in mind is to make an attack upon the 
lesson that promises the fullest success. 
The next fact to be stated is that most lessons present 
Beers a few points which are so central that they are 
Points tobe keys to the whole subject ; while the next rule 
Carried. is that the pupil should seek to discover such 
points and make them his own. We are using a military

metaphor. When General Grant had carried Missionary 
Ridge, the whole Confederate position far to the right 
and far to the left fell easily and speedily into his hands, 
Returning to an old topic, while the pupil should be 
prepared by the study-recitation to attack the lesson, still, 
over and above such preparation, the teacher Helpatthe , : : Assignment Will often find it necessary to render special 
os assistance when the lesson is assigned, as has 
been remarked in the last chapter. As there 
stated, in substance, a few words serving to focalize the 
pupil’s mind upon the proper point or points of attack 
will make all the difference between a lesson well pre- 
pared and a total failure. Teachers do not always appre- 
ciate the difficulties that new lessons offer to the minds of 
pupils, and especially when the specific subjects are new. 
Many lessons may be likened to balls that are too large 
for the catcher’s hands, so that he is unable to seize and 
hold them. ‘ 
Perhaps the main point of the present chapter can be 
made still more definite and concrete. Let us take a 
problem in mathematics. 4 
Our word “ problem ” is from the Greek noun problema, 
which comes from the verb proballein, to throw forward. 
A“Pprop- The problem is conceived of as something that 
ee is thrown forward by a questioner to an 
answerer. The two stand in the relation of the pitcher 
and the catcher in a game of base-ball. The pitcher is 
the teacher or author; the catcher is the pupil. And the 
pupil catches the ball when he understands the problem, 
or sees what it means, no matter whether he can solve it 
or not. Similarly, many other lessons may be looked 
upon as balls thrown to pupils for them to catch. 
It will be seen, of course, that the attack upona lesson is 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
    84 THE ART OF STUDY. 
always an act of analysis. The mind bites into the lesson, 
so to speak, with a view to separating it, as the teeth bite 
into an apple. 
Once more, the successful student must have correct 
ideals of study and of preparation. He must know what 
correct. 8 Tequired of him; must know when a lesson 
Ideaisof is prepared, or what preparation consists in. 
See roa It is not only possible but easy, as experienced 
teachers know, for pupils, especially if they have 
affluence of language, to talk or write quite entertainingly 
about things that they do not at all understand. Knowing 
about a thing is not the same as knowing the thing. A 
pupil may have considerable knowledge about the cru- 
sades, or about geysers, and not have a clear idea of 
what a crusade was ora geyser is. No rule relating to 
the subject is more important than that pupils shall know 
what they are doing. 
It may be said that in these matters much depends 
upon the subject and the study, and that there are differ- 
Such Ideats ent ideals of preparation rather than a single 
ee ideal. This is perfectly true. Manifestly the 
pupil who should prepare his lessons in arith- 
metic, history, and grammar in the same way would 
make a mess of it. Mathematics, and to a great extent 
the sciences as well, present to the mind definite ques- 
tions to be answered, or strict chains of reasoning to be 
followed and mastered. No element can be omitted in 
either case without vitiating the whole process. To alog- 
ical mind the method is perfectly intelligible. At the 
same time, this method is wholly inapplicable to history, 
geography, or literature. For example, a lesson in history 
is something like a landscape, a learner of the lesson like 
apainter. The painter, after due examination, selects
-P-A-G-E-85
  ATTACKING THE LESSON. 85 
some favored spot from which he can take in the whole 
scene; the ground rises and falls; the river winds here, 
Mathe- and the road runs there ; field and wood, village 
See and farm, fill in the view, as it presents itself to 
his eye. He does not attempt to reproduce 
on his canvas all that he sees, but only those features 
of the scene which give it character and individuality,— 
what may be called the essential elements of the land- 
scape. The amount of filling in will depend upon the 
scene itself and the size of his canvas. No doubt this 
illustration may be so pressed as to make it teach -error. 
My contention is only that the fruitful study of the his- 
tory of a country or an age leaves the pupil’s mind in 
much the same state that the painter of the landscape 
leaves his canvas. 
There is one rule which is of universal application, 
viz.: the teacher must remember that words are not ideas. 
Reedeac: Leds true enough that words, in a secondary 
Ideas. sense, are things, and so are proper subjects of 
study, as in etymology, but the primary office of words is 
to convey meaning. Montaigne said that “to know by 
heart is not to know,” while learning by heart is equally 
not to learn. There are indeed certain exceptions to 
be mentioned hereafter. To some minds the verbal 
clothing of ideas and thoughts will cling to them as the 
bark clings to a tre¢, or the skin to an animal, but this is 
not true of most minds and it is not desirable that it 
should be. The ordinary pupil will emphasize either 
substance or form, and if he emphasizes form he will not 
emphasize substance. After his teaching days were over, 
General Garfield used to tella story of a member of a 
class in surveying that he had taught. The text-book used 
contained a picture and a detailed description of a theod-
-P-A-G-E-86
  86 THE ART OF STUDY. 
olite, both of which the class were requiredto study since 
the school did not possess a real theodolite. Thestudent 
etakcai in question, on being called upon, gave a full 
Garfield’s description of the instrument and then sat 
oad down, having made what was considered a very 
brilliant recitation. But before the close of the hour 
some incident, as a remark by the student, or perhaps a 
question by the teacher, revealed the fact that this student 
had no idea whatever of the construction or the use of the 
instrument that he had described so minutely. He had 
extraordinary power of verbal memory, and had simply 
memorized the author’s description as he would have mem- 
orized a declamation. The language had adhered to his 
mind just as paint will sometimes adhere to the hand. 
The teacher must remember that the pupil’s attack 
upon the lesson is different from the teacher’s own attack. 
pieceubitis The pupil is interested in the academical, the 
Attack and teacher in the pedagogical, view of the lesson. 
Baia: The aim of the one is to learn the lesson, the 
upon a aim of the other to teach it. The academical 
Hesson- view necessarily precedes the professional one. 
Even the normal school, when it teaches academical 
studies, has its own way, or should have its own way, of 
looking at them. It is the work of the normal school, as 
Dr. Harris has said, to lead the student to reéxamine all 
his elementary branches in their relations to the higher 
ones. He goes on to say: 
“The Normal school, therefore, took up just this work at the be- 
Dr. Harrie &'nning, and performed it well. It induced in the young 
on the men and women, preparing for the work of teaching, 
Normal the habit of taking up the lower branches in their re- 
School. lations to the higher—taking them up constructively, as 
it were. For, to study arithmetic in the light of algebra and
-P-A-G-E-87
ATTACKING THE LESSON. 87 
geometry is to study it constructively. Its rules are derived from 
algebraic formulz, and are to be demonstrated by algebraic processes. 
So the details of geography have their explanation in the formative 
processes of land and water as treated in physical geography, 
and the sciences of which it is acompend. Of course this demands 
a high standard of preparation in those who enter the Normal school. 
The higher the better, for they should be able to review the lower 
branches in the light of all human learning.” 1 
This is true enough in its own place, but the teacher 
must not forget to return to the place of beginning. The 
successful teacher is always able to place himself at the 
pupil’s point of attack. 
The character of the pupil is formed, so far as the 
school serves to form it, by the regimen and tone that 
Regimen of @'¢ habitually maintained. Every teaching ex- 
the School ercise should be considered under two aspects: 
ce one the direct contribution that it makes to 
Character. the pupil’s knowledge; and the other its dis- 
ciplinary results, or its effect upon his habits and char- 
acter. The two results, while causally connected, are not 
measures one of another. Now the good school gener- 
ates courage and self-reliance, which it can do only upon 
the condition that the pupils shall succeed in their 
lessons far more frequently than they fail. It is well 
enough for the pupil to be “stumped” occasionally, 
and there is a discipline in temporary failure, perhaps in 
permanent failure, but success should be the habit of the 
school. Moreover, success cannot be the habit if too 
much is required of the pupil. The regimen under which 
the child grows up should not be flabby, but relatively 
strenuous. Still, in the early period of character forming,

he should be shielded as far as possible from excessive 
demands upon his attention, his faculties of judgment 
and thinking, and especially his power to resist tempta- 
tion; nor should he be overexposed to them in a later 
period, when his character is better formed.

CHAPTER XI. 
THE RECITATION-LESSON, 
Wuat the recitation means to American teachers and 
writers on teaching has been explained in a general way 
on an earlier page. How important they con- 
fee pee ceive it to be is shown by the place that is 
American accorded to it in the school and in books and 
Schools. lectures on teaching. It is no exaggeration to 
say that a large majority of them look upon it as the prin- 
cipal feature of the school. Authors who have never a 
word to say about the art of study have whole chapters 
on the recitation, while a great many teachers, failing to 
render their pupils needed assistance in learning their 
lessons, see the fulfillment of their duty in assigning 
lessons and hearing recitations. 
It is, therefore, curious to observe that English teach- 
ers and writers on teaching never use the word “ recita- 
Unknownin tion” at all in our familiar sense of it. A 
English leading London journal, speaking of a new 
ee American book on education not long ago, 
thought it necessary to explain to its readers the author’s 
use of the word. English teachers have the thing but 
not the name; they call it the “lesson.” 
It may be said that if English teachers have the thing 
it cannot matter whether they have the name or not. I 
am not so sure that this is the case, but rather think that 
they have the advantage ee us. First, 1am not quite

sure that they do have precisely the same thing, but 
however that may be, it is certainly easier for the English 
teacher to avoid the fatal habit of thinking that his 
great function is to conduct recitations or “to hear 
lessons” than it is for the American teacher. If we 
could in some way get rid of the word it would be easier 
to free the American school from the slavery that the 
recitation now imposes upon it. Since, however, that is 
undoubtedly impossible, we must make up our minds to 
accept the name with all its unfortunate associations, and 
do what we can to improve the recitation itself. Sol 
submit to my fate, and contribute my chapter to the liter- 
ature of the subject. 
And first, I must emphasize the fact that the recitation 
should not be thrown out of the school. This becomes ap-

teacher to report what he has learned in the 
study-lesson, and to receive needed instruction in connec- 
tion with the subject. In view of what was said early in 
this boak, it should not now be necessary to do more than 
repeat that such an exercise has no place early in the 
school course, and. that often the mistake is made of 
throwing it too soon and too far to the front. At the 
same time, the study-recitation, valuable as it is, will not 
do either one of two things, which must, however, 
be done at the same time,—ground the pupil in knowl- 
edge or ground him in the art of study. There comes 
a time in the progress of the pupil when he can learn 
more in half an hour in the study-recitation than in 
an hour in the study-lesson, and yet should make the 
present sacrifice since it is essential to future progress,

The pupil will never become an independent worker un- 
less he learns to work independently ; he will never get 
much real hold of the art of study as an instrument save 
by practicing that art. Hence the great importance of 
the transition from oral teaching to the book, and of the 
passage from the study-recitation to the study-lesson and 
the recitation-lesson. Perhaps at no point is the teach. 
er’s art more severely taxed. So much for prelimi- 
naries. 
Attacking our subject directly, we find that it can be 
separated into two main subdivisions—aim and method, 
eee or the objects of the recitation-lesson and 
Objects of the means or steps by which those objects shall 
acc be reached. The relations of the two topics, 
and of the order in which they should be 
treated, are too obvious to call for formal remark. 
J. THE OBJECTS OF THE RECITATION-LESSON, 
This topic opens a considerable breadth of educational 
territory, but we must confine ourselves to essential fea- 
tures. The main objects of the recitation-lesson are the 
following: 
1. To give pupils an opportunity to report to their 
teacher what they have learned of the lesson previously 
assigned, or to reveal to him what they know 
of the subject. That is, to enable them to 
show how they have employed their time, or to give an 
account of their stewardship. Here the pupil holds the 
floor. That this is the first object of the recitation 
results from the relations of the exercise to past lessons 
and future lessons. 
2. To enable the teacher to discover and correct the Reporting.

pupils’ ignorance of the lesson, including their errors and 
misconceptions, The teacher now becomes 
more prominent than before; he not only re- 
ceives but also criticises and corrects the reports that the 
pupils make him. 
3. To enable the teacher to add to the pupils’ knowl- 
edge of the lesson or subject, by means of a more 
thorough discussion of the knowledge that the 
pupils have themselves acquired, and by pro- 
ducing new knowledge. It is clear that the teacher now 
becomes still more prominent than in the function 
of criticism and correction. 
4. To enable the teacher to prepare the way for the 
next lesson and recitation. To be sure, the ends already 
named constitute a part of such preparation, 
but it is only a part. Mention must also be 
made of the assignment of the next lesson, such explana- 
tion as it may call for, and any special knowledge that 
the pupil may need in the ensuing study-lesson. 
5. To enable the teacher to observe the ways in which 
pupils do their work, and to correct them when neces- 
sary; in other words, to give the teacher an Correcting.

edge, his pupils are also getting the art of 
study. 
6. To enable the members of the class to compare their 
facts and ideas, to bring their views of the lesson to- 
Beeb con: gether, to supplement one another’s knowl- 
parisons of ¢dge,—in a word, to enter into that legitimate 
ape emulation without which a good school is 
impossible. This is by no means the least 
benefit flowing from the recitation; perhaps some would 
say it is the greatest.
-P-A-G-E-93
  THE RECITATION-LESSON. 93 
These are the primary objects of the recitation-lesson, 
stated in their natural order. They have been presented, 
it will be observed, in terms of knowledge rather than of 
power, in the phraseology of objective not of subjective 
pedagogy, for the very obvious reason that for the present 
purpose thisis the most effective form of statement. The 
propositions, however, can be readily expressed in the 
other form. 
Again it will be seen that the recitation, like man 
himself, looks before and after, and that, like him, it looks 
Looking Be- after for the sake of before. What the pupil 
foreand has done, from the teacher’s point of view, is 
eect valuable chiefly because it is the platform on 
which he will stand while carrying his structure still 
higher. 
The principal subordinate ends of the recitation can 
only be enumerated. They are such as these: to enable 
Subordinate the teacher to judge of the efficacy of his 
Ends. method and to test his own skill; to furnish a 
valuable language lesson ; to give the pupil an opportunity 
to classify and expand his thoughts through expression; 
to develop confidence and self-command in the pupil; to 
imprint the lesson more deeply on the mind; to develop 
quickness of apprehension and thought ; to stimulate the 
pupils to renewed activity, and to disclose to the teacher 
their mind and character. 
II. STEPS OF THE RECITATION-LESSON. 
Here, as before, the view must be confined to the most 
Mretioaioe Uaportant features of the subject. ; 
Conducting The first question is whether there is any 
Recitations. universal method, or any order to which 
all recitations, or all good recitations, must conform.
-P-A-G-E-94
  94 ‘ FHEVART OF, STUDY. 
Stated in this way, the question must be answered 
in the negative. Much depends upon the subject, the 
Noinflex. Stage of the subject that has been reached, the 
ible Method. ny pil, the teacher's aim, and the means at hand. 
To quote from Mr. P. A. Barnett: 
“There are no ‘methods’ which we can apply rigidly to stated 
cases. The only infallible prescription is that the teacher should be in- 
fallible; for so we come back to the greatest of all teaching rules: 
to become good teachers we must teach well. The best we can 
do is to take the pupil by the hand and to feel the way wth him, 
not merely for him.” 1 
_ And yet we must agree with the common opinion that, 
as this writer expresses it, “in the midst of all diversity 
ButaGen- the true type of teaching is constant. The 
eralType. diversity arises inside the universal scheme, 
which all good teachers follow ; the differences are in de- 
tails, which are modified to suit individual cases, but in 
details only. The main process alters only in so far as its 
stages are more explicit or less explicit.”? This type is 
universal because good teachers have always tended to 
approximate it, but few of them have given it an articu- 
late form. In fact, it was first formulated by Herbart and 
his disciples, in what they called the “formal steps of 
teaching,” viz.: preparation, presentation, comparison, 
generalization, and application. These steps will now be 
briefly explained. 3 
First, however, the aim of the lesson should be clearly 
eetse stated to the pupil, because (1) the pupil’s 
Lesson mind is thus focalized upon the subject; (2) 
gited: the pupil is placed in the midst of a newcircle 
of ideas that claim his attention and which at once call up

his old and related ideas; (3) expectation, which is an 
important form of interest, is excited, while (4) the 
child, stimulated by a clear perception of what he is 
expected to do, makes an effort’to do it, or to use his 
will. 
1. Preparation. — This consists in freshening up and call- 
ing clearly to the mind of the child older ideas that 
Prepara. bear upon the new ones, and, by their simi- 
tion. larity, explain and assist the understanding of 
the new. In the language of our special subject, the rela- 
tion of the last lesson to the present one is made plain. 
In this way the soil of the mind, if the expression may be 
allowed, is gotten ready for the newseed. This step con- 
sists plainly enough of analysis, 
2. Presentation.—- This step involves joining on the 
new lesson to the old one, or the new ideas and facts 
Presenta. to the old ideas and facts; or, to employ the 
tion. former figure, the new seed is cast into the 
ground which has been prepared for it. 
3. Comparison (also called Association). — This step 
brings together in the mind the newly-won ideas, com. 
Compari- pares them with one another, with older ideas 
Ores and with additional new ideas that will be pre- 
sented—it compares the new and the old and combines 
them into one complete whole. This step is analytic in’ 
the beginning, but synthetic in the end. 
4. Generalization (also called System).— This means 
the inference from the data now present in the mind of 
Generatiza- a principle, law, general statement, or what in 
(ion. matters of practice is called a rule. This is an 
act of induction, and, in the narrow sense of the term in- 
duction, is synthetic, since the particulars are made to 
converge in one general truth.
-P-A-G-E-96
  
  96 THE ART OF STUDY. 
3. Application (or Practical Application). — The fourth 
step leaves the mind in possession of a general or ab- 
stract idea. But general ideas are not of prac- 
tical value until they are applied to new cases 
or particulars. And teaching is incomplete untilthe pupil 
is shown how to make such applications for himself. 
This step, which is purely deductive, will claim our atten- 
tion again in a future chapter. : 
Such are the steps involved in the complete teaching 
process. It is almost needless to say that many teaching 
processes do not embrace all these steps, and so are in- 
complete; they are, for the time, defective at the begin- 
ning, middle, or end. Still more, it is often perfectly 
proper that teaching processes should not embrace all 
these steps since that is neither possible nor necessary. 
These are abridged teaching processes} 
We may now put the three learning exercises of the 
school and the five formal steps of teaching in parallel lines. 
It is plain that the steps may all fall into the study-recita- 
tion, although that is not so much the proper place for ap- 
plications as it is for the earliersteps. Plainly, too, the five Application. 
1A recent review of Mr. Barnett’s, Common Sense in Education and 
Teaching, illustrates the five formal steps in the following manner: “ Take, 
for instance, a proposition of Euclid, The first step, that of Preparation, 
is found in the preceding propositions. The second step, of Presentation, 
appears in the general enunciation, followed by the construction and the 
application of the enunciation to that construction. The third step, Com- 
parison, follows when the subsidiary lines are drawn and the different 
parts of the figure are considered, with the result for the construction. 
The fourth step, Abstraction, is taken when it is considered that the like 
would be true of any similar construction, so that the proposition may be 
stated in general terms. But the theorem is certainly not yet understood, . 
unless the pupil is now able to take for himself the fifth step, that of 
practical Application.”— Zhe Nation, No. 1811, p. 210.

steps may all occur in the study-lesson, if we may speak 
Learning Of the pupil as being his own teacher. And, 
pees finally, it is equally plain that all the steps 
allel Lines. May be taken in the recitation-lesson, although 
most of the work involved in preparation, and 
much of that involved in presentation, falls naturally into 
the study-recitation and the study-lesson. 
Intimately connected with the recitation is the art of 
asking questions. Questioning is sometimes called a probe 
Art of Ques- With which the teacher examines the pupil’s 
Honing. = mind as a surgeon examines a wound; and some- 
times a plummet with which the teacher sounds the depths 
of the mind, asa sailor measures the sea with hislead. It is 
indeed both a probe and a plummet, but it is far more — 
it is a magician’s wand with which new knowledge is sum- 
moned into life. Skillful questions cause the pupil to 
define his facts ; to clarify his ideas ; to put facts and ideas 
together in new relations; to compare; to judge, and to 
draw inferences, —mental operations which develop our 
higher knowledge. Socrates, borrowing the name from 
his mother’s trade, called his method maieutic, and the in- 
strument with which he assisted his pupils to give birth to 
the children of their minds was questioning. We must, 
therefore, pay more than passing attention to this art. 
Sir J. G. Fitch recognizes three kinds of questions, the 
Three kinds preliminary, or experimental ; the one employed of Ques- ee . 4 Aone: in instruction; and the one employed in ex- 
amination ; and defines them as follows: 
“ There is, first, the preliminary or experimental question, by which 
an instructor feels his way, sounds the depths of his pupil's previous 
knowledge, and prepares him for the reception of what it is designed 
“to teach. 
“Then, secondly, there is the question employed in actual énstruc-

-P-A-G-E-98
98 THE ART OF STUDY. 
tion, by means of which the thoughts of the learner are exercised, and 
he is compelled, so to speak, to take a share in giving himself the 
lesson. 
“ Thirdly, there is the question of examination, by which a teacher 
tests his own work, after he has given a lesson, and ascertains whether 
it has been soundly and thoroughly learned.” + 
The first of these questions goes naturally with what 
the Herbartians call preparation, the second with presen- 
tation, the third with comparison. While all 
three may be used in the study-recitation, the 
first and second fall there more naturally. 
Again, the third question belongs especially to the reci- 
tation-lesson, and here it is employed mainly in testing 
what the pupil has learned. The instruction question 
is serviceable in imparting real knowledge. ‘The emi- 
nent teacher referred to by Fitch, who said he first 
questioned the knowledge zxto the mind of the child and 
then questioned it out again, used, in the first instance, the 
instruction question, and inthe second one, the examina- 
tion question. 
As to the character of the teacher’s questions, we need 
only repeat the same writer’s admonitions, that such 
questions should be clear, terse, pointed, and capable of 
being answered not with a mere yes or no or with a single 
word. They should be continuous, and such that the 
pupil may fairly be expected to answer them. 
Still another rule is that the questioning should not all 
Fitchon be confined to the teacher. Thisrule, Sir J. G. 
Ques- . : . 
Honing. Fitch puts in a paragraph so admirable that I 
shall venture to quote it in full: The Use of 
Each Kind. 
“The art of putting a good question is itself a mental exercise of

some value, and implies some knowledge of the subject in hand. You 
are conscious of this when you yourselves interrogate your class. 
Bear this in mind, therefore, in its application to the scholars. Let 
them occasionally change their attitude of mind from that of receivers 
and respondents to that of inquirers. Remember Bacon’s aphorism, 
Prudens guaestio, dimidium sctenttae. Youare halfway to the knowl- 
edge of a thing, when you can put a sensible question upon it. So I 
have sometimes heard a teacher towards the end of a lesson appeal to 
his pupils, and say to them one by one, ‘ Put a question to the class 
on what we have learned!’ To do this, a boy must turn the subject 
round in his mind a little and look at it ina new light. The knowl- 
edge that he is likely to be challenged to do it will make him listen to 
the lesson more carefully, and prepare himself with suitable questions ; 
and whether he knows the answer or not, there is a clear gain in 
such an effort. The best teachers always encourage their scholars to 
ask questions. The old discipline in the Mediaeval Universities of 
posers and disputations, in which one student proposed a thesis or a 
question, and another had to answer it, was not a bad instrument for 
sharpening the wits. In a modified way, it may be well to keep this 
in view, and to set scholars occasionally to question one another,” 1 
It may be added that Alcuin, the great teacher at the 
court of Charlemagne, required his scholars to ask the 
questions while he answered them. 
It isimportant to remember that questions may be in 
excess of the legitimate use of the school. They are 
almost purely analytical, and therefore leave 
onQues- knowledge in fragments. “The excessive use Mr. Barnett 
Honing. of questions,” says Mr. Barnett, “is a worship 
of mere machinery.” In particular, the habit that puts all 
or most of the questions in the mouth of the teacher is a 
part of that ill-adjustment of the teacher to the pupil 
which it is the purpose of this book to correct. In the 
words of the author just quoted: 
1 Lectures on Teaching, New York, E. L. Kellogg & Co., 1886, Chap. vi 
p- 172. 
 
-P-A-G-E-100
100 THE ART OF STUDY. 
“ After all, it should be remembered that in the common order of 
nature it is the person needing instruction who usually asks questions, 
not the person giving it. Why should the nature of things be topsy- 
turvy in the schoolroom? It is not so at home. Why should the 
questioner in school be almost always the teacher instead of the 
learner? Our business is to make our scholars feel the lack of infor- 
mation, desire to ask questions ; to encourage them to find out what 
they can for themselves, and to be keen to hear what we have to add 
to their stock. Z%ey must, in fact, question ws, or, at all events, 
stand in the attitude of those who want to know.”1 
Nowhere is it more important than in the recitation to re- 
“member that language is not knowledge. Hobbes has said 
Medcuade that words are the counters of wise men, the 
not Knowl- money of fools. To study is to get knowledge 
cree: out of the printed page; to recite is to express 
knowledge in oral or written words; but experience shows 
that, comparatively speaking, knowledge tay be omitted 
in both cases. The pupil, especially if gifted with verbal 
memory, naturally falls into that mistake, since he must, 
at recitation time, have “ something to say”; the regimen 
of the school often invites the mistake, and fond parents 
sometimes glory in its results. Hence the teacher must 
stand guard at this point, resorting freely to the two great 
correctives, — questioning and the study of concrete real- 
ities?

2 None but those who have looked curiously into the matter have much 
idea of the extent to which children, and even adults, are ignorant of 
the meaning of words that are perfectly familiar to them. Dr. Trumbull, 
the distinguished writer on Sunday-schools, tells some amusing anecdotes 
that illustrate the fact. First, he mentions the boy in Mrs. Horace Mann’s 
school who didn’t want to be good because he thought it meant “ ter-be 
whipped.” He tells of an old church member, commonly supposed to be 
intelligent in Scripture, who did not know what Christ’s “passion” men-

At the same time, to say that a child should learn 
nothing by heart is to commit an error almost equal to 
saying he should never be told anything that 
he can find out for himself. Some things he 
should learn by heart, as many of the formulas 
in which knowledge is compactly expressed. Mention 
may be made of the multiplication table, mathematical 
definitions and axioms, the definitions and rules of gram- 
mar, some of the symbols of chemistry, the canons of 
formal logic — about these there can be no question, pro- 
vided always the pupil’s studies take so wide a range. 
Then the child should, first and last, memorize a certain 
amount of literature, especially poetry. Literature con- 
sists of two elements, the conceptions of the author and 
the words in which he expresses those conceptions — the 
substance and the form. The thought is in the words, 
just as the painter’s thought is in the canvas, or the sculp- 
tor’s in the marble, and the two cannot be separated with- 
out destroying the literature. The inference is not that 
the pupil should commit to memory all the literature that 
he studies, much less all that he reads, but that he should 
commit enough to furnish his mind with a fund of beauti- 
ful literary forms. To this end, what are technically Learning

of a bright Sunday-school scholar, twenty-five years old, who asked who 
“the despised Galilean” was. The Doctor found also that one of his own 
daughters, who was familiar with trees and meadows, did not know what 
“ the woods” was, and winds up with a farm boy who, as he left for church 
on Sunday morning, was directed by his mistress to remember where the 
minister’s text was. He reported on his return, “I don’t quite know, 
Ma’am, but I think it was somewhere down by the door!” The fact was, 
he had spent the morning, not in listening to the sermon, but in trying to 
discover the place of the text.—See Teaching and Teachers, H. Clay Tram

called “recitations,” which are so prominent a feature on 
exhibition days, are to be encouraged within proper 
bounds. Still more, the admonition that children should 
understand what they learn, which is a plain intimation 
that, to the popular mind, learning does not always in- 
volve understanding, need not be too rigidly insisted 
upon, The child should not be allowed to fill his mind 
with words, but literary appreciation is a thing of degrees, 
and we grow up to great literary compositions. 
The language of the lesson, like the matter itself, 
should be adapted to the pupil’s capacity. The 
LanguagetoYOung pupil, for example, cannot take his

tothe Pupil: Guantities. To present to him a large subject, 
especially in unfamiliar words, is like holding out to him 
a loaf of bread, expecting him to eat it at a single mouth- 
ful. As Dr. Harris has said: “The child’s mind cannot 
seize great syntheses. He bites off, as it were, only small 
fragments of truth at best. He gets isolated data, and 
sees only feebly the vast network of interrelations in the 
world. This fragmentary, isolated character belongs 
especially to primary education.” 
A sentence or two will suffice respecting the relative 
value of oral and written recitations. Both should be 
Oratana used in proper proportions; oral recitations 
Seciceial develop quickness of thought and expression, 
versatility, and fullness of ideas; written reci- 
tations develop definiteness and accuracy of knowledge 
and terseness and compactness of expression. 
A few words will suffice also for what the pupil forgets. 
It 1s true enough that, in so far as he uses his knowl- 
edge as he goes along, it has present practical value, but 
in respect to his future lessons the knowledge that he

gain to-morrow. Thus viewed, knowledge that Forgotten ‘ : : Knowledge. is forgotten, it may be forever, has its lasting 
uses. The builder’s scaffolding is temporary,

eae Some teachers, again, require prompt answers, 
others ,are content with_slow ones; the proper 
rule is the golden mean. If the teacher allows too little 
time to pupils they tend to become agile but superficial ; 
if too much time, they tend to inattention and indolence. 
Radestock says: ‘‘ The child must be accustomed to give 
one impression time to take root, and not follow it im- 
mediately by a corresponding action, that it may not pass 
away with that action into air.” Healso quotes Lazarus: 
“Deep thinking requires time; it is, therefore,a great 
pedagogical mistake if teachers—as is now generally done 
—urge their pupils to answer rapidly, and praise those 
who immediately have an answer ready. This causes 
everything to be lowered to a mere effort of me- 
chanical memory. The pupils should be given time for 
individual contemplation, for deep and energetic thought- 
labor.” 1 If a strong scholar, the teacher is apt to over- 
estimate the ability of his class, especially in connection 
with the time that they require to see through things, or to 
think them out. This is one reason why strong scholars 
are not always strong teachers. This tendency is well

illustrated by an interesting passage in the sketch of 
Professor Pierce, perhaps the greatest mathematical 
genius our country has produced, found in Dr. A. P. 
Peabody’s pleasant volume entitled Harvard Reminis- 
cences. The two men were at one time charged with 
teaching all the mathematics then taught in Harvard 
College, and alternated in some of the classes. Peabody 
says he was in one respect Pierce’s superior because he 
was in other respects so much his inferior, 
“No one was more cordially ready than he to give such help as he 
could; but his intuition of the whole ground was so keen and compre-

pupils could have done, I, therefore, knew every short step of the 
way that they would be obliged to take, and could lead them in the 
very footsteps which I had just trodden before them.” 1

  CHAPTER XII. 
ATTENTION: ITS NATURE, KINDS, AND VALUE. 
THERE have been writers who maintained that atten. 
tion is a special faculty of the mind, like perception, 
he Generat Memory, or imagination. None, that I am 
Senseof aware of, now hold that view, but all regard 
Attention. attention rather as a state or condition of 
mind in which any one of the intellectual faculties may 
manifest itself. It is a predominant intellectual state. 
In a broad sense every act of consciousness is an act of 
attention ; you attend to the object that you know, al- 
Petits though you may know it feebly, as compared 
of Con- with the object that you do not know and so 
sciousness. 4 not attend to; but this is not the com- 
mon acceptation of the word. Usage limits it rather to 
acts of knowing that have a certain character or possess 
a certain quality. Attention is a narrower term than 
knowledge or consciousness; we know things, or are 
conscious of things, to which we do not give attention 
in the accepted sense of the word. 
The matter may be put in another way. Conscious- 
ness is a name that we give to all states of mind, or to 
all mental operations. It is seen in two forms — diffused 
consciousness and concentrated consciousness, the second 
being what we cali attention. Messrs. Dexter and Garlick 
present the simple facts in this way:

“ (a) Suppose I am looking at a small object by artificial light. 1 
cannot see it distinctly. I interpose a lens between my eye and the 
object. The light is concentrated on the object and I see it dis- 
tinctly. Now consczousness, like light, seems to increase in vividness 
in proportion as tt zs concentrated on one spot.

“(b) Two boys are talking in an undertone in the class. The 
teacher is dimly conscious of a ‘ noise’ in the room; he thinks there 
is a noise, but is not certain. He begins to listen, to concentrate his 
mind, as it were, upon the supposed sound. He identifies it as a sound 
of conversation, and localizes the sound as coming from the two boys 
who are talking. The boys are talking no louder at the conclusion 
than at the beginning of the incident, but the teacher has by his act 
of attention given greater distinctness and vividness to his conscious- 
ness.”’+ 
Attention, then, involves energetic or intensive know- 
ing, and it results from fixing some measure of mental 
Attention POWer upon one object or a small group of ob- 
Iuustrated. jects, and withholding it from the other objects 
in the field of consciousness. Thus, as I ride along the 
road I notice a flock of sheep and a herd of horses in the 
field; my mental state is one of diffused consciousness. 
But I may attend to the horses alone, allowing the sheep 
to fall largely or wholly out of my mind, and vice versa ; 
or I may attend to some one particular horse or sheep 
that captures my eye, to the partial or total exclusion of 
all the others, and of all competing objects of knowledge. 
Accordingly, attention is a selective act of the mind, one 
or more objects being chosen for intensive knowing to 
the exclusion of the others. It involves abstraction, that

is, the withdrawing of mental power from certain objects 
to fix it upon one or a small number of others. 
The word “attention” is derived from the Latin ad, 
meaning “to,” and ¢endere, meaning “ to stretch,” and so 
Bi acioey. has the etymological meaning of stretching to 
of“ atten- something. Tension, which means primarily 
pon a strain upon some material thing, as a rope or 
a muscle, comes from the same Latin verb. Thus atten- 
tion shows us, in a figure, the mind in a state of tension or 
strain, similar to that placed upon the rope or muscle. 
Moreover, the strain that comes upon the mind in atten- 
tion is often, if not commonly, accompanied by a similar 
physical experience. 
The external signs of attention are not to be mistaken. 
Thus, in certain forms of attention, the eyes, the ears, the 
External @tms sometimes, the whole body perhaps, 
Signs of “converge” towards their object, “ all motions 
Attention, are arrested; ” “our personality is captured,” 
that is, all the tendencies of the individual, all his avail- 
able energy, aims at the same point. Again, it has been 
remarked that in extreme cases the mouth opens wide, 
while in children and in many adults close attention 
produces protrusion of the lips, a kind of pouting. The 
word “tension” no doubt passed from the material into 
the mental sphere because of a supposed resemblance be- 
tween the bodily and the mental states. 
Still other similitudes are employed to explain the 
nature of attention. One of the most common, as well 
machen sen of the most effective, is that of the lens. 
the Lens of “Attention is to consciousness what contrac- 
the Mind. tion of the pupil is to light,” says Sir William 
Hamilton; “ or to the eye of the mind what the microscope 
is to the bodily eye.” Professor Dewey speaks to the
-P-A-G-E-108
  108 THE ART OF STUDY. 
same effect. “In attention we focus the mind, as the 
lens takes all the light coming to it, and, instead of al- 
lowing it to diffuse itself evenly, concentrates it in a point 
of great light and heat.” 
The action of the mind in attention may also be likened 
to the action of the machine used in the laboratory to 
Attention a COndense air, or to produce high degrees of 
Condensing atmospheric pressure. A pressure of fifteen 
a pounds on the square inch, which is normal, 
is called one atmosphere; multiples, as thirty pounds and 
forty-five pounds, are called two and three atmospheres, 
etc. So we might by analogy speak of one or more at- 
mospheres of consciousness or of knowing power. 
Attention presents to our view many interesting phases. 
For one thing, it is difficult to know when it begins 
Rgegiiing and when it ends, so insensible is the transition 
and End of from the ordinary state of consciousness to at- 
eesatlon, tention, and again from attention to the ordi- 
nary state of consciousness. “It embraces all degrees, 
from the transient instant accorded to the buzzing of a fly 
to the state of complete absorption.” 
Another interesting question is, To how many things 
can the mind attend at once? But this is of little interest 
for us here, because it is well known that effective study 
demands as close a limitation of the mind to the objects 
of study as possible. 
Again, it is important to remark that attention is not 
limited to external or material objects, but relates to 
xtendsto Mental objects as well. It is just as easy, or 
Internal even more so, to attend to a man’s thoughts or 
pees: feelings provided he gives expression to them, 
as it isto attend to his attire or bodily actions. Then, 
Ican attend to my own unexpressed thoughts and feelings

      ATTENTION. 109 
in consciousness, and am often compelled to attend to 
them to the exclusion of external objects. 
Furthermore, attention may take the direction of any 
cognitive faculty, as perception, memory, or thought. 
May Take <\ttentive perception is energetic perception ; 
the Direc- attentive memory, energetic memory ; attentive 
Ree reflection, energetic reflection. The effects of 
Faculty. attention are well known; they give a fuller 
and better knowledge of the object than the diffused con- 
sciousness. My ordinary observation of a horse, for ex- 
ample, gives me a general idea of the horse, my attentive 
observation gives me a minute and thorough knowledge ; 
and so of the other kinds of attention. 
We have seen that attention involves the fixing of the 
mind upon some object or objects, or that it is the con- 
centration of the mind upon such object or 
objects. But this is not all; the element of 
time enters into the activity. Attention, as 
commonly understood, involves, not merely the fixing of 
the mind upon an object, but also the holding of it upon 
this object. The second element is as important as the 
first one. We may go back to the similitude of the lens: 
to be effective, the glass must be constructed so that it 
will focalize the rays of light and heat, and must then 
be held in one position long enough to make this focal 
point a burning point. The most powerful burning 
glass will not set gunpowder on fire if it is kept in active 
motion, while an instrument of much inferior power will 
ignite substances not accounted inflammable if it is 
held steadily in one place. 
As there are two states or kinds of consciousness, so 
there are two kinds of attention. The distinction be- 
tween them refers to the effort involved in the act. Continued 
Attention. 
   
-P-A-G-E-110
  110 THE ART OF STUDY. 
Some acts of attention are not marked by conscious 
effort; other acts are so marked, and sometimes very 
Passive ana Strongly. Attention shown in the first class 
Active At- of cases is called passive; that shown in the 
peugeot. second class, active. The first kind is also 
known as reflex, spontaneous, automatic, and involuntary 
attention; the second as voluntary or volitional attention. 
The central fact is this: in passive attention the will is not 
present, while in active attention it is always present, and 
often ina very energetic form. But we must take a closer 
view of the subject. 
In passive attention some object is present to the mind 
that draws to itself the mind’s energy or power. Another 
way to state the same thing is to say that 
this object attracts the mind; and still an- 
other that it controls or commands the at- 
tention. The word “attract” used in this connection 
suggests a familiar fact which has perhaps prompted its 
use. If you bring a magnet within a certain distance of 
a bit of iron or steel that is free to move, it attracts the 
metal to itself and holds it in its own grasp. In passive 
attention the object may come into the mind’s way inci- 
dentally, or it may be thrown into its way intentionally by 
some outside cause; it does not matter so long as the 
object chooses the mind or attracts it. Still further, the 
object may be an external or an internal one; it may be 
the discharge of a cannon or the mental image of some 
absent friend; but, whether the object be external or in- 
ternal, it makes no difference so long as it holds the mind 
in its own firm embrace. 
In active attention, on the other hand, the mind itself 
selects the object of knowledge and holds it captive. 
There is an act of choice or volition. In other words, Passive 
Attention. 
 
-P-A-G-E-111
ATTENTION, IIt 
this act of selection proceeds from the will, and this fact 
gives to this species of attention its name, 
voluntary. As before, the object may be 
external or internal, but the act is voluntary 
if it proceeds directly from choice. 
A French writer has said that passive or reflex atten- 
tion makes the child seem to belong less to himself than 
to every object which happens to catch his 
notice. But active or voluntary attention 
makes the object the mind's own possession. 
The impulse in the one case is from without inward, in 
the other case from within outward. The two kinds of 
movement may be likened to the impulses that move on 
the afferent and the efferent nerves, the first running from 
the surface of the body to the brain, the second from the 
brain to the surface of the body. Active

of Impulse. 
It is apparent, therefore, that, while passive attention is 
spontaneous, active attention springs from cultivation. 
Rea Dr. Preyer points out that, in the earliest period 
Attention —_ of its life, the child is capable of spontaneous 
Cultivated: attention only; it fixes its gaze upon shin- 
ing objects and upon the faces of its mother or nurse ; 
and it is only about the end of the third month that it 
explores its field of vision more fully and by degrees rests 
its eyes upon objects that are less interesting. Volitional 
attention comes much later. Ribot remarks that it 
“originates of necessity, under the pressure of need, and 
with the progress of intelligence. It is an instrument 
that has been perfected,—a product of civilization.” 
What Ribot says of attention asa whole, viz., that it 
“supposes the existence of a master idea drawing to it- 
self all that relates to it and nothing else, allowing solici- 
tations to produce themselves only within very narrow 
 
-P-A-G-E-112

limits, and on condition that they converge toward a 
common point,” is more particularly true of passive 
attention. 
The high value of attention, its necessity to high attain. 
ments of any kind, above all, its relations to study and 
education, both as a cause of success in the 
student, and again as an object to be sought 
after in discipline—these things flow from the 
very nature of the act. Sir William Hamilton has dis- 
cussed this branch of the subject with great ability, pre- 
senting many interesting historical examples of what 
attention may accomplish, It will be well worth our 
while to transcribe a portion of his discussion. The Value 
of Attention. 
“The difference between an ordinary mind and the mind of a New- 
ton consists principally in this, that the one is capable of the applica~ 
tion of a more continuous attention than the other,—that 
Se ton a Newton is able without fatigue to connect inference 
‘Attention. With inference in one long series towards a determinate 
end; while the man of inferior capacity is soon obliged 
to break or let fall the thread which he had begun to spin. This is, 
in fact, what Sir Isaac, with equal modesty and shrewdness, himself 
admitted. To one who complimented him on his genius he replied 
that, if he had made any discoveries, it was owing more to patient at- 
tention than to any other talent. There is but little analogy between 
mathematics and play-acting; but I heard the great Mrs. Siddons, 
in nearly the same language, attribute the whole superiority of her 
unrivaled talent to the more intense study which she bestowed upon 
her parts. If what Alcibiades, in the Symposzum of Plato, narrates of 
Socrates were true, the father of Greek philosophy must have pos- 
sessed this faculty of meditation or continuous attention in the highest 
degree. The story, indeed, has some appearance of exaggeration ; 
but it shows what Alcibiades, or rather Plato through him, deemed 
the requisite of a great thinker. According to this report, in a mili- 
tary expedition which Socrates made along with Alcibiades, the phi- 
losopher was seen by the Athenian army to stand for a whole day and 
 
-P-A-G-E-113
ATTENTION. 113 
a night, until the breaking of the second morning, motionless with a 
fixed gaze,—thus showing that he was uninterruptedly engrossed with 
the consideration of a single subject.’ ‘And thus,’ says Alcibiades, 
‘Socrates is ever wont to do when his mind is occupied with inquiries 
in which there are difficulties to be overcome. He then never inter~ 
rupts his meditation, and forgets to eat, and drink, and sleep,—every- 
thing, in short, until his inquiry has reached its termination, or, at 
least, until he has seen some light in it.” In this history there may 
be, as I have said, exaggeration; but still the truth of the principle 
is undeniable... . 
“These examples and authorities concur in establishing the im- 
portant truth, that he who would, with success, attempt discovery, 
either by inquiry into the works of nature, or by meditation on the 
phenomena of mind, must acquire the faculty of abstracting him- 
self, for a season, from the invasion of surrounding objects ; must be 
able even, in a certain degree, to emancipate himself from the dominion 
of the body, and live, as it were, a pure intelligence, within the circle of 
his thoughts. This faculty has been manifested, more or less, by all 
whose names are associated with the progress of the intellectual 
sciences. In some, indeed, the power of abstraction almost degener- 
ated into a habit akin to disease, and the examples which now occur 
to me would almost induce me to retract what I have said about the 
exaggeration of Plato’s history of Socrates, 
“ Archimedes, it is well known, was so absorbed in a geometrical 
meditation that he was first aware of the storming of Syracuse by his 
own death-wound, and his exclamation on the entrance of Roman 
soldiers was— Noli turbare circulos meos. In like manner, Joseph 
Scaliger, the most learned of men, when a Protestant student in Paris, 
was so engrossed in the study of Homer, that he became aware of the 
massacre of St. Bartholomew, and of his own escape, only on the day 
subsequent to the catastrophe. The philosopher Carneades was 
habitually liable to fits of meditation, so profound, that, to prevent him 
from sinking from inanition, his maid found it necessary to feed him like 
a child. And it is reported of Newton that, while engaged in his 
mathematical researches, he sometimes forgot to dine. Cardan, one 
of the most illustrious of philosophers and mathematicians, was once, 
upon a journey, so lost in thought, that he forgot both his way and 
the object of his journey. To the questions of his driver whither he 
should proceed, he made no answer ; and, when he came to himself at

nightfall, he was surprised to find the carriage at a standstill, and di- 
rectly under a gallows. The mathematician Vieta was sometimes so 
buried in meditation that for hours he bore more resemblance to a 
dead person than to a living, and was then wholly unconscious of 
everything going on around him. On the day of his marriage the 
great Budzeus forgot everything in philological speculations, and he 
was only awakened to the affairs of the external world by a tardy em- 
bassy from the marriage party, who found him absorbed in the com- 
position of his Commentaréz. 
“Tt is beautifully observed by Malebranche, ‘that the discovery of 
truth can only be made by the labor of attention ; because it is only 
the labor of attention which has light for its reward’; and in another 
place: ‘The attention of the intellect is a natural prayer by which we 
obtain the enlightenment of reason.’ ”? 
Dr. W. B. Carpenter relates that John Stuart Mill 
thought out, or mentally composed, much of his great 
Jonn Stuart WOrk on Logic while walking between his lodg- 
Mill. ings in London and the India House, picking 
his way through the crowded thoroughfares, so unmind- 
ful of what was going on about him that he even failed 
to notice his familiar acquaintances who chanced to meet 
him in the throng of passengers. 
‘The terms “absent-minded” and ‘“ absent-mindedness,” 
are often used in connection with such facts as are 
related in the stories told of Socrates and Absent- : 7 
Mindedness Mr. Mill. The implication is that the mind 
fea nnn OF the person thus employed has in some way 
escaped from him—is absent, in a word. This 
is just as you look at it; the fact is that his mind is 
absent from the things right about him because it is ab- 
sorbed in things of another description. Ribot applies to 
this state of mind the word “distraction.” “Thus there 
are people,” he says, “ who, wholly absorbed by some idea,

1868, Lecture XIV.  
-P-A-G-E-115
ATTENTION. 115 
are also really distracted in regard to what takes place 
around them; they afford no hold to external events, 
and allow the latter to flit by them without penetrating 
their mind. Such people appear incapable of attention 
for the very reason that they are very attentive.”’! 
The effects of attention and absorption of mind are by 
no means confined to the mental sphere; on the con- 
trary some of the most striking of such effects 
peerateal relate to the body. For example, it is well 
tention. known that mental preoccupation will deaden 
for the time physical pain. A public speaker, 
becoming interested in his theme, forgets the toothache 
or rheumatism that was torturing him when he began 
his discourse, and that is sure to return, perhaps with re- 
doubled effect, when he has finished speaking. A boy 
who is eagerly pursuing a rabbit, or playing ball, does not 
notice at the time the severe cut or bruise that he has 
received on his bare foot from a pointed stick or a sharp- 
edged stone; while soldiers in the heat of battle do not 
always become immediately sensible of the wounds that 
they have received. It is well known, also, that bodily 
ailments, even severe ailments, may be brought on by 
thinking intently, long, and often, of some particular part 
of the body. “In this way it often happens,” says Dr. 
Carpenter, “ that a vea/ malady supervenes upon the fancied 
ailments of those in whom the want of helpful occupa- 
tion for the mind leaves it free to dwell upon its mere 
sensations; whilst, on the other hand, the strong expecta- 
tion of benefit from a particular mode of treatment will 
often cure diseases that involve serious organic change.” ?

    CHAPTER XIII. 
PASSIVE ATTENTION: INTEREST. 
Tue last chapter was devoted to defining attention, 
discriminating its kinds, and marking out its scope and 
Recapitu- value. More definitely, we saw that attention 
lation. is the act of the mind when concentrated or 
focused on some particular thing or subject ; that there 
are two kinds of attention, passive and active, and that 
they sometimes assume forms of great energy. We also 
remarked the place that attention holds in the mental life. 
We must not suppose, however, that the value of atten- 
tion is limited to intellectual pursuits ;it extends to the 
vatue of at- Whole practical world as well. In fact, it is no 
tentionin exaggeration to say that a man’s power of at- 
Bducation. + ention often determines his success or failure in 
life, involving his ability to use effectively his powers, 
both of mind and body. It is, therefore, obvious that 
the cultivation of the child’s attention is a matter of 
prime importance in the conduct of his education, and 
that the subject needs careful study. We shall deal first, 
in two chapters, with passive attention, and afterwards, in 
two more, with active. 
There are some elementary facts relating to the subject 
that should be dealt with before we take up the practical 
117  
-P-A-G-E-118
- of Attention 
  118 THE ART OF STUDY. 
question of the development or cultivation of the passive 
attention. - 
1. The first of these facts is that the earliest acts of at- 
tention on the part of the child are reflex or passive acts. 
Miaig As is well known, the human infant is born 
First Acts blind, but he gradually acquires sight and the 
world of vision is slowly opened to him. At 
first this world, or the very small portion of it 
that comes within his range, floats before him vague and 
indefinite; but ere long he begins to notice particular 
things, or they begin to arrest his mind. “At a very 
early age indeed,” says M. Compayré, “ there are moments 
of keen consciousness when all the intelligence the child 
possesses is concentrated on one point, when he is fasci- 
nated, for instance, by a light or bright color. The ex- 
ternal signs of attention show themselves then: the eye 
is fixed; the child is motionless, plunged into a sort of 
stupor of ecstasy.”! He may be fascinated also by 
sounds as well as sights. Wehave a report of a girl three 
months old who was attentive to all about her, even to 
the very noise of a step on the floor; and another of a 
boy who, when a month old, noticed the gestures of those 
that spoke to him and was perceptibly influenced by their 
words. These simple acts of attention are the beginnings 
of that power to focus the mind which reaches its fully 
developed form in such examples as those narrated in the 
last chapter. But they are distinctly reflex ; at this stage 
of life the child has no will that can focus his mind or 
perform any similar act: his mind is focused from with- 
out and not from within; and this continues to be the 
case for a considerable period. Passive.

2. It is clear that in passive attention the object has 
some peculiar attraction for the mind or some peculiar influ- 
lees. once oven it. “Fascination” is M. Compayré’s 
nation.” word. For example, asa pupil in school is 
fee %b- toiling away at his arithmetic, a brass band that 
is passing on the street’ suddenly strikes up 
a tune, and his attention at once forsakes his lesson 
and follows the music{ Under the circumstances the 
boy brings his mind back to the arithmetic only with 
great difficulty, if at all. Indeed, it may be with dif- 
ficulty that he resists the impulse to leave his seat 
and rush to the window to see the band. It is evident, 
therefore, that there is something for the boy’s mind in 
the music that is not in the arithmetic. Now what is this 
something? We have for this question no better answer 
than that the band is interesting, while the arithmetic is 
not, or that the band is more interesting than the arith- 
metic. The question why the one is more interesting 
than the other, we shall for the present postpone. 
3. It is also well known that objects which attract the 
attention of some minds do not attract the attention 
of others, or do not attract them with equal 
pene! strength. In other words, what is interesting 
to one person is not necessarily interesting, or 
/equally interesting, to another person. Much depends upon 
age, association, individual pursuits, range of experience, 
individual temperament, and a variety of other circum- 
stances. What takes the attention of a child may not 
take the attention of a man; what takes the attention of 
a boy may not take the attention of a girl, and so on. 
The teacher of the school referred to above will probably 
be less interested in the band than the school children, or 
his interest may be of a wholly different kind, relative

120 THE ART OF STUDY. 
to keeping school in order. Again, what takes one child’s 
attention may not take another’s. One child in a clover 
field will run after the blossoms, another after the butter- 
flies. A dozen persons, we will suppose, look out of the 
windows of the same railway car as it moves from station 
to station across the country; the same panorama passes 
before the eyes of all of them; they all form a general 
picture or idea of this panorama, perhaps, but even if so, 
they do not see—that is, give attention to—the same things. 
One attends to the forests and fields, a second to the 
growing crops, a third to the vehicles and people on the 
roads, a fourth to the animals in the fields, while a fifth 
observes two or more of these groups of objects. The 
explanation of such familiar facts as these is easy : these 
persons do not, generally speaking, consciously select the 
objects that they particularly observe, but follow their in- 
terests, which differ one from another; that is, their atten- 
tion is reflex. Again, a dozen persons reading the same 
newspaper will be impressed, perhaps, by some of the same 
| things, because they have some interests in common, but 
| beyond this there is great diversity,—one attends to the 
fashion pictures, another to the reports of games, and still 
another to the market reports. Here, however, the will 
is likely to play a part, as indeed it may in the case of the 
railway passengers, different persons selecting different 
things. 
4. Equally well known is the fact that an object which 
is attractive to a child or a man at one time is not attract- 
Time ana ive to him at another time. Here, too, much 
eeeee: depends upon circumstances. There are, per- 
haps, no absolutely persistent interests. A child is not in- 
terested in his picture-book, or a man in his newspaper, if 
he is very sick. Ordinarily a man may not closely observe 
 
-P-A-G-E-121
  PASSIVE ATTENTION: INTEREST. 121 
the carriages that roll along the street, but he will be likely 
to do so if he is about to purchase one himself. A band 
playing in the park of a great city may not even be heard 
by thousands of people, but it would be pretty sure to 
attract them if they were ona country road. Then, some 
objects are more attractive at one time than another. The 
boy in school forgets for a moment his arithmetic in 
the presence of the band, but if his mother, whom he has 
not seen fora year, were at the same moment to enter 
the schoolroom, he would probably not even notice the 
band in joy at seeing her. Still another important ob- 
servation is that objects change in their attractiveness 
with the passage of time, some becoming more and 
some less interesting. The characteristic interests of 
childhood are very different from the characteristic in- 
terests of manhood, and vice versa. Tops, marbles, and 
hoops please us when we see them in the hands of chil- 
dren, but in the hands of men they are ridiculous. 
The interest that attaches to language is often alto-

But it is well known that the tongues of dying men often 
move automatically and convey no real meaning. Interest 
is therefore no measure of value.

  122 THE ART OF STUDY. 
' The question has been asked why certain objects attract 
the minds of children in greater or less degree, while 
others do not. The answer has been given that 
the attractive objects are interesting to children 
while the unattractive are not interesting. This brings 
the subject of interest fully before us. No better defini- 
tion can be given than the one furnished by Dexter and 
Garlick. ‘Interest is the name given to the pleasurable 
or painful feelings which are evoked by an object or idea, 
and which give that object or idea the power of arousing 
and holding the attention.” These authors quote another 
writer to this effect: “ Whatever does not interest the 
‘mind, that the mind is indifferent to, and whatever it is 
indifferent to is to that mind as if it had no existence.”’} 
But why are |some objects or ideas more interesting 
than others? This question cannot be answered in any

Interest. — Calls wonder the mother of knowledge ; other 
writers speak of novelty, curiosity, and astonishment, 
much in the same way; while M. Compayré, seeking the 
causes that turn the child’s mind from one object to an- 
other, writes: Interest. 
“ The first is the novelty of impressions, for novelty renders impres- 
sions more intense. | As a general rule, anything that is presented to 
, _ the child for the first time will captivate him and occupy 
por cit. him for several moments at least. Astonishment, the 
surprise which every unexpected appearance causes, are 
attentive states.” 
Still other stimuli, he says, are the different emotions 
that the child is capable of feeling. He mentions

“ The agreeable emotions; above all, those that naturally captivate 
the senses, because the desire for pleasure is satisfied; for instance, 
all that tickles the appetite of hunger or of thirst ; later, all that calls 
forth sympathy and affection. But the disagreeable emotions, too, 
are, to a certain extent, the starting point of the attentive emotions.” 
This is all very true; novelty, for example, is a source 
of interest. The family horse may not attract much at- 
tention in the pasture or stable, but he cer- 
pence tainly will become interesting if he finds his

ing the difficulty one step farther back. The 
question comes up at once, Why the novel or unexpected, * 
why wonder or astonishment, is a source of interest ? and 
we cannot give any final answer; we only know that it is 
so. 
It is quite clear, then, that passive attention is a feature 
of great interest or value in human life. What are the 
things that interest us? What are the objects, external 
or internal, that steal away our minds and hold them cap- 
tive? Upon this question, in no small degree, do indi- 
vidual usefulness and happiness depend. Let us follow 
the topic a little farther.

state. No mind can be strained continuously without 
Mecads serious consequences. Every attentive state

Essential to not suffice; our well-being, our very safety or 
eucccee: life, depends upon the mental bein , dep p le powers ig 
thoroughly aroused; and in such cases we must give 
heed, or pay attention, to what concerns us. Many of 
the most serious interests of life fall into this class of ob- 
jects. Mere drifting, mere living, never made a success- 
ful man in the proper sense of that term. Action—wise, 
well-directed action—is the key to success. Other things 
being equal, or greatly unequal, for that matter, men are 
successful in the work of their hands or minds in the 
ratio of the serious attention that they give to such work. 
But the attention that is so essential to success need 
not be, and cannot be, all voluntary attention. In the 
first place, if the will must exert itself every All Atten- F : 
tion Cannot time an act of attention is called for, the 
pee mind will soon tire out, because the vigorous 
action of the will is an operation that involves 
much waste of nerve and brain force. The reflex, or au- 
tomatic, acts of the mind are easier, and, so to speak, 
cheaper than the voluntary acts. Again, the reflex activ- 
ities of the mind are always swifter and sometimes more 
vigorous than the voluntary activities. Accordingly, re- 
flex attention appears in the common and necessary func- 
tions when ease and promptness of action are necessary. 
It appears also in emergencies. Thus a man attends to 
his toilet on arising in the morning without formally will- 
ing to do; or, ashe walks along the street, he mechan- 
ically dodges a shower of bricks and mortar when a work- 
man on a scaffold above him cries out, “Stand from

CHAPTER “XivV. 
THE CULTIVATION OF PASSIVE ATTENTION. 
WE meet at the threshold of our inquiry the law that 
runs through all mental cultivation and growth,—the law 
Mental Ac- of activity. The mental faculties, in other tivity the - A . Taw of words, increase through appropriate action. 
Growth. The activity of one faculty may strengthen 
a second and a third faculty, but the rule is that the 
faculties are most invigorated by their own specific ex- 
ercise. While the mental faculties are in no sense sepa- 
rate and distinct, but are all the manifestations of the same 
mind, it is still true that perception grows mainly through 
perception, thought through thinking, memory through 
remembering, etc. At most, an inactive mind, in respect 
to volume and power, either remains stationary or loses 
power. Attention is not, indeed, a mental faculty in the 
sense that perception or memory is, but it is the ener- 
getic activity of any faculty, and so is subject to the gen- 
eral law of growth. Indeed, the growth of the faculties 
consists very largely in the increase of this very power of 
attention. Attention becomes strong through attending 
to things; a habit is formed and habit makes activity 
quick and easy. This is the case with passive and active 
attention alike. 
127 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
128 THE ART OF STUDY. 
Coming to reflex attention, the first fact to be stated 
is that the mind responds to objects in the ratio of their 
interest or attractiveness ; the more attractive or interest- 
ing the object, the quicker and fuller the response will be. 
From this very familiar fact are derived several important 
rules of teaching. 
One of these rules is that, at first, the objects or lessons 
to be taught to a child should be chosen with reference to 
tepake the his interests. Advantage should be taken of 
Child where such preparation for instruction as he has ak 
pe ready received. “ Take the child where he is,” 
must be the teacher’s sole motto but only at first, for at a 
later stage this rule must, in some measure at least, 
be set aside. 
~ A second rule is that, if the child does not respond, 
readily enough to the object or lesson, the teacher 
_ must contrive in some way to make it more 
Fete attractive. Printed language, oral explana- 
teresting, tion, real objects, pictures or other graphic 
forms of illustration, offer him a large range 
in respect to modes of presentation. Moreover, there 
is an equal range in respect to the combination of facts 
and ideas; old ideas reénforce new ones, and new ideas 
give life and energy to old ones. One test, and a very 
high test, of the teacher's ability is his skill in making 
his instruction attractive. 
_A third rule is that the teacher should take advantage 
‘of favoring times and circumstances in the selection and 
presentation of teaching material. It is well 
zimes and known that instruction which would be rejected 
at one time will be welcomed at another time. 
This is but another way of saying that the instruction 
that will make little or no impression under some cir- 
 
-P-A-G-E-129
  CULTIVATION OF PASSIVE ATTENTION. 129 
cumstances will make a deep and lasting impression under 
other circumstances. The teacher, like other people, 
should strike while the iron is hot. This important rule 
has numerous applications. 
A fourth rule springs from the fact that the interest of 
the pupil in a subject depends in some degree upon the 
hour of the day when it is presented.  Fresh- 
ness of mind, which is often only freshness of 
body, is to be considered.( As a rule, the 
heavier school subjects should come in the earlier part of 
the day. Then, special instruction should be made to 
harmonize, to a great extent, with the passing occurrences 
of interest, either of the school or the larger world. A 
dispatch in the morning’s newspaper will often make the 
pupils eager for a particular lesson in geography or his- 
tory, civics or literature. When the body of the late 
President Faure lay in state at the Elysée in Paris, and 
the election of his successor was impending, the time 
was evidently opportune for teaching the proper pupils in 
the school the leading facts relative to the election of the 
president of the French Republic. A good time to give 
some special instruction in the geography of Cuba would 
have been when our army and fleet were carrying on war 
against the Spaniards in that island. Good teachers are 
always on the outlook for these opportune times and 
seasons. The value of moral instruction, in particular, de- 
pends almost wholly on its opportuneness, or on the im- 
mediate preparation of the pupils to receive it. z 
A fifth rule is that if the teacher cannot after a suf. 
ficient trial make a subject interesting to a child, he 
Dropping should drop it, at least for the time. This as.

petent one and that the pupil will continue in his care.

  130 THE ART OF STUDY. 
No doubt this rule is a difficult one to apply judiciously, 
and we shall soon have occasion to refer to it again. 
It will be said no doubt that school instruction, to be 
valuable, must be systematic, that there must be a pro- 
gramme, and that the number, kind, and order The School p e 
Programme. Of the exercises cannot be determined by the 
mental states or affections of the children. 
This is perfectly true and should never be lost sight of. 
Haphazard, go-as-you-please teaching is necessarily poor 
teaching; instruction must conform to a general order. 
But this is a very different thing from denying the teacher 
the right to study the moods and tenses of his pupils, and 
to adapt the work of the school to them, within reasonable 
limits. The programme should never be allowed to be- 
come tyrannous, which it does when it is followed with- 
out variableness or shadow of turning. The teacher is, 
in general, the leader of the school, and not the school 
of the teacher. He is not passively to follow the whims 
and caprices of the pupils, or even their more lasting and 
secondary interests. He is rather to create interests, to 
control states of mind, to lead his flock; but this by no 
means implies that his regimen shall be fixed or arbitrary ; 
it rather implies close observation of the minds of pupils 
and the adjustment of the instruction and discipline to 
them. There is a sense in which every one who leads 
must follow. Moreover, these remarks are particularly 
important in primary schools, where pupils have little 
power of self-regulation. 
The course of study, if a good one, conforms in a gen- 
eral way to the rule that advantage shall be taken of 
the Course favoring times and tides in arranging instruc-

should be used for specific purposes, as memory lessons

for the memory, observation lessons for the perceptive 
faculties, and so on, has been greatly overdone, since any 
good lesson reaches more than one faculty of mind; at 
the same time certain subjects are adapted to certain 
kinds and stages of mental development. Nature lessons 
and historical tales are presented to the child when his 
faculties of observation and imagination are quick and 
active, and his curiosity is alert; while lessons of a more 
abstract character, as grammar and theoretical arithmetic, 
are held in reserve until his powers of reflection are more 
fully developed. ‘ 
*Theré are still other important facts relating to our 
subject that we must not fail to consider. In itself, in- 
terest isa very changeful thing, as all practical psycholo- 
gists know; nor is it possible to understand it even meas- 
urably without indulging in some analysis—-going behind 
the abstraction called “interest” to consider concrete 
interests. 
There are two ways in whichinterests may be divided 
—with reference to the extent of their prevalence, and 
mwo-Waya with respect to the time of their continuance. 
of Dividing Divided in the first way, interests are general 
Interests. and individual; divided in the second way, they 
are permanent and temporary. 
General interests are those that belong to all normal 
minds at some stage of their development. Desire for 
General knowledge, love of old things, interest in new 
Interests. things, and particularly interest in the junction 
of the new and the old—these are universal facts. These 
general interests vary greatly in strength and in the par- 
ticular direction which they take, but they belong, never- 
theless, tothe human mind. Unless the desire for knowl- 
edge is universal, universal education is a vain hope, 
   
-P-A-G-E-132
  132 THE ART OF STUDY. 
Again, there are certain kinds of knowledge that are of 
general interest ; no normal mind, for example, is indif- 
ferent to what immediately concerns itself. 
Individual interests are those that belong to particular 
persons. All minds are not interested in knowing the 
Individual same things, nor are all minds responsive to the 
Interests. same kinds of novelty. Every schoolmaster has 
his repertoire of illustrative examples. Sir Walter Scott 
took little interest in the regulation studies of the high 
school at Edinburgh, but was absorbed in the history, 
antiquities, and legends of Scotland. Sir Humphry 
Davy cared little for the studies of the school, and was 
accounted dull, but he became a great chemist. Charles 
Darwin was not interested in the work of the school that 
he attended, and got little out of it, as he said, except the 
knowledge of chemistry that he taught himself by private 
experiments. “St, Bernard,” says Dean Farrar, “is so 
dead to outer impressions that he travels all day along 
Lake Geneva, and then asks where the lake is; while 
Linnzus is so sensitive to the beauties of Nature that, 
when he beholds a promontory standing boldly forth 
and teeming with beauty, he can not help falling upon 
his knees and thanking God for such a world.” 
Permanent interests are either inherited, and so belong 
to the original *character, or they originate in early habit, 
Permanent and so constitute a part of second nature. De- 
Interests. sire for knowledge in some form, love of novelty 
of some kind, are permanent interests. So, desire for 
particular kinds of knowledge, as of animals or plants, or 
particular species of animals or plants, may be permanent. 
Temporary interests arise from a variety of causes. 
Some of them continue for a considerable time,» while 
others are wholly fleeting and transient. They do not,

Eneee fore: reflect, as permanent interests do, the real char-

Interests. but indicate only the stage of growth, or mental 
moods dependent upon bodily conditions or upon environ- 
ment. ( Relatively, the interests of adults, as a whole, are 
far more permanent than the interests of children and 
youth) This is owing to the solidifying of the character, 
the development of the power of internal control, and the 
elimination of miscellaneous activities from the mental life. 
The distinctions that have now been made, while often 
overlooked or undervalued, are of the utmost conse- 
quence in education; since to treat individual interests 
as though they were universal, and temporary ones as 
though they were permanent, or vice versa, must lead to 
serious evils if persisted in. 
Environment is of two kinds, natural and moral, and 
both affect most profoundly our interests, and through 
Influence Our interests our character. The immeasurable 
of Nature. effect of these environments is largely summed 
up in the word “ imitation,” which is partly unconscious 
and partly conscious; the first being a kind of silent ab- 
sorption or assimilation, the second a process of purpose- 
ful copying. (As is well known,(a child’s two environ.

feelings, and practices of the home and the school. Such 
adaptation comes from imitation, which lies so near the  
-P-A-G-E-134
134 THE ART OF STUDY. 
root of civilization itself. \For instance, children breaight 
up in families where, on Sunday morning, it isnever asked 
whether the members of the family who are old enough 
will go to church, but it is silently assumed that they will 
go and the assumption acted upon, naturally fall into 
the habit of chureh going themselves, commonly with in- 
terest, or at least without resistance. It is the same way 
with attendance upon the school. Under favorable condi- 
tions children show little of that distaste for school of which 
so much is sometimes heard. With respect to both 
church going and school attendance, different parents 
give very different accounts. Nor is the fact acciden- 
tal orwholly due to the inherited interests of children; 
it is largely due rather to the regimen and atmosphere 
of the home. In other words, much of the current dis- 
inclination for church and school is purely artificial, and 
in no sense a permanent interest, unless it is made per- 
manent by habit. 
We may go much further. Children who grow up ex- 
pecting to find interest in their books and studies com- 
Homeana monly find it, while children who fail to find. 
School. interest are often prepared for the failure by 
the habitual tone of the home or the school, or both. 
So-called interests are marked by the artificiality men- 
tioned in the last paragraph. It is significant how much 
more trouble some parents and teachers have with the 
studies of their children or pupils than others. Sometimes 
the familiar tone of the home, or it may be of the school 
itself, tends to engender whims and notions in the heads 
of pupils. Sometimes the direct suggestion comes from 
parent or teacher that the child will not find isuch or 
such a study interesting, or that he cannot master it, 
when in fact he has made no real effort to find it interest. 
 
-P-A-G-E-135
CULTIVATION OF PASSIVE ATTENTION. 135 
ingger to master it. In strong confirmation of this view 
is the fact that the studies in which pupils take little 
interest are likely to be those in which their teachers take 
little interest, while their favorite studies are also likely to 
be the favorite studies of their teachers. These facts are 
no doubt due in part to the quality of the teaching, but 
by no means wholly’so. Broadly speaking, the ques- 
tion how far the school is itself the parent of its own 
difficulties, is a curious one. 
Again, the likes and dislikes of pupils for certain 
studies are due even more to the influence of their fellow- 
Imitation pupils than to the influence of their parents and 
and Studies. teachers. A boy of my acquaintance, living in 
one town, could not be persuaded to study Latin, but on 
removal to another town ‘he entered upon the study and 
pursued it with pleasure. The study, certainly, was the 
same nor had his mind changed, except, in a super- 
ficial sense. The explanation of the change of mind was 
simply that his companions in the one town did not 
study Latin, while those in the other town did. This fact is 
_ but one of many showing that interest is often immediately 
dependent upon sympathy and imitation. These two 
factors are just as potent in the sphere of studies as 
they are in the sphere of behavior or conduct. Boys go 
away from home to school, resolutely determined that: 
they are not interested in certain subjects, and will noc 
study them, who, within a year or two, find great pleasure 
in prosecuting these very studies, while neglecting others 
that they had intended to pursue. Some interests die out, 
while others spring up and take their places. Still it 
must bg said that the change is not always due to change 
of fashion, that is, to imitation, but is often the result of 
mental growth. 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
136 THE ART OF STUDY, 
It is the same way with vocations; in America there 
could hardly be a more fallible guide to the callings that 
Vocations. young boys will pursue when they become men 
than their present ideas and protestations. Even when 
the man follows the vocation that the boy had chosen, the 
fact is due oftener to the pressure of necessity or to imita- 
tion than it is to the working of permanent interests. 
In respect to school studies, a personal element of 
importance is involved. A subject is attractive to a 
pupil when taught by one teacher, but is un- Personal 
Elementin attractive when taught by another. In 
many cases this is due to the different ways in 
which the subject is presented, but not unfrequently it 
is due to the personality of the teacher.) In truth, an 
unattractive subject is frequently only an unattractive 
teacher. This is an important topic, which will come Interest. 
before us again. 
It is perfectly true that interests often root far 
deeper down in the mind than these superficial facts 
The Deeper WOuld suggest. Aptitudes and inaptitudes for 
Interests. studies and vocations are sometimes inborn, 
and not unfrequently declare themselves at an early age. 
Here are found the geniuses and semi-geniuses that 
Nature gives to the world. But this description does not 
apply to the large majority of children and youth in 
cither particular, The average boy is not singled out by 
Nature as especially fitted for this study or for that pur- 
suit; if he were so singled out, he would not be the 
average boy. He is cut off by Nature from the success- 
ful prosecution of many studies and vocations, but, within 
wide limits, he can become interested in and can succeed 
in a large variety of things. In respect to vocations, the 
boy who becomes a miner in Wales or a fisherman in 
 
-P-A-G-E-137
  CULTIVATION OF PASSIVE ATTENTION. 137 
Holland, becomes a dairyman in Wisconsin or a wheat- 
grower in Dakota, succeeding equally well, so far as we can 
discover, in all these vocations. It is not the intention to 
minimize the variation that comes from Nature, but only 
to keep it within its proper limits. It is one of the topics 
of educational interest that are treated with much exag- 
geration. Deep-sea currents carry vast icebergs against 
both wind and tide, while surface currents are themselves 
the creations of wind and tide.

discrimination. Externally the two classes of interest 
are very much alike, although so different in essential 
character. Accordingly, the various signs of interest in 
pupils is a subject that the teacher should constantly 
study. One very practical question is, What shall the 
teacher do when he cannot decide whether a pupil’s pres- 
ent dislike for a study is permanent or transient? Ob- 
viously, if the study is an important one, he should 
‘make all reasonable efforts to arouse interest and over- 
come the dislike. If he fails the subject may be dropped 
for a time, and then the effort to awaken interest be 
renewed. If reasonable effort thus renewed fails to ac- 
complish the end, it is safe to infer that the dislike is 
not a superficial one. But it is fortunate that the normal 
pupil, with infrequent exceptions, can be interested in the 
essential studies of the elementary school. In fact, as we 
have already seen, looking at the subject from another

point of view, the interests of the normal child are the 
great criterion in selecting the studies of the school.

The last sentences suggest certain dangers that lie atone 
end of the doctrine of interest. Many more dangers no 
doubt lie at the other end. Practically the 
fleeting impressions, the mere notions, whims, 
or caprices of children are not unfrequently mis- 
taken for permanent attractions or repulsions, and are 
made criteria for conducting their education. There 
could be no greater mistake. Temporary interests are by 
no means to be disregarded ; even the most fleeting im- 
pressions of the child have some significance; but often 
the teacher’s first duty is to see how soon and how far 
he can turn the tide of interest into a new channel. The

destroys others. He works through stimulus which he 
must in some cases supply, and in others withhold. 
The subject may be viewed from another quarter. It 
is now common to denounce the old regimen for children, 
The Puritan that of the Puritans, for instance, as repressive, 
Regimen. or even oppressive. We are told that children 
did not enjoy the liberty to which they were properly en- 
titled, and were dwarfed or made lopsided in their develop- 
ment. No doubt there is much truth in this view of the 
matter. At the same time, it is possible to go too far 
in the opposite direction, with the result that children, 
with all their liberty or freedom, will suffer from weakness 
and enfeebled character. 
It is not meant to deny ecithe? that children do differ 
in their capacities and interests, or that the fact should 
be recognized both in the home and in the school. The 
sole purpose of what has been said is, rather, to call a halt 
long enough to inquire seriously how much room shall be 
made in elementary education for what is called zuterest. 
The tendency that is seen in some quarters to look 
upon what are deemed “interests” with something of 
fatalistic awe is to be deplored. Hard work, and plenty 
of it, and not the passive resignation of the mind to the 
stream of interest, is the condition of thorough scholar- 
ship. <A gelatinous regimen will not suffice. The lesson

  CHAPTER XV. 
ACTIVE ATTENTION : THE WILL. 
BEFORE we take up the cultivation of the active atten- 
tion as a practical problem, we must consider yet further 
its value or its place both in educational theory and prac- 
tice. Our thesis is that its proper cultivation is the edu- 
cational problem, We must, however, first take a single 
look backward. 
The reflex mental life is the mental life characteristic of 
childhood and immaturity. Contrary to the common 
mne chita’s Opinion, perhaps, the child has little will power 
Life Reflex. or power of self-direction ; at first he has abso- 
lutely none, but is the sport of the world about him, the 
creature of circumstances. To a degree his environment 
may be shaped by his seniors, as his parents, for an edu- 
cational purpose, but the principle isthe same. He knows 
and pursues the things that fascinate him, and his educa- 
tion is wholly negative. Now he is absorbed in one 
thing, and now inanother. He flits from object to object 
as the bee or the butterfly flits from flower to flower. 
Only two things can be said of him with certainty—he is 
sure to have many interests in the course of a day, and 
none of them will continue long. This reflex life is also 
characteristic of the undeveloped man and the savage,

to be pulled by suggesting strings, capable of being 
played upon by every one who shall have made him- 
self master of our springs of action.” 
Dr. Harris writes to the same effect. To grasp his 
meaning fully, however, we must remember that he does 
not recognize passive attention as attention at all, but 
bounds the activity by the exercise of the will. 
“The person without a well-developed power of attention is ina 
state of passivity toward invading external influences. He is a prey 
to impressions that come from his environment. Most 
Dr. Harris of these ‘early impressions’ of which we hear so much 
on Atten- . . so + . 
aGorie were received at a time when trivial things could seize upon 
us and absorb our powers of observation to the neglect 
of more essential things. Such passive impressibility, the condition 
of the childish memory, it is the object of education to eradicate. The 
pupil must learn to exclude and ignore the many things before him, and 
to concentrate all his powers of mind on the one chosen subject. . . « 
Intellectual culture begins when the will first commences to act 
on the senses. Its first action produces what is called attention. 
Attention selects one object out of the manifold and collects the vari- 
ous impressions made upon its senses, while it wilfully neglects the 
multitude of other objects that are in its presence—it inhibits the con- 
sideration of these others. Attention, then, may be regarded as the 
name of the first union of the will with the intellect. It turns the 
chaos of sense-impressions into a system by connecting them with a 
focus arbitrarily chosen. 
“ Intellectual training begins with the habit of attention. In this ac- 
tivity will and intellect are conjoined. The mind in this exercises its 
first self-determination. It says to the play of sense and idle fancy: 
Stop and obey me; neglect that, and notice this. The indefinitely 
manifold objects always present before the senses vanish, and one ob- 
ject engrosses the mind. This is the s¢ze gua non of intellectual 
culture.” ?

it shall do so. A score of objects more interesting than 
the one selected may clamor for recognition, but the will 
excludes them all, more or less effectually, and holds the 
chosen object in the focus of consciousness. In the early 
stage of culture, as we have seen, the child’s will is weak,

vironment. This stage of keen competition for the 
child’s attention should be closely watched by the teacher. 
It is the most critical period in his education, both men- 
tal and moral. Professor James is on firm ground when 
he tells teachers that the reflex, passive attention, which 
seems to make the child belong less to himself than to 
every object which happens to catch his notice, is the first 
thing which they have to overcome. Such is the first 
fact to be firmly grasped.

sometimes called, cling to any matter hour after hour, or 
even minute after minute. The choice or act of selection 
must be constantly renewed. In fact, what is called sus-' 
tained attention is nothing but a series of choices or elec- 
tions of the object chosen. -Still more, this series is of 
necessity short, particularly in the cases of school chil- 
dren, for the same reason that the single act of choice is 
short—it is an exhaustive mental operation. This is the 
second fact to be grasped. 
That fixed volitional attention is difficult is perfectly

well understood by all persons who have ever given 
pia. such attention to serious matters. It is par- 
tention ticularly so in the cases of children, for rea- 
Hard to sons that have already been stated. But, 
no matter how hard it is for the child in school 
to give attention, his attention we must have, and his 
active attention at that. The concentration of power 
that comes directly from interest will not suffice, for that 
finally leaves the mind unregulated and roaming at large ; 
the will must focus the mind if there is to be any real 
education or discipline. There is no getting on without 
attention if the school is to accomplish its purpose. Un- 
less, therefore, the teacher can get and can hold the 
child’s attention he may dismiss immediately the idea of 
doing him anything more than temporary, fleeting good. 
What then shall be done? Fortunately, the answer to 
this question is as decisive as it is important. 
1. It is plainly necessary to reénforce the active at- 
tention from some source outside of itself, or, at least, 
ttneeas Outside of the will. Nor is there any room 
Reénforce- for doubt as to the quarter where we are 
noe to seek and find such reénforcement. We 
are to seek and to find it in interest. Unless some ele- 
ment of interest can be found in the object of attention 
that the will has chosen, or can speedily be brought into 
it, attention will flag and will soon defy all the teacher’s 
efforts to renew it. The school child cannot hold on to 
some chosen object of attention as a monkey can cling 
with its tail to the branch of atree. This element of in- 
terest that is so indispensable may be either old or new; 
if old, it will at first pass unnoticed; if new, it must still 
be something like an old interest. 
2. It is, then, the appearance of some element of in-
-P-A-G-E-147
ACTIVE ATTENTION: THE WILL. 147 
terest, old or new as the case may be, that makes pro- 
tracted voluntary attention possible. In other Passive At- = : 
tention such Words, active attention must be buttressed at 
pee last upon passive attention. In fact, the dif- 
8 ference between the active and the passive atten- 
tion may, in one sense, be easily exaggerated. In- 
terest is involved in both, sooner or later, if attention is 
protracted or sustained. The question will therefore oc- 
cur to some readers, Why then make so much pother 
about the matter? In dealing with attention, why 
not drop all talk about passive and active, reflex and 
voluntary, and confine the discussion wholly to interest ? 
The question is a fair one, and the answer important. 
Moreover, it is an answer that can be given in few and 
decisive words. 
3. In passive attention objects of interest, one after 
another, dominate the mind. It matters not what these 
mhe wit Objects are or why they are interesting; nor is 
Focuses the there any necessary relation existing between Intellect in : : : :

tention. value, especially in early life. The sway of 
interest is the abandonment of the life to environment. 
In active attention, on the other hand, the will first 
chooses some object that is deemed worthy to be chosen, 
and then, although it cannot by its unbroken authority 
hold this object in the focus of the mind without the 
help of interest, it can renew the choice once and again, 
and, what is more, summon interest to its assistance. In 
this case the will both chooses the path and checks 
attempts to abandon it; in the other, there is no choice 
or attempt at self-regulation. To some this difference 
may seem unimportant and trivial. Not so; on the 
other hand, this difference measures the whole interval 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
148 THE ART OF STUDY. 
that separates, in effect, the untrained and the trained 
man. The common admonitions, “Try again,” “ Per- 
severe,” “ Do not become discouraged,” “ Hold on,” and 
the like, all of which are addressed to the will, show the 
estimation in which this voluntary element is held. Popu- 
lar speech testifies to its efficacy and value. The same may 
be said, also, of the examples of courage, resolution, and 
fortitude that play so important a part in the development 
of the child-life: they energize the will as well as en- 
kindle interest. Thus popular usage, as well as popular 
speech, bears its testimony to the importance of will-de- 
velopment as an element in education. 
4. It may be said that the choice which the will makes 
in respect to attention is only a choice among interests. 
In the long run, there is some truth in this view 
of the subject, since voluntary attention, if con- 
tinued, tends to pass into habit, and so to be- 
come reflex attention; but it is by no means wholly true. 
The well-disciplined man, no matter how thoroughly his 
mind becomes grooved, always has a considerable capac- 
ity for action wholly outside of his immediate interests. 
The man who can do nothing except what interests him, 
no matter what his interests are, is not even half a 
man. 
It has appeared very plainly in the course of our dis- 
cussion that the cultivation of the pupil’s attention is a 
difficult matter, involving much skill in the teacher. As 
Compayré says: Choice of 
Interests. 
“Nothing is so delicate or so fragile as the attention in its first

tion a refuge or defense against the ennuzd caused by studies illy 
adapted to his age.” + 
This is perfectly true. The springing plant must be 
cultivated with peculiar care, but if forcing the child to 
hold his mind on uninteresting things leads to permanent 
habits of inattention, the abandonment of the child to his 
fancies leaves his mind unsettled and fickle. 
The truth is, as Ribot says, that spontaneous attention, 
and, above all, voluntary attention are exceptional states 
of mind. Eliminate from consciousness, as he 
Attention does, “ the general routine of life—that enorm- an Excep- ; : tional State Ous mass of habits that move us like automatons,

ness; ... theperiods of our mental life in which 
we are purely passive simply because the order and suc- 
cession of our states of consciousness are given to us from 
without, and because their serial connection is imposed 
upon us;... that state of relative intellectual repose in 
which people ‘ think of nothing,’” or “ when the states of 
consciousness have neither intensity nor clear determina- 
tion,” and finally, “all states of passion and violent agita- 
tion, with their disorderly flux and diffusion of move- 
ments,”—eliminate all these things, “ with perhaps a few ~ 
others,” and “we may then credit to the general account 
of attention that which remains.” “In this general ac- 
count,” he continues, “the cases of spontaneous attention 
make up by far the greater number; the clear and indis- 
putable cases of voluntary attention constitute the 
minority; in many men and women they amount almost 
to nothing.” Moreover, the cause of the difference he

p. 58. 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
150 THE ART OF STUDY. 
finds, in part, in “the fact of common experience that in 
the state of fatigue, the state of exhaustion, attention is 
very difficult, often impossible, and always without dura- 
tion. And the reason is, that attention, by its very nature, 
more than any other intellectual state requires a great 
expenditure of physical force, which has to be produced 
under particular conditions.”? While this account is true 
in the main, it in no way disproves, but rather confirms, 
the contention that the highest aim of education is to 
develop volitional control of the mind. Small as may 
be the portion of life that falls under the head of volun- 
tary attention, it is still incalculably the most productive 
and valuable part of life. 
Great indeed is the waste of time and energy caused by 
indecision and irresolution. I speak now not of practical 
matters, but of studies. Said Professor Moses Stuart: 
“While one man is deliberating whether he had better 
study a language, another man has obtained it.” To the 
same effect are the well-known words of Dr. Johnson: 
“Whilst you stand deliberating which book your son 
shall read first, another boy has read both. Read any- 
thing five hours a day, and you will soon become 
learned.” 
The value of vigorous will is abundantly shown in his- 
tory. It is the backbone of character—more than any- 
vatueor thing else it is character. Intellectual pursuits 
Vigorous sometimes tend to break down the will. Mr. 
we Lowell mentions an engineer who knew how to 
build a bridge so well that he could never build one. 
Hamlet could not screw his courage to the sticking point 
because he had so many ideas in his head.

“ And thus the native hue of resolution 
Is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought; 
And enterprises of great pith and moment, 
With this regard their currents turn awry, 
And lose the name of action.” 
Coleridge is often given as a conspicuous example of a 
man of great gifts, who never accomplished what he should 
have accomplished because he was indolent and of feeble 
will. Mr. Lowell, in his address on Coleridge delivered in 
Westminster Abbey, expresses doubt whether he was a 
great poet and a great teacher, but says he had the almost 
overabundant materials of both. Lowell characterizes him 
happily inthe sentence: “No doubt we have in Coleridge 
the most striking example in literature of a great genius 
given in trust to a nerveless will and a fitful purpose.”

tion!” and lectures by the teacher addressed to the pupils 
about attention, defining and extolling it, do not avail. 
Pupils are not influenced for good by such exclamations 
or such homilies. The teacher will not get attention by 
demanding it as his right, or begging for it asa favor ; by 
urging upon pupils the importance of the thing, or the 
value of the lessons that he has to teach. When the 
moment arrives for the session of the school to open, 
morning or afternoon, the call “ Attention!” like the 
stroke of the bell or other signal, may bring the school 
to order and settle the scholars down to their work. The 
same may be said of other similar occasions during the 
day, as when there is achange of classes, or some unusual 
cause has thrown the school into temporary confusion. 
But beyond this, such calls as “ Order!” “ Attention!” and 
the like, do harm rather than good. Asa rule, the nois- 
iest and least attentive schools are those in which such 
cries are most frequently heard. The psychology of the 
matter is briefly presented by Professor J. M. Baldwin in 
these sentences: 
“Tt is a familiar principle that attention to the thought of amove- 
ment tends to start that very movement. I defy any of my readers

Quoted. There is no better way to make it difficult for a child to 
sit still than to tell him to sit still ; for your words fill up his attention, 
as I have occasion to say above, with the thought of movements, and 
these thoughts bring on the movements, despite the best intentions of 
the child in the way of obedience.” 4 
To adapt Professor Baldwin’s language to the present 
case, there is no more effective way to make it hard or

them. In reality they are a part of ourselves. The 
pie, mental law that whatever costs us effort 
Tend to almost necessarily becomes valuable to us, 
ees causes the succulent plant of interest to grow 
up out of the dry ground of irksome employ- 
ments. Not only does activity spring from interest, but 
interest springs from activity. Nor does the series neces- 
sarily begin with interest ; it may begin with choice. The 
mother loves best the child that has cost her most care; 
the minister or the Sunday-school teacher cannot be in- 
different to the church or the school that has been an 
object of thought and sacrifice ; while the veteran scholar 
becomes so much interested in his favorite study that 
he tends to exaggerate its relative importance. We 
read that Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they 
seemed unto him but a few days for the love he had for 
her. Yes, but his love grew the more by reason of his 
long, hard service. The interests, like the passions, grow 
with what they feed on. No matter how we are brought 
to follow any course of action, unless it is forced upon 
us, we can hardly look upon it with utter indifference, 
and, even when it is compulsory, we tend to become rec- 
onciled and even interested. This is one of the reactions 
of the will upon knowledge. No man can compute the 
extent to which this simple law of mind smooths the path- 
way of life, making tolerable or even pleasant employ- 
ment of what would otherwise be intolerable servi- 
tude. The principle underlies the great lesson that 
Jesus taught: “It is more blessed to give than to re- 
ceive.”

time and method. If a pupil can learn a lesson in thirty 
minutes, he should not be given an hour in which to do 
the work. If superfluous time is allowed him, he is 
almost certain to become careless, his wits go wool-

may be stated still more strongly. As a rule, pupils will 
prepare their work better in thirty minutes than in 
double the time, provided thirty minutes is enough, 
unless they are held toa very close account by the teacher. 
Beyond a certain point the kind of preparation that the 
pupil makes for his recitation is quite apt to vary in- 
versely as the amount of time that is allowed him to 
prepare it is lengthened. But this is not the most im- 
portant thing. The pupil forms his habits of study 
while preparing his lessons, or he ‘acquires his art of 
study while actually studying; and, in the long run, his 
art is of greater importance than the immediate lessons 
that are mastered. The habits of mind that he forms in 
the school mark the pupil long after his formal lessons 
are forgotten. Moreover, there is no worse habit for pu- 
pils to acquire than that of dawdling or dreaming over 
their books or lessons. 
Teachers should, therefore, allow their pupils time 
enough to do their work, but not more than enough. 
Furthermore, they should sce to it that the Teachers to i ts 2 )

for them ; some are quicker, some slower. The difficulty 
 
-P-A-G-E-158

that the facts suggest is incidental to the graded system 
of schools, and, in fact, to all class instruction; nor is it 
altogether easy to overcome this difficulty. It is an ob- 
vious suggestion, however, that extra work may be as- 
signed to the brighter and quicker pupils, so as to give 
them ample employment while the slower and duller 
pupils are preparing their regular lessons. 
Something will be said in another place about the 
emotional climate of the school: here a word or two 
is called for relative to its intellectual atmos- ‘The Intel- lectuat At- phere. This should be electrical with curios-

be on their mettle. If these elements are se- 
cured, present lessons will be better learned, future habits 
of study will be better formed, and those intellectual 
conditions will be established which are most conducive 
to mental health. On the other hand, in the slack, feeble, 
nerveless school, the intellectual and moral vices thrive 
apace. 
Much depends upon the character and conduct of the 
teacher. The teacher who has a well-developed power of 
attention will be much more successful than the one who 
has no such power. If the pupils see the teacher consist- 
ently pursuing a chosen end, if they perceive 
unity of purpose and determination in all that 
he does, they are strongly influenced by the 
example. It may be duetosympathy, to imitation, or to 
some other cause, but there is no disputing the fact. The 
pupils fall into the prevailing current. This may be merely 
a result of automatic action, but it helps wonderfully on 
the active, voluntary side. On the other hand, if the pu- 
pils see that the teacher is vacillating or irresolute, if 
they discover that he has no settled aim, or, having one, The Teacher 
a Factor.

cannot pursue it, they respond to his spirit, unconsciously 
to themselves and to him. An energetic teacher 
will energize pupils, while a limp-minded one will 
make pupils like himself. There is a mental as well as 
a physical fatherhood and motherhood, and it is alto- 
gether of a higher character. This is one reason why 
the ancient Jews set the teacher above the parent: 
the one gave the child spiritual life; the other only 
natural life. 
Attention depends largely upon favorable physical 
conditions. The health of the pupil, his physical tone,

Conditions. furniture, the comfort or the discomfort of the 
schoolroom, the order in which the pupils are seated, 
the occurrence of recess or recreation periods—these are 
all things to be carefully considered. If children are 
sick, if the seats in which they sit keep them in continual 
pain, if the air is highly impure, if the temperature is 
much too high or much too low, if the light is painful to 
their eyes,—it is plain, or should be plain, that they can 
not give close attention to their lessons. Men are begin- 
ning to understand much better than in former times 
the extent to which these physical factors directly affect 
study and school education, and thus become moral causes 
themselves. The new psychology is amplifying and 
enforcing the old lessons, if not discovering new ones. 
When a distinguished physician of London said that he 
regulated the number of blankets on his bed by the ther. 
mometer and not by his sensations, he may have been 
rather absurd, or at least mechanical; but to find moral 
causes in degrees Fahrenheit is a strictly rational pro- 
ceeding.

school. So far fr iviti - ee ol. So far from such activities always re 
Movements tarding, they often accompany and facilitate 
sustained attention. Changes of position not 
only relieve the body but stimulate brain activ- 
ity. On this point Ribot has written : and Atten- 
tion. 
“Everybody knows that attention, at least in its reflected form, is 
at times accompanied by movements. Many people seem to find that 
walking to and fro helps them out of perplexity; others 
strike their forehead, scratch their head, rub their eyes, 
move their arms and legs about in an incessant, rhyth- 
mical fashion. This, indeed, is an expenditure, not an economy, 
of motion, But it is a profitable expenditure. The movements thus 
produced are not simple mechanical phenomena acting upon our ex- 
ternal surroundings ; they act also through the muscular sense upon 
the brain, which receives them as it receives all other sensorial im- 
pressions, to the increase of the brain’s activity. A rapid walk, a race, 
will also quicken the flow of ideas and words.” 2 Ribot 
Quoted. 
A full discussion of the subject would involve the rela- 
tion of the motor activities to the intellectual activities. 
The child’s growing voluntary attention must be pro- 
tected against his spontaneous interests. If he is trying 
picking (tO fix his mind upon some chosen or appointed 
Influences. object, such as a lesson, he should be shielded 
as far as possible from other objects which may be of 
greater immediate attractiveness. It would be well in- 
deed if such things could for the time be altogether ex- 
cluded from his view. Dr. Harris speaks of “invading 
external influences,” and the phrase is happily chosen, 
suggesting the opposition that exists between external 
objects that are immediately present to the senses and 
real intellectual activities, such as judgment and thinking.

At a time when much is said, and very properly too, 
about cultivating the senses through objective teaching, it 
is important to remember that the higher faculties cannot 
grow unless, for the time being, the world of sense is shut 
out from the mind. In fixing the mind upon a subject, 
it is sometimes of advantage to close the eyes, thus shut- 
ting out the sense world altogether. Some persons 
have even found a compensation for blindness in the 
greater command that they thus gained over their own 
minds. President Dwight, the distinguished scholar and 
theologian, who lived early in the century, accord- 
ing to Dr. John Todd, “used to consider the loss of his 
eyes a great blessing to him, inasmuch as it strength- 
ened the power of attention and compelled him to 
think.” 
The principle that has been presented has many im- 
portant applications, both in the home and in the school.

Removed. 4 act of folly to dangle a pair of skates before 
his eyes at the very moment that he is trying to learn 
his lesson. The girl who is more interested in attending 
social parties than she is in learning grammar and history 
should not be tempted to indulgence in that direction, 
but those interests should rather be repressed. The rule 
involves the exclusion from the school of what are called 
distracting influences. Order should be maintained, not 
merely for the sake of moral discipline, but so that the 
pupils may be able to learn and to recite their lessons. 
Silence is one of the moral virtues in school. Then, the 
school environment is only less important than the in-

ment. But the matter may be overdone. In 
fact, there is reason to fear that schoolroom decoration 
will become a fad, if it has not already done so. At least 
one thing is clear, viz.: the schoolroom may be made so 
attractive to the eye or the ear, sensuous elements may be 
so accumulated, that real intellectual labor will either be 
carried on with much difficulty or be wholly stifled. A

that all interests, wide and diversified as they become, 
are developed from a few ultimate roots. Characterized 
from the teacher's point of view, the transference of inter- 
ests is sometimes called borrowing. Every person who 
has given particular thought to the matter has been sur- 
prised to see the extent to which such borrowing is actu- 
ally carried on in the mental life. It isa process of first 
importance to teachers. 
An example of a borrowed interest may be taken from 
common life. A lady who was in feeble health formas 
Borrowing number of years found congenial employment, 
mace as well as relief from pain, in the care of a 
ample. small collection of potted plants. Her in- 
terest, which was a pure outgrowth of illhealth and 
enforced abstinence from her accustomed employments, 
tended to grow beyond the limits of her own small collec- 
tion. On her death, her mother, an elderly woman, who 
had never shown any real interest in flowers, and had 
found plenty of occupation in other things, became at- 
tached to this collection of plants solely because they had 
belonged to her dear daughter. Nor was this all; these 
particular plants created a growing interest in other plants, 
which ended only with the lady’s life. Coming back 
again to an old topic: interests far from being deter- 
minate in number and permanent in character, are rather 
of easy propagation and of a plastic nature. 
Coming nearer to the school, Ribot gives this interest- 
ing example of using one interest to build up another :

CULTIVATION OF ACTIVE ATTENTION. 167 
What has been said about building up one interest 
through another one suggests the dependence of studies 
A Question Upon one another, or what is known in the 
of Correla- science of education as the problem of correla- tion. . ; 
tion, or of correlated studies: The practical 
significance of this problem, which will not be treated in 
this place at length, is that the wise teacher uses one 
study to teach another. Changing the form of the 
expression, correlation consists in organizing studies, or 
the teaching of studies, so as to make work done in one sub- 
ject contribute to progress in one or more other subjects. 
Passing by a larger topic, or correlation proper, a pupil’s 
interest in geography is invoked by the teacher of his- 
tory, and vice versa; or the teacher lays all the pupil’s 
attainments under contribution in teaching literature, 
which comes nearer than any other subject to being a 
full expression of human life. 
Ribot thus describes the methods to be employed in 
calling out and solidifying voluntary attention: 
“In the first period, the educator acts only upon simple feelings. 
He employs fear in all its forms, egotistic tendencies, the attraction of 
Ribot on rewards, tender and sympathetic emotions, as well as our 
Calling Out innate curiosity, which seems to be the appetite of intel- 
Active ligence, and which to a certain degree — no matter how

weak — is found in everybody. 
“During the second period, artificial attention is aroused and main- 
tained by means of feelings of secondary formation, such as love of 
self, emulation, ambition, interest in a practical line, duty, etc. 
“The third period is that of organization ; attention is aroused and 
sustained by habit. The pupil in the class room, the workman in his 
shop, the clerk at his office, the tradesman behind his counter, all 
would, as a rule, prefer to be somewhere else ; but egotism, ambition, 
and interest have created by repetition a fixed and lasting habit. Ac- 
quired attention has thus become a second nature, and the artificial

pupils are able to consider what is good for them, and so 
to pay some attention to the art of study in a reflective

the subject, for they are, or should be, students them-

able them to get a sound understanding of it. The mind 
is like the quick, sensitive plate of the camera, but it is 
not quick enough to receive clear, strong pictures of ob- 
jects on a single short exposure. 
What has now been said is true of perceptive or simple 
concrete ideas, but if possible, it is even more true of gen- 
eral ideas, and of the conclusions that are reached by 
thinking. One reason why so much thinking is wrong is 
that it starts with imperfect ideas of the things that are 
made the objects of thought. In the following passage 
Dr. Faraday shows how necessary clear and precise ideas 
are to secure the proper exercise of the judgment: 
“One exercise of the mind which largely influences the power and 
character of the judgment is the habit of forming clear and precise 
zdeas. If, after considering a subject in our ordinary 
Dr. Faraday manner, we return upon it with the special purpose of 
aa noticing the condition of our thoughts, we shall be 
astonished to find how little precise they remain. On 
recalling the phenomena relating to a matter of fact, the circum- 
stances modifying them, the kind and amount of action presented, 
the real or probable result, we shall find that the first impres- 
sions are scarcely fit for the foundation of a judgment and that 
the second thoughts will be best. For the acquirement of a good 
condition of mind in this respect, the thoughts should be trained to a 
habit of clear and precise formation, so that vivid and distinct impres- 
sions of the matter in hand, its circumstances and consequences, 
may remain,” 2

who considers the defects and tendencies of teachers,

cause all the reasons fro and con are not present in the 
mind at the same time. This is the source of “ the vari- 
ous purposes or inclinations that alternately prevail, and 
the uncertainty that perplexes us.” 
2. Thoroughness in the matter immediately in hand is 
essential to future thoroughness and progress in knowl- 
ae edge. What is learned to-day is the founda- 
vaiueof tion of what will be learned to-morrow; and, if 
eee et the foundation is weak and insecure, so will the 
: superstructure be. The pupil’s theoretical or 
scientific arithmetic is an outgrowth of his concrete num- 
ber work. His knowledge of the natural and physical 
sciences is built up on the basis of his first contacts with 
the natural or physical world. His history and his civics 
are developed out of his daily observations of men in the 
little society or social world about him. His moral and 
religious conceptions originate in his personal experi- 
ences in the home and in the social circle. ‘If aman love 
not his brother whom he hath seen,” it has been asked, 
“how can he love God whom he hath not seen?” What 
could be more natural or inevitable, then, than that the 
false or imperfect ideas which characterize these early sub- 
jects of knowledge should more or less mark the whole 
later mental and moral development ? 
3. The final reason why school work should be well 
done is that, while the pupil is doing it, he is building up 
mental habits which will cling to him through life. This 
point has been dwelt upon in dealing with attention, but 
the fact should again be emphasized that good teaching 
leads to two results: one, the acquisition of knowledge; 
the other, mental discipline. The mind is furnished and 
formed at the same time, but only too often in its forma- 
tion the element of discipline is overlooked in whole

such steps may in reality lead forward. What is more, a 
false or an erroneous idea once lodged in a person’s mind 
stands in the way of his forming a true or a correct idea. 
His mind is “ littered up,” so to speak; or, as the physio- 
logical psychologists say, the nervous currents are 
running in wrong channels and it is hard to change 
them. It is the same way with thought. In thinking, 
the mind runs over a certain path connecting certain ideas, 
and if, for any reason, this path swerves to the right or to 
the left, it will be found a hard thing to straighten it after- 
wards. The process called thinking consists simply in 
putting things or ideas together in certain relations, and 
if they are not properly related a false view of the whole 
subject is given, which it is not easy to change. Ex- 
perience teaches us how difficult it is to change a man’s 
fixed ideas, judgments, or opinions, that is, to make over 
his mind. Here we strike the psychological fact that lies 
back of the stress which is so deservedly placed upon first 
impressions — they are apt to be lasting, no matter how 
partial or imperfect they may be. All experienced teach- 
ers know how hard a task it is to teach a subject prop- 
erly to a pupil who has already been taught improperly. 
The common opinion is that it is easier to take the pupil 
fresh, at the beginning, and there is much evidence to 
support that opinion. 
The relations of the intellect and the will, or of knowl- 
edge and choice, have already come before us in a former

names constantly come to express more and more mean- 
ing. Our early ideas may be likened to forms or vessels 
into which experience is continually pouring new meaning 
or new thought. The pupil in the eighth grade cannot 
have Francis Parkman’s conception of the French and 
Indian War, or Carl Ritter’s conception of the Continent 
of Europe, no matter how long or how intensely he may 
dwell upon the subject. The clear and precise ideas for 
which Dr. Faraday so justly pleads are not fixed ideas or 
quantitative ideas. Perhaps not one man in a million 
has Faraday’s own clear and precise conceptions of the 
fundamental facts of physics andchemistry. Accordingly, 
the teacher in the school constantly faces the question. 
How far shall clear ideas and clear thinking be insisted 
upon? 
The matter may be put in another way. Mental ac- 
tion tends to fixity and permanence—tends to flow in 
“@rooy- habitual channels, or, as one may say, tends to 
ing”the groove and channel the mind. Now a certain 
aes amount of such grooving or channeling is 
essential to mental efficiency. It is just as necessary that 
mental energy, to be effective, shall be concentrated in 
particular lines or at particular points as it is that steam, 
to be effective, shall be confined ina steam chest and cylin. 
der; diffusion or dissipation of force is just as fatalin the 
one case as in the other. Without this tendency to per- 
manence in modes of mental action, education would be 
impossible, and there could be no such thing as acquired 
character. At the same time, the mind may be over- 
grooved, that is, the grooves may become so deep and 
so narrow that the man is practically incapable of effect- 
ive action outside of his routine, or, as the saying is, out- 
side of his ruts. Sound education oscillates between the Art of Study—12

solution will then be found more difficult to acquire. The more thor- 
oughly a method is learned, the more it becomes part of the mind, and 
the greater the repugnance of the mind toward a new method. For 
this reason, parents and teachers discourage young children from the 
practice of counting on the fingers, believing that it will cause much 
trouble later to root out this vicious habit, and replace it by purcly men- 
tal processes. Teachers should be careful, especially with precocious 
children, not to continue too long in the use of a process that is be- 
coming mechanical ; for itis already growing into a second nature, and 
becoming a part of the unconscious apperceptive process by which 
the mind reacts against the environment, recognizes its presence, and 
explains it to itself. The child that has been overtrained in arithme- 
tic reacts apperceptively against his environment chiefly by noticing 
its numerical relations—he counts and adds; his other apperceptive 
reactions being feeble, he neglects qualities and causal relations. 
Another child, who has been drilled in recognizing colors, apperceives 
the shades of color to the neglect of all else. A third child, exces- 
sively trained in form studies by the constant use of geometric solids 
and much practice in looking for the fundamental geometric forms 
lying at the basis of the multifarious objects that exist in the world, 
will, as a matter of course, apperceive geometric forms, ignoring the 
other phases of objects.””? 
The subject can be pursued indefinitely, but one or two 
further instances will answer the present purpose. 
Lord Kames, for example, advanced the proposition 
that capacious memory and sound judgment are seldom 
Memory found in company.? His argument is that 
Bere ey memory involves the slight or loose relations 
‘ of ideas, while judgment rests upon the strong 
or close relations, and that the two mental habits are in- 
compatible. The truth turns, no doubt, upon the extent 
to which the individual relies upon his memory or his 
judgment. Either one may be cultivated, and especially

not unfrequently tries to make the work too intensive, and 
does not cover enough ground either to give breadth of 
view or to keep up the interest of the class. It must be 
remembered that a child looks upon a lesson much as he 
looks upon a picture; he tires of it, and demands some- 
thing new. It is very true that to overcome this love of 
change, or to hold the pupil to his work, is the great prob- 
lem of cultivating the attention; but the teacher must 
remember that this can be done only in a measure and 
by degrees. 
It is obvious enough that the principle involved has an 
important application in the matter of promotion. It is 
often necessary to require pupils to go a 
second time over a certain portion of the work 
that they havedone. The good of the pupil and the tone 
of the school both demand that this shall be done. Still, 
pupils should by no means be refused promotion in the 
flippant spirit that is characteristic of some teachers and 
superintendents. It sometimes happens that the pupil in 
going over this work a second time falls below the record 
that he made the first time. At the close of aterm’s work 
in algebra I once thought it my duty to deny a young 
man promotion with his class, and did so. It so happened 
that he made the same journey with me the second time, 
and what was my surprise when I found that his work the 
second term was inferior to what it had been the first 
term. He had actually lost ground and was less deserving 
of promotion now than he had been three months before. 
This experience led me to study the subject with more care 
than I had done before, and to be more careful in decid- 
ing upon such questions. It is no doubt true that sucha 
case as this is exceptional, but still it teaches a lesson.

good reasons for allowing the pupil to pass along ina 
study until he stands upon the verge of graduation, and 
then declining to graduate him. As amatter of course, the 
teacher or principal should cause the pupil to understand 
when he is promoted exactly what his status is and the 
causes that have produced it. Naturally, too, the pupil’s 
familiar friends should be duly informed of the facts in the 
case. It is true enough that the presence of a pupil who 
has not done satisfactory work in a class may impede the 
progress of the class, and this fact is to be taken into the 
account in settling the question of promotion. The prac- 
tical disposal of questions of promotion and graduation 
is difficult, calling for clear discrimination, sound judg- 
ment, good feeling, and no little moral courage. The 
more rigid the classification the greater the difficulty. 
The public often takes a hand in the discussion of pro- 
motions in schools. Upon the whole there can be no 
PublicIn-  Goubt that it favors a liberal policy. At the 
terest in same time, men are found in almost every 
Promotions. community who gruffly ask such questions as 
these: ‘‘ Why should pupils be sent to the high school 
before they have mastered the studies in the grades?” 
“Why should a boy take up algebra before he is perfect 
in arithmetic?” “Why should he begin a foreign lan- 
guage before he has first mastered his own language?” 
While mistakes are frequently made at these points, those 
who ask such questions, as a class, imperfectly understand 
the matter. They do not see that the pupils whom they 
have in mind cannot, save in a very limited sense, master 
their elementary studies, or that such a thing as over- 
grooving is not only possible but easy. Still less do 
they understand the dependence of the lower studies 
upon the higher ones, as of arithmetic upon algebra.  
-P-A-G-E-184

They fail to comprehend how it is that, in a certain very 
important sense, imperfect knowledge is absolutely neces- 
sary to progress in knowledge. It is perfectly true that 
school children should know more than they do know, 
and that the schools should be brought up to a higher 
standard. The true remedy, however, is not to refuse 
pupils promotion more frequently than at present, or to 
compel them to “drum” longer over the same lessons, 
but it is rather to teach them better while they are making 
their daily progress. 
In a practical sense, thoroughness does not mean that 
the pupil shall seek to cover the whole field, or even that 
eet 6 he shall cultivate intensively so much of it 
Narrowness asheseeksto compass. Toattempt either the 
ao one or the other may be fatal to the very 
thoroughness that he seeks. Touching the art 
of study, Dr. Alexander Bain lays down three funda- 
i. propositions which may be stated as follows : 
. Inthe early stages of education, instruction must 
te: narrow. 
2. Instruction must he thorough. 
3. Only when the pupil is completely at home in the 
main ideas—only when one single line of thought has 
been wrought into his mind—should the teacher begin to 
be'discursive and widen the path. 
Dr. Bain explains these propositions as follows: 
“Our first maxim is— Select a Text-book-in-chief.’ The meaning 
is that, when a large subject is to be overtaken by book study alone, 
some one work should be chosen to apply to, in the first instance, 
which work should be conned and mastered before any other is taken 
up. There being, in most “subjects, a variety of good books, the 
thorough student will not be satisfied in the long run without con- 
sulting several, and perhaps making a study of them all ; yet, it is un- 
wise to distract the attention with more than one, while the elements

are to be learnt. In Geometry, the pupil begins upon Euclid, or 
some other compendium, and is not allowed to deviate from the 
single line of his author. If he is once thoroughly at home on the 
main ideas and the leading propositions of Geometry, he is safe in 
dipping into other manuals, in comparing the differences of treat- 
ment, and in widening his knowledge by additional theorems, and by 
various modes of demonstration.” + 
If we remember that “narrow,” “broad,” and “ thor- 
ough ” are all relative terms, having no quantitative mean-

Quotation. Narrowness must precede breadth, and super- 
ficiality, depth. To attempt too much is to fail in every- 
thing. What folly it is, for example, in teaching history, 
to accustom the pupil to compare, interpret, and discuss 
facts before he has any sufficient supply of them on which 
to exercise his reflective faculties! In dealing with the 
history of a country or nation, the first thing to be done, 
after the purely story period is passed, is to fix in the 
pupil’s mind firmly the main points — an outline, a frame- 
work, in which he can dispose and arrange minor facts 
and details as he acquires them; or, to change the figure, 
to provide his mind with a supply of hooks and pegs on 
which he can hang-up in proper order and in due relation 
new facts and ideas as he masters them. To quote Dr. 
Bain once more: 
“History is preéminently a subject for method, and, therefore, in- 
volves some such plan as is here recommended, Every narrative read 
otherwise than for mere amusement, as we read a novel, should 
leave in the mind—(1) the chronological sequence (more or less 
detailed); and (2) the causal sequence, that is, the influences at work 
in bringing about the events. These are best gained by application to 
a single work in the first place; other works being resorted to in due 
time.” ?

are also known as elements or phases of consciousness. 
It will be seen that each of the three words is used in 
a double sense: it is used as the name of a faculty or 
process and also as the name of a product. Thus, will 
may be regarded both as a particular power or kind of 
mental activity, and as the result of such activity.

enter, and discover, by his dress, that it is a messenger 
from the telegraph office. I see a dispatch in his hand, 
which he holds out to me; my curiosity or desire is 
further stimulated; I stretch out my hand, seize the dis- 
patch, tear it open and read it ; the dispatch informs me that 
a business venture in which I am engaged has turned out 
favorably, or that a friend issick. This information begets 
fresh interest, and this again leads on to new choices, 
such as the decision to send a return dispatch or to under- 
take a journey, until the whole cycle is completed. 
A child playing on the floor gets a music box in his 
hands; his curiosity is awakened by the object and he be- 
*gins to experiment with it, turning it over and beating 
the floor with it; he strikes by accident a key and a sound 
is produced, thus enlarging his knowledge; his interest 
is increased and he strikes again ; and thus his knowledge, 
his feeling, and his will go on acting and reacting upon 
one another until the series of experiences is worked out 
and the child is for the time satisfied.

tion. The cause of these inverse variations of men- 
tal forces is, perhaps, that the mind has so much power 
to expend, and that, if much of this power is used in one 
way, little can be used in another way. But, no mat- 
ter what the explanation is, there is no mistaking either 
the law or its interpretation. 
There are still other facts to be considered. Age is a 
factor in the problem. A child’s feelings are more active 
neelrsaih than a man’s, not only absolutely but rela- 
ing, andIn- tively, in the same way that his logical facul- 
struction. ties are less active. Training and discipline 
also enter into the problem. Persons of the same age 
differ widely in the coérdination of the primary mental 
faculties. The savage and the undeveloped man show 
much of the spontaneity and impulse that mark the 
child. Nor is this all: inheritance remains to be con- 
sidered. Persons of equal general cultivation, as well 
as of the same age, differ sometimes almost as widely 
as children differ from adults. Some persons show habitual 
self-control from an early age, while others have little 
self-control when far advanced in life. It is a matter of 
temperament. In fact we classify men with respect to 
the relative prominence in their make-up of the elements 
of consciousness: one man is intellectual, another emo- 
tional, a third active or practical. 
So it is not strange that the feelings should present to 
the educator some very important problems. Perhaps

they make character. But here the immediate point is 
that they kill or impair, for the time, the intellectual life 
of the pupil. No young pupil can study or recite when 
he is deeply grieved or thoroughly angry. This phase 
of the subject Dr. Carpenter has treated in an admirable 
passage. 
“Those ‘strong-minded’ teachers who object to these modes of 
‘making things pleasant,’ as an unworthy and undesirable ‘weak- 
Dil Gas. ness,’ are ignorant that, in this stage of the child-mind, 
penteron the will —thatis, the power of se//control — is weak; and 
“willful- that the primary object of education is to encourage and 
ase strengthen, not to repress, that power. Great mistakes 
are often made by parents and teachers, who, being ignorant of this 
fundamental fact of child-nature, treat as w72/fudness what is in reality 
just the contrary of will-fullness; being the direct result of the want 
of volitional control over the automatic activity of the brain. To 
pnnish a child for the want of obedience which it has not the power to 
render, is to inflict an injury which may almost be said to be irrepar- 
able. For nothing tends so much to prevent the healthful develop- 
ment of the moral sense as the infliction of punishment which the 
child feels to be unjust ; and nothing retards the acquirement of the 
power of directing the intellectual processes so much as the emotional 
disturbance which the feeling of injustice provokes. Hence the de- 
termination often expressed to ‘ break the will’ of an obstinate child 
by punishment is almost certain to strengthen these reactionary in- 
fluences. Many a child is put into ‘durance vile’ for not learning 
‘the little busy bee’ who simply cannot give its small mind to the 
task, whilst disturbed by stern commands and threats of yet severer 
punishment for a disobedience it cannot help; when a suggestion 
kindly and skillfully adapted to its automatic nature, by directing the 
turbid current of thought and feeling into a smoother channel, and 
guiding the activity which it does not attempt to oppose, shall bring 
about the desired result, to the surprise alike of the baffled teacher, 
the passionate pupil, and the perplexed bystanders.” *

    3. The emotional adjustment of the young pupil to the 
teacher should receive attention. Whether the Emotional - : 
Adjustment pupil or student likes the teacher or not is al- 
oe er ways an important question. Young men and 
women in college may get a great deal of good 
out of old Professor Crusty, whom they hate, even pre- 
ferring him to young Professor Good-Nature, whom they 
like, because they recognize the ability-of the former and 
subdue their personal feelings; but young children are 
wholly incapable of making any such discrimination. 
Their relation to their teacher is determined wholly by 
their feelings, and not at all by’scientific interest. The 
result is that they get little or no good, and much harm, 
from a teacher whom they thoroughly dislike, no matter 
if the teacher be an admirable person or even a good 
teacher in another school. Even in colleges and universi- 
ties this emotional factor plays no small part. 
Accordingly, the temper of a teacher and his power of 
adaptation to pupils are among the things to be con- 
sidered in assigning him to a school, or even in his em- 
ployment. This is particularly the case in 
eee lower grade schools. Then it is one of the 
Adjust- first duties of the teacher, and of the primary 
: ae teacher especially, to adjust himself to his schol- 
ars, winning their confidence, respect, and love: Once 
more, when a teacher, after a fair trial, has failed to effect 
such an adjustment between himself and the school, the 
time has come for the school authorities to consider 
-whether he should not be transferred to another school, 
or, if circumstances require, be discontinued altogether. 
Such transference or discontinuance may involve some 
hardship to the teacher, but it is the right of the pupils. 
In another school or in another place he may do excel-     
 
-P-A-G-E-195
    FEELING, STUDY, AND LEARNING. 195 
jent work, but not in this school or place. No doubt a 
word of caution is needed. School administration and 
discipline should by no means be abandoned to the 
whims, notions, and caprices of school children; neither 
should the studies be determined with sole reference 
to their so-called interests. Still, their real feelings, like 
their real interests, must be respected within reasonable 
bounds. No man can estimate the harm that has been 
done to the minds and characters of children, and espe- 
cially of sensitive children, through association with 
nurses, tutors, and teachers who were distasteful or re- 
pulsive to them. On that point, biography, and still 
more autobiography, tells its own story. 
Hope and fear sometimes lead to the same result. 
They may strengthen one man and weaken another. 
sifiects of The man who is energetic by nature says, 
Hope and “The outlook is encouraging, we must make 
ae the most of it”; or, “It is discouraging, we 
must exert ourselves to the utmost.” The feeble man 
says, “ The prospect is hopeful, everything will come out 
right anyway ;”’ or, “‘ Nothing can be done, and it is useless 
to try.” The effect of hope and fear upon men depends 
upon the native tone, or the character, of the man. Some 
men are never so strong as when in the presence of danger, 
never so weak as when in the presence of security. The 
one situation nerves them to do their utmost ; the other lulls 
them to sleep. Others are strongest when animated by 
hope, weakest when depressed by fear. Such are some of 
the effects upon different minds of optimistic and pessimis- 
tic tones of thought and feeling. 
It is easy to see how what has just been said applies to 
children. They are rarely strengthened by any form of 
fear, and young children never are. They require a

warmer emotional climate. They need encouragement 
and hopefulness. And yet this is one of the places where 
it is important for the teacher to remember Solon’s maxim, 
“ Nothing in excess.”

METHODS OF LEARNING. 
No word employed in educational literature or discus- 
sion, or at least no word relating to teaching, has been 
Abuse of More abused than the word “ method.” This 
ieee , abuse is seen in the irrational emphasis that is 
* placed upon it, and the absurdity of its applica- 
tions. Teachers borrowed the word from philosophy and, 
having done so, proceeded to degrade it. They have not 
hesitated, for example, to apply it to the commonest ex- 
pedients and devices, and even tricks, of the schoolroom. 
We have the “letter” method, the “ word” method, and 
the “sentence” method of teaching reading ; the “oral” 
method and the “written” method of teaching spelling; 
the “oral” method and the “ book” method of teaching 
elementary science, and I know not how much more be- 
sides. In the literature of teaching, particularly the minor 
literature, the word is repeated ad nauseam, and, if possi- 
ble, still more frequently in lectures and class instruction. 
And then the stress that the advocates of different methods 
place on their little devices! As though men were never 
taught anything, or could be taught anything, except ac- 
cording to their particular prescriptions! It is no wonder 
that many sensible teachers, weary of “methods,” have

turned their faces away from method, as they hope, for- 
ever. 
But the subject cannot be gotten rid of in this easy 
fashion. Any man of sense will see this the moment he

fined and = M. Compayré defines method in general as “the Vindicated. i * : order that we voluntarily introduce into our 
thoughts, our acts, and our undertakings.” “To act me- 
thodically,” he says, “is the contrary of acting thoughtless. 
ly, inconsiderately, without continuity, and without plan. 
Port Royal justly defined method as the ‘art of rightly ar- 
ranging a series of several thoughts.’” And again: “Ina 
more precise and particular sense, method designates a 
whole body of rational processes, of rules, or means which 
are practiced and followed in the accomplishment of any 
undertaking.” }_ This brief account of the matter will 
show sufficiently that method is indispensable, and 
that it relates to the matter of our thoughts and their ex- 
pression rather than to the dexterities, physical or mental, 
of the daily life. Perhaps it is impossible, so strong is

M. Marion, quoted by Compayré, thus states the three great advantages of 
the man who proceeds rationally in every kind of practical work over him 
who lives on expedients. “ Starting with a fixed purpose, he runs‘less risk 
of losing sight of it and of missing his way. Having reflected on the 
means at his command, he has more chances of omitting none of them, 
and of always choosing the best. Finally, sure both of the end in view, 
and of the means of attaining it, it depends only on himself to reach it as 
soon as possible. ‘A lame man ona straight road,’ said Bacon, ‘reaches 
his destination sooner than a courier who misses his way.’”

to its pristine meaning; but it is possible todo something 
inthis direction. In this chapter we shall hold strictly 
to the original and proper meaning of the term. 
It is perfectly clear that methods of teaching depend 
upon methods of learning, or of acquiring knowledge, and 
Methods of that the teacher’s function is to help the pupil 
et to learn. Furthermore, the art of study must 
Learning. recognize also the methods of learning, or of 
acquirement, because study is only a means of learning. 
Pupils do not study simply for the sake of studying, but 
for the sake of gaining knowledge and discipline. Accord- 
ingly, it becomes necessary for us to give an account of 
the methods by which we learn or gain knowledge. This 
account will be as brief as is consistent with clearness. 
The first things that a child learns, or that he knows, 
are the sense-objects right about him in the world. These 
Perception. Objects impress his senses, or they produce sen- 
sations in the appropriate organ—touch, sight, 
hearing, taste, or smell; and these sensations the mind 
changes into mental pictures called perceptions, or they 
are ideated, as the text-books say. It is not at all 
necessary for our purpose to give a minute account of the 
way in which all this is done, but one or two facts should 
be strongly grasped. 
The child observes sense-objects, receives impressions, 
and these impressions or sensations are elaborated into 
perceptive ideas. These ideas are mental pictures of 
single, concrete, unrelated, things. 
Thus the child learns to know his toe, his thumb, his 
hand; his mother or nurse ; his rattle, his spoon, and many

our knowledge. This knowledge does not come through

THE ART OF STUDY. 
teaching or words. The child learns at first without 
other help than is furnished when those who minister to 
him put sensible objects before him in the manner that 
he can best understand. His only lessons are object 
lessons. This knowledge is slow, but it is sure; it is 
first-hand, original knowledge. The child is not dependent 
upon another for it, but gets it through the active ex- 
ercise of his own faculties. It originates in the contacts 
between his own mind and the surrounding world, and is 
real knowledge in the most vital sense of that term. This, 
no doubt, is a sufficient account of simple sense-percep- 
tion. It will be seen that at first the child makes his own 
knowledge with little help. 
The process of perception does not go very far before 
it is strongly reénforced by another process that is called 
Appercep- apperception. This word is composed of ad 
elon. meaning “to,” and percipere, meaning “ to see ” 
or “perceive,” and it expresses the well-known fact that 
new things are grasped with the help of old things, or new 
ideas are acquired by the way of old ideas. Thus, a child 
who has formed an idea of a familiar object, say a cat, is 
brought into contact with an unfamiliar object, say a dog. 
Immediately his faculties set to work to understand this 
new object, bringing it into relation with his idea of the 
old object, and never really leaving it until he has satis- 
fied himself that the two are alike or unlike; or, in other 
words, that they belong, or do not belong, to the same 
class. If the same idea or mental picture, somewhat 
changed, will not fit both objects, he must begin anew 
and form a new and independent idea of the new object. 
Interpretation and classification are thus both involved 
in apperception. Accordingly, our ideas once formed 
are in no sense dead, mechanical things, heaped up in 
 
-P-A-G-E-201
    METHODS OF LEARNING. 201 
the mind, but living powers that help us mightily in 
getting new ideas. Once an idea is brought into contact 
with new facts, things, or objects, it tends to promote the 
formation of ideas of these also. 
Two or three further explanations should be offered. 
A group of ideas through which the mind apperceives 
or interprets new experiences is called an apperceptive 
center or an apperceiving mass. 
In the process of apperception new facts or objects 
often become warped or distorted, that is, they are put 
vatueof in the same classes as old facts or objects, 
Appercep- differences being for the time being over- 
Hon. looked. The child who sees flakes of snow for 
the first time may call them butterflies, if he has already 
formed that idea; or, under similar conditions, he may 
call a snake a tail, or stalks of grass trees. Better ideas 
come with fuller experience and the frequent correction 
of error, The more nearly the new facts or objects are 
like the ideas making up the apperceiving mass, the nar- 
rower is the margin for error. But in spite of the fact 
that apperception is the source of many temporary or 
even permanent errors, it still accelerates the acquisition 
of knowledge to a prodigious degree. Without this 
power of the mind to assimilate one thing with another, 
we could never know very many things; while what little 
we did know would consist wholly of single and isolated 
ideas. Of things in classes or by classes we could know 
nothing whatever. 
A still more important fact has been implied, but it 
remains to be fully stated. This is the fact that apper- 
Gthiezal ception brings into the mind, or causes to 
Ideas. emerge in the mind, a new class of ideas. 
These are concepts, sometimes called general ideas, be-

  202 THE ART OF STUDY. 
cause they fit all the objects that make up the particular 
class. They are best understood when placed in contrast 
with percepts, which are ideas of simple, concrete things. 
There is some controversy about the origin of con- 
cepts. It answers our purposes, however, to know that 
they originate at this early stage of mind development, 
and that they are general in their nature. The meaning 
of it all is that the child who has reached this stage knows 
not only a cat, a spoon, a man, etc., but cat, spoon, 
man, as classes or species. Language marks the differ- 
ence between the two classes of ideas by assigning to per- 
cepts proper nouns or their equivalents, but to concepts 
common nouns. Justas soon asa child uses intelligently 
the plural number —just as soon as he knows the differ- 
ence between a man and men—he has passed from the 
stage of single ideas to the stage of general ideas; or 
from perceptive to conceptive knowledge. 
All, or nearly all, the intellectual processes are involved 
by implication in the formation of clear percepts and 
Comprehen- Concepts. Observation, or the examination of 
sivenessof objects; analysis, or the separation of a whole 
Ecopser intolite parts; synthesis, or the combination of 
parts into a whole ; memory, or the recalling of things once 
known; imagination, or the selection and combination of 
disconnected elements; comparison, or the discovery of 
likeness and unlikeness; judgment, or inference,—all are 
here. Some of them, however, are present in a very 
rudimentary form. It is not until a later stage of mental 
development that these elements fully declare them- 
selves. 
We shall now proceed to give a fuller examination 
of the processes of comparison and judgment, two very 
important steps in the attainment of knowledge.
-P-A-G-E-203
    METHODS OF LEARNING. 203 
In another chapter, much emphasis is laid upon the 
value of clear and precise ideas; it is there shown that 
Comparison SOUNd judgment and correct thinking are 
and Judg- strictly dependent upon such ideas. We must 
ae now look into the matter a little more closely. 
A single judgment is a comparison of two things or 
two ideas, or of one thing and one idea. When I lay a 
yardstick upon a piece of carpet to measure it, I compare 
things; when I apply to a certain path that I remember 
a measure that I carry in my mind, or measure the path 
mentally, I compare ideas; when I measure the path 
that is before me with a mental standard, I compare a 
thing and an idea. This tree is taller than that one; 
Elephants are sagacious beasts; This horse is an animal, 
are other examples. In respect to ideas, percept may be 
compared with percept, as “ The river isa mile wide ; ” con- 
cept with concept, as “ The dog is the companion of man ;” 
percept with concept, as “ This specimen is a star fish.” 
But all judgments are not affirmative judgments ; some 
are negative. Every judgment contains two parts— 
the two things that are compared; while Affirmative . : : 
andNeg- a judgment expressed in words is called a 
So proposition, which also consists of two parts. 
One of these two parts, whether of the judg- 
ment or of the proposition, is called the subject, or that 
of which something is said; the other the predicate, or 
that which is said of the subject; and these two parts 
are bound or coupled together by a copula, which is com- 
monly some form of the verb “to be.” In thought, all 
propositions can be reduced to one of two forms: A is B, 
or Ais not B. Properly speaking the judgment is the 
thought or soul that resides in the proposition, while 
the proposition is the body of this soul.
-P-A-G-E-204
    204 THE ART OF STUDY. 
Judgments are of two kinds, primary and secondary. 
They may also be called immediate and mediate, direct 
pate and indirect. In primary judgment the mind 
and Second- perceives and declares directly the agreement 
pone or disagreement of the two things compared. 
“ This tree is green,” “ This clothis not white,” 
are such judgments. In indirect judgment the mind 
circuitously discovers the agreement or the disagreement 
of two objects by comparing each of them with a third 
object, as will now be explained. 
Thinking proper isinferring, which means the derivation 
of anew judgment from old ones, or the carrying into a 
new judgment of what was contained in pre- 
Saaeeag * vious ones. Judgments reached by the way 
and of other judgments are the secondary or Deductive. . : : 
mediate judgments mentioned above. The 
derivation of such judgments is the province of proper 
thinking. Furthermore, thinking, or inference, is of two 
kinds, inductive and deductive, which will now be ex- 
plained. Moreover, while this is being done we shall see 
more clearly what is the real nature of thinking. Still 
it is quite impossible and unnecessary to go into the nice- 
ties of the subject. 
The nature of the two methods of thinking, or the two 
kinds of inference, and their relations to each other, can 
The be seen at once on examining a common syl- 
Syllogism. |ogism, which is the perfect type of deduction. 
We will take the following for an example: 
1. Iron pokers when heated to a certain degree become red hot ; 
2. This tool is an iron poker: 
3. Therefore this tool when so heated will become red hot. 
The first two propositions are called the premises, the 
third one the conclusion, of the argument. Now no man  
-P-A-G-E-205
  METHODS OF LEARNING. 205 
who accepts these premises will think of denying the 
third proposition. This is not at all because he has ex- 
amined, or proposes to examine this tool, when heated; 
the third proposition is a conclusion that follows or is in- 
ferred irresistibly from the other two. It is a secondary 
or thought-out judgment; that is, the tool is compared 
with red hot indirectly through the thing called iron. 
We may represent the process in symbols thus: 
All Bis A, 
All Cis B, 
All Cis A. 
C and A are compared by means of B. Deduction, it 
will be seen, is an inference from the general to the par- 
ticular. But the truth of the conclusion depends upon 
the truth of the premises; what they are worth the con- 
clusion is worth; no more and no less. But what is the 
origin of these premises. How do we know that they are 
true? To be definite, how do we know that all iron 
pokers when heated to the prescribed degree become red 
hot? To answer this question we must consider the 
other method of thought; that is, induction? 
I have observed that all the pokers which I have seen 
heated to a certain degree have become red hot; 
Induction. hence I infer that whenever this one is so 
heated it will become red hot. Again, I have observed 
1“ The word ‘inference,’ ” says Mr. Fowler, “is employed in no less than 
three different senses. It is sometimes used to express the conclusion in 
conjunction with the premise or premises from which it is derived, as when 
we speak of a syllogism or an induction as an inference; sometimes it is 
used to express the conclusion alone ; sometimes the process by which the 
conclusion is derived from the premises, as when we speak of induction or 
deduction as inferences, or inferential processes.”— The Elements of Deduct: 
ive Logic. Oxford, The Clarendon Press, 1871, p. 65,
-P-A-G-E-206
  206 THE ART OF STUDY. 
the same thing of numerous other pieces of iron; hence 
Tinfer that all pieces of iron so heated become red hot. 
Furthermore, people who have had experience with 
heated iron tell me the same thing. Their experience 
confirms my experience. Accordingly, I am so very pos- 
itive that this proposition or reasoned judgment is true 
that I call it a general fact or a law of nature, unless, in- 
deed, some new cause shall come into play that will 
prevent the poker becoming red hot. 
But why am I at liberty to infer from the few instances 
in which I have seen this poker become red hot that it 
will always do so under the same circum- 
stances? Or why may I conclude that what I 
have observed of several pieces of iron is true 
of the pieces which I have not observed? This question 
lies aside from our path, and it suffices to say that my 
right to make the inference depends upon the uniformity 
of nature; that is, the law that under the same circum- 
stances the same cause produces the same effects. More- 
over, every valid induction involves two steps or stages. 
One is the observation of particular objects or facts; the 
other the inference from these particular facts of a general 
truth or proposition, which may be variously called a defini. 
tion, arule, a principle, a general truth, oralaw. Induction, 
then, is an inference from particulars to generals or univer- 
sals, as deduction is an inference from generals or universals 
to particulars. In other words, induction leads to new gen- 
eral truths; deduction, through the combination of two 
propositions, developsa third which they contain between 
them. Induction leaves off where deduction begins, and the 
two together make up the one complete method of thought. 
But what about the second premise of the syllogism ? 
This, too, happens to be a mediate proposition or judg- Two Steps in 
Induction.

ment, or one reached by a previous deduction. That is, 
Originor 1 have learned (1) by induction that a body 
the Second having such and such properties is iron ; (2) by 
Premise. — immediate observation that the body before me 
has these properties; and (3) conclude, or infer, accord- 
ingly, that it is iron. 
Deductive inferences assume many different forms, 
some of them quite puzzling; but it is not at all neces- 
sary that we should consider these forms in or- Abridgment

that such arguments are not always, or indeed 
generally, stated at full length, but if they are legitimate 
arguments they may be so stated. Take the reply that 
Jesus made to his tempters when they demanded that he 
should show them a sign from heaven. “He answered 
and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It will be 
fair weather, for the sky is red. And in the morning, It 
will be foul weather to-day, for the sky is red and lower- 
ing.” This brief passage can be readily expanded into 
two syllogisms by supplying the omitted major premises. 
First syllogism :— 
1, A red sky at evening betokens fair weather; 
2. The sky is red this evening: 
3. Therefore to-morrow will be a fair day. 
Second syllogism :— 
1, A red and lowering sky in the morning points to a foul day; 
2. It is red and lowering this morning: 
3. Therefore the day will be foul. 
The major premise thus supplied in either case depends 
upon observation and inference. It is an induction. It 
sums up the experience of men under the existing con- 
ditions. The minor premise in either case is the result of
-P-A-G-E-208
  j 
208 THE ART OF STUDY, 
an immediate act of observation. It is an original prop- 
osition. The conclusions are valid within the limits of 
the premises. Often, however, the minor premise is also 
an induction. 
It is accordingly clear that induction is a method of 
discovery ; a method by which new general truths are 
Naddetion a Gotapls meee That is, we take the facts that 
Method of observation and experiment furnish, and induct- 
Discovery. ively infer from them general conclusions. In 
this way the laws of nature, and many other laws, are 
established. Induction stores up the experience of men 
in general propositions, rules, maxims, principles, or laws 
where it can be made serviceable. 
It is quite as plain, on the other hand, that it is de- 
duction which reduces these truths so stored up to 
practice. For illustration, we may refer to the phy- 
sician in the sick room, the sanitary engineer, the mer- 
chant, the general in the field, the teacher in 
Deduction a ; 
Method of the schoolroom, the man of practice wherever 
Re you find him. The process by which the phy- 
. sician discovers a disease from which a patient 
is suffering, or makes a diagnosis of it as the professional 
saying is, is simply this: He has learned from his own ex- 
perience and the experience of others that a certain group 
of symptoms means consumption, a second group typhoid 
fever, etc. ; he discovers by an examination of his patient 
that one of these groups of symptoms is present in whole 
or part; and so he infers that the trouble is the disease 
that produces this group of symptoms. The process 
may be thus exhibited: 
1, Such and such symptoms mean typhoid fever ; 
2. This patient has these symptoms: 
3. Therefore this patient has typhoid fever.  
-P-A-G-E-209

Again, as induction is a method of discovery, so deduc- 
tion isa method of practical application, and the two to- 
gether make up the one complete method of thought. 
But it is time to return to the child. As we have seen, 
his first knowledge is a knowledge of facts born of his 
mveuita | OND experience. He observes objects, tries 
an Original Vatious experiments upon them, forms per- 
Discoverer. cepts, brings apperception to reinforce percep- 
tion, compares one thing with another, and finally reaches 
some very loose and indefinite generalizations. His per- 
ceptions as well as his generalizations are more or less 
incorrect and false, but he corrects or rectifies them by 
further observation, experiment, and inference. There 
is no mistaking the road on which he travels. The young 
child groping about. in his dark world to find out the 
meaning of things proceeds inductively, just as does 
the trained man of science,—the chemist, the astron- 
omer, or the biologist,—standing upon the confines of 
knowledge and seeking to make new discoveries. What 
the child is doing is to store up experience, that is, facts 
and ideas, by which he may interpret and understand 
the world. He is a learner who is doing original work. 
Those who have charge of him turn his mind to this ob- 
ject or to that by placing it before him and thus teach 
him indirectly ; but to all intents and purposes he is a 
solitary worker, groping his way out into the world alone. 
He cannot take things at second-hand, or upon authority, 
but he must find them out for himself. Thus he makes 
his own knowledge without other assistance than is shown 
in the selection of his environment. 
But deduction does not lag far behind. It is in fact 
implicitly involved in apperception. In this process the 
ideas that the child has formed are deductively applied

the butterfly, the serpent with the tail. He assumes that 
things which are alike belong to the same class. 
We have seen that the child’s first tuition is wholly 
negative. He is taught by his tutors only through the se- 
The Method lection and combination of the objects that are 
of Secona- put in his way. We are dealing, of course, 
edge. with the material world. Words to the young 
child are but sounds, not language; they convey no 
meaning. But, progressively, language becomes significant 
to him, which means that he now begins to enjoy 
direct tuition. He is still taught indirectly through his 
environment as before; but his tutors, as his mother and 
other members of the family, greatly facilitate his knowl- 
edge of things by explaining them to him as well as they 
are able. Still more, in due time, he is told about things 
that he has never seen or heard of, and that lie wholly 
beyond his sphere of observation. He is told things that 
he has had no part in finding out, and various means are 
employed to cause him to understand them. Pictures 
are shown him, or he is told that these unseen things 
are like such and such things that he hasseen. Ina sense, 
this is second-hand knowledge to the child ; he takes it from 
another, and soon authority. It comes from a quarter that 
he has not explored and that he may be incapable of explor- 
ing. Moreover, what he is told will be helpful or harmful to 
him according as it fits into what he knows already. If it 
is sufficiently like what he knows, he will learn something 
useful ; but, if not, the effort will be worse than thrown 
away. It is only through the facts and ideas he already 
 
-P-A-G-E-211
  METHODS OF LEARNING. 211 
has that he can understand new facts and ideas, which 
brings us back to apperception. Thus a child who has 
learned directly what a dog is will get some idea of a wolf 
when he is told that a wolf is an animal like adog. This 
is a critical time in the child’s mental development — 
the time when his tutors begin to fit into his narrow 
experience some of their broader experience. 
Now what is the method of thought that the child fol- 
lows in acquiring second-hand knowledge? Obviously 
the same that he employed in acquiring first-hand knowl- 
edge. At first, words spoken within his hearing are but 
sound or noise, signifying nothing. But in time the child 
learns to listen to what he hears, and seeks to find out 
its meaning. He connects certain sounds with certain 
visual or audible objects; he correlates gestures and other 
forms of expression with words; he puts this and that 
together, slowly, patiently, and with many a blunder, 
until he begins to spell out the meaning of oral language. 
This is a part of the process by which 
ne The manikin feels his way 
Out from the shore of the great unknown, 
Blind, and wailing, and alone, 
Into the light of day.” 
The end is discovery, the method is induction. Still 
deduction begins as soon as a fair beginning has been 
made. The first ideas are used apperceptively, and 
through the door of apperception deductionenters. The 
child interprets what he hears, and interpretation, when 
once a beginning has been made, is mainly deductive. 
Concepts, rules, principles, as fast as they are acquired, 
are used to solve new problems. The completed process 
of apperception in the realm of secondary knowledge 
may be analyzed as follows:  
-P-A-G-E-212
  212 THE ART OF STUDY. 
1. Any animal that resembles a dog in such and such particulars 
is a wolf; 
2, This description or picture presents these resemblances : 
3. Therefore it is a description or a picture of a wolf. 
The third proposition is inferred from the other two; 
the second is the result of an immediate observation. The 
concept dog is part of the child’s first-hand knowledge, 
but the fact that wolf is the name of the animal bearing 
the resemblance to the dog is taken at second-hand, or on 
authority, as indeed is the fact that there is such an 
animal as a wolf. 
No one can tell at what time this fitting of second-hand 
knowledge to first-hand knowledge begins. It differs in 
different children, and all we can say is that it begins just 
as soon as the mother or other tutor is able to impart to 
the child any bit of knowledge through language of any 
kind. But in every case it antedates the child’s ar- 
rival in the schoolroom or even in the kindergarten. It 
is, as said above, a critical time in the child’s mental devel- 
opment. In the larger sense, it is the beginning of his 
tuition. Let us see more fully what it really involves. 
So far we have dealt mainly with the natural world. 
But there is a living social world as well, —a world of men 
/thesociat 21d women, — and it is quite as important that 
World. the child shall understand this social world as 
that he shall understand the natural one. The child, in 
other words, is a social being, and he must become ad- 
justed to the social world about him. ‘The men and 
women who constitute this world are all thinking, feeling, 
and doing, and he can be efficient, helpful, and happy only 
as he learns to codperate with them. The meaning of 
this, in the field of labor, is that he shall help them while 
‘they help him, or serve them while they serve him; and  
-P-A-G-E-213
  METHODS OF LEARNING. 213 
so with respect to education, morals, politics, and re- 
ligion, The individual is a part of the social whole, and 
his strength lies in his codperation with that whole. It is 
no exaggeration to say that, to a degree, he must codperate 
or perish ; he has no choice in the premises ; but the extent 
to which he does his own work and becomes efficient in 
the world depends upon the completeness of such codper- 
ation. If he codperates but feebly, he is, comparatively. 
speaking, weak, helpless, useless, and miserable. 
Nor is this all; there is an historic human world as well as 
a living one. For thousands of years men have been accu- 
tne His- Mulating knowledge in the form of facts, ideas, 
toric World. Jaws of nature and of society, and rules of con- 
duct. This accumulation is the store of human experi- 
ence that descends, increasing as it goes, from generation 
to generation. It represents the opportunities and striv- 
ings, the successes and failures, the thoughts and deeds 
of men, so far as these have been preserved. It is the 
garnered wealth of civilization, which, educationally con- 
sidered, is one of the three great sources of culture- 
material that are accessible to men, the other two being 
the natural world and the living world of human society. 
The historic world and this living world may be called 
the one world of ‘humanity under two aspects. Now the 
child at birth is just as ignorant of the historic world as 
he is of the natural and social worlds. Moreover, it is 
almost as important that he shall become acquainted 
with history as that he shall become acquainted with 
nature and society. This means that he shall early be in- 
troduced to the garnered store of human experience, and 
shall come to know it as thoroughly as possible; for, if 
he is to remain separated from it as he is at birth, which 
is indeed to a great degree impossible, he must begin life

as though he were the first human being in the world, 
having everything to learn for himself. To be in league 
with history, — to join hands with the men and women of 
the past, —- is to enter into a still larger codperation with 
the human world than is possible by merely being in 
league with the society of to-day. And, moreover, it is 
a more difficult adjustment to make. 
How then shall suitable connections between the child 
and the social and historic worlds be effected? Here 
are two questions, and we shall deal with them in the 
order in which they occur. 
The social world presents to the child very different 
materials or facts from those that Nature presents. 
How the The methods of acquirement, however, are the 
ee same. The child begins with observing the 
Social simple, concrete human facts right about him — 
prenits the acts of mother, nurse, or of any other per- 
sons who make up the little social world in which he lives— 
and from this small beginning he passes to the larger social 
world about him. Perception is followed by appercep- 
tion, percepts by concepts, observation by comparison and 
judgment, and these again by thought and generalization. 
As in the world of nature, so here, the child begins alone, 
a solitary investigator, since none can render him any as- 
sistance save in the indirect and negative way of throwing 
facts before him. Soon, however, he learns to take social 
facts, like natural facts, at second-hand, or on authority. 
Thus, in the simple contacts of the nursery and the home 
the child’s education in social adaptation, in politics and 
in morals begins. The steps are precisely the same as 
they are in the natural world, and are taken in the same 
order. 
In a word, the child learns the laws of the social world

in the same way that he learns the laws of the natural 
Observation WOrld. And so it is with the rules, maxims, 
ene Induc- and proverbs that embody and perpetuate the 
3 practical or prudential wisdom that the race 
accumulates. In this way he comes to such generaliza- 
tions as these : “ The fool and his money are soon parted ;” 
“ Honesty is the best policy ;” “Despotism tends to cor- 
rupt the people ;” “Freedom tends to national strength 
and prosperity ;” ‘“ Experience is a dear school, but fools 
will learn inno,other;” “ Barking dogs never bite.” The . 
familiar saying of Francis Bacon, “ Reading maketh a 
full man, writing a correct man, and discourse a fluent 
man,” contains three such generalizations. These rules 
and maxims may have many exceptions, but they flow 
from observation and experience and serve a very useful 
practical purpose. Tt is perfectly plain that the process 
by which these generalizations are reached is induction, 
using that term in a sense broad enough to include the 
collecting of data. 
But, while the laws and rules relating to the existing 
social world are reached and proved by induction, they 
Deduction are applied to particular cases, or reduced to 
ela practice, by means of deduction. A man learns 
by experience to associate such and such quali- 
ties or acts with dishonesty; he observes that Mr. A. has 
these qualities, or performs these acts, and therefore in- 
fers that he is dishonest. This isa pure syllogism. Every 
adult person performs scores of such acts of reasoning as 
this every day of his life. 
While it is more difficult for the child to effect a union 
with the historic world than with the living, social world, 
the method is the same. In one sense he cannot himself 
observe the facts of history, because these occur once and

historic. But the child may observe, and does observe, 
his own acts and the acts of others, which differ in no es- 
sential feature from historic facts, and which are con- 
stantly passing into history. One of the great merits of 
Comenius, the educational reformer, was that he demon- 
strated how all the great departments of knowledge have 
their beginnings in the experiences of infant life. ‘“ The 
beginning of history,” he said, “ will be to remember what 
was done yesterday, what recently, what a year ago, what 
two or three years ago.” Similarly, “the child’s first in- 
struction in chronology will be to know what is an hour, 
a day, a week, a month, a year; what is spring, summer, 
etc.” 1 As respects the past, the child must take his facts 
at second-hand, upon authority. He will find them at 
first in the tales told by his seniors, but later in books and 
other historical records, His own observation gives him 
a store of apperceiving material. He interprets the oral 
reports that come to him of what has been by his own 
experience of what is, and he reads his book by the light 
of such experience, and of the knowledge that he receives 
by word of mouth. Thus, both oral tradition and written 
documents become the child’s teacher, spreading before 
him the lessons of the past. 
The processes of induction and deduction act upon 
historic facts just as they do upon other facts. From 
historic data the child learns to derive general proposi-

tions, and then to apply these propositions to new cases, 
just as in dealing with the facts of direct personal ex- 
perience. Induction and deduction, as before, make up 
the one complete method of thought. 
We have devoted some space to explaining how the 
child learns. His methodsare precisely the methods that 
unity of he will use in after life. Still more, these 
Methods. methods are essentially the same in respect to 
all subjects. It is important to emphasize these two 
facts, for many persons seem to associate induction and de- 
duction with philosophers and men of science, never dream- 
ing that the child or the ordinary man is capable of per- 
forming such daring mental feats. There are differences 
in respect to the facts used, or in respect to the greater or 
less perfect application of the method, but nothing more. 
For example, a writer commenting upon “ the wonderful 
intuition” of the Indian of the great fur land of the 
North, which enables him to forego the advantage to 
be derived from a compass, and yet rarely to miss his 
way, says: “The trees he knows were all bent to the 
south, and the branches on that side were larger and 
stronger than on the north, as was also the moss.” It is 
indeed by these signs, among others,that the ignorant sav- 
age chooses his way, but there is no “intuition” about 
it. By induction, based on repeated observations, he 
comes to the conclusions that the trees on the wind-swept 
plain, as a class, lean to the south, etc., and these gen- 
eralizations, by pure process of deduction, enable him 
to adjust himself to all the points of the compass.

  CHAPTER XX. 
METHODS OF TEACHING. 
THE preceding chapter was devoted to an exposition 
of the methods of learning as brief as seemed consistent 
with clearness. We are now to consider the bear- 
ing of this exposition upon the art of study and the art 
of teaching. The answers to the questions implied areas 
direct and plain as they are important. 
First, the art of study is but a mode of learning and 
conforms to the same general method. It is true that we 
ncias'a have confined our definition of study to books, 
sredeot which lie in the field of secondary knowledge; 
Learning. byt the methods by which the contents of 
books are appropriated by the mind have also been ex- 
plained as not differing essentially from those employed 
in the acquisition of the knowledge of things. Moreover, 
we have kept real knowledge and the use of the senses 
continually in view, as giving support to the more refined 
processes of the book. 
Secondly, teaching must conform in general to the 
same methods as learning. The teacher, to be successful, 
weachingto Must take his method from the pupil. If the 
Spring from teacher’s method of teaching is not the 
CES pupil’s method of learning, the two will work 
at cross-purposes, and little progress will be made. From 
this main fact some important rules of teaching follow. 
219
-P-A-G-E-220
  220 THE ART OF STUDY. 
The first of these rules is that induction and deduction 
should be judiciously combined in teaching, from first to 
last. In one sense the teacher has no option Induction | : and Deduc- in the premises, since induction and deduction 
eesea. are laws of the human mind that cannot be set 
aside. Still, the teacher may fail in combina- 
tion, using one method where the other should be em- ployed, or in emphasizing one at the expense of the other. 
The second rule is that the ratio of combination must 
fluctuate as the studies, the pupil’s stage of progress, and 
The Ratio the end that the teacher has in view fluctuate. 
ae This rule, which involves much difficulty in its 
Fluctuates. application, demands, in consequence, a some- 
what full elucidation. 
In the early stages of school instruction the method of 
real knowledge, — observation, experiment, and induction 
Induction ~~Should be made prominent. As yet the comes child has not accumulated either a large stock First. of apperceiving material with which to inter- 
pret second-hand knowledge, or worked out a large num- 
ber of laws, rules, maxims, for use in practical life. He 
is engaged in learning at first hand the two worlds 
about him,—~ nature and society. But he is also receiving 
knowledge at second-hand, which he assimilates by means 
of his own observation and thought. Furthermore, he is 
learning the great art of the school, the art of reading, 
and by means of this instrument, also, he augments his 
store of second-hand knowledge. 
Now the teacher may strive to make his oral instruc- 
tion mainly inductive, putting facts before general ideas, 
Deduction and the author of the text-book may have the 
Follows. same aim in view, but it is not possible to make 
either form of instruction as objective as lessons upon ob- 
 
-P-A-G-E-221
  METHODS OF TEACHING. 221 
jects or lessons drawn from nature may be made. Theacts 
by which the mind primarily interprets language, oral or 
written, are essentially deductive, as was shown in the last 
chapter. The same may be said of pictures and other 
illustrations that appeal to the senses. It will, perhaps, 
be said that deduction also plays a part in the formation 
of new ideas of natural objects, but this is not the case to 
the same extent as when language is the medium of in- 
struction. It is also to be observed that book instruction 
is more deductive and formal than oral instruction. 
It is, therefore, clear that induction will be less promi- 
nent, deduction more prominent, in education the greater 
ekecaees the dependence that is placed upon books and 
ofFormal- formal study. An education that is drawn 
peetaiie. mainly from books almost of necessity becomes 
bookish, abstract, and formal. To counteract 
this strong tendency recourse has been had to various 
agencies. 
The most important of these agencies is real or ob- 
jective teaching. Comenius, in modern times, pointed 
Ovjective out that the way to free education from the 
Teaching. bondage of the book was to go back to nature. 
He demanded: 
“Do we not dwell in the Garden of Eden as well as our predeces- 
sors? Why should not we use our eyes, and ears, and noses as well 
as they; and why need we other teachers than these in learning to 
know the works of nature? Why should we not, instead of these 
dead books, open to the children the living book of Nature? Why 
not open their understanding to the things themselves, so that from 
them, as from living springs, many streamlets may flow?” ? 
The stress that is now laid upon scientific teaching, and 
particularly laboratory methods, is a part of the great

-P-A-G-E-222
THE ART OF STUDY, 
educational movement that Comenius had so much to 
do with inaugurating. 
A second means of overcoming the formalism of book 
instruction is oral teaching. While it is true that the 
Oral process of interpretation is deductive, the oral 
Teaching. method, notwithstanding its own defects, tends 
strongly to relieve the book of its formalism and to keep 
teaching from degenerating into mere word cramming. 
But nobody has ever proposed to throw aside books 
as instruments of teaching and discipline. Sucha proposi- 
Inductive tion would involve cutting the child off, in great 
Text-books. degree, from the past. It would involve the 
renunciation of the major part of civilization, and would 
bea long step towards barbarism. The book must be re- 
tained —to this allagree. Educators really differ on only 
two points — the extent to which the book shall be used, 
and the manner in which it shall be used. Attempts to 
answer this second question, have led to a third device 
for overcoming the defects of book teaching, viz.: induct- 
ive text-books, or text-books written according to the 
inductive method. The characteristic feature of these 
books is not that deduction is thrown wholly aside, in- 
duction being madeallinall, but it consists rather in the or- 
der in which the two methods are used, and the relative 
stress laid upon each, 
Less than fifty years ago text-books on arithmetic 
were prepared on the deductive plan. The author began 
with definitions, proceeded to rules, and closed 
Beads with examples and problems. Few illustra- 
andGram- tions of the rules were given, and there was 
a little explanation of methods. Arithmetic was 
thus made as abstract and formal as it could be, con- 
crete elements being found only in the examples and 
 
-P-A-G-E-223
  METHODS OF TEACHING. 223 
problems. The pupil ordinarily passed by the definitions 
and took up the rules. By dint of effort and such as- 
sistance as he received from the teacher or at home, he 
learned “to do the sums,” as the phrase was, which 
fell under the rules. Study was almost wholly me- 
chanical. When a group of miscellaneous examples was 
reached, the pupil did not so much seek to handle them 
according to their nature as he strove to find rules that 
would fit them. If the proper answers were obtained, 
the assumption was that the work was correct. Of course, 
there were exceptions to this plan of procedure. 
The same description will apply to the books on gram- 
mar. The order of study was definitions, rules, and prac- 
tice in parsingand analysis. But parsing and analysis are 
purely deductive processes. For example: 
1, All names are nouns; 
2. John is a name: 
3. Therefore John is a noun, 
This method was pursued until the last “ property” 
of the word had been disposed of and the final “ rule” 
of syntax been applied. If possible, the grammar 
was even more formal than the arithmetic. The geog- 
raphy and history, when there was any history, were less 
abstract, because they are not thought-studies but fact- 
studies. Still, they were taught wholly from books, as was 
also the little science that found its way into the schools. 
It is easy to see how men came to write such books as 
these, and to teach in such a fashion. For one thing, the 
SOE Bee ss most convenient method of discourse or teach- 
duce Such ing is not the method of discovery. The dis-

feels justified in summing them up in a general state-

ment or proposition. He now wishes to impart to 
others what he has learned, and, instead of repeating the 
steps that he has taken, as a discoverer, slowly adding fact 
to fact, he begins with stating the general proposition that 
contains all that he has found out, and then, if he thinks 
it necessary, he gives one or two facts to illustrate his 
meaning. By this process generalizations are put before 
facts or instances. 
This is precisely what the authors of the old arith- 
metics and grammars did, only they often failed to add 
explanatory examples, or to add them in sufficient num- 
ber. It was the same way with teaching. The result 
was the formalism and barrenness that marked such 
schools as those described by Horace Mann and Francis 
Wayland on previous pages. 
The new inductive books and inductive teaching under- 
take to bring the method of instruction back to the 
Inductive method of discovery. The author of one of 
Arithmetics the new arithmetics begins with an operation, and Gram- : Neva: or what teachers sometimes call “work.” He 
repeats the operation a second, and a third 
time; he gives similar examples that the pupil may repeat 
it for himself; and then, when the process has been well 
mastered, he sums up the whole in a rule or method, and 
gives some additional examples for the pupil to work out 
in order that the process may be well fixed in his mind. 
An arithmetical rule, it may be observed, is simply a his- 
tory or account of what is done in performing a typical 
example falling under the rule. Such is also the method 
of the new grammar. Instead of beginning with defini- 
tions of parts of speech, properties, etc., and advancing to 
tules of etymology and syntax, the writer of the book 
begins rather with language itself, and from his investiga- 
 
-P-A-G-E-225
  METHODS OF TEACHING. 225 
tion of sentences and words works out the rules and defini- 
tions. As before, the abstract elements follow the concrete. 
It may seem difficult to exaggerate the importance of 
the new step in education which is involved in the read- 
5 justment of induction and deduction, and in xaggera- i 
tion of the larger employment of oral teaching. It 
Induction. Was really the first step in the path of the new 
education. Still, the importance of this step as been 
exaggerated. Authors and teachers have sometimes lost 
sight of the fact that deduction is an essential part of the 
one method of thought; that in teaching it is not always 
the best way to repeat all the steps taken in the discovery 
of knowledge, since doing so involves a great waste of time 
and labor ; and that inductive teaching itself may also be 
made formal. As respects the waste of time and labor, it 
is the same thing as waste of opportunity and of knowl- 
edge. 
We have seen that it is by means of deduction that the 
individual who is prepared for such a step enters into the 
Resultsof great inheritance that his predecessors have 
ane prepared for him, or, in other words, joins 
Methods. hands with the historic world. It is necessary, 
of course, that he shall gather sufficient apperceiving 
material by his own personal efforts to enable him to effect 
a union with the past. But, beyond this, he need not go 
for the purposes of the practical life. To insist upon be- 
ginning at the beginning in everything ; to cause the child 
to trudge along the long inductive road; to be satisfied 
with nothing short of his learning everything by his own 
individual effort, means that the child must be cut off from 
the past altogether and live wholly in the present. More 
than this, insistence upon such a course would cut the 
child off from his own contemporaries as well as his pred-

ecessors and leave him alone, to perish in the world. 
Fortunately, the thing is practically impossible. But at 
the same time it is not difficult to go to such a length on 
this road that serious loss of time and effort will be incurred 
with the necessary consequence of loss of knowledge. 
Hence, it is the part of wisdom to make use of the 
“short-cuts’’ rather than to keep to the inductive road. 
It may be added that knitting together the new and the 
old, adjusting the individual to the world, is essential 
to the very conception of history. To effect such an 
adjustment is one of the prime objects of education. Its 
attainment lies partly within and partly without the school. 
The methods by which this adjustment must be effected 
have no doubt been explained at sufficient length. We 
may dismiss the topic with a few sentences quoted froma 
writer who has investigated it with much ability : 
“Pedagogy might be defined as the art of adapting new genera- 
tions to those conditions of life which are the most intensive and 
me vincent fruitful for the individual and the species. . . . From ‘this 
on “§hort- point of view, the educational function may be described, 
Cuts.” though possibly not defined, as a purposeful social effort to 
effect ‘ short-cuts’ in the mental development of the individual as well 
as to hasten the whole process so that he may, in the briefest time, and 
ina thoroughly natural way, attain the standpoint of the race... 
The‘ short-cut ’ theory in its extreme form relies upon deduction. It 
would save the time consumed in reaching generalizations. These, 
formulated by the race, should be transferred at once to the individual 
in order that society may advance in knowledge. . . . In the earlier 
period chief emphasis may be laid on induction, but with the growth 
of self-activity and consciousness, deductive ‘ short-cuts’ may be eco- 
nomically introduced,” + 
Besides its value for practical direction, what has now

been said is an answer to the demand that the individual, 
in his education, shall throughout repeat the history of 
mhetnai. the race, and learn everything by experience. 
vidualand For atime, the child must absolutely conform to 
the Bece::'! this order, but after a time he should not, and 
in fact cannot, save in a limited degree. In other words, 
he learns to take the deductive short-cuts in education; 
furthermore, to refuse them entails infinite waste and is a 
virtual denial that man isa social being. In the words 
of Professor L. F. Ward: 
“Nothing is calculated more forcibly to impress upon us the 
conviction that the mass of mankind must get their knowledge through 
instruction and not through experience, nor yet through personal ob- 
servation and research, than to note how such great minds as those of 
Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, Bacon, and Newton groped about in 
darkness and doubt respecting the questions of planetary revolution, 
tides, gravitation, light, etc., with which every schoolboy is now 
familiar.” 1 
It is therefore evident that the teacher, for the sake of 
both knowledge and discipline, should employ induction 
and deduction from the beginning of the child’s Both Induc- 3 a

himself, but other things he should be told. 
He should find out some things for himself, because there 
is no other way for him to find them out, and because this 
is the way leading to the teachings of human experience. 
He should be taught other things, because he would not 
be able to find them out, or could find them out only by a 
wasteful expenditure of time and effort. But what things 
shall he find out; what things shall he be told? No

formal answer can be made to these questions ; each case 
must bedecided on its own merits. However, two serious 
mistakes have been made in attempting an answer. 
One of these is the mistake made by the old -authors 
and teachers in making teaching too formal, too bookish, 
too deductive. The other mistake is of a di- 
rectly opposite character. The child is kept 
“ finding out” things that he already knows, or 
things that he had better be told. There is too much ob- 
servation and induction. We have been told that a child 
should never be told anything that he can find out for 
himself. Even Pestalozzi said we should read nothing, 
discover everything. No man has ever brought up a 
child in accordance with these precepts ; no man will ever 
do so, because it is impossible. These precepts are gross 
exaggerations of the important truths that the child 
should not be told, and should not read, too many things, 
but should be led to exercise his own powers of observa- 
tionand thought. Ido not need to measure the Michigan 
Central Railroad from Ann Arbor to Chicago to find the 
distance between these points, because others have already 
measured it much better than I can do, while the greater 
sense of “reality” that I should have in doing it myself 
would be no compensation for the time and money that it 
would cost me. But I do need to measure enough distances 
to learn the process called “ measuring,” and the value of 
different measures or standards. Such knowledge as this 
can come only by personal experience. Moreover, such 
experience saves the pupil from that “ facile use of words 
without ideas” which has been called “ the clatter of ma- 
chinery in a factory in which raw materials are scanty and 
poor.” Itis only too easy to tell children too much, but it 
is not mending matters to refuse to tell them anything Abuses of 
Induction. 
 
-P-A-G-E-229
   
    METHODS OF TEACHING. 229 
that they can find out for themselves. Investigation is a 
great instrument of teaching, but it may be, and sometimes 
is, overdone. Teachers of physics in high schools, for 
example, are already recoiling from the extreme to which 
teaching by experiment was at one time carried, and 
are placing more stress upon the formal elements of 
a good text-book. They find that the experimental 
method tends to overvalue raw facts, and to under- 
value those principles and laws which constitute the 
framework of the science. Sir J. G. Fitch tells the story 
of an English teacher who, to show the interest of his 
scholars in science, spoke of their fondness for the chem- 
istry of the explosive substances. But interest in the 
explosive substances does not necessarily show an interest 
in chemistry. Back of phenomena, such as explosions, lie 
the ideas that give the science its character, and science 
can never be fully understood until these ideas have been 
considered under both their inductive and deductive rela- 
tions. One merit of the Herbartian analysis of the 
teaching process is the fact that application, the last 
of the formal steps, is wholly deductive. 
Perhaps some readers of this chapter who are teachers 
will ask for more definite directions as to the manner in 
which they shall take the “ short-cuts” in their instruc- 
tion. The demand is a fair one and easily met. 
It is not necessary always to follow the rule: Put 
the facts before the principle, the operation before the 
“gacts Be. method. The time comes in the pupil’s pro- 
fore Princi- gress when that order may be, and should be, 
Dre aoe reversed, with such recurrence to the former 
aaples order as may be necessary to keep knowl- 
edge fully alive. In this way the pupil’s time and 
strength will be saved. However, this change should  
-P-A-G-E-230

not be made until the pupil has acquired as much 
knowledge and mental capacity as will enable him to 
grasp a general statement and, at least with proper illus- 
trations, to understand and even to apply it. In general, 
it is best to follow the inductive plan in teaching arith- 
metic and grammar in common schools. Geometry, too, 
may be approached on the concrete or inventional side ; 
but geometry, like algebra, is properly a deductive science, 
and must be taught as such or much of its educational 
value will be sacrificed. Again, the best teachers of 
physics do not now lead their pupils to extract the general 
ideas that constitute the science from the experiments 
of the laboratory. They give them, progressively, these 
ideas in book or lecture, and then send them to the 
laboratory to test and establish them. They very prop- 
erly assume that the pupils know enough of the physical 
qualities of things toenable them to make a beginning. 
At this stage of progress the teacher is careful to keep 
the doctrine fully abreast, and sometimes even a little 
ahead, of the experiments; but at an earlier time this 
would be bad teaching. It is folly, as one author has 
said, to set the learner “to rediscovering the laws of 
physics.” He adds: 
“ Before the pupil is in any degree fit to investigate a subject ex- 
perimentally, he must have a clearly defined idea of what he is doing, 
an outfit of principles and data to guide him, and a good degree of 
skill in conducting an investigation.” 
Closely connected with this topic is another one — the 
relation of the word and the idea. In the earliest stage 
of learning the order is, first the object, then the idea, 
then the word. This is a strictly necessary order; the 
child can proceed in no other way. But in course of
-P-A-G-E-231

time the order of the series may be reversed; ideas may 
be given before objects, words may even come before 
‘cpirst the ideas. Now some enthusiastic souls have 
Idea, then gone so far on the objective road as to tell 
ian oe us that the early order should always be fol-

the idea, the language never before the thought. This 
dictum is an exaggeration of a very valuable idea, and is 
as impossible of application as is the dictum never to tell 
the child anything that he can find out for himself. At 
one stage of progress this rule is to be closely followed, and 
at no stage of progress is it to be forgotten ; but there 
are times when the inverse order of the terms of the 
series——facts, ideas, words—should be followed. For one, 
I am sure that I knew the word “boomerang” be- 
fore I knew the idea, and I am not sure that I have 
seen the thing even yet. What is more, I have never 
suffered any loss because I acquired first the word and 
then the idea, although under some circumstances I might 
have done so.

  CHAPTER XXI. 
FORMAL TEACHING OF THE ART OF STUDY. 
IT was pointed out in an early chapter of this work 
that the phrase “art of study,” like the term “ art,” stands 
gTwo Stages fortwothings. First, it means skill or acquired 
eae Art ofaptitude in study. Secondly, it means this 
. skill or acquired aptitude itself as a subject of 
study. In the first case, we have an activity that con- 
stitutes art in the primitive, original sense of the term; in 
the second case, we have the rules or the methods to which 
such activity conforms. The first may be called practical 
art, the second formal or reflective art. The art of study 
in the one sense is exemplified by pupils in school rooms ; 
in the other sense it is treated in books and lectures as 
a subject of instruction or discourse. It is clear, there- 
fore, that this art, like every other art, presents to our 
minds two stages—the stage of practice and the stage 
of study, which may, indeed, overlap. 
So far we have been dealing with the first of these two 
stages. It is true enough that some rules have been laid 
Practicat “Own and that much has been said about 
Stagesofar method; but this has been done solely for the 
Considered. i formation and guidance of the teacher, not for 
the immediate use of the pupil. This instruction will 
beuseful to the pupil in the second stage of progress, 
232 
 
-P-A-G-E-233
FORMAL TEACHING OF ART OF STUDY. 233 
that is, when he begins to study his art. Such matter 
will not, however, help, but rather hinder, him in the 
first stage of progress. It cannot be too strongly asserted 
that the pupil must learn to study by actually studying, 
just as he must learn any other art by actually practicing 
it. It is the teacher’s business to see that he does study. 
What is.more, the teacher must see that the pupil studies 
in the right way, that is, according to right rules or sound 
method. What right method is has been told in great 
part on previous pages; but the teacher is not, at this 
stage, to attempt to teach the pupil method as method. 
It will be seen that so far the pupil’s method is implied 
in his work. He is, in fact, wholly unconscious that he 
has any method at all. He does what he is The Pupil 3 a = 
Unicon: set to do, and does it as he is directed, but he 
oan’ has little sense, if any, of the reasons why he 
does it or does it in the manner directed. The 
teacher, it is assumed, conforms to the laws of the pupil’s 
mind in all that he does. .In what has now been said 
there is nothing peculiar to the art of study ; it is the same 
with all the other arts of life. John Locke may be quoted 
as follows: 
“But pray remember, children are not to be taught by rules which 
will be always slipping out of their memories. What you think nec- 
essary for them to do, settle in them by an indispensable practice as 
often as the occasion returns; and, if it be possible, make occasions, 
This will beget habits in them which, being once established, operate 
of themselves easily and naturally, without the assistance of the 
memory.” ! 
It would be even worse if the rules did not slip out of 
the child’s memory, for if retained they would only serve 
to distract him. So much at least is clear. But, more

Company, § 66.

than this, practice on the part of the pupil must continue 
to the very end of his course. Study of the art can never 
take the place of the study of any subject as a means 
of mastering the art. 
In the beginning, as we have seen, the wise teacher 
simply directs, or, what is better, leads, the pupil to do 
mhe Teacher his work ina prescribed manner. He assigns 
the Pupil’s no reasons, makes no explanations, says noth- 
eeenes: ing about rule and method. To do more 
than this would be folly. To talk to immature pupils 
about discipline, culture, mental habits, and good meth- 
ods either falls flat or makes them self-conscious and 
priggish. The only thing for the teacher to do is to see 
that they do their work well, leaving these other consid- 
erations to a later time. If the teacher does this, the 
pupil will be working into the very constitution of his 
mind the art of study as practical ability or power. 
Again, the art of study involves a general and a partic- 
ular element, corresponding to the general and the special 
methodology of teaching. The first element consists of 
rules and precepts that are of general application; the 
second constitutes the rules and precepts that relate to 
particular subjects. Then there is a practical skill in- 
volved in handling a subject that can be acquired only 
by handling that particular subject. Save in a general 
sense, the student does not learn how to handle the 
facts of history by handling the facts of science. A stu- 
dent may know how to study mathematics and not know 
how to study history; or he may succeed with grammar 
and not with literature. Every subject has its own tech- 
nique. Some remarks on the relative difficulties of mathe. 
matical and scientific method and historical and literary 
method have been made in another place.  
-P-A-G-E-235
FORMAL TEACHING OF ART OF STUDY. 235 
But the time comes when it is necessary or advanta- 
geous for the pupil to enter upon the second stage of his 
Borat art; that is, its formal or reflective stage. 
Stage. Hitherto the teacher has silently guided his 
work according to rule and method. Now he takes the 
pupil into his confidence, explaining to him in some 
measure the processes that he has been mastering by 
practice, and the rules that govern them. As a result, 
the pupil begins to consider his studies in relation to 
his own mind, and so to become somewhat self-conscious. 
To be more explicit, the teacher has hitherto seen to 
it that the pupil does not become absorbed in his environ- 
oeeites ment, that he is protected against distract- 
of Study ing influences, and that he applies himself as 
Cente tes closely as possible to his lessons. The teacher 
now causes him to understand that the things he has been 
doing are conditions of successful study, and so are es- 
sential to learning. They are now brought before him as 
rules to be observed. To take another example, the 
teacher has been in the habit of leading the pupil to def- 
initions and rules by the way of examples, or he has em- 
ployed the method of induction; but now he causes the 
pupil to understand the nature of what he has been doing, 
and the difference between induction and deduction, which 
reverses the process. He presents the rule that in at- 
tacking a new subject it is better to begin with facts than 
with definitions and rules. It is not indeed desirable for 
the teacher to use technical language, to talk about study 
as a practical art and asa reflective art; but he should 
not miss treating the things for which these names stand. 
The pupil will in some measure anticipate the teacher. 
He will of himself attend to the simpler things of method. 
He will, that is to say, see that there are rules back of the

things that he does and that these rules have practical

Anticipates not get on with his studies when he is over 
the Teacher. interested in external objects, when he is dis- 
turbed by a noisy or idle companion, or when he al- 
lows his mind to go wool-gathering. These discoveries, 
as he becomes reflective, more or less influence his mind 
and affect his work. They fortify the indispensable prac- 
tice in which the teacher strives to establish him. He 
becomes intelligent and rational in his practice, and takes 
more pleasure in it. Intellectually, he is coming to be a 
law unto himself. Nor is this all: the pupil may even 
take an interest in the rules that relate to his work, be- 
cause he sees that they embody ideas. He discovers 
order and system, or rational method, in what the teacher 
requires him to do, and is pleased and encouraged in con- 
sequence. In fact, the quick-witted pupil, well trained 
in Mis studies, will make some progress in generalizing 
his own experience without the formal assistance of his 
teacher. In other words, his art of study will pass un- 
consciously into the second stage. At the same time, it 
is the business of the teacher, as already pointed out, to 
facilitate this passage. 
It will be asked, as a matter of course, at what age or 
stage of progress in his studies the pupil should enter upon 
mnePas- the formal study of his art. The question does 
sagefrom not admit of a positive answer. Mental growth First to : | soe * .

The pupil does not become a reflective student at a def- 
inite time, as a man may enter the army, or take up the 
work of teaching at a definite time. But some approxi- 
mation to an answer can be made.

struction. These practical hints and suggestions consti- 
tute the formal art of study in its simplest elements. 
Naturally, they will become more numerous and com- 
prehensive as time goes on. By the time that the pupil 
reaches the high school, or even before, he should have 
acquired many of the elementary ideas that enter into 
the method of study, and have learned to act upon them. 
This is especially true of the more mechanical and prac- 
tical of these ideas. Study as a reflective art, the stu- 
dent cannot be expected to master until he becomes 
familiar with the main facts and principles of psychology 
and logic ; but he may be, and should be, an excellent stu-

never forget that formal teaching of the methods of 
study is not the same thing as making the pupil proficient 
in the art of study.

The teacher takes his methods from the pupil’s mind. 
It follows, therefore, that much of the knowledge of 
method, which is useful to the teacher in teaching, should 
also be useful to the learner in learning, just as soon as 
he is able to understand and apply it. A manual for the 
teacher should also be, in a certain sense, a manual 
for the pupil who is able to use it. The matter in the 
present work that might be of use to pupils has not been 
put in the form best suited to their capacity, since 
this book has been prepared primarily for the use of 
teachers. Teachers, however, should know how to select 
what they can use or adapt for the pupil’s benefit. 
The teacher and the pupil have much more in com- 
mon than has yet appeared. The teacher who is not

a double value for those for whom it is expressly written, 
—a value for them as teachers, and another, as stu- 
dents. Since many teachers have a feeble grasp of 
study as a reflective art, and are indifferent students, 
as was stated in a former chapter, they should lay to 
heart these lessons for their own sake, as well as for the 
sake of their pupils. Furthermore, some paragraphs may 
be added that teacher-students should find especially 
interesting and helpful. |

The relative lack on the part of adults of volitional 
control of their attention, or their minds, is a fact very 
Intermit- familiar to competent observers. There are 
tent Minds. intermittent minds, as there are intermittent 
fevers and intermittent springs. Many persons have never 
gained, in any proper measure, the power of self-regulation. 
They are, for the most part, controlled from without 
through their interests and feelings. Many others have 
gained this power in a degree, that is, in relation to cer- 
tain kinds of activity. Voluntary activity, through repeti- 
tion, has hardened down into routine and habit. These 
persons now run easily and swiftly, but automatically, in 
their ruts, while outside of their ruts they can hardly run 
at all. It cannot be said that they have any real self- 
mastery of their minds. There are still other persons 
who, at some time, have attained to good general discipline, 
but who, through failing to keep up their training, as an 
athlete would say, have lost it. Educated men answering 
to the last two descriptions are by no means unfrequent. 
Some of them, particularly those of the third class, are 
persons of much cultivation, Outside of their wonted 
rounds, however, they cannot set themselves to work, or, 
if they do, cannot work with efficiency. Such persons are 
almost as weak in the power of self-direction as children. 
They are good examples of arrested development: they 
have never won, or having won, have never held the 
heights of self-discipline. It may be said of persons of 
this description that they have permitted their minds to 
escape from them. 
Adults who have little volitional control over their 
minds, either because they have never acquired it, or be. 
cause they have lost it, may find it necessary to take severe 
measures with themselves. Here is a man, for example,

who, owing to his feeble power of attention, will never 
do a piece of work that he is perfectly capable of doing, 
Methods or Unless there is some cogent motive behind him. 
Ree ent What should he do? Obviously, he should 
study to put some such motive behind him. If 
he has, say, too much pride to fail if he once begins, 
then let him begin. Or, if he is too conscientious to 
break his promise, then let him promise. In these cases 
enough will is assumed to make the beginning; that 
made, pride or moral sense reénforces and steadies the 
will until the work is done. It is not uncommon for per- 
sons of a light, trifling habit and aimless life to become 
centered on some line of activity, and so become useful 
to society, simply by assuming some responsibility, — 
perhaps the care of a flower garden, the protection 
and education of a waif picked up on the street, or the 
promotion ofa charity. _ It isa commonplace that mother- 
hood often changes the whole current of a woman’s 
life, if it does not make over her character. There are 
numerous ways in which men who are doing little or 
nothing can place themselves in front of moral goads that 
will keep them up to a certain standard of efficiency ; or, 
to change the figure, numerous ways in which they can 
put themselves under bonds to do something and be some- 
body. If they can work under pressure, and not other- 
wise, then they should create the pressure. The follow- 
ing is an amusing example: 
“There is an anecdote related of himself by Alfieri, in his very inter- 
esting autobiography, describing the way in which he compelled him- 
Anecdote of Self to keep at his work. Being very fond of horses and

cursion. No matter what resolution hemade, the temptation of a 
fine day was too strong to be resisted. So he directed his servant

to tie him in his chair, and to fasten him by knots he could not 
himself loosen, and then go out of sight and hearing for a certain 
number of hours. Thus Alfieri was obliged to keep at his desk. He 
adds that to avoid the ridicule of his being found by chance visitors 
thus fastened, the servant covered him with a cloak before departing, 
Thus the higher nature conquered the lower.” 1

probable story that teaches a similar lesson. It is the

and place of residence, was well dressed, and seemed to 
have plenty of money, had not been drinking, and did 
not appear to be insane, the warden was astonished and 
demanded an explanation of his strange conduct. “I 
have had a good time all my life,” said he, “and have 
never tried to do anything for myself except enjoy my- 
self. Now I have come to such a pass that I cannot

sleep with the common herd. I believe that in this way 
Ican get the discipline of which I am so sorely in need.” 
The warden refused his request, as a matter of course, say- 
ing as he did so, that the State had made no provision for 
men like him. Whereupon the man turned away with

the declaration that he would come to the prison before 
long under conditions that would make it impossible for 
the officer to deny him the discipline that he needed. 
The story may not bi a genuine one, or the stranger may 
have been eked] upon the officer; but there is no 
question that a discipline such as they might receive in a 
well-managed penitentiary would be very useful to num- 
bers of persons who are not criminals. Possibly we need 
institutions for the confinement and discipline of such 
men as have no real self-control or power of self-regulation.

once gained, they can safely lapse into routine, 
inertia, or carelessness. This is by no means so if they 
wish to keep up their training. The mistake explains, in 
many cases, the deterioration in discipline and culture that 
marks the passage of the student from college or university 
to real life. The pressure of the school removed, he falls 
into laxity and feebleness. One or two habits of mind 
may properly be mentioned that, when carried too far, 
subvert the basis of mental discipline, destroy attention, 
and leave the mind the sport of environment.

and sustain a disciplined mind. Much the same may be 
said of the magazine or other literary journal. Such litera. 
ture has itsvalue; some acquaintance with it seems indis- 
pensable to the most cultivated persons; but something 
more and something very different is necessary if mental 
discipline is to be maintained. In the very abundance 
of such material, and the ease with which it can be used, 
lurks one of the intellectual dangers of the time. Much 
the same may be said of the reading of miscellaneous 
books without any settled plan or purpose. It leads to 
vagrant mental habits, to intellectual Bohemianism. 
There is probably no kind of literature that is more harm- 
ful to the intellect, if read indiscriminately, than sensa- 
tional novels. They excite the emotions, keep the mind 
feverish and disturbed, and destroy the intellectual fiber. 
The main point is that the easy-going, desultory 
pursuit of miscellaneous interests will neither develop 
power of attention, or mental discipline, in the first 
place, nor maintain it when it has once been developed. 
Many interests must, for the time at least, be dismissed ; 
the mind must be focused on chosen subjects, and this 
regimen must be maintained. 
The teacher, then, should look after his own will, as 
well as the wills of his pupils. His mind needs to be 
Be ke girded, his attention regulated, as well as 
to Controt theirs. This is essential to the highest success 
ore in teaching, especially when the lessons ap- 
peal to thought rather than to perception. 
A scatter-brained teacher will not focus the minds of 
pupils. Hence the value to the teacher of the admoni- 
tions: “ Do not let your mind escape from you; keep it in 
hand ; and, if it has already escaped, pursue it, capture it, 
and bring it back again.”

quated matter, still, a large part of the little treatise may 
yet be read by students with advantage. Often the pre- 
cepts and homilies of the author are set off by appropriate 
examples, incidents, and anecdotes. In the chapter on 
study, Dr. Todd presents these phases of the subject : ‘‘ The 
number of hours of daily study”; “ Have regard to the 
positions of the body while engaged in study”; “ Let 
there be no conversation in the hours of study ” ; “ Be thor- 
ough in every study’; “Expect to become familiar with 
hard study”; “ Remember that the great secret of being 
successful and accurate as a student, next to perseverance, 
is the constant habit of reviewing”; “ Be faithful in ful- 
filling your appointed exercises” ; “ Learn to rest the mind 
by variety in your studies, rather than by entire cessation 
from study.” No doubt these lessons are extremely com- 
monplace to practiced scholars ; but they are new to every 
new generation of pupils and must be learned afresh by 
them. This is one of the cases where the individual does re- 
capitulate, and must recapitulate, the experience of the race.

pages illustrating bial ctical method, and furnishing 
matter valuable in itself. 
It will be seen that we have entered the domain of self- 
culture, of which there is a large and constantly growing 
eae literature. Reference may be made to the books 
of Self- and articles coming from the press which deal 
Culture. With such topics as “ The Use of Books,” “The 
Selection of Books,” “The Hundred Best Books,” 
“Reading and Self-cultivation,” and to the multitude 
of dictionaries, cyclopedias, “literatures,” indexes, and 
bibliographies that so greatly lighten the labor and multi- 
ply the resources of the scholar. It is much to be desired 
that teachers, and older pupils too, should become ac- 
quainted with some of the books that deal with self- 
culture in its broadest phases. There is Professor John 
Stuart Blackie’s Sej{Culture: Intellectual, Physical and 
Moral, and Rev. James Freeman Clarke’s Se/f-Culture : 
Physical, Intellectual, Moral and Spiritual. The last 
comprises a series of twenty-one lectures, covering the 
whole field of self-cultivation. The author deals with the 
imagination, the conscience, the temper, the will, hope, 
reverence, and several other topics of the most practical 
character. Favorable mention may also be made of How 
to Do It, by Edward Everett Hale, Self-Cultivation in 
English, by G. H. Palmer, The Choice of Books and Other 
Literary Pieces, by Frederic Harrison, and Books That 
Have Helped Me, by various writers.

small volumes entitled Libraries and Readers, by William .

E. Foster, and Libraries and Schools, by Samuel S. 
Green. Both books contain much excellent matter re- 
lating to method. 
I may mention, too, Mr. Harry Lyman Koopmans little 
volume, De Mastery of Books. This book consists of sev- 
meee imaiia eral helpful essays or chapters, including a 
“mastery classified list of books, that is the more useful 
of Books.” because it isnot overgrown. Chapter XI. con- 
sists mainly of a judicious list of books that deal with 
the subject of reading. 
Much of the best literature relating to self-cultivation 
is found in essays and periodical articles. These may be 
readily found, if the books and periodicals are 
at hand, by the use of Poole’s Index and other 
similar works. Good articles on phases of the subject fre- 
quently appear in the numerous magazines and other 
similar publications, and the good teacher should be on 
the lookout for them. 
The mention of dictionaries, cyclopedias, and indexes 
suggests the obvious remark that, when pupils become 
old enough to use such helps, teachers should

the Diction- the art of study which is much neglected. An 
ae occasional lessonin the practical use of an un- 
abridged dictionary could be given with advantage to 
pupils who are learning to use that important work. 
However, the wise instructor who essays to teach the 
use of this work will not be content to have his students 
simply learn definitions. He will show them progress- 
ively how the dictionary itself was made, and for what 
it stands. He will point out the relation existing be- 
tween the dictionary and language and literature. He 
will not permit his pupils to think that language or liter- Periodicals.

    ature was innptie from the dictionary, but he will show 
them that the dictionary is merely an embodiment of the 
language. In other words, he will bring the pupils to see 
that good usage is the law of language, and that diction- 
aries and grammars only reflect this law. He will show 
them that such books, if sound and useful, merely em- 
body the inductive studies of language and literature 
that scholars have made. In particular, he will be sure to 
lead his pupils to examine the examples collected by the 
author illustrative of definitions. These examples, rather 
than the greater number of words and definitions, consti- 
tute the best feature of an unabridged dictionary in com- 
parison with the smaller dictionaries. They give a dis- 
tinct flavor of induction to the study of definitions, and 
so tend to prevent that dependence upon formalism and 
authority which still kills so many schools. The small 
school dictionaries are probably useful, but their use is 
attended with serious dangers. 
It has long been common for authors to insert in text- 
books “ Directions to Teachers,” “ Hints to Teachers,” and 
Hintsto  thelike. It did not seem to occur to them until 
Merchers. lately that the scholars themselves stand in need 
of such assistance even more than the teachers. But the 
authors of such works are gradually learning the lesson, 
It is now not uncommon for them to insert matter relat- 
ing to the art of study, as well as matter relating to the 
art of teaching. 
Carlyle once suggested a “ professorship of things in 
general.” He had in mind, I’ suppose, the thousand

guished librarian, the other a well-known man of letters — 
once urged a more practical proposition, namely, the 
establishment of chairs of books and reading. The pro- 
fessors who hold these chairs, these gentlemen said, should 
teach a method and not a subject.’ Perhaps it would be 
better to say that they should teach the method of using 
books and reading as a subject; for they could not, if 
they did their duty, confine themselves to the practical 
side of the work, that is, mere reading, helpful as that 
would be. 
If Tunderstand them aright, Mr. Perkins and Mr. Math- 
ews mean by the professorship of books and reading, 
oniees oF something in the nature of a professorship of 
the Pro- studies. Now, why not have in colleges and

occupant shall teach the Art of Study? Why leave this 
incomparable art, which really embraces all the other arts 
and studies of the school, mainly to be picked up by 
pupils, as it is at present? Some may say that the propo- 
sition is impracticable and some that it is unnecessary. 
Those who give the second answer may concede the 
1 Mr. Perkins and Mr. Mathews answer the question, “ What shall the 
new chair teach ?” as follows: “ Not the history of literature, nor any one 
literature, nor any one department of literature, nor the grammar of any 
language, nor any one language, nor language itself, nor any form of its 
use, nor even any particular form of thought. It is something higher than 
any of these; it is not any one subject, any one field of investigation, but 
it is a method for investigating any subject in the printed records of human 
thought. It might be compared with the calculus in applied mathematics ; 
it is a means of following up swiftly and thoroughly the best researches in 
any direction and of then pushing them further; it seeks to give a last and 
highest training for enlarging any desired department of recorded human 
knowledge. It is the science and art of reading for a purpose ; it is a cal- 
culus of applied literature.” —Public Libraries in the United States of Amer»

  250 THE ART OF STUDY. 
value of such instruction, but hold that teachers of all 
grades should themselves give this instruction in their 
schools. And this is the exact truth. Teachers should 
teach their pupils and students how to study, but to a 
great extent they fail to do so. 
Now, why do they neglect this art? Partly, no doubt, 
because they do not appreciate its importance, and partly 
Failure of because they do not know how to perform 
erie the duty. Moreover, their lack of apprecia- 
the Art. tion and lack of ability are closely bound up 
together. Hence, the beginning of practical reform 
must be the better preparation of teachers in the art of 
study — not their better preparation in general, orin the 
studies that they teach. And this at once brings into 
view the professor who is to teach teachers this sub- 
ject. 
The question will surely be asked, Is it not the duty of 
the professor of pedagogy to do this work? Undoubt- 
Duty ofthe edly it is his duty, or a part of his duty, and a

Pedagogy. el], Unfortunately, he does not always 
see clearly that there are two points of view from which 
pedagogical instruction may be regarded, viz., the learner’s 
point of view and the teacher’s point of view. It is true 
enough that the fields which are before those who hold 
these two points of view are very much the same. 
The teacher is to teach what the pupil is to learn, and 
vice versa. Still, they are not practically the same thing, 
for learning and teaching, closely connected as they are, 
are not the same activity. Again, the art of study and 
the'art of teaching, while closely connected, are still two 
different arts. 
Pedagogical instruction, as everybody knows, is com-

monly given from the teacher’s point of view. This is 
Books ana the outlook of writers and lecturers on the sub- 
Teachers. ject. To a certain extent this is perfectly right 
and proper, since instruction that is to help teachers or 
other intelligent workers must bring their own distinct 
and separate art clearly before them. But the difficulty 
is this — the teacher’s outlook is too exclusive. The reader 
of the book or the hearer of the lectures on teaching is not 
made to see, from the pupil’s point of observation, the 
ground that he and the pupil are to occupy in common, 
and the result is that he does not see as he should the 
pupil’s peculiar difficulties and needs. 
We must return to the relations of learning and teach- 
ing. Learning, we have seen, is the primary activity, and, 
as such, controls the teaching processes. The Relations > : : : of Learning teacher’s whole business as an instructor is to 
and Teach- promote learning, and he must go first to the 
cua pupil’s mind for his theory and art of teaching. 
It may seem strange, therefore, that the teacher’s point of 
view is so thoroughly dominant in the literature of the pro- 
fession. There are in the pupil’s peculiar line of activity 
no words corresponding to the words “ pedagogy” and 
“pedagogical” in the teacher’s line. The pupil has no 
science of learning, no art of study. It will probably be 
said that the pupil has no need of such a science or art; 
that his business is to learn and not to occupy himself 
with theories and methods of learning, and this, in the 
main, is perfectly true. It will be said, too, that the whole 
field of learning is included in psychology, and this state- 
ment contains much truth. Again, it will be said that 
the science of psychology is too difficult for the pupil, 
and that, even if he could learn it, the knowledge which 
he would acquire would render him little if any assistance 
 
-P-A-G-E-252
252 THE ART OF STUDY. 
in his work asa learner. This is equally true with the 
other propositions. 
But these concessions do not cover the whole ground. 
The theory and the art of teaching are based directly 
nate upon psychology. The teacher’s most familiar 
Point of rules and methods, if good, run back to the 
esr: facts of the human mind. Indeed, teaching 
is sometimes expressly called applied psychol- 
ogy. But the rules and methods of learning are applied 
psychology in a still closer sense. Learning, let it be 
said again, is the primary fact to be considered. Then 
why do not writers on education, following this line of 
treatment, give usa literature of learning, including study, 
as they have already given us a literature of teaching? 
If it is said that psychology is a literature of learning, 
and that teaching implies learning, my reply is that im- 
plication is not enough. We need to have these arts 
recognized in their own right, and this will not be done 
until teachers and writers on education come to look upon 
the operation of acquiring knowledge, or the development 
of the mind (whichever you see fit to call it), more from 
the pupil’s and less from the teacher’s point of view. 
How far the art of study could be formally taught to the 
pupil with advantage is a question that has already been 
considered; but I must insist that, if teachers generally 
could be brought around to the present point of view, it 
would be a decided advantage to their schools. They 
would see that their principal function as instructors is 
not so much to furnish their pupils with positive knowl- 
edge, as it is to show them where knowledge is, how it is 
to be gained, and to inspire them with a love of it. It 
is with the hope of accomplishing something useful in 
this direction that these pages have been written.

  CHAPTER XXII. 
TEACHING AS A MODE OF LEARNING. 
Ir is not proposed in this chapter to enlarge upon the 
general opportunities for mental cultivation that the 
teacher enjoys, which are an outgrowth of his vocation, 
but only to emphasize the natural reflex effect of this 
vocation upon his own knowledge or mental discipline, or 
to hold up to view teaching as a mode of learning. 
It is, first of all, an old saying that one cannot teach 
what one does not know. ‘There is, indeed, high authorits 
One Cannot On the other side. Pestalozzi, for example,

teacher, at least in elementary instruction. 
Method, he held, owes its results to the nature of its own 
processes, and not to the skill of him who employs it. 
He did not hesitate to affirm that a schoolbook has no 
value except in so far as it can be employed by a teacher 
without instruction, as well as by one who is well in- 
structed. A greater than Pestalozzi,Comenius himself, 
while not going quite so far as his enthusiastic disciple, 
still committed the same mistake, even giving one of his 
treatises the alternative title, ‘A Didactic Machine, 
Mechanically Contrived with a View to No Longer Stick.

ing Fast in the Work of Teaching and Learning, but 
Mistakes of Of Advancing in Them.” ‘He regards his 
Pestalozzi, method,” says Professor Laurie, “as so absolute Comenius |. : : 
and Dr. in its character that it may be likened to a ma- 
Bell. chine—a clock, ora ship, ora mill. Set it going, 
and keep it going, and you will find the result certain.” ? 
Many attempts have been made by distinguished men to 
mechanize instruction, especially elementary instruction, 
but they have failed, one and all, as they were doomed 
to fail from the nature of the case. Dr. Andrew Bell 
said that if you would give him twenty-four pupils to-day, 
he would give you back twenty-four teachers to-morrow, 
but his confidence did not prevent monitorial instruction 
from becoming a dismal failure. 
Learning is the free action of the spirit upon objects of 
knowledge, and so cannot be mechanized, while teach- 
Instruction ing is, perhaps, the most strictly spiritual act 
Cannot be of a social character that a man is capable of Mechan- : peer aeeds performing. The attempt to mechanize in- 
struction is part of the monstrous error that 
free minds can be coerced ; it has really the same root as 
religious persecution. The mind must be taught as the 
Author of Mind must be worshiped, in spirit and in 
truth. Method, indeed, holds an important place in edu- 
cation, as has been remarked more than once in these 
pages, but its place always and everywhere is in strict sub- 
ordination to the teacher. “ Give me a log hut with only 
a simple bench, Mark Hopkins on one end and I on the 
other,” said Garfield, ‘and you may have all the build- 
ings, apparatus, and libraries without him.” And yet

  256 THE ART OF STUDY. 
Garfield understood perfectly the use of books, appa- 
ratus, and buildings. The learner may learn more than 
the teacher knows, but not from the teacher. So 
far, in fact, is the teacher from being able to teach 
what he does not know, that he cannot even teach all 
that he does know. His knowledge is greater than his 
power of expression in iknghagh Something is always 
lost in the act of communication, just as an engine uses 
up much of its own power in friction. In cases where 
confiding souls suppose they know each other perfectly, 
no small part of their knowledge comes about in ways 
that they cannot explain—— they simply “ understand each 
other.” | 
In the next place, the fact has long been recognized 
that teaching is a most effective means of learning. Sir 
testimony William Hamilton once collected many strik- 
to Value of ing testimonies of distinguished men bearing Learning by 4 ; ] fi 
Teaching. on this point. The following are some of 
the anonymous ones: | 
| 
“ Knowledge stored away decays; shared with others it increases.” 
“Tf you seek to learn, teach; thus, you shall be taught yourself, for 
‘by such pursuit you will profit both yourself and your companion.” 
“To seek out many things, to retain the things sought out, to teach 
the things retained, — these three things cause the master to surpass 
the pupil.” | 
“Learn and teach others, thus you shall be safely taught yourself; 
and you shall be more certain of your art than are the ordinary.” 
“He who teaches learns; he who learns thoroughly his studies 
teaches, That you may go forth learned, I counsel you learn, teach,” 
“We learn while we teach.” 
He gives additional testimonies, assigning them to their 
authors,

Plato :*To teach is the way in which we learn most and best.” 
Seneca : “Men learn while they teach.” 
Clement of Alexandria: “ The teacher adds to his learning and is 
frequently a fellow-disciple with those whom he instructs.”

one of the Jewish Rabbis: “I have learned much from my master, 
more from my equals, but most of all from my disciples.” 
It is well known to all students of educational history 
that the mediaeval universities made extensive use of

Universi: might increase it. The first teaching at these 
nee universities does not appear to have been so 
much professional teaching as a system of mutual instruc- 
tion. A student who had found repute among his fellows 
gathered a little body of pupils round him, and thus 
supported himself for a few years until something better 
offered University degrees were first instituted for a 
practical purpose, being the first mode of certificating 
teachers used in the modern world. The doctor's and 
master’s degrees were one and the same thing, as the 
doctor, the master, and the professor were one and the 
same person looked at from different points of view. As 
a doctor this person was learned or instructed, as a 
master he taught, as a professor he “ professed” or held 
himself open to teach. 
I shall venture to summarize an instructive passage 
from Sir William Hamilton, which bears upon our sub- 
ject. 
The older universities regarded the exercise of teaching as a neces- 
sary condition of a perfect knowledge; in recent times, the universities

have with equal unanimity neglected this exercise. Yet there can be

to be taught; but, on the other hand, the preparation for, and the 
very process of, instruction reacts most beneficially on the knowl- 
edge of the instructor, if the instructor be intellectually and morally 
what he ought to be. Ifso, teaching constrains him toa clear and 
distinct consciousness of his subject in all its bearings; it brings 
to his observation any want or obscurity lurking in his comprehension 
of it as a whole; and urges him to master any difficulty the solution of 
which he may have previously adjourned. The necessity of answering 
the interrogations of others compels him, in fact, to interrogate and to 
answer himself. In short, what he has learned synthetically, he 
must now study analytically ; but a combination of analysis and syn- 
thesis is the condition of a perfect knowledge. Still, it must not be 
supposed that the older universities, while enjoining the practice of 
instruction as a means of learning, abandoned the higher academical 
teaching to student-doctors. On this point, their practice was to re- 
quire the student to learn from the learned, while he himself taught 
the unlearned. With many academical instructors, teaching is at best 
a mechanical effort, a mere pouring out of what has been previously 
poured in; professing to teach, teaching is for them no self-improving 
process, and as to their pupils, they “teach the young parrots to 
whistle the same as they were taught to whistle when they learned to 
become parrots,” 1 
It is easy to see that student-teachers could not in the 
long run compete with professional teachers, but would 
have to yield to them in the end. Iam inno

profit by it. The student that I have in mind is not an im- 
mature pupil in school practicing upon his fellow-pupils, 
but a properly equipped teacher, regularly engaged in the 
work of instruction. Such teacher, as we have seen, 
must have a sufficient stock of knowledge with which to 
begin, but the beginning once made he has an admirable 
opportunity both to improve the quality and increase the 
quantity of his knowledge and a strong incitement to 
make the most of it. These more practical remarks will 
close the subject: 
1. The teacher will commonly discover, at least if his 
work is not very elementary, that much of what he 
Imperfect knows needs to be improved in its quality ; it 
eeu ef is marked by a certain generality and indefinite- 
Teachers ness. He now finds out that the step from 
Knowledge. the pupil’s chair to the teacher's platform is a 
long one. He does not feel so sure of his knowledge in 
the new place as he did in the old one. The questions of 
the pupils, like the arrows of the archer, find the weak 
spots in his harness, and he sees the need of knowing 
many things better than he actually does know them. 
2. He also discovers that his knowledge is insufficient 
in quantity, as well as inferior in quality. Under the 
Pe changed conditions, the questions of the pupils 
ficientin reveal his limitations much more thoroughly 
Quantity. than the questions of his own instructors have 
ever done. Subjects are brought before him in new ways ; 
new vistas open to his vision that he never saw be- 
fore; and he feels the constant pressure of a great re- 
sponsibility. Unconsciously, perhaps, he has become a 
pupil along with his pupils. 
3. The teacher now learns, what he could not have 
fully understood before, that studies may be regarded from

Studyofa and that the two prospects, which lie open to 
Subiccicn thesight, while they have much in common, still

now is not how to learna subject for himself, but how to 
teach it to another, or how to help another to learn 
it. He is led to study the delicate art of asking questions 
in its concrete relation to the subject-matter and to the 
mind of the pupil, and thus begins to understand Bacon’s 
famous saying that the skillful question is the half 
of knowledge. As Sir William Hamilton says, the in- 
terrogations of others compel the teacher to interro- 
gate himself. In a word, the pedagogical element of a 
subject is so essential to complete knowledge that one can 
hardly be said to understand fully what one has not 
taught.

Halleck’s Psychology and 
Psychic Culture 
By REUBEN POST HALLECK, M.A. (Yale) 
Cloth, 12mo, 368 pages. Illustrated . é . _ Price $1.25 
This new text-book in Psychology and Psychic Culture 
is suitable for use in High School, Academy and College 
classes, being simple and elementary enough for beginners 
and at the same time complete and comprehensive enough 
for advanced classes in the study. It is also well suited 
for private students and general readers, the subjects being 
treated in such an attractive manner and relieved by so 
many apt illustrations and examples as to fix the attention 
and deeply impress the mind. 
The work includes a full statement and clear exposition 
of the coérdinate branches of the study—physiological and 
introspective psychology. The physical basis of Psychol- 
ogy is fully recognized. Special attention is given to 
the cultivation of the mental faculties, making the work 
practically useful for self-improvement. The treatment 
throughout is singularly clear and plain and in harmony 
with its aims and purpose. 
“ Halleck’s Psychology pleases me very much. It is short, clear, 
interesting, and full of common sense and originality of illustration, 
1 can sincerely recommend it.”

Professor of Psychology, Harvard University.

A new and revised edition of this popular text-book for beginners in 
the study, and for the general reader. The book has been entirely 
rewritten, and improved by the addition of many new illustrations and 
interesting descriptions of the latest phases and discoveries of the science. 
In contents and dress it is an attractive volume, well suited for its use.

This is the standard text-book in geology for high school and elementary 
college work. While the general and distinctive features of the former 
work have been preserved, the book has been thoroughly revised, enlarged, 
and improved. As now published, it combines the results of the life 
experience and observation of its distinguished author with the latest 
discoveries and researches in the science. 
DANA'S MANUAL OF GEOLOGY . tLe ile bh .  G9.00) 
Fourth Revised Edition, This great work is a complete thesaurus of 
the principles, methods, and details of the science of geology in its 
varied branches, including the formation and metamorphism of rocks, 
physiography, orogeny, and epeirogeny, biologic evolution, and paleon- 
tology. It is not only a text-book for the college student but a hand- 
book for the professional geologist. The book was first issued in 1862, 
a second edition was published in 1874, and a third in 1880. Later 
investigations and developments in the science, especially in the geology 
of North America, led to the last revision of the work, which was most 
thorough andcomplete. This last revision, making the work substantially 
a new book, was performed almost exclusively by Dr. Dana himself, and 
may justly be regarded as the crowning work of his life.

  The English Sentence 
By LILLIAN G. KIMBALL l| 
Instructor in English, State Normal School, Oshkosh, Wisconsin 
| 
Cloth, 12mo, 244 pages. Price, 75 cents 
‘The Structure of the English Sentence” is a text- 
book intended for the use of teachers of English, and for 
students in high schools, academies, and normal schools. 
It does not deal with etymology, but is devoted entirely 
to syntax,—the function of words, phrases, and clauses 
in the sentence,—the part that the different sentence- 
elements play in the communication of thought. 
The method of analyzing sentences employed in the 
book is simple and practical, and will appeal to both 
teacher and pupil. Phrases—prepositional, infinitive, and 
participial—are treated as abridgments of propositions, 
not as substitutes for them; and their superiority in 
force, economy, and simplicity to the dependent prop- 
osition is brought out as the determining factor in their 
employment. The infinitive is treated from the point of 
view of its relation to some other word in the sentence, 
some noun, verb, or adjective without which the infinitive 
would not be in the sentence at all. In this way an 
element usually considered difficult is made clear and 
comprehensible. 
It is believed that this work, in the material which it 
furnishes and in its method of presentation, will fulfill its 
author’s aim and purpose to make a text-book which 
should promote and encourage the study of English by 
leading students to understand and appreciate the perfect 
adaptability of the English sentence to the noble burden 
that it bears,—that of communicating thought.

  INTRODUCTION 
HE pleasure.of telling stories and of listening to 
them is as deep rooted in human nature as the 
ractice is old in the history of man. It may be 
that the printed book has displaced a custom of the 
most primitive antiquity, to which we owe those 
stories which form a background for every national 
literature and enter into the fibre of every national 
mind. But though the book ministers to a newer 
human need, that of solitude, none the less may it 
help to foster that older demand which finds par- 
ticular expression in the little child’s “Tell me a 
story.” Reading aloud makes less demand upon the 
memory, and a wealth of stories beyond the dreams 
of the children of pre-printing days is now ready to 
hand. Sq numerous are they that the problem of 
choice presents itself very quickly to the thoughtful 
vaciben oF tauaker who is not merely concerned to 
satisfy an instinctive craving, but is anxious that the 
child should get, togethor with the enjoym ent, the 
greatast ORIBIG-Taeasure oF apiniowal nourishment. 
With the help of the first section of the Bibliography 
at the end of this book, access may be found to a 
large number of stories suitable for reading aloud

  x INTRODUCTION 
—or for the older child’s own reading alone. It 
is indeed debatable whether the story and the child 
do not often make the ideal association without 
the intervention of the middleman—the story 
teller; but all stories are not ready to be so 
assimilated, and most of these chapters have been 
written in the hope that they will help parents and 
teachers to tell some of the stories in their own words. 
Little children often demand something more than a 
tale, however absorbing, in literary form. They look 
~ before all else for something which comes from the 
teller, an intimacy of relation between him and them- 
salves STOGIHIGEGH TE the tolling, a personablonaes 
which reading from the page inevitably lacks. 
To satisfy this demand is the art of the story teller, 
an art, like all others, with a technique of its own; 
with this technique Chapters IV. and V. are con- 
cerned. 
In retelling and reading the stories common to us, 
from the Slayers of Dragons to the tales of King 
Arthur and Roland, or the mythologies of the Norse- 
“men and Greeks, how many of us realise that we are 
introducing childhood to childhood; the childhood 
of our own day to the childhood of the race ? There 
is something appropriate in this. The simple direct- 
ness and naiveté of the ancient childhood is shared by 
and appeals to our own, and it is just this fact which 
has made of so much traditional lore so many of 
the stories worth retelling, to-day. The book opens
-P-A-G-E-11
  INTRODUCTION xi 
with an account of the nature of some of these 
origins. 
But there is an adverse consideration as well. 
May it not be that in filling our children’s minds with 
these products of bygone ages we help in part to 
perpetuate thought and feeling which it has been the 
healthy trend of eyolution to outrun_and abandon ? 
However we may answer this question, which is dis- 
cussed at some length in Chapter III., we cannot but 
be helped to a decision by a fuller understanding of 
the origin and setting of our tales, an understanding 
which should also add to the quality and significance, 
both for ourselves and for our hearers, of those we 
elect to retain. 
The plea of this book is throughout for a wider 
knowledge on the story teller’s part of the stories he 
tells; but it must be quite clear that he should not 
offer to his hungry children the ‘stone’ of explana- 
tion and information for the ‘bread’ of the story 
itself; the harvest of his wider reading and medita- 
tion should be so assimilated and should so enrich 
him that in the act of telling the story both giver and 
receiver are blessed. I cannot refrain from quoting 
from On the Art of Reading: “ Don’t stop to explain 
that Hebe was (for once) the legitimate daughter of 
Zeus and, as such, had the privilege to draw wine for 
the Gods. Don’t even stop, just yet, to explain who 
the Gods were. Don’t discourse on amber, other- 
wise ambergris; don’t explain that ‘gris’ in this
-P-A-G-E-12

connection doesn’t mean ‘grease’; don’t trace it 
through the Arabic into Noah’s Ark. . . . Don’t in- 
sist philologically that when every shepherd ‘ tells 
his tale’ he is not relating an anecdote, but simply 
keeping tally of his flock. Just go on reading, as 
well as you can; and be sure that when the children 
get the thrill of it, for which you wait, they will be 
asking more questions, and pertinent ones, than you 
are able to answer.”* It is just at this point that 
we shall need the help our wider reading has given us. 
Many books and stories are quoted. Where a 
reference is not given in the text, the work will be 
found in the Bibliography. No story is given ready 
for telling, for this would defeat the aim of the book, 
which is to bring out the importance of the teller’s 
own study and preparation. Though we know that 
there are born story tellers, we also know that the 
majority of us have not been endowed so richly as 
to make such a study unnecessary. 
My grateful thanks are due to Mr. Ernest Rhys and 
Messrs. J. M. Dent & Co., for kindly giving me per- 
mission to use “ The Black Bull of Norroway,” an 
extract from “The Defeat of Time,” and a passage 
from “Tom Tit Tot,” all in Fairy Gold in the Every- 
man Series; to Mr. Joseph Conrad and Messrs. 
William Blackwood & Sons for the lengthy extract 
from Youth in Chapter V.; to Mr. Frank Sidgwick

and Messrs. Sidgwick & Jackson, as author and pub- 
lishers of the poem I have adapted to the story of 
“Pan and the Babe’; to Messrs. Macmillan & Co., 
for permission to quote from Stopford Brooke’s 
rendering of “The Andreas” in my adaptation of 
the poem to “ The Legend of St. Andrew”; and to 
my own publishers for their most helpful suggestions 
as to the final form this book should take. 
One other word of acknowledgment—or excuse— 
is due. I have tried unavailingly to trace “ W. B.” 
and “J. B. B.,” the authors of the article on “ Fair- 
ies,” from the Journal of Experimental Pedagogy, 
quoted in Chapter III. Professor J. A. Green gave 
me his consent, as editor, to use it, but before he 
‘could put me in touch with the authors themselves, 
his own work was laid down, and the one likely 
channel of communication was closed. I can only 
hope that, should my pages fall into their hands, 
they will be satisfied with the new surroundings in 
which “ K.” appears.

  INTRODUCTION 
TO THE AMERICAN EDITION 
. book is so full of suggestions that it could 
form the basis for years of study. To begin 
at the end, the chapters on the technique of story 
telling and on picture making and word choosing are 
just as valuable to the story writer as to the story 
teller. I know of no book on story telling that gives 
such a nice emphasis to the choice of words, and 
we need that here in America from the primary 
grades through college. Perhaps it is because we 
have had to teach so many foreign-born children the 
rudiments of English that we have not emphasized, 
as do all other educated countries, the use of right 
words, the choice of words for their sound as well 
as for their finer shades of meaning that make effec- 
tive speech. Children are apt to be much more 
sensitive than we to the poetry of sound and the 
story teller’s recognition of this adds another charm 
to his art.’ 
Another suggestive characteristic of this work is 
its taking for granted that teachers, librarians, in 
fact all story tellers, will have a large library to draw 
on and will keep on reading new books, prose and 
poetry, always with an eye and ear attuned to what

will enrich the story tellers’ own experience as well 
as what will minister to the children. 
Finger the book through and note just a few of 
the names that show the author’s range and appli- 
cation: Edward Carpenter—philosophy and compar- 
ative religion ; Francis Thompson, Whitman, Tagore, 
George Macdonald—mysticism, faith in the things 
of the spirit; F. B. Jevons and Jane Harrison— 
Greek thought and its influence; Yeats, de la Mare, 
Edward Thomas, Hilda Conkling, W. H. Davies— 
poetry of to-day; Bennett, Walpole, Clemence Dane, 
Compton Mackenzie—stories of people to-day ; James 
Stephens and The Crock of Gold—yes, she does 
quote: “ I have learned,” said the Philosopher, “ that 
the head does not hear anything until the heart has 
listened, and that what the heart knows to-day the 
head will understand to-morrow.” Good! Both in- 
tellect and emotion have been used in writing this 
study. 
And reading as it was written gives one such 
respect for folk tales that this paragraph in the 
author’s introduction raises a query: “In retelling 
and reading the stories common to us, from the 
Slayers of Dragons to the tales of King Arthur and 
Roland, or the mythologies of the Norsemen and 
Greeks, how many of us realize that we are intro- 
ducing childhood to childhood; the childhood of our 
own day to the childhood of the race? The simple 
directness and naiveté of the ancient childhood is 
shared by and appeals to our own, and it is just this 
fact which has made of so much traditional lore 
so many of the stories worth retelling to-day.” Why 
do we tell and retell those wise old tales? Because
-P-A-G-E-17
  INTRODUCTION xvii 
in the childhood of the race men had such simple 
minds that they easily produced those naive tales 
fit for our children? Or because in the childhood 
of the race men had such understanding of the fun- 
damentals of human character and such imagination 
that they could clothe their understanding with a 
grace we cannot better to-day? It was the seers who 
told the tales in the old days and when we repeat 
them is it not first because we still love them our- 
selves, recognizing more and more their depth and 
beauty? Have we gone much beyond that childhood 
of the race? I wonder. 
I like this book, for the sense of sound scholarship 
in it, for the author’s devotion to her subject and 
for her evident expectation of a corresponding. de- 
votion from her readers. 
I like the way she has really studied origins, has 
mastered as far as may be the stories of many dif- 
ferent races and then has just sat down and thought 
them all over, so that out of her knowledge she has 
created understanding. Without that the knowing 
would not mean much; with that we have a survey 
of story telling from the earliest times, a search for 
and finding of the same truths in many forms and 
from many peoples, emphasizing those that have 
built up the Anglo-Saxon tradition; and, as the 
author carries her understanding into wide fields of 
reading to-day, there is a satisfying proof of the 
continuity of literature, which means a satisfying 
proof of the enduring human qualities that make 
faith and hope and love and the ability to put them 
into words in any age. 
Of course story tellers are born, not made, and

xviii INTRODUCTION 
no book can make a story teller. But, granted that, 
any one who follows these pages sympathetically must 
be fired with a zeal for accomplishment that is bound 
to mean better, richer story telling and story writing; 
for, I repeat, this book has just as much for the 
writer as for the teller. May it go far. I wish 
I’d had it ten years ago when I was trying to tell 
stories myself.

  CHILDREN’S STORIES 
CHAPTER I 
ORIGINS: THE MAKING OF THE GODS 
Story-telling as a Racial Activity. Stories as the reflec- 
tion of the Racial Mind. This is illustrated by reference 
to the growth of the Gods. 
HAT circumstances-in—the life of man gave ~ 
rise to his desire.for-stories;and to the cul- 
tivation of what_is undoubtedly the oldest of the 
arts? Long before men discarded their weapons 
with their incised designs, they sat round their fires 
at night. The “red flower” fire—was not only a 
place of safety, but its warm glow being shared in 
common,stimulated social sympathies and induced 
men to communicate their experiences. When fire 
was invented, then story telling began, and the home 
hearth is still the place above all others for the 
enjoyment of stories. : 
At first it was probably nothing more than the 
bare ee out very largely by gesture and inarticulate cries, with 
echoing refrains from the ‘listeners who. reflected 
the ~tnnod_of the_story_retherthan_itaincidents, 
Words were in their infancy, the need for greater 
definiteness would be felt first in the story; moods 
have less variety than circumstances, and they

found suitable expression in rhythm or monotonous 
sing-song. Even when language was highly devel- 
oped, the pleasure of rhythmic repetition was so 
great that the practice of the half articulate was 
maintained in the chorus. Many an old ballad in 
print to-day, and hunting and drinking songs, have 
refrains of that kind. No doubt these recitals were 
often accompanied by the swinging of the limbs and 
body in rhythmic unity with the words, as the peas- 
ant story eller of Finland still takes the hands of 
his hearers and Teads the company in the swing- 
ing chant of the saga. 
A good story teller would soon find that his lis- 
teners were much keener about the story than its 
truthfulness, and a bare recital would rapidly de- 
velop into an artistic blend of fact and fiction; at 
first a little embroidery, then, the wish being father 
to the thought, not what really happened, but what 
the réciter wished had happened, crept into the tale. 
For the good story teller, that is true which fits 
his story best and produces the effect he desires; he 
makes a harmony of parts in a whole clearly con- 
ceived. 
As men grew more skilled in defence and in pro- 
viding food and shelter, they were freer to devote 
more time and energy to the pursuit of pleasure; 
what smo aOW-cait-the-Brn-of Tite hogan ta, be pur- 
sued for their own sake. Story, song and dance, as > nape : 
the most social 0: ese arts, were part: yu- 
lar. At first indeed they were so intimately con- 
nected as to be actually indistinguishable; the in- 
vention of writing helped.to-make.three-distinct arts 
gut of what was originally one. 
 
-P-A-G-E-21
  THE MAKING OF THE GODS 3 
When stories were first committed to writing it 
is probably impossible to say, but it is quite certain 
that stories were not written and invented at the 
gamé time; the oldést writers only set down what 
they knew by heart, as they had learnt it from story 
tellers, who themselves had their stories from an 
@arlier_generation. Many of these stories had in 
fact_their roots far, far back in prehistoric times. 
Sometimes they were handed on trom parents to 
children, sometimes a professional class of story 
teller sprang up. In this way traditions were pre- 
served, many of which were not committed to writ- 
ing until people in our own day began to hunt for 
them in country places, and put them down as they 
were told by village cobblers or old peasant women, 
whose “ Once upon..a.time.”’ carries us back to the 
indefinite past when story making and story telling 
were perhaps the greatest of human delights. 
To be aeceptallo, to find a secure place in the 
evergrowing volume of traditional story which each 
generation passed on to the next, stories must have 
possessed qualities particularly. su ited to human 
needs; for one.story...which..succeeded in establish- 
ing itsclf_oa_a permanent possession, there must 
have been hundreds which were quite momentary in 
their appeal, just_as to-day the majority of books 
pu brief life. When we come 
to the question of choice, we may possibly accept 
the principle that what has survived ages of criti- 
cism is likely to be better than what is quite new, 
though there may be other considerations which 
make our choice more difficult. 
Even a cursory examination of traditional stories  
-P-A-G-E-22
4 CHILDREN’S STORIES 
reveals certain interesting characteristics; they 
nearly all express the human emotion of wonder, 
and some attempt to satisfy primitive, childlike, en- 
tirely uncritical curiosity ... “Who are we?” 
“Where do we-come from?” “Who makes the 
thunder?” “What is the wind?” “ What are 
the stars?” “What happens to us when we die?” 
Questions of this kind are not peculiar to 
one people, or to one time. Nearly every nation 
and every literature has stories dealing with prob- 
lems of this type. The naiveté and charm of the 
solutions make them magnificent sources for the 
modern story teller; they are as free from senti- 
mentalism as our own Bible stories. 
Sometimes a God of Gods makes a world all un- 
aided, and in a few days . . . or weeks, or years. 
. . . Sometimes the marriage of Heaven and Earth 
produces the race of man... sometimes a cow 
licks a rock . . . and . . . sometimes the gods fling 
forth a woman from their abode, she settles on a 
tortoise, and ... In the Kalevala, the national 
epic of Finland, the origin of the world is de- 
scribed. Elmata, Air’s youngest daughter, wearied 
of the air, sank upon the heaving waste of waters 
below. Here she remained for seven long centuries, 
till the Water Mother heard her cry of desolation and 
sent a bird to rest on her knees as she floated. It built 
a nest of seaweed, and laid eggs, which fell to the 
bottom of the sea, breaking into many fragments . . . 
“From the cracked egg’s lower fragment, 
Now the solid earth was fashioned, 
From the cracked egg’s upper fragment, 
Rose the lofty arch of heaven. 
 
-P-A-G-E-23
  THE MAKING OF THE GODS 5 
From the yolk, the upper portion, 
Now became the sun’s bright lustre; 
From the white, the upper portion, 
Rose the moon that shines so brightly, 
Whatso in the egg was mottled, 
Now became the stars in heaven, 
‘Whatso in the egg was blackish, 
In the air as cloudlets floated.” + 
This attitude of mind is seen in Hiawatha, who, 
when a little child, stood at the tent door watching 
the silver moon slowly sailing over the water; he 
saw the flecks and shadows on it, and whispered 
“What is that, Nokomis?” and the good Nokomis 
answered “Once a warrior very angry, seized his 
grandmother and threw her up into the sky at mid- 
night, right against the sky he threw her; ’tis her 
body that you see there... ” The child saw the 
rainbow luminous above, and he was told that the 
dead flowers of earth bloom again in the sky. “’Tis 
the Heaven of flowers you see there. ” ? 
Not only do we find in the literatures of different 
times and peoples attempts to answer the same ques- 
tion, though in many different ways, but we recog- 
nise a similar effort to overcome man’s limitation of 
Time and Space; the Cap of Darkness and the Shoés 
of Swiftness are common property. 
We may trace sometimes a close parallel in plot. 
The story of Pandora and the forbidden box ° is very 
suggestive of Eve’s temptation in the Garden of 
Eden. Both live in Paradise, and as the story un-

Hawthorne, has one under the title of ‘‘ The Paradise of Children.”
-P-A-G-E-24
  6 CHILDREN’S STORIES 
folds we hear of the temptation to look, to touch, 
to disobey the one command. We see in both stories 
the darkening clouds gather consequent on the act, 
the coming of the torments, evils and fears to which 
man has ever since been heir. The sequel, too, is 
significant, both Eve and Pandora, though giving 
pain and sorrow with one hand, give hope and joy 
with the other... . 
We are reminded * that “Some of the widespread 
myths and folk tales may be as old as the French and 
Spanish cave paintings and ivory carvings. Who 
will venture, for instance, to date the origin of that 
far-travelled tale about the lovers who escape from 
the giant’s den and throw down pebbles which be- 
come mountains, and twigs which create forests, to 
delay their angry pursuer? The late Mr. Andrew 
Lang has shown that it is found in Zulu, Gaelic, 
Norse, Malagasy, Russian, Italian and Japanese folk 
literature. The author ‘ will never,’ he wrote, ‘ be 
known to fame,’ although among story tellers he has 
achieved ‘the widest circulation in the world.’ ” 
The eternal truth of the Sleeping Beauty is not 
ours alone, practically every folk lore, it is said, has 
a story showing Love’s supreme power to awaken, 
and triumph finally over sleep and apathy, and even 
death; the evil charm is only temporary, the power 
of love eternal.” 
One favourite, Cinderella, is everywhere, under 
1Orete and Pre-Hellenic Europe, by A. MacKenzie. 
2 Perrault tells the story of the Sleeping Beauty which belongs to 
a cycle of stories, having the Hnchanted Princess and Her Rescue as 
the theme; the Niblung and Volsunga Saga gives Odin as pricking 
Brynhild with the sleep thorn, which induces deep slumber on the 
Hindfell till Sigurd comes to wake her.
-P-A-G-E-25
  THE MAKING OF THE GODS q 
different names; sometimes she is Ashodell, or Cap 
o’ Rushes, or Catskin, but there she is, alternating 
between the sooty little drudge in the kitchen and 
the beautiful nameless Princess. Mr. Rhys reminds 
us that “A fairy tale, like a cat, has nine lives, it 
can pass into many queer shapes, and yet not die. 
You may cut off its head, or drown it in sentiment, 
or sea water, or tie a moral to its tail, but it will 
still survive and be found sitting safe by the fire 
some winter night.” * 
It is interesting to try to account for these com- 
mon likenesses, coming as they do from peoples far 
removed in time and space. The constant movement 
of tribes w: nd to an interchange of stories, both 
conquerors and conquered would tell them; slaves, 
gipsies, wanderers, travellers, merchants and sailors 
would carry their stories with them and exchange 
them in a leisure hour with others by the way; the 
great red fires in the nobles’ dining halls must have 
made a splendid market for stories, too. But there 
is more in it than this. These tales with a common 
plot spring from the heart of a people; wherever 
and whoever they were, they tell of their wishes, 
their aspirations, and their dreams; they are all 
alike in that vital quality which has preserved them 
to our own day, and they still ring true to our own 
inner experience. 
We will now consider the appearance of the gods 
in Racial Thought to illustrate this, for these stories 
are not merely narratives of bare fact, but do actually 
reflect the experience of the race. “ Mythology, 
like language, is the work and possession of the 
  1 Fairy Gold. Everyman Series. Dutton.

  8 CHILDREN’S STORIES 
21 common consciousness,” * and belongs therefore to 
us, as “heirs of all the ages,” and more especially 
to us who are the tellers of these stories. We should 
strive to understand in some slight way how it is 
that the gods have appeared “clothed with dominion 
and terror, or with grace and beauty,” hovering 
“like phantoms for thousands and scores of thou- 
sands of years over the earliest races of the 
earth.” * We tell of Pallas Athene, who comes to 
strengthen and encourage, of Mercury the fleet- 
footed eager messenger, of Diana the Lady of the 
Wild Things, of Pan the mocking, the dreaded yet 
sweetly alluring vision haunting stream and hill; 
and we should try to account for these shining mys- 
terious figures, if we can, asking ourselves whether 
they are the result of conscious artistry, or are of 
deeper significance. 
Careful study has led many to accept the latter 
view, and in this chapter, the gods are presented as 
reflections of racial thought, desire and emotion, 
being indeed acts of creation wrought through the 
Race itself, manifestations of the great world self, 
recognised, called out and kept in racial memory, 
though constantly changed and modified, as the life 
of the Race is changed and modified. 
We find very early in the history of man the ten- 
dency to transfer his own moods, activities and atti- 
tudes to natural phenomena; the processes of nature 
are expressed in terms of human action. The child 
and the poet’s lively fancy is akin in this . . . the 
lamps are lit in heaven when the stars shine in the 
night sky...

“What lovely things 
Thy hand hath made; 
The smooth-plumed bird 
In its emerald shade, 
The seed of the grass, 
The speck of stone.” + 
There is a further step which the recognition of 
movement brings about, perhaps; at one time water 
is still, and at another ruffled and broken, some- 
times trees are silent, but on other days they whisper, 
groan and whimper. /There must then be a spirit 
within the material manifestation which shows it- 
self thus, and which can go in and out at will, 
until at length it leaves its physical habitation alto- 
gether, becoming a ghost f among these shadowy be- 
ings some are more kindly disposed towards man 
than others, and these become gods to be entreated 
and finally worshipped. \ 
Gradually too, as the narrower individual point of 
view widens into the community sense, the god can 
be no longer possessed by the one, but is shared by 
the many. The fetish, the potent property of the 
individual, is given up as the conception of a god 
ready to help all grows clearer. Magical rites give 
place to concerted acts of worship and spells to 
prayer, the little talisman of luck in the hand is 
abandoned and the figure of the God, the Helper and 
Saviour of His people grows as the self-conscious- 
ness of the community deepens. 
“ Just as a fetish was much more than the mere 
object in the hand, having a mutual claim upon its 
owner, and extending its power far beyond its own

type of object, so the god externalised as idol, is far 
more than an idol, he stands for fundamental things, 
he potently pervades all the activities of the com- 
munity who created him.” * 
There is the mingling of the two selves in the 
figure of the great god Pan, a god in human form, 
yet with the horns and hoofs of a goat; not only out- 
wardly, but in sentiment too, a significant blend of 
the higher and lower self. Mrs. Browning gives a 
picture of him as he went down to the peaceful, sun- 
lit river, and tore out a reed from the deep cool 
beds ts. 
“ Spreading ruin and scattering ban, 
Splashing and paddling with hoofs of a goat, 
And breaking the golden lilies afloat. 
* * * * 
The limpid water turbidly ran, 
And the broken lilies a-dying lay, 
And the dragon fly had fled away, 
Ere he brought it out of the river.” 
Then as he blew sweet music through the pipe of his 
making, he rejoices... 
“Yet half a beast is the great god Pan, 
To laugh as he sits by the river, 
Making a poet out of a man; 
The true gods sigh for the cost and pain 
For the reed which grows nevermore again, 
As a reed with the reeds by the river.” ? 
And as Francis Thompson puts it: 
“Though Pan may have delicious throat, 
’Tis hard to tolerate the goat.

Man has always created God in his own image, 
so that gradually as the self-consciousness of man 
grew, his gods became human and lovable... 
Mortal man made god in his own image. 
“ Like to himself in vesture, voice and body, 
Had they but hands, methinks oxen and lions 
And horses would have made them gods like fashioned, 
Horse gods for horses, oxen gods for oxen.” *

Some feel that the sense of mystery and reverence is 
lowered by this idea—the “ spirit is scarcely reli- 
gious which makes of Eros a boy trundling a hoop, 
or Apollo a youth throwing a stone at a lizard. 
This bringing down of the god to the every-dayness 
of the worshipper, confines that worshipper within 
his own limits.” Yet to-day many find untold com- 
fort and inspiration in the thought that the Godhead 
took upon Himself the lowly limitation of a man of 
sorrows, and walked the ways of Palestine for three 
and thirty years, a Son of man, often hungry and 
footsore, and with no place to lay His head. 
Not only did man make gods in his own image, 
but placed them in relationships somewhat akin to 
his own. We hear of Mother Earth, the Lady of the 
Earth, the Consort of the Lord of the Sky, the 
mother Demeter and her daughter Persephone* . . 
There is the Olympian group, with Zeus, Father a 
Gods, and Hera the wife... There is the Holy 
Family, enshrined particularly at Christmas time, 
St. Joseph, the Madonna and the Child. It is only 
natural that a race of children should make and 
worship a Mother God. 
Another point of view sees the gods as the Guar- 
dians of Morality; as the expression and embodi- 
ment of great formative ideas. While being grad- 
ually evolved by the peoples of the earth, growing 
through coarseness and imperfection towards beauty 
and perfection, we have as well the gods already es- 
tablished in high heaven before the worlds began. 
1 Though some consider these two are the older and younger 
forms of the same person, rather than the mother and daughter, 
thus making one goddess instead of two.

  THE MAKING OF THE GODS 13 
There is a recognition here that the virtues are eter- 
nal; Justice, Truth, Beauty are from the foundations 
and before. They show themselves through the tran- 
sitory, themselves eternal. These formative ideas 
take shape as gods just as soon as man in his grow- 
ing experience calls them forth, needs them, recog- 
nises them. They crystallise then through racial 
memory into the gods we know. “ These ideas on 
their inner and essential side are states of being, 
states of feeling, it is on their outer side that they 
take form and structure.” * 
Each tribe, nation, race will recognise the god 
most akin to its own ideals; thus a warlike race will 
be sensitive to acts of physical courage and daring, 
and certain sentiments naturally gather round the 
warrior god, while the saviour god is associated with 
self-renunciation and mortification of the body and 
belongs to a different type of people. The hero king 
and saviour god is found in the group most sympa- 
thetic to him; individual acts of leadership and 
sacrifice are thrown as faggots on to the glowing 
centre, and instead of time dimming it, the wonder 
is increased, the mystery and inspiration grow, for 
racial memory plays its part in the making of the 
gods; and at last the shining figure of the particular 
god appears, wrought partly out of sentiments, emo- 
tions, ideas of many generations, and partly by the 
continual personal acts of man himself. So we 
get a composite figure waxing till another glory 
succeeds it. We see here then the double action of 
the idea working through the stuff of generations, 
and the generations throwing it out and making more 
of it. There is the constant interplay, the outer

  14 CHILDREN’S STORIES 
stimulating the inner, the inner keeping alive the 
outer; there is the constant inner building of the 
ideal, and the outer recognition of it, while racial 
memory binds all into one glowing whole. 
We can see this action in the story of “ The Knife 
and the Naked Chalk.” * The Flint Worker, more 
imaginative and courageous than his kinsfolk, braves 
the enchantments and terrors of unknown but 
dreaded places, and bargains with the Children of 
the Night who dwell there, for the knife of metal 
which will conquer the marauding wolf. He comes 
back safely, though with scars and the loss of an 
eye, and wins for his people the knife which gives 
safety. He is the son of a priestess, and because of 
this, magnified by this momentous act, his kinsmen 
look upon him as superhuman, and the loneliness of 
a god falls upon him. His woman will not live 
with him, though she asks his blessing, and his fel- 
lows shun though they worship him. He is lifted 
above human kind and exalted into a god, becoming 
identified with the great god Tyr,’ who gave his 
right hand to conquer a beast. No man would walk 
on his shadow, and in utter loneliness of spirit he 
comes back to his mother, whose reassuring whisper, 
“Whether you live or die or are made different, I 
am your mother,” draws him; and he asks her, 
“What is to be done to the people who say that I 
am Tyr?” She said ... “He who has done a 
godlike thing must bear himself like a god. I see 
no way out of it. The people are your sheep till

be very wise, my son, for nothing is left you ex- 
cept the words, and the songs and the worship of 
a god.” And he said “It is a lonely thing to be a god.” 
We realise afresh that a new type of human life 
must find new expression, and demand and make 
new gods, but at the time, that new as they are, 
they cannot escape the old. The Race marches on, 
but it is still the heir of all the ages. Diana, the 
Lady of the Wild Things, who satisfied the Hunter, 
gave place to the Gardeners’ goddess Demeter, the 
Corn Mother, but some, instead of making way for 
others, themselves went through a transforming 
process. Many of the Pagan figures are seen again 
in the shining hosts of the Saints of the Early 
Church. Mercury not only ran on fleet foot for the 
Olympians, but was the radiant messenger of Christ; 
our Christmas festival is a curious mingling of 
heathen and Christian thought; the mistletoe, with 
its Druidical associations, has a place among the 
sweet-smelling hay in the manger of Bethlehem; and 
the Danes who before their conversion to Chris- 
tianity drank to Odin and the Ases, after it drank 
to Our Lord, the “Glorious Company of the Apos- 
tles,” and the Saints. 
Francis Thompson, watching the red sun setting 
in the western sky, and remembering those dim days 
when men hailed it as a god whose shimmering glory 
vanquished night and made the earth a living and a 
radiant thing, writes his Ode to him:

“ Discrowned of homage though yet crowned with 
Taye... 
“Yet ere Olympus thou wast, and a god, 
Though we deny thy nod, 
We cannot spoil thee of thy divinity. 
What know we elder than thee? ”? 
And then he passes through the ages, linking the Sun 
to the God of Christian times... “ Thy straight 
long beam lies steady on the cross” . . . 
“Thou dost image, thou dost follow 
That King Maker of Creation, 
Who ere Hellas hailed Apollo, 
Gave thee, angel-god, thy station ; 
Thou art of Him a type memorial.” 
‘And so... 
“ Birth hath in itself the germ of Death, 
But Death hath in itself the germ of Birth.” ? 
There is, too, an immortal quality about some 
stories which makes them shine undimmed by the 
centuries. Man will never let some heroes die, they 
live in hearts and memories, and are in time of need 
thrown out once more objectively . . . King Arthur 
of the Round Table has left the haunting promise of 
return from the Valley of Avalon; Hiawatha, the 
Great Red Chief, may fulfil his own words and be 
seen again of his faithful people; Roland is not 
dead. A Frenchman, speaking in the twentieth 
1 Ode to the Setting Sun,” Francis Thompson. 
2In Scandinavian folk lore we continually get glimpses of the 
departing and arriving god; it is full of the conflict between them. 
Among other collections, W. A. Cragie’s Scandinavian Folk Lore 
(see Bibliography) has many such stories. The story, “ Pan and 
the Babe,” p. 126, is an example from southern mythology.

century, says... “Through long ages our splen- 
did ancestor, the warrior of warriors, has been seen 
riding over the mountains and hills, across the 
France of Charlemagne and Hugh the Great. At all 
times of national disaster he has risen before the 
people’s eyes, like an omen of victory and glory, 
with his lustrous helmet and sword. He has ap- 
peared and has halted like a soldier archangel over 
the glowing horizon of conflagrations, or the dark 
mounds of battle and pestilence, leaning over his 
horse’s mane, fantastically swaying ... Every- 
where he has been seen, reviving the ideals and the 
prowess of the Past.”* Great Roland can never die! 
In the Christian religion there is a phrase which 
some interpret in a similar way, %.e., “The second 
coming of the Lord.” 
And this is so because the god always struggles 
to find new experiences and expressions in terms of 
man, as truly as the growing aspiration of man 
reflects itself in the god. Is it not equally true that 
. - “God like a wind goes breathing a dream of 
Himself through all,” and “ An honest god is the 
noblest work of man”? If we can realise in some 
way the significance of the gods, our stories about 
them will glow with deeper feeling and though the 
child hearers may know nothing of our studies, they 
will detect and respond to the fuller, richer note 
which we are bound to give in the telling.

  CHAPTER ITI 
ORIGINS: FOLK AND FAIRY LORE 
This chapter shows the Folk Story as a reflection of 
Racial Thought. It concerns itself with fairy lore generally, 
urging a more thorough and literary study of the Little 
People. It ends with a description of a Chart of Fairyland, 
in which the progress of man’s thought is clearly reflected, 
from the Age of Fear to the Romantic Age. 
es the great body of mythological stories 
already referred to, there is the large group of 
Folk Tales which also reflect Racial thought; and 
Fairy lore, some of which may possibly do so too. 
The fac mes and places have 
similar stories goes, as we have seen, to show that 
they are made by the people themselves out of com- 
mon human stuff, and it also shows that there is a 
tendency to think more or less alike in the great and 
deep things of life—there is the same desire and 
need for love and beauty, there is a common con- 
sciousness running below the external differences. 
The plot of the folk tale is very simple, and so are 
the characters. The story is concerned with a search, 
the carrying out of a command or the failure to obey, 
a rescue, an encounter; refrains through the stories 
are... “Nottotouch” ... “Not tolook”... 
“To ask” ... “To find” ... The people of the 
folk tales are known at a glance; the kings and queens 
always wear their crowns; the eldest son and

daughter are not to be compared in beauty, wisdom 
or goodness with the Youngest Best, who is always 
known by the grace and charm that wins all hearts; 
the ugly witch and beggar woman always has a 
triple gift hidden under her unlikely dress. Even 
the person-in-disguise is readily recognised, and 
much of the delight of the folk tale lies in the reali- 
sation that one is in the secret all the time; the dis- 
guise is obvious to us, though the folk people them- 
selves are taken in by it.

nuts, apples, combs, mirrors, sticks, pots and rings

  20 CHILDREN’S STORIES 
Fancy plays about the ordinary, there is the frank 
taking of the everyday things, and the enlargement 
of them in power and significance. Rags and tatters 
are no disgrace, but simply picturesque; black coats 
and gloves are never worn, but cloaks hung from the 
shoulder, and knee breeches tied with gay ribbons 
(the favourite dressing-up properties from the play- 
box). The names of the folk are descriptive and of 
an exquisite art... Goldilocks, Snow White, 
Rose Red, Cap o’ Rushes, Catskin, Prince Charm- 
ing, Prince Fickle; and when the countries have 
names, they are “ East of the Sun, West of the 
Moon,” and “ The Land of Heart’s Desires.” Not 
only are the folk tales simple in plot, treating of 
simple people in a magic way, but the style of the 
telling is simple too; there is directness, often a 
refrain, and a rhyme, for these folk, in common 
with the animals, can speak in verse most readily. 
The Goose Girl cries, 
“Wind, Wind, gently swaying, 
Blow Curdkin’s hat away, 
Let him chase o’er field and wold, 
Till my locks of ruddy gold 
Now astray, and hanging down 
Be combed and plaited in a crown.” 
The little voice within the strange house of cake 
and sugar calls out, 
“Nibbly, Nibbly Mouse, 
Who’s nibbling at my house? ” 
and Hansel and Gretel reply, 
“?Tis Lady Wind that blows 
As round about the house she goes.”
-P-A-G-E-39
  
FOLK AND FAIRY LORE 21 
There is often a triple refrain in the tale, and 
sometimes a sevenfold one. The Fisherman goes 
seven times to the magic fish in the sea to make his 
request : 
“Flounder, Flounder in the sea 
Come, I pray thee, back to me; 
For Dame Isobel my wife 
Begs a favour for thy life.” 
Sometimes the refrain appears with a significant 
difference that intensifies the mood of the story as 
it unfolds. This is the case in the Fisherman story 
above. There is a request for a cottage, a stone cas- 
tle, a king’s palace, an emperor’s palace, the Pope’s 
Vatican . . . and this crescendo is accompanied by 
changes in the sea, which grows from clear and 
sunny blue to green, grey and densest black. 
The Brook in “Little Brother” warns three 
times: 
“ Who drinks of me shall be a tiger... 
Who drinks of me shall be a wolf... 
Who drinks of me shall be a fawn.” ... 
The girl hiding from the old witch cries: 
“ Apple tree, Apple tree, hide me, so the old witch can’t 
find me... 
Oven, Oven, hide me, so the old witch can’t find me... . 
Cow, Cow, hide me, so the old witch can’t find me.” .. . 
In almost all the folk tales this charm of repeti- 
tion is seen. The old witch comes three times to 
Snow White, with different things each time to 
tempt her; Faithful John proves his love three times; 
for three nights the Prince sleeps his enchanted 
sleep in “ East of the Sun and West of the Moon”; 
on three consecutive days the Goose Girl and the

head of the faithful horse Falada hanging over the 
gateway hold their pathetic dialogue: 
“O Falada, ’tis you hang there”... 
She greets him, and he answers: 
“Tis you pass under Princess fair, 
If your mother only knew 
Her heart would surely break in two.” 
These tales may well be called the Day Dreams of 
a primitive people; the commonplace does not exist 
in folk lore, it is a world of romance from start to 
finish, there is no hint of the atmosphere of Sinister 
Street, or the Five Towns. The folk world is like 
the stall of many-coloured fruits in grim and sor- 
did Lady Street,’ it is radiant with colour and 
charm. The author of the folk tales is indeed 
“Everyman,” they bear his distinctive touch; they 
are woven of human stuff by the people, for the 
people; they belong to all ages, and are so abound- 
ing with life itself that they can never die of old 
age. They are shot through with magic and romance 
and belong to the world in its youth. 
We will now consider the fairies, 
“Who are old, old, and gay, 
O so old! 
Thousands of years, thousands of years, 
Tf all were told.” 2 
In discussing their origin we are at once con- 
fronted with many theories. Some hold them to

be real folk of another order to mankind, whose 
business is concerned with nature processes; they are 
the Little People underground. Others think they 
belong more especially to the ether.’ 
Some suggest that fairy belief sprang out of an- 
cestor worship, and has passed through “a_ bril- 
antl) somano TORT the SaaS of the poets”; 
some SS in many of 
the theories, and all Have surely at some time or 
other_asked questi em. 
Did God create fairies, or did man? 
Did they spring ready grown into being, like 
Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden? 
Did they evolve, slowly creeping up from, and 
parallel to, man? 
Had they an existence in the outer world of 
space, or only in the realms of intuition ? 
Did they or do they exist purely in man’s imag- 
ination; and are not the imaginings of one age, 
sometimes created in the world of sense of another 
age? 
Some folk have certainly seen the Little People 
lurking in the twilight; some bowls have been 
emptied of their cream, when set outside the door 
sill at nightfall, and we think of cats or little 
gnomes, according to the kind of people we are! No 
fairy has yet been caught and analysed in a labora- 
tory, nor submitted to the Binet tests, yet that may 
be because they are too quick for us; 
“ Why then should witless man so much misween, 
That nothing is, but that which he hath seen?”

  24 CHILDREN’S STORIES 
Throughout the many theories we may see one 
thing in common, the play of man’s thought upon 
the Little People. We may think of them to some 
degree at any rate as Acts of Creation, appearing in 
due time as imaginative power in man grew, so that 
these dainty frisky beings reflect racial thought, 
emotion, desire. Man has a tendency to translate his 
surroundings according to his mood; the smitten 
trees mourn the death of the deer at Hart Leap 
Well; * the Vale of Cashmere reflects the awful loneli- 
ness of Alastor; * Lucy, the old Cumberland beggar, 
and the contented leech gatherer on the lonely moor 
are imbued with the sense of communion with the 
“Mother of the Unfathomable World.”* Move- 
ment means life to a primitive mind; the flower- 
bell swings in the breeze, and so there must be some 
wee creature inside the cup, small enough to creep 
unseen behind the petals, yet more lovely in form 
than the prettiest little mortal who dances above in 
the sunlight. 
We see the play of the subjective on the objective 
in the appearance of ogres which may well have been 
due to the blending of the real with the unreal, 
helped by natural phenomena and magnified by 
terror. Ogres belong to the dim days when maraud- 
ing sailors visited these coasts and drove the shore- 
dwellers into the dark interior and out beyond on to 
the high moorlands. These were the days of Gren- 
del, the Ogre of Ogres. The fugitives, homeless and 
wild with hunger, would prowl through the desolate 
country, and the pale moonlight mists would mag-

nify them so that these desperate figures looked a 
great deal more terrifying than they really were. 
Fear gave their arms a longer reach; flaming eyes 
and horrid mouths and tails were added, and imag- 
ination working upon the objective created the Ogre. 
Weird and dangerous figures really haunted great 
stretches of country, and hidden in the huge fast- 
nesses of the rocky edges of the moors, would easily 
become the traditional ogre in his castle. He was 
kept alive through the generations by fireside recitals, 
in which individual and racial memory played their 
parts, and finally we find traces of him yet in the 
nursery child’s picture book to-day. All who have 
created a monster in lonely woods from terrifying 
shadows, recognise the possibility in this idea; all 
who have hurried fearfully past the gnarled trunk 
of some old wind-twisted tree, which glimmered in 
the dusk like an evil beast waiting for its prey, know 
the germ of truth here. Babies are stolen; flitting 
shadows are seen dancing on the grass; webs appear 
jewel-bedecked on a frosty morning; singing is heard 
in the leaves of little trees, music in running water, 
and colours flit over the meadows. We have all seen 
and heard these things, and the simple mind at once 
accounts for them in terms of what it knows, and 
with a touch of happy imagination lifts them beyond 
the human into the supernatural realm, so that we 
get a weird blend of the commonplace and the 
mysterious, the subjective and the objective. Then, 
as we travel the centuries, the line between the super- 
natural and the natural grows thinner and thinner, 
and either the bush becomes the burning bush alight 
with glory and mystery, or the botany book holds

the only key, just according to the kind of people we 
are. 
There are many traditions accounting for fairies. 
One speaks of the time when there was war in high 
heaven; the rebels were cast out and fell down to 
the uttermost depth. But some were guilty in a less 
degree, and were not weighted as heavily with their 
sins. They rested_on the earth and became the 
fairies. eir punishment was bitter, however, for 
they have always had to live among mortals, who 
have souls, while they were denied the opportunity 
to return once more to God. This is the fairies’ 
tragedy; their dearest wish seems to be to grow a 
Ce er cae the e Scandinavian legend is similar. It tells of 
heavenly. beings who did not take sides in the great 
condlict,and for thelr “ixewarmness were cast upon 
the earth and doomed to live hidden from the light 
of day and the smile of God. They have no material 
body, and_are seldom seen by mortals, they are the 
“Hidden” or “Hulda” folk, the fairies. 
Another story tells how one day when the world 
was very young, God walked in his garden with his 
two friends, Adam and Eve. They spoke together 
of all the treasures the garden held, and then God 
ked_ Eve about her dear chi > with 
the rest of the treasures, were shown eagerly to Him. And God saw that they were very fair and good to 
look upon. Then God asked Eve if she had any more 
children, or if those that stood before Him were all. 
And Eve said “ All my children stand before you.”

Lore exemplifies this, See Bibliography.

FOLK AND FAIRY LORE 27 
Now Eve told a lie, for she had indeed other children 
who had not been presented. There had not been 
time to wash and tidy all of them when God asked 
for them, so the unwashed ones were hidden away 
out of sight. But God, who sees the hearts of men, 
knew well that Eve, the mother, had told Him a 
falsehood, and answering her, He proclaimed “ Those 
that have been hidden from Me shall be hidden from 
men.” These poor children became the ancestors of 
the fairies, who have always had to live hidden from 
the sight of man, in glens and in the underworld. 
They have power to see mortals though they are 
invisible themselves to the majority, who do not 
desire to see them. 
In these stories there is the definitely traditional 
note, one that fits in with other lore; something that 
belongs to the greater body of literature, thought, 
and belief. The war in high heaven, the fall of 
Lucifer, the invisibility of the fairies, are elements 
that we recognise. They lie in other legendary mat- 
ter; they are interesting and satisfying; they have 
the sense of belonging. They are worth the telling 
and are of an entirely different type to the pretty 
little fancy one meets, i.e., when the first baby 
laughed for the first time, the merry notes rippled all 
over the world in sporting gay fragments which 
became the fairies. 
There are very many kinds of fairy beings, and it 
is interesting to recognise the various characteristics 
which mark them out from one another. We may 
make a rich collection, and as it grows so will our 
dissatisfaction in the use of the vague word “ Fairy ”

There are the nymphs of Greek mythology, 
“Guardians of the sacred floods and of the silver 
fountains ”;* the Dryads of the forests, Oreads of 
the mountains and grottoes, Mermaids, Mermen and 
Nereids among the sea-folk. 
In Scandinavian tales there are the elves of field 
and heath, Brownies and Nissies of the farmsteads 
and church spires. These are as large as little 
children; they dress in grey with red caps; they 
love quiet and the silver moon. 
There are the Trolls and Giants of the North, 
hardy folk; the Bergmen of Denmark, and the 
Dwarfs. There are the little earth sprites, the 
Gnomes, melancholy and very often covetous, and 
there are their gayer little brethren, the Pixies, the 
frolicsome men of the woods. 
Then there are the fairies we know best of all, 
who dance in the moonlight on Midsummer Eve, in 
rings on the green grass. They are the Trooping 
Fairies: 
“Wee folk, good folk, 
Trooping all together 
Green jacket, red cap, 
And white owl’s feather.” ? 
There is the industrious rich Irish Lepracaun or 
Leprahaun. He grows rich at his shoe-making and 
always has one or two crocks of gold, but his riches 
seem to alienate him from his fellows, as sometimes 
happens in the world of mortals, for he is always 
solitary. He can be recognised as the fairy shoe-

maker by his red jacket * with its seven rows of seven 
buttons (the fairies generally wear green doublets). 
The fairies dance so much that there is little wonder 
that they need a special maker of shoes for them, nor 
that he gets rich at his trade ! 
There is our own Jack o’ Lantern, who dances 
over the moors in the heavy mists, enticing unwary 
travellers to their mischief and undoing; and the 
Boggart of the Yorkshire farms. There are many 
different clans among the Little People, and in 
speaking of them we should surely try to distinguish 
between them. Although they differ in many ways, 
there is one persistent activity in which they all 
delight—that of trying to capture a mortal to live 
with them in Fairyland. The race of mortals has a 
strange attraction for them, and perhaps the reason 
is that, having no souls themselves, they think the 
next best thing is to hold some hostage who has 
one. By intermingling with the Sons of God, the 
Little People perhaps hope to mitigate their own 
doom ; at any rate a great part of fairy lore deals with 
stories of changelings, and fairy capture. In the old 
days fairies were dreaded by mortals, who knew the 
danger of being carried off into Fairyland: a very 
significant difference from the modern story which 
generally shows the nursery child as longing to go to 
Fairyland, and having a glorious time there. It is a 
very serious thing indeed to enter those portals and 
to fall under the thrall of the fairy people. La Belle 
Dame has many victims. There is a terrible quality

in the food in Fairyland, for who ever eats of it must 
abide there for many weary years, until sometimes 
the memory of a former life has utterly faded away. 
There is the supernatural lapse of Time, for “The 
power of Time is less than that of a Rhyme, and 
Space is but a Dream.” Here, perhaps, we are akin 
to the child mind which can leap lightly over miles 
and hours in a moment, with the Shoes of the Wind, 
or by putting on the Cap of Darkness. Mortals who 
have been stolen, but are wise enough not to let fairy 
food pass their lips, have found their way back to the 
Jand of mortals again, but their fate is sorrowful; 
like Rip van Winkle, they find themselves unknown, 
or only a vague memory in the minds of some of the 
oldest people. 
“They stole little Bridget, 
For seven years long, 
When she came back again 
Her friends were all gone.” + 
When Oisin kept in Fairyland sees his old forgot- 
ten home in vision, he thinks thrice seven days have 
passed since he was there, but it was three times 
thrice seven years. 
It is only natural that mortals in self-defence 
handed on charms to protect themselves from the 
marauding fairies. A pair of scissors held open had 
the double power of protection, for not only was it 
of metal, but the shape was that of the cross. The 
sign of the cross is inimical to the fairy, and this is 
not to be wondered at. Christianity was no friend 
of the Little People in their soulless state, and so, as

Christianity spread, the fairies faded away. “ Nissies 
have little time to live now in the world,” complained 
the folk of Scandinavia, ‘ because people put a cross 
on everything.” Babies were not safe until they 
were signed with the sign of the cross, and sometimes 
a cross would be painted on the sides and head of the 
cradle to make doubly sure. 
We know, too, that although fairies were able to 
transform common things into treasure, they were 
also bound by laws of their own to restore when the 
right charm was used. They were obliged to 
exchange whatever they had with any mortal who 
offered them something with the words . . . “ Mine 
is yours, and yours ts mine.” A blade of grass picked 
by a mortal and offered with these words could 
redeem a child who was being carried off to Fairy- 
land. 
The power of a name is a marked feature in fairy 
lore; the power of the spoken word is very significant. 
Often it is enough to call aloud the fairy’s name to 
undo the mischief he may have done. The odd 
twinkling figure of Rumpelstiltzkin dances before us 
in illustration of this.t Until the babe was named, 
he was not safe from the fairies. We surely share 
with the Little People the belief in the power of a 
name; we realise its magic. We know how per- 
sonality shrinks when the name is taken away and a 
number is given instead. We know how it is 
heightened when the name of the child is softly 
called in the stillness of the room in the Montessori 
School. It is always disconcerting to be called

by some one else’s name, or a mistreatment of our 
own. 
This magic in a name gives us one of the clues to 
the magic in spells and spoken incantations. In our 
English Church service we have much prayer and 
ritual beginning or ending with the phrase .. . “In 
the Name of .. .” 
The proper name given to trusty and tried objects 
enhances their value and seems to lift them to a 
personality. Huntring was the good sword of 
Unferth, Excalibur, with the jewelled hilt, the sword 
of King Arthur, and Nothung the sword of Siegfried ; 
Leuthing and Droma were the chains forged by the 
Ases in Asgard to bind Fenrir the Wolf, while 
Gleipnir was the silken cord made by the under- 
ground people which finally bound him. It is an 
interesting little exercise to compile a list of such 
things as we come across them in our story telling.* 
The laws governing our emotions and behaviour 
are often reversed with the fairies, who are “not of 
the Race of Adam.” They have a queer sense of 
obligation, judged from our standpoint. If a service 
be rendered them, they at once desert their bene- 
factor. They delight in creeping in the quiet house 
at night to tidy the kitchen and put the things to 
rights for the morning. Yet when in gratitude for 
such service the people of the house make little shoes 
and coats, or leave tiny gifts by way of thanks, the 
little creatures take their gifts with joy and depart, 
1A further study could be made of those things which seem to 
be bound in a magical way with the life of the possessor. Olger 
the Dane’s life was to end when his fiery torch died and Melusina 
in the ‘Legend of Luxemburg,” having finished her enchanted 
needlework, dies, and the city disappears.

never to return or perform their kindly service again. 
Beware, then, of ever thanking a fairy !* 
There is an inconsistency about them. At one 
moment they are happy, friendly, helpful, full of 
glee, and then at the next, teasing, tiresome, hostile, 
coy and shy. Perhaps their own world fails to 
satisfy them for they realise that they have lost the 
smile of God, under which the children of man may 
live in blessedness, and so they envy them. 
Sometimes if a fairy tribe grows mischievous and 
irritating beyond bounds, punishment falls upon it, 
and it is one of the worst imaginable. The fairies 
are driven from their homes and cursed with a rest- 
less spirit which drives them always onward. They 
think “ To-morrow we will return, we will go home 
again.” Yet when the morrow dawns they are 
constrained to press ever onward, till at last, the rest- 
less roaming spirit is worn out. But even then they 
can never really settle down; it is true that the 
wanderers adopt a new country, but it never becomes 
their home, but only their dwelling-place. Mortals, 
too, know that bitter difference which lies between 
a home and a mere place to dwell in. 
“ Every one,” says George Macdonald, “ can detect 
the country forsaken of the fairies ... The dull 
commonplace land, a tract of Matter of Fact, where 
distance is measured by miles, instead of by the 
going” ... and Time by watches, instead of by 
emotion, and where spiders’ webs are only spiders’ 
webs, and grey, instead of glittering webs of gold and 
rainbow threads tangled all about with jewelled 
beauty.

The fairies are associated with the world of Nature, 
and for all we know may be busy in helping Mother 
Nature in her faithful work of season bearing, and so 
should earn the grateful thanks of mortals who can 
only take what comes. The making of sweet Spring, 
with her growing flowers and bird song, of Summer 
and Autumn and Winter, should keep the fairy people 
radiantly happy. Fairy Gold* gives pages from the 
Little People’s Diary, which shows that they have 
much more to do than dance in their little shoes, or 
tease and torment mankind... .

We rouse the lark at morn, and the pretty Echoes

of the spring, and tend upon the birth of all sweet 
buds; and the pastoral cowslips are our friends; 
and the pansies and violets, like nuns; and the 
quaking harebell is in our wardship; and the 
hyacinth . . . We are kindly things; and it is we 
that sit at evening and shake rich odours from sweet 
boughs . . . We flit in sweet dreams across the 
brains of infancy, and conjure up a smile upon the 
soft lips to beguile the careful mother, while its 
little soul is fled for a brief minute or two to sport 
with our youngest fairies . . . We are small foresters 
that live in woods, training the young boughs in 
graceful intricacies, with blue snatches of the sky 
between; we frame all shady roofs and arches rude; 
and sometimes when we are plying our tender hatches 
men say that the tapping woodpecker is nigh, and it 
is we that scoop the hollow cell of the squirrel, and 
carve quaint letters upon the rind of trees.” . . .

Robin Goodfellow adds a word on his own behalf. 
... “Alas, a little random elf am I, born in one of 
Nature’s sports; a very weed, created for the simple, 
sweet enjoyment of myself, and for no other purpose, 
worth or need, that I could ever learn. ’Tis I that 
bob the angler’s idle cork, till the patient man is 
ready to breathe a curse. I steal the morsel from 
the gossip’s fork; . . . I am a pinch of lively dust 
to frisk upon the wind; a tear would make a puddle 
of me; and so I tickle myself with the lightest straw, 
and shun all griefs that might make me stagnate. 
This is my small philosophy.” 
Fairy folk no doubt help mortals to spin the wheel 
of life around, and yet there are many too wise to 
believe in them ! Most are indifferent to the Little 
People, or if we think of them at all, treat them 
superficially, not realising the significance of their 
appearance in Racial life. 
“Englishmen care nothing now 
For elves beneath the hawthorn bough.” 
“The horns of elfland grow fainter and fainter ” 
for Prospero has thrown away his magic wand, Ariel 
has gone on holiday, and Merlin is asleep. ‘ Where,” 
laments Francis Thompson,* 
“is the Naiad ’mid her swordéd sedge? 
The Nymph wan-glimmering by her wan fount’s 
verge?

With whistling tresses dank athwart her face, 
And all her figure posed in lithe Circean grace? 
Why withers their lament? 
Their tresses tear-besprent, 
Have they sighed hence with trailing garment-hem? 
O sweet, O sad, O fair, 
I catch your flying hair, 
Draw your eyes down to me, and dream on them! 
A space, and they fleet from me ”.   
We have heard the hearty response to the imploring 
request, “Say you believe in fairies !”* But most 
of us have answered “ Yes, we do !” merely out of a 
lingering regret that we personally should be respon- 
sible for the death of a fairy. “I fear that Puck is 
dead . . . Aye, Puck is fled.” ? 
There is an old prophecy among the fairies, that 
their existence shall end when mortals cease to 
believe. Already “the Race of Nymphs” has “ ut- 
terly disappeared before the chilling touch of man’s 
incredulity.” * It certainly is true that we create 
and keep alive by thought and faith. “There are 
no dead,” the old grandmother tells Tyl Tyl and his 
sister, “ for when you think of us, we live,” * and as 
the children ask after their dead sisters and brothers, 
the seven little ones, “like a set of Pan’s pipes, come 
out of the cottage one by one.” “Here they are, 
here they are ! As soon as you think of them, as 
soon as you speak of them, they are there, the dar- 
lings!” cries old Granny Tyl. 
We certainly catch glimpses of many of our philo-

sophies as we study fairy lore, whatever our particular 
view of fairy origin may be. We have seen that the 
race has a great mass of story material which it has 
made for itself; in the very deepest sense, the race 
possesses them as a creator possesses his creation. 
Moreover the creature is an expression of the creator, 
and the stories not only belong to the race, but reflect 
it. We are conscious of the onward trend of hu- 
manity, man has with pain unfolded latent powers, 
and though he sometimes seems to lose much that he 
has gained, he makes the slow cycles and reappears 
each time higher on the spiral, as he mounts to the 
God above him, by the power of the God within him. 
We therefore expect stories to show at any rate some 
hint of progression too, and we realise with joy that 
whenever dragons rage the dragon-slayer follows, that 
man tormented by the phantom Fear, becomes master 
of his fate, through faith in a name, or a talisman.* 
The dank weeds grown in darkness give gradual 
place to the fine flowers of courage and confidence; 
and the sweet blossoms of faith and love grow more 
thickly as the sun shines longer; devils begin to 
draw in their horns, and grow into gods of beneficent 
powers, who may be first feared, then entreated, and 
finally worshipped and loved; the Avenger becomes 
the Helper, the Lawgiver, a Father; the misery of a 
rain-soaked sodden earth is relieved by the shining 
of a star in a clear sky on Christmas nighé, and the 
weary hearts of men are restored to beauty and joy 
by the coming of a little Child.

the Halls of Asgard, give place to self-conquest in the Arthurian 
eycle, and the Quest of the Holy Grail.

It is interesting to gather and try to reset dis- 
tinctive groups of stories into the history of the race, 
to illustrate this, and a delightful chart of “ Faery 
Lands Forlorn”? helps to this end; it is full of 
suggestion for the student story teller intent upon 
the inner significance of the stories he tells. 
The first thing to be noticed is the bold dark 
character on the left as compared to the light delicate 
colouring on the right. It is as if gleaming mother- 
of-pearl lay against a mane of dank dark seaweed. 
They are as different from each other as the tender 
beauty of the early morning sky, full of shimmering 
light, radiant with rose and gold, is different from 
black threatening banks of heavy clouds which roll 
up sullenly on dark and stormy winter nights. 
This contrast is full of significance, showing as it 
does the progress of Racial ideas, from the dark age of 
Fear and Superstition to the bright lands of Romance 
and the shining age of Aspiration. We shall naturally 
look for Grendel’s Cave among the seaweed to the 
left, somewhere along the rocky shores where great 
whirlpools swirl . . . It must be here, where a dark 
cape juts out marked Ogre’s Tongue, or under the 
high cliffs where Were Wolves stand glaring out to 
sea. 
Travelling North, we come to the Land of the 
Giants, and catch a glimpse of them striding across 
the sky, with clouds enwrapping their bodies, and 
their heads beyond the sky itself, for they have 
broken right into the border of runes and devices that 
run around the map !

Mariners.” 
But we have stayed long enough in this awful 
country, and we will go towards the East, where the 
light is growing steadily brighter. Here are green 
pastures with faerie flocks, Will o’ the Wisp, Rapun-

rise one above the other from the magic sea, and

  CHAPTER III 
THE PLACE OF STORIES IN THE LIFE OF THE CHILD 
This chapter is concerned with the following: 
(1) The place and significance of the story in the life of 
the individual. 
(a) The story reveals by separating and uniting. 
(b) It reveals us to ourselves, and our fellows to us. 
(2) Fairy and folk stories in the life of the child in 
particular. 
(a) The child’s attitude to fairy lore. 
(b) The deeper significance of myth and folklore in 
the child’s life. 
TORIES_drawn from mythological folk and 
fairy sources, as well as-other types of stories, 
are mirrors-in_which we see, not only reflections of 
Racial_Thought, but those of the individual listener 
and teller too. We see owr-contemporaries, ourselves ; 
the whole drama_is writ small and whole, motives 
and springs.of conduct grow clearer as we see them 
in the true proportion which a well-constructed story always.gives. Words often fail to make us known 
to each other and to ourselves; we are but dimly 
aware of certain attitudes and sentiments until they 
are called out by the reflection in the mirror, by the 
portrayal of another’s inner life. Then we see 
clearly, our loneliness fades; we are comforted and

reassured, for here we meet one who knows about it 
too. A child will sometimes nod his head gravely 
as he recognises himself in the hero of the story he 
is hearing. This glow of recognition is known to all 
of us, as we now and then meet our thoughts in a 
novel or essay. Children, and we too, clasp hands with others like 
ourselves across the ages. We hear the same note 
as Walt Whitman... 
. Stanger you in passing, meet me, and desire 
to speak to me, why should you not speak to me, 
and why should I not speak to you ?” for 
“Our delight is in realising ourselves outside us. 
. . . When I feel I am truer in some one else than 
myself, then I am glad, for the one in me realises its 
truth of unity, by uniting with others, and there is 
dis Joy.” * >... 
There is the glow of recognition, and it is there- 
fore true that we are all poets when we read a poem 
well, for this is because we feel the truth embodied 
in the poem or story, we get as it were a “ great free 
glance into the very deeps of thought.” 
We may take a very simple little illustration of 
this, in a much slighter connection. Have we not 
all at some time or other been like the old woman in 
the nursery story, whose whole day was spoilt 
because her pig would not get over the stile? A 
series of beautifully fitting plans is made of no ac- 
count, and indeed effectively stops all activity, and 
we must wait until we find the one essential; then, 
and not till then, can our progress be continued ! 
Not only do stories make our own selves clearer

The animal stories known and loved in all our 
nurseries again show well-marked types . . . the 
cruel wolf, the sly fox, the timid rabbit, the stupid 
ostrich, the loyal dog. Stories introduce us to a 
crowd of friendly people who will “in their turn 
form links with other friendly ones, people we can 
laugh with, people we can weep over, and in some 
way or other genially relate ourselves to.” 
~~ Stories show us life written small ; we see it whole; 
we see events worked out; we see to-day.as. the out-

making the future . . . we realise that it is because 
of this,that that is bound to happen. Stories present 
ideals and_standards of conduct, towards which we 
adopt.adefinite attitude. 
In taking stories with the older children we find 
ourselves going deeper down through the story itself 
to the underlying-motives,.and so by-and-by we are 
discussing the ethical_bearings of the situation. It 
was interesting to watch this development in a Middle

right to keep her word to Walter when he demanded 
the life of the little child 2 An amusingly hot dis- 
cussion was waged by these school girls of eleven and 
twelve, on the degree of allegiance which husbands 
and wives (in the persons of Walter and Griselda) 
should demand from each other. Then a more 
thoughtful speech, pointing out that as there were 
no husbands or wives in the classroom we were per- 
haps talking about things of which we knew little, 
brought us to the nearer question of what we should 
have done in Griselda’s place. Was she right to 
keep her word, given in innocence, when it meant the 
life of her little child ? Ought one to obey, when the 
promive has been given, even if told to do something 
wrong ? The sense of loyalty is very strong in the 
middle school, and twenty-five girls thought Griselda 
fully justified, because of her promise: “Even if 
you tell me to die, I will obey.” Some thought her 
wrong in acquiescing, and said that obedience was 
only right so long as the one in authority was reason- 
able. Two girls could not decide at all. Here we 
were recognising, probably for some of the girls for 
the first time, the conflict of ideals, the subtle differ- 
ence between the external obedience and inner com- 
pulsion. Griselda and Abraham both chose obedi- 
ence to their vows, even when it involved the life of 
their dearest, stifling their instinct to protect and 
save life, in order to obey to the letter. There are 
certainly some Griseldas and Abrahams, and there 
are others who would have picked up their children 
in their arms and run away from the command to 
sacrifice them; common-sense and parental respon- 
sibility and love would have urged them so that they.

would have acted unhesitatingly and unthinkingly 
in the rescue of their children. There are the two 
types always with us, and we found them in our 
classroom during the literature lesson. 
In reading Pilgrim’s Progress, it is interesting to 
see how differently each accepts the story; some as 
narrative, others with an inkling of the underlying 
truth; these come to you afterwards with a tenta- 
tive shy inquiry—“ Are Christian and Hope real 
people ? Are Vanity Fair, Slough of Despond real 
places ?”” Perhaps the only possible answer is 
“Well, do they seem real to you ?” and leave it 
there, giving a new test to the growing child,— 
the subjective rather than the objective. Whatever 
our philosophy may be, we realise in the Pilgrim 
ourselves in many moods; we are familiar with some 
of the stages of the journey, and the recognition of 
this makes the mere telling or reading of the story 
to children a refreshment to ourselves. “The eye” 
indeed “sees what it brings with it the power of 
seeing.” 
The story of “ The Proud Darning Needle” * was 
read to sixty children of ten and eleven years of age, 
in an elementary school. They were asked whether 
they thought it a silly story, a funny one, a wise 
story, or pure nonsense. One child said he considered 
it a wise story; one said, “It tells of one who was 
proud above himself,” and one said “It teaches you 
not to be proud.” The rest thought it was either 
silly, funny or amusing. Certainly they laughed 
during the reading to warrant that decision. It was 
left at that; even with a little explanatory remark

during the reading, the real essence was not detected 
in this case. The point, however, remains the same 
—that_ stories illuminate life, and children see and 
are grateful for that illumination when they are 
ready for it. 
Stories shift the centre of interest from the self 
outwards; they often release us from the prison of 
our own thoughts, and in this way they illuminate. 
Sense may well form the prison walls; we dare 
not depend entirely on the evidence of the senses for 
the release of the spirit. . . . “ If the sun and moon 
should doubt, they’d immediately go out.” We 
need to have made clear to us the experience of 
others, for in this knowledge the spirit gains liberty 
of its own. The neighbour may help to set the spirit 
free. The books and poems and stories we cherish 
in memory; the melodies and rhythms that swing 
through the day’s work; the sound of falling rain on 
leaves; the sudden use of a familiar word in a new 
connection, giving it richer meaning; the great il- 
Tumination which comes when apparently different 
and widely separate subjects as we know them, run 
together and merge at Infinity; the life of flowers; 
[Re joy of colour; the warmth of companionship; 
these are some of the open windows through which 
we escape from our prisons. “To know something 
of the romance of the world, and of the journeys 
of the spirit is the right of every child.” Who so

There are, however, many different types of stories, 
and although these foregoing arguments apply to 
stories in the mass, there is much controversy as to 
whether Fairy stories should be told. In this con-

Mrs. Meynell reminds us that (ildren love a fairy

they think it untrue, and because it makes no fraudu-

they are delighted to put aside while they ‘ pretend.

“Fairies,” which seems to bear out the “ Let’s pre-

At the time when the conversation which is here 
recorded took place, little K., then three years and five 
months old, knew nothing about fairies. Her father and 
mother had deliberately kept from her all kinds of 
fantastic rhymes and stories in the firm belief that until 
there is some glimmering of the distinction between the 
real and the imaginary, such rhymes and stories only 
disturb the first developments of mind and retard its 
proper progress. In doing so they had no desire to con- 
fine her to a scientifically exact view of the universe.

world around her must take mythological form, and were 
willing to give her all the help they could in constructing 
a mythology for herself. But they were conscious of the 
risk of introducing her prematurely to the somewhat 
capricious world in which live fairies and giants and the 
other strange beings about whom it is customary to tell 
young children; and they preferred to wait till they had 
reason to think that she was ready for the new way of 
thinking and imagining which this kind of knowledge 
involved. 
The talk about fairies began quite spontaneously, when 
Mother and K. were busy at work. In acknowledgment 
of some small service done by the child, Mother remarked 
(as she had done occasionally before) : “ That is a kind 
little fairy.” At once came the question: “ What is a 
fairy?” Mother hesitated a moment, then decided that 
the time had come when she might know something about 
fairies. The fairies, she explained, were kind little 
people, who lived in the woods, and she told her about 
the wonderful fairy rings that could be seen there. K. 
was immensely interested and began to ask questions. 
What kind of people were they? What did they do? 
Where did they sit? What did they eat? 
She was told that they lived in the flowers, and ate 
the honey in them. Then she took a new line in her 
questioning. Had they babies? “Oh, yes!” Mother 
said. Who took care of the babies? “Their mothers, 
of course.” What did they eat? “They got honey, 
too,” she was told. She nodded approval. “That is 
good for babies. Mother, did I get honey when I was a 
baby?” When told “ No,” she asked: “ Why did I not 
get honey?” “Because you were a human baby, not 
a fairy one,” answered Mother. “ What is ‘human’ ?” 
she asked immediately. Mother explained that 
“human” means “belonging to man and woman,” and 
the answer seemed to be found satisfactory. Then a 
new problem arose. “ Where do the fairy babies sleep? ” 
She was told that they slept in the bell flowers. Her eyes
-P-A-G-E-70
    52 CHILDREN’S STORIES 
shone with delight at this news. “I shall go and look 
for the fairy babies in the flowers,” she said, and she 
repeated the remark several times. 
Then: “What do these fairies do?” Mother told 
her they did all sorts of kind things to people. “ Tell 
me what kind things they would do,” she said. “ Sup- 
pose,” said Mother, “a little girl was going through the 
woods and had lost her doll, they might help her to find 
it.” “Would she see them?” she asked. “No.” 
“Tell me another kind thing!” “Suppose,” said 
Mother again, “a horse had put its foot in a hole, and 
could not get it out, they might help him.” “ Would 
the horse know?” she asked. “No,” Mother answered, 
“the horse and the man would not know. They would 
think that the horse had given a very hard pull.” 
A moment later, she threw down a crust she had been 
eating. “I shall look the other way,” said Mother, “ and 
perhaps a wee kind fairy will come and eat up the brown 
crust.” K. immediately picked up the crust and ate it. 
Mother then turned to an imaginary fairy in the corner 
of the room and said, “'Thank you, kind fairy.” K. ran 
into the corner towards which Mother had bowed, and 
said, “Say it again.” “ The kind little fairy,” answered 
Mother, “ would pick up the crust and say nothing about

In those five lines we can see the two strands. 
In Temple Thurston’s The World of Wonderful 
Reality, we hear two people talking in a gondola one 
evening. One speaks of the life his companion might 
have led... . “Without dreams... . All your 
life you would have been awake with facts, staring 
at them as one lies and stares into the darkness 
through a sleepless night.” ... The other asks: 
“Do ge think that the whole of life is a crease: 2 
That we've got to sleep through it all.’ 
Suddenly through the blue darkness as they ey an 
orange light glitters in a far window across the 
lagoon. . . . “In that room” said the first speaker, 
“some one is going to bed,” and as if to prove the 
words, the light suddenly dies, swallowed up in the 
darkness. . . . “ They’ve gone to bed. . . . All the 
tiring physical facts they’ve put away from them. 
They’ve thrown them aside from all contact with 
their body . . . just their clothes . . . flung on the 
chair. When the sun shines to-morrow morning, 
they'll wake again, and begin another day. . 
Steal that man’s sleep, set him to work with his 
hands all night, and his body will die of it. 
Well . . . Minds die. . . . Without sleep, without 
dreams, your soul dies. A materialist is a man who 
never dreams, because he never sleeps. It is always 
day with him. You’d have been a materialist if 
you’d married like that. The fact would have kept 
you awake all your life through. It would have been 
the insomnia of your soul.”

choosing them carefully; and then let us steep our-

How wistfully Edmund Gosse speaks of his story- 
less childhood* ... “The rapture of cajoling a 
story before bedtime out of my mother or nurse was 
unknown to me. Never in all my early childhood 
did any one address the affecting preamble, ‘ Once 
upon a time.’ I was told about missionaries, but 
never about pirates; I was familiar with humming 
birds, but I never heard of fairies. Jack the Giant 
Killer, Rumpelstilskin and Robin Hood were not of 
my acquaintance, and, though I understood about 
wolves, Little Red Riding Hood was a stranger, 
even by name... I think my parents were in 
error to exclude the imaginary from my outlook 
upon facts. They desired to make me truthful; 
the tendency was to make me positive and scep- 
tical.”

There is now the consideration of the deeper sig- 
nificance of the myth and folk story in the life of 
the child. Folk lore.is the day dream of primitive 
peoples, a dream where suppressed desires have full 
play; there is the hunger for love and beauty, but 
more often for success and riches, and there is little 
discrimination in the means by which these are 
achieved. It may_be by deceit, and stealing, it may 
be by just.alucky meeting. Because these stories 
belong to the childhood of the world, should they be 
found in our nurseries to-day ? 
There was much in primitive times that has been 
gradually trodden under foot by the traveller as he 
advances, because his outlook grows wider and 
higher, his vision keener, his self-control stronger. 
The absorbed little child instantly responds to the 
primitive claim of the folk tale;* it is immediately 
accepted, incorporated into the self. The child 
instantly sets out on his personal journey, but with 
his back to the light, as he travels down to the Racial 
past, so obviously his own too .. . Is the journey 
worth the taking ? Is it a perilous one to travel ? 
Is the destination desirable ? Do we want the little 
traveller to arrive in the Kingdom of Unsuppressed 
Desire, of Licence rather than Liberty? Will our 
fresh, eager, little traveller become travel-stained and 
worn, unable to keep the two worlds in which he 
lives apart, 7.¢., the conventional twentieth century 
and the land of folk lore of a primitive past ? The 
folk stories are so alive that they may not let him 
alone. The majority of children apparently outgrow

them; they have played their part and a vigorous 
healthful new age draws on; but these stories seem 
to take a deeper hold on some tender natures, in- 
fluencing them to an astonishing degree. They seem 
to keep them in their childhood, casting a spell upon 
them, so that mental, moral, and spiritual growth is arrested, and this tends to their serious undoing in 
later years. An illustration of this process is given 
in the bibliography. Miss Drummond, in her book 
about her little niece Margaret,? condemns the folk 
and fairy tale for somewhat similar reasons. ‘The 
egoism of the child,” she contends, “an egoism which 
is not to be called selfish, is pandered to in the worst 
way by many fairy tales.” She speaks of Tom Tit 
Tot, saying, “Stories of the type referred to should 
be banished from our nurseries.” .At_any rate, for 
the child of romantic tendencies,-who.finds_a diffi- 
culty in distinguishing fact from fiction when he is 
of an age to do so, she urges that stories be chosen 
with special care and be strictly limited in quantity. 
Yet may we not distinguish in our folk lore some 
noble elerients too ? Although many people achieve 
success_by foul or silly methods, yet.Cinderella had 
to work hard all day before she went to the ball 
at night, and we hear of the horrible. dragon being 
killed by Valiant Heart; of evil charms being 
broken by love and sacrifice; of doors unlocked and 
beauty set free from a loathsome form, through de- 
votion and steady endurance. We may surely dis- 
tinguish between the Sleeping Beauty and Puss in

Boots, St. George and the Dragon and Tom Tit Tot. 
While, without doubt, there is a mass of primitive 
stuff too doubtful to use, there are lying in the same 
mesh lovely strands which lead man up to God. The 
Sleeping Beauty, St. George and the Dragon, and 
many others of our finest folk tales, bear the same 
message as the old saint, Thomas 4 Kempis: 
“ Great is love, and a great good in every way, for 
it alone maketh every burden light, and every rough 
place smooth. For it carries a burden without being 
burdened, and makes all that is bitter sweet and 
savoury . . . Love aspires to rise upwards and will 
not be held back by things beneath . . . Love com- 
plains not of impossibility, because it thinks that it 
may and can do all things . . . It is equal therefore 
to anything, and it performs and bringeth many 
things to pass, where he that loves not faints and 
fails.” 
Should we not then try to emphasise these higher 
themes, running like shining threads through the 
dark mesh ? Cannot the little child’s self leap to 
recognise the beauty, the love, by which he is gener- 
ally surrounded ? Perhaps that is the next business 
of the story teller—to consider how to give the story 
with the light shining so brightly through, that the 
hearer is enchanted and lifted by this, rather than 
called down to lower levels. 
It should be remembered, too, that the possible 
dangenof the effect of hearing the-folk-tale may lie, 
not so much in the story_itselé-es-in-the.excess of day 
dreaming consequent—upon—the-hearing. It is the 
guardian’s concern to keep a watchful, though un- 
obtrusive, e eye -upon-tho-day-dreaming child, and to

arrange healthful activities which lead away from 
the contemplation of ‘se. 
Whether we decide to tell fairy and folk stories to 
our children or not, we cannot afford to neglect the 
study of them. “ Day dreams will throw light on 
fairy tales, and (what will interest the teacher per- 
haps more intimately) a comparative study of fairy 
tales and their special or typical patterns will throw 
light upon the day dreams and fantasies of chil- 
dren.” + 
Folk lore and myth, however, are but sections of 
the great body of stories we may use, and the argu- 
ments in favour of the art of story telling hold, for 
the children of men still hunger for stories. 
To sum up—stories deliver us from ourselves, re- 
leasing us from the prison-house of sense ;, carrying 
us beyond the bounds of time andspace, they make 
every desert “ blossom as the rose.” 
The paradox is true, moreover, that, in the escape 
from self, the self isfound again; for we have all at 
some time thrilled when some, until now, half-sus- 
pected truth breaks full-splendoured upon us, and,

‘ THE TECHNIQUE OF STORY TELLING 
(1) The necessity of a sense of reality, involving the 
ability to “edit” stories. 
(2) The place of description. 
(83) Repetition and rhythm. 
(4) The style 
(5) Various approaches. 
(6) Analysis of the story. 
(7) The play of fancy. 
(8) A reminder as to the listener and the teller’s stand- 
point. 
E now come to the question of technique, of 
how to gain the power to tell a story so that the 
scene lives. As in all crafts, there must be the 
recognition of laws and practices which produce 
certain results. Yet beyond this type of knowledge 
there is the deeper creative wisdom, an incommuni- 
cable inspiration, without which laughter cannot ring 
true or joy radiate. Like “how-to-be-good,” the 
less said about this part the better, for we learn 
through doing, and no second-hand instruction is of 
use. A little consideration, however, of some of the 
general rules and practices should be useful, and 
may shorten the way to success, especially with the 
preliminary warning not to be too occupied with the 
nets so that we forget the fishing. 
1. The sense of reality and conviction is the first 
60
-P-A-G-E-79
TECHNIQUE OF STORY TELLING 61 
essential. The story.must—be~—thoroughly known, 
believed in, and enjoyed by the teller;.and it must 
for the time being possess him. Only after it has 
been chosen (and sometimes it seems as if it were the 
other way, and that the story actually claims the 
teller), studied, thought about, and allowed to sink 
into the self, is it ready to be shared . . . not just 
passed on, but really shared. The right note must 
be struck so certainly that it is heard by the listener 
as clearly as by the teller. He must then live in the 
story, and it is interesting to note the different ways 
in which this can be done. Some people see the 
action of the story, and tell it as an observer; others 
participate—do not see, but actually feel, the moods 
of which they are telling. It is an experiment worth 
making to work over a story several times, sometimes 
as a listener and watcher and sometimes as an actor, 
and to notice how the words alter in a most signifi- 
cant way. 
The story must then be edited, amplified, cut, and 
sometimes rearranged according to the needs of the 
children. “The King of the Golden River” * was 
told many times one summer to different large classes 
of poor children who came to a London Vacation 
School, and each time it was told the homely part, 
the cooking of the leg of mutton, was increasingly 
dwelt upon, while the exquisite lily with its dew, 
growing on the mountain side, had less attention 
given to it. In response to an offer to tell some

plays upon the theme that pleases best. We may 
safely spend time on details well within the child’s 
experience . . . Tom the Water-baby takes sweets 
from the ones ; Pandora longs to open the for- 
bidden box. In animal stories we can get instant 
sympathy, beyond the actual delight children have 
in hearing about animals, by setting forth some 
situation analogous to their own experience. Little 
Cotton Tail’s admonition by her mother awakes a 
response at once. Ernest Thompson Seton, Jack 
London, Henri Fabre, are all able to make their 
readers live the lives of the creatures they write 
about; our interest swings between the pursuer and 
the pursued, we are torn in our anxiety over the 
needs of both. 
In the telling of biography (mixed as some of it is 
with legend) we must present a living person. In 
telling of Hereward the Wake we must think less of 
doling out facts and a string of narrative, than of 
making him a hero of flesh and blood, with whom 
we can exult and suffer in his triumphs and defeats. 
It is only as we personally feel the thrill of the 
ambush in the Fens that we shall be able to present 
Hereward as a living man to these twentieth-century 
children sitting in their safe school rooms. The sense 
‘of reality is essential. 
2. The place of description, as distinguished from 
narrative, must be appreciated. The younger. the 
listener, the less the description and the more direct 
the narrative should be. The story is the thing, and 
the sooner it is started the better; the traveller must

meet his adventures the moment he has closed the 
door behind his back; the bean is no sooner planted. 
than it grows high and strong enough to carry Jack 
to an enchanted over-world. In telling the story of 
the Little Tailor of Gloucester, we may vary the 
opening considerably according to the age of our 
listeners. In Beatrix Potter’s version* it has a 
delightful beginning for older children, but in giving 
the story to little ones the tailor should be brought 
in as immediately as possible, stitching the beautiful 
coat, and then, as he stitches, a little description 
may well be given of the coat itself. This is the way 
the story often opens: “In the time of swords and 
periwigs, and full-skirted coats with flowered lapels 
' —when gentlemen wore ruffles and gold-laced waist- 
coats of paduasoy and taffeta...” Here we get 
a description of the most important object in the 
story, it is true, but at present the human interest is 
lacking; and the version for the youngest children 
might begin: “ A tailor sat in the window of a little 
shop in Westgate Street, cross-legged on a table, 
from morning to night...” It needs some one 
older than the little child (who would be interested 
vastly in the rest of the story) to appreciate the 
descriptive account of the coat of olden days where 
the interest is centred on that rather than on the 
tailor or the mice. It is some time before the story 
moves along and shows people doing things. 
The folk tale is our best model for the simple 
construction of stories with the minimum of descrip- 
tion. There are the three parts, (1) the beginning, 
(2) the middle, and (3) the end, and we know when 
1See Bibliography, p. 170.
-P-A-G-E-82
  64 CHILDREN’S STORIES 
each section is due by the phrasing, and this expecta- 
tion adds to the pleasure. Almost the only de- 
scriptions of people that we need in the course of 
these stories are supplied by the words good, beauti- 
ful, bad, old, ugly. 
Description is, of course, very necessary to the 
right understanding of a situation. There is the 
picture of the Downs and Forest which must be vis- 
ualised before we can understand the story of “ The 
Knife and the Naked Chalk.”? Such stories are 
more suitable for older children, and judgment must 
be brought to bear from this point of view. The 
problem is so to arrange the necessary descriptive 
matter that it helps instead of clogging or hindering 
the flow of the story. It should lie intimately within 
the narrative itself, and this work should be done 
during preparation. The whole ground must be 
very carefully gone over and the obscure made 
plain; a simple description, woven into the actual 
story, of an unfamiliar word or object will forestall 
questions . . . In the Cinderella story the pumpkin 
might be introduced in terms of description: 
1 The traditional phrase ‘“ Once upon a time,” leads straightway 
to the characters—as—‘‘a man had three sons,” or— “a woman 
said to her daughter,’—and this short introduction in its turn 
brings us immediately to the heart of the story where people are 
busy all the time, drawing water from the well, setting forth on a 
journey, cooking, spinning, sailing over seas, and engaging dragons. 
The end is quite obvious—the phrasing warns that it approaches. 
“For the third time” ... Now all will be revealed, the good 
are rewarded and the wicked (in most cases) punished. 
Three delightful beginnings are “ Once upon a time,” “ Well, there 
was once,” and “ Once upon a time, it wasn’t in my time, it wasn’t 
in your time, and it wasn’t in any one else’s time.” And the end- 
ing, “And they all lived happily ever after,” or “And they may be 
living now, for all I know,” or “ That is the last I saw of them,” 
finishes the story off in the best way possible. 
2 See p. 86.
-P-A-G-E-83
  TECHNIQUE OF STORY TELLING 65 
“Cinderella saw the pumpkin, ten times bigger 
than the biggest orange, ten times more golden than 
the brightest orange . . .” and so on—actually giv- 
ing the description in terms of the story and woven 
into its texture. It is a fine art to give descriptive 
names, and this should be done as much as possible. 
Silver-Spot, Yaller Dog, Rose-Red, Lionheart, ete. ; 
and who would not dwell in the Islands of the Blest 
or the Country of the Ever Young ? 
It is better to give description to little children in 
several short sentences, each containing a clear, 
simple image, rather than to give a more complicated 
sentence with several images, because, as children 
listen to the story teller, they are engaged in the proc- 
ess of constructive imagination, and are apt to lose 
or confuse their images, if they are kept too far 
apart: For instance, it is easier to “make the pic- 
ture ” as one listens to (1) “It was a little PUPPY; 
black and tan, and he was shivering with cold . 
than (2) “ It was a poor litile shivering black end 
tan puppy . . .” because in the second case we were 
kept in suspense so long. 
3. Repetition and Rhythm add very much to the 
enjoyment of the story. Real delight lies here, in 
the attitude of expectation, recognition and fulfilled 
expectation. There is, too, the charm of pure sound,* 
1In the story of St. Christopher we add greatly to the charm by 
reiterating the travellers’ cry across the stream as they call for the 
Giant Ferryman, “ Offero! Offero!” making of the final O, a long 
musical note, faintly heard; and the story may very well end with 
the cry, ‘‘ Christofero! Christofero” dwelling again on the “0.” 
The significance in the change of name must be felt; it is “ Christ 
Bearer” now that he has carried his heavenly traveller over the 
water. See also the several refrains in “ Huffi,” p. 121, and the 
note on W. B. Yeats’ story in the bibliography, p. 176.

as, for instance, in alliteration. Take these away 
from the Just So Stories and their delight is 
halved. “The great, grey-green, greasy Limpopo 
River .. .” in “The Elephant’s Child,” and the 
“Dingo, Yellow Dog, Dingo...” in “Old Man 
Kangaroo.” Some of the old nursery rhymes and 
stories, especially those of the cumulative type, have 
the jingle of repetition through them all the way, 
such as in “ The House that Jack Built,” “The Old 
Woman and Her Pig,” and “Billy Goat Gruff.” 
“Tom, Tom, the Piper’s Son,” is a far more attrac- 
tive person than The Piper’s Son, Tom. Many fairy 
stories in the Andrew Lang collection, if they are 
given at all, should surely be worked up to give this 
enjoyment; they should be much expanded to the 
ample third refrain. “The Goose Girl,” “The 
Magic Cake,” “Little One-Eye, Two-Eyes, Three- 
Eyes” are only a few of the examples from the 
Fairy Books. Unless we do this we rob the story 
of half its beauty and fascination, and our hearers 
of the thrill of recognition and of the cumulative 
effect. 
Stories from the Bible, such as the contest between 
Baal’s prophets and Elijah in the appearance of fire 
and water in the trenches; little Samuel waking in 
the night with his obedient answer, “Here am I”; 
the refrain from the drama of Job, “And I alone 
am left to tell it...” are examples of this tech- 
nique. The dialogue between Abraham and God over 
the fate of the wicked cities grows tremendously in 
interest and literary value as the numbers run down, 
varying the refrain, “ For the sake of fifty, forty-five, 
forty, thirty, twenty, ten . . . I will spare the city.”

Oscar Wilde gives the beautiful story The Happy 
Prince in rhythmic prose. When the reader aban- 
dons himself completely to the rhythm, his listeners 
express astonishment afterwards that the form is 
prose—“ for the flow is just like verse” they say. 
Tagore’s English translations of his own songs are 
full of the same joy. 
To finish this long list of illustrations, let us read 
this aloud: “ Then Orpheus took his harp and began 
his magic song. ‘ How sweet it is to ride upon the 
surges, and to leap from wave to wave, while the 
wind sings, cheerful in the cordage, and the oars 
flash fast among the foam; how sweet it is to roam 
across the ocean, and see new towns and wondrous 
lands, and to come home laden with treasure, and to 
win undying fame.’ And the good ship Argo heard 
him, and longed to be away and out at sea; till she 
stirred in every timber, and heaved from stem to 
stern, and leapt up from the sand upon the rollers, 
and plunged onward like a gallant horse; and the 
heroes fed her path with pine trunks till she rushed 
into the whispering sea.” * 
4. The style in which the story is to be told is 
important More is said about this in the chapter 
on picture making, but some mention must also be 
made here. 
Definite types of stories need characteristic 
methods of presentation. Greek stories are wholly 
different from the Arabian Nights; the first need a 
clear, dignified, simple and direct style; the second 
should be dressed gorgeously in a revel of colours, 
with plenty of description in terms of splendour,

silver pillars, golden thrones, caverns ablaze with 
flashing gems, scarlet and purple hangings... . A 
legend could not possibly begin as one of the Kipling 
stories. . . . “Now, Best Beloved, when the world 
was very young and all” ... or a story from the 
Arthurian cycle told in the language of Brer Rabbit. 
The “Now it came to pass” ... and the “ Once 
upon a time”... belong to two quite different 
types of stories. Perhaps the ‘dry’ manner is most 
suitable for the Drolls, while the note of cunning 
and mischief must be kept throughout the Brer 
Rabbit adventures. ] 
A comparison between the two following passages 
will bring out this point, especially if they be read 
aloud.* 
“Thereupon the old crone took the shining caul- 
dron, wherefrom she set to wash his feet, and poured 
in much cold water, and next mingled therewith the 
warm. Now Odysseus sat aloof from the hearth, 
and of a sudden he turned his face to the darkness, 
and anon he had a misgiving of heart, lest when she 
handled him she might know the scar again, and all 
should be revealed. Now she drew her lord to wash 
him, and straightway she knew the scar of the 
wound, that the boar had dealt him with his white 
tusk long ago. . . . Now the old woman took the 
scarred limb, and passed her hands down it, and 
knew it by the touch, and let the foot drop suddenly, 
so that the knee fell into the bath, and the brazen 
vessel rang, being turned over on the other side, and

behold the water was spilled on the ground. Then 
joy and anguish came on her in one moment, and 
both her eyes filled up with tears, and the voice of 
her utterance was stayed, and touching the chin of 
Odysseus, she spake to him saying... ‘Yea, 
verily thou art Odysseus, my dear child, and I knew 
thee not before till I had handled all the body of my 
lord.’”* And this... 
“ Now when the time was getting over, she began 
to think about them skeins, an’ to wonder if he had 
’em in mind. But not one word did he say about 
em, and she wholly thought he had forgot em. But 
the last day o’ the month, he takes her to a room 
she’d never set eyes on afore. There worn’t nothing 
in it but a spinnin’ wheel an’ a stool. And, says 
he, ‘ Now me dear, here yow’ll be shut in to-morrow 
with some vittles an’ some flax, and if you hain’t 
spun five skeins by the night, your head ’Ilgo off.’ 
. . . Well she were that frightened, she’d allus been 
such a useless mawther, that she didn’t so much as 
know how to spin, and what were she to do to- 
morrow, wi’ no one to come nigh to help her. She 
sat down on a stool in the kitchen, and lawk ... 
how she did ery !”? 
5. The Approach. We may often practise a 
surprise full of delight upon our little hearers, by 
telling the same tale from a different point of 
view, starting it at a different stage. We are 
apparently giving another story, when, cutting across 
it, comes a faintly familiar figure or situation.

We may, for instance, picture a cottage kitchen 
where the old country woman with upturned 
sleeves is standing at the scrubbed table which 
is strewn with yellow basins and brown jars. She 
is busy making the weekly cake, a deep bowl is 
full of flour, flour lies thickly on her arms, a blue- 
rimmed basin close beside the pastry board holds 
the frothy beaten eggs. . . . She takes up the flat, 
worn, wooden spoon, and . . . in at the open window 
. . + but we are right in the middle of a story we 
have always known . . . we cannot remember the 
time when we did not know the Ugly Duckling ! ! ! 
It is wonderfully charming, not only to the listeners 
taken unaware, but to the teller—for the interest 
lies in watching for the first startled look, the first 
suspicion of recognition, and the dawning of a smile, 
before the complete enlightenment... “Oh, I 
know! Iknow!!”?* 
6. It is often helpful in preparation to work out a 
Tile Anolige so that the people and episodes stand 
out clearly and strike their individual note. A 
section of a story may then be taken out and worked 
over separately; and contrasts may be brought out 
more convincingly. The folk story, because of its 
simple structure, illustrates this method well, and 
the following is an analysis of the Black Bull of Nor- 
roway.”   
1In a similar way it gives a very real pleasure to find ourselves 
in the printer’s backyard in Arnold Bennett’s Hilda Lessways, and 
to recognise it as we knew it in Clayhanger. We may follow the 
fortunes of Peter Westcott in Mr. Walpole’s Fortitude, meeting him 
again in The Young Enchanted and The Green Mirror, but this is 
not quite the same thing, for we see succeeding, and not contempo- 
rary, events here.

Although this illustration serves for the general 
type of story, we may see in it the particular method 
of telling a folk tale which is a straightforward un- 
varnished recital of events, description being cut to 
the necessary minimum; the action is quick, almost 
monotonously so, except perhaps at the final and 
most critical repetition, where a rallentando or 
crescendo may be welcome to distinguish it from all 
its kindred. The style approximates to the ballad 
form, and to get oneself into it, it often helps to read 
a few ballads aloud, noticing their straightforward 
steady onward movement. 
7. And now we come to an apparent contradiction. 
The story should be told straightforwardly, yet the 
play of fancy must constantly run through it. This 
quality of the story teller is so important that several
-P-A-G-E-91
TECHNIQUE OF STORY TELLING 73 
pages must be given to it. It is the power of seeing 
life in everything, the gift of imagination that sees 
likeness in difference, which must light our story 
telling from beginning to end. 
In the telling of stories of a certain type we should 
set fancy free to play about the common things of 
life. In the Spring-time of the Race, man lived an 
out-of-door life, and his vitalising power overflowed 
to the natural objects around him. Gods and god- 
desses of sun and moon, spirits of river and cloud, 
were created for and by him. 
In the nursery, too, toys lead a double life. Are 
they not just toys by day and individuals by night ? 
How the notion transforms the stiff Noah in his 
ark, the woolly dolls with their beady, unwinking 
eyes! Think of that summer night— 
“A night so calm and sweet, 
When all the little boats woke up 
And made a little fleet.” 
We have Gluck’s mug with the twinkling, red- 
faced “King of the Golden River” beaming from 
between the handles; the wonderful face on Pan- 
dora’s box, sometimes smiling a welcome, sometimes 
bearing a malevolent grin, always insinuating and 
attracting. 
Robert Louis Stevenson, in his Inland Voyage, 
gives another delightful illustration. He comes to 
Compiégne and notices the Town Hall clock. There 
are three little mechanical figures, each with a 
hammer in his hand, and they chime out the halves 
and quarters of the hours. They are brave time- 
keepers for the burgesses of Compiégne, with their 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
  | 14 CHILDREN’S STORIES 
gilt freast-pletas, gilt trunk-hose, and fiapping hats - 
like cavaliers. ‘“ As the quarter approaches they turn 
their heads and look knowingly one to the other; and 
‘Kling !’ go the three hammers on three little bells 
below. The hour follows, deep and sonorous, .. . 
and the gilded gentlemen rest from their labours 
with contentment.” At night, even, when grown 
people are snoring under quilts, here are “ these gin- 
gerbread figures winking and twinkling to the stars 
and the rolling moon.” Stevenson leaves early next 
morning, at six o’clock ; the streets are empty save for 
people washing down steps. ‘“ Nobody was in full 
dress but the cavaliers upon the Town Hall; they 
were all washed with dew, spruce in their gilding, and 
full of intelligence and a sense of professional respon- 
sibility. ‘Kling !’ went they on the bells for half- 
past six as we went by. I took it kind of them to 
make me this parting compliment; they never were 
in better form, not even at noon upon a Sunday.” 
There was a little Dutch girl in whose life the 
statue of Erasmus, standing in one of the wider parts 
of a street in Rotterdam, played a very real part. 
She had been told by a teasing uncle that Erasmus 
would turn the page of his boook when he heard the 
clock strike twelve. Many a day did she hurry along 
the street on the stroke of the hour and gaze up at 
the grave, solitary figure, but he never moved. He 
was so great a scholar that he read on, undisturbed by 
the passing of canal boats, the traffic on the cobbles, 
the striking of the clocks and the bargaining of the 
market folk. If she had dared, she would have liked 
to stand on tiptoe and pull his gown just once, but by 
the time her courage was high enough the hour had
-P-A-G-E-93
  TECHNIQUE OF STORY TELLING 5 
struck, and it was with a feeling of relief that she 
hurried on, only to be fascinated again the next 
day. 
Hans Andersen is a master in the art of making 
common things live. Does not Keats share with the 
Danish story teller the same power? The old 
bedesman, creeping through the church on the bitter 
night of St. Agnes’ Eve, sees the motionless “ Knights 
and ladies praying in dumb orat’ries—” 
“ And his weak spirit fails 
To think how they may ache in icy hoods and mails.” 
This capacity for entering into the life of man and 
things is a characteristic of Keats. His sweet peas 
“stand a-tiptoe for a flight.” He writes: “If a 
sparrow come before my window I take part in its 
existence and pick about the ground.” 
There is Elia writing of himself as a little boy on 
holiday, visiting his Grandmother Field, wandering 
in the old garden, “ basking in the orangery till I 
could almost fancy myself ripening too, along with 
the oranges and limes, in that grateful warmth ”; 
or, indoors, “where I... used to spend many 
hours by myself, gazing upon the old busts of the 
Cesars, that had been Emperors of Rome, till the 
old marble heads would seem to live again, or I be 
turned to marble with them.” 
This dainty, glowing, human-ness, shot through 
with fancy; this imaginative quality, we might well 
set free to play about the home-life and stories of the 
child. 
And fancy will readily extend to objects having no 
outward semblance of human life, as we see in the

fluttering sweet peas and the —_ oranges. Who 
has not heard the cheerful little sprite who lives 
inside the tram-conductor’s punch ? There is Mrs. 
Peerybingle’s kettle, who sang such a spirited duet 
with the cricket on the hearth, to pass the time before 
tea. There is the proud darning-needle, the false 
collar, and the old street lamp.’ Listen to the Old 
Bridge at Florence: 
“ And when I think that Michael Angelo 
Hath leaned on me, I glory in payee 
In Mr. H. Monro’s Solitude, there is a picture of 
the quiet room, all things tidied for ihe night, the fire 
dying low, yet a sense of expectant waiting pervading 
all; there is silence. Then— 
“A distant engine whistles, or the floor 
Creaks, or the wandering night wind bangs a door.” 
“ Silence is scattered like a broken glass, 
The minutes prick their ears and run about, 
Then one by one subside again, and pass 
Sedately in, monotonously out.” 
“The minutes prick their ears.” 
Many children have this imaginative power 
richly, but all are not so lucky as the child Hilda 
Conkling, whose mother wrote her lovely little 
“poems” down as the child chanted or sung them 
spontaneously. Pansies are of the velvet family, 
with the “thinking faces”; the fireflies are “ count- 
ing the leaves” as they dart from bush to bush; the 
snail wags his head like “a clown at a circus”...

the old bridge “ bends his back for us to go over.” * 
Some may doubt the wisdom of allowing and en- 
couraging this play of fancy. ‘ What is the good of 
imagination ?” In The Truants, by Mason, this 
little dialogue occurs: “ You will understand now.” 
“Why now ?” “Because recently, imagination has 
come to you. Imagination—the gift to see clearly, 
the power to understand, perhaps the greatest gift 
love has in all his box of gifts.” Dreaming John is 
king of the earth as he lies among the scented clover 
and receives his company “shod in gold.” ? 
The question for common-sense is always “ What 
is it good for 2?” A question which would “ abolish 
the rose and be answered triumphantly by the cab- 
bage,” Lowell reminds us. 
Let us keep and cherish the rose in our story 
telling. 
8. It is imagination, too, that will help us to solve 
a question which concerns the story teller and his 
technique—that of allowing interruptions from the 
children which undoubtedly destroy the cumulative 
effect, break the spell and shift the centre of interest 
disastrously. We should distinguish between the 
various types of stories: The Tree Dwellers, Early 
Cave Men,* Robinson Crusoe, are carried on most 
effectively by question and answer, but the general 
.type of narrative stands as literature to the child; 
it should be a work of art, not to be destroyed by too 
much breaking into by means of questions. Happily, 
it is not possible to make rules about this, even for 
1 Poems by a Little Girl, Hilda Conkling.

  78 CHILDREN’S STORIES 
oneself; it does undoubtedly sometimes heighten the 
effect now and then to pause and ask for the solution 
of some problem. It is, for instance, interesting to 
have a little discussion in the Arcite and Palemon 
story,’ as to the three different temples, and which 
are likely to be used by the two lovers and Emily. 
Generally, however, questions come from the 
children because they do not understand, and a more 
careful preparation would probably lessen this type 
of interruption. It is sometimes desirable to ask a 
question to assure oneself that the children are clear 
as to some issue, especially if they have not been 
accustomed to listening to stories, ‘or if the plot is 
rather a complicated one; but these should be re- 
duced to a minimum. Where there is much descrip- 
tion it is sometimes a good plan to divide into sec- 
tions, and to have a little pause or breathing space 
between the scenes, where children may, if they wish, 
ask or comment on the story; and one may have a 
clear understanding that this is the opportunity to 
speak, and that all questions must wait until this 
time comes. 
In the desire to give the child freedom, we must 
not allow him to ignore courtesy; he should realise 
from the start that the story teller as well as the story 
listener has rights. If he joins the story circle he 
must listen to the end of the story before leaving; 
though on the other hand, for the story teller to 
insist on a formal attitude for the listening is surely 
a pity; many apparently inattentive children are 
really giving full heed to the narrative. It is a ques- 
tion of the reconciliation of the teller’s and lis- 
1One of the stories from ee

tener’s points of view, of the adult’s and the child’s 
point of view, and the gift of imagination can do 
more to bring about this reconciliation than any- 
thing else.* 
It may be interesting to apply some of the sugges- 
tions in this chapter to a particular story not written 
for children, and “ Pan and the Babe” (p. 126) has 
been included for this purpose. We often read some- 
thing which we feel we should like to tell again to 
children, and often it is helpful to ask ourselves 
questions about it; it may even be that in so doing 
we may find that it is not suitable after all. The 
following points might be considered in connection 
with “ Pan and the Babe.” 
1. Is an introduction needed? If so, what should 
be set out ? 
2. Can the story be told now without modifica- 
tions ? 
3. Would it make the narrative easier to follow 
to shift the scenes, and add others ?—for instance, 
to give first hand the pre-story scene of the shepherd 
with his sheep, and the calling of him away by his 
brethren. 
4, Are there any words which need explanation, 
and if so, in what way are they best explained, e.g. 
1The difference in the child’s and the adult’s attitude is easily 
seen if the story teller watches carefully the faces in a mixed audi- 
ence. If the folk story of ‘‘Cap o’ Rushes” is told to both chil- 
dren and grown up people, the children will always accept without 
a flicker of unbelief or amusement the fact that the Prince took his 
bed for love of the Princess, when he failed to find her, and that 
the cook made him gruel over the kitchen fire. But when this part 
of the tale is reached with adults, a look of incredulity or amuse- 
ment creeps over the listening faces; the facts are not accepted, 
though they are gravely told, and one can almost catch the re- 
monstrating thought, “Now you are trying me too far!”
-P-A-G-E-98
     
80 CHILDREN’S ee 
“Belwether” ? Will it affect the story if some of 
these words are left out ? 
5. How could the second paragraph, the descrip- 
tion of Pan’s mood, be made intelligible and real to 
young hearers ? 
6. Could the dialogue between Pan and the old 
sheep be expanded ? 
7. How can the dialogue between the shepherd 
and the Shepherd God be made clearer ? 
8. There is much unexpressed in the meeting of 
Pan and the Babe; it is really the heart of the story. 
Is it possible to bring this out, and give more to it, 
or not ? 
9. Do we feel after thinking over some of these 
points that the story is one for children ? Is it 
suitable for the little one in the kindergarten and 
nursery, the preparatory, or junior school ? 
But with all these questions the great preparation 
must never be lost sight of—the meditation of the 
story as a whole, with its significance; then, indeed, 
it sometimes happens that the places are changed, 
and instead of possessing the story, it possesses us. 
In so far as this happens the suggestions above be- 
come obvious and our story falls into shape as we 
alternately envisage it and the child hearer.

CHAPTER V 
PICTURE MAKING AND WORD CHOOSING 
There are two parts in this chapter: 
(1) The seeing of pictures in words. 
(2) The making of pictures through words. 
The necessary introduction both for the teller and listener 
is discussed, and the detection of the characteristic note; 
the need of contrast in picture making, the gradual building 
up of a picture, the collection of word pictures that are 
helpful; the study of literature, whereby we realise the 
descriptive quality of words; and finally the charac- 
teristics of the sounds and letters themselves; these are 
considered because they are the medium in which the story 
teller works. 
LTHOUGH both descriptions and style have al- 
ready been touched upon in the last chapter, they 
are of such vital consequence in the story telling, that 
a new chapter must be given to their consideration. 
Two things are necessary in order to make pictures 
with words... . 
1.—We must be able to visualize them for our- 
selves. 
2.—We must have such a mastery over words, that 
we can use them to enable others to see. 
We will take a simple illustration first, and then 
deal at some length with each of the above heads. 
81

  82 CHILDREN’S STORIES 
Ina little poem, “The Old Woman of the Roads,” * | 
we have first a still-life picture, and as we read it, 
there should be the definite effort to build up the 
picture of the cottage room . . . the hearth with its 
heaped-up sods, the stool and pile of turf before it, 
the dresser with its shining plates and cups of white 
and blue and brown, the clock on the opposite wall. 
Now the picture breaks into movement; the happy 
home wife sweeps the hearth and floor, washes the 
china, and busies herself, before she sits by the fire, 
or goes to her warm bed to rest. In the last two 
verses, the security and peace of the little cottage 
passes, for it is but a dream cottage, and we are now 
on the changing homeless road; the dreamer is an 
old tramp woman. Our two pictures are great con- 
trasts, the first full of clear fresh colour and light, the 
second misty, dirty and drab. 
Next we should try to make a picture in words of 
the old tramp herself, as she drags her aimless way, 
weary and alone, her broken boots and ragged shawl, 
her straggles of grey hair, her moving lips as she 
prays for a shelter... her eyes with the deep 
longing look, as she thinks of her little dream house 
. a house of her own, “ Out of the wind’s and the 
rain’s way.” 
We have here the two activities, acting and re- 
acting upon one another: 
(i.) The activity of the story teller or maker ; 
(ii.) The activity of the listener ; 
and in order to be good story tellers we should ac- 
custom ourselves to be good listeners too. 
We will now take the two activities more in detail.

PICTURE MAKING 83 
1.—In order to see pictures, and present them, our 
first concern is to detect the chief note or mood of 
the story; we must be aware of its colour or tone so 
that we may attune ourselves to it. It may be happy, 
sad, profound, trivial, and we must give ourselves 
time to absorb the right mood,* and for this it is often 
necessary to know something of the origin of the 
stories themselves. The stories of Odin, Thor and 
Balder belong to the grey North, with its dark forests 
and rocky coasts; they will, like them, be strong, 
rugged and bracing; they will be of storm and ice, 
giants, hammers and mighty exploits. 
The legends of the Holy Grail, on the other hand, 
will strike another note, belonging to another people 
whose ideals tended towards self-conquest, self-sacri- 
fice and adoration. They will shine with a spirit- 
ual glow not known in the ruder earlier times. 
In the heroic saga of Beowulf we should steep our- 
selves in the various interpretations of the story, 
perhaps taking Beowulf’s fight with Grendel as a 
nature myth—summer defeating winter, the Serpent 
of Darkness attacking and being defeated by the 
Powers of Light. At the same time, there are cer- 
tainly the strands of definite historical incidents, 
around which poets wove stories, throwing into focus 
certain composite figures such as Grendel and 
1 Sometimes music will help to develop the dominant note of the 
story. Grieg’s “The Death of Asa,” played before and after the 
telling of the death of Balder, brings out the tragedy almost unbear- 
ably. It is, of course, not necessary to present the same topic in 
each medium, the essential thing is to present the mood in order to 
heighten the general descriptive effect. Some of the music in “‘ Peer 
Gynt” is a delightful help taken in connection with Christina Ros- 
setti’s “Goblin Market,” where the gnomes dance down the river 
bed with their luscious fruits in the evening light. See p. 138.
-P-A-G-E-102
  84 CHILDREN’S STORIES 
Beowulf, and we should realise that it is prima facie 
a stirring story of our own island in very early days 
with the salt seas and winds in it. In the “ Ring of 
the Nibelung,” we should realise the burden . . . 
“Only when all the dross of sin is quit, 
Only when life dies like a white flame spent 
Death dies along with it.” 
It should be our concern to tell these stories straight- 
forwardly, selecting suitable incidents, yet seeking to 
detect the notes sounding through the sagas, with 
their hint of more than sense matters.’ 
Much of the symbolic meaning will be hidden from 
the children, yet when the meaning and truth strike 
home to ourselves, and penetrate to our own spirit, 
we convey not in words but in some intangible way, 
the wonder, pathos, inner life. The child’s warning, 
“T can understand if you do not explain so much,” 
should be taken to heart, and we should trust our 
wider knowledge to transmit itself through the spirit 
of the telling rather than give the academic explana- 
tion which we have read for our own preparation, for 
this should rarely be given. 
Apart from this wider interpretation, which helps 
the teller to detect the note of the story, older chil- 
dren obviously sometimes need an introduction, in 
order to set the story in time and place, and it is the 
problem of the story teller to decide when to give the 
jewel in its setting and when to refrain.” 
1A study of the fairy chart (p, 38) should help us to detect the 
note and set the story in the life of the Race. 
2Even for older people a little introduction or explanation is 
sometimes desirable. The prologue before each act in ‘“ Abraham 
Lincoln” by John Drinkwater helps to set the note so that we are 
prepared to receive the message as it comes. It serves as a thread 
 
-P-A-G-E-103
  PICTURE MAKING 85 
It is possible to give a little of the setting of the 
Saga as sung in the Halls of the Folk. One can draw 
a simple word picture . . . the warriors, seamen, 
merchants filling the benches round the hall, the 
chief sitting high on the top seat, the fierce, red flare 
of the leaping fire in the midst, the cup going round. 
The men are at ease, and the harper now strikes 
his harp, and begins to sing of the great fights of 
the past to the warriors who have themselves fought 
with glee and valour. He sings of immortal deeds 
to these men of courage who themselves “ never left 
a shield.” In the stories of the Canterbury Pilgrims 
we need to describe the gay cavalcade as it rode 
through Surrey and Kent. 
But, with all this, it surely is imperative that the 
story be started and told as soon as possible, for it is 
of action that the children want to hear, and the 
academic interest comes later. Yet the story teller 
himself must have it as a rich background to be 
drawn upon at will, and the picture will be more 
upon which to string the incidents of a life. The method needs to be 
used sparingly, perhaps, because we can only take in that for which 
we are ready and we always “put on the cap when it fits.” G. K. 
Chesterton’s play, ‘“‘ Magic,” might possibly gain by a foreword 
with a hint of the teaching, though on the other hand it is much 
better for people to think it out for themselves, and if they do, 
being subjective, there will be many interpretations. In taking 
“The Princess” with girls, it will probably be clearer to have 
a little preliminary talk, largely contributed by the girls themselves, 
about the differences between the outlook and practice of women 
to-day and that of a hundred years ago; this will bring them right 
up to the theme of the story, and they will bring a more alert mind 
to the situations presented. In reading the ballad of “ Little Hugh 
of Lincoln,” one must briefly speak of the intolerance of one sect 
to another, and the relations of Jews to Christians of that time, 
to make the ballad intelligible to the hearers. In taking ‘ Patient 
Griselda” with older children one needs to remind them of the 
position of women in the medieval times.
-P-A-G-E-104
86 CHILDREN’S STORIES 
vivid for that knowledge.* We must learn to see 
our word-pictures vividly, and use colour to help 
us. 
Two such pictures are needed as an introduction 
to the story of “ The Knife and the Naked Chalk,” ? 
when we edit and adapt it for telling. 
The first picture is green, blue, and white. 
The Downs, with their smooth, short grass, green 
and soft, reaching away to the blue sky beyond on 
the one hand and to the blue sea on the other .. . 
Blue sky stretches wide above with little white clouds 
floating within it. They make moving shadows of 
dark grey, purple, black, and blue, as they drift over 
the bright green of the Downs . . . Here and there 
the earth is broken and the gleaming white chalk 
throws up its whiteness to match the clouds... . 
On the blue sea ride white crests, carrying on the 
gleam ... Here and there on the green Downs 
wander flocks of sheep, woolly and white. Green 
pasture . . . white sheep ... blue sky. Sky... 
sun... airand space. This is the Shepherd Flint- 
worker’s home. 
The contrast in the second picture lies in the dark, 
dense woods growing at the foot of the Downs, 
stretching far inland. Black and red are the domi- 
nant notes here. Darkness and danger lurk among 
the giant trees, whose deep shade keeps sun and air 
away. MRayless, hot and heavy, black as night the 
picture grows, but for the glowing fires that the Chil- 
dren of the Night have made . . . Great glowing 
fires gleam red and orange through the gloom,

making the men’s figures huge and black, like giants 
casting weird shadows as they move. 
We might weave our word picture into a more 
definite introduction to the story. Here is the same 
thing done in a rather different way: 
The People of the Chalk.—In some parts of Eng- 
land there are wide open stretches of country, great 
rolling downs, gentle slopes of short green grass. 
Where the land is cracked and yawns in big spaces, 
the white chalk gleams out. Lying on the short, 
green grass, one finds flint stones among the softer 
chalk boulders here and there. There is no shelter. 
The wide breezy downs are dangerous for man and 
sheep, yet the grass is very good. The flint-worker 
lives here, making stone runies and caring for his 
sheep. 
Far below, dark belts of trees stand up against the 
sky; thick dark copses nestle down below the huge 
shoulders of the chalk. The Magic Men of the Night 
live here. 
They have learnt to find iron in the earth, they 
have built fires from the brittle wood about them, 
and have melted the earth’s stones, and made them- 
selves iron runies, sharp and cruel. But the Wolf 
. . . Grey Shepherd . . . Feet in the Night . . . is 
a terror to them both; he stole the sheep and, grow- 
ing bold, fell upon children and women of the tribes. 
The flint-workers can only throw their stone 
spears, but the iron-blade workers can cut clean 
thrusts at the wolves. Gradually many men, through 
many years, each working in his own country, found 
out the secrets of overcoming the beast. This story 
shows how the flint-worker on the naked downs did

so... Picture him as he tells his own tale... . 
A man half-naked, with a sheep-skin cloak girt on 
his waist, leaving his shoulders bare, his arms all 
scarred with horrible white marks where the beast 
had bitten him. The right eye is gone and the eyelid 
shrunk upon the place. And now he begins to tell 
how, for the sake of the people, he lost the sight of 
his eye. He is Tyr, Buyer of the Blade, and he slips 
a long, dark, iron knife, almost a short sword, from 
his belt to show us as we listen. 
Just as in the Folk Stories we found that there 
were great contrasts in scenes and episodes, so in 
our own construction of stories we must arrange for 
this, throwing the scenes as far as possible into con- 
trasting relationship. We have it in the foregoing 
story of the “Knife and the Naked Chalk,” and 
Chaucer, in the introduction to “ The Knight’s Tale,” 
has another couple of such contrasting pictures. In 
the latter we see, first, the sunlit garden flowers and 
“branches green,” and the beauteous Emily—it is 
like a little water-colour sketch, full of light and 
delicacy; and secondly, the two miserable prisoners, 
cooped within their strong dark tower, with only 
a window “ thick with many a bar,” through which 
to catch the beauty of the summer world outside—this 
is a picture done roughly in black crayon on a cold 
ground. 
There is, too, the detailed picture of Emily. 
“Emily more beauteous to be seen 
Than is the lily on his stalk of green, 
And fresher than the May with flowers new 
For with the rose’s colour strove her hue, 
I know not which was fairer of the two. 
 
-P-A-G-E-107
  
PICTURE MAKING 89 
. . . Attired she was all fresh and carefully, 
Her yellow hair was braided in a tress 
Behind her back, a full yard long, I guess, 
And in the garden as the sun uprose 
She wandered up and down where as she chose, 
She gathereth flowers partly white and red, 
To make a cunning garland for her head, 
And like an angel’s singing rose her song.” 
And with this picture of Emily we may place in 
contrast of a much subtler kind the simple character 
sketch of Griselda from the “Clerke’s Tale,” not 
now showing the outer girl in colour at all, yet mak- 
ing us feel we really know her much the more inti- 
mately of the two. 
“ Among the poorer folk there dwelt a man, 
And he was held the poorest of them all... 
A daughter had he, fair and without blame, 
Griselda was the fair young maiden’s name. 
But if all maidenly virtues beauteous be, 
Then was the maid the fairest under the sun, 
So humbly nurtured in her home was she, 
No greedy wants seemed in her thoughts to run, 
. - . She knew what work was—never idle ease, 
But though this maiden was as yet so young, 
Under her girlish innocence there lay, 
A brave and serious spirit, ever strong. 
And with good heart she laboured day by day, 
To tend and help her father poor and grey. 
Some sheep while spinning in the field she kept, 
For never was she idle till she slept . . . 
Hard was her bed and frugal was her fare, 
Keeping her father with untiring care, 
And all obedience, and all diligence 
That child can give to filial reverence.” 
We may sometimes construct a figure, piece by
-P-A-G-E-108
  90 CHILDREN’S STORIES 
piece, adding item upon item, line upon line, as it 
were, rather as if parts of a puzzle were being slowly 
fitted together in a very definite and logical order. 
Here are two pictures of this kind, In the first the 
great goddess Kwannon grows gradually out of the 
darkness.* “ The old priest lights a lantern and leads 
the way through a low doorway, on the left of the 
altar, into the interior of the temple, into some very 
lofty darkness. I follow him cautiously awhile, 
discerning nothing whatever but the flicker of 
the lantern, then we halt before something that 
gleams. A moment, and my eyes become more 
accustomed to the darkness, begin to distinguish 
outlines; the gleaming object defines itself gradu- 
ally as a foot, an immense golden foot, and I per- 
ceive the hem of a golden robe undulating over the 
instep. Now the other foot appears; the figure is 
certainly standing. I can perceive that we are in a 
narrow, but also very lofty, chamber, and that out 
of some mysterious blackness overhead ropes are 
dangling down into the circle of lantern light illu- 
minating the golden feet. The priest lights two more 
lanterns, and suspends them upon hooks attached to 
a pair of pendent ropes about a yard apart; then he 
pulls up both together slowly. More of the golden 
robe is revealed as the lanterns ascend, swinging on 
their way; then the outlines of two mighty knees; 
then the curving of columnar thighs under chiselled 
drapery, and, as with the still waving ascent of the 
lanterns the golden vision towers ever higher through 
the gloom, expectation intensifies . . . Now above 
the golden girdle the suggestion of a bosom. Then

the glowing of a golden hand uplifted in benediction. 
Then another golden hand holding a lotus, and, at 
last, a face, golden, smiling with eternal youth and 
infinite tenderness, the face of Kwannon ... But 
the lanterns ascend still higher, . .. and lo! the 
tiara of the divinity appears, with strangest sym- 
bolism. It is a pyramid of heads, of faces,—charm- 
ing faces of maidens, miniature faces of Kwannon 
herself. For this is the Kwannon of the Eleven 
Faces.” 
The folk story of the old woman who sat spin- 
ning alone in her cottage, and sighed for company, 
is a favourite, for the construction is deliberate, add- 
ing bit to bit till the whole figure is seen. ‘“ In came 
a pair of broad, broad soles, and sat down on the 
hearth, but still she sighed for company ... And 
in came a pair of thin, thin legs and sat down on the 
pair of broad, broad soles . . . and still she sighed 
for company.” Then in came a pair of thick, thick 
thighs and sat down on the thin, thin legs . . . then 
came in a small waist, and then chest and arms and 
neck and head, till at last the figure is complete. 
Between each addition comes the refrain, “ And still 
she sighed for company.” It is cumulative in effect 
until we see the grotesque unwieldy creature sitting 
before us on the cottage hearth. 
We should look for word pictures everywhere. 
How clearly we see the great kitchen behind the tap- 
room of the “Bending Mule,” with young Peter 
Westcott swinging his legs from one of the tall old 
chairs, as he listens in the firelight to old Frosted 
Moses. The Memoirs of a Midget? are as full of

pictures as if the book were interleaved with draw- 
ings, and so is Peacock Pie;* the word pictures in 
Walter de la Mare’s books are like brocade worked 
in gleaming silver thread, or like fairy soap bubbles 
floating in summer sunshine. There are little cameo 
portraits in The Listeners;* Old Susan, the book 
lover, reading with her roughened thumb under the 
corner of the page all ready to turn over, and Miss 
Loo in her parlour. In Neighbours,’ Betty Riddle 
sits behind her stall, and Jaunty Jack climbs among 
his chimney pots. 
Story tellers should keep a word picture book. 
Here is a leaf from my collection. A faint water 
colour picture: 
“Through the ample open door of the peaceful country 
barn, 
A sunlit pasture field with cattle and horses feeding, 
And haze and vista, and the far horizon fading away.” * 
Here is a brighter one: 
“ All my clear eyed fish, 
Golden or rainbow sided, or purplish, 
Vermilion-tailed, or finned with silvery gauze.” 4 
And here is a wonderful prose picture from Conrad’s 
Youth: 
“And then I saw the men of the Hast—they were 
looking at me. The whole length of the jetty was full of 
people. I saw brown, bronze, yellow faces, the black 
eyes, the glitter, the colour of an Eastern crowd. And all 
these beings stared without a murmur, without a sigh,

without a movement, They stared down at the boats, 
at the sleeping men who at night had come to them from 
the sea. Nothing moved. The fronds of palms stood 
still against the sky. Not a branch stirred along the 
shore, and the brown roofs of hidden houses peeped 
through the green foliage, through the big leaves that 
hung shining and still, like leaves forged of heavy metal. 
This was the East of the ancient navigators, so old, so 
mysterious, resplendent and sombre, living and un- 
changed, full of danger and promise. And these were 
the men. I sat up suddenly. A wave of movement 
passed through the crowd from end to end, passed along 
the heads, swayed the bodies, ran along the jetty like a 
ripple on the water, like a breath of wind on a field—and 
all was still again. I see it now—the wide sweep of the 
bay, the glittering sands, the wealth of green infinite and 
varied, the sea blue like the sea of a dream, the crowd of 
attentive faces, the blaze of vivid colour—the water 
reflecting it all, the curve of the shore, the jetty, the high- 
sterned outlandish craft floating still, and the three boats 
with the tired men from the West sleeping, unconscious 
of the land and the people and of the violence of sun- 
shine. They slept thrown across the thwarts, curled on 
bottom-boards, in the careless attitudes of death, The 
head of the old skipper, leaning back in the stern of the 
long-boat, had fallen on his breast, and he looked as 
though he would never awake. Farther out old Mahon’s 
face was upturned to the sky, with the long white beard 
spread out on his breast, as though he had been shot 
where he sat at the tiller; and a man, all in a heap in the 
bows of the boat, slept with both arms embracing the 
stem-head and with his cheek laid on the gunwale. 
The East looked at them without a sound.” 
There is another vivid picture of the burning ship 
in mid-ocean, in the same story. 
Not only should we make pictures in terms of 
   
-P-A-G-E-112
94 CHILDREN’S STORIES 
sight, but sometimes we should imagine the sounds 
and scents, the touch and taste. 
“Tt pricked like needles slashed into his face, 
The unceasing rustling smother of dry snow 
That stormed the ridge... .” 
How many pictures can we make of rain in sum- 
mer ? 
See the grey slanting lines, now growing upright as 
the fall grows heavier ; hear it hissing through the air, 
and the soft “suck, suck” of the hungry earth 
as it feeds her greedy clutch; feel the gentleness of 
the first few drops, cool and wet, and the insistent 
“tap, tap, tapping ” on the bare face and hands, as 
it grows in intensity, till its stinging onset forces 
you to shelter under the friendly hedge. Smell it, 
with the scent of dust entwined in its faint fragrance, 
and as the rain settles into heaviness, sniff the clover 
and the trees in the wetness. Watch as light begins 
to play again through the wavering lines ; listen to the 
rhythm of the “ Drum, drum” as it slackens; and 
now the rising wind breaks up the dignity of the 
heavy rain, and sports gaily with the broken curves; 
the soft spatter dies away, and is lost in a mother-of- 
pearl, a re-created world. 
Though we have been concerned with the making 
and seeing of word pictures we should not ignore the 
introduction of illustrations made with brush and 
pencil. It is wise, however, to distinguish between 
those pictures that contain only the elements 
already in the mind, and those which really extend 
the vision. To show a picture of something the child 
already knows quite well is merely to multiply with-
-P-A-G-E-113
  PICTURE MAKING 95 
out enlarging, and, indeed, often gets in the way of 
the picture already constructed in the listener’s 
mind. ,We have all had the unpleasant shock of meet- 
ing a picture falling far below the one we have 
created for ourselves. 
On the other hand, pictures may and should do 
much to enrich the word pictures we are making 
constantly in the story telling time. It is a good 
plan to give a whole series to be looked at during 
leisure time, some days before the story is to be told. 
The children have now a background and a rich set- 
ting into which to place their characters and the 
events as they appear. For instance, a number of 
pictures of Dutch interiors will make more vivid a 
story dealing with Dutch life, though there may not 
be one among them depicting any part of the story 
itself; this work is for the listener to do, he must 
select from his store and build for himself. A series 
of bold, bright postcards of Indian life provides a 
much better type of illustration to the Hiawatha 
stories, than any single picture depicting a special 
scene. Before the Christmas stories are told it is 
well to show a number of Nativity pictures first, and 
then to tell the stories about them. In this way we 
are enlarging the experience; giving rich material 
with which to build, we are encouraging the child to 
do so for himself, which is the essential thing. 
This is the whole problem always: How much 
should we do for the child, how much should he do 
for himself? 
At any rate, we must see that he has a rich and 
joyous world full of beauty to live in, in the inner 
life of the spirit no less than in the outer world of

sense; and then we must have the grace to leave him 
alone with his treasures, so that he may verily possess 
them. Mr. W. H. Davies reminds us that even our 
most beautiful world falls below that of the child. 
“T saw this day sweet flowers grow thick ... 
But not one like the child did pick. ... * * * * * 
A hundred butterflies saw I 
But not one like the child saw fly. * * * * * 
My world this day has lovely been 
But not like what the child has seen.” 
2.—We now come to the consideration of the 
words themselves, for the story teller has not only 
to consider what story to tell, the note he hears in it, 
the pictures he sees in it, but he must also choose 
among words the ones most suitable for his purpose. 
We have seen that pictures may be made by words 
as clearly and vividly as by the brush, and it is a 
great help in our own attempts in the preparation of 
story telling, not only to read over other people’s, 
but to consider a little upon that art which can turn 
even a list of names into living beauty. Rupert 
Brooke’s “The Great Lover” and Masefield’s 
“ Cargoes ” might well be read over many times with 
this in mind. Here we have lists of words, but they 
are all full of the beauty of sound; alter the order 
and the beauty has gone. It is a wise plan to give 
ourselves much preliminary exercise of the kind, 
then when we come to the telling of the story, the 
characteristic words which have been noticed should 
be utilised; for instance, in the tale of “ Patient 
Griselda,” “ Say by thy pleasure, and I will obey” ;
-P-A-G-E-115

in the “ Odyssey,” “By the help of the gods and 
Pallas Athene the warrior returns home.” No set 
of stories from The Saga of Beowulf would be com- 
plete without some mention of the “ Wyrd,” the 
Goddess of Fate, “who ruled the doctrines of men, 
who tended to become in men’s minds supreme even 
over the highest gods.” Beowulf’s saying, “ Wyrd 
often delivers an earl yet undoomed, if his daring 
avail,” translated into our present-day proverb is 
“God helps them that help themselves,” but it must 
be said in the characteristic words. In the last fatal 
encounter, “it shall be as Wyrd wills; Wyrd, the 
measurer of each man’s life.” “ Wyrd carried away 
all my kinsmen at the fated time,” he says mourn- 
fully, in his lonely middle age. We must in our 
preparation carefully go over the story again and 
again, choosing characteristic words which in them- 
selves will give just that “tang” to the individual 
story which makes it stand out from all others, and 
a study of descriptive passages from poets and other 
good writers will develop our power in this direc- 
tion. Mr. Lamborn in his stimulating little book, 
The Rudiments of Criticism, reminds us of Tenny- 
son’s use of the word “wrinkled” in connection 
with the sea. “A poet stands on a high cliff and 
looks down at the sea below, it moves, it murmurs, 
it heaves, it ebbs and flows, it shimmers, it glitters, it 
has waves and troughs made tiny by the immense 
height; what among all this are its typical traits, 
and in what words is the perfect expression of them? 
Tennyson answers with two words, ‘The wrinkled 
sea beneath him crawls.’”” Masefield uses the same 
picture in “ Enslaved” ;

“JT paused upon the heath 
To watch beyond the tree top, the wrinkled sea beneath.” 
In the story of “ Little Peterkin,” * words illumine 
the whole forest and give meaning to all that the 
children see there. The three children set off to 
look for their little brother Peterkin, for they fear 
he will be lonely by himself ... beyond Death. 
They find themselves in a deep forest, the ground 
suddenly begins to swell, a strange jungle arises 
about them and the great branches touch the rose red 
sky far away. Huge crimson figures and green 
monstrosities and dragons flit by, and the children 
see that they are rushing to a house “ Woven of 
mysterious boughs” which has caught fire. Then 
amid the rush and terror they hear the old familiar 
rhyme long loved in their nursery days and garden 
plays... 
“Lady bird, Lady bird, fly away home 
Your house is on fire, your children are gone.” 
The forest of wild thyme waves high above the 
children’s heads. . . 
“We had been dwarfed as with magic words— 
The dragons were but lady birds.” 
The humming chant had made this clear to the 
“Little Seekers of the Dead.” 
There is a suggestive Japanese story which shows 
in a fantastic way the living quality of words.

his wonderful writing; his brush characters were

a man mocked at a letter he had painted on the gate 
of the Emperor’s Palace at Kyoto, saying: “ Why, 
it looks like a swaggering wrestler !”” But the same 
night he dreamed that a wrestler came to him and 
beat him grievously as he lay. He awoke with the 
crying and the pain and saw the wrestler rise in the 
air and change into the written letter he had laughed 
at and go back to the tablet over the gate ! 
The mysterious words which appeared on the 
wall of Belshazzar’s banqueting hall seemed to 
one little child to have some magic life, partly by 
their mode of appearing, but also because of the 
large type in which they were printed in the Bible. 
One poet, so conscious of the life in words, reverses 
the image, and instead of making ws choose words, 
imagines the words choosing us. . . . 
“Out of us all 
That make rhymes 
Will you choose sometimes . . . 
As the winds use 
A crack in the wall 
Or a drain, 
Their joy or their pain 
To whistle through ... 
Choose me, 
You English words,” + 
It is certainly one of the greatest joys of the story 
teller to be chosen, as it were, by them, to kindle and 
to charm; words seem indeed to crowd, and troop 
into the mind already tuned to their coming. 
Children, as we know, are very sensitive to the sounds 
of words, and they are happy, too, in playing the

“pretty sentence” game as Miss Drummond calls 
the making of rhythmic sentences with her little 
niece; at six years old she gave “Green grow the 
needles on the tall Scotch fir” and “The larches 
grow so tall and straight, they hold themselves so 
straight and tall.” * 
We know how easily metaphor is used, and with 
what charm; we may well play this game with our 
little story hearers, to our own edification. A water- 
fall is a tumble-storm, and some one “ breaks into 
clouds of laughter” ; the “egg comes caterpillaring 
out ” ? as the spoon goes in; and what could be more 
beautiful than the child’s description of a bright early 
morning as “shiny as gold; and everywhere on the 
grass just a little foggier than silver.” * We should 
find it very difficult to use words more exquisitely - 
than that ! . 
The sounds of the letters themselves are also 
characteristic and we might do much during our 
preparation in the deliberate recognition of these; 
we are then not only considering the dress or fabric 
in which to clothe our story, we are actually making 
the heart to beat in its body, for the sounds them- 
selves, pulsing through, create the life, bringing col- 
our and warmth and beauty. 
It is not enough to say “ Thus and thus it hap- 
pened.” . . . We must choose the right sounds to 
say it with, and this may perhaps not always be done 
consciously, for as the Philosopher reminded Mac- 
Cul,’ “TI have learned . . . that the head does not 
hear anything until the heart has listened, and that 
what the heart knows to-day the head will understand

to-morrow ”; and so it comes about that trusting to the 
springs of feeling, the right sounds . . . words... 
crowd to us if we do but train ourselves to recognise 
them when they come. 
Part of this delightful training may well lie in 
reading much verse and noticing how sound and 
sense are often a sweet unity. In the Candle of 
Vision, “ A. E.” has a couple of enthralling chapters 
on the living individual beauty of the several sounds; 
the motion and vitality of the trilled R, the finality 
of the baulked M, are two among the many. 
In The Rudiments of Criticism, Mr. Lamborn gives 
us many examples in the chapter “ Sound and Sense,” 
and in other parts of his suggestive book. Among the 
poets, Walter de la Mare in “ The Galliass ”* gives 
a song of sleep full of soft sounds, sh, sl, and the 1, 
which we recognise in the sleep-inducing word 
lullaby ... 
“Tell me, tell me, 
Unknown stranger, 
When shall I sight me 
That tall ship 
On whose flower-wreath counter is gilded 
Sleep?” 
And in Edward Thomas’s “ Lights Out,” we notice 
the effect of certain sounds making for quietness. . . . 
“T have come to the borders of sleep” . . . 
“The tall forest towers 
Its cloudy foliage lowers 
Ahead, shelf above shelf; 
Its silence I hear and obey 
That I may lose my way 
And myself.”

  102 CHILDREN’S STORIES 
There is the fact that words loaded with con- 
sonants, especially if the burden is at either end of 
the word, tend to slow down speech, and take a longer 
time to sound clearly. A little experiment will soon 
demonstrate this and many other ways in which 
sound gives its own quality to the sense content. 
There is a poem by James Stephens which is full of 
the frolic of sounds which themselves represent the 
little bird’s quick darting movements in nesting 
time... 
“T flit and twit, 
In the sun for a bit... 
And sit and fit 
My plumes .. . 
The nest is made, the hurry-scurry, the building 
business is over, the quieter time now comes when 
the mother-bird sits on her eggs... 
“ And she with glee 
Shows unto me... 
An egg, egg, egg.” 
And then the longer sustained flight of the happy 
parent has to be told... 
“T stoop and swoop 
On the air, or loop 
Through the trees . . .” 
And then finally a riot of all the sounds chiming 
together, like a singing rainbow, to show the many 
happinesses of the little bird . . . 
“T skim and swim 
By a cloud’s red rim 
And up to the azure flooring O, 
And my wide wings drip 
As I slip, slip, slip, 
Down through the raindrops, 2”

Back where Peg 
Broods in the nest 
On the little white egg 
So early in the morning 0.” 
A little study of the sounds will bring the changes out. 
We may sometimes ask ourselves as we become 
aware of a quickening in the scene, a slowing down, 
or a sudden movement in a peaceful quietude: Have 
we only become aware of it through the sense of the 
words we have just read, or is there something more 
subtle telling us the same story, inducing in us, the 
readers or listeners, the mood akin to the change of 
theme ? 
It is sometimes necessary to edit a story or poem, 
as we have seen, choosing certain passages and join- 
ing them together with a thread of narrative in 
our own words; this thread must be as beautifully 
and carefully woven into the body of the recital as 
we can make it, so that the story is as far as possible 
aunity. We may, by reading widely, with our hearts 
and ears alert, begin to recognise the helpers of our 
eraft . . . words, many-coloured words; we may run 
to meet them joyfully, as they crowd upon our need ; 
we may use them confidently, realising their natures, 
“T know you; 
You are light as dreams, 
Tough as oak, 
Precious as gold, 
As poppies and corn, 
Or an old cloak.”? 
The conviction steadily grows that “There are 
truly special words of witchcraft” and that they 
“bind and loose material things.”

CHAPTER VI 
VERSES, PLAYS AND MIME 
In this chapter some ways are given in which stories 
may be played through mime, and scenes written and 
acted from the tales already known; some possibilities 
of story making through the reading of verse to children, a 
kindred delight to that of story telling, are also suggested. 
LTHOUGH we have the story hour round the 
nursery or drawing-room fire in the early eve- 
ning, or in the school-room on the favourite day of 
the week (because of it !), we know, as story tellers, 
that the hour sometimes finds us doing other things 
more or less akin to story telling. Sometimes it is 
reading verse, and sometimes we do not feel ready 
to sit and listen to anything, and then we play 
charades, mime, and make and act plays. Here we 
return to the story already known and translate it 
into vigorous action. This last chapter gives some 
personal accounts of these things.’ 
A great deal of pleasure, not only for the moment 
but for the future, comes from the habit of listening 
to verse read aloud well. Of course there is no obliga- 
11It is surely a mistake to use one path only as the story teller 
wanders through the fields of literature; he makes difficulties for 
himself when he considers story telling as a self-contained activity, 
whether it be at home or at school; he must be ready to take his 
little flock in many pastures. 104

tion to learn any of the poems, though the favourites 
are asked for so often that they are soon known as 
lovingly by the children as the reader. Sometimes a 
suitable new book of verse may be taken, as This 
Singing World, or Come Hither,’ or Fairies and 
Chimneys,> and we read here and there, tasting, en- 
joying, turning the leaves, and going back to the 
verses we liked best. Sometimes old favourites are 
asked for, and we are happy enough reading from 
the growing heap on our laps, as they are taken from 
the loosening bookshelves. The Child’s Garden of 
Verses,* E. V. Lucas’ Book of Verses for Children, 
and Peacock Pie,’ are opened all ready to claim next 
place when the Jumblies’*® adventures are brought 
to a close. 
It is an enjoyable practice to take a little cycle of 
verse sometimes, round about a subject, as a centre 
of interest. For instance—

“Sailing at Dawn” . . . Sir Henry Newbolt 
“ Cargoes ” 4 . . . . John Masefield 
This group is, perhaps, for older children than the 
first set. It is ideal to have a family party at such 
readings, because it is good for the Littlest One to 
hear more than his nursery rhymes, and his eldest 
sister can, without shame, still listen with joy to the 
jingle of sound she used to love “so long ago ”— 
perhaps as much as a couple of years—when she was 
small ! A good deal more might be done in this 
way, where children of different ages come together 
sometimes to be read to, but the literature must be 
taken very skilfully, and each child must have his 
special favourites given. 
There is always the delight in rhythm and rhyme, 
as we saw in the telling of stories, and the joy in the 
swing and jingle of the nursery rhyme develops 
perhaps into the delight in the beauty of words and 
music that helps to lift verse into poetry. “Ba Ba 
Black Sheep,” and “ Cross Patch,” “ The Cupboard,” 
with its refrain “ For me, me, me,” “ Some One,” * 
and “The King of China’s Daughter,” * are great 
favourites; each of them is a little cameo story in 
itself which can be expanded, and the rhythm is 
haunting in all. 
The story and verse with a refrain soon grows a

one Winter Night,” the last line of each verse in 
“Star Talk,” ? which is doubled— 
“But rest is hopeless to-night, 
But rest is hopeless to-night.” 
are illustrations from widely different types. 
Later comes the longer poem of narrative with 
descriptive passages. “Echo and the Ferry” ®* is 
loved by children for its sweet, haunting music no 
. less than for its story. 
“Some one else, 
Oh, so softly—with laughter comes after, 
Comes after—with laughter comes after.” 
and the faint echo— 
“ Hie over! Hie over! You man of the ferry—the ferry 
‘You man of the ferry— 
You man of—you man of—the ferry.” 
Play on the words themselves is a great joy,— 
“What are you doing Goblin, Goblin?” 
“ Cobblin’, Cobblin’.”

light for little Londoners, though their country 
cousins love the rhythm well enough of

There is “ King’s Cross,”—‘ What shall we do” 
with his angry Majesty in a rage ?—and the spring 
song heard in Piccadilly— 
“Pick a dilly 
Pick a daffy 
Pick a daffy-dilly.” 
The longer poems can sometimes be told partly as 
a prose story, with extracts from the poem read. 
Sometimes a poem gives us only a hint of the story, 
as in “ Up the Airy Mountain,” * and that leads us to 
make it up for ourselves. ‘“ Overheard in a Salt 
Marsh ” ? may be developed into a little play of two 
acts. 
Sometimes it is the nonsense verse that crowns the 
hour’s enjoyment. The Jumblies stand, perhaps, as 
representatives of this class; Mr. Belloc, Edward 
Lear and Lewis Carroll give us fun and laughter 
plenteously.

It is interesting to read Strewel-Peter to children of 
different ages, and notice when the tragic stories 
begin to lose their dreadful content. There is grad- 
ually a little suspicion that things are not as bad as 
they seem, the elder children begin to receive the 
stories with a shy smile and a twinkle, the moral 
poems of Jane and Ann Taylor are taken with a 
grain of the saving salt of humour, and are even 
quoted in times of domestic crisis. 
There are the verses telling of the home world, 
as “ My Little Shadow,” * “ Bedtime,” * “ Blue Cur- 
tains”* ... there are the nature poems, “ Little 
Brown Seed,” “ Daffy-down Dilly” .. . verses 
about animals, “The Queen Goslings,” * “ The Song 
of the Camp Animals,” * with its imitative rhythm, 
and though E. V. Lucas has collected many favourites 
in his Book of Verse for Children, there are as many 
left out, for our children have always had their 
Pipers and their music from Ariel’s happy songs 
until to-day. 
Many children delight in the monotone suitable to 
the reading of some verse. “ Nod the Shepherd ” ° is 
generally asked for in this voice, when once the style 
is familiar . . . “ Your voice sounds sleepy like the 
sleepy poetry,” they say.

sources and of greatly differing character should be 
offered to the child, who from his nursery days 
joyously responds to the beauty in the sounds of 
words. 
After reading verse children often delight in carry- 
ing on the subject in a rhythmic way. I read the 
little character sketches of Timothy, Elaine, and the 
common sense Jane, one verse of the three of which 
I must quote. 
“* Bunches of grapes,’ says Timothy; 
‘ Pomegranates pink,’ says Elaine; 
‘A junket of cream, and a cranberry tart, 
For me,’ says Jane.” * 
One boy chanted his own version straight on after 
hearing the three verses, showing how he had caught 
the suggestion, 
“©A pair of shoes,’ says Timothy ; 
‘Slippers for me,’ says Elaine ; 
‘A pair of boots that come clomping downstairs 
For me,’ says Jane.” 
And here are some made by other children, taken at 
random from the many sent in: 
“* A new Sunday suit, says Timothy, 
“A blue silk dress,” says Elaine; 
“A cotton print that never wants washing 
For me,’ says Jane.” 
“<A bowler hat, says Timothy, 
A straw, with blue ribbons for Elaine—

“© A peacock all coloured,’ says Timothy,

Here is another family ... 
“T sang a song to Rosamond Rose 
Only the wind in the twilight knows. 
I sang a song to Jeanette Jennie, 
She flung from her window a silver penny. 
I sang a song to Matilda May 
She took to her heels and ran away. 
I sang a song to Susannah Sue, 
She giggled the whole of the verses through,” + 
and some of the children went on— 
“T sang a song to Jonathan Tim 
He told me to sing a Sunday hymn. 
I sang a song to Jocelyn Joy 
She said I was doing it to annoy. 
I sang a song to my sister alone, 
She listened and sang me a song of her own. 
I sang a song by the fire to my mother, 
She kissed me and asked me to sing another. 
I sang a song to Elizabeth Joan, 
She told me severely to let her alone.

She frowned and told me to go away.

This kind of exercise is often helpful in our story 
telling, for we see how, by a few words descriptive 
of action, we can give a hint of the character of the

person we are presenting. We know that Matilda 
May was a rude child, and Susannah Sue at the 
“ difficult age ” of schooldom, that Marjorie May was 
a cross person, and Millicent Strain, despite her name, 
a tactful one ! 
Akin to the telling of and listening to stories, 
comes the delight of making plays and acting them. 
There are many ways of setting about this, and chil- 
dren themselves give the lead as to which method 
should be adopted; indeed it varies from period to 
period, and story to story, and the following pages 
show some of the methods. 
“The Little Fir Tree,”* for instance, was read 
with a view to making it into a Christmas play to be 
acted before another form. The first reading was 
given so that every one should know the story as a 
whole. The second reading was taken with a view 
to breaking the story into scenes conditioned by 
Place. This resulted in (1) the Forest; (2) the 
House: and this broke up naturally into the Forest 
in Summer, the Forest in Winter, the Forest in 
Autumn, and once more the Forest in Winter. The 
need for presenting the little fir tree in two stages 
of growth was seen at once. 
We made a preliminary list of the people and 
creatures we should expect to see moving through 
the story. The children then volunteered to take 
certain scenes and write them up, and generally it 
was found helpful to have a little picture-making in 
words before the unaided work was attempted. For 
example, for the forest in summer, several girls were 
asked to describe their mental picture of a wood, 
1Hans Andersen.

  VERSES, PLAYS AND MIME 113 
with the special trees, the rabbits, birds, ete. The 
suggestion was made that we might have the children 
we should want later on, in the earlier part of the 
play also, and so the scene grew in interest. 
The children brought their little sketches, and they 
were read aloud. The class discussion generally led 
to the adoption of the more effective parts and the 
rejection of the others, so that at the end of the 
period we had a scene made by the efforts of several 
children and woven by the class with the teacher’s 
help into a unity. Sometimes the whole class wished 
to write a song or fairy story, and sometimes certain 
children were asked by the rest to make one for the 
play. During the making of the play, the scenes 
were often read aloud, and played, so that modifica- 
tions continually took place; indeed the difficulty 
was to know when to accept the final as such, for 
interest and critical power grew. 
Christina Rossetti’s “ Goblin Market ” was made 
into a play at the children’s request, after hearing it 
read. They were interested in using the lines of the 
poem itself, and the play began to shape itself from 
the experimental reading aloud of the two girls’ parts 
helped by the Goblins’ chorus.* This was done 
straight away, without rehearsal, in front of the class 
by volunteers. The writing became the record in 
this case, whereas in the “Little Fir Tree” it was 
the initial effort, which was continually modified by 
the experimental acting. In both plays, however, 
acting and writing, discussion and criticism, con- 
stantly interacted upon each other. 
Miming is an interesting form of acting especially

when it is taken in connection with Eurhythmics, 
which helps so greatly to beautiful movement. To 
mime is to give by gesture the idea generally con- 
veyed by language; beckoning means “ Come here,” 
shaking the head means “ No,” ete. We use a great 
deal of mime in everyday life, perhaps more than we 
are generally aware of ; there are characteristic move- 
ments to express sorrow, amusement, terror, ex- 
pectation, etc. These movements are used in the 
game known as “Dumb Charades,” but mime 
should be lifted from this level and expanded, both 
in the idea implied and in the movement expressing 
  it; for instance, we should expect the rhythmic © 
movement of pointing to oneself, slowly, and in a 
dignified and significant way, joined to the move- ° 
ment expressive of sorrow (perhaps the hands over 
the face, and a general bowed and reserved demean- 
our, in contradistinction to the expansive attitude of 
joy), which means “TI am sorry...” or “I am 
very sad,” instead of the one word “Sorry” or | 
“Sad.” After little exercises of this kind, which are 
really played as a guessing game, we moved to the — 
playing of a story, and “ Cinderella ” was suggested. 
The need of definite gesture was not realised at all; 
the watches knew the story, and could easily trans- 
late the vaguest actions—the action seen was what 
they expected to see, the visit of the Fairy God- 
mother, ete. 
This was pointed out, and the children set to work 
to find characteristic gestures for definite actions. 
A problem like: “ How can we show that Cinderella 
was sitting in front of the fire ?” had to be met. She 
must do more than just sit on the floor; the gestures
-P-A-G-E-133
VERSES, PLAYS AND MIME 115 
of sweeping the hearth, poking the fire, etc., were 
at once quickly forthcoming. 
The question of how to represent the godmother’s 
warning was passed over in this first attempt, to be 
revived later, but the critical fact of the striking of 
12 o’clock, while Cinderella was at the Ball, was too 
important a part in the whole story to be left out. 
The miming of conversations was practically omitted 
for some weeks, and the girls seemed completely sat- 
isfied with this rather meagre outline. 
So long as only this bare skeleton of the story was 
represented, very little progress was made, and the 
experiment showed no great possibilities of educa- 
tional value, but directly the idea was grasped of 
translating into dumb action the words the people 
of the story really said to each other, the possibili- 
ties grew with each attempt. 
In the next stage a halt was called in the miming 
of the stories when the players were baffled for want 
of a gesture, and the problem was presented to the 
whole class; for instance: How can we represent 
the fact that it is now 12 o’clock, the fateful hour 
in the Cinderella story 2 Among the suggestions 
was that of pointing to a real clock, followed by 
holding up two fingers side by side to represent 
the positions of the two hands at mid-day and mid- 
night. But the clock might not always be there, 
and we felt that we must have a more reliable sign. 
The drawing of a circle in the air, and holding up the 
two hands for ten and two fingers for twelve, satisfied 
for a time, till the question was raised, “ Are we 
to understand 12 noon or midnight ?” We were 
rather bound throughout by the actual surroundings,
-P-A-G-E-134
  116 CHILDREN’S STORIES 
and the girls decided to point to the window side 
of the room to represent “day,” and to the opposite 
wall when they meant “ night.” 
So with many a fruitful suggestion the mime of 
the story of Cinderella progressed to its dramatic end. 
The Greek story of Baucis and Philemon was 
once mimed by the same children, who could now 
play with dignity and smoothness; some of the — 
watchers however, who did not know the story, could 
not follow the entire plot. They realised that the 
two old people, a man and a woman, entertained two 
strangers in their cottage on the hillside, and that 
the playing children stoned them during their jour- 
ney. ‘The episode of the hospitality of the old 
couple being recognised, and being repaid by the 
heavenly strangers by a continual supply of food and — 
drink, was well shown. The fate of the hostile 
village below was not possible to follow in detail, 
but all who watched realised that the valley people 
were punished by death. It was the last part of the 
story which was obscure—no sign for trees had been 
decided upon, and a considerable amount of muddling 
took place here. 
The children were sometimes eager to act little 
scenes from their own lives, two children going to 
shop, or to school, a friend coming to tea with 
another, children playing together, picking flowers 
in the country, a mother teaching her girl to sew 
and to dust the house; simple little dialogues were 
introduced, and were understood easily by the 
watchers. But these rather commonplace little 
scenes gave way to far richer situations as the 
stock of stories grew, and again one realises how
-P-A-G-E-135
         VERSES, PLAYS AND MIME 117 
  tremendously stories widen the world for the child. 
It may be interesting to notice how some of the signs 
and movements expressive of definite ideas grew. 
The need of distinguishing the characters made itself 
felt quite soon, and resulted in the leader introducing 
(of course in dumb show) each character. This 
meant the coining of new signs, and signs for man, 
woman, boy, girl, baby were evolved; the short hair 
of the man was recognised from the long hair of the 
woman, by pointing to the neck in the first case, and 
to the shoulders in the second. The two further 
signs of lifting the hand to indicate tall or grown up, 
and lowering it to show short or not grown up, made 
the distinction between woman and girl, and man and 
boy. We quickly moved to the same sign as the 
Perse* schoolboys in denoting King and Queen, 
Prince and Princess—by drawing a circle in the air 
round the head to indicate the crown. A reminder 
of the stately character of these personages was 
needed sometimes as the children throughout tended 
to give their actions at far too rapid a speed. In 
this respect the difference between individual chil- 
dren is very marked indeed, some representing very 
jerky movements, while others show real beauty both 
in isolated and continuous action. The word Fairy 
proved a difficulty for a little time; a girl had to 
show, “Oh! how pleased I am to see you, dear 
Fairy !” She showed the emotion well enough, and 
combined it with a pretty gesture, large and stooping 
—the hands coming in welcome almost down to the 
ground. The criticism, however, brought out that

this was not distinctive enough—any beautiful and 
charming thing might be welcomed in this way. So 
we had to search for a sign for “ fairy.” We decided 
the characteristic smallness should be represented, 
and a little space between the first finger and the 
thumb was selected ; this was accompanied by a par- 
ticularly pleased and alert expression. 
The idea “ Far away in China” was at once ex- 
pressed by the reiterated backward wave of the 
hand, followed by the finger indicating the upward 
slant of the eyes characteristic of the Chinaman’s 
face. 
The relationship of “ Twins ” was carefully repre- 
sented by pointing to two girls of the same height 
who belonged to the same mother. “ Mother” was 
distinguished from “woman” by the extra gesture 
of pointing to her in connection with a child—and 
so on. 
Later on we had further to distinguish our charac- 
ters. At first the girls used to draw objects in the 
air with the finger, but it was found to be too vague, 
and was abandoned for much more particular and 
distinctive gestures—for instance, one girl tried to 
represent a doctor by drawing a medicine bottle in 
the air, after the accepted sign for man, and 
strengthened the part by miming the man carrying 
a bag. We failed to recognise these complicated 
actions, and later simplified them to the one charac- 
teristic action of the doctor, i.¢., the play of the 
fingers of the one hand on the wrist of the other 
(taking the pulse) after the sign for “ man.” 
“Soldier” was easily evolved by a very erect 
attitude, and with the “ Present arms” movements. .

“ Sailor,” “the man who by night and day is on 
the sea,” was shown by a billowing movement of 
the hand, followed by indications of night and day, 
these two movements elaborating the first sign for 
“man.” This was a very charming little flow of 
mime. Indeed, some of these explanatory introduc- 
tions were full of grace and were very pleasurable 
to watch when they were undertaken by the abler 
children. 
The priest or minister was shown by “the man 
who read from the open book.” 
The school master or mistress, sad to say, was un- 
hesitatingly represented, and instantly and unani- 
mously recognised as the person with an emphatic 
forefinger ! ! 
The “witch” was represented by the shaping of 
the hands in the air to make a pointed cap and wand 
after the sign “woman.” 
Miming has the double function of giving the 
child a means of expression and of offering his 
grown-up friends a peep into his mind. It is often 
illuminating to catch a glimpse of the concept the 
child has, which can only occasionally be divined 
from the words he uses. We continually find our- 
selves sorting the accidental from the essential char- 
acteristics in a really meaningful way. 
The words “rich” and “poor” once had to be 
mimed. Several attempts were made—a number 
of children assumed a lounging attitude with hands 
in pockets to represent the out-of-work man, and 
the rest associated “poor” with abject misery—a 
poor man seemed necessarily a miserable one. 
“Rich” was by practically all the class associated

with the fur-collared coat and cigar-in-mouth type. 
Children grow more critical as the art of miming 
proceeds, they begin to recognise some of the quali- 
ties which make for pleasurable and beautiful move- 
ments, they see that purposeless gestures obscure the 
meaning, and that smoothness and dignity add 
greatly to the pleasurable effect. 
Miming takes us into situations where we wrestle 
with difficulties as they rise in the need to communi- 
cate an idea or series of ideas to our comrades, in the 
medium of movement. s 
In all these activities, however, we see that the 
foundation is the story, and the more we can make 
our children free of this treasure and heritage, the 
richer their lives will undoubtedly be.

and the repetition element is marked in the musical re-

The deeper significance of the story need not be insisted 
upon; the teller may often appreciate the philosophy of a 
story, while the child hearer rejoices in the narrative alone.] 
UFFI sat by the road side with his little ham- 
mer in his hand; a pile of large flints on one 
side of him, and a pile of little chips and broken bits 
on the other. It was a sunny day, and Huffi whistled

and sang as he chipped . . . chipped . . . chipped, 
making the large stones into little ones, making the 
one heap larger as the other grew steadily smaller 
. . . for Huffi was a stone-breaker, the forerunner 
of the road-mender. 
The sun shone in the cloudless sky, a little breeze 
wavered amongst the grasses growing by the edge of 
the road, a skylark sang his joy in the happy world, 
and chip... chip... chirped the hammer to 
Huffi’s gay whistling. His dinner of bread and 
cheese lay beside him, and a little brook rippled 
through the fields behind the hedge, ready to give him 
clear water when he felt thirsty. Huffi had not a 
care in the world, and chip . . . chip . . . chirped 
the hammer, tap... tap... tap...chip...

* * * * 
Down the long, white, dusty road Huffi saw a 
small cloud of dust a-blowing, and heard the faint 
sound of distant hoofs, and presently he saw a gay 
cavalcade riding towards him. It was the King with 
his merry knights, and, as they rode gallantly by, with 
the sun shining on their armour, and the breeze play- 
ing with the rippling banners, Hufii’s heart grew sud- 
denly heavy, and the sound of his hammer, chip . . .

longer fell in tune with the bird’s song, and his lips 
forgot their whistling, and fell into a pout. 
“Ah, me! Ah, me!” sighed Huff, “if only 
Huffi the King might be !” 
And he heard a voice behind him saying: 
“ Be thou the King.” 
* * * *

HUFFI, THE STONE-BREAKER = 123 
So Huffi became the King and rode down the long, 
dusty road, past the two heaps of stones, where the 
little hammer lay between them. And he rode 
through all that pleasant land, and saw his vast 
possessions ; and pride and love of power grew in his 
heart, and he said: 
“T am all powerful, nothing is greater than the 
King.” And he rode disdainfully through a laden 
orchard, where apples hung golden and rosy. Then, 
as he looked at them and at the waving yellow corn 
lands beyond, his words were stayed, and he pon- 
dered deeply .. . 
“T cannot paint the corn,” he thought, “I cannot 
paint the cheeks of the hanging apples . . . I, the 
King, cannot bring colour to the face of the fruitful 
earth . . . It is the Sun, and he alone who can do 
this.” 
Then Huffi grew sad, and his pride in kingship 
died, as he thought of the power of the Sun. 
“Ah, me! Ah, me!” sighed Huff. “If only 
Huffi the Sun might be!” 
And he heard a voice behind him saying: 
“ Be thou the Sun.” 
Then the spirit of the King entered the fiery ball 
of the Sun, and he shone in all splendour on the 
smiling earth. 
*

And the spirit of Huffi rejoiced mightily, for he 
thought : 
“T am all powerful, nothing is greater than the 
sun. All growing things wait for my coming, and 
at my going they are sad; there is nothing mightier 
than the Sun !”

And a little cloud drifted up out of the west. 
It grew slowly, slowly, heavier, deeper, darker. It 
grew into a black bank of ugly rain-wrack, mounting, 
spreading, mounting, spreading, over all the sky. 
Over the land it crept, and people below hastened 
home. “For,” said they, “the sun is nearly blotted 
out, and the light and warmth have fled.” 
Then the spirit of Huffi within the Sun was sad, 
for, indeed, the black cloud had covered him and cut 
his shining rays from the country below; try as he 
would he could not pierce the cloud. 
Then the spirit of Huffi in the Sun lamented, 
for he knew that the cloud was mightier than 
himself. 
“Ah, me! Ah, me!” sighed he, “if only Huffi 
that cloud might be ! ” 
And he heard a voice behind him: 
“ Be thou the Cloud.” 
So the spirit of Huffi entered into the great cloud 
as it hung over the shivering earth. 
* * * * 
And the cloud came down in rain, in a tempest that 
washed and rushed in torrents through the land. 
And the spirit of Huffi rejoiced mightily as he tore 
through the country, sweeping everything before 
him; great trees lay rent on the ground, roofs, cattle 
and sheep were as straws in his pathway. 
“Nothing can withstand me; I am mightier than 
the strongest on earth,” cried the triumphant spirit 
of Huffi, in the roaring water. 
And as he swept on he came to a rock standing 
firmly in the earth. He dashed against it, but it 
stood unmoved . . . he swirled and beat against its

unshaken face—the spirit of Huffi in the water 
surged with all its gathered strength again against 
the rock . . . but the rock stood unmoved and quiet. 
Then the spirit of Huffi cried: 
“ The rock is stronger than I. Ah,me! Ah, me! 
If only Huffi the Rock might be ! ! ” 
And he heard a voice behind him saying: 
“ Be thou the Rock !” 
And the spirit of Huffi entered into the Rock 
standing steady and deep and great in the country- 
side.

Down the long, white, dusty road came the small

2. PAN AND THE BABE 
[This story, which has been adapted from the poem of 
Frank Sidgwick, “ A Christmas Legend,” illustrates the 
conflict of the departing and the arriving god discussed 
in Chapter I. It may be made to serve as a basis for ques- 
tions as suggested on page 79.] 
7 was a starry winter night; Pan made his leaping 
way over the hillside, down to the swollen river. 
Snow lay white, and its crunching under the hoofs 
of the goat, and the bleating of a bellwether were the 
only sounds to be heard in the quiet country-side. 
Pan was in no mood for his pipes; his weird music 
and his reflection as he had seen it in a still pool, 
earlier in the day, had seemed strange and alien; 
both mocked at his shaggy grey hair, as he himself 
had mocked those unwary humans who caught 
glimpses of him from time to time as he played by 
the reeds in the river. He had been vexed by a 
vague unrest all day, and now longing and lassitude 
fell upon him; his lively spirit, his very life, seemed 
slowly slipping from him. 
He came to rest by the side of the distraught 
bellwether . . . 
“ Bellwether, Bellwether, what do you say?” 
And the old sheep gave complaint... 
“The ewes have not been folded... Our 
shepherd is away . . . The snow covers our grazing 
. . . Our shepherd has left his flock.” 
Then Pan the Shepherd God got him up, and 
folded the silly, frightened sheep, and listened to old 
Bellwether’s story. 
“arly to-night came two shepherds,” said she. 
“ Over the hill they came, and they talked eagerly
-P-A-G-E-145
  
PAN AND THE BABE 127 
to our shepherd, ever pointing to the stars, and now 
and then they stilled their voices and listened . . . 
and it seemed to us that sweet sounds floated about 
us... sweeter than in springtime when all the air 
is full of the bleating of tender lambs and their fond 
dams ... And then our shepherd dropped his 
crook, and giving us not a thought, he turned him 
with the twain, and I saw the three shepherds go 
towards the distant roofs of Bethlehem, which we 
could see afar by the light of a great star.” .. . 
And Bellwether cried distressfully again, “ We have 
no shepherd. We have no shepherd! ” 
Then Pan moved strangely in his mind, leapt to 
his feet, and set his face towards Bethlehem. 
Before he reached the outer roofs he met the shep- 
herd, hurrying to his flock. At the moment of pass- 
ing, Pan spoke to him-of-the-radiant-face .. . 
“Shepherd, Shepherd, no shepherd art thou! !” 
And he answering cried, “Master, Master, no 
Master art thou! !” 
Then Pan, strangely drawn, half willingly, half 
unwillingly came to the stable’s open door, and 
softly entering, saw amid the gentle kine, the sleep- 
ing Babe lying in hay. 
Nearer drew Pan to the manger, till his grey hairs 
touched the face of the sleeping One. Then the 
little eyes opened, and like stars in their beauty, 
looked into the eyes of Pan; little hands struggled 
free of swaddling clothes, and patted the old yet 
ever young bearded face... 
Pan went blindly out into the night; his heart was 
melted within him; he sought the ease of tears in 
vain, for laughter-loving Pan had never wept. 
 
-P-A-G-E-146

The touch of little hands, the light of divine love 
shining from the Babe’s eyes were Pan’s undoing 
. . . He could not forget, he could not make his 
music . . . If he could but weep! .. . If he could 
So he wandered all that bitter night on the cold 
hillside, while the Babe lay safe and warm in his 
mother’s arms. He asked of all the animals the 
secret... How to weep?... How to weep? | 
He asked the coneys of the rocks... “Do 
you know the secret? Can you tell me how 
to weep?” And they said, “We do not 
know”... 
He went to the fox and the lynx, “Give me of 
your knowledge. Tell me, I pray you, how to weep.” 
. . . And they said, “ This thing is hid from us, we 
do not know.” 
And he came once more to the sheep, now safely 
folded, and he asked them, “ Tell me, silly sheep, 
for surely you must know, how to weep.” .. . But 
they said, “Indeed, we never knew, and now we 
shall never need to know, for we have a shepherd, we 
have a shepherd.” 
The fish in the river, the birds in the branches 
could not tell Pan how to weep . . . Then Pan made 
his way once more to the stable in Bethlehem, and 
whispered to the gentle kine, “ Tell me, tell me how 
to weep.” And they puffed out their fragrant breath 
and said, “We never knew, and now we shall never 
need to know, for we have seen the Babe of 
Bethlehem.” 
So Pan, with bursting heart, and untouched pipe, 
went wandering forlorn on Christmas night.

  THE LEGEND OF ST. ANDREW 129 
3. THE LEGEND OF ST. ANDREW 
[This version of an ancient legend illustrates the weav- 
ing of a story from several strands found in wider read- 
ing. It is mainly adapted from Stopford Brook’s transla- 
tion of the “ Andreas” in The History of Early English 
Interature. The style has been suited to the Biblical char- 
acter of the story. 
The “ Andreas” itself is an Anglo-Saxon poem, written 
perhaps by a sailor or one who dwelt on the sea shore, who 
had. listened to the story from the lips of a monk who, in 
his turn, may have had it from the Greek.] 
“Lo, from days of yore we have heard of twelve heroes, 
famous under the stars . . . thegns of the Lord.” 
OW it came to pass that the Lord appeared to 
Andrew in a dream, saying, “Go and deliver 
thy brother Matthew, who lieth in prison in the Land 
of the Man Eaters.” And Andrew the Fisherman of 
Galilee said, “Nay, Lord, how can I make my way 
over the deep waters of the unknown seas? One of 
thine angels in High Heaven might more easily do 
this, for he knows the goings of the sea, and the paths 
thereof, but I know them not. Moreover the Earls 
of Elsewhere are unknown to me. I cannot go!” 
Then did the Lord answer Andrew in his dream, 
“Nay, Andrew! that thou shouldest be so slow of 
heart to fare upon this way! Nevertheless must 
thou go. At early dawn, at the marge of the sea, 
thou shalt step upon a ship, and she shall carry thee 
over the salt waves upon thy way.” 
Now when the day was come, Andrew arose early 
and went down to the sand links towards the sea, 
and his thegns with him, trampling on the shingle; 
the ocean thundered, the billows beat upon the shore,
-P-A-G-E-148
    130 CHILDREN’S STORIES 
and the salt wind blew wet upon their faces. Now as 
they stood upon the marge, they saw three sailors 
in a ship near to the land, and these were Almighty 
God and His angels twain, but Andrew knew not 
who they were. “Whence come you, and whither 
do you go?” cried Andrew. ‘“ We sought this land, 
but much grieved were we by the sea, and sorely 
driven of the wind. We go to the Land of the Man 
Eaters,” they answered. ‘Take me there,” said 
Andrew, remembering his dream of the night, “ Little 
gold can I give, but God will reward thee.” 
“ Strangers go not there,” answered the Lord, stand- 
ing in the ship. “‘ Dost thou wish to lose thy life ?” 
“Nay, but go I must!” cried Andrew, “though I 
lose my life.” 
“Then will we take thee gladly, when thou hast 
paid thy fare, and those of the good men with thee,” 
answered the sailor. Then said Andrew, sore in 
need of friends, “I have no beaten gold, nor silver 
store, nor lands, nor rings.” ... “How then 
wouldst thou seek the sea hills and the cold waters 
of the deep? Thou hast nothing for comfort on 
the street of the sea. Hard is his way of life and 
work who long makes trial of the paths of weary 
water.” Then answered Andrew: “So the Lord 
commanded. He bid us take no treasure for the 
journey, but to fare over the deep waters. His 
thegns are we, chosen for His messengers... ” 
Then did God Almighty make answer: 
“Tf thou art indeed His thegn, we will take thee 
and thy thegns.” 
So they stepped into the ship, and over the swing- 
ing waves sat Andrew by the Heavenly Steersman 
 
-P-A-G-E-149
  THE LEGEND OF ST. ANDREW 131 
(the Lord Himself), but the men knew Him not. 
And now there came down a storm of wind, the 
waves crushed together, the ship groaned, and the 
sailors were in great jeopardy; so that the thegns 
of Andrew were sore afraid. Then the Steersman 
offered to put them safe ashore, but they would not 
leave their lord. 
“Whither should we go? In every land should 
we be shamed before all folk, when they spoke of 
those who stood with their lord in danger and in 
need.” 
Then did Andrew give them heart of courage and 
comforted them, for said he: 
“Christ stilled the waters of Galilee, and in very 
sooth, I tell thee now, the living God will never leave 
unhelped an earl on earth if courage fail him not.” 
So with the Heavenly Helmsman sitting by, did 
Andrew tell the tale of that other storm, saying: 
“ And our Master lay asleep in the ship, and we 
came to Him and awoke Him, saying, ‘ Master, 
Master, we perish... .’ And He awoke, and 
rebuked the wind and the raging of the waters, and 
they ceased and there was a calm.” 
So then did Christ listen to the tale of Christ 
stilling the storm. .. . 
Then Andrew’s thegns, comforted by his story of 
that Lord of Power, fell asleep, and only Andrew 
and the Helmsman remained awake in the rocking 
ship. Then did Andrew watch the Heavenly figure 
as he steered cunningly over the wild waves, and 
he marvelled at his skill. 
“Teach me,” said he, “the art whereby thou 
steerest the ship as it pusheth through the deep.
-P-A-G-E-150
182 CHILDREN’S STORIES 
The sea welter lingereth at the sides, the foaming 
wave striketh the bulwark, the bark is at full speed, 
yet like to a bird doth it glide over the waters. More 
skilful art in any mariner have I never seen. Thou 
art young, and canst not have spent many years 
upon the sea.” 
Then answered the Heavenly Helmsman: 
“ Oft it befalleth that we go down into the trough 
of the wave, and ride upon its crest, and are sore 
buffeted by winds and waters, but God’s will is more 
than the flood’s rage, and it is plain that thou art 
His man, for the deep sea straightway knew that thou 
hadst the grace of the Holy Ghost. The surging surf 
went back, and fear stilled the deep bosomed wave.” 
Then was Andrew exceeding glad, and together 
the twain talked of that Lord of Power who healed 
the sick and was the sailors’ Friend. The long hours 
were filled with Andrew’s tales of the Man of Galilee, 
while the ship sped on her way, and the Heavenly 
Helmsman listened. 
Then did sleep come upon Andrew, and he lay 
as did his thegns, in dreams. And Christ bade his 
angels bear these wearied ones to the land where 
they would be, and there they left them sleeping on 
the highway, near the city of the Man Eaters. 
Now when morning was come, Andrew and his 
thegns awoke, and knew that the Christ had brought 
them thither. 
“Tt was the Heavenly Helmsman, Christ, Who led 
us across the realm of the oar,” said they, wonder- 
ing. “ We too, have had our adventure.” 
And as they praised God, they saw coming to them 
over the strand the young Helmsman Himself.

  THE BLACK BULL OF NORROWAY 133 
“Hail to thee, Andrew,” He cried. “No storms 
shall ever overwhelm thy soul.” 
“ How could I not know Thee on the journey?” 
answered Andrew. “ That were a sin.” 
“Not so great,” replied Christ, “as when thou 
saidst thou couldst not go over the unknown seas, 
and meet the unknown Earls of Elsewhere. But now 
arise, set Matthew free, bear many pains, for war 
is destined for thee. Let no grim battle spear make 
thee turn from Me. Be ever eager for glory. 
Remember what pains I bore when the rood was 
upreared, and Lo, I am with you alway.” 
4. THE BLACK BULL OF NORROWAY 
[This version is reprinted from Fairy Gold, edited by 
Ernest Rhys. The story is analysed, as an aid to clarity 
and force in the telling, in Chapter IV.] 
“To wilder measures next they turn: 
The black, Black Bull of Norroway! 
Sudden the tapers cease to burn, 
The minstrels cease to play!” 
ey upon a time there lived a King who had 
three daughters; the two eldest were proud and 
ugly, but the youngest was the gentlest and most 
beautiful creature ever seen, and the pride not only 
of her father and mother, but of all in the land. As 
it fell out, the three Princesses were talking one 
night of whom they would marry. “TI will have no 
one lower than a King,” said the eldest Princess. 
The second would take a Prince or a great Duke 
even. “Pho, pho,” said the youngest, laughing, 
“you are both so proud; now, I would be content
-P-A-G-E-152
  134 CHILDREN’S STORIES 
with the Black Bull o’ Norroway.” Well, they 
thought no more of the matter till the next morning, 
when, as they sat at breakfast, they heard the most 
dreadful bellowing at the door, and what should it 
be but the Black Bull come for his bride. You may 
be sure they were all terribly frightened at this, for 
the Black Bull was one of the most horrible crea- 
tures ever seen in the world. And the King and 
Queen did not know how to save their daughter. At 
last they determined to send him off with the old 
henwife. So they put her on his back, and away 
he’ went with her till he came to a great black forest, 
when, throwing her down, he returned, roaring louder 
and more frightfully than ever. They then sent, 
one by one, all the servants, then the two eldest 
Princesses; but not one of them met with any better 
treatment than the old henwife, and at last they 
were forced to send their youngest and favourite 
child. 
Far she travelled upon the Black Bull, through 
many dreadful forests and lonely wastes, till they 
came at last to a noble castle, where a large company 
was assembled. The lord of the castle pressed them 
to stay, though much he wondered at the lovely 
Princess and her strange companion. But as they 
went in among the guests, the Princess espied a pin 
sticking in the Black Bull’s hide, which she pulled 
out, and, to the surprise of all, there appeared not a 
frightful wild beast, but one of the most beautiful 
Princes ever beheld. 
You may believe how delighted the Princess was 
to see him fall at her feet, and thank her for breaking 
his cruel enchantment. There were great rejoicings 
in the castle at this, but, alas! in the midst of them
-P-A-G-E-153
  THE BLACK BULL OF NORROWAY 135 
he suddenly disappeared, and though every place 
was sought, he was nowhere to be found. 
The Princess, from being filled with happiness, 
was all but broken-hearted. She determined, how- 
ever, to seek through all the world for him, and many 
weary ways she went, but for a long, long while 
nothing could she hear of her lover. Travelling 
once through a dark wood, she lost her way, and as 
night was coming on, she thought she must now cer- 
tainly die of cold and hunger; but seeing a light 
through the trees, she went on till she came to a 
little hut, where an old woman lived, who took her 
in, and gave her both food and shelter. In the 
morning the old wifie gave her three nuts, that she 
was not to break till her heart was “like to break 
and owre again like to break”; so, showing her the 
way, she bade God speed her, and the Princess once 
more set out on her wearisome journey. 
She had not gone far till a company of lords and 
ladies rode past her, all talking merrily of the fine 
doings they expected at the Duke o’ Norroway’s 
wedding. Then she came up to a number of people 
carrying all sorts of fine things, and they, too, were 
going to the Duke’s wedding. At last she came to a 
castle, where nothing was to be seen but cooks and 
bakers, some running one way, and some another, 
and all so busy that they did not know what to do 
first. Whilst she was looking at all this, she heard 
a noise of hunters behind her, and some one cried 
out— 
“ Make way for the Duke o’ Norroway! ” 
And who should ride past but the Prince and a 
beautiful lady. 
You may be sure her heart was now “like to
-P-A-G-E-154
136 CHILDREN’S STORIES 
break and owre again like to break” at this sad 
sight, so she broke one of the nuts, and out came a 
wee wi rding wool. The Princess then went 
into the castle, and asked to see the lady, who no 
sooner saw the wee wifie so hard at work, than she 
offered the Princess anything in her castle for it. 
“T will give it to you,” said she, “only on con- 
dition that you put off for one day your marriage 
with the Duke o’ Norroway, and that I may go into 
his room alone to-night.” 
So anxious was the lady for the nut, that she con- 
sented. And when dark night was come, and the 
Duke fast asleep, the Princess was put alone into his 
chamber. Sitting down by his bedside, she began 
singing: 
“ar hae I sought ye, near am I brought to ye, 
Dear Duke 0’ Norroway, will ye no turn and speak to 
me?” 
Though she sang this over and over again, the Duke 
never wakened, and in the morning the Princess had 
to leave him, without his knowing she had ever been 
there. She then broke the second nut, and out came 
a wee wifie spinning,..which..so..delighted the lady, 
that she readily agreed to put off her marriage 
another day for it; but the Princess came no better 
speed the second night than the first, and, almost in 
despair, she broke the last nut, which contained _a 
_wee_wifie reeling, and on the same condition as 
‘before, the lady got possession of it. 
When the Duke was dressing in the morning, his 
man asked him what the strange singing and moaning 
that had been heard in his room for two nights meant.
-P-A-G-E-155
  
GOBLIN MARKET: A PLAY 137 
“T heard nothing,” said the Duke; “ it could only 
have been your fancy.” 
“Take no sleeping-draught to-night, and be sure 
to lay aside your pillow of heaviness,” said the man, 
“and you also will hear what for two nights has 
kept me awake.” 
The Duke did so, and the Princess coming in, sat 
down sighing at his bedside, thinking this the last 
time she might ever see him. The Duke started up 
when he heard the voice of his dearly-loved Princess; 
and with many endearing expressions of surprise and 
joy, explained to her that he had long been in the 
_power of a witch-wife, whose spells over him were 
now happily ended by their once again meeting. 
The Princess, happy to be the means of breaking 
his second evil spell, consented to marry him, and 
the wicked witch-wife, who fled that country, afraid 
of the Duke’s anger, has never since been heard of. 
All was hurry and preparation in the castle, and the 
marriage which took place happily ended the adven- 
tures of the Black Bull o’ Norroway, and the wander- 
ings of the King’s daughter.~~~~

Market,” which we made one day during the writing of

making it just then, and so we made it. Lizzie might 
quite well sing it, however, as she waits alone by the 
Brook in Act ITI., Scene 1, and probably if we had worked 
over the whole play a little longer, we should have come 
to this, for Lizzie must be doing something as she waits 
alone.]

resources available for teachers and students who will use the

Some books published over here give material similar to that

The original notes have been retained almost intact because 
they are so interesting and suggestive even without the books. 
A number of lovely editions written for the children them-

methods suggested by Miss Bone for working over source ma-

could accomplish with all the work in the world that we may 
well use them for our models and sometimes adopt them alto-

Artuurian Cycie. No hero of story and romance is so 
popular as the almost entirely legendary Arthur, King of 
Britain. Around this figure, of whom we have hardly 
any authentic knowledge, has arisen a mass of material, 
both French and British. Indeed, at one time it was held 
that the British stories were derived originally from the 
French, but later opinion has decided that the country of 
the hero’s birth, and the scene of his famous exploits must 
have retained its own legends, the first written accounts 
of Arthur, which are purely British. The basis, then, of 
the British material is to be found in Nennius Historia 
Britonum, which later furnished the material for the f.r 
more important and fuller Historie of Geoffrey of Mon- 
mouth, 1136. There arose in Europe a great prose ro- 
mance of Merlin; the first part dealt with Merlin himself, 
and a second part, known as the Suite de Malory’s Morte 
d’ Arthur, offered an abridged translation. Later came a 
great compilation known as the prose Launcelot. 
To sum up, the tradition of which Arthur is the real 
hero is contained in the chronicles above mentioned, the 
Merlin, and the prose Launcelot. 
There is a Middle English romance of Merlin originally 
written in French, an English translation of which exists 
in a unique MS. in the library of the University of Cam- 
bridge. Of chief interest, however, for the English reader, 
is the Morte d’Arthur of Sir Thomas Malory, 1469, first 
aa by Caxton, 1485. This was written in twenty-one 
books. 
The most easily obtainable text for the story teller 
here is:— 
Le Morte d’Arthur; Sir Thomas Malory’s book of 
King Arthur and of his noble knights of the Round 
Table. The text of the Caxton edition; edited with an 
introduction by Sir Edward Strachey. (Globe ed.) 
Macmillan. 
Another source is:— 
The Mabinogion; edited by Lady Charlotte Guest.

dealing chiefly with Arthur and his Knights. Three of

these romances, Owen and Lunet, Peredur et Evrawe, 
Geraint and Enid, agree in many important points with 
three French romances of Chrétien de Troyes, the 
Chevalier au Lyon, Percival le Gallois, Eric et Enid; 
all of these were produced in the last half of the twelfth 
century. It was thought originally that the Mabino- 
gion Tales were derived from the French of Chrétien 
de Troyes, but later opinion holds that the Mabinogion 
represents “the insular version” as preserved among 
the Celts of Britain.

Among critical studies notice:— 
Le Morte d’Arthur of Sir Thomas Malory and its 
Sources, by Vida Scudder. Dutton. An interesting and 
comprehensive study and appreciation of the great story 
both as “a social document and as a work of art.” Full 
bibliography. This is the study most likely to be found 
in libraries here. 
King Arthur and his Knights, by J. L. Weston. 
(Popular Studies in Mythology, No. 4.) A story of 
Arthurian romance. Nutt, London. 1899. This is in- 
teresting to the student, and gives briefly in a small 
volume the chief sources of the Arthurian stories. 
King Arthur in History and Romance, by W. L. 
Jones. (Cambridge Manuals of Science and Litera- 
ture.) Macmillan. This discusses the sources with

same writer in Vol. I., Cambridge History of English 
Literature. 
Flourishing of Romance, and the Rise of Allegory,

Following is a list of versions that can be used by the 
story teller and that children enjoy reading them- 
selves :— 
The Boy’s King Arthur; edited by Sidney Lanier; 
illus. by N. C. Wyeth. Scribner. There is also a 
cheaper edition without illustration. 
Knightly Legends of Wales; or, The Boy’s Mabino- 
gion; being the earliest Welsh tales of King Arthur in 
the famous Red Book of Hergest; edited by Sidney 
Lanier. Scribner. 
Stories of King Arthur and the Round Table, by Bea- 
trice Clay; illus. by Dora Curtis. Dutton. Beautifully 
told selection for a little older children than the Macleod 
version. 
The Book of King Arthur and His Noble Knights, 
by Mary Macleod. Stokes. Follows Malory closely and 
is both readable and popular with children. 
Story of King Arthur and His Knights. Story of the 
Champions of the Round Table. Story of Sir Launce- 
lot and His Companions. Story of the Grail and the 
Passing of Arthur, by Howard Pyle. Scribner. Mr. 
Pyle did not follow any text absolutely but he was wise 
in medieval lore and tuned to the spirit of the stories. 
His versions are beautifully written and his drawings 
do much to aid the story teller in vivifying his own 
images. Both boys and girls love to read these. 
Aspsornsen, P. C. Tales from the Fijeld, a series of 
popular tales from the Norse; trans. by Sir George Dasent. 
Putnam. There is a valuable introduction of delightful 
reading giving the origin and diffusion of myth. The 
characteristics of the Norse myth are next dealt with, 
followed by the body of the book, a collection of the peo- 
ple’s tales, “ Boots and His Brothers,” “ The Seven Fools,” 
“ Farmer Weathersky,” “ The Master Maid,” etc. See also,

Bariwe-Goutp, 8. A Book of Fairy Tales. Methuen, 
London. Gives the less well known fairy tales, gathered 
from a wide area, followed by helpful notes on sources. 
“The Gardener Prince” story is based on an old English 
ballad, “The Garland of Princely Lovers,” printed about 
the beginning of the eighteenth century. “Southern- 
wood” is a story woven of the strands “Tam Lin,” “The 
Golden Ball,” and fairy-lore in connection with change- 
lings. “ Desideratus,” from an old Norman-French story 
of the twelfth century, is based in its turn on Celtic tradi- 
tion and myth. “The Crown of White Roses” is based on 
an English poem of 1460. Out of print but still to be 
found in old collections. 
Barina-Goutp, S. Legends of Old Testament Char- 
acters. Macmillan. For those interested in legendary 
matter round about Old Testament characters. There are 
an astonishing number of legends connected with the 
people of the Bible, and it is very interesting to hear 
more stories of Noah, Moses, Joshua, Solomon, than we 
read in the Old Testament. Here is the death of Abra- 
ham according to the Mussulman’s legend. The Angel 
of Death was unwilling to take the soul of the patriarch 
without his consent, and though he was 200 years old he 
was hale and hearty; life was still sweet to him for his 
vigour was not abated. The Angel, therefore, took the 
form of an old man, trembling and bowed with age, 
having no teeth and unable to see clearly. In this guise 
he visited Abraham in his tent. “How old are you?” 
asked Abraham. “I am two hundred and two years old,” 
mumbled the ancient one. “What!!” cried his host in 
consternation. “Shall I be like that in two years’ time! 
So feeble and helpless! O Lord, suffer me to depart, send 
to me the Angel of Death.” So the Angel took him as he 
knelt in prayer.

Browvutr Saca. A whole library full of books deals with 
this saga, and we should expect this, for it is not only a 
tale crammed with stirring incident, but it belongs to us 
and beats in the blood of us islanders. It is our own 
saga; perhaps it was sung in England across the seas and 
brought here by the Angles and Saxons. Collected about 
Ethelfrith’s time, given in the Northumbrian dialect, 
translated into Wessex, it belongs to us all, and it is that 
translation we have now. In it we have the vivid, vigor- 
ous pictures of how our forefathers lived and strove, of 
how they loved and died. The following books should 
help us in our preparation for the telling of a series of 
these stories, with Beowulf as hero, of whom Wulfgar 
said, “ Never saw I a greater Earle nor one of a more 
matchless air.” 
The Tale of Beowulf sometime King of the Folk of 
the Weder Geats; trans. by William Morris and A. J. 
Wyatt. Longmans, Green. This has a clear, short in- 
troduction, and the Saga is straightforwardly given in 
rhythmic English. 
Beowulf; a new verse translation for fireside and 
class room, by W. E. Leonard. Century. Includes 
comments and word list and some illustrations. “For 
anyone, young or old, in school or out, who may want 
to read the story, as being a story very much alive, and 
want to hear some echoes of the old verse-musiec, as being 
music with its own wide range of pathos, wrath, pride, 
love of mankind, and heroic life.”

Rome. Estes and Lauriat, 1877. Every story teller for-

stories already delightfully told, though many could be 
further worked up. The commentaries on the stories are 
as full of interest as the stories themselves. The tales 
were collected by word of mouth from the people, the 
localities from which they have been drawn are chiefly 
Palombara, Capranica, Loreto, Sinigaglia, Viterbo, Pales- 
trina, Rome. We have “Legends When Jesus Christ 
Walked the Earth.” Here we see the Madonna taking 
her babe through the lupin fields, and later the Christ 
asking a poor little old woman for a lodging, and giving 
her a rich return; settling a dispute at the Temple Gate 
between age and youth, and many more lovely pictures. 
The prisoner Peter we see escaping in many miraculous 
ways other than the one we read of in the Bible; there is 
a particular charm in these old legends. The collection 
falls under the four heads of “Favole,” Fairy Tales,

gossip appear. Out of print, but still in old collections.

This has a good introduction before telling the stories, 
quoting several authorities on the significance of these 
myths. The Gods are “ assembled together, Odin the Wan- 
derer, Odin on the Air Throne, seeing over the whole 
world, Odin the Summer, as Odur, the Patron of Battles, 
the Chosen of the Slain, the Pledger of the One Eye, 
drinking from Miner’s horn... Tyr, the Shining, the 
Warrior God, the Pledger of one hand . . . Thor, whose 
dwelling is in heaven, God of the storm, of cultivation, the 
warrior . . . Frey, the Summer, God of the fruitful year, 
the pledger of his sword.”

once, while others are the better for thoroughly working 
up as suggested in Chapter IV. Some of these stories are 
hardly suitable for children, and perhaps the better plan 
is to keep them on the adult book-shelf and use them as 
a treasure store; much depends upon the point of view 
taken in regard to the influence of folklore on child life.

on account of the introductions and story material. 
Macxenzin, D. A. Teutonic Myth and Legend. Gres- 
ham, London. A large book with a most helpful intro- 
duction, followed by the tales. We are offered a com- 
prehensive survey of the divine and heroic literature of 
the Teutonic people, which grew up at various periods and 
in different districts, under the influence of common 
tribal traditions. The drama of northern mythology is 
reconstructed in continuous narrative form. Grouped to- 
gether are the various tales regarding adventurous jour- 
neys made by heroes to Hela. The prose renderings of the 
heroic narratives include the Beowulf epic, the Balder- 
Hother Romance, the Hanet Legend, the Saga of the 
Volsunga, the Lay of the Nibelungs, and the less familiar 
Dietrich Legends, in which the deeds of the primitive 
Thor are attached to the memory of the Gothic Emperor 
of Rome. In all these literary productions the develop- 
ment of early myths can be traced, and their internal evi- 
dences regarding beliefs and customs and habits of life 
are of »mdoubted historical interest.

series. The pictures are so charming, and the pages so 
small, the print so big, that before a child can read to him-

They combine a feeling of American countryside and city 
with the attitude of the American child or the child in 
the grownup who loves great beauty in sudden flashes, 
who is capable of the most arrant nonsense, who juggles 
words just for their sounds, who is thoughtful and philo- 
sophical, serious and playful, whose imagination is never 
stilled and who sees poetry anywhere. 
An artist who has spent much study on medieval archi- 
tecture said it grew from a people who had a profound 
and rich love of humanity that expressed itself in beau- 
tiful cathedrals and its attendant humor in gargoyles. 
Architects have lost that particular sense of humor; they 
can’t play that way to-day, but here is a poet who can 
and does. 
A small boy of seven, an American boy in Paris, came 
into the room where his mother was talking with a friend. 
His mother said, “Here is the one who gave you the 
* Rootabaga Stories.’” The youngster walked right across 
the room with his hand outstretched and a beaming smile. 
“Oh!” he said, “ Henry Hagglyhoagly, wasn’t that a funny 
name?” Then he sat down and conversed about The 
Potato Face Blind Man and the others and when he had

seen him at ease and unconscious with a stranger. The 
stories had freed him. No wonder our children love the 
Rootabagas; they express something that has never been 
expressed for them before.

Lawson, J. ©. Modern Greek Folklore and Ancient 
Greek Religion: A Study in Survivals. Putnam. This 
book, though not deliberately written for the general 
reader, is by no means heavy, and would well repay the 
attention of any one interested in Greek Myth. It con- 
tains chapters on Modern Folklore as a source for the study 
of Ancient Religion, the Survival of Tradition, the Sur- 
vival of Pagan Deities. 
Maccuttocu, J. A. The Childhood of Fiction. Dut- 
ton. The writer surveys and interprets the incidents and 
origins of folk tales by the methods of the anthropological 
school. He shows that the key unlocking their meaning 
is found in the beliefs and practices of past ages. There 
are suggestive chapters, showing how many folk stories 
have “ preserved the memories of the sway of taboo ”—the 
forbidden thing in religion and social custom. Two 
groups of folklore illustrate this: (a) “Bluebeard”; (b) 
“Cupid and Psyche,” “Lost Husband,” “Beauty and 
Beast.” In the study of “Jack and the Beanstalk,” to 
which group of stories (The Magic Tree) a whole chapter

is given, we see how a “primitive mythological way of 
regarding the universe has suggested the chief incident of 
our well-known nursery tale.” Many other folk stories 
are discussed in connection with primitive ideas of life, 
such as the Renewal of Life in the Dead, the Separable 
Soul, Inanimate Objects with Magical and Human Quali- 
ties, the Significance of the Clever Youngest Son, the 
Dragon Sacrifice, Friendly Animals, etc. There is a val- 
uable bibliography, and indeed the book is one which 
should prove most helpful and illuminating to the tellers 
of folk stories. Out of print but still in library collec-

D. SiaNrFicaNcE or FoLKLORE IN THE LIFE OF THE 
| INDIVIDUAL 
Those gel to read round about the subjects of Day 
Dreams, Fantasies, and the Folk tale as reflections of the 
unconscious element in child and savage mentality, moral- 
ised in transmission through the ages, would find much 
to interest them in the following :— 
Burt, Cyrm. “The Dreams and Day Dreams of a 
Delinquent Girl .” Journal of Experimental Pedagogy, 
1921-1922. Reprints might possibly be had from Mr. 
Northend, Printer, West Street, Sheffield. Mr. Cyril Burt 
gives an interesting analysis showing the grievous influence 
of the “ Cinderella” story on an abnormal girl’s life. He 
suggests that strands from undesirable folklore may set up 
such a tangle in the unseen fabric of the child’s nature, 
that the natural rhythm of the weaving in later years may 
be endangered and pulled awry. It seemed so in Nellie’s 
ease. This girl of sixteen was constantly in trouble for 
stealing and lying, and unruly conduct; the mainspring 
of her naughtiness was found through quiet talks with the 
psycho-analyst. Her dreams and day dreams were gradu- 
ally revealed and interpreted. Among other things the 
“ Cinderella ” story seems to have kept Nellie in thrall, 
arresting development, and provoking many conflicts. The 
unhappy child at home interpreted the outer world in terms 
of her fairy tale, and the little misunderstandings and 
restrictions of everyday life were exaggerated; so she made 
her way of escape through the Dream Gateway into that 
land where her dress was changed into a queen’s robe, and 
her bare neck laden with sparkling jewels. This happened 
with fatal ease, and at last it was too much trouble to 
distinguish at all between the two worlds, the more delight- 
ful one remained in consciousness, and the dweller in fairy- 
land became the untrustworthy, brooding, erratic, adoles- 
cent, bound in the infantile stage, when she should have

classification may be somewhat misleading, as children 
vary considerably in development and outlook. Moreover, 
one period often overlaps another; for instance, the de- 
light in rhythmic utterance is not only to be found in the 
nursery but also in the play and work room of the older 
child. The book will, however, be very helpful to those 
who are aware of this difficulty in classification.

APPENDIX 
FAIRIES: SPIRITS OF THE ETHER 
HOUGH the majority of people will no doubt lean 
to the theory of the subjective origin of fairies sug- 
gested in Chapter II., there are some to whom the Little 
People are too real to be denied more independent exist- 
ence. 
W. B. Yeats, for instance, reminds us that “many poets 
and all mystics and occult writers everywhere, in all ages, 
have declared that behind the visible are chains and chains 
of conscious beings, who are not of heaven, but of earth, 
who have no inherent form, but change according to their 
whim or the mind that sees them... .” “They are, 
perhaps, human souls in the crucible, these creatures of 
whim” ... and that “we must conceive of all nature as 
being possessed, crowded with spiritual beings, and with 
no line dividing good from bad, every vine, tree, mountain, 
and river with a spirit inhabitant . . .” “Somewhere out 
of the void there is a perpetual dribble of souls, and these 
souls pass through many shapes before they incarnate as 
men, hence the nature spirits. They are invisible except 
at rare moments and times. They inhabit the interior 
elements, whilst we live upon the outer and the gross. 
Some float perpetually through space, and the motion of 
the planets drives them hither and thither.” 1 
In The Coming of the Fairies, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 
gives reproductions of the famous Cottingham photos, and 
evidence for the fairies, and in The Hidden Side of Things, 
Mr. Leadbeater has a suggestive chapter on Nature spirits 
and the Fairy Creation. He claims that sometimes these 
sprites are seen, owing to the presence of one of two con- 
ditions, the exercising of the power the nymphs have of 
drawing about themselves a “ veil of physical matter,” so 
1Irish Fairy and Folk mies te by W. B. Yeats. 
 
-P-A-G-E-212
  194 APPENDIX 
that they eames for a short time, or the heightened 
sensibility of the mortal, so that he is able to perceive them 
in their etheric state. There are few mortals who have a 
keen enough desire to seek to raise their power of vision; 
who are content to be as blind in our degree as the “ four- 
clawed mole,” the “hornéd bat,’ and the “barn owl” in 
the “burning day,” for 
“Blind as are 
These three to me, 
So, blind to Some-One 
I must be.” 1 
Mr. Leadbeater thinks that “the indwelling life of the 
Nature spirit comes from the same Solar Deity as our own, 
and will return to Him just as ours will,” but that it pro- 
ceeds along a different line, one that has thrown off the 
denser physical matter early, and is developing in the 
etheric. 
The lower nature spirits are said to evolve into the sur- 
face fairies, the type best known to us, and an interesting 
distinction is drawn between the two types of fairy crea- 
tion, especially devoted to the care of flowers, suggesting 
kindred thoughts to those given in Chapter I. on the influ- 
ence of creative thought on the making of the gods. 
He distinguishes between the fairy who is a link in a 
chain of evolution, where life has come up through the 
corns and grasses, the bees and ants, to the nature spirits, 
and so to the surface fairies—those whose continuing 
series runs through the salamanders or fire spirits, and 
the air spirits into the great and lovely company of the 
angels—and the little creatures whose life is not so bound 
in the chain of life, having but the Thought Form of one 
of the Great Beings in charge of the vegetable kingdom. 
“When one of these Great Ones has a new idea connected 
with one of the kinds of plants or flowers which are under 
his charge, he often creates a thought form for the special 
purpose of carrying out this idea. It usually takes the 
form either of an etheric model of the flower itself, or of 
1 All but Blind,” Peacock Pie, Walter de la Mare.
-P-A-G-E-213
  APPENDIX 195 
a little creature which hangs round the plant or flower all 
through the time that the buds are forming, and gradually 
builds them into the shape and colour of which the angel 
has thought. But as soon as the plant has fully grown, 
or the flower has opened, its work is over, and its power 
is exhausted, . . . and it simply dissolves, because the will 
‘to do that piece of work was the only soul it had.” It 
must have been a fairy of this kind that the poet heard 
singing at the close of its little temporary life: 
“Overhead! look overhead! 
’Mong the blossoms white and red— 
Look up, look up. I flutter now 
On this flush pomegranate bough, 
See me! ’tis this silvery bill 
Ever cures the good man’s ill. 
Shed no tear! Shed no tear! 
The flower will bloom another year. 
Adieu, adieu! I fly, adieu! 
I vanish in the heaven’s blue— 
Adieu! Adieu.” 1

Editor’s Introduction 
Ir is impossible for any person to read very much 
of present-day educational literature with pleasure 
and understanding unless he is acquainted to some 
extent with the method and the terminology em- 
ployed in conducting and presenting the results of 
statistical investigation. The character of educa- 
tional literature has undergone a fundamental change 
during the past ten or fifteen years. Doubtless some 
of the readers of these lines can remember the time 
when articles and books relating to educational 
values, methods, or administration rarely, if ever, 
contained tables of data or graphs showing the dis- 
tribution of the facts bearing upon any phase of 
educational procedure. In those days a teacher 
hardly ever — probably never — came across in her 
professional reading such terms as correlation co- 
efficient, median, mode, variability, frequency tables, 
frequency surface, standard deviation, probability curve, 
percentile ranks, and so on. But choose at random 
twenty-five books or articles on educational subjects 
that have recently appeared and that are regarded as 
up-to-date, and it will undoubtedly be found that the 
content of twenty of them is based upon investiga- 
tions involving statistical method, and that the con- 
clusions are phrased in terms which can be compre-

hended only when one is familiar with statistical 
modes of organizing and presenting data. 
The time is passing rapidly when one can safely 
discuss most educational subjects without having 
first made a statistical investigation of the topics 
which he treats. Formerly educational writers dis- 
cussed problems of values, methods, and adminis- 
tration without any attempt to be statistically sound 
and consistent in their premises or conclusions. They 
relied upon “‘reason” to guide them accurately in 
matters pertaining to educational procedure. They 
analyzed problems under consideration, and on the 
basis of experience, logic, or “common sense” they 
deduced principles without deeming it necessary 
to determine to what extent these principles would 
hold good in the concrete situations to which they 
related. But to-day we have slight confidence in 
the validity or value of principles arrived at in 
this fashion. We demand of anyone who presumes 
to speak authoritatively upon educational themes 
that he shall first have gathered the data pertaining 
to the themes in an accurate way, and that he 
shall then have treated the data so as to clarify ob- 
scure matters, eliminate error from his conclusions, 
and show how his facts are distributed. 
It is universally recognized that all the data 
relating to educational problems are complex; the 
situations out of which they have sprung are compli- 
cated, and in general any factor pertaining to any 
aspect of education is intimately bound up functionally 
with other factors, so that it is not possible to de-
-P-A-G-E-5
  
Editor’s Introduction vii 
scribe the characteristics or measure the force of the 
factor in question unless it can be isolated for pur- 
poses of measurement from the factors with which it 
is ordinarily associated. The untrained student can- 
not accomplish this in treating the problems which 
he wishes to investigate. Even if he can secure data 
by proper modes of procedure, he does not know how 
to organize the data and present conclusions so as to 
reveal their trend and meaning. For this reason it is 
essential that, before attempting investigation, he 
should become familiar with methods of procedure 
that will enable him to avoid error in the treatment 
of his data and to derive principles which the data 
should yield. 
Unfortunately the books that deal with statistical 
method in the treatment of educational data have 
seemed to the novitiate in educational investigation 
to be technical and forbidding. The very appearance 
of most books on statistics has been enough to deter 
the novice from attempting to master this subject. 
The present writer believes that Mr. Thurstone’s 
volume will be more acceptable than the typical text- 
book on statistical method to those who wish to be- 
come familiar with the method so that they can read 
educational literature understandingly and agreeably, 
and so that they may participate according to their 
resources in the investigation of educational prob- 
lems. The author has succeeded in discussing every 
detail of statistical procedure in such a simple and 
clear way and in such terminology that it can be com- 
prehended by a teacher or investigator who has not
-P-A-G-E-6
  Vili Editor’s Introduction 
been able to devote much time and energy to statis- 
tical study. Every essential principle is illustrated 
by concrete, impressive instances. The book might 
be regarded as a primer or introduction to the funda- 
mental principles of statistics. The author has had 
extensive experience in teaching statistical method 
to students in educational psychology. He has made 
himself familiar with the difficulties which novices 
encounter in understanding the logical implications 
of statistics, and he has acquired exceptional skill in 
making these implications clear and intelligible. 
The book may be heartily commended for its sim- 
plicity and clarity to all who wish to contribute to 
educational investigation as well as to those who 
wish to understand the results of investigations 
made by others.

Preface 
Tuts textbook in statistics is the result of seven 
years of teaching the fundamental principles of statis- 
tics and mental measurements to classes of about 
thirty graduate students annually. I have found that 
the majority of the students who enter psychology in 
their graduate work come into it from undergraduate 
majors in economics, literature, languages, psychol- 
ogy, and other unmathematical subjects. They have 
dodged the college course in mathematics, and they sel- 
dom have any occasion to keep fresh their high school 
mathematics. For this reason it has been necessary 
to assume on their part very little knowledge of even 
the fundamentals of high school algebra, but this lack 
is often compensated for by a keen critical ability in 
the logic of the subject. This critical attitude toward 
statistical work I have always tried to encourage, 
and I have discouraged, as far as possible, the blind 
substitution of numbers into formule. It happens 
often that a student learns readily to calculate cor- 
relation coefficients and to draw pretty charts, but 
unless he understands the logical implications of his 
statistical work, more harm than good has been done. 
It has been my aim throughout these lessons to make 
clear the meaning and implications of statistical 
procedures.
-P-A-G-E-8
  x Preface 
I owe to my students much of the form of the 
explanations, since I have included in these lessons 
those particular examples, methods, and teaching 
tricks which have seemed to be most successful in 
explaining the subject to unmathematically inclined 
students. 
I have borrowed extensively from various text- 
books on statistics. The correlation data sheet is a 
modification of Thorndike’s correlation table. I wish 
to acknowledge the use of Figures 30 and 38 and some 
of the related text on percentiles and on the correla- 
tion table from my articles in the Journal of Educa- 
tional Research, for which the publishers have kindly 
given their consent. Ihave adapted Tables r9 and 20 
from the extensive tables prepared by W. F. Sheppard 
and published in “Tables for Statisticians and Bio- 
metricians,” edited by Karl Pearson. The two 
tables are brief, but they should serve the purposes 
of the beginner in statistical work. He will refer to 
Sheppard’s tables for more accurate determinations. 
I hope that this manual may prove useful not only 
to the beginning student in statistics but also to those 
workers in the field of mental measurement who do 
not feel at home in the logical interpretation of their 
statistical work. Many of the outlines and sample 
problems have been so arranged that they should 
prove helpful also for reference purposes. After the 
student has become familiar with the logical aspects 
of the measures of central tendency and variability 
and the meaning of the correlation table, he should 
be able to pursue his statistical studies further in the
-P-A-G-E-9
  Preface xi 
more comprehensive textbooks, such as those of 
Yule, Bowley, Elderton, Brown and Thompson, and 
Kelley. The one outstanding textbook in statistics 
for the student whose training in mathematics is 
limited is that of Yule. It is so exceedingly well done 
that it would be folly for me to attempt anything 
more than an introduction to it. 
Teachers and students who may use this manual 
will confer a favor, for which I shall be grateful, if 
they will call my attention to errors either in the 
text or in the arithmetical work.

Chapter One a 
% The Frequency Table 
When we have a collection of facts in numerical 
form, the first statistical task is usually to classify 
the data in some way. Suppose that a mental test 
has been given to three hundred students and that 
the papers have been scored. Some one inquires 
for the score of Mr. Jones, and we find that his score 
is 79. Is that a high score or a low score? We can- 
not answer that unless we know how many of the 
students scored above 79 and how many of them 
scored below 79. If all the other students scored 
below 79, then Jones’ score is high; but if all the 
other students scored above 79, then Jones’ score is 
low. If 150 of the 300 students scored above 79 and 
150 of them below 79, then Jones has an average or 
ordinary score. This will suffice to show that it is 
not enough to give the test and score the papers; 
we must also classify the scores so that we may know 
how many students’ scored in the nineties, how many 
in the eighties, and so on. Such a table is called a 
frequency table.

  2 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
An intelligence test was given to the freshmen at 
Swarthmore College. In Table 1 we have a list of 
scores. Each number is the score of a student. If 
we want to know how many students obtained scores 
above 79, it is necessary to look through the whole

Table 1. Scores of Swarthmore College freshmen in an intelligence test 
table. That is not necessary when the data are 
arranged in the form of a frequency table, as shown 
in Figure 1. 
The frequency table is prepared as follows: 
1. Arrange a data sheet! with the three headings 
Score, Tabulation, and Frequency, as shown in Fig- 
ure I. 
2. Read off the scores in Table r and for each one 
record a check mark as shown in Figure r. The 
subsequent counting is facilitated if every fifth mark 
is made slanting across the preceding four checks, as 
shown in Figure r. ; 
1A data sheet is a sheet ruled with vertical columns for recording numerical 
or other data. Inrecording facts on a data sheet, be sure to label each column.

4 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
It is now possible to answer such questions as 
these : 
1. How many students obtained scores between 70 
and 79? (21) 
2. How many students obtained scores between 60 
and 69? (12) 
3. How many students obtained scores above 99? 
(55) 4. How many students obtained scores below 70? 
(18) 
5. How many students obtained scores between 
20 and 49? (1) 
6. What per cent of the freshman class obtained 
scores between 80 and 89? (16%) 
7. What per cent of the freshman class obtained 
scores between 40 and 79? (28%) 
8. Isascore of 95 high, average,orlow? (Average) 
9. What per cent of the class exceeded the score 
of 89? (56%) 
All these questions and others of the same kind 
can be answered by referring to the frequency table. 
A variable is any quantity which can have differ- 
ent numerical values. It is any varying quantity. 
Examples of variables are ages, birth- and death- 
rates, prices, wages, barometer readings, rainfall 
records, and city populations. The scores obtained 
in intelligence tests constitute a variable. We may 
consider as a variable the scores made by the different 
persons in a group. We may also consider as a 
variable the scores that a single person makes on the 
same test on different occasions.
-P-A-G-E-21
  The Frequency Table 5 
Variables may be classified as continuous and dis- 
continuous. If it is possible for a variable to change 
its numerical value by infinitesimally small degrees, 
it is called a continuous variable. If this is not 
possible, the variable is called discontinuous. Tem- 
perature, for instance, changes from 68 degrees to a 
new value, such as 69 degrees, by passing through all 
the intermediate values. Therefore temperature is 
considered a continuous variable. The number of 
freight cars in a train is a discontinuous variable 
because this variable does not change by passing 
through all intermediate values. If the train is 68 
cars long, it cannot be made 69 cars long by passing 
through the intermediate values of, let us say, 684 
cars and 68% cars. 
The range is the difference between the maximum 
and minimum values of the variable in any series. 
In this group of Swarthmore freshmen the range of 
intelligence test scores is 107 because this is the 
difference between the highest and lowest scores in 
the freshman class (149 and 42 respectively). 
The class interval is one of the equal parts into 
which a scale is divided for convenience in tabula- 
tion. If we were tabulating the ages of employees, 
we should probably classify them by years. In this 
case the year would be the class interval. If we 
desired a more refined classification, we might classify 
their ages by half-years or by months. This is some- 
times done in classifying the ages of children. If we 
were classifying people by their yearly salaries, we 
might select $100 as a convenient class interval. In’ 
Ct ae
-P-A-G-E-22
  6 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
that case we should classify together all those who 
receive salaries between $1600 and $1699; in the 
next class interval would come all those whose sal- 
aries are between $1700 and $1799; and soon. We 
do likewise in classifying individuals according to 
their mental test scores. In Figure 1 we have used 
ten as a class interval. For example, there are 21 
students in the class interval 70-79. 
The class limits. Let us suppose that a scale 
which runs from o to too has been divided into ten 
class intervals and that the intervals are designated 
as follows: o-10, 10-20, 20-30, and so on. The 
tabulation would be easy except for the multiples of 
ten. In tabulating the number 30, for example, one 
would hesitate as to whether it belonged in the class 
interval 20-30 or in the class interval 30-40. In 
order to avoid this ambiguity in tabulation, it is 
customary to designate the class intervals so that they 
are mutually exclusive and do not overlap. There are 
three common ways of designating class intervals: 
1. The class intervals in the above illustration 
may be designated as follows: 0-9.9; 10-19.9; 
20-29.9; etc. The decimals are carried a little 
farther than the decimals that occur in the data. In 
this case the number 30 would be classified definitely 
in the class 30-39.9 and could not be classified in 
any other interval. 
2. The same class intervals may be designated by 
the midpoint of each interval, thus: 5, 15, 25, 35, 
etc. In this case one tabulates each number in the 
class interval with the nearest midpoint. The num- 
 
-P-A-G-E-23
  The Frequency Table 7 
ber 27 would be classified in the interval of 25 be- 
cause 27 is nearer 25 than 35. This method of tabu- 
lation should be avoided because it does not remove 
the ambiguity in tabulating multiples of 10. 
3. The class intervals may be designated verbally 
as follows: o and less than 10; 10 and less than 20; 
20 and less than 30; etc. This is unambiguous, but it 
is not so convenient on data sheets as the first method. 
The class frequency is the number of cases (individ- 
uals or measures) in a class interval. According to 
Figure 1 there are: 25 students who received scores 
between 100 and tog, inclusive, in an intelligence 
test. The number 25 is therefore the class frequency 
for the class interval 100-109. It should be obvious 
that the sum of all the class frequencies is equal to 
the total number of cases in the table. 
Problem 1. Each number in Table 2 represents the score of 
a freshman at Lafayette College in an intelligence test. There 
are 253 students for whom we have records in this table. 
Prepare a frequency table for these scores similar to the fre- 
quency table in Figure rz. Supply the required information by 
inspecting the frequency table: 
1. How many Lafayette freshmen obtained scores between 
80 and 89, inclusive ? 
2. How many students obtained scores between 110 and 
139, inclusive ? 
3. How many students obtained scores below 70? 
4. What percentage of the Lafayette freshman class obtained 
scores between 80 and 109, inclusive ? 
5. How many students in the Lafayette freshman class 
obtained scores of 110 or better? 
6. What percentage of the freshman class at Lafayette 
obtained scores of 110 or better?

Chapter Two 
The Column Diagram 
When we are reading a report of some kind and 
come upon a page filled with numbers, we are tempted 
to skip them and confine ourselves to the text part 
of the report unless we have a technical interest in 
its detail. Few of us would stop long to examine 
Table r in the preceding chapter because the signifi- 
cance of the data is not easily grasped. The data 
as arranged in the frequency table of Figure z are 
much more intelligible. We can extract information 
from a frequency table more readily than from a 
heterogeneous list of scores. However, the mag- 
nitude of the several frequencies in a frequency table 
does not appear except by close inspection. The 
interpretation of a frequency table is made still 
easier by arranging the table in graphical form, and 
that is what we shall now do. 
In a frequency table it is customary to arrange the 
scale with its class intervals in a vertical column, as 
shown in Figure rz. In plotting a diagram for a 
frequency table this scale should always be arranged 
horizontally, as is shown in Figure 2. At every class 
interval we draw a column, the height of which is 
proportional to the frequencies. The scale for the 
frequencies is at the left of the diagram. For ex- 
ample, we find from the frequency table in Figure 1

that there were 5 students who obtained scores be- 
tween 50 and 59. This fact is also indicated in 
Figure 2 by the 5 vertical units of the column at the 
class interval 50-59. Verify in the same way the 
heights of the other columns in Figure 2 by referring

the frequency table are represented in the column 
diagram of Figure 2, but the column diagram is 
preferable, especially when we want to compare 
several groups. The column diagram is sometimes 
called a histogram. 
 
-P-A-G-E-27
  
The Column Diagram II 
By reference to the column diagram such questions 
as the following may be answered : 
1. Which class interval has the greatest fre- 
quency ? 
2. What is the approximate range? (Why is it 
that the exact range cannot be inferred from the 
column diagram ?) 
3. Which two adjacent class intervals have the 
same frequency ? 
4. Find two adjacent class intervals such that the 
frequency in one is roughly twice that of the other. 
5. What is the frequency in the class interval 
IIO-I19? 
6. How many students received scores between 
go and 109, inclusive? 
The size of the class interval. This is largely a 
matter of convenience in representing the facts. 
In Figure 2 we have used a class interval of 10, to 
correspond with the frequency table in Figure r. If 
we arranged the same data in a column diagram with 
class intervals of 20 instead of 10, we should have a 
diagram like Figure 3. Consider, for example, the 
interval 40-59 in Figure 3. The height of the column 
is 6, which shows that there were 6 students who 
received scores between 40 and 59. Now verify the 
same fact by Figure 2. There we find 1 student in 
the interval 40-49 and 5 students in the interval s0- 
59, or a total of 6 students in the interval 40-59. 
Verify the same fact by reference to the frequency 
table in Figure 1. Compare Figures 2 and 3 in the 
same way with reference to the class interval 60-79. 
 
-P-A-G-E-28
    
12 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
There are two points that should be kept in mind in 
determining the size of the class interval. These are: 
(1) the class interval should be small enough so that 
it will be possible to consider all the individuals in 
one class interval as identical for practical purposes ;

and (2) the interval should be large enough to avoid 
making the frequency table long and laborious to 
handle. In general, a variable can be handled to 
best advantage when its range is divided into from 
15 to 25 class intervals.

The Column Diagram 13 
The column diagram has an interesting property 
of which we shall make considerable use, namely, 
that the area of a column diagram 1s proportional to 
the total number of individuals represented by the dia- 
gram. Determine the area in Figures 2 and 3 and 
verify the fact that both areas are 140, which is the

The frequency polygon is a graph which is very 
similar to the column diagram and which tells the 
same story. It is, however, preferable because it 
shows more clearly than the column diagram the real 
nature of the distribution. There is one fundamental 
assumption in the graphic representation of frequen- 
cies which must be made clear at this point. In the 
column diagram of the preceding chapter we grouped 
the scores in classes. All the scores between 40 and 
50 were grouped in one class, and the number of 
scores in that class was called the class frequency. 
For practical purposes we assume that all the scores 
in the class interval are at the midpoint of the class 
interval; namely, 45. In this way we are consider- 
ing the people who get scores of 41 as equal to those 
who get scores of 49. Both are classified in the same 
class interval and considered as being at its midpoint ; 
namely, 45. They are very nearly equal because the 
scale runs from 0 to 160; and if we divide the scale 
into intervals of 10, we divide the group into 16 
classes, and this division is sufficiently refined for 
practical purposes. The assumption here is that all 
the scores in the same class interval are concentrated 
at the midpoint of the class interval.

Linear Relations 
We shall now discuss the graphic representation 
of the relation between two variables. But we shall 
postpone the consideration of the corresponding 
equations for expressing such relations. 
In Figure 6 is indicated the customary arrangement 
for plotting a chart for two variables. The base line 
is called the axis of abscissas or x-axis. This is the 
axis that we have so far used for the scale of test 
scores. The left vertical margin of the chart is called 
the axis of ordinates or y-axis. This is the axis that 
we have so far been using to designate class frequen- 
cies. The scale on the x-axis is always plotted from 
left to right, as shown in Figure 6. The scale on the 
y-axis is always plotted running up, as shown in the 
diagram. Therefore both the x- and y-scales begin 
at the lower left corner. This point is therefore 
logically called the origin, and it represents zero for 
both scales. 
It is poor form to present a chart without labeling 
both axes. One should also label them so that a 
reader may know what the units of the two axes 
represent, as Temperature in degrees Celsius, Words 
remembered after one hour, Time in seconds, and so on. 
The reader may then extract considerable informa- 
tion from your charts without consulting the text.

20 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
Suppose that you have a long list of numbers and 
that each number is to be divided by a constant, such 
as 17.6. A constant is a number that remains the 
same throughout a series of calculations. Variables 
are the varying quantities. If the list is long, we 
may dodge some of the labor of long division by doing 
it graphically. Let us use ordinary long division 
on four of the numbers and arrange them in a table. 
In this table we have called the given numbers x. 
In the second column we have placed the quotient 
—*_, which we cally. Verify this. 17.6

Now we plot these four points as shown by the four 
small circles in Figure 7. The highest point, for 
example, is above 97 on the x-axis and directly 
opposite 5.51 on the y-axis. Verify the position of 
the other three points and compare these positions 
with the table above. The important fact is that 
these four points lie in a straight line. We draw the 
straight line through the four points, as shown. 
Now we can find the quotients for the other num- 
bers by inspection and save ourselves the labor of 
long division. For example, as is 4.43. To get 
this we find 78 on. the x-axis and run up to the 
line, where we find 4.43, which is therefore the

answer. The third figure is only approximate when 
we are using graphical methods. With a little prac- 
tice one gains facility in reading charts of this kind.

dividing 25, 39, and 87 by the constant 17.6. What we

Let us plot the relation between inches and centi- 
meters. In order to translate from one to the other, 
we use the formula: 
Tin: = 2.54 cm,
-P-A-G-E-38
  2D The Fundamentals of Statistics 
Tabulating a few sample comparisons at random, we 
have the following table : 
y z 
IN. ou. 
5 12.7 
20 50.8 
50 127. 
70 177-8 
Plotting these, we have the four points in Figure 8. 
These points lie in a straight line. Using the chart, 
we may say at a glance how many centimeters there 
are in 20 in., 36 in., 44.5 in., and soon. In the last 
illustration, 44.5 in., it is necessary to interpolate 
between the horizontal lines for 44 in. and 45 in. 
Facility in interpolating on charts is also readily 
acquired with a little practice. In the same way we 
may determine from the same chart how many inches 
there are in a given number of centimeters. Verify 
by inspecting the chart the fact that there are 39 
inches in 100 centimeters. 
It is highly essential that the student realize that 
in plotting lines on cross section paper he is not 
merely drawing lines on paper. Diagrams like Figures 
7 and 8 tell a story much more effectively and com- 
pletely than whole chapters of text. It is highly 
essential that the student of statistics acquire the 
ability tosee the meaning of a chart. There is probably 
not a single statistical idea which cannot be thought of 
more effectively in graphical form than in words. The 
student should constantly attempt to visualize sta- 
tistical operations until this becomes a habit in think- 
ing about any quantitative relations. By this I do
-P-A-G-E-39
  
Linear Relations 28 
not mean mental arithmetic and visualizing numbers 
as such, but rather the lines and distances that repre- 
sent them. Let me illustrate by a commonexample. 
If one is asked to find the square of .30, he probably 
thinks “ nine hundred ” as the answer, and then he 
thinks again, ‘‘ Four decimals make .o9.” But we

Figure 8. Graph for translating units of measurement 
may not be sure that we are correct without counting 
the decimals with paper and pencil. Mental work 
of this kind is easier if one proceeds like this: Think 
of unity as a vertical line of any convenient height, 
in which .30 is about one-third of the line. The 
square of .30 is about one-third of .30, which is
-P-A-G-E-40
  24 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
approximately .10. In this way the reasonableness 
of calculating is made more apparent than by depend- 
ing entirely on arithmetical operations. The square 
of .65 must be in the vicinity of .43 or .44 because 
.65 is about 3 of unity, thought of as a unit distance. 
Two-thirds of .65 is somewhere in the vicinity of .44 
because one-third of .65 is approximately .22.. Num- 
bers should be thought of as distances or other spatial 
magnitudes. It is more essential that the student 
learn to think of lines on charts, frequency polygons, 
and other graphic representations as alive, as actually 
moving to fit the facts, than to learn the arithmetical 
operations in statistics, no matter how blindly and 
conscientiously they are performed. 
When it is necessary to deal with negative numbers 
on either or both of the two axes, the codrdinates of 
Figure 6 are extended as shown in Figure 9. If we 
compare Figure 6 and Figure 9, we find that Figure 
6 is the upper right quarter of Figure 9. It takes 
care of positive numbers in both x and y and it is 
called the first quadrant, as shown in Figure 9. The 
other quadrants are added in order to make it pos- 
sible to represent negative values on either or both of 
the axes. 
The x-axis in Figure 9 has a scale running from left 
to right, beginning with the lowest negative number 
on the axis. The y-axis runs up, beginning at the 
lowest negative number, as shown. The origin for 
a chart of this kind is at the center, as indicated. 
The origin is the intersection of the two zero-axes. 
We shall now use the four quadrants for showing

the relation between two temperature scales, the 
Fahrenheit and the Celsius, or centigrade. By means 
of the chart we shall be able to tell at a glance what

The relations that we have just been plotting are 
all indicated by straight lines on the cross section 
paper. Such relations are called linear relations. 
 
-P-A-G-E-43
  Linear Relations 27 
The straight line for a linear relation may or may not 
pass through the origin. If two variables, x and y, can 
both be zero at the same time, then the line passes 
through the origin. If the line does not pass through 
the origin, we can safely infer that when one of the 
variables is zero, the other cannot simultaneously 
be zero. 
There are two other terms in connection with 
curve plotting which are useful. The reading on the 
x-axis at the point where a line or curve crosses the 
axis is called the x-intercept. In Figure ro the x-inter- 
cept is 32. It can be thought of as the value of x 
when y iso. In Figure ro the interpretation of the 
x-intercept (32°) is that this is the temperature on the 
Fahrenheit scale when the Celsius scale reads zero. 
In the same way we define the y-intercept as the read- 
ing on the y-axis when x is zero. In Figure ro the 
y-intercept is approximately —18 degrees. It is the 
Celsius temperature when the Fahrenheit tempera- 
ture reads zero.

Non-Linear Relations 
We shall now discuss the construction and inter- 
pretation of charts in which the several points for 
sample observations fall in a curve instead of in a 
straight line. Such relations are called non-linear. 
As a matter of fact, it is customary to refer to this 
subject as curve-plotting even when the lines are 
straight. It is even customary to speak of a straight 
line on a chart as a curve, the word “curve” being 
then used to mean any kind of line on a chart. 
Let us plot the relation: between the side of a 
square and its area. First we tabulate a few sample 
observations like this:

We plot the four points as indicated by the four 
small circles in Figure rz. The curve must pass 
through the origin because the square of zero is zero. 
This gives an additional point in plotting the curve. 
It is obvious that a curve is more accurate, the greater 
the number of points plotted. The points in Figure 
iz do not fall on a straight line, but in a curve. We

find 6.8 on the x-axis and then run up to the curve, 
which we cross at the level of 46 on the y-axis. This 
is as it should be because 46 is approximately the 
square of 6.8. One can also determine the square 
root of a number by a chart of this kind. For ex-

we cross at 8.8. This figure is approximately the 
square root of 78. A chart does not yield as accurate 
answers as does the arithmetical procedure. The chief 
advantage with the chart is that it shows the nature 
of the functional relation between the variables that

one is studying. In most scientific work that is much 
more important than decimal places. 
In Figure 12 we have another illustration of a rela- 
tion that is non-linear. It shows how money grows 
at compound interest. The x-axis is time in years, 
and the y-axis is the total value of principal and 
accrued interest. The curve was plotted to show the 
increase of $100 when drawing interest at the rate of 
5%, compounded annually. The chart shows, for 
example, that after 10 years the $100 have increased 
to alittle over $160. One can also determine approx- 
imately how long the principal must draw the speci- 
fied interest in order to reach a stated amount. Thus 
it will have doubled in a little over 14 years. 
These facts can be obtained more accurately from 
an interest table, but the chart shows something that 
the interest table does not make quite so conspicuous. 
The chart shows that not only does the total amount 
increase but also that the rate of increase increases. 
The gain for the first 4 years is about $20, whereas 
the gain from 16 to 20 years is over $40. The 
curve not only rises but it rises more and more 
rapidly with time. This is the nature of the func- 
tion, and such facts are not so conspicuous from a 
table of numbers. 
Figure 13 should be studied in detail because it in- 
volves two fundamental points. It shows the progress 
of one person in the so-called mirror-drawing experi- 
ment, which is universally used in studying learning in 
psychological laboratories. The experiment consists 
in having the subject trace with a stylus the outline  
-P-A-G-E-50
  34 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
of a six-cornered star, guided only by the reverse 
image of the star as seen in a mirror. This was 
repeated forty-two times in the experiment plotted 
in Figure 13. The first trials consumed more time 
than the subsequent trials. In fact, the subject’s 
progress in learning the trick is measured by the time

Each trial is indicated by a small circle. For ex- 
ample, the first trial consumed 49 seconds, as shown 
by the chart; the fifth trial required 20 seconds; the 
thirtieth trial required only 10 seconds.

  Non-Linear Relations 35 
When all the records have been plotted in the form 
of small circles, we may complete the chart in one of 
two ways. (1) We may join all the points by short 
straight lines, as we did in plotting the frequency 
polygon. That is sometimes done. (2) We may 
draw a smooth curve to represent the general prog- 
ress of the subject in learning mirror drawing. 
The location of a point on the chart is determined 
partly by the stage of proficiency attained by the 
subject and partly by many minor factors, such as 
distractions, amount of effort, state of fatigue, and 
soon. What we are interested in is a curve to show 
the relation between two variables ; namely, practice 
as measured by the number of trials, and proficiency 
as measured by the time required to trace the out- 
line. If we draw a smooth curve so that there are 
approximately as many points above the line as 
there are points below the line, we shall have a repre- 
sentation of progress as determined by practice. 
Such a smoothed curve will be relatively free from 
the minor disturbances of particular days. The 
smoothed curve in Figure 13 was drawn by inspec- 
tion. 
There is a fundamental difference between the 
data of the social sciences and the data of the exact 
sciences as far as statistical treatment is concerned. 
This difference lies in the fact that in the social 
sciences Our measures are not so refined as in the 
exact sciences. They are not relatively so free from 
chance disturbances as are observations in the exact 
sciences. For this reason we are compelled to dis-
-P-A-G-E-52
  36 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
cover trends and relations that may exist in spite of 
the many social chance disturbances over which we 
have no control. This is why we must establish 
tendencies by smoothing the curves so as to ignore 
the irrelevant factors. Practically all correlation 
statistics are based on the clear recognition of the 
fact that in the social sciences we are dealing with 
tendencies that may be discovered in spite of dis- 
turbing and irrelevant factors. 
Having now plotted a curve to show the general 
relation between two variables, let us interpret this 
relation by inspecting the chart. It is at once 
apparent that the curve runs higher at the left side 
of the chart than on the right side. This means that 
the earlier trials in the mirror-drawing experiment 
require more time than the later trials, and that is 
reasonable because with practice one can reduce the 
time required to trace the star outline as seen in the 
mirror. Another fact which is apparent in the chart, 
but which does not appear so readily in the tables of 
raw data, is that the reduction of time in the first 
ten trials is greater than the time reduction in the 
last ten trials. More specifically, the subject re- 
duced the time in the first ten trials from 49 seconds 
to 17 seconds, or a total time reduction of 32 seconds. 
In the ten trials from the 30th to the 4oth the subject 
reduced his time by only 1 second. This is an ex- 
ample of the law of diminishing returns. Continued 
practice at almost anything yields improvement, but 
the first few hours of practice give more improvement 
than the last few hours. A relation of this kind is
-P-A-G-E-53
  Non-Linear Relations 37 
seen in a chart at a glance, but it is not so readily 
seen in a table of numbers. 
A learning curve like the one in Figure 13 shows 
that the subject has not attained ultimate perfection 
in forty-two trials, and the chances are that he could 
never become so perfect that he would not show 
improvement with additional practice. This is in- 
dicated by the fact that the curve is still falling some- 
what even after 42 trials. In order to ascertain how 
fast the subject could do the mirror drawing if the 
mirror codrdination were completely mastered, he 
was asked to trace the outline, looking straight at 
it without the mirror interference. This required 
about seven seconds. It is reasonable to suppose 
therefore that, if he continued practicing indefinitely 
at mirror drawing, he would ultimately be able to 
trace the outline almost as fast with the mirror as 
without it; namely, in seven seconds. The heavy 
line at seven seconds may be considered a limit to- 
ward which the learning curve is approaching but 
which it will probably never quite reach. Such a 
straight line, indicating a limit toward which a curve 
is approaching but which it does not reach until 
the x- or y-variable becomes infinitely large, is called 
an asymptote. 
Problem 1. Prepare a table of data for the x- and y-variables 
in Figure 13 so that the table represents the observations in the 
laboratory from which the figure was charted. 
Problem 2. The following table! enables one to determine

corresponds to a given score in the Army Beta examination. 
However, in using the table it is sometimes necessary to inter- 
polate for scores between the steps in the table. This is not 
necessary inachart. Plot a chart showing the relation between 
these two variables and smooth the curve slightly if necessary.

Smoothing the Frequency Polygon 
When a frequency polygon is plotted with a limited 
number of cases, the outline of the polygon is usually 
irregular. As the number of cases represented by 
the polygon increases, the polygon becomes smoother 
and shows more truly the real nature of the distribu- 
tion. When a frequency polygon has been plotted, 
it is often desirable to smooth it so as to show what 
the polygon would be like with a larger number of 
cases. We cannot of course be absolutely certain 
that a smoothed polygon is exactly what it would be 
with a large number of cases, but we are quite sure 
that a smoothed polygon is more nearly like the 
polygon for a large number of cases than the irregular 
outline of a polygon for a limited sampling. 
The chance deviation of a point on the frequency 
polygon above or below the true value may be in- 
ferred partly from the adjacent points. If a point 
on the polygon is below the points on either side, we 
may infer perhaps that its frequency is by some 
chance effect too low. If we inspect Figure 5 for 
such irregularities, we find that the frequency of 25 
in the class interval 100-110 seems abruptly too 
high, or it may be that the frequency of 23 in the 
adjacent class interval go-100 is too low. If we 
gave the same mental test to the same class a second

time, we probably should not find the peak at 1oo— 
110, as in Figure 5. It is probably a chance fluctua- 
tion. In smoothing the frequency polygon we are 
trying to ascertain the shape which it would take if 
it represented conditions freed from minor accidental 
fluctuations. There are several slightly different 
methods of smoothing polygons. We shall use one

as far as possible. 
In order to balance the frequency of 45 at D, we 
join the adjacent frequencies by a straight line, CE,
-P-A-G-E-59
  Smoothing the Frequency Polygon 43 
which intersects the vertical through D at the point 
J. We locate by inspection the midpoint, K, of the 
line DJ. The balanced frequency for the class in- 
terval 80-89 is therefore 41. In the same way we 
locate the point G, which gives 30 as the balanced 
frequency for the class interval of 60-69, and con- 
tinue likewise for the other points on the diagram. 
We then draw a smooth curve as nearly as possible 
through the balanced frequencies, as shown in Fig- 
ure 15. 
If we draw a smooth curve through the balanced 
frequencies or through the actually observed fre- 
quencies, such a line is called a frequency curve. 
The smoothed curves in Figures 15 and 16 are called 
frequency curves, whereas if the frequencies were joined 
by straight lines, the outline would be called a fre- 
quency polygon. 
In locating the balanced frequencies, one need not 
split hairs about the measurements. In fact one can 
safely draw the construction lines free-hand with a 
little practice. It is not necessary to go to consci- 
entious extremes in smoothing a frequency polygon 
because the procedure is, even at best, an approxima- 
tion of the outline that would be obtained with a 
larger number of cases. 
In Figure 16 we have transferred from Figure 15 
two things, namely, the frequency curve and the 
originally observed frequencies as indicated by the 
small circles. Figure 16 shows the manner in which 
a frequency curve should be presented in a report. 
It is quite permissible, of course, to present a fre-  
-P-A-G-E-60
  44 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
quency polygon in a report, and even the more awk- 
ward column diagram is occasionally used. 
If a frequency curve is used in a report, be sure to 
show by small circles the actually observed frequencies 
of the original data so that the reader may use his own 
judgment as to the extent to which the original data have 
been smoothed. This is accomplished in Figure 16. 
The small circles show the original data, and the 
curve shows the author’s interpretation of the nature 
of the distribution of which the data are a sample. 
This is a fundamental point to keep in mind in all 
curve plotting: the small circles show the actual 
observations, while the curve is an interpretation of 
the observations. 
The arithmetical equivalent of the graphical pro- 
cedure that we have just been discussing is as follows : 
In order to smooth the frequency of 35 at the point 
C in Figure 15, we add twice the frequency at C 
(2 X 35 = 70) and the adjacent frequencies (37 + 
45). This gives a total of 152, which we divide by 4 
to get the balanced frequency of 38. These balanced 
frequencies should preferably not be tabulated because 
they might give the reader of a report the impression 
that they are observed frequencies, which they are not. 
Another method of smoothing a frequency polygon 
is to increase the size of the class interval. When the 
size of the class interval is increased, there are natu- 
rally more cases in each interval, and that tends to 
smooth the effect of the minor fluctuations. This 
effect is seen more clearly when a frequency table is 
plotted with class intervals of varying size.

experimentally that increasing the size of the class interval 
makes the outline of the frequency polygon smoother and more 
continuous, and that the outline shows fewer zigzags. 
Why is it that the three polygons are not of the same size

Graphical Tabulation 
A frequency table is usually a means to an end. 
It is ordinarily a step in the preparation of a graph 
such as the frequency polygon. One can occasion- 
ally save considerable time in preparing a frequency 
polygon from raw data by plotting the original 
readings directly on the chart, thus eliminating the 
frequency table entirely. In Figure 17 we have 
tabulated the data of Table x and Figure r directly, 
without the intermediate use of the corresponding 
frequency table. It is done as follows: 
Read the numbers in the raw data, one at a time, 
and for each number place a dot above the appro- 
priate x-value. The first number in Table 1 is 62. 
Place a dot on the first line above 62. Never place 
these dots on the x-axis because it always represents 
zero frequency. The next number is 123. Place 
a dot on the first line immediately above 123 on the 
x-scale. Later in the series of numbers, 62 occurs 
again. When it is read off, we plot its dot on the 
second line above 62 because there already is a dot 
plotted on the first line above 62. When the whole 
list of numbers has been read off, we have the dots 
plotted as in Figure r7. We can now tell at a glance 
that there are five scores of 82 in the list, four scores 
of 102, none at 97, one at 96, and similarly for 
47
-P-A-G-E-64
  48 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
other scores. The horizontal cross rulings enable 
one to read these frequencies directly, without count- 
ing the dots. In practice it is not necessary to make 
the dots as large as in Figure 17. In fact, pencil dots 
are sufficiently conspicuous on cross section paper 
unless it is printed in black. &

Figure 17. Graphical tabulation 
When the dots have all been plotted, one should 
count them and check their number with the number 
of cases in the original data. The next step is to 
select a suitable class interval. Figure 17 has been 
completed with a class interval of ten. The fre- 
quency scale for the polygon need not be the same 
as for the dots. To determine the frequency in any 
class interval, one simply counts the dots in that  
-P-A-G-E-65
    Graphical Tabulation 49 
interval. In Figure 17 we count 25 dots for the 
interval 100-109. This class frequency is indicated 
by the small circle at an elevation of 25 over the 
midpoint for the class interval 100-109; and simi- 
larly for the other circles which are joined by straight 
lines to complete the frequency polygon. 
A distinct advantage of this method of plotting is 
that one can readily replot the polygon with a differ- 
ent class interval if that is found desirable. This 
can be done without returning to the raw data. In 
plotting the dots one must be careful to keep his 
place in the table if he is interrupted.

The Equation of a Straight Line 
through the Origin 
Almost every scientific investigation involves the 
discovery or study of the relationship between two 
or more variables. The relationship may be stated 
in different ways when quantitative relations are 
involved. 
1. The relationship between two variables may 
be stated verbally. If we are studying the relation 
between the Fahrenheit and Celsius thermometers, 
we may describe this relation verbally as follows: 
“The Celsius thermometer reads zero degrees when 
water freezes, and it reads 100 degrees when water 
boils. The Fahrenheit thermometer reads 32 degrees 
when water freezes and 212 degrees when water boils. 
There is a constant ratio between a Celsius degree 
and a Fahrenheit degree.” If we read 58 degrees on 
a Celsius thermometer and wish to translate this 
reading into a Fahrenheit scale, it is inconvenient to 
do so from this verbal description of the relation. 
2. We may plot a graph for the relation as in 
Figure 18, in which the verbal description guided us 
in locating two points. These two points are con- 
nected by a straight line. Now, if we read 58 degrees 
on a Celsius thermometer and wish to translate it 
si
-P-A-G-E-68
Celsius Scale 52 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
into the Fahrenheit scale, we can readily do so by the 
chart. The corresponding Fahrenheit reading, as 
read off directly from Figure 18, is 137 degrees. The 
graph is in this case much more effective as a method 
of describing the relation between these two variables.

3. Another way to show the relation between two 
variables is by an equation. The equation for the 
relation between the two temperature scales is as 
follows : 
C = 55 F — 17.7, 
in which C is the Celsius reading and F is the cor- 
responding Fahrenheit reading. The derivation of

The Equation of a Straight Line 53 
equations will be discussed shortly. If we read 58 
degrees on the Celsius scale and wish to translate 
into the corresponding Fahrenheit scale, we simply 
substitute 58 for C in the above equation and solve 
for F thus: 
C = .55 F — 17.7 
584+17.7 = .55F 
58+17.7 =F 
“55   
Pom age te 
We see, then, that the equation and the graph both 
tell the same story, but in different symbols. The 
graph can be read more quickly ; the equation takes 
less space and is more accurate. 
We shall consider first the equation of a straight 
line which passes through the origin. Its general 
form is 
y = ax, 
in which a is called the multiplying constant. In 
Figure 19 we have charted seven equations of this 
kind. Notice, for example, the line for the equation 
y =x. This equation simply says that y is always 
equal to x, and that condition is true for any point 
on the line marked with this equation. When 
x =+ 5, for example, then y =+ 5. The point 
(« =+ 5, y =+ 5) ison the line. The same condi- 
tion is true for the extension of this line into the 
third quadrant. 
Consider in the same way the line which is marked 
with the equation y = .25 x. When x = 6, then

y = 1.5, according to the equation, and the point 
(x = 6, y = 1.5) is found on the line. In the same 
way one may easily verify to his own satisfaction 
the fact that each of the lines in Figure ro tells the 
same story as the corresponding equation. Substi-

paired will in each case be found on the line, or on an 
extension of the line if the chart were made larger. 
The location of the lines in Figure ro is determined 
by the multiplying constant, for that is the only way 
in which these equations differ. The multiplying
-P-A-G-E-71
  The Equation of a Straight Line 55 
constant is commonly known as the slope of the line. 
This is an appropriate name, for the greater the 
numerical value of this constant, the steeper is the 
line. Compare the three lines with the slopes of 
3, 1, and .25. It is readily seen that the line with a 
slope of 3 is steeper than the line with a slope of only 
.25. The same observation about the slope can be 
made for the two lines in Figure ro that are drawn 
through the origin into the second and fourth quad- 
rants. In these two lines the two variables x and y 
are opposite in sign. 
The equation of the axis of abscissas or x-axis is 
y = 0, because on that line y is always 0. Similarly 
the axis of ordinates or y-axis has as its equation 
x = 0, because on that line all values of x are o. 
A line which satisfies an equation is called the locus 
of that equation. Every pair of x- and y-values that 
is satisfied by the equation can also be represented 
by a point which is somewhere on the locus of the 
equation. A pair of x- and y-values is said to be 
satisfied by an equation when the two members of 
the equation are equal with the x- and y-values sub- 
stituted in them. 
We have seen that a line can be plotted for a given 
equation. One can also determine the equation for 
a given line. If the line goes through the origin at 
0, one can determine the corresponding equation by 
determining the slope of the line. That is done as 
follows: Sketch any right-angled triangle, as 4 BC, 
with the given line as hypotenuse (the long side of a 
right-angled triangle). Then one leg, AC, of the tri-
-P-A-G-E-72
  56 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
angle will be parallel to the x-axis. This triangle 
may be sketched anywhere along the line and may be 
of any convenient size. Measure BC and AC. The 
slope of the line is the ratio ae The distance BC 
is 1.5 and the distance AC is 6, as measured on the ; 
x- and y-scales. The ratio is therefore 4:2 or 255 6 
which is the slope of the line. 
In order to increase the accuracy with which the 
slope is determined, it is best to make the triangle as 
large as possible. We could increase the size of the 
triangle by using the triangle DBE for our measure- 
ments. The slope is then a = 43 or .25, as be- 
fore. 
We have now seen (1) that a line on a chart may be 
represented by an equation; (2) that an equation of 
the form y = ax can always be represented by a 
straight line passing through the origin with a slope, 
or steepness, which is determined by the multiplying 
constant a; and (3) that an equation of the form 
y = ax can be written for any line on a chart when 
the line passes through the origin. The graph and 
the equation are two ways of telling the same story.

for one of the variables, solve for the other variable, and locate 
the point on the chart. Show that in each case the point so 
located falls on the appropriate locus.

Chapter Nine 
The General Equation of a Straight Line 
We shall now consider the general form of equation 
to describe any straight line on a chart. The general 
form is 
y= ax +), 
in which a and D are constants while x and y are the 
two variables. We have previously seen that the 
constant a is called the multiplying constant and 
that it determines the slope or steepness of the line. 
The constant b is called the additive constant, and it 
determines where the line cuts the y-axis. In Fig- 
ure 20 we have five straight lines with their appropri- 
ate equations. Notice that all these lines are paral- 
lel. That could also be shown, before plotting the 
lines, by the fact that the multiplying constant, or 
slope a, is the same for all of them; namely, + .5. 
Next notice that the additive constants are different. 
In fact, the additive constant is in each case equal to 
the y-intercept. The line with the equation y = .5 x 
+ 4 has as its additive constant + 4 and this agrees 
with the fact that the y-intercept for that line is + 4. 
Verify similarly the agreement between the additive 
constant and the y-intercept by examining the other 
lines in Figure 20. 
By examining Figure 20 we also discover that when 
the additive constant is positive, the line crosses the 
58

  The General Equation of a Straight Line 59 
y-axis above the origin, and that when this constant 
is negative, the line crosses the y-axis below the origin. 
When the line passes through the origin, the additive 
constant is zero, and the equation then takes the 
simpler form described in the previous chapter, as is

In Figure 21 we have drawn several straight lines 
at random. We shall now determine their equations 
by inspection of the chart. Consider first the line 4. 
The general form of the equation for a straight line 
is y = ax +b. We must ascertain the numerical
-P-A-G-E-76
  60 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
value of each of the two constants in the equation in 
order to be able to use the equation. The additive 
constant } is simply the y-intercept. We find this 
on the chart at the point F, which reads + 2 on the 
y-scale. Hence the constant b is +2. The slope

a is determined as shown in the previous lesson. It 
is the ratio pals as read from the appropriate x- and 
y-scales; namely, a or .37. The constant a is 
therefore .37. We can now write the equation of the 
line 4 thus: 
yr 37K +2 
 
-P-A-G-E-77
  
The General Equation of a Straight Line © 61 
It is well to remember that when the line slopes 
down to the left, the slope is positive, and that when 
it slopes down to the right, it is negative. When the 
line is horizontal, as is the line M, the slope is zero 
and the x-term vanishes. The equation of the line M 
is therefore y = ox + borsimply y = b. The value 
of the additive constant b is again the y-intercept, 
and this is read directly from the chart as — 2. 
Hence the equation of the line M is y =— 2. This 
means that the value of y in the line M is always — 2, 
which is readily seen to be true by inspecting the 
chart. 
Referring to the equation for the line 4, we may 
easily verify it by noting some point on the line, such 
as the point indicated by the small circle. Its 
codrdinates are (wv =+ 8, y =+ 5). Substitute 
these values in the equation for line 4 thus: 
Y= 37% +2 
5 =. .37.X%8-+ 2 
5 = 2.96 +2 
The two members of the equation are as nearly equal 
as can be determined from a chart. If we do likewise 
with any point on the chart which is not on the line 4, 
we discover that the two members of the equation are 
not equal. 
The equation of the line £ is written x =— 4, 
which is another way of saying that the value of x 
for all points on the line E is — 4. Inspection of 
line E, Figure 21, shows that this is actually the 
case.
-P-A-G-E-78
  62 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
We may determine in the same manner the equa- 
tion for the line D. Its y-intercept is — 2, and 
therefore the constant b is — 2. The slope of the 
line D is found, as before, by the ratio of the two legs 
of any right-angled triangle against the line, such as 
IJK. The ratio here is 43 which (Sarl or 
— 1.33. The slope is therefore — 1.33, and the 
equation of the line D is 
ye eo ahaa 
This equation can be verified, as before, by assuming 
any value whatever for x, such as — 3. Substituting 
this value in the equation and solving for y, we find 
that + 2 is the corresponding y-value. Locate this 
point, (x =— 3,y =+ 2), on the chart and note that 
it falls right on the line D. In designating a point on 
a chart by its two codrdinates, it is customary to 
write the x-value first and the y-value second. This 
makes it superfluous always to specify them as x and 
y. Thus the point (« =— 3, y =+ 2) would ordi- 
narily be designated simply (— 3, + 2). 
In the same manner verify the fact that the equa- 
tion of the line C is y =— .6x +3. Keep in mind 
that the sign of a constant in an equation is an essen- 
tial part of it. The student should form the habit of 
visualizing an equation of a straight line by noting 
two facts about each equation ; namely, its slope and 
the y-intercept. It is sometimes useful to note that 
the ratio of the y-intercept to the x-intercept is equal 
to the slope.
-P-A-G-E-79
  The General Equation of a Straight Line 63 
We have discussed the methods of writing an equa- 
tion for a given straight line. One can also plot a 
straight line on a graph to represent any equation 
which can be written in the form y = ax +b. In 
order to do this, simply assume two or three values 
for either variable and find by the equation the cor- 
responding values of the other variable. Plot these 
points on a graph and join the points by a straight 
line. While only two points are necessary to locate 
a straight line, it is well in practice to plot at least 
three points in order to insure as far as possible 
against arithmetical error. 
Occasionally we meet with an equation which at 
first sight does not look like the equation of a straight 
line, but which can readily be handled as such. We 
shall consider a few of these. The equation 
) = 20 +3 + 2 
can readily be seen to be the equation of a straight 
line if we combine the two additive terms into one 
term, so that the equation becomes y = 2x + 5. 
Another example is 4y = 8x + 6, which is the 
equation of a straight line and can be plotted by 
the methods that we have just described if we 
write it in the form y = 2x +1.5. The equation 
3% = 8 —4y +2 «is also the equation of a straight 
line. We must express it, however, in such a way 
that the term in y is one member of the equation and 
the additive term and the term in x are the other 
member. When s0 stated, it is said to be written 
explicitly in terms of y. This is done as follows :
-P-A-G-E-80
  64 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
3x =8 -—-4y+2% 
a= 85 49, 
4y =-x+8 
yore (25 xe + 2 
In the last form the equation is similar to the general 
form of equation for any straight line, in which the 
slope is — .25 and the y-intercept is + 2. 
Summary. The principles of the last two chapters 
may be summarized as follows : 
1. Every straight line on a chart can be repre- 
sented by an equation in the general form y = ax 
caus 
2. The slope or steepness of the line is indicated 
by the multiplying constant a. It is positive when 
the line slopes down to the left. It is negative when 
the line slopes down to the right. It is zero for all 
horizontal lines. It can be determined graphically 
by the ratio of the y-intercept to the x-intercept or 
by the legs of any other similar triangle on the chart. 
The measurements are always with reference to the 
x- and y-scales and not with reference to the rulings 
on the cross section paper that one happens to be 
using. 
3. The additive constant indicates the y-intercept. 
It is positive if the line crosses the y-axis above the 
origin. It is negative if the line crosses the y-axis 
below the origin. 
4. If two straight-line equations have the same 
multiplying constant, their loci must be parallel. If 
they have the same additive constant, they both 
cross the y-axis at the same point.

  Chapter Ten 
The Arithmetic Mean 
If you had given an intelligence test to two classes 
and wished to determine which of the two classes was 
in general the brighter, you would probably calculate 
an ordinary average for each class. The class with 
the higher average would, in general, be the brighter 
class. The average is determined by adding all the 
scores and dividing the sum by the number of scores 
in the class. The quotient is the average. Stated 
more clearly and conveniently, we have 
m= 28, 
n 
in which m is the average of the scores, 2S is the sum 
of all the scores, and m is the number of individuals 
in the group. This ordinary average is known in 
statistics as the arithmetic mean in order to distin- 
guish it from other kinds of average; for there are 
several of them. 
If we stopped to consider just what it is that we 
are doing when we calculate an average, we should 
conclude that we are trying to find a single number 
to represent a whole series of numbers, a single score 
to represent a long list of scores. It often happens 
that the average is a number which is different from 
any of the single numbers in the list that it represents. 
67
-P-A-G-E-84
68 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
For example, if we had scores of 2, 4, 6, and 8 in a 
small group of four, the average would be 5. This 
we should use as a single number to represent all four 
of the scores, even though the average, 5, is not 
represented in the original data. 
Whenever a single number is used to represent a 
series of numbers, that number is called the central 
tendency of the series. The term is perhaps self- 
explanatory. The central tendency is a single num- 
ber, or point on a scale, which is as far as possible the 
most representative of the series. It is usually a 
number somewhere in the central part of the range of 
the series. The arithmetic mean, or ordinary aver- 
age, is the most generally used of all the measures of 
central tendency. We shall now consider four ways 
of calculating it. These differ only in detailed ar- 
rangement. Since they give practically the same 
average, the choice among them is simply a matter 
of preference as determined by the available calcu- 
lating machines, the length of the series, the absolute 
size of the numbers, and the manner in which they 
happen to be classified. The arithmetic mean is the 
most commonly used mean and is usually referred to 
simply as the mean. There are other kinds of mean, 
such as the harmonic mean and the geometric mean, 
but these may be specified when necessary. 
Calculation of the mean without tabulation. Table 
Tis a list of scores of students in a mental test. The 
mean score for that class can be figured perhaps most 
simply by adding all the scores on an adding machine. 
Divide the sum, 12,990, by 140, which is the number
-P-A-G-E-85
  The Arithmetic Mean 69 
of scores in the table. This gives a quotient of 
92.785, which is the mean score. The student of 
statistics should learn to dodge arithmetical work, 
especially mental arithmetic, wherever machines are 
available for the drudgery. This leaves one’s mind 
free to formulate the problem, which the machines 
cannot do. 
Stated in convenient notation, 
=X 
n   
2 
in which m is the mean, X is any one of the numbers 
in the series, {X is the sum of all the X numbers, 
and n is the number of cases. The symbol = will 
occur repeatedly in subsequent work and should be 
clearly understood. It is not a separate quantity. 
It should be read “the sum of” what follows. 
Hence 2X means the sum of all the X numbers. 
The above formula is therefore interpreted, “ the 
mean is equal to the sum of all the X numbers divided 
by the number of cases.” 
Calculation of the mean from a frequency table. 
When the scores have been arranged in the form of a 
frequency table, as in Table 4, it is much more con- 
venient to use the table for calculating the mean. 
One thereby saves the trouble of reading each of the 
original numbers. The procedure is to prepare a 
data sheet with headings as shown. In the first 
column are listed the class intervals. In the second 
column are listed the frequencies. In the third 
column we have the midpoints of the class intervals.
-P-A-G-E-86
  70 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
In the fourth column we enter the products of the 
items in the second and third columns. The mean 
is then determined by the relation 
Te ee 
in which m is the mean, =fX, is the sum of the 
products in the fourth column, and 7 is the number of 
cases. It should be clearly understood that =f/X,, is 
the same as =X. This sometimes causes confusion 
in the minds of students. The notation {X, means 
the sum of all the X numbers in one class interval.

It is the midpoint of the class interval multiplied by 
the number of cases in the interval. Hence =fX,, 
means the sum of all the X numbers in all the class 
intervals. But that is what 2X means also. The 
use of the notation =fX instead of X on data sheets 
is simply to make clear which columns are to be
-P-A-G-E-87
  The Arithmetic Mean 71 
multiplied, since the heading X is used also to desig- 
nate the column which contains only the X-scale. 
The mean, as determined by this method, is 93.64, 
which is practically the same as the absolute mean of 
92.78, as previously figured for the same data. 
Calculation of the mean by an equivalent scale. 
The products in the fourth column of Table 4 are 
rather large, especially if it should be necessary to 
work with them without the aid of calculating ma- 
chines. If the same result could be obtained with 
calculations involving smaller numbers, it would be an 
advantage. It happens quite frequently in statistical 
work that one can substitute a so-called equivalent 
scale, with smaller numbers than those of the original 
data, performing the calculations on this equivalent 
scale, and then applying a correction to the result in 
order to translate the equivalent scale back to the 
original data. Such a procedure sometimes saves 
considerable labor. We shall now calculate the 
mean of the same series of measures by the use of an 
equivalent scale (Table 5) so as to reduce the size of 
the numbers involved in the computations. 
The mean expressed in terms of the equivalent 
scale, instead of the X-scale, is 
But we want this mean in terms of the original X- 
scale. This is accomplished by the relation 
m = 10m, + 45 
48.64 + 45 = 93.64
-P-A-G-E-88
72 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
This transformation from the equivalent scale to 
the original X-scale involves two points of difference 
between the two scales. Inspection of the third and 
fourth columns of Table 5 will show that the steps of 
the equivalent scale are very small compared with 
those of the midpoints, and that the equivalent 
scale begins with zero whereas the scale of midpoints 
begins with 45. Hence the above relation in chang- 
ing from one to the other. The equivalent scale is 
of advantage only when the calculations involve 
large numbers which must be handled without calcu- 
lating machines.

  The Arithmetic Mean 73 
Calculation of the mean by an arbitrary origin. 
This is one of the most frequently used methods of 
calculating the mean, and it is also the method used 
for the mean in connection with correlation work, 
which will be discussed later. In using the equiva- 
lent scale we reduced the size of the numbers in the 
computation. This can be reduced still further by 
placing the zero of the equivalent scale somewhere in 
the middle range of the scale. The point on the X- 
scale at which we place the zero of the equivalent 
scale is called the arbitrary origin or the assumed 
origin. It can be placed anywhere at random, as far 
as accuracy of results is concerned, but it is most 
advantageously placed in the middle range of the 
X-scale because this reduces to a minimum the size of 
the numbers with which we deal in the computations. 
In Table 6 we have the detailed steps in the calcu- 
lation of the mean by the method of an arbitrary 
origin. These data are identical with those of the 
two preceding calculations in this lesson. The com- 
putation is made as shown on the following page. 
The first column in Table 6 contains the X-scale 
arranged in class intervals, for convenience in tabu- 
lation. The second column contains the frequencies. 
In the third column we list an equivalent scale. 
This is done by first locating the assumed origin, zero, 
at one class interval somewhere in the middle range 
of the X-scale. It is advantageous to select the class 
interval to be designated as the assumed origin so 
that one has approximately as many cases in the f 
column above the assumed origin as there are cases
-P-A-G-E-90
  
74 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
belowit. This estimate need only be a rough one and 
is not essential to the arithmetical accuracy of the 
results. The steps of the equivalent scale are num- 
bered consecutively + 1, + 2, + 3, etc. for the class 
intervals of the X-scale which represent numbers 
numerically higher than the assumed origin. The 
class intervals in the other direction are numbered 
consecutively on the equivalent scale — 1, — 2, — 3, 
etc. In Table 6 we have placed the assumed origin 
at 95, which is the midpoint of the class interval 
go-99. The class interval 100-109 is numerically 
the next higher and is therefore numbered + 1 on the 
equivalent scale. The class interval 80-89 is numer- 
ically the next lower one and is therefore numbered 
— 1 on the equivalent scale.

The Arithmetic Mean 75 
The fourth column contains the products f£, 1.2., 
the products of the second and third columns, as 
shown. The sum of the positive f£ products, 2fE pos5 
is + 107. The sum of the negative f£ products, 
ZfE ees is — 126. The number of cases, 7, is the sum 
of the f-column. 
The next step is to calculate =f, which is simply 
the algebraic sum of ZfZ,,, and 2fEy,g. In the ex- 
ample the sum 2fE£ is — 19. This enables us to cal- 
culate the correction, c, by the relation 
pee 
n c 
in which c = correction. It is the difference be- 
tween the true mean, m, and the assumed origin, m,. 
n = the number of cases. 
I =the number of X-scale units in each class 
interval. It is ro in the illustration. 
When the correction, c, has been determined, we 
find the true mean by the relation 
m=mt+e. 
In actually doing the computations for the sample 
problem at the end of this chapter it will be best to 
avoid this text matter and simply follow the three 
outlines in Tables 4, 5, and 6. These outlines are 
self-explanatory and should serve as a guide in com- 
putation without the text. 
Before proceeding to calculate the mean by these 
various arithmetical procedures, it is well to stop 
and consider some of the properties of the arithmetic

76 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
mean. Suppose that a column diagram were plotted 
on heavy cardboard, or other substantial material, 
and that we cut the cardboard along its outlines. If 
we did this for the data we have been considering, we 
should have a piece of cardboard similar in appear- 
ance to the heavy outline in Figure 2. Now suppose 
further that we balance this piece of cardboard on a 
knife edge which is kept perpendicular to the base 
line. If we shifted the cardboard until it balanced, 
we should find that it would balance exactly at the 
absolute mean as determined in Table 6. This is a 
useful concept of the mean or ordinary average. It 
explains perhaps better than formule just what is 
meant by the mean. 
All individuals are represented in the cardboard by 
equal rectangles. The width of each rectangle is the 
distance representing a class interval. The height of 
each such rectangle is the distance representing a 
frequency of one. We should keep in mind the fact 
that one individual located relatively far away from 
the knife edge causes the mean to “ weigh ” more, as 
it were, on that side of the knife edge. The tendency 
of each individual, as he is represented by a small 
rectangle in the column diagram, to overbalance the 
card on his side of the knife edge is called the moment 
of that individual. The moment is, strictly speak- 
ing, the product of the area or mass and its distance 
from the knife edge. Since all the small rectangles 
in the column diagram are equal, it is clear that the 
moment for any individual is determined solely by 
his distance from the mean. For this reason an

The Arithmetic Mean 77 
individual who is located at either extreme of the 
range has automatically more vote, as it were, in 
determining the mean. The individual who is right 
at the mean is entirely neutral. The practical point 
here involved is that a very few cases at high X-values 
or at low X-values affect the mean of the whole 
series very markedly, whereas a few changes in the 
frequencies of the class intervals near the mean do 
not noticeably affect the mean. 
When a mean has been calculated, it is well to 
glance at the X-scale to see that the mean as calcu- 
lated looks reasonable, 7.¢., that it falls somewhere in 
the central range. If the mean as calculated falls 
outside the range, there is an arithmetical error some- 
where. 
Problem 1. Refer to Table 3. Calculate the mean for the 
data in the table by the four methods outlined in this chapter.

  Chapter Eleven 
The Median 
The median is another measure of central tendency. 
It is defined as the middle number in a series of num- 
bers when these have been arranged in their order of : 
magnitude. The median score is the point on the 
X-scale so selected that there are as many scores above 
the median as there are scores below it. This condi- 
tion is not true for the mean. Under some conditions 
the median is a better measure of central tendency 
than the mean. 
Consider, for example, the following series : 
Trev Ae OPE 25 S07. Te 22 eT ko 
Arranging these in the order of their magnitude, we 
have: 
Nee ahee O) IT oh ay pene 
The median is 11 because it is the middle number 
when the numbers have been arranged in order of 
magnitude. There are four numbers in this series 
higher than the median, and there are four numbers 
below it. The mean is 10.7. 
The above example has an odd number of cases. 
When the series has an even number of cases, the 
median is the number which is halfway between the 
two middle numbers. This satisfies the definition of 
the median.

The two middle numbers are to and 11. The median 
is halfway. between them, at 10.5. _ The mean is 14.8. 
When the data are arranged in the form of a fre- 
quency table, it is advisable to calculate the median 
as shown in Table 7. The data of that table are 
identical with those of Figure r.

Table 7. Calculation of the median 
The following steps indicate the method of calcu- 
lating the median : 
1. The first two columns are identical with those 
of previous frequency tables. 
2. The third column contains the accumulated 
frequencies. For any ¢lass interval, such as 70-79, 
 
-P-A-G-E-96
  80 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
the third column entry represents the sum of all the 
frequencies for this and the lower class intervals, 
1é.,.1 +5 +124 21 = 39. 
3. Ascertain the number of cases; in this case, 
140. Determine * which in the illustration is 70. 
4. Find the class interval which contains . the 
median. It is the class interval which, in the column 
of accumulated frequencies, contains “. In the illus- 2 
tration it is the interval go-99. 
5. Divide the class frequency of this interval into 
two parts, a and 3b, such that the accumulated fre- 
quency of the next lower interval plus a will be . In 
the illustration this is 62 + 8 = 70. Hence a = 8; 
and since a + b = 23, b must be 15, as shown. 
6. Let the number of X-scale units in each class 
interval be designated 7. Then the median is the 
sum of the X-scale value at the lower edge of the in- 
terval which contains the median, plus J ¢ in which 
f is the frequency of that interval. 
The calculation is very short and simple and is 
perhaps more readily understood by examining the 
computation at the bottom of Table 7 than by the 
text. : 
In Figure 23 we have illustrated further the calcu- 
lation of the median. The median is somewhere in 
the interval go-99. There are 23 cases in this inter- 
val. We assume that these 23 cases are distributed

uniformly through this interval. The median is the 
point on the X-scale so located that there are as many 
cases above it as there are cases below it. Starting 
at the bottom of the X-scale, we count off 70 scores 
and then note where we are on the X-scale. That 
point is the median. When we have counted 6 cases, 
we are at 60 on the X-scale. When we have counted 
39 cases, we are at 80 on the X-scale. When we have 
counted 62 cases, we are at 90 on the scale. If we 
continued to 100 on the scale, we should pass 85 
cases whereas we want to pass only 70; hence the 
median is somewhere in the class interval 90-99. 
When we have counted the desired 70 cases, we 
have passed 8 out of the 23 cases in the interval 
go-99. We assume that these 23 cases are uniformly 
distributed in the interval. Hence we go beyond the 
point 90 a distance equal to 38 of the next interval. 
There are to scale units in each interval. Hence we 
add a to go in order to locate the median on the 
X-scale. The same reasoning can be followed by 
beginning at the top of the scale and counting down 
instead of up. Both procedures give the same me- 
dian, as shown by the two sample computations in 
Figure 23. 
It is of some interest to note that if on a column 
diagram we draw a vertical line through the median, 
we thereby divide the diagram into two equal areas. 
Problem 1. Calculate the median for the data of Table 2. 
Check the median by calculating it from both the upper and the 
lower ends of the range.
-P-A-G-E-99
Chapter Twelve 
The Mode 
The mode is a third measure of central tendency. 
It is simply the X-value at which the frequency curve 
is highest. When the data are arranged in the form 
of class intervals, with a class frequency specified for 
each interval, we assume the mode to be the midpoint 
of the class interval with the highest frequency. 
This assumption is roughly correct and serves the 
purpose in most cases. The mode therefore requires 
no calculating unless one cares to determine it by 
smoothing a frequency curve. This, however, is not 
ordinarily done. 
We shall summarize briefly the definitions and 
properties of the three forms of central tendency. 
The mean is the ordinary average. It is the sum 
of the scores in a series divided by the number of 
scores in that series. Ifa column diagram is plotted 
on cardboard and cut along the base line and along 
its outline, the diagram will balance on a knife edge 
placed at the mean. 
The median is the middle score in a series of scores 
after the scores have been arranged in order from 
lowest to highest. The median score is such that 
there are as many scores above it as there are scores 
belowit. Sometimes a novice gets the impression that 
the median is the middle of the range, but that is only 
rarely true and it is not a definition of the median. 
83
-P-A-G-E-100
  84. The Fundamentals of Statistics 
The mode is the scale value at which the frequency 
curve is highest. It is the X-value at which the fre- 
quency curve has the highest ordinate. When the 
data are arranged in a column diagram, the mode is 
assumed to be at the midpoint of the class interval 
with the highest frequency. 
It is well to remember that every measure of central 
tendency is a point on the X-scale. It sometimes 
happens that two or more factors influence the shape 
of a frequency curve so that the curve has two or 
more peaks. When a frequency curve has two peaks 
and when both of these are thought to be caused by 
factors other than chance, the curve is said to be 
bi-modal. ‘To determine whether a curve is signifi- 
cantly bi-modal or whether the apparent bi- 
modality is simply caused by chance fluctuation in 
the class frequencies is largely a matter of statistical 
judgment. 
When a frequency curve is asymmetrical, as in 
Figure 24, the curve is said to be skewed. When the 
frequencies in the class intervals on either side of the 
mode are well balanced, the curve is said to be sym- 
metrical. The curve may be symmetrical without 
being normal. Inspection of the two curves in 
Figure 24 shows that in curve 4 the right side has a 
longer sweep than the left side. In curve B we have 
the opposite condition. In order to differentiate 
them, we call these two kinds of skewness positive 
and negative. In curve 4 the long sweep is on the 
right side of the mode, toward the upper end of the 
X-scale, and it is therefore said to be skewed positively.
-P-A-G-E-101
  The Mode 85 
Curve B by the same kind of reasoning is said to be 
skewed negatively. 
The three forms of central tendency fall at the same 
point on the X-scale if the distribution is symmetrical. 
If the frequency curve is skewed, the three forms of

central tendency will fall at different points on the 
X-scale. We see here the reason for using several 
forms of central tendency. They become important 
when dealing with skewed surfaces. 
Problem 1. Determine the mean, median, and mode for each 
of the two curves in Figure 24. Plot them on a chart and draw . 
your own conclusions as to the manner in which these three 
forms of central tendency arrange themselves for skewed surfaces.

the properties of the several forms of central tendency.

Chapter Thirteen 
Variability 
We shall now consider another fundamental con- 
cept in statistics. We have seen that the central 
tendency is a point on the scale which represents as 
well as possible the whole distribution. There are 
several measures of central tendency, and we have 
considered the three most commonly used; namely, 
the mean, the median, and the mode. If we desire to 
describe a distribution briefly, we specify its central 
tendency. For example, if we are dealing with the 
salaries of a group of men, we can give some idea of 
these salaries by saying that their central tendency, 
as expressed by the mean, is $3000. When we hear 
such a statement, we assume that some of the salaries 
are a little larger than $3000, that some of them are 
smaller, and that the average of all the salaries in the 
group is $3000. But, in order that a brief statement 
of the distribution shall be at all complete, it is nec- 
essary to state in addition how far the salaries scatter 
above and below the mean. For this purpose we 
state some measure of variability. In fact, a meas- 
ure of variability shows how far the numbers of a 
series scatter on either side of the central tendency. 
If we are told the central tendency of a series of meas- 
ures, and also to what extent the numbers scatter 
above and below the central tendency, we have in 
86
-P-A-G-E-103
Variability 87 
these two facts a pretty fair idea of the size and dis- 
tribution of the numbers. We are now concerned 
with the several methods of stating the variability of 
a series of numbers. In this and following chapters 
we shall consider four methods; namely, 
1. The range 
2. The mean deviation 
3. The quartile deviation or semi-interquartile 
range 
4. The standard deviation 
The range. Let us compare two short series of 
numbers as to their central tendency and variability. 
a. 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 4g 
b. 21 22 23 24. 25 26 27 28 29 
The mean of each series is 25 ; hence they are iden- 
tical as far as the central tendency is concerned. The 
numbers in the first series scatter more than those of 
the second series. This is indicated by the fact that 
the range of the first series is 45 — 5 = 40, whereas 
the range of the second series is only 29 — 21 = 8. 
The range is one measure of variability. If we 
wished to describe these two series of numbers with- 
out enumerating them in detail, we could convey the 
information as follows: 
Centra TENDENCY VARIABILITY 
Series a. Mean = 25 Range = 40 
Series b. Mean = 25 Range = 8 
A glance at these two facts about each series conveys 
a fair idea about them. We can see by the central 
tendency and variability of the two series that a num- 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
  88 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
ber like 30 is above the average in each series, that it 
is relatively near the mean of series a, and that it is 
relatively very high in series D. 
There is a serious practical limitation in the use of 
the range as a measure of variability which has made 
it imperative to use other measures for this attribute. 
The range is an unstable measure because it depends 
only on the two extreme cases, the highest and the 
lowest. If the series a and b represented mental test 
scores, the range for the whole group would depend 
on the two end cases only. The range is not affected 
by the variability of measures between the two ex- 
tremes, as may be seen in the following illustration : 
Ge 5 22, 23 24 25 26 27 28 45 
Series c has the same range as series a, but its num- 
bers do not scatter any more than those of series b, 
with the exception of the two isolated end cases. 
The mean deviation. Let us consider another 
series of numbers such as this: 
x, the series .

Zd= 40 Mean of d = 3.08 
We have listed on the first line a series of numbers 
from 4 to 20, with a range of 16 and a mean of 12. 
On the second line we have listed the deviation of 
each number from the mean of the series, disregard- 
ing sign. Thus 15 has a deviation of 3 from the 
mean, which is 12; 20 has a deviation of 8; 9 has a
-P-A-G-E-105
  
Variability 89 
deviation of 3; and 12 has a deviation of o. The 
sum >x = 156, and from this we get the mean, as 
= _ 12. The sum 2d = 40, in which d represents ta 
deviation from the mean, and from this we. get the 
mean deviation, as 2d 3.08. The mean deviation n 
is simply the average of all the deviations, disregard- 
ing sign. If the mean deviation of a series of num- 
bers is large, it shows that the numbers in the series 
scatter about the mean more than if the mean devia- 
tion were small. 
The mean deviation can be calculated from any 
measure of central tendency, such as the mean or 
median. Hence one should always specify from which 
measure of central tendency a mean deviation has been 
calculated. In the above illustrations we have calcu- 
lated the mean deviation from the mean of the series. 
When a mean deviation is to be calculated for a 
series of numbers arranged in class intervals, we can 
arrange the calculation as shown in Table 8. 
1. Tabulate the class intervals, the midpoints of 
the class. intervals, and the frequencies in the first 
three columns, as in previous problems. 
2. Add the frequency column to determine the 
number of cases, 7. 
3. Tabulate the fx products in the next column. 
4. Add the fx column to determine 3fx. 
5. Calculate the mean from the relation 
Mean = Zp n

6. Tabulate in the next column the deviations, d, 
of the midpoints from the mean. 
7. Tabulate the fd products. 
8. Add the fd column to determine fd. 
g. Calculate the mean deviation from the relation 
xfd oa Mean deviation = 
These calculations can be done to best advantage 
on calculating machines. If one must calculate a 
mean deviation for a large number of cases without 
the use of a calculating machine, the labor can be 
reduced by arranging an equivalent scale, as shown 
previously for the calculation of the mean. 
We have seen previously that a measure of central 
tendency is a point on the scale. It should now be 
seen that a measure of variability is a distance meas- 
ured in terms of the scale units.

The Quartiles 
As measures of variability we have so far discussed 
the range and the mean deviation. We shall now 
describe another measure of variability which is even 
more generally used, namely, the quartile deviation or 
semi-interquartile range. When we are examining a 
frequency distribution with special reference to its 
degree of scatter about the central tendency, the 
quickest way to ascertain it is to notice the range. 
If the range is large, the numbers scatter considerably 
on either side of the central tendency. The variabil- 
ity is then said to be great. We have called attention 
to .the inadequacy of the range as a measure of 
variability, in that it is completely determined only 
by the two extreme cases, the highest and the lowest. 
Anything which causes a fluctuation in either or both 
of these extreme cases causes a fluctuation in the 
measure of variability of the whole distribution. 
In Figure 26 we have a column diagram of 68 cases. 
The median is at the point 11 because one-half of the 
area, 34 cases, is above the point 11 and one-half of 
the area is below it. The range for the diagram in 
Figure 26is 19. Instead of using this as a measure of 
variability, we shall determine the range which shows 
the scatter of the middle half of the group, 7.¢., the 
middle 34 cases. For this purpose we count one- 
fourth of the area, 17 cases, up from the median and

locate the upper quartile, which is universally desig- 
nated Q;. The upper quartile in Figure 26 is at the 
point 13 on the X-scale. Similarly we count one- 
a fourth of the area, 17 cases, down from the median 
) 6 to locate the lower quartile at 8. It is universally 
designated Q,. The median is sometimes, but not 
often, referred to by the notation Qp. ne

ci We have now divided the column diagram into 
four equal parts; namely, o — 8, 8 — 11, II — 13, 
13 —19. Each of these four parts contains 17 cases. 
The middle half of the numbers is between the lower 
quartile, Q,, which is at the point 8, and the upper 
quartile, Q;, which is at the point 13. This distance 
of 5 X-scale units between Q, and Q; is called the 
quartile range. It is a measure of variability which 
is quite generally used, easy to determine, and quite  
-P-A-G-E-111
The Quartiles 95 
stable as compared with the total range, which is 
unstable and unreliable. The quartile range is de- 
termined by all the measures and is therefore not 
so quickly affected by small fluctuations in one or 
two single numbers. ; 
The range from the median to the lowest measure is 
11. The range from the median to the highest meas- 
ureis19 — 110r8. Therefore the diagram is skewed 
low or negatively. This is also indicated by the fact 
that the lower quartile range (Median — Q,) is 
greater than the upper quartile range (Q; — Median). 
A study of the location of the quartiles shows not 
only the variability or scatter of the numbers but also 
the relative degree of skewness and its direction. 
Instead of using the quartile range as a measure of 
variability, it is quite common to specify the variabil- 
ity of a distribution by the quartile deviation, which 
is simply one-half of the quartile range. The quar- 
tile deviation of Figure 26 is 2.5. The quartile devia- 
tion is sometimes called the semi-interquartile range. 
If the distribution is symmetrical, not skewed, the 
upper and lower quartile ranges are identical; Q; and 
Q; are then equally distant from the median, and the 
median is in that case at the center of the total range. 
In such distributions the upper quartile range, the 
lower quartile range, and the quartile deviation are 
all identical. 
We shall now calculate the quartile constants for 
another frequency distribution. The diagram in 
Figure 26 was intentionally drawn so as to avoid 
decimals because they might confuse the explanation
-P-A-G-E-112
96 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
of the quartiles. In practice the quartiles rarely fall 
at even integers, as in Figure 26. The method of 
calculating the quartile points is similar to the 
method previously described for the median. In 
fact, the median can be considered as one of the three 
quartile points which divide the distribution into 
four equal parts. 
Procedure in calculating quartiles. Arrange a 
data sheet as shown in Figure 27. In the first column 
tabulate the class intervals. In the second column 
tabulate the class frequencies. Add the frequency 
column to obtain the total number of cases, 7, which 
in the illustration is 143. Divide this by 4, which 
gives 35.75 cases in each quartile in the illustration. 
Locate the class intervals which contain the three 
quartile points. This is done by counting 35.75 from 
either end for one quartile; 2 X 35.75, or 71.50 
cases, for the median; and 3 X 35.75, or 107.25, 
cases for the other quartile. 
When the class intervals containing the three quar- 
tile points have been located, divide the class frequen- 
cies in these class intervals so that the distribution is 
divided into four equal parts, as shown by the 
brackets in Figure 27. 
Then locate the quartile point in the class interval, 
as shown by the calculations in Figure 27. These 
calculations are based on the assumption that the 
cases within a class interval are distributed uniformly 
through the interval. Thus the upper quartile point 
must be close to the upper end of the class interval 
100-109 because its frequency, 25, is split so that

  98 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
only 4.25 cases belong to the top quarter while the 
remaining 20.25 cases belong to the next lower 
quarter. We therefore place the upper quartile 
point oe of the distance of a class interval from the 
top of that interval. Hence we get: 
Upper quartile = 110 — #75 200 =110 —1.9 = 108.1 
The other quartile points are located by the same 
kind of reasoning. 
Having located the three quartile points, we deter- 
mine the quartile constants directly from their defini- 
tions, as shown in the following calculations: 
Quartile range = Q; — Q; = 108.1 — 78.0 = 30.1 
Quartile deviation, or semi-interquartile range, 
Upper quartile range = Q; —Q, = 108.1—93.5 =14.6 
Lower quartile range = Q, —Q, = 93.5 — 78.0= 15.5 
We might summarize the properties of quartiles as 
follows : 
1. The three quartile points divide the distribu- 
tion into four equal parts. Each quartile has the 
same number of cases; namely, one-fourth of the 
total distribution. The four areas of the column dia- 
gram marked off by the three quartile points are 
equal. See Figure 26. 
2. If all the numbers of the distribution were 
written on separate slips of paper and thrown into a 
hat, the chances would be even that any number
-P-A-G-E-115
The Quartiles 99 
drawn from the hat would fall between the upper and 
lower quartiles. This is reasonable because one-half 
of the numbers are between the upper and lower 
quartile points while the other half of the numbers 
are above or below these points. 
3. Any one of the quartile constants gives a fair 
idea of the degree of scatter or concentration of the 
numbers about the central tendency. 
Problem 1. The following table shows the frequency dis- 
tributions of two groups of people in an intelligence test. These 
groups are designated 4 and B. Calculate for each group the 
median, upper quartile range, lower quartile range, and quartile 
deviation, and make a comparison of the two groups of people 
on the basis of these constants. Plot both distributions in the 
form of frequency polygons on the same chart and indicate on 
it the quartile constants.

Chapter Fifteen 
The Standard Deviation 
We shall now discuss one of the most generally 
used measures of variability; namely, the standard 
deviation. We have already seen that the mean 
deviation is the mean of all the deviations, disregard- 
ing sign. The standard deviation is of the same order 
of magnitude. It differs from the mean deviation 
simply in this: the deviations are squared before 
being summed ; this sum is divided by the number of 
cases, as with the mean deviation; and out of this 
quotient we extract the square root, in order to ob- 
tain the standard deviation. This last step is neces- 
sary, from one point of view, in order to reduce the 
measure of variability to the same order of magnitude 
as the original deviations. 
The standard deviation is universally symbolized 
by the notation o (sigma), and it is expressed more 
briefly this way: 
vas 
een V7, 
in which d represents deviations from the mean of the 
series, and =d? represents the sum of the squares of 
all deviations. The advantage of the standard devi- 
ation is that it can be handled algebraically better 
than the other measures of variability.

  The Standard Deviation IOI 
In Figure 28 we have a frequency curve, with its 
mean at 100 and a standard deviation of 30. This 
means that about two-thirds of the cases are located 
between 70 and 130. The standard deviation is a 
distance, as all measures of variability must be. In 
Figure 28 we have plotted both the original X-scale 
and the corresponding sigmas. The number 70 can

IIs is +.¢ +; 40 is — 20; and so on. 
As has p.cviousty been pointed out, we are usually 
interested in two fundamental facts about a fre- 
quency distribution — the central tendency, which 
is a point on the X-scale, and the variability, which 
is a distance on the X-scale. The central tend- 
ency shows the general location of the numbers on 
the X-scale, z.¢., it shows whether a list of salaries 
ranges around $100 or $200 per month. The variabil-
-P-A-G-E-118
102 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
ity shows how far the salaries scatter or how closely 
they concentrate about the central tendency. If a 
single case is considered, such as the number 160 in 
the distribution of Figure 28, we should specify both 
the central tendency and the variability of the dis- 
tribution, in order to have a fair idea as to where the 
number 160 stands in relation to its fellows. Both 
of these facts are combined, as regards a single num- 
ber, 160, by designating it + 20. The fact that this 
notation is positive shows that the number is above 
the average, and the fact that it is 2 o shows that it is 
far above the average of the distribution. The total 
range of a symmetrical distribution represents about 
six sigma, three positive and three negative. The- 
oretically, the distribution extends to infinity above 
and below the mean, but over 99 % of the cases in a 
symmetrical surface are included between the limits 
+3oaand —3<4. 
When two frequency curves are compared as to 
their variability by means of the standard deviation, 
a large standard deviation indicates a greater varia- 
bility than a small standard deviation. The proper- 
ties of the standard deviation will be discussed more in 
detail in connection with the normal frequency curve. 
The standard deviation is used so extensively in 
statistical work that several methods have been 
devised for calculating it. We shall describe three 
of these methods : 
1. Without class intervals 
2. With class intervals and an arbitrary origin 
3. In terms of the original numbers
-P-A-G-E-119
  The Standard Deviation 103 
The choice of the method of calculation depends on 
one’s individual preferences, the available calculating 
machines, and the arrangement of the given data. 
1. Calculation of standard deviation without class 
intervals. In Table 9 is illustrated the simplest pro- 
cedure for calculating the standard deviation without 
any short cuts. In the first column are numbered 
all the observations or scores. There are 29 cases in

this illustration. In the second column are listed 
the numbers themselves in whatever order they may 
occur in the original data. The sum of the second 
column is 2X, which is in this case 166. This sum, 
xX = 166, is divided by the number of cases, 
n = 29, which gives the mean, 5.7. In the third 
column are recorded the deviations from this mean, 
disregarding sign. In the fourth column are listed 
the squares of the individual deviations. The sum 
of this column is 2a? = 147.81. The remaining sub- 
stitutions in the formula for the standard deviation 
are shown in Table 9. This method of calculating 
the standard deviation becomes unwieldy with a 
large number of cases and with relatively large 
numbers. 
2. Calculation of standard deviation with class 
intervals and arbitrary origin. In Table ro is illus- 
trated another method of calculating the standard 
deviation. It is perhaps more generally used than 
any other method. In the first column are listed 
the class intervals, so defined as to avoid ambiguity 
in classification. In the second column we list the 
corresponding class frequencies. The sum of the 
f column is the number of cases, 7, which in this 
illustration is 140. 
The next step is to assume an arbitrary origin 
somewhere in the middle range of the distribution. 
That class interval is chosen ‘as the arbitrary origin 
and labeled zero which is nearest the mean, as far as 
this can be guessed by inspection. The arbitrary 
origin can be located anywhere on the scale, even
-P-A-G-E-121
  
    
The Standard Deviation 105 
outside the range, without in any way affecting the 
arithmetical accuracy of the calculation, but the 
numbers involved in the calculation are made the 
smallest possible by locating the arbitrary origin at 
or near the mean. This facilitates the arithmetical 
work. In the illustration of Table ro we have called 
the class-interval go-99 zero and labeled it zero in 
the d column. The other spaces in the d column are 
labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. in both directions from the zero 
class interval. The deviations are therefore calcu- 
lated in terms of class intervals and not in terms of 
the original scale units. The class intervals higher

than the zero interval are designated as positive 
deviations, and the intervals lower than the zero 
class interval are designated as negative deviations, 
as shown in the d column of Table ro. 
The fd column contains the products of the f and d 
columns. The sum of the negative items in the fd 
column is =fdye, which in the illustration is —126. 
The sum of the positive items in the fd column is 
Xfdyos, Which is 107 in the illustration. The difference 
between these two items is 2fd, which in the illustra- 
tion is —19. 
In the fd? column we have the products of the d and 
fd columns. The sum of this column is 2fd?, which 
is 589 in the illustration. 
The correction, c, is necessary on account of the 
use of an arbitrary or guessed origin during the calcu- 
lations. It is determined and used as shown in 
Table ro. 
The standard deviation in this illustration is 2.04 
class intervals, but we must note that each class 
interval contains ten scale units, as is seen by the 
column of class intervals. Therefore, the standard 
deviation is 2.04 class intervals or 20.4 scale units. 
8. Calculation of standard deviation in terms of 
the original numbers. In Table 11 we have a method 
of calculating the standard deviation in terms of the 
original numbers, so as to avoid dealing with devia- 
tions and correction for the arbitrary origin. This 
method seems simple at first, but it is labor-saving 
only when the numbers dealt with are relatively 
small. Even in that case one must be careful to

carry the calculations to a sufficient number of sig- 
nificant digits to insure reasonable accuracy in ob- 
taining a relatively small difference between two rela- 
tively large numbers under the radical of this formula.

Their sum is 1098. The remaining calculations are 
shown in Table r1. 
In general, the second method of calculating the 
standard deviation involves the least amount of labor. 
The formula for the standard deviation used in the 
third method gives the same result as the formule 
used for the first two methods. The identity can 
be shown as follows : 
The deviation, d, of any particular number, X, 
from the mean, m, of the series is

Percentile Ranks 
It is sometimes desirable to state the relative stand- 
ing of an individual with reference to the other mem- 
bers of a group. This is usually done by giving him 
a rank. Thus, if there are seventeen persons in a 
group, the person who ranks highest is given a rank 
of seventeen and the person whose rank is lowest is 
given a rank of one. 
If we are told that a person has a rank of 27, we 
do not know whether his rank is high, average, or 
low, unless we also know the number of individuals 
in the group. Ifa person ranks 27 in a group of 29, 
he ranks high relative to the group. If he ranks 
27 in a group of 1,000, his rank is relatively low. 
When designating an individual by his absolute rank, 
one must also state the number of individuals in the 
group with which he is compared. The absolute 
rank of an individual member of a group is his numer- 
ical position when the ranks of all the members of 
_ the group have been arranged in order from the 
lowest to the highest. The highest numerical rank 
is given to the person who ranks highest. In this 
sense the designation of absolute ranks differs from 
the customary expression of calling the best person 
“first.” In statistical language ‘“‘one” means the 
109 
   
-P-A-G-E-126
  110 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
lowest numerical score, no matter what the meaning 
of the score may be. 
In order to avoid the necessity of stating the num- 
ber of cases involved in designating a person’s rela- 
tive position by rank, one may express the absolute 
rank in terms of percentile rank. In this case one 
states the rank that the person would have if there 
were one hundred members in the group. If there 
are fifty individuals in a group, the middle person 
would have an absolute rank of 25, but his percentile 
rank would be 50. A percentile rank is so calcu- 
lated that it indicates the per cent of the group which 
ranks below the specified percentile. A person who 
has a percentile rank of 72 exceeds 72 per cent of the 
group and is exceeded by 28 per cent of the group. 
The median score is always the soth-percentile. 
The upper quartile is always the 75th-percentile, and 
the lower quartile is always the 25th-percentile. 
When several individuals have the same score, a 
certain assumption is made concerning their ranks. 
Consider the ten individuals designated by the fol- 
lowing scores : 
indwaiduals As 2B °C Deh PF Gene oie 
Score: $5.24 2g 3G AT: 56 eG OR Pee 
These scores are arranged from the lowest to the 
highest. Now if we designate these individuals and - 
their scores by absolute ranks, we have the following 
arrangement: 
Individual : Gs Bee Ce D's Heo, ~-G' a. Hs alee ay

  Percentile Ranks III 
But B and C have the same score, and consequently 
they should have the same rank in order to state 
fairly their relative position in the group with which 
they are compared. This is done by assigning to 
each of these two persons the same rank; namely, 
their median rank. The revised statement of abso- 
lute ranks is then as follows : 
Individual : A Bes Cia oR Garr elena): 
Score: EO: 24) 24.95. AL. 56: 56 56 7k Oe 
Absolute Rank: 1 24 Bh a RF OR OF oe 
In this case B and C, who have the same score, 24, 
are given the same absolute rank, namely, 23; and 
the three individuals, F, G, and H, who have the 
same score, 56, are given the same absolute rank, 
namely, 7. The total number of ranks assigned is 
ten because there are ten individuals in the group. 
No individual is given the rank of 6 or 8, these being 
skipped in order to balance the ranks for the small 
groups of equal scores. 
The same assumption is made concerning percen- 
tile ranks. Suppose that one hundred individuals are 
ranked from the lowest to the highest and that the 
twenty highest individuals all have the same score. 
It would be unfair to assign a percentile of 81 to one 
of these twenty persons and a percentile of 100 to 
another when both have the highest possible score. 
In cases of this sort all twenty are given the same 
percentile rank, namely, 90, which is the median per- 
centile rank of the twenty individuals who have the 
same score at the top of the group. The same as- 
sumption is made for groups of identical scores in the
-P-A-G-E-128
112 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
middle range of the distribution and at the lower end. 
As a consequence it is possible to assign percentile 
ranks in such a way that no individual gets a per- 
centile of 100 even though several of them have the 
highest possible score. 
In the accompanying table, Table 12, we have the 
calculation of the percentile ranks for the Liberal 
Arts freshmen at the University of Texas in an in- 
telligence test. The first two columns indicate the 
class intervals, two columns being used to specify the 
lower and upper limits of each class interval. The 
third column gives the midpoint of the class interval. 
The fourth column gives the frequencies. The sum 
of the frequency column is of course the total number 
of cases, 7, which in this illustration happens to be 
860. 
The next step is to label the three percentile col- 
umns, the lower percentile, the upper percentile, and 
the midpercentile, respectively. This is done be- 
cause the percentile rank which belongs to the bottom 
of a class interval is not the same as that which be- 
longs to the upper edge of that class interval. The 
midpercentile between these two is assigned as the 
percentile rank for the whole class interval. The 
failure to take this bit of logic into consideration 
accounts for many inconsistencies in the calculation 
of percentile ranks. 
The first step in the actual calculation is to determine 
the rate, which ts the reciprocal of the total number of 
cases. In the illustration of the accompanying 
example, the total number of cases is 860, which is 7.  
-P-A-G-E-129

The rate is % or —— = , which is .o01162. This can be 
determined ike by performing the indicated divi- 
sion or directly from Barlow’s Tables or any other 
similar tables.

Table 12. Calculation of percentile ranks 
Every class interval represents a percentile range. 
In the fifth column we have the lower limit and in the 
sixth column the upper limit of the percentile range 
for each class interval. The upper limit of the per- 
centile range for any given class interval is identical 
with the lower limit of the percentile range of the
-P-A-G-E-130
  114 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
next higher class interval. This may be seen by 
inspecting the tabulated calculations. The percen- 
tile rank which is finally given to all the individuals 
in any class interval is the midpoint of the percentile 
range for that class interval. This is tabulated in the 
last column. 
After the rate has been determined, one registers 
this number in a calculating machine. In the illus- 
tration here given the rate would first be added six 
times (corresponding to the first frequency of 6) ; and 
the machine would then show .oo6, whichis the upper 
percentile rank for the class interval 20-29. The 
lower percentile rank for the lowest class interval is 
of course zero, and the upper percentile rank for the 
highest class interval is necessarily 1.00. Add the 
rate nineteen times more in the machine and it will 
then show .oz9. This isin reality nothing but cumu- 
lative addition. The upper limit, .o06, for the class 
interval 20-29 is identical with the lower limit, .006, 
for the class interval 30-39. Record these per- 
centiles and add the rate cumulatively fifty-six 
times. This will show .094 as the upper percentile 
for the next class interval. 
When the whole column has been completed, one 
will have added the rate n times (.001162 X 860), 
which will give 1.00 for the upper limit of the highest 
class interval. The calculation of percentile ranks 
is greatly facilitated by using a calculating machine, 
such as the Burroughs adding machine with the 
attachment by which the setting may be shifted to 
the right and to the left. 
 
-P-A-G-E-131
  Percentile Ranks 115 
Percentile ranks are calculated by adding the rate 
cumulatively, as indicated by the frequency column. 
The sum thus obtained immediately before adding the 
frequency for any given class interval 1s the lower per- 
centile rank for that class interval. The sum obtained 
after the class frequency times the rate has been added 
is the upper percentile rank for that class interval. 
With the help of an adding machine, the calcula- 
tion of percentile ranks, such as those of the illustra- 
tion, requires only three or four minutes. Any clerk 
can be taught to do this work; and the method here 
described affords an automatic check on the accuracy, 
because the last sum must necessarily be unity. 
The percentile curve is a curve which shows the 
relation between the given variable, such as scores, 
and percentile ranks. By means of a percentile 
curve, one may ascertain at a glance the percentile 
rank corresponding to any given score. The rank is 
of course with reference to the group whose distri- 
bution is represented by the curve. The percentile 
curve is in reality a cumulative frequency curve in 
which the frequency ordinates have been stated as frac- 
tions of n. : 
In Figure 29 we have the percentile curve for the 
frequency table and percentile calculations in Table 
12. The base line represents scores in the test, and 
the ordinates represent percentile ranks. By con- 
sulting the table we find, for example, that the class 
interval 80-89 has a percentile rank of .65. This 
agrees with the curve, which has an elevation of .65 
for the midpoint of the class interval 80-89.
-P-A-G-E-132
  116 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
Note that the class interval 80-89 has a correspond- 
ing percentile range from .569 to .735. This range is 
indicated on the graph by a short vertical line extend- 
ing from the level .569 to the level .735. We can 
therefore read directly from the chart the percentile 
range for each class interval. Note that this vertical

Figure 29. Percentile curve corresponding to Table 12 
line is drawn not at either end of the class interval but 
directly above its midpoint. The curve is plotted by 
drawing these vertical lines as indicated by columns 
5 and 6inthetable. The curve is drawn through the 
midpoints of these vertical lines. In practice one 
may therefore eliminate the calculation of the mid- 
percentiles, since these can be plotted by inspection
-P-A-G-E-133
  Percentile Ranks 117 
with sufficient accuracy for all practical purposes. 
When one becomes accustomed to this work, it is 
possible to eliminate the third, sixth, and seventh 
columns in the table and to determine these facts 
graphically. 
In practice it is found that with a small number of 
cases the curve would not be smooth if it were drawn 
strictly through the midpoints of the vertical lines. 
For this reason one sometimes generalizes the curve 
by smoothing it so as to pass as nearly as possible 
through the midpoints of the successive vertical 
lines. This gives a smoothed percentile curve. The 
reasoning by which a percentile polygon is smoothed 
into a percentile curve is similar to that of the 
smoothing of a frequency polygon into a smoothed 
frequency curve. However, when a percentile curve 
has been smoothed, it is only fair to the reader of 
one’s report that the vertical lines be inserted, be- 
cause they represent the actual observations. The 
reader can ascertain at a glance to what extent the 
curve has been smoothed by noting the deviation of 
the curve from the midpoints of the vertical lines. 
It should also be observed that the percentile poly- 
gon is more readily seen to be continuous than the 
corresponding frequency polygon. Even when the 
frequency polygon is quite irregular, the percentile 
polygon or curve which is plotted on the same draw- 
ing and to the same scale will be relatively continuous 
or smooth. 
We may summarize the properties of the percentile 
curve as follows:
-P-A-G-E-134
  118 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
1. The percentile curve is asymptotic to the base 
line or zero and also to the percentile rank of 100. 
The percentile curve theoretically never reaches zero 
nor 100. Therefore it is theoretically impossible for 
any individual to have a percentile rank of zero or a 
percentile rank of 100. This fact is probably not 
generally recognized. 
2. The median score can be read directly from a 
percentile curve because it is the score which cor- 
responds to the soth-percentile. In the illustra- 
tion we find that the 5oth-percentile gives a score 
of 77, which is the median of the group. This 
saves considerable labor in calculating the balanced 
median. 
3. The upper quartile can be determined in a 
similar manner because the upper quartile point is 
the 75th-percentile. In the illustration the 75th- 
percentile corresponds to a score of 92. The lower 
quartile point corresponds to the 25th-percentile, 
which in the illustration is 63. When the percentile 
curve has been plotted, it is therefore not necessary 
to calculate the quartile points because these can 
be read directly from the graph. From these facts 
one may of course also determine graphically the 
quartile range or the semi-interquartile range, as 
desired. 
4. The mode is defined as the point on the base 
line of a frequency curve directly under the highest 
ordinate of the curve. The mode is therefore that 
score which occurs most frequently in the distribu- 
tion. This can be determined approximately from 
 
-P-A-G-E-135
  Percentile Ranks 119 
the percentile curve by selecting the point on the base 
line directly under the steepest part of the percentile 
curve. Since the percentile curve is in reality a 
cumulative frequency curve, it should be clear that 
the steepest part of the percentile curve is directly 
over that score which occurs with the highest fre- 
quency. While this graphical determination is only 
approximate, it may be sufficiently accurate for prac- 
tical purposes and it saves considerable labor in com- 
putation. 
5. When two distributions are to be compared, 
considerable information may be obtained by simply 
inspecting the percentile curves for the two distribu- 
tions. Thus, for example, the ranges of the distribu- 
tion may be compared by inspecting the ranges of 
the two percentile curves. The variabilities of the 
two distributions may be compared by inspecting the 
relative slopes of the two percentile curves. The 
steeper the general slope of the percentile curve, the 
smaller is the variability of the corresponding dis- 
tribution. The two medians may also be compared 
graphically. 
When a percentile curve is to be constructed, it is 
not necessary to perform all the calculations indicated 
in the accompanying table of data. That table was 
prepared so that it would be complete and so that it 
would show all the steps that are implied in the cal- 
culations. 
In practice it is necessary to calculate only the 
figures in columns 1, 2, 4, and 5. But when the 
calculations are made with an abbreviated form, it
-P-A-G-E-136
  120 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
is absolutely necessary to keep in mind the fact 
that the percentiles recorded in the fifth column are 
not the percentiles that are to be assigned to the 
adjacent class intervals. The percentiles recorded 
in the fifth column indicate the lower percentile of 
the percentile range for each class interval. In order 
to locate the upper percentile for any class interval, 
it is necessary to consult the percentile recorded in 
column 5 for the next higher class interval. This 
becomes easy with practice because the figures are 
then immediately transferred to a chart, which facili- 
tates the interpretation. 
Graphical calculation of percentile ranks.’ It is 
possible to calculate percentile ranks without any 
numerical calculation whatever. A graphical method 
is illustrated in Figure 30. Let us suppose that we 
have a frequency table with the scores arranged 
in class intervals and the corresponding class fre- 
quencies. Let there be 156 cases in the distribution, 
arranged in class intervals of ten along the range 
from zero to 170. Plot the accumulated frequencies 
in the form of vertical lines over the midpoints of 
their respective class intervals. The lengths of these 
lines would be equal to the actual frequencies accord- 
ing to the frequency scale at the right end of the 
diagram. Drawa smooth curve, J, through the mid- 
points of these vertical lines. This is the accumu- 
lated frequency curve. In the diagram the lines 
representing the class frequencies have been omitted 
1 The section on graphical calculation of percentile ranks may be optional 
in the lesson plan, 
 
-P-A-G-E-137

in order to avoid confusion. The accumulated 
frequency curve 4 can be used to determine the 
absolute rank of any member of the group. What 
we want, however, is a similar curve which gives the

Figure 30. A graphical method of calculating percentile ranks 
percentile rank instead of the absolute rank. Draw 
on the left edge of the diagram any suitable scale 
running from zero to 100 to represent percentile 
ranks. 
The graphical construction is made as follows. 
Locate any point, C, at random on the elevation of   
 
-P-A-G-E-138
  122 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
the top of the curve 4. Locate the point £ directly 
under the point C and on the elevation of 100 on the 
percentile scale at the left of the diagram. From 
these two points, C and £, draw straight lines to any 
point, D, on the base line of the diagram. 
Assume any point, /, on the curve 4. Draw a 
horizontal line from this point to its intersection with 
the upper diagonal line, at G. Drop a vertical line 
from G to its intersection with the lower diagonal 
line, at H. Draw a horizontal line from H to a point, 
K, directly under the starting point, F. This point 
K is the point on the percentile curve correspond- 
ing to the point F on the curve of absolute ranks. 
Proceed similarly with a number of other points on 
the curve 4. In the lower part of the diagram the 
same procedure has been indicated for another point, 
F’, on the curve 4. 
Draw a smooth curve through the points so located. 
This will be the desired percentile curve, B. The 
procedure is very easily carried out on a drawing 
board, in fact, much more easily than the verbal 
description would indicate. In plotting the original 
curve, 4, of accumulated frequencies, one should 
be careful to draw it through the midpoints of 
the vertical lines which represent the class fre- 
quencies. 
An automatic check on the plotting of this curve 
is obtained in the fact that the total elevation of the 
vertical lines for curve 4 should equal the total 
number of cases in the distribution, which in the 
illustration is 156. 
 
-P-A-G-E-139
  Percentile Ranks 123 
Where suitable calculating machines are avail- 
able, this graphical procedure is not recommended. 
It is then best to deal with the numerical fre- 
quencies and the numerical forms of the percentile 
ranks as indicated in the accompanying frequency 
table. 
It is essential that those who use percentile ranks 
in the tabulation of educational and psychological 
measurements should understand the fundamental 
properties of the percentile curve. If one becomes 
accustomed to the correct calculation of the percen- 
tile ranks, he will not be inclined to tolerate rough- 
and-ready guesses for the percentile ranks that 
should be assigned to given scores. The most fre- 
quent error in the assignment of percentile ranks to 
given scores is in the form of a constant error. This 
is caused by the fact that the percentile is determined 
either for the upper edge of a class interval or for 
the lower edge. This percentile is used for the 
whole class interval instead of the one which corre- 
sponds closely to the midpoint of the interval. The 
error is avoided by following the procedure illustrated 
in Table r2 with percentile calculations. 
Problem 1. Assume that you have before you a table with 
two columns.. In the first column are the examination marks 
for a group of students. In the second column are the percen- 
tile ranks. On the assumption that the distribution of marks 
is normal, how would you estimate approximately the standard 
deviation of the distribution of marks ? 
Problem 2. Prepare a table of percentile ranks for each of 
Tables 3, 4,9, and 14.
-P-A-G-E-140

Problem 3. Draw the percentile curves corresponding to 
Tables 3, 4, 9, and 14. 
Problem 4. Assume that you have before you the names of 
one thousand students with the percentile rank of each student 
in an examination. Draw a freehand sketch to show the general 
appearance of the frequency curve of these percentile ranks. 
Draw another sketch on the same base line to show the general 
appearance of the distribution of five hundred percentile ranks 
drawn at random from the list of one thousand names. 
Problem 5. Assume that there are ten students in a class 
and that they have different marks in an examination. What 
would be their percentile ranks? Remember that no one can 
have a percentile rank of 0 or 100. 
Problem 6. Make a freehand sketch of two percentile curves 
on the same chart to represent two frequency distributions, 4 
and B, which have the same mean and the same number of 
cases. The distribution 4 has a wider scatter than B. Label 
the two curves. 
Problem 7. Make a freehand sketch of two percentile curves 
on the same chart to represent two frequency distributions, 4 
and B, which have the same mean and standard deviation. 
The distribution 4 has a larger number of cases than B. Label 
the two curves. 
Problem 8. Make a freehand sketch of two percentile curves 
on the*same chart to represent two frequency distributions, 4 
and B, which have the same standard deviation and the same 
number of cases. The distribution 4 has a higher mean than 
B. Label the two curves. 
Problem 9. The table on the following page represents the 
distribution of stature of 750 freshmen at Ohio State Univer- 
sity in 1913. Calculate the percentile ranks corresponding to 
the specified heights. State the percentile rank of a student 
whose stature is 5 feet 10 inches. Explain just what is meant 
by his percentile rank in this case.

The Binomial Expansion 
The frequency distributions of mental abilities and 
of anthropometric measurements conform more or 
less closely to the so-called probability curve. The 
statistical methods of treating distributions which 
approximate the symmetrical form of the probability 
curve necessitate some consideration of the statistical 
properties of the curve. 
Permutations. The different ways in which a 
number of things can be arranged in a series are 
called permutations. Let us consider the two things 
aand b. These can be arranged in two ways, ab and 
ba. These two arrangements are called permuta- 
tions. 
Let us consider the three things a, b, and c. If we 
group these three things, taking only two at a time, 
we have six possible permutations, namely, 
ab ba ca 
ac be cb 
Each of three things is here combined successively 
with one of the other things. If we group the three 
things, taking three at a time, we have six permuta- 
tions, namely, | 
abc bac cab | 
ach bea cha | 
126 
 
-P-A-G-E-143
  The Binomial Expansion 127 
Let us consider four things, a, b,c,d. If we group 
these four things, taking two at a time, we have 
twelve permutations, namely, 
ab ba ca da 
ac bec cb db 
ad bd cd dc 
Here, as before, each one of the things is combined 
with each of the other things. If we group the four 
things, taking three at a time, we have twenty-four 
permutations, namely, 
abc abd acd bed 
ach adb adc bdc 
bac bad cad chd 
bea bda cda cdb 
cab dab dac dbc 
cha dba dca dcb 
Similarly, if we group the four things, taking four at 
a time, we have twenty-four permutations. 
The number of possible permutations of 7 things, 
taken r at a time, can be predicted by the following 
formula: 
P,, = n(n — 1) (n — 2) (n — 3) + (n —7 +1) 
The preceding examples may be verified with this 
formula. Thus the number of permutations of four 
things, taken three at a time, is 4 (4 — 1) (4 — 2) 
= 24. : 
Combinations. Combinations differ from permu- 
tations in that one combination such as abc may be 
stated in the form of several permutations by simply 
rearranging the order in which the things occur in
-P-A-G-E-144
  
128 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
the series, such as abc, ach, bac, bca, cab, cba. All of 
these are considered to be one combination, but they 
represent six permutations. In any given situation 
the number of permutations is always greater than 
the number of possible combinations. 
Let us consider the two things a and 6. The num- 
ber of combinations of these two things, taken two at 
a time, is only one, namely, ab. If we consider the 
three things a, b, c, taking two at a time, we have 
three possible combinations, namely, ab, ac, be. If 
we consider the three things, taking three at a time, 
we have only one possible combination, namely, abc. 
Let us consider the four things a, b, c, d. If we 
group these four things, taking two at a time, we 
have six possible combinations, namely, ab, ac, ad, 
be, bd, cd. If we group the four things, taking three 
at a time, we have four possible combinations, 
namely, abc, abd, acd, bed. If we group the four 
things, taking four at a time, we have only one ae 
sible combination. 
The number of combinations of n things, cue r 
at a time, can be predicted by the following formula : 
n(n — 1)(n — 2)(n — 3) +: (n —7 + 1) 
rl Cor =   
in which 7 / represents factorial r or (I X 2 X 3 X 4 
x 5.---r). Thus the number of combinations of 
four things, taking three at a time, is

The Binomial Expansion 129 
It may assist the student in his understanding 
of combinations and permutations to consider the 
following example. Suppose that you have bought 
two articles. When you have bought them, your 
total purchase will constitute one combination of 
two things. But you may have bought them in 
different orders. The order of the separate pur- 
chases may be ab or ba. These orders are called 
permutations. Thus we have two permutations of 
the two things, but only one combination of them. 
Now consider yourself buying two things, with 
three things from which to choose. How many com- 
binations are possible? The number of combina- 
tions is the number of purchases that you can make 
with two things in each purchase. If the three things 
are a, b, c, and if you are limited to the purchase of 
any two of them, you will have three possible pur- 
chases, namely, ab, ac, bc. In statistical language, 
we should say that there are three combinations of 
three things, taken two at a time. The two things 
in each purchase may be bought in different order. 
In statistical language, we should say that there are 
six permutations of three things, taken two at a time. 
Probability of single event. Suppose that fifty 
white balls and fifty black balls are placed in a bag. 
If we draw one ball at random from the bag, the 
probability is 4 that it will be a white ball and the 
probability is 3 that it will be a black ball. The sum 
of the two probabilities is equal to unity or certainty. 
We can state this relation as follows : 
Pee ae
-P-A-G-E-146
  130 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
If the bag contains 16 white balls, 20 black balls, 24 
green balls, and 28 red balls, there is a total of 88 
balls in the bag. Now if we draw 1 ball at random 
from the bag, the probability is $8, or .182, that it 
will be a white ball. The probability is 24, or .273, 
that it will be a green ball. The probabilities for 
the remaining colors appearing in a single draw are 
indicated in the following equation : 
Py + Psp + Pat Pr =1, 
or 182 + .227 + .273 + .318 = 1. 
The probability is a ratio between the number of 
possibilities in favor of any specified color and the 
total number of possibilities involved. Since there 
are only four colors represented by the balls in the 
bag, it follows that the sum of the probabilities for 
the four colors must equal unity or certainty. 
If we are interested in drawing a white ball from 
the bag and prefer to avoid drawing: one of the 
colored balls, then the probability of drawing a white 
ball is called the probability of success, which in this 
case is .182. The probability of failure is the proba- 
bility of drawing a colored ball, which is the sum 
of the remaining probabilities, namely, .818. The 
probability of success would in this case be roughly 
as one to five. If one were betting, one would come 
out even in the long run by betting ‘one to five on 
white. 
The probability of success is usually designated 
by the letter P, and the probability of failure is 
designated by the letter Q, so that P +Q = 1.

Probability of compound event. Suppose that the 
bag contains fifty white balls and fifty black balls. 
If we draw two balls at random from the bag, we may 
have the following permutations : 
1. White, white 
2. White, black 
3. Black, white 
4. Black, black 
These probabilities represent three combinations, 
namely, 
1. Two white balls 
2. Two black balls 
3. One white and one black ball 
The probability of compound events refers to such 
problems as the probability of drawing two white 
balls in succession, one white ball and one black ball 
in two draws, four white balls in five draws, etc. 
What is the probability of drawing two white balls 
in succession? The probability of drawing a white 
ball in the first draw is .5 and the probability of draw- 
ing a white ball in the second draw is also .5, if we 
assume that the first ball is returned to the bag be- 
fore the second draw is made. Our problem now is 
to determine the probability of drawing two white 
balls in succession. We draw a white ball in the 
first draw in only one-half of the cases. Of these 
successful first draws, one-half will be eliminated by 
the fact that the second draw is a black ball in one- 
half of the cases. Hence we should expect to draw 
two white balls in succession in one-fourth of the
-P-A-G-E-148
  132 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
cases. This can be generalized by saying that the 
probability of drawing two white balls in succession 
is the product of the probabilities of the two draws, 
Ineaelyan Saxe Ge = 256 
If the bag contains 20 white balls and 80 black 
balls, the probability of drawing a white ball is .2. 
The probability of drawing two white balls in suc- 
cession is .2 X .2 = .o4. The probability of draw- 
ing three white balls in succession is (.2)? = .008; 
in other words, this would happen only about eight 
times in every one thousand complete draws. The

-P-A-G-E-149
  The Binomial Expansion Tag 
If we apply this equation to the probability for com- 
pound events, such as tossing four coins, the signifi- 
cance of the several terms is as follows: the first term 
represents the probability that all four coins will fall 
‘heads; the second term represents the probability 
that three of the four coins will fall heads; the third 
term represents the probability that two of the four 
coins will fall heads; the fourth term represents the 
probability that one of the four coins will fall heads ; 
the fifth term represents the probability that all four 
coins will fall tails. The sum of these five probabili- 
ties is equal to certainty, which is designated unity. 
Let us analyze the first five terms of the expansion 
with special reference to the tossing of four coins. 
The five terms represent respectively the probabili- 
ties of getting four heads, three heads, two heads, one 
head, and no heads. The sum of these five terms is 
unity when four events are considered. 
The first term. If a coin is tossed once, the 
probability of having it fall heads is $ and the 
probability of having it fall tails is. The probabil- 
ity of getting four coins in succession to fall heads is 
4x4x4xX4= 4) = 74. This principle has been 
established in the preceding section on the probability 
for compound events. Since we are considering heads 
as success and tails as failure, the notation for this 
probability becomes P”, in which P = } and n = 4, 
which gives 7. Therefore, in the long run, we 
should expect to find that one out of every sixteen 
throws of four coins will give us four heads. This is 
the first term of the binomial expansion,
-P-A-G-E-150
  
134 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
The second term. The probability of all heads in 
the first three tosses is P? = (4)° = } and the proba- 
bility of tails in the fourth toss isQ = 3. Therefore 
the probability of getting heads in the first three 
tosses and tails in the fourth toss is P}Q =}4 xX 4 
= ,;. But what we really want to know is the 
probability of getting heads in any three of four 
tosses. This implies that the one coin which may 
fall tails can be the first coin, the second coin, the 
third coin, or the fourth coin. Therefore, we should 
expect that “ heads in any three of four tosses ” will 
occur four times as frequently as “ heads in the first 
three tosses and tails in the fourth toss.” The possi- 
bilities of heads in any three of four tosses may 
be expressed as follows: 
ays 
3h vel

We have already seen that the probability of three 
heads in the first three tosses and tails in the fourth 
isz,. The probability of heads in the first two tosses 
is (3)? = 4, and the probability of tails in the third 
toss is}. Therefore the probability of getting heads 
in the first two tosses and tails in the third toss is 
P?Q =1. The probability of getting heads in the 
last toss is 3. Thus the probability of getting heads 
in the first two tosses, tails in the third toss, and 
heads in the fourth toss is 
PQP =EX4EX I= de
-P-A-G-E-151
  The Binomial Expansion 135 
Similarly it can be shown that the probability of 
getting heads in the first toss, tails in the second, 
and heads in the last two is 3, and also that the 
probability of getting tails in the first toss and heads 
in the last three tosses is 7. The sum of these four 
probabilities, #, + ~ + Hs +s = 4, is the prob- 
ability of getting heads in any three of four tosses. 
This probability of heads in any three of four tosses 
is given by the second term of the binomial expan- 
sion, which is 
nPQ = 4Q)"Q) = 4-ce = te = 4 The third term. The probability that the first 
two tosses will be heads is P? = (3)? =3. The 
probability that the last two tosses will be tails is 
Q? = (4)? =4. The probability that the first two 
tosses will be heads and the last two tosses tails is the 
product of these two probabilities, namely, P*°Q?. 
This accounts for a part of the third term of the 
binomial expansion. But what we really want is the 
probability of heads in any two of four tosses. The 
probability of heads in any two of four tosses will be 
greater than 4, because the two heads may appear 
in any one of the following combinations: 1-2, 1-3, 
I-4, 2-3, 2-4, 3-4. These numbers indicate tosses. 
The probability of heads in any two of four tosses is 
therefore 38. The factor 6 is determined by the 16° 
n(n — 1) coefficient Tara in which n = 4. This factor is 
the number of combinations in which four things can 
be arranged, taking two at atime. It is the formula
-P-A-G-E-152
  136 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
described in the preceding section on combinations. 
The third term in the binomial expansion represents 
the probability of heads in any two of four tosses, 
when ” = 4, P= }, and Q= }. 
The fourth term. The probability that the first 
toss will be heads is P”* = 4. The probability that 
the last three tosses will be tails is Q* = (4)* = 1. 
Therefore the probability that the first toss will be 
heads and the last three tosses tails is 
BOS (a) a) Gh a. 
As before, however, what we really want is the proba- 
bility of a head in any one of four tosses. This 
implies that the three tails may occur in any com- 
bination in the four tosses. Now, the number of 
combinations of four things, taking three at a time, is 
Ge) ei) al Avo 2s 
er 24 ore   
Therefore the occurrence of a head in any one of four 
tosses is four times as frequent as the occurrence of a 
head on only the first of the four tosses. The proba- 
bility of a head in any one of four tosses is repre- 
sented by the fourth term in the binomial expansion. 
This term is

This coefficient .represents the number of combina- 
tions of four things, taking four at a time. It turns 
out to be 1, and this agrees with common sense be- 
cause there can obviously be only one combination of 
four things, taking all four of them at a time. The 
probability of four tails in four tosses is therefore 3,. 
It is important to notice that the five terms add up 
to unity. The numerical form of the equation is as 
follows :

Six tosses. As an illustration of the application of 
the binomial expansion to a longer series of tosses we 
have in the following outline the result for six tosses. 
The method is exactly the same. Two additional 
terms of the expansion are necessary and these are 
written by extending the continuity of the series. 
All the possibilities for six tosses are represented 
in the following list : 
Six heads, no tails 
Five heads, one tail 
Four heads, two tails 
Three heads, three tails 
Two heads, four tails 
One head, five tails 
No heads, six tails 
One sees here that, with six tosses in the series, 
seven terms are required to represent the possible 
combinations of heads and tails. These seven terms WANES Do

The numerical evaluation of these terms is indicated 
in Table 13. Note that the sum of all the probabili- 
ties is equal to unity. 
The student will probably find Table 13 very useful 
in studying the binomial expansion. Notice, for 
example, that the probability of having all heads in 
six tosses is the same as the probability of having 
all tails in six tosses. Similarly, the probability of 
having four heads in six tosses is the same as the 
probability of having four tails (two heads) in six 
tosses. These relations should be mastered not only 
as far as the algebraic notation is concerned but also 
as to their reasonableness. 
In Figure 31 we have represented the probabilities 
for these six events in graphical form. Notice that 
we have a curve of familiar shape, high in the cen- 
tral region and low at the extremes. The shaded +

  The Binomial Expansion . I4I 
Refer to the preceding table for six tosses. Note, 
for example, that the probability of getting two 
heads in six tosses is 4% or .234. If six coins are 
tossed in one thousand trials, we should expect 
approximately 234 of the trials to give two heads. 
Problem 1. Calculate by means of the binomial expansion 
the probabilities of getting one, two, three, etc. heads in eight 
tosses of a coin. This will necessitate the use of nine terms of 
the expansion. Plot a theoretical probability curve for your 
calculations. If a coin were tossed on 648 trials with eight 
tosses on every trial, in how many of these trials would you 
expect to have five heads in eight tosses? 
Problem 2. If some one offers to bet ten dollars to one of 
yours that you cannot get five heads or more in six tosses, and 
if he is willing to keep on betting this way, how much would you 
expect to gain or lose after one hundred such bets? (See table 
in text for six tosses.) 
Problem 3. Show what is wrong with the following reason- 
ing. “The probability of drawing a red card from a deck of 
cards is 3, and the probability of drawing a black card is also $ on 
the assumption that the joker has been removed. Therefore 
the probability of drawing five red cards in ten successive draws 
is also 3.” 
What is the probability of drawing five red cards in ten 
draws? Assume that the card which is drawn is returned to 
the deck before the next card is drawn. 
Problem 4. Assume that a bag contains 200 balls in the 
following proportions: 40 red, 50 green, 50 blue, 40 black, 
20 white. Designate the red, green, and blue balls as colored. 
Calculate the probability of drawing one, two, three, etc. colored 
balls in six draws. Arrange your calculations as shown in the 
calculations for six tosses in the text. Note that your values 
for P and Q in this problem will not be identical as they are in 
the text problem. Plot the probabilities. How does this curve 
vary from the usual probability curve? Show that the shape 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
  
142 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
of this curve could have been foreseen as reasonable by logical 
considerations before plotting the curve. 
Problem 5. Assume that you have ten cards before you, and 
that five of them are red, five of them are black. The cards 
are shuffled and you are to draw five cards from the pile of ten 
cards. Assume also that you do not return each card to the 
pile after it has been drawn. Calculate the probability of 
drawing five red cards from the pile. Note that this probabil- 
ity is less than (3)°. Why is this reasonable ?

The Probability Curve 
The curve represented by the successive terms of 
the binomial expansion is called the probability curve 
or the normal curve. It can be stated in the form of 
the equation 
= yoese, (1) 
in which 
x = the deviation from the mean in terms of the 
standard deviation, 
y = the ordinate and represents expected frequency, 
o =the standard deviation of the distribution in 
terms of class intervals, 
e = the constant 2.718, known as the Napierian base, 
yo = the ordinate at the mean. 
This equation enables one to determine the ordi- 
nate of the probability curve at any deviation from 
the mean. 
The ordinate at the mean is expressed by the rela- 
tion 
n n 
ee ea ee @)     
in which 
n = the number of cases in the distribution, 
o =the standard deviation of the distribution in 
terms of class intervals, 
a = the constant 3.1416. 
143
-P-A-G-E-160
  144 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
By means of this equation one can determine the 
expected frequency at the mean in terms of the num- 
ber of cases and the standard deviation, expressed in 
terms of the class intervals. 
The more complete form of the equation for the 
probability curve is therefore 
  
sane Pae ’ (3) 
which enables one to superimpose a normal probabil- 
ity curve on a given frequency distribution to de- 
termine how closely the experimental data conform 
to the normal probability curve. 
In order to do this one must first calculate the 
expected frequency at the mean by equation (2). 
The standard deviation and the number of cases are 
determined in the usual way. When the expected 
frequency at the mean has been determined by equa- 
tion (2), one can determine from Table ro, in the 
appendix, the ordinates of the remainder of the curve. 
These ordinates are given in the table as fractions of 
the ordinate at the mean. Thus, for example, we 
find from the table that the ordinate at 1o is .606. 
If the ordinate at the mean is 100, the ordinate at 10 
would be 60.6 and similarly for other points on the 
curve. The curve is symmetrical about the mean 
and therefore the ordinates for positive values of o 
are identical with the ordinates for the corresponding 
negative values of o. Thus the ordinate of the 
probability curve at — .740 is .760 of the ordinate
-P-A-G-E-161
  The Probability Curve 145 
at the mean. If the ordinate at the mean were I00, 
the ordinate at — .74.0 would be 76. 
Let us suppose that a frequency distribution has 
been plotted as in Figure 32. We desire to super- 
impose the probability curve on this distribution in 
order to see how far the actual distribution deviates 
from the normal curve. The small circles in the

follows :

Table 14. Note that since o is there calculated in 
terms of column d, the o will be expressed in terms 
of class intervals. Hence o = 4.61 class intervals or

each class interval. 
2. Calculate the true mean of the distribution as 
shown in Table 14. The true mean is 88.9 score 
units. The sigma scale has its origin at this point, 
as shown in Figure 32.

column are fractional parts of the mean ordinate 590. 
Note by Figure 32 that these frequencies, y, are 
identical for positive and negative values of o, the 
probability curve being symmetrical. 
Verify several of the ordinates on the probability 
curve in Figure 32. We can now see to what extent 
the actual frequency distribution of the 6806 test 
scores deviate from the probability curve. Note 
that the test score distribution is slightly positively 
skewed. The deviation from the normal surface is 
relatively slight but noticeable. 
Table 19 can be used not only to determine the 
ordinate for given deviations from the mean but also 
for determining the deviation from the mean at 
which a given frequency may be expected when the 
frequency at the mean’is known. Thus if we want 
to determine the deviation from the mean at which 
the expected frequency is one-half of the frequency at 
the mean, we find .50 in Table 19, which shows that a 
frequency one-half of the frequency at the mean can 
be expected at 1.18 0 and at — 1.186.

The Area of the Frequency Surface 
We have previously noted that the area of the 
frequency surface is proportional to the number of 
cases represented. If the area under the probability 
curve is assumed to be unity, it is possible to state 
the ratio of the total number of cases between any 
two specified points on the X-scale to the total num- 
ber of cases in the distribution. In Table 20 these 
ratios are tabulated. 
Suppose that we want to know what fractional part 
of the whole surface lies between the mean and 
+1.50. This part of the probability surface is 
represented by the cross-hatched area of the first 
diagram in Figure 33. By reference to Table 20 we 
find the fraction .4332, which indicates that 43% of 
the total number of cases in a normal surface are 
located between the mean and + 1.50. If the total 
number of cases, 7, is 500, the number of cases be- 
tween the mean and + 1.5 would be 500 X .43 or 
215 cases. The same procedure is followed for other 
similar problems. 
Now suppose that we desire to know the number of 
cases between + .420 and + 1.680 in a normal dis- 
tribution with 460 cases. This part of the probabil- 
ity surface is also represented by a cross-hatched dia- 
150
-P-A-G-E-167
  
The Area of the Frequency Surface ISI 
gram in Figure 33. By reference to Table 20 we find 
that 16.28% of the cases lie between the mean and 
+ .420 in a normal surface. Similarly we find from 
the same table that 45.35% of the total distribution 
is to be found between the mean and + 1.68c. 
The difference between these two percentages, 45.35 
— 16.28, is 29.07. Hence 29.07% of the total 
number of cases lies between + .420 and + 1.68c. 
Since n is 460, the answer to our problem is 
460 X 29.07 = 134, which is the number of cases to 
be expected between + .42 0 and 1.680. 
Suppose that we want to know the number of 
cases between the mean and — .65 0 in a normal dis- 
tribution of 280 cases. See Figure 33. We find that 
24.22% of the total number of cases lie between the 
mean and — .65o0. Note that, since the curve is 
symmetrical about the mean, there will be the same 
number of cases between the mean and — .65o0 as 
between the mean and + .650. Since 7 is 280, the 
answer to our problem is 280 X 24.22 = 67.8. 
Still another combination is the problem to de- 
termine the number of cases to be expected between, 
say, — .48o0 and + 2.120. See Figure 33. To 
solve this we divide the surface into two parts, the 
division being made at the mean. We find that 
18.44% of the whole surface is in the negative part of 
the shaded area and 48.30% of the surface is in the 
positive part of the shaded area. Adding these two 
percentages, we have 18.44 + 48.30 = 66.74%, as 
the percentage of the whole surface between — .480 
and 2,12¢.

Chapter Twenty 
Transmutation of Measures 
The distinction between ranks and standings is a 
fundamental one in statistical work. If the individ- 
uals in a group are to be studied as to the distribution 
of stature, for example, we may designate the rela- 
tive position of any member of the group with refer- 
ence to the rest of the group by stating his absolute 
or percentile rank or by the actual variable in terms 
of inches, in terms of deviation in inches from the 
mean, or in terms of the standard deviation. In the 
first case we are concerned with ranks and in the 
second case we are concerned with standings. 
The distinction between ranks and standings can 
perhaps be made clear by an example. If all the one 
hundred individuals in a group are arranged accord- 
ing to stature from the shortest to the tallest and 
assigned absolute ranks, the difference between any 
two adjacent individuals will be the same in terms of 
ranks. But in terms of stature the difference be- 
tween any pair of adjacent individuals will not be the 
same. The difference in stature between two adja- 
cent individuals will be relatively great at the ex- 
tremes and relatively small in the middle range of 
the distribution. The actual difference in stature in 
inches represented by the percentile range 40 to 60 is 
not nearly so great as the actual difference in stature 
155
-P-A-G-E-172
  156 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
represented by the percentile range 80 to 100. This 
is because the frequencies in the middle class intervals 
are usually greater than the frequencies at the ex- 
tremes. 
When we translate the data from one of these forms 
to the other, the procedure is known as transmutation 
of measures. If the data are given in the form of 
percentile ranks, we are unable to say anything 
regarding the form of the distribution. It may be 
normal or skewed. The ranks tell us nothing about 
this. When it is desirable to express a series of ranks 
in the form of standings, one generally assumes that 
the distribution is normal. 
Suppose that two judges have given estimates of 
the same group of individuals and that it is desired 
to combine the two judgments for each person into a 
single combined judgment. If the two judges had in 
mind the same scale, the combination could be made 
directly, but usually one judge is more lenient than 
the other, or he uses more differentiating steps in his 
estimates. Let both judges use the same symbols, 
A, B, C, D, for their estimates, with 4 as the highest 
estimate, and D as the lowest estimate. If one 
judge gives twice as many grades of 4 as the other 
judge, it would not be fair to consider the grades of 
the two judges as equivalent. If one individual is 
rated C by one judge and B by the more lenient 
judge, our problem is to assign for statistical treat- 
ment some single score to this individual based on the 
two separate judgments. 
We assume that the abilities judged are distributed
-P-A-G-E-173
  Transmutation of Measures 157 
in the form of a normal probability surface. For the 
purpose of illustration let there be one hundred in- 
dividuals in the group. Let the number of grades 
assigned by each judge be as follows: 
  Jupcr 1 Jupcr 2 
Grade A 40 20, 
Grade B 30 30 
Grade C 20 30 
Grade D 10 20 
n = 100 n = 100 
It is apparent that Judge 1 grades more leniently 
than Judge 2. 
The transmutation of measures is a very simple 
operation. First make a rough pencil sketch similar 
  
  
  
  Figure 34. Transmutation of measures 
to Figure 34, to represent the distribution of grades 
assigned by Judge 1. The sketch should contain the 
outline of the normal frequency surface and vertical 
lines to indicate the letter grade groups. In this

  158 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
particular problem there are four such groups. The 
A grades are given to forty per cent of the group and 
hence will be indicated on the sketch by a section 
almost as large as half of the total frequency surface.

Table 15. Transmutation of measures 
The B grades are given to the next thirty per cent 
and that section is smaller and contains the mean or 
median. The other sections are indicated on the 
sketch in a similar manner. From the sketch it 
can now be seen that the middle person in the 4 
group is removed thirty per cent from the median 
of the whole group. The sigma value for the point 
in the surface which is removed thirty per cent 
of the whole group from the median is .84 0, as de- 
termined from Table 20. In Table 15 we have the 
calculation indicated for Judge 1. A similar table 
is made for each judge. The sigma equivalents 
 
-P-A-G-E-175
Transmutation of Measures 159 
for the letter grades given by the two judges are 
tabulated below. 
Srtcma EQUIVALENTS FOR LETTER GRADES 
Judge 1 Judge 2 
Grade A 840 1.286 
Grade B — 13 o; 390 
Grade C Cee o 85 
Grade D — 1.65 o 19.28 6 
If we desire to combine the estimates of the two 
judges, we can now do so by assigning the numerical 
equivalents of the letter grades and averaging them. 
Thus if one of the individuals in the group was given 
a grade of 4 by Judge 1 and a grade of C by Judge 2, 
his combined standing would be 
+ .84 — .39 
2 =-+ .22 
This is the best possible way of combining the sepa- 
rate judgments. It assumes that the distribution of 
the abilities estimated is normal, and it also assumes 
that we place equal confidence in the judgments of 
each judge. These assumptions may or may not be 
true, but they serve as the connecting link by which 
the two separate judgments are brought together into 
one combined judgment for statistical treatment. 
This procedure enables one not only to combine 
disparate judgments in a reasonable way but it also 
enables one to state in objective form the standards 
used by the judges. The procedure can be applied 
to such varied data as the scholarship grades of 
teachers, judgments on rating scales, and estimates 
of abilities to be used as criteria for determining the
-P-A-G-E-176
  
160 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
predictive value of mental tests. There is an almost 
universal tendency to overestimate abilities no mat- 
ter who the judge may be. This is appropriate in its 
place but it is troublesome in statistical analyses. 
All of the members of a group cannot possibly be 
above the average of the group. A recent newspaper 
account of illiteracy in the draft army made the 
alarming statement that one-half of a regiment was 
below the average of the regiment ! 
Problem 1. The following is the distribution of estimates of 
three judges : Juvcer Juvce2 Juvcr 3 
Grade A 20 12 35 
Grade B 22 22 a2) 
Grade C 19 32 20 
Grade D 24 277, 17, 
Grade E 21 13 12 
106 106 106 
Determine the sigma standing to be assigned to each grade 
by each judge for the purpose of combining the estimates. 
Prepare a table of such equivalent standings. What would be 
the sigma standing of an individual who is rated B by judge 
1, 4 by judge 2, and D by judge 3? What is the maximum 
sigma standing possible with this transmutation, and what is 
the minimum possible standing ? 
Problem 2. Prepare a table with two columns to show the 
relation between percentile ranks and sigma standing for a 
normal distribution. Make the entries in the percentile column 
0, 5, 10, 15, 20, etc., and determine the corresponding standings 
from the tables in the appendix. 
Prepare a similar table with the same headings. Make the en- 
tries in the sigma columns — 3 0, — 2.5 0, — 2.00, — 1.5 9, etc., 
and determine the corresponding percentile ranks from the tables. 
Show in some graphical way the distinction between ranks 
and standings.

Chapter Twenty-one 
The Probable Error 
Reliability of statistical measures. Everybody is 
figuring probable errors. Statistical jobs in educa- 
tion are being justified as scientific, dignified, and 
trustworthy by the fact that probable errors have 
been figured. It is essential to ascertain what the 
probable error means, and what it does not mean, 
what it does show and what it does not show, the 
kind of reliability that it does give as well as the 
kind of assurance that it does not give at all. By 
noting the assumptions that are basic for the prob- 
able error, the constant can be intelligently used, and 
the mistake will not be made of assuming that just 
because the probable error is small the statistical 
values are therefore trustworthy. 
Suppose that you want to know the average age of 
all sixth-grade children in the city of Chicago. The 
ideal and complete way to answer such a question 
would be to list the actual age of every sixth-grade 
child in that city. In most circumstances it is very 
difficult to obtain complete data for answering 
statistical questions. One has recourse to the data 
for a smaller but supposedly representative group. 
In the case of the illustration you would probably 
ascertain the ages of perhaps one thousand sixth- 
grade children and determine their average age. 
161
-P-A-G-E-178
  162 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
You would use that figure as representative of the 
average for the whole city. The smaller group that 
you actually study, instead of the whole group that 
you would use in the ideal situation, is called a 
sample. 
If the sample were one thousand sixth-grade chil- 
dren, their average age would be thought of as a 
fairly reliable figure because one thousand is a large 
number. If the sampling were one hundred children 
instead of one thousand, the average age would be 
thought of as less reliable. If the sample were re- 
duced to ten children, their average age would be a 
relatively unreliable measure of the age of sixth-grade 
children in the whole city. Finally, if the sample 
were reduced to three or four children, their average 
age would be so unreliable that we should place no 
confidence in it whatever, as far as representing the 
city is concerned. It is clear that as we increase the 
number of cases for which an average, or arithmetic 
mean, is calculated, the reliability, or the confidence, 
that we attach to the figure is considerably enhanced. 
This is nothing but common sense. Stated in more 
technical language, we should say that the reliability 
of an average is a function of the number of cases in 
the sample. 
If we have ascertained the ages of one hundred 
children and calculated their average, and if we are 
using this average to prove something, it is of course 
important to be able to say just how reliable that 
average is. Stated in more statistical form, the 
problem is to determine how much the average age
-P-A-G-E-179
  
  The Probable Error 163 
might be expected to fluctuate if we should repeat 
the tabulation for another group of one hundred 
children, and for still another group, and so on. It is 
obvious that the average ages of the successive groups 
of children, with one hundred in each group, would 
not be absolutely the same. There’ would be minor 
fluctuations by mere chance even if the other factors 
of selection were kept uniform. 
The minor fluctuations in the average age of suc- 
cessive groups of one hundred sixth-grade. children 
would be relatively small. . The fluctuations in the 
average age of successive groups would-be larger if 
the groups were made smaller... Finally, if the groups 
were reduced in size until there were only one child 
for each group, instead of one hundred, the |fluctua- 
tions in the average age of successive groups would 
be as large as the fluctuations in the ages of indi- 
vidual sixth-grade children. The purpose of the 
probable error, as applied to the arithmetic mean, is 
to indicate the relative magnitude of the fluctua- 
tions that are to be expected if successive groups, or 
samples, are obtained for calculating the mean. 
Different sources of unreliability. There are sev- 
eral kinds of errors to-be considered in statistical 
work in education and in the social sciences. One 
kind of error in the arithmetic average of a lot of 
numbers is that which is brought about by mere 
chance. These errors are relatively slight when the 
groups are large. If the average age for one hundred * 
children were found to be 11.86 years, it is probable 
that the next similar group of children would have an
-P-A-G-E-180
  
164 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
average age more or less closely approximating this 
number, although it would probably not agree to the 
second or third decimal place. 
There is another kind of error which causes much 
more serious disturbance in statistical work, namely, 
that which is brought about by unintentionally 
loading the sample so that it is not representative of 
what we are really trying to measure. If children of 
the sixth grade are studied in some particular school, 
or part of a city, it would usually be found that a 
similar group of children from some other part of 
the city, representing a different social class, would 
show markedly different constants as to age, height, 
weight, intelligence, and other measures. An error 
of sampling whereby the group that is studied does 
not represent that which it is supposed to represent 
in the statistical study, causes errors far more serious 
than those which are brought about by chance fluctu- 
ations. It should be borne in mind that the probable 
error gives assurance regarding the relative magni- 
tude of the expected fluctuations which are due to 
mere chance, but the probable error tells us abso- 
lutely nothing regarding the other and more impor- 
tant factors in selection of the groups to be studied by 
which they are not representative of the purposes 
of the statistical inquiry. It is essential to recognize 
that the probable error takes into account the fluctua- 
tions which are, in most practical studies, the small- 
‘est and least important of the fluctuations which 
disturb the confidence that one attaches to statistical 
routine. For example, assume that sixth-grade chil-
-P-A-G-E-181
The Probable Error 165 
dren are classified by name, alphabetically, and that 
the investigator selects at. random a continuous 
stretch of one hundred names from the alphabetical 
list. This would seem to be a random selection of 
the group to be studied, because the first letter of the 
child’s name does not seem to be related positively 
with any of the traits that might be inquired about in 
a statistical study. Such a procedure would, how- 
ever, have the possibility of giving an unintentional 
loading of the sample with some nationality in the 
city population, that, in turn, might conceivably in- 
troduce traits which are represented more heavily 
in the sample than they should be in order to repre- 
sent the city as a whole. Such errors of sampling, 
and hundreds of other factors which bear on the 
legitimacy of the selection of a representative group, 
are not even touched by the probable errors of the 
resulting figures. Throughout the study of the 
probable error, and the other statistical constants 
that measure the reliability or unreliability of statis- 
tical measures, one should bear in mind that they give 
us some indication of the expected degree of fluctua- 
tion in successive samples selected in the same way, 
and that this indication refers to the least important 
of the various causes that disturb the validity of 
statistical findings, namely, the factor of chance 
fluctuation. 
An experiment with the probable error. Assume 
that one thousand numbers have been written on 
cards, one for each card. Let the total range of the 
numbers be from zero to 24 and assume that the 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
  166 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
arithmetic mean is at 12 with a standard deviation 
of 4. Let these cards be thrown into a pile and as- 
sume that a sample of twenty numbers be drawn from 
the pile. We should expect the average of the 
twenty numbers to be close to 12 because that is the 
known average of the whole pile, but it is improbable 
that a sample of twenty of the cards would give a 
mean exactly twelve. It would fluctuate by chance 
so that the average of the first sample of twenty num- 
bers might be 11.5 or 13.2, or any number in the gen- 
eral vicinity of 12. 
The purpose of the probable error is to indicate the 
extent to which the average of additional samples of 
twenty numbers might vary from the average that 
we did obtain for the only sample that we did take. 
This expected chance variation to which the average 
is subject is numerically shown by the probable 
error which, for the ‘arithmetic mean, is given by 
the formula 
670 
Up 
in which o is the standard deviation of the distribu- 
tion of the sample, and x is the number of cases in the 
sample, which is twenty. 
In an experiment actually carried out as described 
above the average of the first sample of twenty num- 
bers was 12.4 and the standard deviation of the 
first’sample was 3.21, which gives, for the probable 
error, the value of .48. The mean of the sample, 
with its probable error, is usually written as follows: Probable error of arithmetic mean = 
 
-P-A-G-E-183
  
  The Probable. Error 167 
Mean. = 12.40 + .48. It has various interpretations 
that we shall discuss and examine separately. 
It. will be noticed that the number of cases, n, 
occurs. in the denominator of the formula. This 
agrees with our previous statement that the expected 
chance fluctuations of an arithmetic mean are reduced 
by increasing the number of cases in the sample. 
The standard deviation is in the numerator. If the 
numbers in the pile vary from zero to one million, we 
should of course expect greater fluctuation in the 
average of successive samples of twenty cards than if 
the numbers in the pile range only from zero to ten. 
This fact is consistent with the formula in that the 
standard deviation occurs in the numerator. If the 
variability of the numbers in the sample were in- 
creased, we should expect a greater chance fluctuation 
of the mean. 
The probable error or expected chance fluctuation 
of the mean varies directlyas the standard deviation 
of the sample and inversely with the number of cases. 
In Figure 35 we have a frequency distribution for 
one thousand numbers with an arithmetic mean at 
12 and a standard deviation of 4. The total range is 
from zero to 24. Samples of twenty numbers were 
drawn from the one thousand numbers and their 
means calculated. These means were plotted as 
small dots in the lower part of the diagram. Fifty 
such samples; each with twenty numbers, were drawn 
from the large pile of one thousand numbers. | After 
each sample was drawn, the twenty cards were re- 
placedin, the large» pile.so that each sample was
-P-A-G-E-184
  168 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
always drawn from the full pile of one thousand 
cards. The fifty dots show that the means of the 
samples of twenty numbers do not scatter as much 
as the individual numbers. All the averages range 
between 10 and 15, whereas the original numbers 
range from zero to 24. In other words, if there are a

Table 16. An experimental study of the probable error 
In Table 16 we have the tabulation of records from 
the actual experiment with one thousand numbers 
from which fifty different samples were drawn at 
random with twenty numbers in each sample. In
-P-A-G-E-186
170 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
the first column is listed the order of the successive 
samples as they were drawn. In the second column 
is listed the arithmetic mean of each sample. The 
extent of variation of the average for groups of this 
‘size and for the range of this experiment can be in- 
ferred from the second column. 
The third column gives the standard deviation of 
each sample of twenty numbers. These standard 
deviations hover about 4, more or less, which is also 
the standard deviation of the large pile of numbers 
from which the samples were drawn. This verifies 
empirically that, if a sample be drawn, the stand- 
ard deviation of the sample is comparable with the 
standard deviation of the universe which the samples 
represent. This becomes reasonable if we consider 
the ordinates of the frequency curve of Figure 35. 
The ordinate at 12 is 100, which means that there 
are 100 twelves in the large pile from which the 
samples are drawn. The ordinate at 8 is 61, which 
means that there are 61 eights in the large pile. 
Now, if a single card be drawn from the pile, it is clear 
that the chance of drawing a twelve is 712%, or 74, since 
there are one thousand cards in the pile. The proba- 
bility of drawing an 8 is 7845. In the long run we 
shall have, as the average shape of distribution curve 
for the samples of twenty cards, the same form as 
the distribution curve of the large pile, with the ex- 
ception that since the number of cases is 20 in the 
sample, instead of 1000, we shall have a lower sur- 
face. The area of the surface representing the aver- 
age sample will be 729, of the large. surface which  
-P-A-G-E-187
  
The Probable Error I7I 
represents the whole pile. The probability of draw- 
ing a twelve or an eight for the sample is. exactly 
the same as the probability of drawing a twelve or 
an eight in constructing the large surface. Hence 
the variability of the sample will in general be the 
same, or comparable with, the variability of the 
large surface. The ordinates will all be proportion- 
ally lower to account for the fact that fewer numbers 
are being drawn in the sample. 
In the fourth column we have the probable error 
of the mean of each sample. In the first sample the 
mean is 12.40, the standard deviation of the sample 
is 3.21, and the probable error of the mean is .48. 
The mean is then written as 12.40 + .48, which in- 
dicates a probable error range from 11.92 to 12.88. 
Interpretation of the probable error. We now 
come to the interpretation of the probable error 
range. Just what does itmean?. Once in awhile the 
above statement of the average and its probable error 
is interpreted by saying that the true mean is neces- 
sarily between 11.92 and 12.88. Thisiswrong. The 
true mean of the large pile of cards is 12... The cards 
were so arranged, and the true mean was determined 
to be exactly twelve. In this particular sample the 
true mean does lie between the probable error limits 
11.92 and 12.88. The answer to this question is 
“yes”’ and it is so labeled in column five. In the 
next sample the mean was found to be 13.15 with a 
probable error of .64.. The probable error range for 
that sample is from 12.51 to 13.79, and since the true 
mean is at 12, it is seen that the probable error range
-P-A-G-E-188
172 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
of the mean of the sample as well as the mean itself 
of the sample are entirely beyond the true mean. 
We have the question “‘ Is the true mean inside the 
probable error limits?” This question is answered 
“ves”? 26 times, and “‘no” 24 times. This leads to 
the inference that the true mean of the universe from 
which the samples are drawn may be either inside or 
outside of the probable error range of the sample. In 
fact, the chances are even that the true mean is in- 
side the probable error limits of any single sample. 
But it is important to remember, and this is what the 
student occasionally forgets, that the chances are 
even that the true mean is outside the probable error 
limits of the sample. While the chances are even 
that the true mean is inside the probable error limits, 
the chances are also even that the true mean lies out- 
side of these limits. When we say this, we are deal- 
ing only with the fluctuations in the average that are 
caused by mere chance, and we know nothing what- 
ever, as far as inference from the probable error is 
concerned, regarding any illegitimate or uninten- 
tional loading of the sample which may misrepresent 
the unmeasured total. 
Suppose that we are measuring the stature of ten- 
year-old children. We obtain records of stature for 
twenty ten-year-olds. We calculate the average 
stature for this group and we determine its probable 
error. If the probable error is small, we regard the 
determination of average stature for ten-year-old 
children to be fairly accurate. We must remember, 
nevertheless, that the chances are even that the true
-P-A-G-E-189
  The Probable Error 173 
height of ten-year-old children is outside of the limits 
set by the probable error of the average stature. 
The practical situation is parallel to this experi- 
ment with the fundamental exception that we do not 
know anything at all about the wniverse, all ten-year- 
old children in the city or district where we are work- 
ing. This universe is represented in the experiment 
by the large pile of cards. Under actual working 
conditions in which statistics are applied we know 
nothing about the total that we are trying to measure. 
We only know about the records in one single sample 
which may contain twenty cases, or one hundred 
cases, or several thousand, as the importance of 
the job and available records may dictate. We are 
always working with a sample, just as fruit, or cement, 
or grain is evaluated by samples. If the sample is 
taken out of the carload, or the bag, entirely at ran- 
dom, it will be more or less representative of the 
entire carload, or the whole bag. It will be subject 
to chance variation from one sample to the next, and 
such variation can be predicted as to its extent by 
the probable error formule if the evaluations are 
quantitative. But the sample may have been drawn 
with an intentional or an unintentional bias such as 
would be the case if conditions of exposure to heat, 
light, and moisture in the carload were to affect the 
sample in a way which would not represent the condi- 
tions in the entire car. That would be an uninten- 
tional bias. The top of a fruit basket constitutes a 
sample which is intended to serve as representative of 
the entire basket, and so the consumer learns what is
-P-A-G-E-190
174. The Fundamentals of Statistics 
meant by intentionally loaded samples. These dif- 
ferent kinds of bias have their logical counterparts 
in the samples of statistical work in education and in 
the social sciences. The probable error tells us some- 
thing regarding the reliability of our estimates of a 
total from the relatively small sample by which we 
try to prove something regarding the total. But the 
probable error tells us only about the expected varia- 
tions that are due to mere chance, and. these chance 
variations are very small compared with the mis- 
representations that are brought into statistical work 
by intentional and unintentional bias in the sample. 
About the more serious factors that disturb statis- 
tical validity, the probable error tells us nothing. 
If, instead of knowing all about the large pile of 
cards, we decide to take a sample of twenty cards by 
which to estimate the characteristics of the total, we 
shall have one average for our sample, and we shall be 
obliged to make the best possible estimate of the 
reliability of that average in describing the unmeas- 
ured total. We shall have no means of knowing 
which one of the fifty or more samples it is that we 
have drawn. We may just happen to be working 
with one of the samples that has a probable error 
range entirely outside of the true mean. . The fact 
that the true mean is at twelve is not known because 
in practical statistical work the total is never known. 
All we can do is to determine the average of the par- 
ticular sample with which we are working, calculate 
the probable error of that average, and then state 
that there is an even chance that the true average
-P-A-G-E-191
  The Probable Error 175 
is outside of these probable error limits. Further, we 
give assurance that the still more serious factors that 
might cause a sample to misrepresent the total have 
been avoided not by figuring the probable error but 
by selecting the members of the sample as far as possi- 
ble at random and unaffected by any time and place 
characteristics which are not a part of the definition 
of the total that the findings are supposed to describe. 
Definition of probable error. If we have one 
sample of twenty cards with its average and its prob- 
able error, can we say anything regarding the cor- 
responding facts for the next sample of twenty cards 
that we might draw if opportunity were to present 
itself? For example, can we be fairly sure that the 
average of the next sample that we might draw will 
fall between the probable error limits of the first 
sample that we already have drawn? No. If we 
consult the records in the experiment as shown in the 
table, we shall find that in approximately half of the 
cases the average of the next sample will be inside 
the known probable error limits, and in approxi- 
mately half of the cases the average of the next 
sample falls outside of these limits. Therefore, we 
can say with fair assurance that if the next sample be 
drawn under conditions that are absolutely parallel 
to the conditions obtaining for the first and com- 
pleted sample, a situation that rarely obtains in 
practice, there is an even chance that the average of 
the next sample will be outside of the probable error 
limits that we already have. This principle can be 
verified in the table.
-P-A-G-E-192
  
176 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
The probable error (denoted by P. E. or E.) of a mean 
is a pair of divergencies, lying one above and the other 
below the mean, of which one can say with confidence 
that there 1s an even chance that the true mean lies 
between these limits. This definition of the probable 
error assumes that noted deviations are all due to chance. 
If we desire to specify a range, with more certainty 
that the true value lies within the specified range, 
we may do so by the aid of the following table. The 
chances that the true value lies within the range set 
by + EZ, + 2 E£, etc. are as follows: 
£—the chances are even 
2 E—the chances are 4.5 to I 
3 £—the chances are 21 to I 
4 E—the chances are 142 to I 
5 &—the chances are 1310 to I 
6 £—the chances are 19,200 to I 
7 E—the chances are 420,000 to I 
8 E—the chances are 17,000,000 to 1 
g E—the chances are about 1,000,000,000 to 11 
If we apply these probabilities to the average and 
its probable error for the first sample of twenty cards 
in Table 16, we find that the mean is 12.40, that 
the probable error is .48 and that twice the probable 
error range would be from 11.44 to 13.36. We can 
therefore say that the chances are 4.5 to 1 that the 
true mean is between 11.44 and 13.36. It should be 
clear that the more we extend the range the greater 
will be the probability that the true mean is within it.

  The Probable Error 177 
The difference between the probable error and the 
quartile or median deviation. In Figure 35 we have 
two frequency distributions, one distribution for the 
original separate numbers and one distribution for 
the averages. The small dots represent this latter 
frequency distribution. Each dot represents an 
average of twenty numbers. The spread or varia- 
bility of this distribution is much smaller than the 
variability of the original numbers. The probable 
error of the mean of a single sample is comparable 
with the semi-interquartile range of the distribution 
of averages. One-half of the averages falls within 
the probable error limits, and one-half of them falls 
outside, just as is the case with the quartile devia- 
tions of any distribution. 
The terms probable error and quartile deviation are 
statistically similar, and their numerical values are 
identical, but the terms are used in different ways. 
If we are talking about the spread of a lot of numbers 
that we have actually recorded, we measure the 
known spread by the quartile deviation. If we are 
estimating or predicting, from a single sample, what 
the spread would be, we call the same idea the prob- 
able error. If we have a sample of twenty numbers, 
and if we have calculated the average and its prob- 
able error, we mean by the probable error an estimate 
or prediction of expected variation in the mean if 
additional samples were taken. Now suppose that, 
instead of estimating what the variation would be, 
we actually proceed to take additional samples and 
calculate the mean for each one. Suppose that we
-P-A-G-E-194
178 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
have done this for fifty or one hundred samples. We 
can then plot a frequency distribution of the aver- 
ages. If we do that, the probable error would be 
referred to as the quartile deviation of the distribu- 
tion of averages. The two concepts are identical but 
they are used to designate two different situations. 
If we actually have the distribution, we measure the 
variability and call it the quartile deviation. If we are 
merely estimating what the variability might be, we call 
it the probable error. Both concepts denote the same 
measure. They are both laid off from the best ob- 
tainable mean, and they both include within their 
range one-half of the measures in the distribution. 
Some applications of the probable error formula. 
Under certain conditions the following type of ques- 
tion might arise: What is the probability that the 
true mean is not less than 12? If we have the first 
sample with its mean of 12.40 and if we do not know 
the true mean, we could make an estimate of the 
probability of the true mean being as low as 12. 
Supposedly the value 12 is .40 below the mean we ob- 
tained in the only sample of which we have any 
knowledge. The question is then to determine the 
probability of the true mean for the unmeasured total 
being .40 below the mean that we actually did ob- 
tain in the one sample. The probable error of the 
obtained mean (12.40) is .48 and hence the distance 
.40 can be expressed as a deviation of - =.032. 
If we should plot a frequency curve about 12.40 as 
a mean, with a quartile deviation of .48, we should
-P-A-G-E-195
  
  The Probable Error 179 
have the best possible guess as to what the distribu- 
tion of averages would look like if we were to proceed 
with a lot of additional samples like the one that we 
have actually taken. The true mean about which 
this distribution of averages should be plotted is of 
course not known, but we use the mean of the one 
sample as the mean of the expected distribution of 
averages because it is the only average of which we 
know anything. The chances are even, as we have 
seen, that this obtained average for a single sample 
is above the true mean, and the chances are also 
even that this obtained average is below the true 
mean of the unmeasured total. 
If we imagine this expected distribution of aver- 
ages of additional samples that we might take, and 
if we consider the fact that the one sample already 
available might be any one of the points in that dis- 
tribution, our question of ascertaining the probabil- 
ity that the true mean is not lower than 12 can be 
restated in the following form. What is the propor- 
tion of the area in the distribution of expected aver- 
ages which lies above 12? The point 12 is desig- 
nated as — .83 £. The standard deviation and the 
probable error are always in the following relation: 
P. E. = .67 0. Hence the point 12 is designated on 
the sigma scale as — .56¢. The proportion of the 
entire surface between the mean ordinate and this 
point — .56o0 is 21% and hence the probability of 
the true mean being not less than 12 is .71. The: 
probability that the true mean is less than 12 is there- 
fore .29. It so happens, as we discovered by actu-
-P-A-G-E-196
180 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
ally taking the additional samples that we are here 
guessing about, that the true mean is at 12. 
Another type of problem that involves the use of 
the probable error concept would be the following : 
What is the probability that the true mean does not 
differ from the mean of the sample by more than, let 
us say, .3? We start as before. The only average 
that we know anything about is the average of the 
one sample of twenty cards, which is 12.40. Our 
question can be restated in the following form: 
What is the probability that the true mean of the un- 
measured total lies between 12.40 + .30 or between 
12.10 and 12.70? We imagine again a frequency 
distribution of the averages of the additional samples 
that we might take, similar to the one that we have 
already drawn. We assume that the mean for this 
distribution of averages is at 12.40 because that is the 
only average about which we know anything. The 
probable error of this average is .48 and hence the 
range that we are now interested in can be expressed 
as the range from — .62 EF to + .62 E because the 
deviation .3 is .62 of the probable error of the mean, 
.48. The range thus expressed can be turned into a 
sigma range from — .42. 0 to + .420. The propor- 
tion of the whole surface between these two limits is, 
according to the appropriate tables, 33%. Hence 
the probability is .33, that the true mean is between 
the limits 12.1 and 12.7. Asa matter of fact the true 
mean is 12, but that is of course not known when we 
are making these estimates on the basis of a single 
sample. 
 
-P-A-G-E-197
  The Probable Error 181 
Still another application of the probable error con- 
cept would be to the following question: What is 
the range, above and below the mean of the sample, 
that we must allow in order to be able to say that the 
chances are Io to 1 that the true mean is between 
the limits so given? We shall make the applica- 
tion again to the first sample of twenty cards. The 
mean of that sample is 12.40 and we imagine a dis- 
tribution of averages about this mean. The prob- 
able error of the mean is .48 and that becomes the 
quartile deviation of the expected distribution of 
averages. We now want to find how far we must 
travel from the mean in both directions so that we 
shall include 49 of the surface and leave + of the 
surface above and below these limits. The fraction 
19 is .91 ; half of this will be above the mean, and the 
other half below the mean. We find, from the ap- 
propriate table of fractional areas, that the required 
45% of the distribution lies between the mean ordi- 
nate and the point 1.65 o or 2.46 E. Since the prob- 
able error is .48, we locate the limits of the range as 
2.46 X .48 or 1.18 above and below the obtained 
mean of 12.40. The range required is therefore from 
11.22 to 13.58 and we can say that the chances are 
1o to 1 that the true mean is between these limits. 
Do not forget that, as far as one can know from the 
single sample with which we are working, the chances 
are still 4, that the true mean is outside of this range, 
and we may just happen to have that one sample 
which we estimate would occur once for ten samples 
of the other kind. 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
  182 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
The standard deviation as a measure of reliability. 
We have used, as measures of variability, not only 
the quartile deviation but also the standard devia- 
tion. Both of these measures of actual variability 
may be used for estimating expected variability. 
We find, therefore, in statistics not only the probable 
error but also the standard deviation used to indicate 
expected variation. Since the standard deviation, 
when laid off from the mean in both directions, in- 
cludes two-thirds of the entire surface, and since the 
quartile deviation, or probable error, when so laid off 
from the mean, includes only one-half of the measures, 
it follows that the standard deviation, when used as 
a measure of reliability for an average or other con- 
stant, will indicate a larger range from the obtained 
mean. The interpretation of 12.40 + .72, where the 
.72 indicates the standard deviation of the mean, 
would be that the chances are two to one that the 
true mean is between the limits so given. All of 
the calculations and interpretations of the standard 
deviation as a measure of reliability are similar to 
those of the probable error, with the exception that 
the standard deviation from the mean marks off two- 
thirds of the entire surface, whereas the probable 
error when so laid off includes one-half of the cases. 
The probable error of other statistical constants. 
The probable error, or expected quartile deviation, is 
used as a measure of reliability for other statistical 
constants such as the median, the standard devia- 
tion, and the Pearson correlation coefficient. The 
interpretation is the same, Thus, if we calculate the  
-P-A-G-E-199
  The Probable Error 183 
probable error of a Pearson correlation coefficient, we 
might express it as + .62 + .05, which would mean 
that the chances are even that the true correlation is 
between .57 and .67. 
It will have been seen that the probable error is 
calculated on the assumption that the distribution 
in the sample is normal. When the distribution is 
not normal, and especially when it is noticeably 
asymmetrical, the probable error loses its customary 
significance. As long as the distribution of the 
sample is bell shaped, and not considerably skewed, 
the probable error may be applied to its constants 
with fair assurance of its applicability.

184 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
Summary. We have seen how the quartile devia- 
tion is a measure of the variability or scatter of the 
numbers in a distribution. If, instead of dealing 
with the original numbers and their scatter, we are 
dealing with the scatter of averages of successive 
samples, we can apply the same measures of variabil- 
ity. Ordinarily we have only one sample, which may 
contain twenty numbers or two thousand numbers, as 
the case may be. For that one sample we obtain an 
average. In estimating the reliability or confidence 
that we should attach to this average we imagine that 
additional samples are taken and the average cal- 
culated for each one. Of course, if we have a large 
number of cases in each sample, there will be rela- 
tively small fluctuation in the successive averages. 
If the numbers in each sample cluster very closely 
about the average of the whole sample, we can be 
fairly certain that the successive averages would 
fluctuate less than if the numbers in each sample 
“were found to scatter widely over a long range. 
These two factors, the scatter of the numbers in any 
one sample and the number of cases in the sample, 
go to determine the probable error or reliability of 
the average of the sample. If we actually draw these 
additional samples, as we have done in the experi- 
ment here described, and if we plot the distribution 
of averages, we may actually measure the extent 
to which they scatter by determining the quartile 
deviation of the distribution of averages. If, in- 
stead of actually drawing successive samples and 
actually plotting the scatter of the successive aver-

The Probable Error 185 
ages, we estimate what the fluctuation in successive 
averages would be, on the basis of a single sample, 
then we talk about the expected quartile deviation 
as the probable error. A quartile deviation which is 
not actually measured, but only estimated or pre- 
dicted, is called a probable error. 
Problem 1. The arithmetic mean of a sample is 64.78; its 
standard deviation is 6.34 class intervals; each class interval 
contains .5 scale units. There are 100 cases in the sample. 
1. Determine the probable error of the mean. Of the stand- 
ard deviation. 
2. Determine the standard deviation of the standard devia- 
tion. 
3. What is the probability that the true mean is higher than 
68? That it islessthan 64.78? That it lies between 64 and 65 ? 
4. What range must be specified on both sides of the ob- 
tained mean so that one may say that the probability is as five 
to one that the true mean is within the range? 
5. What is the probability that the true mean does not differ 
from the obtained mean by more than .3? 
6. If 150 additional samples were taken similar to the above. 
sample, and the average calculated for each one, what semi-in- 
terquartile range would you expect for the distribution of the 
additional 150 averages? What would be the expected semi- 
interquartile range of the averages of 300 additional samples with 
the same number of cases in each sample? 
7. Assume that the true mean is at 66. Plot the expected 
distribution of the 150 additional averages. Indicate on the 
chart the location of the average for the above sample. 
Problem 2. Write an explanation of what is meant by the 
standard deviation of the standard deviation. Explain how 
you would arrange an experiment to verify your definition 
empirically. 
Problem 3. The following problem should afford some good 
points for discussion.
-P-A-G-E-202
  
186 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
Suppose that you have determined the average or mean 
stature for a random sample of 50 students from a class of 
500 and that you have calculated the probable error of this 
mean. Suppose, further, that you have calculated the mean 
stature for the 50 tallest men in the class and its probable error. 
Which probable error is the smaller? Can you explain the rea- 
son? 
Problem 4. Assume that two cities, 4 and B, have popu- 
lations of 1,000,000 and 1,000, respectively, and that you have 
drawn a sample of 500 cases from each population to determine 
average stature, age, or any other measurement. Which of the 
two means is the more reliable index of the population that it 
represents? 
Is the mean of a random sample of 500 affected by the size 
of the population from which it is drawn? 
Is the probable error of the mean of the sample affected by 
the size of the population from which it is drawn? 
Is the mean of the sample more reliable if it contains one- 
half of the population which it represents than if it contains only 
zeos of that population? How does this inconsistency come 
about ? 
Is the reliability or trustworthiness of the mean of a sample 
of 500 increased if the sample contains the whole population? 
Is this factor shown by the probable error formula? 
Discuss the limitation in the meaning of the probable error 
for those situations in which the population or universe is re- 
duced to a number comparable with the sample itself.

The Correlation Table 
Relation between variables. Every scientific 
problem is a search for the relationship between vari- 
ables. Every scientific problem can be stated most 
clearly if it is thought of as a search for the nature of 
the relation between two definitely stated variables. 
Very often a scientific problem is felt and stated in 
other terms, but it cannot be so clearly stated in any 
way as when it is thought of as a function by which 
one variable is shown to be dependent upon or re- 
lated to some other variable. Statistical discussion 
sometimes becomes unnecessarily muddled by the 
fact that the investigator has not stated clearly for 
himself just what the several variables are that he 
is studying, and just what the units are by which he 
is measuring and describing them. This cause of fog 
is most serious in scientific discussion that is limited 
to words. When a scientific inquiry is not quantita- 
tive, when it is carried out entirely in terms of lan- 
guage, it becomes especially desirable, for the sake of 
clarity, to state what the variables are, and to state 
in what terms these variables are described. The 
core of the problem is always found to be in the 
nature of the interdependence of the two or more 
variables. When that interdependence or relation- 
ship has been clearly stated and verified, the scien- 
tific problem has been solved.

  188 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
The only exception, a partial one, may be the ini- 
tial stages of scientific work in a virgin field, in which 
scientific labor is largely descriptive. At that stage 
in the exploration of a novel field of facts the curios- 
ity of the investigator is largely directed toward the 
description of unknown things. Sooner or later, 
however, he or his followers reach the more truly 
scientific aspect of inquiry that consists in establish- 
ing dependable relations between the facts found 
or between the new facts and the facts that are al- 
ready known. An archeologist who has just dis- 
covered an Egyptian tomb containing mummies and 
other relics has first the task of describing what he 
has found. Such labor is part of his scientific work, 
but it is only preliminary to his real contributions to 
science in relating the discovered facts to one another 
and relating them in turn to facts of history already 
established. 
A physicist who is investigating the velocity of 
sound through different substances is describing 
them. He is listing a quantitative measure of this 
attribute for each substance. The more truly scien- 
tific aspect of his problem appears when he becomes 
curious about the relation between the velocity of 
sound through the substance and its other known 
characteristics, such as density, chemical ingredients, 
the chemical history of the substance, boiling point, 
electrical conductivity, or shape. He may then dis- 
cover that some of these characteristics have no rela- 
tion whatever to the velocity with which the sub- 
stance conducts sound, while other characteristics do 
 
-P-A-G-E-205
  The Correlation Table 189 
have such a relation. It is in the discovery of such 
interrelations that we have the basis for prediction 
and control which constitute the practical applica- 
tions of science. 
Correlation statistics are concerned with the rela- 
tion of measured variables. We have so far been 
concerned primarily with the characteristics of a 
single variable such as the central tendency and the 
variability. We shall now consider the correspond- 
ing statistical methods for studying the relation be- 
tween variables. 
The logic of the correlation table will be clearer, 
perhaps, if we first note a few examples of scientific 
problems. It is a scientific problem to ascertain the 
strength of different materials of construction. A 
beam will sag if a load is applied to its middle. The 
particular problem may be to determine how much 
it will sag under different applied loads. Here the 
two variables are the load, measured in pounds, and 
the amount of sag, measured in any suitable units of 
length. In this case there is found to be a direct 
relation between the two variables, because as one of 
the variables increases the other one increases also. 
It would also be discovered that the shape or cross 
section of the beam determines the amount of sag. 
In such a problem the two variables might be the 
depth of the beam and the amount of its sag. It is 
found that if the depth of the beam is increased, the 
sag decreases, provided one is experimenting with the 
same load for the different trials. The relation be- 
tween these two variables is therefore inverse. The
-P-A-G-E-206
  
190 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
load would have to be kept constant in the experi- 
ment in order to obtain the true relation between the 
shape of the beam and its sag. As soon as a problem 
is stated in scientific form two or more variables are 
involved and our goal is the establishment of the 
nature of their relation. 
If we are investigating the barometric pressure and 
its usefulness for predicting the weather, we have a 
scientific problem in which one variable is the bar- 
ometric pressure and the other variable is the related 
amount of precipitation, or sunshine, or wind. As 
soon as we state a scientific problem definitely two 
or more variables appear. Our thinking about the 
problem and the technique for solving it becomes 
clearer when we have clearly stated just what our 
variables are. 
A variable is anything that can have a series of 
values, such as height in inches, age in years, sag of 
the beam in millimeters, air pressure in mercury 
centimeters, income in dollars. We have seen that 
variables can be dealt with in statistics conveniently 
by sorting the individual measures into class inter- 
vals. For this purpose we ordinarily select ten or 
twenty or more intervals or successive classifica- 
tions. In handling certain variables it is found that, 
for practical purposes, there are only two class inter- 
vals. If we have the stature of one thousand men, we 
may classify them into two class intervals, those who 
are above the average and those who are below it. 
These two class intervals would be designated tall 
and short. When we see any attribute classified into
-P-A-G-E-207
  
  The Correlation Table 191 
two groups or classes, we may still recognize that the 
attribute is in the nature of a variable and that the 
classification into class intervals is roughly made into 
only two parts instead of the more customary fifteen 
or twenty class intervals. Consider the scientific 
problem of ascertaining whether mosquitoes have 
anything to do with malaria. Here the two variables 
are the frequency of exposure to mosquitoes and the 
incidence of malaria. These are the two variables 
of the problem, both of which might conceivably be 
stated in numerical form. The frequency of ex- 
posure to mosquitoes could be handled by comparing 
two groups of men, one group being exposed fre- 
quently to the bite of mosquitoes and the other group 
being entirely shielded from them. Such an experi- 
ment would show a difference in the incidence of 
malaria and so the relationship between the variables 
would be established, although for experimental pur- 
poses one of the variables would be represented by 
only two of its extreme “ class intervals.” A chemi- 
cal problem of the same type, statistically, would be 
that of identifying a metal by qualitative analysis. 
One of the variables is in that case the amount of the 
metal present in the sample. It is represented in an 
experiment by its two extremes, the absence and the 
definite presence of the metal in the sample. 
Independent and dependent variables. In almost 
every practical situation in which the result of scien- 
tific work is to be used there is a distinction between 
what is known as the independent variable and the 
dependent variable. If we are studying the relation
-P-A-G-E-208
192 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
between barometric pressure and the weather, as 
measured by sunshine, humidity, wind velocity, pre- 
cipitation, there is usually a variable that is known 
and that is used for predicting the variables that 
are unknown. The variable that is ordinarily 
known first is called the independent variable. The 
variable that is being predicted or inferred is called 
the dependent variable because it is somehow depend- 
ent on the facts that are already known. The baro- 
metric pressure would, in weather prediction, be 
called the independent variable and the measure- 
ments of the resulting weather conditions would be 
called the dependent variables. 
If we are studying the relation between the shape 
of a beam and its sag, the shape of the beam would 
be called the independent variable. The sag, being 
dependent on the shape of the beam, is known as the 
dependent variable. The nature and extent of the 
sag depend upon the shape of the beam. 
If a college entrance examination is to be evaluated 
against college scholarship as a criterion, the entrance 
examination mark would be the independent vari- 
able and the college grades would be the dependent 
variable. 
Direct and inverse relationship. If the relation 
between two variables is such that as one of them 
increases the other one increases also, the relation is 
said to be direct or positive. If, on the other hand, 
as one of the variables increases the other one 
decreases, the relation is said to be inverse, or nega- 
tive. If an educational test in arithmetic is given to
-P-A-G-E-209
  The Correlation Table 193 
a group of students, and if the mark in the test con- 
sists in the amount of time consumed to finish a pre- 
determined number of problems, it is clear that the 
longer the time, the greater will be the score which is 
measured in minutes, and the lower will be the arith- 
metical ability of the student. The relation between 
the mark in the test and the trait which it is supposed 
to measure is therefore inverse or negative. If, on 
the other hand, the test score consists in the number 
of problems solved in ten minutes, the marks would 
increase as the abilities of the subjects increase, and 
hence this relation would be direct or positive. 
Degree of relationship. It is possible for two 
variables to be related positively and yet imper- 
fectly. There may be a general tendency for one 
variable to increase as the other one increases and 
yet the relation may not be sufficiently uniform or 
close to make it possible to assert it for each individ- 
ual case. An example is the relation between height 
and weight. In general tall people weigh more than 
short people. There is a direct and positive relation 
between height and weight, but it is not perfect. 
When several relations are being compared, it hap- 
pens frequently that of two relations that are both 
positive and imperfect, one may be closer than the 
other. The degree of relationship is the central topic 
of correlation statistics. We shall describe several 
examples showing various degrees of relationship 
from perfect positive to perfect negative. 
There is an almost perfect relation between the 
weight of a piece of steel and its volume. The weight
-P-A-G-E-210
194. The Fundamentals of Statistics 
is practically proportional to the volume. This re- 
lation is positive and perfect. The relation between 
height and weight is also positive, but it is not nearly 
so close and dependable as the relation between the 
weight and the volume of a piece of steel. The 
height-weight relation is positive, but imperfect. A 
relation that is practically zero is the relation be- 
tween a man’s income and the size of his shoes. If 
there is any relation between these two variables, it 
may be very slightly positive. The relation between 
the cubic weight of a substance and its money value 
is probably zero. The relation between the time 
consumed in doing a piece of work and proficiency in 
doing that work is negative but imperfect. An 
example of a negative relation that is almost perfect 
is the relation between the volume and the pres- 
sure of gas when the temperature is kept constant. 
As one of these. variables increases the other one de- 
creases. 
Relations in the social sciences. The study of 
relationships in the exact sciences is ordinarily made 
in quantitative form, and the methods for doing it are 
so common that they are almost taken for granted 
by physicists, astronomers, engineers, and others who 
are dealing with quantities that can be measured 
accurately. When a physicist has a mass of data 
to be examined, he naturally transfers the records to 
a chart in order to discover new functional relations 
between variables. In the biological and_ social 
sciences these quantitative methods for discovering 
relations are not so generally used because the vari- 
 
-P-A-G-E-211
  
The Correlation Table 195 
ables are not so frequently susceptible of quantita- 
tive measurement. 
With the advancement of any science there appears 
an increasing amount of quantitative work. This is 
becoming evident in several of the biological sciences, 
including psychology. With development, the social 
sciences tend to become biological sciences, and these 
in turn are destined to become exact sciences. 
All the sciences deal with variables. There is, 
however, among the sciences considerable difference 
in the precision with which the variables may be 
isolated for measurement. The physicist is able to 
isolate most of the irrelevant factors or variables. 
He obtains data showing the relation, or absence of 
relation, and the exact nature of the relation. In 
the social and biological sciences it is not possible to 
isolate the irrelevant factors or variables. For ex- 
ample, an economist may be studying, as a scientific 
problem, the relation between density of population 
and urban rent. He can obtain accurate records of 
rent, and he can obtain records of the number of 
people who are working or living in each city block. 
But he is not able to do what the physicist can do in 
the laboratory, namely, to shut out the effect of fac- 
tors that he is not studying. The economist cannot 
regulate for experimental purposes the many other 
factors that partially determine rent, such as trans- 
portation facilities, elevation of ground, proximity to 
shops and parks, prestige of the district, and age of 
the buildings. He must deal with the records as he 
finds them, influenced and partly determined by each
-P-A-G-E-212
  196 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
of many factors, the exact part played by some fac- 
tors being unknown. It is possible to determine 
tendencies in the relations by accumulating a sufh- 
cient number of records, but the charts will show 
considerably more scatter of the data than is found 
in the charting of observations in the exact sciences. 
The correlation methods in statistical work have 
been developed to facilitate the study of relations 
between variables where the records show consider- 
able scatter. The methods that are used in the exact 
sciences are slightly different in appearance but they 
can be shown to be mathematically identical. Thus 
the physicist describes his data by means of an equa- 
tion, the constants of which have been determined 
by the method of least squares. The economist and 
the psychologist describe their data by means of a 
regression equation and a correlation table. It can 
be shown that the equations are absolutely identical, 
although the routine methods of presentation are 
slightly different on account of differences in the 
customary amount of scatter that is found in the ob- 
servations of the respective sciences. 
The scatter diagram. The scatter diagram is a 
chart for showing graphically the relation between 
two variables. The scatter diagram shows graphi- 
cally not only the presence or absence of relationship, 
but it also enables one to judge by inspection the 
degree of relation between the two variables plotted. 
In Figure 36 there are five scatter diagrams showing 
the appearance of these diagrams for different degrees 
of relationship. In Part r we have a scatter diagram
-P-A-G-E-213
aoe patent tFigps The Correlation Table 197 
showing a perfect positive relation between two vari- 
ables such as the volume and weight of pieces of 
steel. Every member of the group is represented by 
a point in the scatter diagram. The members of the 
group may be persons whose stature, weight, intel- 
ligence, or salary are being plotted, or the members 
may be any material things about which two vari- 
ables are being studied, such as the pressure and 
volume of a quantity of gas, in which case the pairs of 
observations of the same quantity of gas would con- 
stitute the members of the statistical group. If the

relation between rents and density of population is 
being studied, the members of the statistical group 
would be the sections or city blocks or the buildings, 
for each one of which two variables or facts are noted. 
Every member of the group is represented by a point 
on the scatter diagram. 
Every point on the scatter diagram tells two facts. 
The distance of the point from the horizontal base 
line of the chart tells one fact, the measurement of 
one of the variables. The distance of the point from 
the left vertical edge of the chart shows the second 
fact, the measurement of the second variable. Some-  
-P-A-G-E-214
198 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
times it is not feasible to start the measurements on 
the chart with zero. In that case the two facts are 
to be read off from the two scales of the chart. 
In Part 1 of Figure 36 we have the x-variable in- 
dicated on the base line running from left to right, 
from low values to high values. The y-variable is 
indicated on the vertical axis, running up on the chart 
from low values to high values. It can be seen at a 
glance on this chart that as the values of x increase 
the values of y also increase by a strictly proportional 
amount. Therelation is therefore perfect and positive. 
In Part 2 of the same figure we have a scatter dia- 
gram with twelve paired observations for a relation 
that is positive but imperfect. It is clear by inspec- 
tion of Part 2 that as the values of x increase the 
values of y tend to increase in general, but the in- 
crease in y is not for every observation strictly propor- 
tional to the increase in x. Thus there are two ob- 
servations which indicate different values for ¥ at the 
lowest value of x, and there are similarly two differ- 
ent values for y at the highest value of x. This shows 
that the relation is not absolutely dependable and 
exact, but the average y-value for the six highest 
x-readings is higher than the average y-value for the 
six lowest x-readings. 
In Part 3 we have a scatter diagram which shows 
entire absence of relation between two variables. 
Here we see that the average y-value for the six 
highest x-values is about the same as the average 
y-value for the six lowest x-values. To change the 
value of one of these variables does not have any effect
-P-A-G-E-215
  The Correlation Table 199, 
on the other variable even if we consider the general 
tendency. The relation is said to be zero or absent. 
In Part 4 of the same figure we have a scatter 
diagram for a relation that is imperfect and negative. 
It is negative because as we increase the values of 
x the values of y tend to decrease. Note that the 
average y-value of the six highest x-values is lower 
than the average y-value of the six lowest x-values. 
As one of these variables increases the other one 
decreases. An example would be the number of 
arithmetic problems solved per hour and the average 
time per problem. As one of these variables, the 
number of problems, increases, the other variable, 
time per problem, decreases. The relation is nega- 
tive. In the scatter diagram of Part 4 the relation 
is imperfect. 
In Part 5 of the same figure we have a scatter 
diagram of a relation that is perfect and negative. 
As one of the variables increases the other one de- 
creases and the relation is such that the changes in 
the two variables are strictly proportional to each 
other. A relation may be perfect even though the 
changes in the two variables are different. One of 
the variables may have numerical changes covering 
hundreds of its scale while the other variable has 
changes covering only tenths of its scale. . There is 
no necessary relation in the magnitude of the two 
scales, but in a perfect relation the changes are 
strictly proportional throughout the entire range for 
which paired observations have been plotted. 
We have seen in dealing with a single variable that

  The Correlation Table 201 
it is convenient to divide the scale of the variable into 
class intervals for purposes of tabulation. We shall 
do likewise for plotting scatter diagrams. In Fig- 
ure 37 we have a scatter diagram for the relation 
between height and weight of 750 students at Ohio 
State University. Every person in the statistical 
group is represented by a mark in one of the squares. 
Since there are 750 men in the group there are as 
many small marks on the diagram. Every mark 
represents two facts about a student. His weight in 
pounds is indicated by the scale at the left edge of 
the diagram. His stature in inches is indicated by 
the scale along the bottom of the diagram. 
In Figure 38 we have the corresponding data for 
the relation between the height and the weight of 750 
students plotted in the form of a correlation table. 
The only difference between a scatter diagram and a 
correlation table is that in the scatter diagram we 
have a point for every case, whereas in the correla- 
tion table we have the total frequency in each box 
listed in numerical form. Otherwise the scatter dia- 
gram and the correlation table are identical. It is of 
course necessary to prepare something corresponding 
to the scatter diagram in order to be able to count up 
the frequencies in the boxes of the diagram. 
If we look at the correlation table in Figure 38, we 
find that the average weight tends to increase from 
any class interval in height to the next higher class 
interval in height. This is apparent by the diagonal 
arrangement of the frequencies. The upper left 
corner and the lower right corner of the diagram are

relatively empty, whereas the diagonal area from the 
lower left corner to the upper right corner of the dia- 
gram is relatively well filled. The extent to which 
the marks or frequencies in the diagram cluster 
around a diagonal line indicates roughly the degree 
of relationship between the two variables. 
If there were no relation between the two variables, 
the diagram would have an entirely different appear- 
ance. If, for example, we should tabulate the rela- 
tion between each man’s income and the size of his 
shoes, we should probably find no noticeable relation. 
The frequencies for income would come as high in 
the diagram opposite the small sizes of shoes as 
opposite the large sizes of shoes. The points or fre- 
quencies in the diagram would cluster around the 
center and the four corners of the diagram would be 
about equally filled. There would be no noticeable 
diagonal arrangement and consequently no relation 
would be observed. 
For many practical purposes it is sufficient to plot 
the correlation table or the scatter diagram and to 
analyze directly from it the desired information 
without calculating the correlation coefficients and 
the regression coefficients. From the correlation 
table one may extract all the information necessary 
for plotting bar diagrams, curves, and other charts, 
and for tables of averages. It should be borne in 
mind, however, that the correlation table gives all the 
facts about the relation between two variables, and 
that all other forms of representing statistical results 
give only a part of the evidence.

Chapter Twenty-three 
The Pearson Correlation Coefficient 
The correlation coefficient is a pure number, a con- 
stant which indicates the degree of relation between 
two variables. It varies from + 1 to — 1. When 
the relation is perfect and positive, the correlation 
coefficient is + 1. When the relation is perfect but 
inverse, the correlation coefficient is — 1. When 
there is no relation whatever between the two vari- 
ables, the coefficient is zero. Other values of the 
coefficient indicate intermediate degrees of relation. 
Thus a coefficient of + .8 indicates that the points 
on the scatter diagram cluster rather closely about a 
diagonal line across the diagram, whereas a coefficient 
of + .3 indicates that the points scatter more from 
the diagonal tendency although the relation is still 
noticeable. The degree of relation between height 
and weight is approximately + .5.!_ It is apparent, 
then, that the correlation coefficient is only a numeri- 
cal way of describing the scatter diagram, although 
the diagram gives more information than can be 
found from the single numerical value of the coeffi- 
cient. When a great number of relations are being 
studied, the correlation coefficients serve as abbrevia- 
tions or indices of the degree of relation from which 
1 Students occasionally make the mistake of calling a correlation coefficient 
a per cent. A correlation of + .5 is called “five tenths” or “fifty.” It is 
not a per cent. It is a pure number. 
205
-P-A-G-E-222
  206 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
the experienced statistician can visualize the diagram, 
more or less roughly. If one has the option of seeing 
the scatter diagram and the correlation coefficient, 
one would of course choose the diagram because the 
coefficient can be found from the diagram but the 
diagram cannot be at all accurately constructed from 
the coefficient. The diagram gives more information 
than the coefficient, but when many relations are to 
be compared, the coefficient serves as an objective 
and impartial measure of the degree of relation. 
The Pearson coefficient of correlation is usually 
found by the following formula: 
Be zxy : 
NEE, 10, 
in which 
x = the deviation of the x-values from the mean 
of x 
y = the deviation of the y-values from the mean 
of y 
n = the number of cases in the diagram 
the standard deviation of X 
the standard deviation of Y 
r =the Pearson coefficient of correlation 
es Hell 
It is apparent that, in order to calculate the coeffi- 
cient from this formula, it is necessary to determine 
the product of the xy deviations for each point, the 
number of cases, and the two standard deviations. 
It is good practice for the beginner to calculate the 
correlation coefficient for a diagram of about fifty 
cases with the actual deviations from the mean with-
-P-A-G-E-223
The Pearson Correlation Coefficient 207 
out using an arbitrary origin, and to do likewise for 
the two standard deviations. In actual practice, 
however, it is convenient to use a data sheet specially 
prepared for the calculation of the coefficient. The 
purpose of a data sheet is to facilitate the computa- 
tions and to provide a definite space on the sheet 
for each sum or product. 
The correlation coefficient can be calculated with- 
out using the deviations from the means.‘ The for- 
mula often leads to unusually large numbers which 
are awkward to handle. They may be corrected 
by using equivalent scales instead of the original 
X and Y numbers. The formula is as follows: 
=(XY) —n-m,+-m, 
V3(X2) — n- m2 - V3?) — n- m2? 
in which m, = mean of the x-values 
m, = mean of the y-values         
It is well to take into consideration the several 
factors that influence the size of the correlation 
coefficient. If the observations are themselves in- 
accurate, it is of course evident that the correlation 
coefficient may be lower than it would be if the obser- 
vations were accurate. 
It sometimes happens that two variables are re- 
lated through a common third variable which, if not 
controlled or kept constant, plays havoc with the 
1 For a more detailed description, see L. L. Thurstone, “A method of cal- 
culating the Pearson Correlation Coefficient without the use of deviations,” 
Psychological Bulletin, January, 1917. This formula is sometimes referred to 
as Ayre’s formula. He published it several years later.

208 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
correlation table. ‘Thus if we should plot a correla- 
tion table for the relation between stature of children 
and their marks in an examination in arithmetic, we 
should find a low positive relation. We should find 
a relation between these two variables but it would 
not be close. The correlation would be positive but 
low. The reason for the positive correlation would 
be the fact that we had omitted to consider the 
age, which is related to stature. If we should plot a 
correlation table between the same two variables, 
namely, stature and the marks in the arithmetic 
" examination for a group of children who are all of the 
same age, then the coefficient would probably be 
zero. The reason for this shift in the correlation 
coefficient is that in one case we keep a third vari- 
able, the chronological age, constant, whereas in the 
other case we allow it to enter the experiment un- 
controlled. 
Another factor that influences the size of the cor- 
relation coefficient is the linearity of the regression. 
If the line or diagonal tendency on the diagram is 
straight, or if it can be considered to be straight for 
practical purposes, the coefficient will be higher than 
if the diagonal tendency of the points on the scatter 
diagram fall in a curved line. For scatter diagrams 
of the latter sort the so-called Eta coefficient + should 
be determined, although it has the disadvantage that 
it is markedly affected by the size of the class interval 
chosen. 
1 For a discussion of the Eta coefficient or correlation ratio, see G. U. Yule, 
“An Introduction to the Theory of Statistics,” Chapter X.
-P-A-G-E-225
    
The Pearson Correlation Coefficient 209 
Still another factor that causes a low correlation 
coefficient is the restriction in the range of the vari- 
ables. Suppose that we are plotting a correlation 
table between stature and age of children, and that 
we include in the table ages from zero to twenty. 
The relation will then be quite prominent. It will 
be clear at a glance that the older children are taller 
on the average than very young children. But now 
suppose that we restrict the range of the age on the 
correlation table to the limits 10 to 12 years. We 
shall then have no children recorded on the correla- 
tion table who are younger than 1o nor older than 12. 
The relation between stature and age, when age is 
restricted to a short piece of its total range, will be 
very low. If we divide the range of two years into 
twenty-four class intervals of one month each, and if 
we plot the corresponding statures to any suitable 
scale, we shall have a correlation table showing a low 
degree of relationship. One should always be on the 
lookout for this factor in judging correlations and 
correlation tables. For example, it is a matter of 
universal observation that the correlations between 
intelligence tests for college students and their 
scholastic standing are lower than the coefficients 
found in the high schools and the grade schools. 
The primary reason for this is probably that the col- 
lege students represent, on the average, a selected 
group with a restricted range of mentality toward 
the upper end of the scale. If we should give an 
intelligence test to ten thousand people of the general 
population, as in the draft army, and then determine  
-P-A-G-E-226
  210 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
what they could do in college, we should find a strik- 
ingly high coefficient of correlation because the lower 
end of the intelligence test scale would all be failures, 
including the total illiterates. 
The amount of confidence that we give to coeffi- 
cients of correlation should also be determined by the 
number of cases represented in the table. If the 
number of cases is small, such as twenty or thirty, 
and if the coefficient is relatively low, we should not 
place much confidence in the exact determination of 
the degree of relationship. The fact of presence or 
absence of relation may be fairly safely judged from 
a small number of cases, but the exact degree of rela- 
tion should not be inferred unless the number of 
cases in the diagram is several hundred or several 
thousand. The degree of confidence to be placed in 
a correlation coefficient can be stated numerically in 
the form of a probable error which may either be cal- 
culated or determined from statistical tables. 
The regression lines. Suppose that we know a 
man’s stature to be 70 inches and that we want to 
guess his weight on the basis of a correlation table 
such as Figure 38. The best possible guess that we 
can give is the average weight of all the men who are 
70 inches tall. We should then turn to the correla- 
tion table and determine the average weight of the 
men represented in the column for a stature of 70. 
There are 87 cases in that column and their average 
weight is about 150 pounds. We should therefore 
give 150 as the most intelligent guess of the weight of 
men who are 70 inches tall. If we should do this for 
 
-P-A-G-E-227
  The Pearson Correlation Coefficient 211 
every vertical column on the diagram, we could plot 
a line connecting the averages of the columns. This 
line, or its equivalent best fitting straight line, is 
known as the regression of weight on stature, or the 
regression of y on x. Such a chart or line would 
enable us to make a prediction or an intelligent guess 
as to the weight of men when their stature is known, 
and our guess would be based solely on the known 
rough relation between these two variables. 
Now suppose that the problem were reversed. 
We have discovered that men who are 70 inches 
tall weigh on the average 150 pounds. This may be 
taken as the normal or average weight for men of 
given stature. But now suppose that we want to 
guess the stature of a man who is known to weigh 
150 pounds. We are not justified in saying that his 
stature would probably be 7o inches. The procedure 
would then be to determine the average stature of all 
the men who weigh 150 pounds. This is done by 
consulting the horizontal row in the correlation table 
representing the distribution of stature for men who 
weigh 150 pounds. There are 49 men represented in 
that class and their average stature is about 69 
inches. We find therefore that the average weight 
for men who are 70 inches tall is about 150 pounds, 
but it does not follow that the average stature for 
men who weigh 150 pounds is 70 inches. In one 
case we are determining the average of a vertical 
column of entries in the correlation table, and in the 
other case we are determining the average of a hori- 
zontal row of entries in the table.
-P-A-G-E-228
  202 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
A line or curve may be drawn to represent the 
average of the rows and such a line would be called 
the regression of height on weight, or the regression of 
x on y. It is very essential to keep in mind which 
of the two regressions one is using in preparing statis- 
tical tables, and not to assume that the tables can 
be read in both directions. If x is known, a certain 
value should be given as the normal or average y, but 
if that same value of y is known, it would not be asso- 
ciated with the same value of x. 
The regression equations are as follows: 
Regression y on x (predicting y when x is known) 
ye—a7 Gu 
2 
Regression x on y (predicting « when y is known) 
wary 
oy 
In both of these equations, « and y denote deviations 
from the respective means. 
Ordinarily we make predictions on the basis of the 
actual X and Y values, such as stature and weight, 
rather than on the basis of deviations of these meas- 
ures from their means. The following forms will 
therefore be found useful in practical work:

Regression X on Y (predicting X when Y is known)

The Pearson Correlation Coefficient 213 
In both of these equations, X and Y denote the 
actual original values of the two variables, and not 
the deviations from their respective means. 
Problem 1. Plot a correlation table for any two variables and 
determine its correlation coefficient. Plot another correlation 
table representing only one-fifth of the total range of one of the 
variables. Calculate the coefficient for this new correlation 
table and show that its coefficient is smaller and why. 
Problem 2. The following problem will probably afford op- 
portunity for discussion of the regression lines. Assume that 
the average mental age of twelve-year-old children is twelve. 
Show why it is that the average age of children who have a 
mental age of twelve is not twelve. 
Problem 3. Make a table of the proper weight for each 
stature as shown on any penny-in-the-slot scales. Determine 
your weight. Do these facts represent the regression of height 
on weight, or the regression of weight on height? Make some 
erroneous statements that could be made by a person who 
draws inferences from your table of height and weight without 
understanding what is meant by the regression lines.

The Calculation of the Pearson Coefficient! 
If one does not calculate the correlation coefficient 
often, one may find it necessary to return to the text- 
books in order to relearn the method of computation. 
That should not be necessary if a data sheet is avail- 
able with direct instructions for the computation 
separated from the discussion of the logic of the 
correlation table. I find that even those who calcu- 
late these coefficients frequently spread their calcula- 
tions over many slips of paper and compute the 
various parts in more or less random order. It is 
almost impossible to check calculations that are not 
systematically arranged. 
The correlation data sheet which I have been using 
is of double letter size so that it can be folded once 
and filed with letter-size papers and reports. I have 
arranged the sheet so that it should not be necessary 
to do any scribbling on loose slips of paper. A small 
space is provided for the scribbling that may be 
necessary. All items in the calculation, such as 
frequencies at the intersections of the arrays, sums, 
squares, and other numbers, belong in definite spaces 
on the data sheet. If one has occasion to return to 
the calculations, he can readily find what he is

looking for. The correlation data sheet is a labor- 
saving device. 
Instructions for the use of the data sheet. In 
order to make these instructions brief and easily read 
I have indicated several of the columns by the num- 
bers at the top of the sheet. (See Figure 38.) These 
numbers do not occur on the regular data sheet. 
They are inserted here for the purpose of these 
instructions only. The horizontal rows are labeled 
by letters for the same purpose. The rows and col- 
umns are known collectively as arrays. When I 
refer in these instructions to a certain square on the 
data sheet, I shall refer to it by the number of the 
column and the letter of the row which intersect in 
a square. Thus C—3 refers to a square on the sam- 
ple data sheet which contains the figure 7. The sam- 
ple set of data is drawn from West’s textbook in 
statistics. ; 
1. Select any suitable class interval for the x-vari- 
able. On the data sheet these intervals are unity. 
2. Record these class intervals in row 4 as shown 
(61, 62, etc.). Always arrange the small numbers to 
the left and the large numbers to the right. 
3. Row B contains the upper class limits for the 
class intervals, which in the case of the example are 
61.9, 62.9, etc. Row A contains, then, the lower 
class limit, and row B the upper class limit. 
4. Select a suitable class interval for the y-vari- 
able. In the example this is five. Record the lower

  216 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
and upper class limits for these class intervals in 
columns 1 and 2 respectively. By tabulating both 
the upper and the lower class limits for each class 
interval one is sure that the actual range for each 
class interval is indicated on the data sheet. This 
serves to prevent confusion as to the square in which 
any particular frequency is to be recorded. Arrange 
the small numbers at the bottom and the large num- 
bers at the top, as shown. 
5. Record the frequencies in the squares of the 
correlation table. In the example these range be- 
tween rows D and K and between columns 3 and 7. 
6. Record in row L the sums of the frequencies 
in the vertical columns of the correlation table. 
7. Record in column 8 the sums of the frequencies 
in the rows of the correlation table. 
8. Add the numbers in the row L and record at 
N (N = _ ) in the table of sums in the upper right- 
hand corner of the data sheet. In the example this 
sum is 750. This is the total number of cases. 
g. Add the numbers in column 8 and see if the 
sum agrees with the N just recorded in the table of 
sums. It should be the same number. 
10. Select any class interval as an arbitrary origin 
for the x-variable. In the example this is chosen at 
column 5. This arbitrary origin may be taken at any 
class interval but it reduces the arithmetical labor to 
choose it as close to the mean as possible. This 
should be done by inspection because it does not pay 
to calculate the mean specially for this purpose. 
Draw a blue pencil line or a wavy pencil line through
-P-A-G-E-233
  The Calculation of the Pearson Coefficient 217 
column 5 so as to mark off clearly at all parts of 
the correlation table the position of the arbitrary 
origin. 
11. Do likewise for the y-variable. The arbitrary 
origin for the y-variable has been chosen at row G. 
This row is marked similarly to the corresponding 
class interval in x (column 5). ‘The correlation table 
is now divided by the blue pencil lines into four 
quadrants. It should be remembered that these 
quadrants are marked off from the two assumed 
means and are not to be confused with the quadrants 
which would be marked off from the true means. 
12. Record a zero at M—s. Record the succes- 
sive class intervals on each side of this zero, as shown 
in the rest of row M. Do likewise in row C. 
13. Record in row N the products fx. These are 
merely the products of the two rows immediately 
above NV. ; 
14. Record in row P the products fx. These are 
the products of the two rows immediately above P. 
This is easily verified by inspecting the sample data 
sheet. 
15. Record a zero at G—g9. Record above and 
below this the ascending and descending orders of 
class intervals, as shown in the rest of column 9. 
16. Record the products fy in column to. These 
are the products of the two columns immediately to 
the left of column ro. 
17. Record the products fy? in column 11. The 
details of these calculations should be evident from 
the data sheet.

218 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
18. Inrow D you will find the numbers 3, 2, 2, 1 to 
the right of the assumed origin. Immediately above 
these numbers in row C you will find the numbers 
I, 2, 3, 4. Each of the numbers in row D is to be 
multiplied by the number immediately above it in 
zow C. These numbers are to be summed up thus: 
(x1) + (2X2) +23) +0 X4) = 17 The number 17 is recorded at D—13. Thesums that 
are obtained on the right-hand side of the assumed 
origin (column 5) are recorded in column 13. The 
sums similarly obtained on the left-hand side of the 
origin are recorded in column 12. This verbal state- 
ment will be clearer by noting visually on the data 
sheet the manner of the calculation. 
This operation is repeated for each row with a 
separate sum for the right-hand side and for the left- 
hand side. For example: In row F we have the 
following sums : 
efteside :4 (3. 1) + @.X 2)'+1@ 3) = 13 
Right side: (10 X 1) + (12 X 2) + (41 X 3) 
et X15) eae Ce x6) as 
These sums, 13 and 78, are recorded in the squares 
F-12 and F ~13 respectively. 
This operation can be performed with less effort on 
a comptometer or any other key-driven calculating 
machine. It is done as follows: 
Consider the left side of row F. Set the finger on 
the 1-key at the lower right end of the machine. 
This key represents the deviation 1 of the C-row. 
Punch the key three times to represent the frequency
-P-A-G-E-235
  The Calculation of the Pearson Coefficient 219 
of three. Move the finger to key 2 immediately 
above your present location on the machine. Punch 
it twice to represent the frequency of two. Move 
the finger up one step again and punch the new key 
twice to represent the frequency of two. The sum 
of 13 is now on the machine without any further 
mental effort. This work can be done without look- 
ing at the machine, so that one may keep one’s eyes 
on the correlation table. 
Now consider the right side of row F. Place the 
finger on the 1-key at the lower right end of the ma- 
chine. This key may be punched ten times or the 
key to its left may be punched once to represent the 
frequency of ten. Move the finger up one step on 
the machine. Punch this key twelve times or punch 
it twice and the key to its left once to represent the 
frequency of twelve. Move the finger up one step 
on the machine and punch the key eleven times or 
punch it once and the key to its left once. Move the 
finger up two steps on the machine and punch once ; 
move the finger up once more and punch once. The 
sum of 78 is now in the machine and may be recorded 
at F-13. One will readily learn to move the finger 
one step at a time on the machine without looking 
at it even though he may not know more about the 
calculating machine: In this way the task is ren- 
dered easy even for a novice. 
19. The difference between the two numbers 13 
and 78 which were recorded at F—12 and at F—13 is 
65. This number 65 is recorded at F-15. The 
same operation is carried out for all the figures in
-P-A-G-E-236
  220 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
columns 12 and 13. Their differences are recorded 
in columns 14 and 15. If the number in the 12-col- 
umn is larger than the adjacent number in the 
13-column, one records the difference in the 14- 
column. Similarly, if the number in the 13-column 
is larger than the adjacent number in the 12-column, 
the difference is recorded in column 15. One should 
visualize this right-and-left relation in order to re- 
member it. 
20. For the portion of the table above the assumed 
origin of the y-variable (row G) record the products 
of the corresponding numbers in columns g and 14 in 
column 16. Record the products of the correspond- 
ing numbers in columns 9 and 15 in column 17. 
These instructions apply above the assumed origin. 
Below the assumed origin the relation is reversed so 
that the products 9 and 14 are recorded in column 
17 while the products 9 and 15 are recorded in 16. 
The following summary will make matters clearer : 
Columns 
(9) X (14) = (16) 
(9) X (5) = (17) 
(9) X (15) = (16) 
(9) X (14) = (7) 
Another way to recall this is to note that columns 
14 and 15 preserve the same spatial arrangement 
above the assumed origin but that below the origin 
this lateral arrangement is reversed. 
Still another and perhaps the best way to recall 
this is to note that the y-deviations in column 9 are 
positive above the assumed origin and negative be- Above the assumed origin:

low the assumed origin. This comes about from the 
fact that we plot the y-variable in column 1 with the 
high numbers at the top of the column and the small 
numbers at the bottom. If now the positive y-devia- 
tions in column g are multiplied by positive =x in 
column 15, we obtain a positive =xy and record the 
product in column 17. If we multiply the negative 
y-deviations of column g by the positive =x in column 
15, we obtain a negative Sxy and record the product 
in column 16. If we multiply the positive y-devia- 
tions of column g by the negative =x in column 14, we 
obtain a negative xy, which we record in column 16. 
If we multiply the negative y-deviations of column 9 
by the negative =x in column 14, the product xy is 
positive and is recorded in column 17. 
21. We are now ready to extract the sums for the 
final computation of the coefficient. Add the num- 
bers to the left of the assumed origin in row N. 
Record the sum at 2xyeg= in the table of sums 
in the upper right-hand corner. It is 744.

the 2xy. 
The numbers that have been recorded in the table 
of sums may be used for substitution directly into 
the formule that are printed on the data sheet. 
From this point on one proceeds as shown by the 
formule until the coefficient is obtained. In the 
example the correlation coefficient is + .50. 
The work of tabulating the correlation table and 
computing the coefficient for a problem like the one 
in the accompanying example requires about forty to 
sixty minutes after one becomes accustomed to the

  The Calculation of the Pearson Coefficient 223 
sheet. If one is working with the correlation coeffi- 
cients continually, the calculation can be made in 
less time. Verbal description of spatial relations is 
necessarily clumsy. To read these instructions with- 
out consulting the data sheet might give one the 
impression that these calculations are awkward and 
even intricate; but after the necessarily involved 
verbal description has been translated into visual or 
graphic terms, the work can be done by a clerk who 
knows nothing about correlation statistics.

Correlation by Ranks 
When two variables are expressed in terms of their 
ranks and not in terms of their original values or 
scores, one can find only approximately the coeffi- 
cient of correlation between the two variables. The 
product moment, or Pearson, coefficient cannot be 
applied to a set of paired ranks as it is applied to a 
set of paired measurements. When the only data 
available are in the form of ranks, the correlation 
coefficient for the two variables can be found approx- 
imately by formule that differ from the product 
moment formule previously discussed. Sometimes 
the rank formule are preferred even when the avail- 
able data contain the original values or measure- 
ments, but such preference is based on the relative 
ease of calculation of the rank coefficient as com- 
pared with the product moment coefficient. 
. The correlation coefficient for paired ranks is given 
by the following relation : 
6 =(k, — k,)? a6 2a7 
Pee n(n? — 1) n(n? — 1)     
in which p = the rank correlation coefficient

When a set of paired ranks is used for determining 
the correlation coefficient for the two variables, one is 
making the assumption that the distributions of the 
two variables are normal; in many instances this 
is a safe assumption for practical purposes. 
In Table 17 we have an example of the application 
of the rank correlation method. In the first column 
there are listed the twenty-four individuals in the 
group. The constant n is therefore 24. In the 
second and third columns we have the original meas- 
urements in the two variables for each of the twenty- 
four individuals. These variables represent test 
scores. In the fourth column have been listed the 
ranks of the individuals in Test X. For example, 
the individual 20 has a score of 17 in Test X, and 
since that is the lowest score in the whole list, he is 
given an absolute rank of 1, which is recorded in the 
fourth column. Similarly, individual 17 has a score 
of 198 in the same test, and since that is the highest 
score in the group, he is given the highest rank, 
namely, 24, as shown in the fourth column. In fact, 
the fourth column contains the absolute rank of the 
numbers entered in the second column. When there 
are two or more identical scores, it is necessary to 
balance the ranks, as described in previous chapters
-P-A-G-E-242
  226 The Fundamentals of Statistics 
on ranks. In the fifth column we have the absolute 
ranks of the numbers entered in the third column. 
The next step is to list in the d column the differ- 
ences between the ranks as recorded in the fourth 
and fifth columns. For example, the difference be- 
tween ranks 12 and 14 for the first individual is 2 and 
that is recorded in the d column irrespective of sign. 
In the last column the squares of the d column are 
entered. Since it is the squares of the differences in 
rank that enter into the correlation formula, it is 
unnecessary to take any account of the signs of the 
rank differences. 
When the tabulation has been made, the last col- 
umn is summed. The remaining operations consist 
merely in substituting the numerical values in the 
formula, as shown in Table 17. The rank correlation 
coefficient is usually designated p; in this example 
its value is + .58. 
For a distribution which is approximately normal 
one can translate the value of p into an approximate 
value for 7 by the following relation: 
r=2sin™ 64 
In order to facilitate this transposition from p to r 
Table 18 has been prepared. By this table one can 
obtain an approximate estimate of the product 
moment coefficient of correlation from the rank co- 
efficient as calculated from the absolute ranks. 
Problem 1. Calculate the product moment coefficient of 
correlation for the data in Table 17 and compare its value with

The probability curve. The mean is designated zero on the sigma scale. 
The highest ordinate, yo, is at the mean. This ordinate can be computed for 
any particular distribution by the following relation: 
emt Bu 7° Vom 2.50660   
All the other ordinates are expressed as fractions of the mean ordinate depend- 
ing on their distance from the mean ordinate. 
Example. The ordinate which is + 1 ¢ from the mean, either above or below, 
is .606 of the mean ordinate. The ordinate which is 1.34 6 from the mean is 
.407 of the mean ordinate. Verify these facts in the opposite table and also 
in the above figure. 
It is necessary to translate the x-scale into corresponding o values before a 
probability curve can be plotted. Thus, if a score is 65, ¢ = 10, m = 50, the 
score 65 is said to be + 1.5 o on the sigma scale. Its ordinate on the probability 
curve would be .325 of yo.

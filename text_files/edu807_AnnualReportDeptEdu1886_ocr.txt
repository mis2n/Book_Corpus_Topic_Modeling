This shows an increase over that of the preceding year of 
16,889. A mistake occurred in the report madeto Your Ex- _ 
celleney last year, which was corrected in my report of the 
scholastic population of the State to the Comptroller. The 
total scholastic population in report of last, year should have 
been 606,561 instead of 609,028.

CITY SCHOOLS. 
_ The reports of the Superintendents of the cities of the State 
ng having a system’ of public graded schools, show that the work 
is progressing and the schools are doing well. 
AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE. 
Tt is gratifying to note the large increase in the average daily 
attendance. This average daily attendance during the past 
year was 278,276, an increase of 85,873 over the preceding year. 
_ This increase, to some extent, is only apparent, being due to an 
improved system of reports, and to a special effort made to 
secure accurate statistics. These reports are still imperfect, © 
owing to a defect in the law which fails to place in the hands of 
County Superintendents the means of compelling teachers and 
district clerks to compile accurate statistics and to return com- 
plete reports. In some of the schools the records of attendance 
have been negligently kept, and in many instances very meagre 
reports were made. The County Superintendent has, thus, been 
_ unable to procure the data on which to base his report of the 
average attendance, and has been compelled to make an esti- 
mate. This estimate I have found to be usually below the ac- 
 
-P-A-G-E-12
  (12) 
tual attendance. I call attention to the importance of perfect- 
ing the law, so as to enable the county superintendents to en- 
force accurate records and reports. 
After making all allowance, however, for the imperfect rec- 
ords of preceding years, it is evident that the past year has wit- 
nessed a large increase in the, average daily attendance over 
any preceding year since the establishment of our public schools. 
This increase is largely in excess of the increase in scholastic 
population or enrollment. Taken in connection with the in- 
erease in the number of schools and teachers, it affords incon- 
testible evidence of the gratifying fact that our public school 
system is growing in favor with the people, and that the cause 
of popular education is advancing in our State. 
STATE NORMAL INSTITUTES. 
The work of the Normal Institutes during the past summer 
has been eminently successful, and has produced valuable re- 
sults. I regard the Normal Institute as one of the most useful 
appliances of the public school system. It enables the State 
Superintendent to meet the teachers and the people collectively ; 
it calls together the best educational talent of the State; it 
formulates the principles of education, and disseminates en- 
lightened views among the teachers and the public. It has 
done more than any other appliance to elevate education into a 
profession. 
I earnestly repeat my recommendation made in a former re- 
port, that proper legislation be enacted to maintain and perfect 
our institute system. Iam sustained in this recommendation 
by the strong indorsement of the educators and of the people 
from all parts of the State, whose sentiments are expressed in 
resolutions and petitions to the Legislature. These resolutions 
will be found elsewhere in this report. 
During the past summer eight State institutes for white teach- 
ers were held under experienced instructors. Five of these 
were conducted by Capt. W. R. Garrett, at the following places: 
Lebanon, Franklin, Sweetwater, Morristown and Jonesboro. 
He was assisted by Prof. T. C. Karns, Prof. J. J. Tigert, Miss
-P-A-G-E-13
       
  (13), 
ulia A. Doak, Prof. Hanter Nicholson, Prof. 8. V. Wall, Prof. 
J. B. MeFerrin, Prof. J. L. Bachman, Prof. Charles Mason and 
other eminent educators. 
Supt. Frank M. Smith conducted three State Institutes at the 
following places: Collierville, Bolivar and Dresden. He was 
assisted by Prof. A. P. Bourland, Prof. J. L. Lampson, Mrs. 
W. H. Horton and others. 
To all these persons I am greatly indebted for the success of 
the Institute work. I was present at all these institutes, ex- 
cept at Jonesboro, and witnessed the exceilent’ work done. 
  COLORED INSTITUTES. 
Three State Institutes were held for the benefit of colored 
teachers, one at Pulaski, one at Lebanon and one at Memphis. 
These were well attended, and much interest prevailed among 
the teachers in attendance. Dr. R. F. Boyd, of Central Ten- 
nessee College, and Professor Morris, of Fisk University, are 
entitled to much credit for their earnest work in these insti- 
tutes. 
At all the State Institutes the total attendance of teachers 
was about fifteen hundred, and many of our fellow-citizens 
were present. 
COUNTY INSTITUTES, 
The County Institutes, held under authority of the various 
County Superintendents, have also performed a useful work. 
The County Institute does not collect in one body so large an 
assembly of the teachers and of the people as the State Insti- 
tute, and does not throw together educators from different sec- 
tions of the country. Being local in its nature, it affords the — 
opportunity for the teachers of the same locality to compare 
their methods and views, but cannot establish a general system 
of intercommunication between the educators of different local- 
ities; yet in some respects—such as the greater frequency of its 
meetings, the freedom of its exercises, and its more general 
diffusion—it performs an office which the State Institute cannot 
reach. It isan invaluable appliance in the hands of the County 
Superintendent.
-P-A-G-E-14
      (14) 
It gives me great pleasure to call attention to the success of 
these County Institutes during the past year. Many of the 
County Superintendents deserve the highest praise for the en- — 
ergy and ability which they have shown in organizing and con- 
ducting these institutes. The number held during the past 
year was 443, an increase over the preceding year of 94. They 
were attended by 3,309 teachers and by a large number of citi- 
zens. The effect is seen in the steadily increasing skill of the 
teachers, the greater zeal of the directors and the growing pop- 
ularity of the public schools in those counties where they were 
held. Irecommend that legislation be enacted giving power 
to the County Court of each county to make provision for 
maintaining the County Institute. 
STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
This association was founded in 1867. It is composed of 
teachers and friends of education. Gov. Neill 8. Brown was its 
first President. It has been styled “the parent of the public 
school system of Tennessee,” and has contributed in many ways 
to advance the cause of popular education. This body of able 
educators convened in its twenty-second annual session at Shel- 
byville, on the 18th day of August, and remained in session for 
three days. The retiring President, Prof. Eben Alexander, of 
the University of Tennessee, having accepted a position in the 
State of North Carolina, left our State soon after the adjourn- 
ment, much to the regret of many of our teachers and citizens. 
Prof. W. R. Garrett, of Nashville, was elected President, and 
Prof. Frank Goodman Secretary for the present term. A com- 
mittee was appointed to petition the General Assembly on the 
subject of amending the school laws. The action of this com- 
mittee will be submitted to the Legislature in due time. 
THE TEACHERS’ READING CIRCLE. 
At the last meeting of the State Teachers’ Association, the 
_ present Board of Directors for the “ Teachers’ Reading Circle ” 
was continued in office for another term. The report of the 
Secretary, Prof. John LL. Lampson, showed that local reading
-P-A-G-E-15
         
  ( 15 ) 
  les had’ been established in many of the counties. The 
reading circles are doing a useful work, and are creating among 
the teachers a strong desire for study and improvement. 
GRADING THE COUNTRY SCHOOLS. 
The feature of all others which gives the most encouraging 
sign of improvement during the past year, is the increase in 
the number of graded schools. The schools of all the cities, 
and of many of the towns of the State, are now completely 
graded. A considerable number of the country schools are 
graded. Many of the counties are now investigating the sub- 
ject of grading their schools. The counties which have adopted 
this system for their district schools have done so in spite of 
_ the defects of the law. Our school law, indeed, suggests that 
“preference shall be given, under suitable regulations, to graded 
schools,” but strangely enough provides no means to enable a 
“county to establish Such a system of graded schools. Under 
our law the district is the unit. The directors of the district 
_ have entire control over the course of study and general man- 
_ agement of the schools for the district. There is no central 
authority for assimilating or systematizing the county schools. 
In order to grade them upon a uniform plan, it is necessary for 
the directors of the several districts to enter into an agreement, 
by some means, outside of the law. This agreement must be 
_ unanimous, for a single district may defeat it, since no district 
can be coerced. I think an amendment is needed to the law to 
_ enable some central county authority to provide for grading the 
schools upon a uniform plan, prescribing a uniform course of 
study and the general settlement of questions between the sey- 
- eral districts. 
SCHOOL DISTRICTS. 
Under our law the civil district is made the school district, 
except in some counties where.the civil districts have been sub- 
divided into several school districts. In some of these counties 
much confusion prevails as to whose duty it is to change or alter 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
(16) 
  district lines or to form new districts. I recommend that the 
law be so amended as to clearly define what shall constitute a 
school district and who may change the lines. 
PRIMARY INSTRUCTION. 
The greatest defect in the educational system of our State 
has always been the neglect of the primary departments and 
the imperfect methods used in primary instruction. Early in 
my administration I saw the necessity of directing special ef- 
forts to cure this evil. I have called attention to it through 
the institutes, through the school officers, and by every means 
in my power. Much has been done to improve the methods of 
primary instruction, but much remains to be done. In many 
portions of the State the primary work has reached a high 
state of excellence, and I may say that we have many excellent 
primary teachers now at work. Nothing will do more to ben- 
efit the primary work than the establishment of a uniform sys- 
tem of grading the schools. 
GENERAL IMPROVEMENT. 
The statistical tables show a marked improvement in the 
work of the past year over that of any former year in the his- 
tory of the schools. A larger amount of money has been used 
for their support, a larger number of teachers has been em- 
ployed, more school-houses and better school-houses have been 
built, the average daily attendance has largely increased, the — 
methods of instruction have been improved, the number of graded _ 
schools has increased, the attendance of teachers on institutes 
has been larger, the reading circles have increased, the public 
interest has been aroused, the public school system has taken 
a firm place in the confidence and affections of the people. 
COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 
' Much of this general improvement is due to the zeal and 
ability of the County Superintendents. Many of the best edu- 
 
-P-A-G-E-17
  (17) 
cators of the State have given their talents and energy as super- 
intendents of their respective counties, to the work of promoting 
the interests of their county schools. They have done a good 
and quiet work which deserves public acknowledgment and pub- 
lic gratitude.

  REPORT OF INSTITUTES. 
Nasuvitiz, Tenn., December 18th, 1886. 
' Hon. Thomas H. Paine, State Superintendent of Public Instruc- 
tion, Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Strr—In accordance with your instructions, and under 
your general supervision, I conducted five Normal Institutes 
during the summer of 1886. These institutes continued in ses- 
sion, each one week; beginning respectively on the dates and 
at the places designated in your published announcement, viz. : 
Lebanon, June 21; R. McMillan, President; C. L. McCart- 
ney, Secretary. 
Franklin, June 28; Hugh B. Wallace, President; E. M. 
Perkins, Secretary. 
Sweetwater, July 19; James M. Hicks, President; J. CO. 
Hicks, Secretary. 
Morristown, July 26; J. R. Cox, President; Mr. Darlington, 
Secretary. 
Jonesboro, R. L. Patton, President; Charles Mason, Secretary. 
The success of these institutes was largely due to the zeal and 
energy, and to the excellent management of the County Super- 
intendents at the several points where the institutes were lo- 
eated, and to the assiduity of the several secretaries. 
The total attendance was about 450 teachers, and about 4,000 
citizens. The minutes of each institute, together with the rolls 
of teachers in attendance are herewith filed as a part of this 
report. 
The general plan of conducting these institutes was similar to 
that pursued in the institutes of last summer, and described in 
my former report. In accordance with your instructions, we
-P-A-G-E-54
    (54) 
endeavored to make them practical, and we directed the exer- 
cises mainly to primary and common school work. I repeat 
the recommendation made to you in my report of last year, “ to 
give especial attention to the improvement of primary work 
throughout the State.’ The general character of the work is 
so fully described in the several reports of my associates, here- 
with filed as a part of this report, that I deem it unnecessary to 
enlarge on it. 
At all of these institutes I was aided by the invaluable ser- 
vices of Prof. T. C. Karns, of the University of Tennessee. By 
his zealous devotion to the improvement of primary instruction, 
continued through several years, and his clear and attractive 
methods of presenting his subjects, he has rendered to the State 
a public benefit. 
At Lebanon and Franklin, Prof. J. J. Tigert, of Vanderbilt 
University, gave instruction in the methods of teaching English. 
The lectures of Professor Tigert were models of elegant diction. 
It is a source of regret that his eloquent vindication of “ Our 
Mother Tongue” could not reach every teacher of Tennessee. 
At Franklin, Prof. Hunter Nicholson, in the departments of 
Geology and Physiology; and Prof. S. V. Wall, in the depart- 
ment of Arithmetic, rendered valuahle ‘service. I regret that 
-pressing engagements have prevented Professor Wall from re- 
porting a synopsis of his work. I cannot refrain from testifying 
to the usefulness and value of his exercises in the important | 
branch of mathematics. 
I herewith forward the synopsis furnished by Professor Nich- 
olson of his admirable work in Geology and Physiology. No 
synopsis, however, can do justice to the work itself. 
_ At Sweetwater and at Morristown, Prof. J. L. Bachman gave 
an admirable series of lectures on practical instruction in Agri- 
culture, of which I regret that he has not furnished me a syn- 
opsis. 
At Morristown and Jonesboro, Miss Julia A. Doak, of the 
State Normal College, illustrated methods of teaching Arith- 
metic. This work was practical, useful, and beautifully pre- 
sented.
-P-A-G-E-55
            Prof. J. B. McFerrin, at Morristown, handled the subject of 
teaching the English language and the English Grammar in a 
manner which was both scholarly and sensible. 
At Jonesboro, Professor Mason discussed the subject of school 
government. I am glad to be able to furnish you a full outline 
of his work, which will be valuable to the teachers of the State. 
At all the institutes, in addition to the regular corps of in- 
structors above named, valuable assistance was rendered to the 
cause of education by educators in attendance. Some of the 
most beautiful work of the institutes was done by them, and 
methods of instruction were exemplified which gave unmistak- 
able evidence of a high order of ability. 
Our thanks are also due to many of our fellow-citizens and 
to the ladies, who contributed to the work of the institutes by 
essays, addresses, and music. 
Your good judgment in addressing the work of the institutes 
_ to the people as well as to the teachers, was fully vindicated by 
the public interest in education which was everywhere aroused. 
Our public school system must rest upon the solid foundation 
of popular sympathy and support. Nothing has contributed so 
much as these institutes to awaken this popular sympathy. At 
every point resolutions were adopted by the people petitioning 
the General Assembly to enact suitable legislation to make the 
institute system complete and permanent. These resolutions 
_ will be found in the minutes of the different institutes herewith 
©» filed. 
Below you will find synopses of the work of several of my 
associates. Iregret that others have not furnished me with the 
means of reporting their work. My own work in the depart- 
ments of Geography, History, and Map-drawing was similar to 
that of last year. A synopsis of this having been previously 
furnished you, I deem it unnecessary to repeat it. 
Respectfully submitted, 
W. R. Garrett. 
     
-P-A-G-E-56
(56 ) 
To Professor W. R. Garrett, Principal of Institutes : 
With reference to my work with you in the State Teachers’ 
Institutes of Tennessee for the summer of 1886, I beg leave to 
report the following: 
I was employed by Hon. Thomas H. Paine, State Superin- 
tendent of Public Instruction, to assist you in the institutes at 
Lebanon, Franklin, Sweetwater, Morristown, and Jonesboro, 
and I was present at each place. My work consisted in lect- 
ures on best methods for teaching the primary branches. It is 
scarcely necessary for me to attempt a synopsis of all the points 
discussed, as the work was similar to that reported by me for 
the year preceding. Suffice it to say that I endeavored to pre- 
sent sound pedagogical doctrine, and at the same time to make 
my suggestions as practical and as helpful to teachers as possi- 
ble. 
I might perhaps be allowed to touch upon some points not 
strictly within the reach of my special work. In traveling over 
the State and conferring with teachers, I enjoyed an excellent 
opportunity for observing the progress and success of the 
common school system, together with its defects and points 
for amendment. Under the wise management of our able State 
Superintendent, Hon. Thomas H. Paine, much progress has 
been made. Thesystem everywhere has grown in public favor. 
Town schools are being established in all parts of the State. 
Nor are the country schools wanting in decided improvement. 
Good school-houses are being built, and in many places the au- 
thorities are supplying improved desks, maps, charts, and other 
apparatus. Yet, while decided progress has been effected, 
much on the other hand remains to be done. In the first place, 
the lack of funds is, in many sections, quite apparent. When 
schools can run only three or four months in the year, very large 
results cannot be obtained. The law contemplated five months 
of school each year, but the magistrates in many counties evade 
or neglect its enforcement. The least burdensome method of 
securing a sufficient fund would be the enactment of a suitable
-P-A-G-E-57
(7) 
  _ pill giving Federal aid. Much has been said about this meas- 
ure pro and con, and one of the most lamentable features of the 
whole affair is the evident lack among the masses of the people 
to appreciate their own interests. Such aid would about double 
our present fund. 
The summer institutes established by the State Superintend- 
ent have done much for the improvement of teachers. There 
is a general awakening and inquiry as to best methods of in- 
struction and school management. Still the great lack of 
trained teachers is apparent. Many teachers in charge of the 
the public schools are wholly unfit for the business. Money 
paid to incompetent teachers is squandered. Not only so, but 
by it children are cheated out of their rights, and their educa-. 
tion is damaged. The employment of such teachers arises 
largely from the incompetency of directors and county super- 
tendents. Qualified teachers, however, are not always..to be 
found. The public interest demands that they shall be supplied, 
by the State. This is absolutely necessary to the effiviency 
of the schools. No country or State has made a success of 
State schools without provision for the training of teachers. 
The first and readiest method is to provide for efficient summer 
institutes that shall be within easy reach of every teacher. To 
reach all they should be numerous and pernianently fixed, so ” 
that teachers can look forwardgto them and be required to at- 
tend. If one can be held in every county, so much the better. 
It is to Le hoped that the next Legislature will provide a fund 
for this work. These institutes cannot last longer than a few — 
days, or weeks at most. It is important therefore that the in- 
struction shall be the best. It must consist mainly of the the- 
ory and practice of teaching. The State should also provide 
not less than three efficient normal schools to run all the year. 
One should be located in each of the grand divisions of the 
State, and in their course of instruction should be included only — 
such branches as are required to be taught in the common 
schools. They should be devoted entirely to the preparation of 
teachers for most efficient work in the public schools. Thein- 
struction should include both the branches to be taught in the ~ 
State schools and also the theory and practice of teaching. 
The number and convenience of these normal schools should be
-P-A-G-E-58
  (58) 
  - such that after a limited period no teacher not a normal grad- 
uate could be employed to teach in the public schools. Thus 
efficiency, one of the first requisites of success, would be se-’ 
cured. 
A growing tendency to establish graded schools in the smaller 
towns is evident. The addresses delivered on this subject by 
yourself and State Superintendent Paine, are having a most ex- 
cellent effect. The fact is coming to be recognized that the 
cheapest, the best, and the only successful town education for 
the future is in the graded school. From these schools as 
models, great improvement will go out into the country schools. 
They will form the radiating centers from which the educa- 
tional condition of the whole State will be most surely built up. 
A word of caution is necessary to the authorities who are estab- 
lishing graded schools. Too much care cannot be exercised in 
the selection of a superintendent or head principal. It is all- 
essential thet he shall be a man who thoroughly understands 
_ the graded /or- city school system. Educators of the old-school 
line invariably fail. 
County organization is a most important feature of the State 
work, State Superintendent Paine is to be congratulated on 
the success of his work in this line. Several counties have al- 
ready organized. and adopted courses of study. It is to be 
hoped that every county in theState will soon be in an organ- 
 4zed) condition, A regular course of study, and systematic 
arrangement of the work, is just as necessary to the country 
- schools as to those of the city. There is also just the same ne- 
      cessity for close supervision and direction by the superintendent. 
If the county authorites understood their true interests, they 
_ would always employ the best educational talent for the super- 
intendency, and pay for it in proportion. The practice of not 
going outside of the county limits to obtain this talent, when it 
cannot be found at home, seems unwise, unreasonable, and de- 
trimental to the best interests of the school. Cities select their 
superintendents from among the best educators wherever found. 
Why should not counties do the same? 
_ As to the plan of county organization, something like the 
following seems best: The county superintendent is the chief 
  y
-P-A-G-E-59
           (59) 
supervisor and executive officer. He should be a first-class 
practical educator. He furnishes the course of study, and 
should be present at the schools as much as possible to direct 
their management. All the schools of the county should be 
run, as nearly as possible, the same length of time, embracing 
a period of not less than five months. The superintendent 
should have a county organization of his teachers. This may 
be effected in connection with a reading circle, organized for 
improvement in professional knowledge. He also should con- 
duct, at least every summer, a county institute at which all who 
teach should be required to attend. Through constant contact 
he should know thoroughly his teachers and their capacity. 
He should also make a grouping of the teachers of the schools 
of contiguous sections, and organize them into district or sub- 
ordinate institutes. These should meet more frequently. In 
all these meetings practical school work should be considered 
and discussed. The adoption of a regular course of study for 
the county schools, would call for a certificate of graduation for 
all pupils who complete the course. A neatly printed certifi- 
eate, or diploma, stating the course completed by the bearer 
and signed by the county superintendent, the board of directors, 
and the teacher, will be highly prized by the children who com- 
plete the course. If they want to study further they will then 
carry their certificate to the nearest county high-school, and 
upon it be received. High-schools are an important feature of 
the educational system, and should be established wherever the 
density of the population is sufficient. These schools should 
be intermediary between the common school and the college, 
and should prepare student for both college and practical life. 
They will also have a regular course of study, and issue certifi- 
cates to those who complete the course. It would also certain- 
ly add to the interest and efficiency of all the schools for the 
county superintendent to be present at the closing examinations 
and commencement exercises, when he will present the diplomas. 
The occasion should be made one of importance in the neigh- 
borhood. All the pupils would look forward eagerly to the 
time when their honors should arrive. As an assistance to 
county organization it is probable that a State course of study,
-P-A-G-E-60
      (0) 
issued by the State Superintendent, or the State Board of Edu- 
cation, would be very useful. 
T’cannot close my report without a word as to the efficiency and 
success of the work of our State Superintendent, the Honorable 
Thomas H. Paine. As has been fitly expressed, he “ placed the 
Normal School on wheels and rolled it over the State.” As 
nearly as was possible he put normal instruction within reach 
of every teacher of the State. The result has been far-reach- 
ing and lasting for good. It is to be earnestly hoped that the 
next Legislature will place in the hands of the Superintendent 
a fund sufficient to carry on this much needed work more ex- 
tensively, and still more efficiently. All of which is very re- 
spectfully, and very obediently submitted. 
T. C. Karns, 
State Institute Lecturer. 
VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY, 
Nasuviniz, Tenn., December 10th, 1886. 
Hon. Thos. H. Paine, Superintendent of Public Instruction, State 
of Tennessee: 
Dzar Sir—By your appointment I had the honor to be asso- 
ciated with Capt. W. R. Garrett and Prof. T. C. Karns in the 
conduct of State Normal Institutes, at Lebanon and at Franklin, 
in the Middle Tennessee District. Before mentioning my own 
work, upon which I am expected specially to report, I must be 
permitted to testify to the uniform courtesy, the ability, and 
the success of my colleagues in the Normal Faculty. Captain 
Garrett taught me, as well as the teachers present, something 
new by the sand-map of Tennessee, which he manufactured 
and exhibited. In his lectures on History, a subject with which 
I may claim some familiarity, he seemed to me peculiarly happy 
 
-P-A-G-E-61
_ History. :         
     
   in a picturesque and striking grouping of the facts of American 
Prof. T. C. Karns, in a most simple and engaging style, por- 
trayed his methods of elementary, or primary, instruction, and 
illustrated his theories by instructing classes of small children 
in the presence of the teachers assembled. 
Of my own work, you will permit me to say that I lectured — 
daily at Lebanon and at Franklin upon the topic assigned me, _ 
namely, the Hnglish Language. The aim of the first lecture in 
each course was entirely practical. TI called attention tomany _ 
of the more common errors of speech, both in construction and 
in pronunciation, and endeavored to impress upon the teachers 
that they were from their office expected to be patterns and 
standards for the circles in which they moved. It was pointed 
out that a very little care, coupled with daily attention to the 
style of the best authors and a judicious use of the Dictionary, 
would suffice to make any person of average intelligence an ac- 
curate user of the best English. The next lecture proceeded to- 
a survey of the historical elements of the language, and aimed 
to beget in the teachers a desire to know more of our mother- 
tongue than is contained in the grammars commonly used. | 
After this I endeavored to show how much English Grammar 
had suttered by the attempt to force it into the classic moulds 
of the highly inflected tongues of Greece and Rome. I pointed 
out the rarity of inflectional forms in English, and called atten- 
tion to the decay and disuse of those which the language still 
retains. I am encouraged to believe that I was in some degree 
successful in inspiring the teachers with a keener and more 
critical appreciation of English, and with a desire to study the 
language after proper methods. Such at least was the testi- 
mony very kindly given by many of those who heard the lect- 
ures. 
        
I trust that this report of my work is sufficiently explicit. 
To Captain Garrett, the Chairman of our faculty, will fall the — 
duty of giving an account of the Institutes as a whole. But it ~ 
will not be improper for me to add that I was greatly impressed 
with the utility of these gatherings. Both at Lebanon and at 
Franklin the attendance of teachers was very large and their 
 
-P-A-G-E-62
  ( 62.) 
interest most manifest. Moreover, the whole community was 
stirred, and treated the officers of the Institute as honored 
guests. I hope I do not trespass beyond my province in ex- 
pressing the hope that the Legislature now in session will make 
such an appropriation for the support of these State Institutes 
as will secure a liberal supplementary donation from the cus- 
todians of the Peabody Educational Fund. It would be a great 
misfortune to the best educational interests of the State of Ten- 
nessee should the failure to make an appropriation operate the 
suspension of these State Institutes. 
In conclusion, allow me to recognize your own efficient ser- 
vices at both of the Institutes attended by me. The addresses 
delivered by the State Superintendent were greatly appreciated 
by all, and contributed no little to the success of the Institutes. 
I remain, sir, yours very respectfully, 
Jno. J. TrcErt. 
Capt. W. R. Garrett, President of the Tennessee State Normal In- 
stitutes: 
In regard to my work in Arithmetic, in the institutes held at 
Morristown and Jonesboro. The work was confined mostly to 
the grammar-school grades. I endeavored to teach by illustra- 
tion how the principle in the rule might be taught before the 
- rule. Teach the principle and make the class deduce the rule 
    for themselves. As a man’s education does not depend upon 
x the amount of objective knowledge he possesses ; but upon his 
ability to think accurately. This accurate thought must be 
taught in arithmetical analysis. I showed the teachers, by: a 
number of illustrations, how they might make the subject of 
denominate numbers and percentage entertaining and practical 
to the class. These illustrations were measurements of the 
_ school-room and furniture, the showing and explanation of 
post-office orders, checks, bonds, etc. 
Respectfully, 
Jutta A. Doak.

  HOW TO TEACH GEOLOGY AND PHYSIOLOGY. 
The topics assigned me in our programme, Geology and Phy- 
siology, are so broad and at the same time so intricate in their 
details, that it were unwise to attempt to discuss them, except 
in their broadest outlines, and as such discussion cannot be of 
much practical value, I prefer to occupy the greater part of the 
time allotted me to a discussion of “ How to Study and How to 
- Teach Geology and Physiology.” 
T recognize a clear and broad distinction between the methods 
of studying, or acquisition, and of teaching or imparting. In 
studying or investigating any subject originally, the natural 
method is by induction. On the other hand, when once a sub- 
ject has been studied out, the relations of its parts determined, 
and the laws that give rise to and govern those relations ascer- 
tained, then the Deductive or Synthetic method of presenting 
the subject to others comes to the Natural method. It is essen- 
tial that this distinction be clearly comprehended and kept con- 
_ stantly in mind. All the more so since what is now called “ the 
New Education,” is giving such prominence to the Analytic 
_ or Inductive methods, that there is danger that the not less val- 
uable Synthetic or Deductive method may be neglected. The 
truth is the two are but halves of one whole. The two taken 
together make up the Scientific method of which I shall have 
more to say hereafter. 
The earth is a combination of all the known forms of matter, 
acted upon by all the known forces of Nature. Each force 
producing some change in the position, form, or composition 
of some portion of matter. Every such change involves mo- 
tion, so that every particle of matter is constantly undergoing 
movement and change, although much of this motion and 
change is so gradual as to escape our most careful observation. 
Geology makes a survey of the present form and relations of 
the solid parts, or rocks of the earth; Stratigraphical geology, 
seeks to know what forces.are at work wow, and what have
-P-A-G-E-64
       been at work in the past, changing the form and relations o 
the rocks; Dynamical geology, collects and collates into a con- 
secutive record, the conditions of the earth under these changes 
as to climate, distribution of land and water, and of plants and 
animals over the face of the earth—Historical geology ; and also 
determines the composition and relation of the component parts 
of the matter of the earth—Chemical geology. 
We do not know what matter is. We only recognize its dif- 
ferent forms by certain features or properties. Take for ex- 
ample this glass of water. I ask you what it is, you answer, 
water. I ask you how do you know that it is water? You 
answer by describing its properties according to the extent and 
accuracy of your knowledge. You may give its color, form, 
weight, temperature, texture, and chemical composition. Prom- 
inent among its properties you would name its tendency to flow 
downward, seeking always a lower level. In illustration of its 
properties I pour a little on this slate, a little on this sponge, 
and another drop or two on this piece of quick-lime. The few 
drops on the sponge disappear from sight, and the sponge is 
found to be slightly moistened and a trifle heavier; you say the 
water has been absorbed that is taken up into the sponge, and 
stored away. The few drops on quick-lime also disappear, but 
in doing so they set up quite a ferment. There is quite a com- 
motion among the particles of lime, and a small puff like smoke 
floats off. After the ferment is over the bulk of the lime is 
much increased, yet it is apparently quite as dry as it was be- 
fore the water was poured on it, and what was a solid is now a 
fine powder. The chemist tells us thatthe water has formed a 
‘chemical reaction, and has combined with the lime. We turn 
‘to examine the few drops on the slate, and we do not find them. 
They have disappeared and scarcely left a trace behind. This 
_ disapperance you call evaporation. The water has spread out _ 
intotheair. Each of these changes is due to natural processes ; — 
in the one case called absorption, in the others chemical affinity — 
and evaporation. Taken together they illustrate the extent 
and constancy of the changes that all forms of matter are un- 
dergoing. : 
_ Our knowledge of things material is confined to the earth, 
Matter embraces eversthing that we can know through our 
   
-P-A-G-E-65
  (65). 
  senses, whether we know it as a gas, a hquid, or a solid, 
_ whether alive or not. 
You know that although the several drops of water have dis- 
appeared from sight, that they have not been destroyed. You 
know also that in each case the water in disappearing has done 
certain work—that it has wrought a change in some form of 
matter. Now what is true of these drops of water, is alike 
true of all the water on the face of the earth. And this is true 
of every other form of matter, 
Science’ teaches, (1) that, although the form, location, and 
composition of every particle of matter in the universe is con- 
stantly changing, its total sum has not changed by so much as. 
an atom since creation’s dawn. Not one atom has been gained, 
riot one atom lost: matter is indestructible. (2) That every par- 
ticle of matter is unceasingly subject to one or more forces, 
whereby it is constantly undergoing some sort of change, and 
“that each change is a record and a measure of the force at 
work. Yet the total sum of these forces is the same now as it 
was in the beginning. (8) That all forces are correlated, so 
that they are constantly changing from one form to another 
without the least diminution or increase of the total amount of 
energy. (4) That since the first living being was created, the 
current of life has flowed on in unbroken currents until now. 
All creation was primary, there is no such thing as spontaneous 
generation. 
These four doctrines are fundamental. They lie at the 
foundation not only of Geology, but of all modern cio 
Hence it is necessary that we state them clearly in the out! 
You will find them discussed in many books, pamphlets, and 
papers, under the several heads of The Correlation of Forces, 
The Conservation of Energy, and Evolution. 
There are many sciences, but only one scientific method, viz. : 
(1) Collect all the known facts; (2) compare and classify the 
facts collected; (8) deduce the laws that give rise to and govern 
the facts. 
This is not only the scientific method, but it is likewise the 
natural method. The earliest period of child life corresponds 
5 Ed
-P-A-G-E-66
    ( 66) 
to the first or accumulating period. A healthy boy is a perpetual 
- motion, self-loading, self-firing bundle of interrogation points. 
This is therefore the period for introducing into the school 
such sciences as are especially fitted to cultivate observing and 
discriminating powers. These studies are confessedly, Botany, 
Geology, Zoology, and Physiology. These studies may be be- 
gun by the youngest pupil, and will tax the highest powers of 
the most gifted college graduate. Indeed, I think that Profes- 
sor Huxley, the foremost man of science in all England, if not, 
indeed, in all the world, has uttered no more profound truth 
than that there is no study in the curriculum of the University 
that has not its root in the primary school. No science can be 
learned in fourteen weeks, or in forty weeks. 
The art of education is older than the centuries, but the sci- 
ence of education is yet to be made, a thing of .the future. 
But when made, we know that it will be based upon Mental 
Physiology; that it will recognize the fact that the mind is a 
- growth, that its faculties develop in a regular order, and the 
studies of the school will be made to conform to this order. 
At present we know that the child observes, the youth com- 
pares, and the adult judges—observation, comparison, judg- 
ment. Here we have the scientific method of investigation. 
Again, all mental development is from the simple to the com- 
plex. So should be our studies, simple for the child, less sim- 
ple for the youth, and complex for the older. 
I should not think of repeating such manifest truths and 
fundamental principles to a body of teachers, but for the fact 
that I have so often been asked how and when the sciences can 
best be introduced into the school-room. 
As to Geology, two first rate beginnings are offered. _ Hither, 
you may select type specimens of the rocks of your locality, 
and having first made yourself thoroughly familiar with their 
color, weight, texture, mode of clearage, fossil contents, mode 
of occurance and composition. Teach your pupils how to do 
the same thing by having them do it; or you may take them 
out into the fields, or better, along the nearest creek or railroad 
cut, and teach them how to study actual rocks. After you — 
have begun you will combine the field-study and cabinet, or 
 
-P-A-G-E-67
   ( 67) 
- specimen-study. In the beginning, if your pupils are quite 
young, all the text-books that I know about will prove a hin- 
drance rather than a help. 
IL. 
ATMOSPHERIC AND AQUEOUS AGENCIES IN GEOLOGY. 
As the State law requires something of the Geology of Tenn- 
essee to be taught in the Public Schools, I shall, as far as is 
practicable, use Tennessee as the specimen to be illustrated and 
studied. I have therefore prepared this.enlarged map of the 
rock surface of the State, and this enlarged section of the strata 
as they occur from the North Carolina line to the Mississippi 
River. Both are copied from Professor Safford’s Geology of 
Tennessee. 
If we could stand on the top of this mountain, locally known 
as Thunderhead, some morning in May, and look out toward 
the west as the sun is rising, we might fancy, indeed it is difi- 
cult to resist the impression, that we are standing on the shore 
of a vast sea—neither tree nor rock is to be seen. As we look 
in delighted wonder, the scene changes, and islands appear to 
dot the sea, and on them the glitter of spires and sharp peaks _ 
of towers, and gables of tall houses, bring the conviction that 
we are looking down upon towns and cities. The sun mounts 
higher and the sea is broken into rolling clouds of mist, the 
islands run together into long ridges of clustering peaks, the 
glittering spires melt away and winding valleys appear, from 
which here and there white columns of smoke curl up, mark- 
ing the lonely cabins at the heads of caves beneath. Were it 
earlier in the year, say February or March, the top of Thunder- 
head would be most likely covered with snow, for it is nearly 
six thousand feet above the level of the sea, and winter lingers 
here many days after it has left the valleys below. 
Should we seek a pathway down the nearest route, though 
not the easiest, would be down one of the branches. By this 
route, while we should miss most of the grand views presented 
by the unrivalled scenery, we should get a far better notion of 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
        ( 68 ) 
the geological structure of the mountains. The first spring 
that we tind gives out, from beneath a sandstone cliff, water as 
clear as crystal, and not more than 15° above freezing. It is 
the purest of freestone. The little stream that flows from it, runs 
but a short distance before it plunges over a ledge of sandstone, 
falling from ten to thirty feet, as the case may be. From un- 
derneath this ledge other streams flow, and the branch receives 
tributaries from both sides at short intervals. Hach little 
_ stream runs at a furious rate. Hach is checked and turned 
aside by large rocks that accidently have fallen across its path. 
Each runs over a bed of rock or large-sized gravel. Scarcely 
any sand is to be seen. As we get lower down, the streams 
flow more slowly, the bowlders in the beds are not so large, and 
the banks not so steep. All the way down, however, we should 
note that the rocks that line the banks do not lie horizontal, as 
around here, but are tilted on edge, at an angle of from 45° to 
90°. Looking somewhat like this row of books pushed over 
thus. 
Should we follow this stream on its way into the Tennessee 
River, and then keep on with the river, we should find the same 
condition and character of rocks along the bluffs that make the 
banks—until we pass into the narrows below Chattanooga. At 
this point the rocks become almost horizontal. The bed of the 
river is no longer solid rock as in the little mountain stream, 
but is a mixture of mud, sand, and gravel—the gravel varying 
_insize. The average grows smaller and smaller the further we 
_ follow the course of the river, until at Paducah it has become 
quite small, and the sand-banks quite abundant. 
After making a survey across the State, over the surface, and 
along the river banks, our note books ought to show us certain 
facts, observable in the rocks : 
(1) Stratification; (2) Upheaval; (3) Contortion; (4) Frae- 
ture; (5) Dislocation; (6) Erosion; (7) Unconformity; (8) Di- 
versity in character of rock; (9) Diversity in fossils. 
Each of these facts will furnish material for study into which 
time will not permit us to go. All the rocks of Tennessee may: 
be classed as stratified, as are the rocks of nine-tenths of the 
earth’s surface. ‘These stratified rocks always present one or ’
-P-A-G-E-69
     (69 ) 
  - more of three types, viz.: (1) Arenaceous, or sand stones; (2) 
Argillaceous, or clay stones; (8) Calcareous, or limestones. 
Each of these are to be found in different forms when solid and 
when loose—e. g., sandstones, when loose, as sand, gravel, shin- 
gle, rubble’; when hard, as sandstone, gritstone, breccia, con- 
glomerate; clay rock, when loose, as mud or clay; when hard, 
as shale, or slate; lime rock, as chalk, limestone, or marble. 
These types all graduate into one another. 
Each has been more or less consolidated as sediment either 
by some cementing force, such as carbonate of lime, silica or 
oxide of iron, or by long continued pressure, long continued 
high heat in the presence of water, or a combination of these 
forces. It is manifest that the materials of these rocks were 
deposited gradually by the fineness of lamination in the shale, 
by the delicate fossils so exquisitely preserved in both the shale — 
and limestone, by the nature of the limestone itself and of in- 
fusional earth. It is furthermore manifest that all of the strata 
must have been originally nearly horizontal, and subsequently 
uplifted and displaced from below. 
Again, it is shown by the fossil records of plants and animals 
in the various formations that there was a distribution of forma 
and floro while these rocks were forming quite similar to that 
prevailing now. 
‘The agencies that have wrought these changes are still at 
work. They may be grouped into Atmospheric, Agnesus, 
Igneous, and Organic. The work of the Atmospheric agen- 
cies are. 
Sechemical Disintegration of Tocks. 
Formation of soils. 
Frosts. 
2. Mechanical< Heat of sun. 
Winds. 
The Atmospheric agencies are silent and obscure, yet illim- 
itable and unceasing, therefore their work is unseen until it is © 
done, and immeasurable when done. Yet it is easy to mark 
some of the ways by which these agencies work.

    RECA: i 
  (70) 
All rocks are composed of materials approximately insoluble 
united by cements more or less soluble in water charged with 
carbonic acid or with other organic acids. The heat of the sun 
or the cold of frost expand and break up the rocks, admitting 
the air and moisture and disintegrating the hardest granite into 
soil. The sun dries out the soil into dust, which the winds 
blow about and the waters wash away. The air penetrates into 
every crack and cranny, and wherever it goes it begins the 
work of disintegration. 
But the air is never entirely free from water, the great leveler 
of nature. Water acts upon the surface of the earth—

The clouds of mist that we beheld from the top of Thunder- 
head are but examples on a large seale of the same process that 
we witnessed in the few drops of water poured on the slate. 
_ Byaporation lifts the clouds from the rivers and lakes, the ocean 
and the ecarth’s surface. It is at work without ceasing every- 
where. From the equator to the poles, on land and sea, un- 
broken streams of vapor are rising upward. But evaporation 
is the result of heat expanding the particles of water until they 
- become thin as air and lighter. Each drop of water converted 
into vapor carries with it a volume of heat, and each volume of 
vapor that is converted into a drop of rain gives up in the 
process of conversion all the heat that was necessary to keep it 
in vapor form. As the same drop falling from the clouds 
reaches the lower stratus of air, it absorbs more or less of gases, 
according to the locality. Striking the earth it follows one of 
three courses, either it is soon evaporated and repeats its course, 
- orrunning on the surface it gathers by floating or by solution

    light materials that it transports to a lower level, or it sinks 
to the earth and disappears. Could we follow it we should 
see it working its way by many a twist and turn until finally it _ 
appeared again in some one of the many springs that break out 
_ from the mountain side. As it came through the air it took up 
_ whatever gases might be floating, especially carbonic acid gas; 
armed with this gas, it has the power of breaking up almost.

rapidly as to rub and grind them round and smooth. The 
character of the bed of a stream depends, therefore, upon the 
rapidity of its current. The gravel beds of a river furnish 
specimens of the rocks that line the banks of its. tributaries 
above. The leveling power of rain is almost beyond compu- 
tation. It wears down the mountains and spreads out the 
plains over the whole earth.   
ITE 
IGNEOUS AGENCIES. 
With Atmospheric and Aqueous agencies, in all their varied 
forms, we are familiar from childhood, and therfore are apt to - 
overlook the extent of their work, but with the Igneous agencies

on trust vur knowledge of them. : 
localities, and though the cireuit of their work embraces the ; 
whole circumference of the earth, their track is comparatively 
    They are confined to certain — 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
    limited. Volcanoes and earthquakes undoubtedly are in some+ 
wise connected, but precisely how related we do not know. 
- Indeed, there is still much dispute going on among geologists 
‘as to the condition of the central part of the earth. All agree 
that it is inconceivably hot, but whether it is in a liquid ora 
solid state is uncertain. The liquid and the solid advocates 
offer somewhat different hypotheses to explain the phenomena 
of earthquakes and volcanoes. But neither party, as yet, can 
offer anything beyond hypothesis, so we will not stop to go 
through with their several arguments. All parties, however, 
agree that the earth was at one time in a state of complete in- 
candescence, and that it has come to its present condition 
through continued cooling and secular contraction. In this 
cooling the outer surface has been the first to lose its heat and 
contract into a solid and rigid state. Gradually during geolo- 
gical ages, this outer crust has thickened and contracted, and 
is still cooling and contracting. In the course of this contrac- 
tion, of necessity some parts of the outer crust are fractured 
and thrust the one side up and the other side down. These lines 
of fracture once established have continued to offer the least re- 
sistance to the upward and downward thrust and pressure. 
Thus the lines of upheaval, or mountain ranges, have been ris- 
ing, and the plains of depression, or sea bottoms, have been 
sinking. The mountains becoming higher and the seas deeper 
with time. Thus the outlines of the continents and of the 
_ ocean beds were marked out when first the waters were divided 
_ from the land. Since then the great continental features have 
- been added. All of the great land masses are approximately of 
a pyramidal form, with the appices pointing southward, and 
all are rimmed with mountain chains, the largest mountains 
facing the largest oceans; and the centers, basin-shaped, 
drained by river-systems. It is manifest that if there were no 
atmospheric or aqueous agencies at work, the continued up- 
lifting of the land masses, and the sinking of the ocean beds, 
-would have produced a very different state of things on the 
earth’s surface. But these agencies working together have con- 
tinually borne away the uplifted materials and spread it out 
‘into plains and valleys, or carried the surplus back to the ocean. 
Thus the balance is preserved. x

ORGANIC AGENCIES, 
  “So far we have dealt exclusively with the physical forces of. 
nature operating upon the materials of the earth, shaping and 
molding them into form and beauty; but we have said nothing 
of life or of living things; yet on the earth as we find it to-day, 
as it has been for ages and eras past, life may be accounted 
the great master force of nature. That force which in turn 
makes use of all other forces—to which all other forces are sub- 
servient. Here again it becomes us frankly to confess our 
ignorance. What life is, or whence or when it begap on 
earth, we do not know. In the very nature of things we 
cannot know. Geology does not attempt to solve these ques- 
tions. Geology never goes behind the record. And so far as 
the record goes, geology knows no time when life did not exist 
‘on the earth. What form, whether vegetable or animal—as we 
now know them—is only a matter of conjecture; but the oldest 
known rocks contain abundant proofs of the existence of life when 
they were forming. Iron, limestone, and graphite are, so far as 
“we know, never formed without the aid of organic products. 
Hence, wherever these materials are found, we know that life 
has prevailed. 
As we follow the record of the rocks, however, the fossil 
types begin to’ trace the current of life. ‘Here, too, as in the 
history of the rain-drop, we find that however the current may _ 
wind and twist, and pass for a time out of view, it is never 
broken, never lost, never ceases to perform some work; never 
_ fails to leave a record of its work. It is quite true, that as yet 
the whole story of life on the earth has not been collected. 
Many chapters and parts of chapters are missing, and it will 
require the constant labor of generations yet to come to com-, 
_ plete the work; but there are thousands of willing workers in 
the field, and as time removes each generation, others will fol- 
low in the footsteps, and hereafter the work will be done. 
Here we have small bits of iron ore, of coal, and of coral 
- limestone. Each bit is a perfect sample of its kind; each car- 
rying on its face and in its body a record of typical life work. *

    Each was taken from a survey across Tennessee. The existing 
peat-bogs, swamps, and river-estuaries, scattered over the earth, 
furnish us with examples of how coal is made. First, we have 
the vital force gathering from the air and the soil the building 
material for mosses, ferns, and trees. The chief of these is 
carbon. Now carbon is found so constantly in association with 
vital products, either vegetable or animal, that chemists have 
come to speak of organic chemistry as a branch of the carbon- 
compounds. This carbon collected by the plants is pressed and 
preserved under water, to prevent the air from destroying it, 
and passes under pressure and in time through various stages, 
such as peat, liquids, brown coal, bituminous, anthracite, and 
finally, graphite, which is almost pure carbon. 
This bit of iron was once dissolved, perhaps, in the sea, and 
deposited in the sea-bed, which afterward came to be dry land 
by upheaval. Some of the rain-drops, of which we spoke 
some days ago, falling upon banks of decaying leaves and plants, 
,. or passing through a portion of the air heavily charged with 
carbonic acid, absorbed this great re-agent, and sinking down 
into the earth, gathered each its load of iron, which is trans- 
ported down to some lower level, where, under changed chemi- « 
eal conditions, it dropped it into the bed, from whence it was _ 
mined as iron ore. 
This bit of coral, too, is composed of tissue which once 
formed a’ part of some mountain limestone. Perhaps from the 
mountain, by the rain-drops, it was borne into the sea, and 
there deposited to be taken up by the coral-polyp and built 
into this beautiful structure. These polyps have contributed 
largely to building the immense beds of limestone that under- 
lie this region.

Hunter NicHo1son. 
Jonusporo, Tenn., November 9th, 1886. : 
Capt. W. R. Garrett, Principal of Institutes, Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dear Srr—In response to your request of October 29th, in- 
closed find a synopsis of my work on School Government. 
The school should prepare the pupil for life. A teacher feel- 
ing that he has less than this to do, or that mental culture alone 
is required to be given from his hands, is utterly unfit for the 
_ responsibilities of the school-room. After having been placed 
in charge of the school, he should enter upon the duties before 
him with fear and trembling. Man is made in the image of 
God, and it is not too much to say that the teacher enters into 
the Holy of Holies when he undertakes to fashion the charac- 
ter of youth. It should be so molded and trained that it may 
always feel the impress of the Divine likeness, and never be © 
able to forget from whom the spiritual received its seal. Teach- 
ers, do'you realize that this is your work? Then the first step 
“is accomplished. Convinced of the sublimity, the magnitude 
will not appall those who are true teachers; in the valley of 
humility lessons of wisdom can be learned by those earnestly 
seeking for help, Seeing that the work does not end with the 
school-room, but reaches from earth to heaven, or, must I say 
it? from earth to darkness and death, my fellow-teacher, let us 
seek wisdom and counsel, gird ourselves for the strife, bestir 
ourselves like men, for it is a matter in which life or death is 
the ultimatum of our labors. From the primary department to 
the college hall let the words ring out like a bugle call thet the _ 
_ teacher is molding character to stand or fall in the contest of life. 
Molding character is the work to be accomplished, and the uses ‘always the same general processes, and that while there are
-P-A-G-E-76
      -only means furnished the teacher are the various branches of 
study adopted by the State and the apparatus of the school- 
room, these only indicating mental culture, the moral and phys- 
ical remain to be developed by the strength or weakness of the 
‘teacher. Mental habits are formed from mental actions; acts 
form habits, habits make character. If this be true of mental 
culture, the same will apply to the moral and physical. The 
‘question is as oldas Aristotle. Does character produce actions, 
or actions produce character? The trivial matters, little things, 
that the pupils do in the school-room are the land-marks by 
which we are to know and picture to ourselves the future man 
‘or woman. The boys and girls of the present are the men and 
women of the future, is a truth that must be ever present to our 
minds while couducting the work of the school-room. By 
skillful management, an earnest desire for the welfare of our 
pupils, we can so control their actions as to cultivate habits that 
will give them moral courage. ‘ 
A great deal of the unhappiness and much of the vice of the 
world is owing to weakness and indecision of purpose, in other 
words, to lack of courage. Men may know what is right, yet 
fail to exercise the courage to do it; they may understand the 
duty they have to do, but will not summon up the requisite res- 
-olution to perform it. The weak and undisciplined man is at 
the mercy of every temptation; he cannot say “No,” but falls 
before it. And if his companionship be bad, he will be all the 
easier led away by example into wrong doing. We must deal 
with the pupils from the same standpoint; if men are weak the 
children are the same, and their actions, if closely observed, 
will indicate to us where strength is needed. Nothing is 
more certain than that the character can only be sustained and 
strengthened by its own energetic action. The will, which is 
the central force of character, must be trained to habits of de- 
-cision, otherwise it will neither be able to resist evil nor to fol-_ 
low good. Decision gives the power of standing firmly, when 
to yield, however slightly, might be only the first step in a 
source of ruin. ° 
Calling on others for help in forming a decision is worse than 
useless. A man must so train his habits as to rely upon his~ 
 
-P-A-G-E-77
   Ci) 
emergency. Intellectual intrepidity is one of the vital condi- 
tions of independence and self-reliance of character. A man 
must have the courage to be himself, and not the shadow or 
the echo of another. He must exercise his own powers, think 
his own thoughts, and speak his own sentiments. He must. 
elaborate his own opinions and form his own convictions. It 
has been said that he who dare not form an opinion must be a 
coward; he who will not must be an idler; he who cannot must: 
bea fool. It is the strong and courageous who lead and guide: 
and rule the world. The weak and timid leave no trace behind 
them, while the life of a single upright and energetic man is. 
like a track of light. This, then, is the man we want to send 
out from the school-room, this is the result of good discipline, 
a well-ordered school. The government of the school does 
more toward forming this character than all the branches of 
study. 
Perfect discipline in a class or school is an indispensable con- 
dition of successful teaching. By perfect discipline we mean 
such as gives every one an opportunity to perform his duties. 
beneficial to himself and to his associates, never forgetting that 
individual interests must not conflict with the rights of others. 
In fulfilling this law he is only praticing the right of citizen- 
ship, and thereby preparing for his future career. Can the 
pupil learn to recognize the interests of his classmates, and so 
conduct his own work as to aid in the discipline? If the 
teacher fails to teach him this he utterly fails in his duties, and 
sends out to the world a vagabond. Obedience is essential to sue- 
eessful work in the school, the duty of obeying must be learned. 
before the learning of anything else becomes possible. The 
pupil learns obedience by performing acts of obeying in the 
workings of the school. 
System essential to obedience. The school well systematized 
gives time and opportunity for every duty without conflicting 
with the rights of any member, and the scholars readily see and 
appreciate the efforts which bring about order. Our present. 
system of education is one-sided, being chiefly intellectual, there- 
fore the moral and industrial part must be entirely controlled . 
own powers, and depend upon his own courage in moments of 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
  (78) 
by the discipline. In the effort to make the schools unsectarian, 
the moral training of the youth has been completely abandoned. 
The regularity and promptitude with which the work is con- 
ducted in the school-room will do much more to form decision 
of character in the student than any mere mental training he 
could possibly receive. A programme prepared with so many 
minutes for recitation, a specified time for recess, etc., should 
be strictly adhered to, a teacher becoming absorbed in a recita- ~ 
tion so as to prolong five or ten minutes past the allotted time, 
is simply losing control of himself and purloining time. He 
is trespassing upon the rights of others, the one thing that 
causes all the disorder. The teacher is the servant of the pupils, 
and they are justified in demanding his instruction for that 
twenty or thirty minutes as the case may be. The recitation 
should cease at the very second, and no excuses given or ex- 
pected; there can be none. The destiny of some pupil may be 
in the balance, and the weakness or indecision of the teacher 
produces a similar quality in the child. ; 
Let all the movements be controlled by signals from the 
teacher’s desk. This is one of the best helps in bringing about 
habits of prompt obedience; it leaves something for the pupil 
to do, something in a measure of which he is guardian; a re- 
sponsibility is resting upon him, and he is alive to see that his_ 
part is well performed. Observation teaches him that other 
bodies, companies, and communities work according to specified 
rules, interpreted by signals, and why not the school-room, 
. where so many boys and girls are collected? The members of 
the school feel that they take rank with the business in which 
their fathers are employed, and so feel their importance. The 
rules that govern men will apply to the youth, or vice versa, not 
that the standard of respect given to man should be lowered, 
-_ but that of the children should be raised. It requires, then, a 
watchfulness on the part of the teacher to see that these signals 
are given at the proper time. What business has a sluggard in ~ 
_ the school-room? None; we need men and women in the 
school-room that are recognized by everybody to be the handi- 
work of God, those who are mentally, morally,.and physically 
. elean; strong men, strcng women, with the strength of tender- 
ness, having vitality enough to meet aud appreciate the strength

and beauty of youth looking to them for instruction. System 
is the school completely planned and thoroughly organized ; 
energy is the power that inspires its movements, infuses life and 
vigor into all the departments; ’tis this will make the recitation 
interesting, bring to it fruits gathered in other fields than the 
one in which the class is laboring, shows to the students they 
have a classmate as well as instructor, that he is not looking 
down upon them from his superior point of observation, to 
them impossible heights, not a trace is left of the plan to de- 
velop such an egotistical monstrosity, and the scholars with a _ 
sigh thank God by intuition. 
Why necessary to be so exact in the workings of the school? 
The child learns by simple imitation without effort, almost 
through the pores of the skin. “A fig-tree looking on a fig- 
tree becometh fruitful,’ says the Arabian proverb. Impulses 
which last longest and are rooted the deepest have their origin 
near our birth. The first impression continues forever with 
the child. The first joy, first sorrow, first success, first failure, 
first achievement, first misadventure paint the foreground of 
his life. 
_ Vigilance an essential. “Eternal vigilance is the price of vie! 
tory.’ However systematic the organization, and however in- 
tense the energy of the teacher, no school can be successfully 
managed without untiring vigilance. To prevent disorder, not 
to detect, should the teacher use this watchfulness. A word, a 
look, or signal of some kind, may prevent. trouble both to 
teacher and pupil. For that reason the teacher must know his 
school, must know the feelings and purposes of the pupils. He 
governs best who anticipates and prevents offenses. The eye 
of the wide-awake teacher incites to diligence and dissuades 
from wrong. Watchfulness over self, guarding against any 
undue partiality toward a pupil that would become conspicuous 
to other members of the class, since any action of this kind on 
the part of the teacher is readily misconstrued by the scholars. 
‘Yet the teacher must act regardless of the charge of being par- 
tial to the pupils, must have decision of character to do what is 
right. 4 ; 
Will power must be combined with the other elements in gov-
-P-A-G-E-80
  ro STreany 
  erning. It may be termed decision of character, persistency of 
purpose. System must be strictly enforced, the will of the 
teacher requires prompt obedience, without question. Never 
dispute with a pupil, submission first on his part, explanation 
afterward if beneficial to the interests of the school. The de- 
termined teacher will hold the reins firmly, and will train to 
orderly Labits and efficient work. 
Self-control ranks higher than any other element in the teach- 
er’s qualifications. Before we can manage and control others, 
we must first be able to manage and control ourselves. ‘“ He 
that controlleth his own spirit is greater than he that taketh a 
city.” This does not simply mean control of temper, but of all 
powers used in the school-room. A display of anger is cer- 
tainly to be condemned, but not more so than to be boisterous 
or an excess of timidity; any of these indicate weakness. Per- 
fect self-control prepares for any emergency, enables the teacher 
to take advantage of circumstances, rendering them subversive 
to his own interests. Self-possession in the presence of the en- 
emy on the field of battle is not more to be desired than the 
same quality in the school-room. It is enough to direct the 
#whole machinery; it produces a like result in the student, and 
if we can give to the country citizens able to exercise this qual- 
ity in their character, we send out those who are thoroughly 
educated. They can concentrate their energies and make a 
success of life. 
Confidence in your pupils. Trust your pupils, and they will 
seldom betray the trust. Believe them, accept their statements 
as given, rely upon their honor, and they will never fail you. 
We have no bad childrenif the proper method is pursued in 
developing their best qualities. Teach them honor—the value 
of it, if they do not know it; and unless the home influences 
are such as to counteract your instructions, you will find a quick 
response to your appeals for the truth. This will enable them 
to cultivate the moral courage, giving them the power to say, 
“ No,” when temptation to do wrong is offered. Confidence in 
- them to believe they are not afraid to acknowledge a fault if 
committed, reporting their own misconduct with a trust in the 
teacher, relying alone upon his judgment as to punishment.
-P-A-G-E-81
        (81) 
Pupils should report their own deportment; if it is bad, to — 
expect the punishment; if good, the contentment of an ap- 
proving conscience. The moral courage to report is found in 
every pupil, and under the hands of a skillful teacher, one 
having a knowledge of human nature, child nature can be de- 
veloped into a strength of character that will last through life. 
Show the pupils the superiority of this trait over that of mere 
physical bravery, hold up to them men and women of the past 
that have been especially endowed with this attribute, and they 
will be quick to follow in the footsteps; they learn by imita- 
tion, Children will give you truth for truth; but it requires 
perfect reliance on the part of the teacher. Manifest an inter- 
est in their welfare ; what interests the pupil should interest the 
instructor. Find out and know their weaknesses; sympathize 
with them, help to guard against that which will lead them 
into wrong. Self-reporting is the only method that should be 
used to correct disorder. It has been condemned by those high 
in authority—not educational authority, however, but by those 
sitting in judgment upon national affairs. But that should not 
influence the teacher; he is the one above all others to \deter- 
mine the needs of the youth, and must, regardless of all oppo- 
sition, think and act for himself. Some of our best writers ors 
school management condemn it, yet they are not infallible. 
Some teachers, that have been in the work for/yéars, state that 
it encourages untruthfulness in the child, and that is equivalent 
to saying they are all cowards. Who will resent that charge 
quicker than a student? There is more truth to be found. 
among the children in the school than in the same number of 
individuals selected indiscriminately from the masses! ) Then 
strengthen it by leaning upon it, depending upon it, and you 
be the gainer in every respect. 
Do you want proof for the method? Go to the teachings of 
the Son of God, who, although omniscient, yet always gave an 
opportunity for self-justification or condemnation: “By thy 
words thou shalt be justified; by thy words thou shalt be con- 
demned.” The law of our land compels no one to criminate 
himself, but we are not dealing with criminals—ours is to pre- 
vent the commission of crime. We must refer to a higher 
standard, must reach the heart, and there find a responsive — 
6 Ed ; . 
 
-P-A-G-E-82

    (82) 
echo to the touch of truth. Then train them for this work by — 
short talks once or twice a week, perhaps oftener, on the sub- 
ject of moral courage and its opposite, give them sketches of 
noble men and women who have been possessed of this char- 
acteristic, hold it up to them as the ideal of what is good and 
beautiful, and they will respond every time. Use judgment, 
remember with whom you are dealing, and your work, it is an — 
justrument that must not be abused. The vigilant teacher will 
know what to do, and to him this is directed. Let not self- 
reporting become a mere mechanical effort on the part of the 
pupil, as it is sometimes conducted. Calling the roll every day 
and requiring pupils to answer and report misconduct, if any, 
is a dangerous precedent, and should be used sparingly. Time, 
place, and circumstance must determine the action of the 
teacher. 
Give the teacher all the qualifications mentioned, and yet, 
without heart power, his work will be weighed in the balance 
and found wanting. ‘‘Give your child to be educated by a 
slave,’\ said gn ancient Greek, “and instead of one slave you 
‘will have two.” 
> Love for the work, enthusiasm to infuse the whole work with 
~ interest, that you may be felt as an effective force, is necessary. 
_. The best, engines that have been constructed utilize only 20 
per cent. of heat power generated. For heat power let us say 
heart power among. the teachers, and it may solve the cause of 
sé.many failures, so. many absentees from the ranks, choosin, 
other professions, because they failed at teaching. Fail in the 
teaching profession because they bring no heart power into the 
work. Every one that leaves and seeks his fortune in some 
other avenue of life may be written as having failed. Some 
things that are not heart power: A teacher taking charge of a 
school for the first time in a strange community is advised by 
writers of Theory and Practice, School Government, by emi- 
nent men in the profession, to find out who are the bad pupils, 
that he may be prepared to catch them at any murderous attempt 
on his life. In other words, he is instructed to act the spy, as 
if in an enemy’s country, or act a cowardly part that would be 
- eensured if detected in a pupil. Make no inquiries of the ;
-P-A-G-E-83
          (88) 
atrons who are the bad pupils; act the part of aman, be open 
in all actions. Patrons know nothing special about the scholars 
_ of a school, except as their good or bad qualities have been 
developed by the teacher. Pupils that were considered unruly 
by your predecessor may be your very best scholars, and form 
a nucleus round which you can concentrate the strongest ele- 
ments in the school. The deportment of every pupil is perfect, 
so far as your knowledge of the circumstances and situation is 
concerned, and must be accepted as such until disproved by 
misconduct in your presence. Some men do business upon the 
principle that all are scoundrels; others give credit for honesty 
in every person unless the opposite trait displays itself. Teachers 
must take the latter course if they wish to inculcate the same 
_ feeling in the-breast of the pupil. 
  A teacher, in order to succeed, must not only be an enthu- 
siast, but he must be profoundly interested in the kind of ma- 
_ terial that comes to his hand to be molded and influenced, and 
in the processes through which he acts upon it. Every live 
teacher has his own way of work, and accounts it a misfortune 
to find himself lapsing into the mere mechanism of his pro- 
 fession. 
Not win their love so much as to do your duty by them, with- 
out regard to the opinion they may have of yourself—although 
you wish it to be favorable; an utter recklessness of the feel- 
ings they may entertain for you, is far better than anything else. 
  Heart power was the great secret of success in such men as 
Pestalozzi, Froebel, and others. Pestalozzi’s success was through 
the force of his all-conquering love, the nobility of his heart, 
the resistless energy of his enthusiasm, he stands forth among 
educational reformers as the man whose influence on education 
_ is wider, deeper, more penetrating than that of all the rest— — 
_ the prophet and the sovereign of the domain in which he lived 
and labored. ; 
The first lesson, then, that we learn from this truly great 
man is, that the teacher must have a heart—an apparently sim- 
ple, but really profound discovery, to which we cannot attach 
_ too much importance. Pestalozzi reached his pupils through - 
   
-P-A-G-E-84
(84) 
  the proper channel, and lessons pregnant with wisdom may be ~ 
learned if we but follow in his foot-steps. Love, love for the. 
scholars, not the kind that would permit them to follow their 
own inclinations, nor such as desires to have the object of affec- 
tion for selfish gratification, but consideration for their well- 
being—guard them from danger, anticipate the pitfalls that le 
in their pathway through life. He who thinks that he knows 
enough about what he teaches, ceases from that moment to be 
in any sense a teacher at all. Some have said the work is mo- 
notonous; nothing is more monotonous than ignorance. It is 
the feeling that enough knowledge has been gained, the circle 
is completed and there is no more good to be accomplished, 
makes teaching monotonous. 
The future of the nation always rests in the hands of that 
small proportion of the people who are in earnest ; so of edu- 
ation. Good teaching is not an easy thing. Those who under- 
take to call out the intelligence, and fashion the character of 
children, are undertaking to deal with the most complex and 
wonderful phenomena in the world. We are artists chiselling- 
the statue from the marble, which when completed, will have 
on it the grace or the defect which we put there. Every new 
educator effects less than his predecessor, the greatest work is 
performed in the Primary Department of our schools. 
The best instructor is one who renders his pupils indepen- 
dent of himself; the best disciplinarian, one who trains his 
pupils to govern themselves. After enumerating the mental 
qualifications necessary for a teacher, before entering upon the 
duties of the school-room; let there be added one hundred per 
cent. of Physical Health and the same of Heart Power. :

Hon. Thomas H. Paine: 
Dear Str—Inclosed please find report of Normal Institutes ‘held in West Tennessee during the summer of 1886, viz.: 
Collierville, June 21-26. 
Bolivar, June 28, July 3. 
Dresden, July 5-10. 
The schedule of work done was substantially the same at 
each Institute, viz.: 
Frank M. Smith, Principal and Instructor in Primary Meth- 
ods, School Management, and Grading of Country Schools. , 
  Prof. John L. Lampson, State Normal College, Geography 
and United States History. 
Prof. A. P. Bourland, Southwestern Baptist University, 
Jackson, teacher of English. 
At Collierville I had the assistance of Mrs. W. H. Horton, 
County Superintendent of Schools, Shelby County, Miss Flor- 
ence Acree, of Clara Conway Institute, Memphis, Professor 
Reinhart, Bartlett, Tenn., and many other teachers of ability. 
F Lectures were delivered by Hon. John L. T. Sneed and James 
M. Greer, Memphis. 
Nearly two hundred teachers were in daily attendance, five 
counties being represented, besides several teachers from Mis- 
sissippi. 
Much of the success of this Institute is due Mrs. Horton, 
who was the local manager. 
At Bolivar the local management was good also, being in the 
hands of Prof. T. 8. Minter, County Superintendent, Hardeman 
County. 
  Mrs. Horton and quite a number of the teachers of Shelby 
_ County attended this Institute. 
Interesting lectures were delivered by Francis Fentress, Esq., 
_ Mrs. W. H. Horton, Professors McDaniel, Rose, and Superin- 
_ tendent Minter.

The attendance at this Institute was good, especially at night, 
when popular lectures were delivered. The sessions were held 
in the court-house, and the room was crowded to its utmost 
capacity each nia 
County Superintendent Davis was the local manager of the 
Institute held at Dresden, Weakley County, and did his work 
well. The attendance was not so large as at either of the other 
Institutes, but the interest was equal in every respect to that of 
either of the others. 
Popular lectures were delivered by Hon. Emmerson Hth- 
ridge, and several teachers of the vicinity. 
I may add for the benefit of those who will read this report. 
that the lectures delivered by you at each of said Institutes did 
much to add to the interest of the same. The way in which 
you presented the cause of popular education, what had been 
done, what our prospect in the future, and what was demanded 
of us by the age in which we live, set those who heard you to 
thinking, and I am satisfied that good results will follow. 
At each of said Institutes strong resolutions urging the in- 
coming Legislature to make an appropriation for Institute pur- 
poses were unanimously adopted. 
I herewith submit a complete outline of the method of teach- 
ing English as presented by Professor Bourland. I trust you 
may be,able to publish it in full. The method of teaching En- 
glish as presented by Professor Bourland I consider the most

   THE TEACHING OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 
A Report Concerning THE Work on THis SuBJECT IN THE 
Srate Norman Institutes Hetp 1n West TENNESSEE. 
As the breaking out of the bud into a flower makes known 
and reveals the innermost of the flower, so he who speaks 
makes his inner nature known by his own action; so language 
makes its inner known by the outer, and is therefore the repre- 
sentation of the inner by the outer. Thus a teacher of teachers 
has spoken; uo one can fail to see the genuine beauty in this 
truth. Lauguage is a growth from the great soul of humanity 
which has been subjected to such an infinite variety of condi- 
tions that no one can trace the intricate courses of its develop- 
ment. Man’s environment co-operates with his physical organ- 
ism in inducing operations which seek for expression, and find 
it in various ways. We perceive, remember, conceive, judge, 
reasou, and speak. These are the outcomes of our human natures. 
This power of speaking is our triumphant superiority, and 
with its development we are now earnestly concerned. 
It is clearly evident that if we will develop speech-power we 
must work zealously for the development of mind power. To 
show what organs are concerned in the production of each in- 
dividual’s speech, we submit the following diagram: 
THE POWER OF SPEECH. 
I.— Organs of Sensation: 
1. Touch. 
2. Taste. 
3. Smell. 
4, Hearing. 
5. Sight. 
Il.— Organs of Perception, Memory, Conception, Judgment, and 
Reason: 
1. The cells of the gray cortical substance of the 
_ cerebrum. 
2. The nervous tubules of the white cerebral sub- 
stance. 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
  (88) 
IIl.— Organs of Expression : 
The larynx. 
The pharynx. 
The nasal cavity. 
The cavity of the mouth. 
5. The nerves of the air-passages. co bo et 
In view of these facts, I plead with the teachers to study 
their own minds and the processes of speech acquirement. I 
plead with them to study the minds of their children, and the 
nature of the language they are learning; to lay aside all gram- 
matical prejudices and look with open eyes upon the real 
nature of things. Men such as Max Muller, Whitney, Earle, 
and Morris, have written of our tongue; they are worthy of 
study. ‘Too much time cannot be given to the study of Sully, 
Volkmann, Preyer, Spencer, Luys, Froebel, and Bain, all of 
whom have written nobly on the Psychology of Language and 
Education. The study of the masterpieces in prose and poetry, 
written by our English and American men and women, is of 
prime import. We too must have means for the bringing 
about of our aims, devices for the realization of our methods, 
hence all are most urgently pressed to supplement their own 
practices with those of other teachers. Visit your neighbors; 
read the School Journals; keep the County Institute. vigorously 
alive! 
The entire language work of the school is based upon the 
same laws which have unconsciously guided the child in all of 
its previous speech-acquirement and development. Now the 
activities will be more systematic and co-ordinated for more 
definite ends. In all organic growths there is a central life 
which works for the realization of the purpose of its being. 
IN THE SCHOOL-ROOM. 
The Lessons.—Every ‘Reading Lesson” can be made a 
“Language Lesson” of the highest value; so with every 
“Arithmetic Lesson,” every “ Geography Lesson,” every “ Hist- 
ory Lesson;” active, intelligent teachers may tranform even 
- every “ Grammar Lesson” into a “Language Lesson” of some 
utility. 
 
-P-A-G-E-89
   (89) 
‘The following is a general outline for the lessons in the 
Readers: 
oo An object-lesson : the central object of the lesson in Reader. 
2. The Picture-lesson. 
8. The Reading. 
4. Some written work embracing the new words, and some 
grammatical peculiarity. 
Methods for the other lessons are easily devised. 
When an object is examined by the students, be sure their 
minds are impressed with the general form, with the essential 
characteristics, and with the striking features. When the pict- 
ure is studied, develop a lesson akin to that which the book 
presents; this will lead the mind into the thought more easily 
than if it went only through the words. When the reading 
comes, let the book talk; above all, in the interest of the soul, 
have the spelling done on slates or on paper. Banish forever 
the old spelling classes in rows, to which words are given out 
for oral spelling. The tongue, larynx, and vocal cords have to 
do pronunciation; the hand is concerned with spelling. Hach 
needs special exercise for its special function. 
Language Lessons.—The school law requires “ English Gram- 
mar” to be taught in all of the Public Schools of Tennessee. 
Many a long year “English Grammar” has been trying to 
teach “how to use the English language correctly.” Richard 
Grant White tells the experience of us all in “ Words and their 
Uses,” page 274: “How preposterous, how impossible, for us to 
measure our English corn in Latin bushels!” Still many up- 
right, honest men propose to measure our grammar to us in 
Latin bushels. Modern America sees too clearly to be duped 
much longer. 
  We want a system of training that will develop the power of a 
speech which belongs to the human race and constitutes their 
triumphant superiority over the animals lower than it in the 
scale of existence. This power of speech enables us to compre- 
hend thought expressed in words, and to express our own 
thoughts in words. Our students then are to be prepared for — ; 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
  (90)) 
assimilating the life that is in the masterpieces of our literature, 
as well as for fitly expressing that life which animates each 
BON Oa." 
Every course of training certainly involves: 
1. Materials. 
2. The arrangement and application of these materials for 
certain results. 
From the home, its yard and garden, be they ever so humble, 
the little fellows will gather materials for our work. In the 
fields, smiling with happy harvests; in the hedge rows, conceal- 
ing homes of flowers and birds; alongside the brooks that sing 
along with the rustling leaves; in the heart of the great, grand 
old forest itself, we can easily find what is needed for our work. 
If we cannot bring everything into the school-room with our 
hands, our eyes and ears will bring distinct images and ideas to 
be used in our lessons in language. 
Each teacher needs the aid of pictures to do his work well. 
These he can collect from innumerable quarters. (From my 
collection I made selections and exhibited them daily before 
our audiences, explaining fully how to prepare them. 
For the work is needed, too, collections of stories, descrip- 
tions, and extended narratives embodying descriptions of va- 
rious kinds. (I also exhibited some of my own collection of ver- 
bal pictures and explained the manner of their preparation. 
ARRANGEMENT AND APPLICATION. 
So as to give body to the work I arranged and presented the 
following course of study, which is intended to begin the first 
_ day of a child’s school-life, and to end—when time ends. 
First Year.—I. Talking lessons about familiar and interesting 
objects. 
  II. Stickney’s Child’s Book of Language, No.1. (Appleton.) 
III. Lessons with pictures and idioms, aided by Language

Stickney’s Child’s Book of Language No. 3.    II. Language Tablet No. 2. Objects and pictures. 
If. Child’s Book of Language No. 4. 
IV. Stories and pictures. 
Third Year.—I. A series of bird lessons, oral and written. 
1. Birds in general. 
. The largest and smallest birds. 
. Different kinds of birds. 
. Nests; kinds, where, when, how, and why built. 
. Food, where and how got.

dividual characters and differences; the concluding lessons will 
impress the common qualities and result in a classification un- 
der a common name. > or He co bo

It is not expected that the teacher will be able to place all 
of these works in the hands of his pupils, but that he will se- 
cure them himself as guides and suggesters for his work. All 
ean be had for a very small outlay. Rich will be the returns 
for the investment, if the teacher will work with them patient- 
ly and earnestly. 
Each teacher in Tennessee can soon collect thousands of beau- 
tiful pictures, stories, and descriptions, which, introduced into 
_. the body of the work in a fitting way, will give it a rare beauty, 
    _a wondrous power, and astonishing efficiency. They stir the 
inner life into activity; this will find an easy expression with 
one who is a student of the English language. Then the chil- 
dren are led into nature; followers of the birds, seekers for 
flowers, seers of the varied visions of the sky-land, they feel 
the stirrings of the mystic influences that flower forth into lofty 
thoughts, uplifting feelings and inspiring actions. When these 
_ find expression in language there is something enduring and
-P-A-G-E-93
  (98 ) 
  sustaining. “Language is the representation and expression of 
the human spirit, as nature is the representation and expression 
of the Spirit of God,” says Froebel. 
Tf a child comes to the meanings of his words through the 
exercise of his perceptual and conceptual powers, he can thor- 
oughly comprehend the meaning of a sentence as a whole, and 
this is the end to be striven for. Understanding the extent, 
comprehending the intent of our words, one can easily grasp 
the content of sentences, chapters, and volumes. The reason 
why so few realize the rare excellence of our Chaucer, our 
Milton, our Shakspere, lies in the fact that our words are what 
we make them. To a botanist who has carefully studied the 
flower, “ primrose” means something different from what it 
represents to some careless observer. Words are become count- | 
ers for notions. ‘All instruction involves the unfolding of the 
meaning of general terms,’ asserts James Sully. Kingdon Clif 
ford truthfully, boldly, says, “ The world in which we live is a 
world of general conceptions and these are determined by lan- 
guage and expressed by signs.” 
Besides the mastery of a rich word-hoard what need the men 
and women of our land? Surely to know that one word is a 
noun and that another is a verb, is worth no more than know- 
ing that one letter is A and that anotheris B. The thinker, 
whether he speaks or writes, wants to impress and convince 
mind. Above all things he must work for a unity and a move- 
ment, a power and a growth in his products. The means by 
which one can be led to secure these great qualities of compo- 
sition were discussed at length. 3 
We are asked, “Shall the pupil never be taught ‘ English 
Grammar?’” Yes, so much as the Norman Conquest and the 
progressive movements of eight centuries have left of it. How- 
ever, we want, our students to learn the peculiarities of our 
speech, few indeed they are when compared with those of 
other tongues, just as the German boy learns his “ Der, Die, ? 
Das.” Let there be an unconscious inworking of the character- — 
istie forms and changes into the organic development of the — 
power of speech. Then the thoughts will form into expressions 
just as naturally as seeds grow into individual forms. Habit — 
   
-P-A-G-E-94
  (94) 
  goes all the way in language. We incorporate some “ English 
Language” teaching in the work of each grade, and before we 
know it, we have correct speakers and writers of our students. 
A child can certainly learn about the forms and uses of nouns 
in the first and second grades; about the forms and uses of ad- 
jectives in the third grade; verbs in the fourth ; adverbs in the 
fifth; pronouns in the sixth, and phrases and clauses in the 
seventh. Yes, each one will learn to use all these correctly with 
all the marks used for punctuating. The entire energy is to be 
certered upon the thought; the mechanical in composition 
comes without conscious effort. 
Early in life the students begin the work of description and 
“narration. When the boy tells the teacher of what he saw on 
his way to school his work is akin to that which Hawthorne 
did in his “ Note Books” when he describes the experiences of 
an excursion, he is composing a miniature “Sketch Book ;” 
when he tells of the sky at sunset, he is transformed into a 
Ruskin which retains all individual characteristics. Let such 
men come to the nourishment of the growing boy and he will 
have all the elements suited for life development. His compo. 
sitions will possess high merit; he himself will learn to love the 
good and sustaining in literature. No need of sermons on vicious 
literature for him. “We are all poets when we read a poem 
well.” 
Teachers, our work is a heroic business. Here are eternal 
interests to be considered. Here are immortal energies to be 
prepared for action. No materials are nobler than our litera- 
ture and our language. Thought power and language power 
determine man’s power. Witha zest and a zeal we will address 
ourselves unto the holy work. Mind, language, and literature. 
There are few fairer fields. In the realms of culture none are 
fuller of promise. ‘Let us make our education brave and pre- 
_ventive.” 
We began with Froebel, it is fitting for us to end with Rich- 
ter. “To learn to speak is something higher than to learn to 
speak languages; and all the advantages which are ascribed to 
ancient languages, as educational media, apply with double
-P-A-G-E-95
      (95) 
force to the mother -tongue.” “The writing of one page ex- 
cites the desire of learning more strongly than the reading of a 
whole book.” “Every TeprencHa ar without some actual ob- 
* ject or motive, is poison.’ 
  The five days of our Institutes were utterly inadequate for 
the work assigned. These pages are insuflicient for the telling 
of what was really done. I have the satisfaction to know that 
many teachers have adopted the plans suggested, and are now 
more satisfied with their work. Other teachers not at the Insti- — 
tutes, hearing of the work, have written me for outlines of the | 
course. All of these I have cheerfully answered. Iam thorough- 
ly convinced that the study of our mother-tongue is on the way 
to ahigher efficiency. Throughout this section of the State there — 
is an anxious inquiry as to the ways and means of its teaching. 
Very respectfully, 
AuBert P, BouRLAND.

Teachers must have detinite plans and definite means. If mind 
is aroused to action, centered upon some object and led natur- 
ally to its comprehension, the vocabulary of that object, its 
name, the names of its parts, qualities, features, habits, or 
uses, is easily assimilated into the language domain the being 
controls. If the mind is trained under the influence of the 
masters of our speech, it can but gain from their power and 
their possessions. Richard Grant White is surely right in his 
idea that the constant submission of a teachable, apprehensive
-P-A-G-E-97
    (97)      mind, to the influence of minds of the highest class, in daily 
_ life and book, will bring out upon language its daintiest bloom 
and its richest fruitage. 
_ Then, study mind; study mental development; study speech 
development; study the English language, its psychology, its 
structure and its literature; study the devices suitable for lan- 
guage teaching, if you will be a teacher of the language learned 
first from the mother in the dear old home of childhood. 
  
In conclusion allow me to say that your work as State Sup- 
erintendent of Public Instruction has been successful, the cause 
of popular education has had in you an able advocate. Thank- 
_ ing you for your many acts of kindness to me, I am your 
friend, Frank M. Smita. 
SPECIAL REPORT OF W. R. GARRETT, 
Princrpan or Instirutes ror Mippiz anp East TENNESSEE. 
It affords me pleasure to invite attention to the following 
special report of Capt. W. R. Garrett, Principal of Institutes 
for Middle and East Tennessee. The subject he suggests is 
worthy of much consideration: 
NasHVILLE, Tunn., December 18th, 1886. 
Hon. Thomas H. Paine, State Superintendent of Public Instruction 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dear Sir—In addition to my report of State Institutes this 
day submitted, I append the following special report for the 
purpose of conveying a suggestion for your consideration. 
In the summer of 1885, Prof. N. T. Lupton was employed by 
you at the Teachers’ Institute held at Jackson, and delivered an 
excellent course of lectures on Practical Agriculture, which 
_ elicited much interest, and did much, in that locality, to create _ 
7 Ed 
   
-P-A-G-E-98
    
(98) 
a strong popular feeling in favor of the general introduction of 
agricultural study in our public schools. So clearly was the 
great value of this character of study shown, and so plainly 
demonstrated was the practicability of introducing it into the 
public school course, that the idea seemed to spring into the 
minds of all that a similar course of lectures ought to be deliv- 
ered in every county in the State. Soon after this institute, I 
suggested to you, in conversation, the propriety of making an 
arrangement with the Bureau of Agriculture to supply a suit- 
able lecturer on this subject, and to appoint at each State- 
Teachers’ Institute, one day to be set apart as a farmer’s picnic 
day, for the purpose of a conference between the teachers and 
the people to devise means for improving the agricultural inter- 
ests of the State, and of introducing systematic instruction on 
agriculture in the public schools. The matter received at the 
time your favorable consideration, and led to an interview 
with the Commissioner of Agriculture, in which it was concluded 
that warrant could not be found in the law to enable him to re- 
munerate a lecturer for this purpose. 
During the past summer, my convictions on this point were 
much strengthened by the admirable work done in the same 
line by Prof. J. W. Glenn of the University of Tennessee, at 
the institute at Sweetwater, and by Prof. J. L. Bachman at the 
institutes at Sweetwater and Morristown. 
The practicability of an agricultural course of study was 
demonstrated beyond contradiction. Much, however, would be 
needed to put it in operation. In the tirst place, our teachers 
must be instructed how to teach it, and where can the teachers 
be trained so well and so speedily as at the Teachers’ Institute? 
It is not necessary, in the beginning, to have at the institutes 
a thorough course of training. The hint, the valuable hint, can 
be supplied. The strong common sense, and the awakened in- 
vestigations of our teachers will enable them to put it into 
practice. In the beginning, such instruction in our schools 
would not be, by any means, complete, but it would be a begin- 
ning. Year by. year, the teachers would become more expert 
in such work, suitable text-books would be published, and pub- 
lic attention would be turned in this direction. It would not 
 
-P-A-G-E-99
         (99) 
e long before the public benefit would be felt and recognized 
in the improvement in our farming, and, better still, in the 
_ spirit engendered in our young men. 
The growing generation need something to foster in their 
_ minds a love of rural life. At present everything tends to al- 
lure them to the city. Even our education weans them from 
the farm. 
  I, therefore, respectfully suggest to you to consider the means 
of accomplishing this good result ; either by urging the enact- 
_ ment of a law to furnish the State Superintendent the means 
_ of employing a State Lecturer on Agriculture to attend the 
Teachers’ Institute, or by placing such an officer in the field 
under the auspices of the Commissioner of Agriculture, or 
- under the direction of the Tennessee State Agricultural Col- 
lege. Respectfully submitted, 
W. R. Garrett.

  CITY SCHOOLS. 
  CHATTANOOGA CITY SCHOOLS. 
Hon. Thomas H. Paine, State Superintendent Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dear Str—Inclosed please find report of the Chattanooga 
Public Schools for the year ending July 81st, 1886: 
Our schools embrace eight Grammar and Primary grades and 
Junior, Middle and Senior High School classes. 
A class of nineteen graduated from the High School, and 
there was also one graduate from the High School Department 
of the Colored Schools. 
The following extracts are taken from the city press of May 
22d, 1886 : 
“The school year of 1885-6 was closed yesterday. Interest- - 
ing exercises were held in the school buildings, and the teach- 
ers and pupils vied with each other in decorating their rooms. 
The year just closed has been one of the most satisfactory in 
the history of the Public Schools in Chattanooga.” “The 
Times this morning gives itself up chiefly to an account of the 
closing exercises of the Public Schools, and certainly our space 
could not be devoted to the chronicling of a nobler institution’s 
achievements. Those who will remember back to 1865, and 
for several years thereafter, when the town was practically des- 
titute of means of instruction, and then glance over the mag- 
nificent showing made yesterday, will have at once a gauge of 
educational progress and growth of the city.”

COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS REPORTS, 
ANDERSON COUNTY. 
- J. P. Morton, SupERInTENDENT, Clinton. 
I am happy to say that our Public Schools have been very 
progressive the past year. The teachers have taken much 
pains in their respective schools, and have manifested greater 
interest in the work than in any preceding year. 
Our Normal School this year was far superior to that of last 
year. It was well attended, and many modern plans of teach- 
ing were brought out, which were successfully carried into the 
different schools and made to work admirably. Our teachers 
have been benefited by the normal work carried on under your 
own supervision. Although all do not come in direct contact 
with your normal training, yet it has already assumed unprece- 
dented influence. Its mission is not finished. I hope we will 
have your Normal Institutes continued. I report our County 
— Institutes a success. We have held them regularly. They 
have been well attended both by teachers and patrons. I find 
the medium of Institutes one of the most successful ways of 
waking up public mind. The public mind in our county is fast 
developing in favor of a higher standard of education. For 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
    (116 ) 
many reasons, one of which is the patronizing of educated and 
qualified teachers, the schools are constantly developing system, 
and improving in efficiency. 
The building interest was never greater in our county. In 
the last two years several school-buildings have been completed, 
and some three or four are in course of erection. 
BEDFORD COUNTY. 
J. H. ALLen, Superinrenpent, Shelbyville. 
Gathering public school statistics, as County Superintendents 
are forced to gather them, is a tedious and vexing task, but here 
is my second annual report, I hope that a desire for correct- 
ness, in every important particular, is a sufficient excuse for its 
tardiness. 
The schools of this county are stillimproving. Most of them 
have been well managed, and the results are reasonably satis- 
factory. Excepting two or three, they have given little cause 
for serious complaint. My report shows an increase in enroll- 
ment and daily attendance. A proportional improvement is 
noticeable in almost every other particular. 
My visits for this year exceed one hundred and fifty. In the 
annual round of visitations I was forced to visit from two to 
three schools each day or allow some to close before they were 
visited. I have “delivered” several “public addresses,’ and 
have “talked” to most of the schools in the county. The 
_ children in every school gave me most respectful attention, and : 
seemed anxious to profit by any good advice given them. If 
you want an audience that knows how to make a speaker 
happy, put yourself in the presence of a Bedford County 
school. Believing that earnest, effective county supervision is’ 
extremely necessary to the success of the public school system, 
I have given all my energy, time, and talent to the work. I
-P-A-G-E-117
   
      (117) 
have enjoyed the hearty co-operation of directors and teachers. 
As a result of our labors, we have the pleasure of knowing 
that our schools are better than they have been in any previous 
. year. 
Generally speaking, directors have been wisely chosen in this 
county. They seem desirous of improving the schools of their 
respective districts, and they are putting their desires to prac- 
tical use. They have built and furnished four neat and com- 
fortable houses during the year, and improved others. They 
are becoming more cautious in selecting teachers, and are vis- 
iting schools better than heretofore. They study the school. 
law and try to meet its requirements. I doubt there being a 
county in the State that has better school directors than Bed- 
ford County has. 
Our teachers are on the right line and pressing forward. 
Most of them are “worthy and well qualified”’ What they 
like in qualification they are striving to gain at their own ex- 
pense. One hundred regular attendants at the Normal Insti- 
tutes, which continued from three to four weeks, and in which 
they used their own time and money, shows that they are wide- 
awake and determined. They are practical, interesting, perse- 
vering and energetic in their institute work, and there is no 
relaxation of energies when they go to their school-rooms. 
Many of them are reading educational journals and other 
works concerning the profession. Of course, some are not 
striving as they should, but we have enough of the “true 
metal” to fully maintain the county’s educational honor. 
What I say of our “ Reading Circle” must be partially pro- 
phetic. It is just budding into active life. Some of our best 
teachers have taken hold of the work with a determination 
that will not be easily overcome. Bedford County ought to 
organize and maintain one of the best reading circles in the 
State, and I believe it will be done. The evident necessity of 
the work proposed to be done by these reading circles ought to 
be sufficient to lead all teachers to a thorough, practical test of 
its work. 
The second session of our Normal Institute was held in June, 
and continued fifteen days. What was said of the work last 
 
-P-A-G-E-118
  (118) 
year might be truthfully repeated here. The attendance was 
good, and the work interesting and practical. As a result, the 
schools of the county are materially improved. After a prac- 
tical test of two years, our teachers are not willing to give up 
the Normal Institute. 
The colored teachers of this county are trying very hard to 
keep pace with the times. Their institute work continued four 
weeks. They labored under serious disadvantages, on account 
of the protracted illness of the teacher selected to conduct their 
class work, but his place was filled, the attendance was good, 
and the work has proved beneficial to their schools. 
BENTON COUNTY. 
D. J. Auten, SuPERINTENDENT, Camden. 
In compliance with the school law, I herewith transmit this, — 
my sixth annual report of the Benton County Schools. The 
scholastic year just closed, June 30th, 1886, has been progres- 
sive to some extent, notably in the adoption of a uniform sys- 
tem of text-books, and the organization of Teachers’ Reading 
Circles. Directors and teachers have generally been prompt in 
making their reports according to law; and the honorable 
County Court took upon themselves the responsibility of levy- 
ing an additional tax in order to have the schools of longer 
terms, the result of which will doubtless be shown in the next 
annual report, as we are just now receiving the benefits of the 
same, though the amount is yet insuflicient for a five months’ 
school. I have endeavored to keep up the Teachers’ Institutes, 
but they have not been as well attended as I desired, yet T 
‘trust there has been some good accomplished by those who 
have attended. I have always endeavored to visit my schools, 
and, in so doing, have endeavored to give the teachers and _ 
students encouragement. 
   
-P-A-G-E-119
    (119) 
  _ We need more money, which will make better teachers, bet- 
ter houses, desks and apparatus, and which will lead to more in- 
telligence aud better citizens. Ihave been in the school work 
until it is a part of my nature to feel a deep interest in the — 
future welfare of the citizens of ourState. There is one thing, 
however, that I will mention here. I failed to get a majority 
of our teachers to attend the Public Examination, which I en- 
deavored to carry out as you prescribed in your circular. Other 
items I might mention, but except those enumerated, there has 
_ been so little change since last report, that I deem it unneces- 
sary to tax your patience with them. 
Allow me now to thank you for your assistance and prompt- 
ness, which has always been a characteristic of your supervis- 
ion. 
BLOUNT COUNTY. 
A. M. Gampuz, SuperintenpEeNt, Maryville. 
In making this, my fourth and last annual report, I have but 
little to say outside my statistical report. 
Our school work is improving slowly. The voters take too 
little interest in the selection of directors, so it is difficult in 
some instances to prevail on a competent person to serve. 
A majority of our teachers are steadily improving, and are 
endeavoring to keep up with the times; but we have some 
fossilized teachers yet. 
Vocal music has been introduced into most of our schools, 
which I think destined to become popular. 
I will again suggest that you urge upon the coming Legisla- 
ture the importance of adding Physiology and Hygiene to the 
common school curriculum. ; 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
           (120 ) 
BRADLEY COUNTY. 
M. R. M. Burke, SupeRinteNDENT, Chatata. 
Inclosed you will find my annual report for the year ending 
June 30, 1886. The educational outlook in Bradley County is 
much better than ever before. In July, 1885, we organized a 
County Normal. In July, 1886, we continued three weeks, had 
thirty-eight teachers in attendance and agreed to have another 
in 1887. In the last two years, the value of public school prop- 
erty in the county has increased from $7,650 to $22,550, and 
preparations are being made to build four new houses. When 
they are done the county will be well supplied, with the excep- 
tion of one or two districts. We have appointed December Ist 
to meet, and have adopted a regular graded system for our 
public schools, and we also contemplate organizing a reading 
circle. 
CAMPBELL COUNTY. 
© W. J. McGur, Supermntenpent, Wellspring. 
In making this, my second report, it gives me satisfaction to 
say that the schools of Campbell County are at least twenty- 
five per cent. better than ever before; the attendance at least 
thirty per cent. better than last year. We have a moderate 
_ school tax. Nearly all of our tax-payers are in favor of good 
schools, and as a proof they attend all the Institutes and 
teachers meetings, and seem well pleased. One thing I have 
- noticed—that all of the school teachers love to attend these In- 
stitutes, and the directors will not employ the teachers who 
will not attend these meetings. As my report shows I have 
held in this school year seventeen two-day Institutes over 
the county, as suggested by Hon. T. H. Paine, State Superinten- 
dent. Wenever fail to have from eight to fifteen teachers, and 
in some instances have had the largest attendance that ever

_ We have over $8,000 in the Trustee’s hands. (121) 
_ ings we were favored by the presence of some of the best edu- 
cators in the county. 
CARROLL COUNTY. 
8. E. Tucker, Superinrenpent, Huntingdon. 
Thereby submit my fourth annual report of schools for the 
_ year ending June 30th, 1886. 
While everything has not prospered as I wished, the general 
work has been onward and an improvement over last year. 
Directors show more interest in their work. Nearly every 
school taught for the past year has been visited. We have 
erected several new, commodious buildings and furnished many 
of the old ones with new desks, plenty of blackboards, and 
other apparatus. 
Upon good, efficient, energetic directors hang the success of 
all our public schools. 
Our honorable County Court continues to levy the tax. 
Our teachers, young and old, have put in all their leisure mo- 
ments, and have consequently improved rapidly. They read 
_ educational journals, the Eclectic Manual of Methods, and other 
books on “ Theory and Practice.” 
Our district schools generally run two months in summer and 
three months in winter. The extreme winter cut the average 
off some this year. We have adopted a form of grading which 
has been of sume benefit, but it has not been observed as it should 
have been by many teachers and directors. A large number of 
the more interested and intelligent class of our directors met 
last December and re-adupted, or recommended, the Eclectic Ed- 
_ ucational Series of Text-books for five years, beginning Jan- 
a 3 
ake uary, 1886. The adoption has been a great benetit to the pupils” 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
  (122) 
of our county. It classifies, harmonizes and organizes the 
school, and saves the purchase of so many books by having one 
kind. 
Thad published in June and distributed a circular letter of 
instructions to directors and teachers, which aids greatly in my 
work. I try to visit all the schools once a year. I have made 
three efforts to organize a reading circle, but have so far failed. 
We will try again soon, and I think will succeed. 
CARTER COUNTY. 
A. J. F. Hyper, Supsrintenpent, Hyder. 
I have the honor herewith, to transmit my report for the 
year ending June 30th, 1886. The schools of this county, with 
few exceptions, were good. The teachers have taken greater 
interest in our Institutes than in any former year, and I am 
satisfied that great good has been accomplished by this means. 
There are some things very detrimental to the cause of educa- 
tion in this county. The meagerness of our school fund com- 
pels, the directors to pay small salaries, which has caused 
much of our best teaching talent to seek more remunerative 
fields. The lack of a uniform system of text-books is perhaps 
the greatest evil we have to contend with, although efforts are 
being made to remedy that evil. School facilities have been 
greatly improved since the beginning of last year. Many new 
school-houses have been erected, and some are now in process 
of erection, while nearly all the old ones have been repaired. 
On the whole I believe the prospect is very flattering. 
CHEATHAM COUNTY. 
R. S. Turner, SuPERINTENDENT, Ashland City. 
Our schools are improving. My report does not show alarge — ; 
increase in the number enrolled, but the attendance is better. a 
   
-P-A-G-E-123
    (123) 
  Our teachers are doing good work. We lack school-houses. 
Yet we are for free schools. Our people patronize them and 
depend upon them. You notice that our tax is equal to any in 
the State. I hear no complaint. Our teachers are mainly 
young men and women of energy and talent. We have an 
educational association intended to embrace the teachers,- 
school directors, and magistrates of our county. We meet. 
often and discuss school work. Our aim is to make every man 
know his work and do it. Good men accept the office of 
director, and even electioneer for it, This is a fine symptom. 
Favoritism in the employment of teachers is fading away. We 
are doing very well. Our County Court are school men, our 
directors are school men. Our teachers know how to work, 
and do work nobly under the circumstances. We need school- 
houses and school-furniture. I find in my rounds, good house, 
good attendance; bad house, poor attendance. I ask the sup- 
erintendents throughout the State if this is the case with them? 
If they answer yes, the remedy is plain. 
CHESTER COUNTY. 
J. 8. Wurtz, Superinrenpunt, Henderson. 
I forwarded my statistical report some days ago, which at 
this date appears tardy, but this tardiness must not be attributed, 
as has been usual, to the other school officers of the county. 
The reports of the trustees, directors, and the abstracts of the 
teachers were all in on time, and my report was almost com- 
plete eleven weeks ago, but sickness and an inability to write 
at all prevented its completion until within the last few days. 
The report is complete of every district and school in the 
county, and when compared with that of last year it shows — 
much that is encouraging. 
A careful visitation of the schools, together with the Insti- — 
tutes I have held, have been, in my opinion, of great advantage.
-P-A-G-E-124
(124 ) 
In these visitations and Institutes I have paid special attention 
to the instruction of directors and teachers as to their duty of 
reporting in time. 
I have subjected the teachers to a rigid public examination, 
and have assured those who barely passed that without im- 
provement they would be denied a certificate next time. I am 
glad to report that public sentiment is for the first time de- — 
manding efficient teachers. Indeed, I have done my very best 
to enthuse my teachers with a holy rage for learning and self- 
improvement, determined, as far as I had opportunity, to build 
up a corps of teachers who, coming from my people and of 
them, will carry the people with them in perfecting their 
mutual edueation. 
By comparing my statistical reports it will be seen that we 
have increased our enrollment at least one-half more than it 
was last year, and in all the advanced common school branches 
we have more than three times as many enrolled as we had last 
year. 
It will also be seen that our teachers at last have commenced 
to teach the Geology of Tennessee and the Elements of Agri- 
culture in our schools. I have also had Pages’ Theory and 
Practice of Teaching taught, and is now being taught in the 
schools of our county-seat to a class of forty or fifty young 
teachers by a skilled professor, free to the pupils, and I would 
here thank President J. B. Inman, of the West Tennessee 
Christian College for his ready zeal in introducing the work as 
a text-book. I believe almost every teacher in the county has 
studied the work within the last twelve months, and in my 
public examinations of teachers I have embraced almost every 
subject treated in the book, having adopted it as a standard on 
that subject. 
Next October I believe that this county will, in proportion to 
_ population, send up as commendable a report as any county in 
_ the State.

G. S. Mayes, Superintenpent, Bacchus. 
I again send in my annual report. I will say it is quite dif- 
ferent to what I expected; when I sent in my last year’s report. 
If I am not mistaken I said that I thought the County Court 
would levy a tax sufficient to run our schools at least five 
months out of the year. I was sadly disappointed in my ex- 
pectation. Allow me to say here that unless Claiborne gets , 
aid from some other source her schools will never be prosperous. ~ 
As you see by my report that her money is not sufficient to run 
her schools to any advantage. We have as good an average 
_ as could be expected, all we like is the money to run our schools 
longer. 
COFFEE COUNTY. 
C. N. Townsrnp, Supprintenpent, Manchester. 
I have no very marked changes to make in my last year’s re- 
port. While the school work of the present year has not been 
crowned with that success so much desired by the enthusiastic 
educator, yet it has moved along smoothly and in a progressive 
manner. When I consider for a moment the distressed finan- 
cial condition of our public school system, together with other 
hindering causes thereto, I am forced to say I am satisfied with 
the progress made, and that our schools have been a decided 
success. 
The public school system of Tennessee never had a deeper 
hold upon the hearts of our people than at present, and our 
outlook is growing more brilliant every year. In reporting this 
it is proper to say there is some opposition to our system of 
schools, but by no means is it so glaring asit was a few years ago- 
Tullahoma (always awake) has, with the brains and money of 
her most generous and enterprising citizens, within this year,
-P-A-G-E-126
        
(126 ) 
  “given form to a graded school, and erected a suitable building 
for same, that would be an honor to our larger cities. This 
school is now supplied with a splendid corps of teachers, and 
has an enrollment of about 400 pupils. What a bright future 
for the children of Tullahoma! These schools should be en- 
couraged throughout the State. 
The work done in our County Teachers’ Institute this year 
is an improvement on the work of any former year, and forms 
no small part of the educational advance made during the year. 
The work of this institute was commenced by the organization 
of a Summer Normal at Manchester, which opened on 23d of 
June and continued two weeks. This was the first Summer 
Normal ever held in Coftee County for a longer term than one 
day at a time, and you can safely imagine the amount of work 
necessary to secure its organization and success. That it was a 
success no one doubts who witnessed the work during the term. 
There were forty-three teachers enrolled, all of whom took 
part in the work. As usual, with few exceptions, our best 
teachers were on hand ready and willing to engage in work at 
the opening of the institute. I wish I could name them but 
space forbids. Suffice it to say, their work was all good and 
has aided materially in building up the schools of the county. 
Just after my last report to you I attempted to organize a 
County Reading Circle, but succeeded in getting only a few 
teachers to attend the organization. At the close of our Sum- 
mer Normal we organized with an enrollment of seventeen 
members, most of whom have procured the books necessary to 
the course of reading as outlined by the State board for the 
Reading Circles. To be brief, the Circle has not made much 
progress. I have made several calls for meetings, but teachers, 
from some cause, did not respond. I like the Circle, and 
believe it to be for the interest of all teachers to attend it. 
Those teachers, or rather school-keepers, who never attend 
institutes, or read educational journals, or books on “ Theory 
and Practice of Teaching,” find themselves far behind the ad- 
vanced teachers, and liable to be displaced at any time. 
  No better sign, in my opinion, of the healthy condition of 
our schools at present exists, than the interest taken in institute

     e displacement of that class of teachers who never 
age in this work. 
o have our schools meet the expectation and approbation of _ 
the anxious and ever inquiring public mind, they must be fur- t 
nished with competent, energetic, and wide-awake teachers, who 
e earnestly enlisted in their work, and who are always ready 
d willing to take the onward step in the great cause of pop- 
ular education. 
This report will close my career as Superintendent of the 
_ schools of this county.

_ The intelligence, refinement, prosperity, and wealth of all 
nations beneath the sun, are measured by their public school 
systems. This idea existed in the minds of the founders of this 
great Government in the dark days of 1776. From that time 
to the present, America’s greatest patriots and most illustrious 
_ statesmen, all the way down the line, have favored a system 
F of popular education adequate to the wants and necessities of 
the great masses of the people. Look at the great and good 
Washington, who bequeathed « part of his estate to the ad- 
_ vancement of the cause of education. The example of this 
great and good man has been followed by many other bright 
lights whose names are too tedious to mention. We must have 
d and encouragement to our schools, should be the watch- 
word of every Tennessean who loves our free institutions and 
beautiful form of government. 
CROCKETT COUNTY. 
M. T. Moors, Superintenpent, Gadsden. 
I herewith submit my report of the schools of Crockett 
_ County for the year ending June 20th, 1886. While I have not 
realized during the last scholastic year all that I hoped for and 
_ expected, I should, I suppose, to a great degree be satisfied
-P-A-G-E-128
  (128 ) 
  with the educational progress of the public schools in my 
county. The prejudice which has so long existed against the 
public schools is gradually wearing away, and the prospects for 
the future are brightening. 
DAVIDSON COUNTY. 
W. iH. Ferrets, Superintenpent, Nashville. 
In transmitting to you my annual report, it affords me some 
pleasure to note the many changes for good that have been 
wrought in the schools of our county. It is clearly evident 
that our schools are receiving aid and encouragement from all 
our people. The lamentable ery of the old croakers, “that 
public schools are only for poor white trash and niggers,” has 
been drowned in the tide of progress, and our schools nurtured 
and patronized by all. It is pleasant to visit our schools and 
find in the same class, and often on the same seat, children of the 
banker and the mechanic, striving with as much zeal to excel, 
and with as kind feelings as ever permeated the hearts of pu- 
pils. It seems that a new era is about to dawn, “with fairer 
skies and brighter suns,” for education in our county. One 
omen is, to see that our directors have almost buried into ob- 
livion the old favoritism system, that has been such a bane to 
our schools. It is truly encouraging to be able to report that 
our directors, with few exceptions, are employing the best 
teachers their limited means will afford. Another feature 
worthy of note is the improved condition of our houses. Dur- 
ing the past year, outside the city, we have seen erected one 
lovely brick, fourteen nice, well-ventilated frame, and one cozy — 
log school-house. These and many others have been seated with 
the improved desk. The teachers’ monthly meetings and 
Summer Normals have added very materially to our success. 
The Reading Circle is also a motor for good, All our best 
teachers attend the various school meetings, and have assisted 
 
-P-A-G-E-129
(129)     
      me very much with my work, for which I am very grateful. 
There are, however, a ‘‘ consequential few” who have never at- 
tended one of our meetings. They have never written one word 
to assist us; yet, by their manifest egotism, would have us be- 
lieve “that they were born teachers of the most improved 
style.” I hope to have meetings of the directors at least four 
times during the year. I am sure many of the existing evils 
will be eradicated by such meetings. The great barrier to pro- 
_ gress in our schools is a lack of funds. We have an increase 
of nearly 10,000 in scholastic population since 1877, yet our 
funds for school purposes, are only slightly increased, and that 
_ alone by an increase in value of property, the rate being the 
same. I am fully satisfied that our people will more readily 
assent to an increase of taxes for school purposes than for any 
other. They feel that taxes for educating our girls and boys, like 
vapors, rise to descend in showers to bless and beautify-the land. 
_ I feel that it would be ingratitude of the worst type to close 
_ this report without many thanks to Professors Garrett, Wool- 
wine, Goodman, Crandle, Webb, Rogers, Superintendent Zack 
_ Brown, yourself, and others, for valuable assistance during our 
institute and teachers’ meetings. We have all been inspired 
with new life, and firm resolutions to make this year the most 
successful in educational circles. We are sensitive of the fact 
 * that— 
      “ True worth is in being, not seeming; 
In doing each day that goes by, 
Some little good; not in dreaming 
Of great things to be done by and by.” 
It may not be out of place to state that at our last teachers” 
meeting “your administration was heartily indorsed, and al} 
our teachers for Col. T. H. Paine for State Superintendent.”

  DECATUR COUNTY. 
W. 4H. H. McMrzan, SUPERINTENDENT, Decaturville. 
I have the honor herewith to transmit my annual report of 
the schools of Decatur County. The report is as nearly cor- 
rect as I can make it from the papers in my office. I am grat- 
_ ified to say that the schools in our county are making some 
progress in the way of improvement. Our very efficient and 
worthy County Trustee makes prompt distribution of the school 
fund, and has his financial report ready in advance of the time 
specified by law. 
Our school work for the past year has moved quietly and 
smoothly on, without very much change in any way. 
Profs. M. R. Abernathy, W. B, Romine, and 8. A. Mynders 
held a State Normal Institute of five days duration at Decatur- 
ville last July. I think that they accomplished much good for 
the cause of education while here. The mectings were well 
attended by the people, though not very many teachers were 
present. 
DEKALB COUNTY. 
A. L. Matons, Surprintenpent, Temperance Hall. 
The public schools in this county for the past year have done 
exceedingly well, considering the limited amount of school 
funds. We have live, energetic teachers, but we do not have 
sufficient funds to keep them regularly employed. This, of © 
course, has a tendency to crush our teaching interest. Our 
schools, though, in the main, have been prosperous.

   I have the honor herewith to submit my second annual re- 
port. I would say that we are making some progress in our 
schools. We have a good many first-class teachers, both ladies 
and gentlemen, in this county, and they are doing some good 
work for the cause of education; but there is a class of people 
in this county who present themselves to teach school every 
year, and although honest, clever people, they are not up with 
the times, and consequently are a great drawback to our 
schools. ' 
We have had considerable confusion in several districts this 
year because the County Court divided the county into school — 
districts, or sub-districts, with three directors for the same. 
oe But our Attorney-General, B. D. Bell, ruled against the action 
_of the court, and since they have learned that your ruling in 
_ the matter is substantially the same as that of Mr. Bell, every- 
thing is quieted down and the schools are doing well. I have — 
visited all the schools in the county once or twice. 
DYER COUNTY. 
_ Davip E. McCorxxe, Supzrintenpent, Dyersburg. 
_ Lhave the pleasure of submitting herewith my statistical re- 
_ port of schools, which will speak for itself concerning the con- 
_ dition of our common schools in Dyer County. 
It is my humble belief that the public schools of Dyer are in 
a3 good, if not in better, working order at this time than they _ 
_ have ever been. 
It is a note- worthy fact that the masses of the people take a 
deeper interest in the education of our youth than ever before;
-P-A-G-E-132
  (182 ) 
and it is a most encouraging and hopeful evidence of progress 
that competent and well-informed teachers are being employed. 
School directors in most localities are beginning to realize 
that teachers who have no higher ambition than just to come 
into the community and teach a short school on a small salary 
merely to enable themselves to get somewhere else, are really 
the most costly teachers that can be employed; hence, we see 
with great pleasure more teachers in the public schools of this 
county holding diplomas and certificates of graduation from 
first-class colleges and normal schools than we have ever before 
witnessed. 
Formerly the County Superintendent was kept constantly 
busy finding teachers for schools; now teachers are constantly 
applying to me to find situations, and it is very seldom that I 
find a school that has not already arranged with the previous 
teacher for the next term. 
Iam very much gratified to note the marked improvement 
in the class of colored teachers who have been engaged the past 
year. Education among the negroes is on the upward incline. 
There is one great drawback to our public schools to which 
I would call your attention, that at the same time discourages 
and vexes the teacher and hinders the progress of the pupils. 
T allude to the want of uniformity of text-books. 
I think it would be well to have the law restored making the 
the County Superintendent’s signature necessary to the teacher’s 
order before he can draw his pay. By this means, and this 
only, can the Superintendent procure reports from the teachers, 
which are so necessary to enable him to get up his statistical 
report to the State Superintendent. 
I have visited the schools throughout the county this year, 
and have made public addresses wherever opportunity offered. 
All in all, the year has been a most prosperous one in our 
schools. May it ever be go.

FAYETTE COUNTY. 
W.J. Exam, Superinrenpent, Somerville. 
Again I have the honor to transmit herewith my annual re- 
port as County Superintendent of Public Instruction for the 
scholastic year ending June 30th, 1886. It is evident from the 
accompanying statistics that our public schools throughout the 
county are steadily advancing, both as to interest manifested on 
the part of the people and the work done by the teachers. Our~ 
financial condition is in good shape, not a single district but 
what had money in the treasury when the schools closed. 
Eight neat, comfortable school-rooms have been completed, 
with three or four more in course of erection. Since my last 
report our scholastic population has decreased nearly two hun- 
dred, yet the average daily attendance and enrollment is greater 
than at any former period. I find that issuing only two grades 
of certiticates is working finely, for there is a growing demand 
for enterprising, progressive teachers, and a disposition on the 
part of directors to procure the services of such at an increased 
salary. Our colored teachers are doing noble work for their 
race, and many conduct their schools with efficiency, and are 
always very prompt in attending examinations set apart for 
them. It has been customary for colored teachers to crowd 
here from Mississippi and other parts remote, but that day has 
passed, and there is no longer any demand for teachers from a 
distance. Everything has worked smoothly, and no dissatis- 
faction from any board or from any section has come to my 
knowledge, only the term is too short, and this is of itself quite 
an argument in favor of local aid. The outlook for the future 
is indeed hopeful; the current of public favor flows slowly but 
surely in the right direction.

FENTRESS COUNTY. 
I. F. Wrigut, SuperintEnDEent, Jamestown. 
The schools in Fentress County have made decided progress 
the present year. We have a better class of teachers than ever 
before; they are better qualified. More interest is taken in the 
cause of education than ever before; people are more willing 
to support the schools. 
The private schools haye made decided progress this year. 
The County Court levied a tax of 25 cents on the one hundred 
dollars worth of taxable property for the year 1886. 
T am in hopes that our Governor will appoint the same State 
Superintendent for the next term. 
FRANKLIN COUNTY. 
W. B. Warterson, SupERINTENDENT, Winchester. 
I beg leave to report better success than ever before attained ; 
more enthusiasm on the part of teachers, better attendance, 
‘improved facilities in the way of better school-houses, better 
furniture, etc. The great apparent need is a larger school 
fund, longer terms, etc. In no previous year have the schools 
given such general satisfaction. 
I think the duties of directors should be more clearly defined, 
they frequently farm out the schools, so to speak, giving the 
employment of teachers, as well as supervisers, to each other 
in the several parts of their districts, the others giving their 
assent to the arrangement. I think that all the directors should 
be present before any official business can be done. 
 
-P-A-G-E-135
  (185) 
  GIBSON COUNTY. 
A. Kitioven, SuPERINTENDENT, Zrenton. 
The schools of this county have perhaps done more efficient 
work this year than during any previous year. Though the 
number of pupils enrolled, as shown by my report, has not in- 
creased. While the scholastic population is considerably larger 
than it was last year, the small percentage of enrollment 
and the small average daily attendance is due largely to 
the colored population in the towns. There is a large col- 
ored population in Trenton, Humboldt, Milan, and in two | 
or three smaller towns of the county. There is a good col- 
ored school in each of these towns, but there are a great 
many worthless shiftless negroes, as there are in almost all 
towns, who take no interest whatever in schools, and suffer their | 
children to loaf around in idleness. The percentage of enroll- — 
ment, and the average daily attendence in the white schools, 
and in the colored schools outside of the towns, though not as 
large as it should be, is steadily growing larger. There is a 
marked improvement in the regularity of attendance, and as a __ 
consequence the schools are better organized and the pupils 
better classified. There are a number of graded school, and a 
great many schools not marked on my report as graded schools 
are partially graded. I hope to see them develop into regular 
graded schools at an early date.. 
The directors, as a rule, are more attentive to their respective 
schools. They visit them oftener, and manifest more interest in 
teachers’ meetings held from time to time throughout the 
county, than they have in former years. 
Prohibiting the issuance of third grade certificates has cut off 
a few incompetent favorites and relatives of school officials, — 
who sought a certificate merely to draw the money, and cared 
little how low the grade was. There is a greater demand 
_ though, for good teaching than’ has ever before existed, and it 
would be hard for a teacher with a third grade certificate to get 
employment at all, under ordinary circumstances, even if third 
grade certificates were allowed. ‘Teachers holding first grade 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
  (136 ) 
certificates command a much better price for their services than 
those holding second grade certificates. More money has been 
paid for the salaries of teachers this year than ever before in 
one year. Though the quantity of teaching has not been in- 
creased, yet the quality has improved. A number of teachers’ 
meetings, as shown by my statistical report, have been held in 
the county this year. There are a great many young teachers 
in the county—in fact a majority of our schools are taught by 
young teachers. They exhibit a considerable interest in teach- 
ers’ mectings, and to these meetings may be partly attributed 
very much of the improvement of the teaching force. They 
have contributed largely, too, towards increasing the demand 
for better teaching. Meetings have been held in almost every 
community once a mouth during the summer and fall. The 
study of teachers’ literature has thus been encouraged and I 
feel warranted in saying that more school journals have been 
read and more books on the science of teaching, the structure of 
the mind, etc., have been studied by the teachers of this county 
during this year than any ten years previous. The study of 
methods forms part of the work of every teacher. The people 
are becoming more and more interested on the subject of edu- 
eating their children. 
Good school-houses provided with all necessary conveniences 
are the pride of every neighborhood. 
The Public School system of Gibson is undoubtedly a suc- 
cess. 
GILES COUNTY. 
H. G. ABernatuy, SUPERINTENDENT, Aspen Hill. 
I submit to you my second annual report of the public schools 
of Giles County. 
The additional tax levied in 1885 has enabled us to run our 
schools for four months, and in nearly every district there is a 
 
-P-A-G-E-137
(187 ) 
  surplus of funds that will run the schools for two months 
longer. 
The State Institute for the colored teachers, held here last 
summer, was a decided success, both in attendance and interest 
by the teachers. 
My report will give my official work. 
May our gallant mountain boy, Robert L. Taylor, Governor- 
elect, re-appoint Hon. Thos. H. Paine State Superintendent of 
Public Instruction. 
GREENE COUNTY. 
W. T. Gururie, Supprintenpent, Mosheim. 
The Greene County Normal Institute did a noble work last 
year. The attendance was not so good at any time as desired, 
but a deeper interest was awakened in every part of Greene 
County where these institutes were held and so far as their in- 
fluences extended. Iam most happy to report that I have the 
hearty co-operation and cordial support of all the best teachers 
and other friends of free public education. Our watch-word is 
“Onward ;” our motto, “Be Prudent, but Firm.” 
Weare sorry to report that in some communities there was 
a noticeable lack of appreciation. This lack seems to arise 
from a misunderstanding of the objects and aims of our public 
school system. 
We must not forget to say that we are steadily advancing 
year by year, and we are made to believe that if every teacher 
_ would discharge his duties fully that the opposition to free 
public schools would almost entirely give way. The outlook 
for the scholastic year 1886-87 is most encouraging. 
The school directors of Greene County have organized and 
meet quarterly. The directors in some of the districts say they 
intend to visit the schools of their district in a body before the
-P-A-G-E-138
   (188 ) 
next directors’ meeting and report the progress their schools 
seem to be making at said meeting. 
Just here permit me to say that I do most earnestly hope 
that the next Legislature will make some very important 
changes in the public school laws of Tennessee. 
Our present system is now in her “teens.” Hence, we think 
she is strong enough to bear a few more studies. 
The approximate number belonging to each school should be 
defined bylaw. I think from fifty to seventy-five is enough for 
a country school. In cities and towns there should be one 
teacher for every sixty pupils belonging. In this way every 
community would have equal advantages, and the tearing down 
system would be abolished. 
Do we need a healthful compulsory law? 
From recent observations made in visiting the various school 
districts in Greene County I have been thoroughly convinced 
that we need such a law—one that could be applied to stubborn. 
cases. 
Normal schools are now considered indispensable. I do not 
think that any teacher who cannot present a certificate of at- 
tendance of at least five days (except excused by sickness) 
should be admitted to apply for a certificate. 
But, I must close this report by saying that Greene County 
will continue to be found in the advance. May every county 
in this noble State more firmly resolve to move steadily on to 
conquest and to victory. 
All of which is most respectfully submitted.

We organized a Reading Circle and Teachers’ Institute on the 
_ 28th of December, 1885. 
  These meetings have been held monthly, and have proven to 
; be very interesting and instructive to teachers. 
The County Court levied a good school tax, and the prospects 
for good schools in Grundy County were never better. 
HAMILTON COUNTY. 
H. B. Heywoop, Superintenpent, Chattanooga. 
I have the honor to submit my annual report for 1885-86. 
Our schools are in a good condition, with enrollment, atten- 
dance, general interest, and school work, all kept up to a fair 
- and advancing standard. Our Teachers’ Institutes have been 
well attended, and much good work has been done in them. 
To them may be truly attributed a great improvement in teach- 
ing, with knowledge of the several common school branches 
more thoroughly acquired by the children. It would be of 
great service to the schools for the Legislature to aid and en- 
courage these teachers’ meetings so that they may become 
certain and permanent in all the counties of the State. In 
closing this report I trust I may be pardoned in saying that the 
courtesy and promptness attending the transaction of my busi- 
ness with the State Superintendent’s office, has been eminently 
satisfactory and pleasant to me, and also that the State super- 
visiop has been on a high plane, efficiently working the common 
school system on and up.

  (140 ) 
It affords me great pleasure to report the improvements made, 
not only in school-room, but in the erection and improvement 
of the school-houses. Many of them have been improved by 
means of private subscription, thereby diminishing public ex- 
_ pense. 
My report is as nearly correct as possible for me to make it. 
There being no means of forcing teachers to return abstracts, 
some are remiss in doing so. ‘ 
In many of our schools I find in successful use many sug- 
gestions offered at the State Normal Institute held at Morris- 
town, in our county, last summer. 
Numbers of the teachers seem to have received new inspira- 
tions, increased enthusiasm, and stronger desires to be better 
teachers. 
In the same school the same teacher is doing more efficient 
work than last year. 
We trust all East Tennessee was benefited by your presence, 
as well as that of those accompanying you. 
The grade of our teachers has greatly advanced. Most of 
them are live and progressive. 
Our directors are becoming more interested in the work. 
Seeing the need of common education, they rally to my assist- 
ance, working from a patriotic stand-point; and it is to them 
a vast deal of the improvement is due. 
Our institute work goes on as last year, with a better attend- 
ance of the people as well as teachers. 
I should do our colored teachers an injustice not to speak of 
them. In the advancement they come boldly on. Most of 
them are earnest, zealous workers, doing all in their power for 
their race. Among them are some of our best disciplinarians. 
Much to the disadvantage of their schools, in many places there 
are so few of them as to make their schools very short. Some 
are so far away that they do not attend at all. The directors 
do the best they can for them. 
One very great disadvantage to our schools is that, by some, 
they are regarded as “a poor man’s affair;”” but we are glad to —

   his idea breaking down, and many of those formerly ene- 
mies to the public schools now coming to its relief. When 
the time will have come that men will look upon the schools, 
not as an individual, but as a general interest, the objections 
against them will cease, and they must, of necessity, be more 
- efficient. 
In some districts, where the people have not been sending, 
the teachers go “out into the highways and hedges” and in- 
vite them in. 
We are looking to the adoption of a uniform system of books 
in our county, and shall be glad to have any suggestion you 
may give us on the matter. At our last institute the teachers 
passed resolutions to this effect. We earnestly feel that for us 
a new day is dawning. 
Allow me to suggest that I do not believe the scholastic 
population of the State as large as represented to you to be. I 
do not charge any one of unfairness; but it is by mistake. I 
find children living along district lines enumerated in both dis- 
tricts; and sometimes those living near corners are enumerated 
in as many as three districts. This demands the careful con- 
sideration of directors. 
I close this report by saying that the Legislature ought to 
give some law by which teachers can be forced to return ab-

I am proud to state the fact that the schools of my county 
_ are much better this year than for a long while; in fact, I think, 
much better than I have ever known them; but this, I think, is 
easily accounted for from the simple reason our county has 
never had a Normal until this year, and nothing has ever tended.

to stimulate our schools, and invigorate our teachers more, I 
don’t think. In addition to this I have, and am yet holding, 
what are called Teachers’ Institutes, which is doing much to im- 
prove the methods of teaching, etc. Also we have adopted a 
uniform series of text-books, which if put in use will add much 
to the advancement of our schools. 
HARDIN COUNTY. 
Wit J. Watson, SupERINTENDENT, Savannah. 
In making this, my second annual report of the condition of 
the schools of my county, I find a very great lack of data from 
which to get a correct statistical report; consequently the 
receipts and expenditures columns are only estimates of what 
I think they should be. This is mainly the result of the County 
Trustee failing to report as the law requires him to do. 
There is a marked improvement in the school work. The 
most noticeable feature is the organization of a County Direct- 
ors’ Institute. This institute was organized in October, 1885, 
with Esq. E. D. Martin, President, and Prof. H. P. Wood, of 
Hardin College, Secretary. Under the management of these 
gentlemen the organization has been of infinite value to both 
teachers and directors—enabling them to co-operate in the 
great work of education. The directors are the controlling 
power in the public schools, and it is proper for them to have 
an organization in order to successfully carry out the intention 
of the school law. If County Superintendents throughout the 
State would organize these institutes, they will find them to be 
a great aid in the management of the schools, by taking a large 
per cent. of the responsibilites off the Superintendents, and en- 
_ abling themselves to meet and discuss the public school law, and 
their various duties as school directors.

herewith submit the annual report of the schools of Harde- 
man County for the year ending June 30th, 1886. I was elected 
st April to fill out the term of A. J. Coates, Esq., resigned. 
8 my predecessor failed to collect the teachers’ abstracts, I am 
unable to report the enrollment. While our schools are not 
what they should be, yet the past year has been one of many 
improvements. 
“Many of our school-houses are inferior and badly located, our 
shool term too short, our salaries meager, and many of our 
teachers are ignorant of the cardinal principles of true teach- 
ing. I have been faithful in trying to raise the grade of 
teachers, and have succeeded well. I rejected about 25 per 
cent. of all the applicants. Nearly all of our best teachers are 
_ young teachers, some of whom are the peers of any young 
_ teachers in the State. 
My institutes have been well attended, and great interest 
manifested on the part of citizens and teachers. 
Our Reading Circle, organized last spring, has twenty mem- 
bers. 
Nine months ago the Southwestern Journal of Education had 
only one subscriber in the county, but now it has about fifteen. 
In visiting the schools I found a great diversity of text- 
_ books; some new books of high merit, but many old books of 
old series. I am striving to have a uniform series of new or 
revised text-books adopted. 
Our able State Superintendent favored this county with one 
of the three State Normal Institutes held in West Tennessee 
last summer. It was conducted on the plan of general class 
work, and the various subjects and topics were well presented 
by Profs. F. M. Smith, A. P. Bourland, J. L. Lampson, and E, 
W. Price. It tinued one week, and was well attended, es- 
pecially at night, when the ee Circuit Court-room was 
densely crowded to hear the popular addresses, excellent essays,
-P-A-G-E-144
    (144 ) 
- recitations, and music. The crowning event of the week was 
the unanswerable argument of the State Superintendent in be- 
half of public education. The sixty teachers who attended the 
institute went home with a new zeal for their work; and the 
next annual report from this county will, I think, show that 
the spirit of free education has been “ up and doing.” 
HAWKINS COUNTY.

In submitting herewith my report, I am gratitied to be able 
to say that I think our schools have been better this year than 
any other since I have been connected with them. 
HAYWOOD COUNTY. 
W. R. Lutan, SupERINTENDENT, Brownsville. 
I herewith inclose my approximately correct statistical re- 
port. Taking into consideration our many disadvantages, our 
schools are doing remarkably well. Opinion generally grow- 
ing in favor of common schools, but the disproportion between 
the tax-payers and the non-tax-payers—the white and colored— 
the disproportion between the two about the same—affects it. 
‘Want of money is the greatest disadvantage. Third-rate pay 
for first-class teachers, is a great drawback to the schools; 
still, we are struggling on, hoping for the best. Fewer school 
districts, with fewer and paid directors, would bring about a 
great improvement. 
Our teachers preferred not to have an institute this year, but 
hope to have one next summer, when we expect and desire to 
have you with us.

HENRY COUNTY. 
W. B. VANcLEAVE, SUPERINTENDENT, Paris. 
   
    Lherewith submit my tenth annual report as Superintendent 
of Public Schools of Henry County. 
Our schools have done well this year. They have continued 
for about five months. We have enrolled 5380 more this year 
than last. 
We have had 131 schools in this county during the year. 
We have some very good schvol-houses in this county, and 
the directors have supplied a good many with good patent. 
desks, which is a very great advantage. 
Non-attendance and irregular attendance are great draw- 
backs to our free schools. Give us a compulsory school law. 
This alone will educate all of our children in the State. 
T have visited 125 schools, and delivered as many addresses. 
My report has, in part, been made from my note-book, made 
while visiting the schools. In visiting the schools I have care- 
fully noted the general condition and management of our public 
_ schools, and, after a critical review of facts, I am prepared to 
say that the schools as a general thing are progressing fairly, 
considering the disadvantages under which many of them labor. 
One great obstacle in the way is the lack of suitable houses 
and apparatus. Another great drawback is that every man 
_ wants a public school at his door. We are trying to support 
too many schools to the square mile for many of them to prosper. 
We had a County Institute at Cottage Grove in July, through- 
out the entire week immense crowds filled the house night and 
day, sometimes to overflowing. The exercises were exceedingly 
interesting and beneficial. Prof. A. P. Bourland, of Jackson, 
Tenn., was the instructor, and he succeeded most admirably in 
making the institute a grand success. Its effects will be seen 
_ days to come.

  (146 ) 
   I think that liberal provisions ought to be made by law for 
county institutes, and force every teacher to attend or forfeit 
his or her certificate. 
I am in favor of the Legislature passing a law adopting a 
uniform system of text-books for five or more years. The Leg- 
islature ought to regulate by law the minimum number of | 
children to constitute a legal school district. In parts of this 
county the interest is very materially damaged by very small _ 
districts. My experience is that no school district ought to 
have less than sixty children in it. Have the Legislature to 
enact a law that will give the County Superintendent well defined 
authority, and require of him the performance of specific duties. 
    Iam of the opinion that the County Superintendents shoald 
settle with the Trustees monthly, and receive the money, and 
thus become the disbursing agents of the school fund. Do this; — 
require them to give a good and suflicient bond for the money — 
likely to come into their hands; then the money can be kept — 
separate, and not require the Trustee to make a report; as it is 
he will not make it. 
We have organized a ‘“ Reading Circle” in this county; we 
meet monthly and have a good time. 
I think the Legislature ought to fix, by some means, the — 
salary of the County Superintendent, or at least fix a minimum. _ 
I trust you may find it necessary and practicable to hold an 
institute in our county sometime during next year. 
In conclusion I would say that I have discharged my duties 
the very best I could regardless of the small salary allowed me is 
_ by the County Court. 
  My report has been made from actual personal effort in visit- _ 
ing the school, and can be relied upon. I trust it may give : 
satisfaction. yee     
     I wish every child in our beloved country a liberal education; 
“and that Capt. Thomas H. Paine may long remain our State 
Superintendent.

schools of this county. 
Che schools in this county are doing reasonably well, con- 
dering the embarrassing circumstances under which the
-P-A-G-E-148
  (148 ) 
teachers have to labor. We are blessed with a goodly number 
of efficient teachers, many of them having diplomas from the — 
best normal colleges in the country. I also think I am safe in 
saying that our school buildings are much in advance of our 
sister counties. A school-house has recently been erected in 
one of the rural districts of this county at a cost of $2,500. 
Our school funds are not sufficient to run our schools over 
three months during the year. 
JACKSON COUNTY. 
N. M. Cox, Superintrenpent, Gainesboro. 
The schools in my county have all been in good condition 
—had no trouble whatever. Teachers have been very vigilant 
in their duties, and the only thing in our way as a hindering 
cause, is the lack of money. If we could have just double the 
amount we now have, under the same supervision, we could 
have respectable schools throughout our county. There has 
been a considerable increase in the daily attendance in our 
county over any former year. Hence this shows that all have 
become more concerned—both parents, teachers, and pupils, 
not saying anything for myself. What we need is money suffi- 
cient to run our free schools ten months in every year. 
JAMES COUNTY. 
J. HE. Tattant, SUPERINTENDENT. 
You will notice from my report that our schools havemadecon- _ 
siderable progress. While our scholastic population hasinereased 
but little, yet the number of children enrolled in the public 
schools, as well as the number in regular attendance, has in- — 
 
-P-A-G-E-149
(149)      creased beyond our expectation. The increase in enrollment 
_ and average attendance has almost doubled the increase in pop- 
ulation during the past year. We think thisis due to the efforts” 
of our educational workers, and-to the systematic course of 
lectures delivered by the Superintendent as he visited the dif- 
ferent schools of the county. : 
- Our schools are all taught during the summer and the fall 
seasons, hence we are in the midst of our work which we think 
will show an advance upon the past. At the beginning of our 
schools for this season, certain rules and regulations were 
adopted for the government of the public schools of James. 
County. The teachers pledged themselves to enforce these 
rules, which will certainly help to secure a much-needed sys- 
tem in our educational work. On account of rigid examina- 
tions, several old teachers have stepped aside for new ones. 
Whether the change has been for the better or not, time will 
prove. f

I am very much gratified to say that our teachers are taking 
the interest in the public schools of our county as they should, 
_ and our schools are in a most prosperous condition. I have 
succeeded in having adopted for our county an entire new series 
of text-books, and have succeeded in placing them in nearly all 
the schools of Johnson County. I am sure we will have them 
placed in all the schools at an early date, then we can have a 
perfect uniform series of text-books. The four weeks Normal 
conducted at Mountain City through the month of July, did 
much in stimulating the school interests, and our teachers are 
begining to see the importance of thoroughly qualifying them- 
selves for this great duty. 
KNOX COUNTY. \ Vel

. ‘ \ \: 
T herewith submit iny secondhannual report of Knox County 
for the scholastic year ending June 30th, 1886. 
Although we have not accomplished all we hoped during the 
year, still our)school record shows an increase of school interest, 
population, enrollment, daily attendance, and more system in 
our schools than any previous year in the history of our county. 
During the past year we have built five large, neat frame 
school-houses, have painted and furnished them with the nec- 
essary apparatus and with the improved desks. The total ex- 
pense amounted to $3,700. Have also painted and repaired 
several other school-houses. Our school population has in- 
creased 761 for 1886, the enrollment 1,875, and the daily at- 
tendance 1,250 since my last report, which shows a considerable 
waking up by all in the school interest of our county. This” 
increase is due mainly to the enthusiasm aroused in teachers’ 
institutes. In the month of July, before the schools opened, I 
held a “ Normal Institute” of four weeks (three weeks for the 
 
-P-A-G-E-151
   
       
     
         ‘ I also held six Teachers’ In- 
stitutes, of two days Gach, while the schools were in operation ; 
ninety-six teachers were in attendance, about sixteen at each 
institute. I made out and published the programme two weeks 
before each meeting and assigned work to teachers in certain 
_ grades, representing all the grades in each institute. 
I visited 125 schools and delivered an address of about 
twenty minutes to each.. In those where the teachers were too 
: lenient I took charge of the school and reorganized it, and tried 
_ to impress the pupils with the importance of becoming orderly, 
and of doing good work. I have been very much pleased with 
the result of my work in that line. 
Knox County Teachers’ Reading Circle, while it has not ac- 
complished as much as we anticipated, it has made tolerably 
good progress. Our membership has reached thirty-five, and is 
_ now growing in interest. All the members express themselves 
as being pleased with the “circle” and the books adopted by 
the State Board of Education for the first year’s work. ~ 
    Our grading system is progressing very successfully. Last 
spring we found it necessary to revise our “ Course of Study 
and Rules for the Government of the Schools,” and make some 
slight changes. We had a large number printed and a copy 
placed in every household in the county. Prior to its appear- 
ance a very small per cent. of those who sent their children to 
the public schools knew what they were required to do. It has 
the effect, however, of bringing about a general understanding 
between parents, teachers, and pupils. 
  The amount of money we receive for school purposes is not 
sufficient to run our schools long enough. The County Court 
was kind enough to increase our school tax from 15 cents on 
the one hundred dollars worth of property to 20 cents. Still, 
that is not enough; our schools ought to continue eight months 
in the year. :

is observable that the length of schools in days has fallen off;

creased. The average attendance is also small in proportion to 
enrollment. I urge the passage of a law which will enlarge 
the curriculum of public school studies.

LAWRENCE COUNTY. 
   W. K. Lackey, SupERINTENDENT, St. Joseph. 
¥ 
I have the honor and pleasure to send you this, my fourth 
annual written report in regard to the condition of the public 
schools in my county. 
In making this report it is not my desire in the remotest to 
boast of anything that I have performed in the interest of the 
schools during my four years in office. If there has been any 
progress or improvement in our county schools in that time 
(which is clearly shown in comparing the statistical reports of 
1883 and 1886), I do not claim any more credit for it than what 
is due me (if any). But in justice to my fellow-workers in the 
great cause we espouse, I would most profoundly acknowledge 
the many and heavy obligations I am under to them for the 
aid, the encouragement, the kind co-operation. and the broth- 
erly sympathy which they have extended to me at every step 
and through every difficulty along our arduous pathway. As 
a general thing, school officials and teachers have performed 
their parts well; and too much credit cannot be given them 
for the present good condition of our public schools, especially 
financially, as every district in the county has more or less 
public school funds left over and due from last year. 
_ Our teachers, too, are improving rapidly as the years roll 
past. The grade this year is higher and better than has ever 
before been known in Lawrence County. And there seems to 
be almost a universal desire among the teachers to perform 
more and better work each term than they did the term pre- 
ceding; and especially to do more efficient service than their 
predecessors. 
One feature, however, is still prevailing to a very good extent, 
namely, non-attendance; yet there has been a considerable — 
gain in this item during the past three years. Too many peo- 
ple are careless in this respect, and I presume it is needless to _ 
repeat that a “compulsory law” is the only thing to completely 
 
-P-A-G-E-154
    (154 ) 
remove this great wrong so frequently perpetrated upon bright- 
eyed children, left to grope their way through life in darkness. 
Many a noble young mind, for the want of such a law, has been 
dimmed and crushed forever! When will our law-makers act 
on these important matters ? 
As you have seen by my statistical report, which I sent some- 
time ago, we held four County Institutes last autumn, which I 
think accomplished much good for our teachers and others whe 
attended, We will hold several perhaps this year, and at 
present the outlook indicates that great interest will be taken 
in the subjects to be discussed. 
Before closing this report, permit me to submit a few figures 
on items, showing at a glance, the progress we have made in 
some of the work of our schools in the last three years.

This will suffice to show whether we are making any progress & any prog 
or not in the schools of our county. 
In conclusion, I would not forget to mention the noble and ~ 
manly promptness of the members of our County Court in 
levying a liberal tax for the support of our schools; and the 
willingness and patience on the part of the people at large, in 
silently bearing this additional taxation for the sake of longer 
terms. ll praise to the friends of Popular Education. |

MACON COUNTY. 
Avery Haruan, Surermnrenpent, Lafayette. 
I herewith transmit my statistical report for the scholastic year 
ending June 30th, 1886. 
‘ Our schools are run under many disadvantages, which must 
be removed before they can accomplish the desired results. 
I am decidedly in favor of a law compelling parents and 
guardians to send their children to the schools. They are forced 
by law to pay taxes for the support of the public schools, and 
why not the same power and authority be exercised in bring- 
ing the children of the country into these schools to receive the 
instructions so necessary in fitting and preparing them for the 
duties of life? But with all the disadvantages, I am glad to 
report that there are visible signs of improvement in our 
schools. I have held written examinations entirely, and think 
much good has been accomplished by that course, especially 
among the young teachers of our county. We have a better 
corps of teachers now than ever before. 
Although there has been much repairing and several new 
houses put up this year, we are anxious to see the good work 
go on until each district in our county shall have a neat school- 
house, and it well furnished. I have tried all the time, and in 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
  (156 ) 
every way to carry out the spirit of the law, and while I have 
had considerable success, and with a great degree of pride call 
attention to the condition of the public schools to-day, yet I 
am satisfied that much more good could have been accomplished 
by close and untiring work. 
MADISON COUNTY. 
W. G. Cockrint, SupeRintenDENt, Jackson. 
In presenting this, my sixth annual report, it being for the 
school year ending June 30th, 1886, I am sorry to say is not as 
conmrplete as I desired to make it. Some of our district clerks 
have failed to report their schools, and about one-third of the 
teachers their abstracts. Notwithstanding these delinquencies 
in my school officers and teachers, Iam, owing to my long ex- 
perience in the County Superintendent’s office and general 
knowledge of the schools in my county, able to suppy many of 
these imperfections. 
This year our schools averaged 120 days; heretofore 100 days 
was our best average. 
I would respectfully recommend the following changes in the 
school laws: 
First. Re-enact the law requiring County Superintendents to 
approve school warrants, ete. 
Second. Enact a law that will give County Superintendents 
well defined authority and power to cause the school law to be 
properly executed, leaving, however, his decisions subject to an 
appeal to the State Superintendent, who will doubtless confer 
with the State Attorney-General in all doubtful cases. This I 
think will cut off school law-suits. 
Third. Enact a law fixing the compensation of County 
Superintendents per capita on the scholastic population of his 
county.

MARSHALL COUNTY. 
J. B. Haves, SuPERINTENDENT, Lewisburg. 
I have the honor herewith to submit my second annual re- 
port. I congratulate myself that I am able this year to offer a 
report substantially accurate. Last year—my first year—I re- 
ceived reports from but few districts, and consequently was 
compelled to rely mainly on notes taken while making visits for 
the facts contained in my report. I began then to urge upon 
all directors the importance of making their reports promptly, 
and I always refused to issue a warrant for their services till 
their full reports were handed in; and I also urged them 
not to issue a warrant for the teacher’s last month’s salary until 
the teacher should file with the clerk his abstract. By these 
means, I am happy to state, I have a complete report this year 
_ from every district in the county, fifty-nine in number. 
During the year I visited all the schools once, and a few of 
them twice. I also held an institute in July continuing ten 
days. It was conducted on the class method. We were also. 
entertained, as well as instructed, by such lecturers as Dr. Bas- 
kerville, Professor Savage, and Professor Hackett. Nearly 
every teacher in the county attended. Two young men from 
Fisk conducted an institute at the same time for the colored 
teachers. I also convened the teachers in an institute upon the 
same plan one day in each month. 
I organized in November a Teachers’ Reading Circle with 
about twenty-five members, which number was afterward consid- 
erably increased. This I regard as the greatest institution yet 
conceived for the masses of the teachers. Our circle is still: 
flourishing, and we expect to spare no pains to make it a per- 
manent institution in this county. 
During the close of this scholastic year I began earnestly to 
work to secure the adoption by the districts of a plan to grade 
the schools, and I have since been much gratified to know that 
a number have adopted it. I herewith transmit a copy of the 
system. 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
        (158 ) 
The schools are progressing. Nearly every district has a 
comfortable building. The teachers, as a rule, are live and en- 
ergetic. The people are gradually awaking to a knowledge of 
the fact that universal education is a myth except under a free 
school system, that the education of its poor is the State’s 
most high and sacred duty; and hence our public schools are 
gradually growing in favor.

June 30th, 1886. In some particulars it is, I think, correct; 
but in others, from the failures of directors to make full re- 
ports, I fear it is not. This has been a successful year for our 
schools, more, perhaps, than any preceding year. There has 
been a greater effort on the part of teachers to prepare them- . 
selves for their work. More interest shown by parents and 
guardians. Nearly all the teachers in private and high schools 
are giving us their aid in our common school work. The in- 
stitute work is growing in favor with all, and is an important 
factor in preparing good teachers and bringing the people in 
closer sympathy with the teachers. 
MEIGS COUNTY. 
W. B. McKeown, Superinrenpent, Decatur. 
- My report for this year is more correct than it was last. I 
have a report from the County Trustee and all the directors, 
_and abstract reports from most of the teachers. I obtained my 
 
-P-A-G-E-159
          (159 ) 
teachers’ abstracts this year with comparatively little trouble. 
They were stirred up considerably last year on examination, 
since which time they have been preparing themselves in school 
work. Their labors this year have been characterized by energy 
and positiveness. 
_ Theld a Normal Institute of five days in July, in which Prof. 
G, C. McKenzie, Vice-President of Dayton Masonic College, 
rendered me valuable assistance. The teachers of the county 
were well represented and much interested, and the continued 
a good attendance of the town and surrounding country showed 
that the interest was awakened beyond the ranks of teachers. 
A resolution was passed by the teachers to have a ten days’ 
Normal next year. The teachers had their energies greatly 
aroused, and carried this new zeal with them to their work.. 
Our county voted in August for a tax to prolong the public 
schools. This, with some other contemplated changes, will 
give schools from four to five months. I shall also insist upon — 
the directors having our schools to open in November, instead 
of August, as at present. 
We now have a uniform series of books recommended for 
our county. 
We have organized a Teachers’ Reading Circle for the county. 
_ This is a step toward advancement, for it brings the teachers 
- into kindly relation with each other and encourages general 
reading. 
All considered, I think our schools are in a much better con- 
dition than they have been. There isa growing feeling through- 
out the county in favor of them, and the people have taxed 
themselves for their support. The County Court will pay the 
next Superintendent enough to allow him to use his whole en- 
ergies toward keeping up and spreading this interest. Our 
schools can be made such that every citizen of the county will 
be proud of them.

  McMINN COUNTY. 
I. R. Lowry, Superintenvent, Riceville. 
I have the honor herewith to submit to you my second annual 
report as Superintendent of McMinn County. 
During the year I have carefully noted the progress and 
general condition of our schools, and after a critical review of 
facts I am prepared to say that, under the circumstances, our 
schools are progressing finely. A great improvement over last 
year in most every respect, except financially. Last spring I 
called a meeting of the directors for the purpose of adopting a — 
uniform system of books, which was done. They also adopted 
a “System of Grades,” and “Rules for the Regulating of our 
Schools,” and, I am glad to say, there is a marked improve- 
ment in our schools by adopting this uniformity, ete. 
A “ Teachers’ Institute’? was held in this county last June, 
under the supervision of Prof. Wilford Caulkins, A. M., of the 
“ Chattanooga University,” continuing ten days, in which many 
subjects pertaining to our common schools were ably discussed 
by our teachers, and thus a free interchange of thought has 
proved a blessing to our schools. While we have many disad- 
vantages to contend with, we are making use of all the means 
within our reach as best we can. Our people know that the 
public school system is their main dependence, in a great 
measure, and the yare untiring in their efforts to make every 
year an improvement on the past. I am sure with such senti- 
- ments manifested we will have better success in the future than 
we have ever had in the past. ©

J. M. Hicks, Superintenpent, Madisonville. 
I herewith transmit my second annual report. My schools 
are progressing very nicely—a larger attendance and longer 
sessions reported this year than usual. We are getting better

ses and better furniture each year. Our county will soon 
supplied with very respectable frame buildings. I expect 
e next annual report will show a falling off in the attendance 
caused by sickness. 
You will see that our schools ran eighty-four days this year 
against seventy-seven on last year, an increase of seven days, 
nd I think it will increase this year in the same ratio. 
We need more money and a uniform system of text-books, 
which we have been trying to get, and will get when the people 
become more fully awake in educational matters. 
MONTGOMERY COUNTY. 
J. Miuuer, SupERINTENDENT, Clarksville. 
The school interest in the county is better, and the people are 
more earnest and active in their support of the schools than 
ever before. They realize the fact that the schools can be made 
efficient, and they are taking hold of the matter with zeal and 
energy. Iam gratified to state that most of our teachers and: 
_ directors are zealous in the discharge of their duties, and the 
_ schools are in a very prosperous condition. Many of onr teach- 
ers read good educational journals, and are preparing for higher 
and better work. Our enrollment in the schools this year is the 
: highest ever known in the county; but, in consequence of the 
extreme severity of the weather last winter, the average daily 
attendance is not altogether as good as it was last year. 
  We have built seven good school-houses this year, and other _ 
districts are preparing to build. We are in a good financial 
condition. We are entirely free from school debt, with a bal- 
ance of $18,313.34 on hand June 30th, 1886, $2,729.01 more than — 
we had on hand at same date last year. :

management of the school fund. We have a better grade of — 
teachers this year than ever before; and, take it all in all, the ve 
outlook for the future is even more promising. vie 
MOORE COUNTY. 
  J. E. M. Enocus, Supnrintenpent, Lynchburg. 
In submitting this, my second annual report of the schools of 
Moore County, I am pleased to state that our schools, both 
public and private, have made an increase in enrollment and — 
average daily attendance; also the directors and teachers have _ 
been more punctual in making their reports. Their reports are — ! 
more reliable. I urged that they report strictly facts, and I be- 
lieve they are correct. This has enabled me to make a report — 
that can be relied on. 
  Our grade of teachers has improved. 
~ We need more money so that we can build better houses and _ 
have longer schools.

J. M. Topp, SUPERINTENDENT, Wartburg. 
In submitting my report for the years 1885-86, I much regret.

In regard to our schools I can report great improvement

a. ratifying change has been effected in the use of text- books. 
: Hitherto each pupil has followed the dictates of his own sweet 
ill in the use of text-books, and they have. been as many and — 
liversified as the colors of the famous coat worn by Joseph 
of old. With the assistance of the directors in the several dis- 
tricts, 1 have succeeded in securing the adoption of a uniform 
system of text-books, a result which I feel certain will con- . 
ribute largely to the efficiency and success of our schools.    
   
  - T would suggest that the County Court appoint Commission~ — 
ers to redistrict the county into sub-school districts entirely in- 
dependent of the civil districts; as, by this means, some of the 
smaller sub-districts might be consolidated, and the distance 
traveled by the pupils in going and coming from school would, 
in many cases, be actually lessened. 
Iwish to enter my solemn protest against directors making 
ew districts or tranferring pupils from one sub-district to an- 
other, unless it be done before the enumeration is taken. Other- 
wise endless trouble results, and it is almost impossible to get 
slre apportionment correctly and accurately allotted. 
In regard to our teachers, they are generally faithful, efficient, 
and progressive. Realizing that to them, for a time at least, is 
mmitted the care of immortal souls, and that the future suc- 
cess in life of the adult depends to a greater or less extent upon 
she teachings of the school-room, they have striven hard after 
the satisfaction that follows duty well done. 
_ Of course we have a few “moss-backs” in the outlying re- 
gions, but they are being fast eliminated, and the county is 
among the foremost plateau counties in educational advantages. 
Still we realize that while “Much has been done, but more re-

strictly correct, but as nearly so as I could make it with the — 
imperfect data at my command.

PERRY COUNTY. 
J. K. Hursrepurr, SuPERINTENDENT, Linden. 
  After considerable delay I submit my annual report. 
- Our schools have been working more harmoniously than ever 
before, and greater interest has been shown by all than at any 
time since I have had charge of the schools of Perry County. 
Our teachers and patrons are all talking and studying about 
the best methods of teaching, which says to me that they are 
about to wake up and support good schools. 
  Our schools have been too short this year. Scarcity of money pe 
was the cause, and the patrons are wanting longer schools next 
year. 
PICKETT COUNTY. 
M. C. Stpwett, SupERINTENDENT, Byrdstown. 
I submit to you my report for the year ending June 30th, 1886. 
Our schools have done well this year. They have been har- 
monious—uot a discord, to my knowledge, in the county. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-165
(165 ) 
    people of this county are realizing at last that the free school 
system of Tennessee is no longer a farce but a great blessing to 
_ the rising generation; and they say, as many have said, that 
_ Tennessee loves her children. 
_ We have held three institutes this year, which were well at- 
tended by the people and our teachers also; and permit me to 
say in behalf of our lady teachers that they attended the insti- 
tutes and worked bravely for the cause of education. They are 
1 to-day the best educators in the county; and though they are 
young in years, they have lived to gladden and bless the people 
of this county, and I mention this from the fact I would feel 
like I had acted unthankfully to make this report and fail to 
compliment them for their useful services in the field of educa- 
tion. 
I think that the next General Assembly of Tennessee should 
so change the school law as to prescribe certain qualifications 
for School Commissioners, and that none be eligible to said 
_ office who cannot read and write. I think that the old law re- 
quiring County Superintendents to approve all school warrants 
should be re-enacted. 
We now have a good school in Byrdstown conducted by 
Prof. John A. Capps. He is doing a good work for this county. 
POLK COUNTY. 
A. H. Mattock, Superintenpent, Benton. 
The schools have been tolerably full, and well attended; one. 
marked feature is, the citizens are becoming more interested in 
the subject of education, and attest it by visiting the schools. 
We have not yet been able to enlist all our teachers in the 
Thstitute, but, from all indications, there is a better day for us 
in the future; we need a uniform series of text-books,and more _ 
money to prolong our schools.

Our schools have progressed finely, about eighty per cent of 
the scholastic population of the entire county was enrolled; 
about eighty-five per cent of the white population were in reg-_ 
ular daily attendance during the three months taught, and 
about ninety-five per cent of the colored, The average tim 
taught of colored schools was about 30 days. 
Give us a little more money; let our School Commissioners _ 
be elected every two years at the August election; takeaway 
the appointing power of the County Superintendent; let all the — 
taxes levied by the State for school purposes be paid into the: : 
State Treasury, and there prorated equally among the several 
counties of the State according to the scholastic population off 
the counties; then we will have a State system of public 
schools instead of a county system. 
RHEA COUNTY. 
Wasu Morean, SUPERINTENDENT, Dayton. 
The schools of our county have done well the past year; I 
think much better than they have done any previous year. 
This is attributable in part to the fact that we have held regular — 
monthly institutes for the past year, and in part to a general 
awakening on the subject of education. We have five schools 
‘in the county which run ten months. The free schools are 
taught in them. They are well supplied with good teachers, 
mostly graduates; besides which we have many very excellent 
teachers in the common schools. We have some, however, who — 
are still in the old ruts. It is hoped though that ae will either 
rub up, or throw up their commission. Our county is progress- 
ng and wants our teachers to catch the inspiration. i

B. F. Fyxe, Supertntenpent, Hubertsville. 
I have the pleasure of forwarding my second annual report, 
showing the condition of schools in Robertson County. JI am 
proud to say that the schools are in fine condition; especially 
so when they are taught by teachers who are deeply interested 
in their work, as nearly all our teachers are. Our teachers are 
doing all in their power to make the schools of this county 
first-class schools. Twenty of them hold a certificate for five 
years, and they obtained them at the close of a two days’ exam- 
ination, conducted by a board of examiners composed of the 
most experienced teachers in the county. I have held twelve 
Teachers’ Associations continuing one day each, and one Normal | 
school continuing twenty days, besides holding a meeting for 
the Teachers’ Reading Circle. 
The financial condition of our county is good, but the school 
fund is too small. Our schools average ninety days, which is 
too short, but should be at least one hundred and sixty days; 
and I hope the next Legislature will make the State levy higher, — 
and enable us to have longer schools. ,

cially, the districts begin the new year in better condition, but 
_ few of them being in debt. The teachers will compare favor- 
   ably with those of any county in the State, while the buildings Dy 
are equal to any in the State. I would recommend that the — 
following changes be made in the school law: 
     
-P-A-G-E-168
      ( 168 ) 
1. Make a property qualification necessary in the selection of —

2. Give school districts the privilege of levying a school tax 
necessary to run schools not less than eight months in each and 
every year. 
3. Make a poll-tax receipt necessary before the admission of 
children to school, to be paid by all parents, and shown by 
parents to directors. 
4, Give Quarterly Courts the power to form new districts 
upon petition of a majority of the property-holders within the 
bounds of the proposed new districts. 
5. Let the State prescribe a uniform system of text-books to 
be taught throughout the State. 
SCOUT COUNTY: 
J. H. Jurrers, Supermnrenpent, New River. 
Our school work has moved smoothly and quietly on, showing 
a gradual and healthy increase of enrollment and average at- 
tendance. One thing which I note with pleasure is the growing 
sentiment, or determination, on the part of the people to 
henceforth elect none but the very best men for directors. I 
visit all my schools and give them encouragement, and confer 
with the teachers and district directors in regard to the pro- 
motion of the school interest. 
Our teachers seem to be doing a very good work; but while 
we have some good teachers, there are also fogies in the school- , 
room, as well as other places. I notice in my visits to the — 
schools that those who take school journals, and read good _ 
: books on theory and practice, are teaching school, while those is 
who do not are only keeping school. 
We issued more first-class certificates in this year than any 
other previous year. Our enrollment was larger, and daily at- 
      
-P-A-G-E-169
      
  « 
  (169 ) 
tendance exceeded any former year. All our county lacks in 
being second to none in the State in educational interest is not 
haying her schools graded, which, I think, will be done in the 
future. JI feel that I should thank the teachers, pupils, school 
officers, and the citizens generally, in this public manner, for 
courtesies shown me while in the performance of my official 
duties. I can assure them that such kindness will never be for- 
gotten. :

Joun E. Deakins, SuPERINTENDENT, Dunlap. 
Inclosed you will find my annual report for the year 1886. 
The public schools of the county for the present year are under 
good headway, with prospects of great success. They are sup- 
plied with a better grade of teachers than in former years, and 
the only impediment to them is a want of funds to continue 
them. The educational interest of the county is much better 
than it has been, but not so great as it ought to be on so impor- 
tant a question.

ents of the State; but I am proud that I am able to speak of a 
‘slow and steady improvement upon the whole work.

  A 
Our county is one of the counties “of the State which has 
never been redistricted, consequently we meet with disadvant- 
ages from this consideration. In some districts three directors — 
have charge of as many as eight schools, and consequently they 
often have separate plans they would like to carry out. One 
most detrimental to the schools is to “Put my relative into a 
position at your end of the district and your relative into a po- 
  sition at my end of the district, and keep the money in the fam-— is 
    ily.” I much prefer a redistricting, and the placing of three — 
commissioners over one school, and no more. 
We have never yet been able to adopt a graded system in our 
county. This I think would be of great value to our schools 
at present. Probably a failure in this respect is due to the fact _ 
that we have scarcely enough money to conduct our schools 
four months in the year. 
Our advancements are confined, in part, to better qualified i 
teachers, better school-heuses, a more uniform system of school- 
books, and a greater interest manifested in the work. - 
I invite the attention of persons to my statistical report in 
  consideration of our schools, and in comparison for four years 
decide for yourselves what progress we have made.

The State Normal held at Collierville was well attended, and —

soon, as the work is going on “slowly but surely.” :

in nearly every district in the county, and are building every

Since my last annual report the schools of this county have — 
been, in ‘some respects, much improved. The county has 
adopted a uniform series of text-books, with which many of 
the schools have already become uniform, and others are now 
making exchanges. The County Normal, held in July, was 
well attended by the teachers of the county, and all seemed to _ 
be well satisfied with the results. Instructions were given by 
an able corps of teachers, who are now at work in the schools. 
of the county. The teachers are laboring to improve them- 
selves, and a much better work is expected this year than in 
any preceding year. 
The schools have opened fuller than usual. Improvements 
have been made in the way of buildings; one building has 
been erected at a cost of $3,500. The directors are giving 
more attention to their schools than’ formerly. The first 
Teachers’ Institute for this year will be held November 12th 
and 18th. The attendance at past institutes has been good, s 
especially have the citizens given much encouragement in lo- _ 
calities where institutes have been held. ;

TIPTON COUNTY. 
  P. A. Fisuer, SuPERINTENDENT, Covington. 
  I have delayed making my report of schools, to the present 
time, hoping to obtain all necessary statistics from directors, 
teachers, and trustees in order that I might say for once my 
report is absolutely correct, but I must say that I have only 
partially succeeded. This difficulty would be obviated if district % 
clerks were properly remunerated, and then required to do their 
duty. Notwithstanding the difficulties under which we have 
labored, I think I can safely say that we have made some 
progress the past year. 
      Our public examinations held semi-annually, in January and 
July, have produced excellent results. It is a ditticult matter 
_ for an incompetent teacher to obtain a certificate under this 
f plan. We have institute work in connection with our exami- 
nations. Prof. Geo. Holmes, Capt. Jas. I. Hall, and Rev. Mr. 
Medows render invaluable aid on such occasions. 
  We contemplate holding a County Normal Institute, of several 
weeks duration, for the special benefit of those who have never 
attended your State Institutes or Normal Schools. We hope 
our County Court will appropriate something for this purpose. 
I will state just here that this county sent a larger representa- 
tion to the Institute held at Collierville than any other except 
Shelby, the county in which it was held. 
The Tipton County Teachers’ Association, under the efficient 
management of Professor Holmes and Captain Hall, holds 
monthly meetings regularly, and it is hoped will accomplish 
much good in the future. 
  In conclusion I will say that the majority of our teachers are 
alive and progressive, and a greater interest is manifested on 
the part of the people in public schools than ever before; but 
we need funds sufficient to conduct them for eight or ten months _ 
in the year to bring them up to the proper standard.

‘Ithink the Legislature, when it meets, ought to amend the 
ool laws so as to force each county to levy a tax sufficient to 
tinue the schools five months each year. Also phy siology 
d hygiene ought to be added to the school course, so the ri 
x seneration may gain a knowledge of organized bodies and 
the laws of health.

   herewith send you my report for the scholastic year ending 
June 30th, 1886. I believe there has been no material change 
ade in our financial condition since my last year’s report. 
1e greatest drawback in VanBuren County is that we have 
0 little money to continue for a sufficient length of time.

the teachers of our county with renewed energy, and put them 
to work in good earnest to try to keep up with their profession. 
We hope, by untiring energy, to make our school interest a 
grand success. Success to you; hope you may be re-appointed

T have visited all the schools of my county one time, many of 
them twice. We are doing a much better work this year than 
last. We have several consolidated schools in this county, 
which are doing excellent work. Our County Institute meets 
once a month, which is attended by a goodly number of teach- 
ers, and by the people generally. We are not what we should 
be yet in point of education. We want to be more aroused on 
that particular subject.

I am glad to be able to verify my promise to you that I should 
have an accurate and encouraging report for you this year. 
The Summer Normal Institute succeeded beyond our most 
sanguine expectations. About 175 teachers were enrolled, of 
whom at least 100 were from our own county. The lessons 
taught for the last four years in these institutes are not forgot- 
ten. Our teachers read the literature of their profession. They _ 
_ buy the books and take the papers from everywhere. During 
the last year an educational paper has been started in ourown 
_ midst by Prof. J. B. Powell, of Linwood School, and it is one 
_ of the freshest, brightest, purest educational papers published.

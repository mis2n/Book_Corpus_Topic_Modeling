PREFACE 
The idea and purpose of this book is first to group material 
and outlines for history work in Primary and Rural Schools 
in a convenient form for the teacher’s use. For this reason, 
in cases where it would be difficult for the teacher to find 
the stories or facts, they have been given in such a form that 
the teacher can adapt them to her use. Also very full out- 
lines have been given in most cases, so that the arrangement 
in story form may be easier for the teacher. 
The plan has been to give sufficient work fora fourth grade 
or for use ina Rural School, and then it is expected that the 
first grade teacher will select the easier topics and points 
for her pupils. 
The second purpose is to give suggestions for making the 
history work more vivid and real to the pupils; to show how 
children may be made intensely interested in this subject in the 
lower grades; and how it may be connected with the homes 
and lives of the children. For this reason there are many 
suggestions for the use of action on the part of the pupils 
in the regular school work. In connection with each month 
there are also suggestions for tableaux and simple enter- 
tainments or exercises, which may be given by the pupils 
before their parents and friends; or may be used partly in 
still simpler form in regular school work. It has been the 
intention that each exercise and entertainment should have 
a meaning, be connected with the story work of the month, 
and teach something, as well as be of interest. 
Of course the teacher would make selections from these 
suggestions and would use only a few of them in any one year. 
In the third place this book places emphasis on the value 
of the old celebrations of festivals. It suggests adaptations 
of these festivals and pageant ideas to present conditions. 
The joyfulness, the childlike simplicity of these ancient 
festivals is worthy of preservation. These festivals brought 
5

the people of a community together and taught them co- 
operation and valuable civic virtues. The revival of some 
of these old-time celebrations or the better use of our Ameri- 
can holidays may do the same for our country towns. In 
the cities the adaptations of historic ideas in the celebrations 
may help greatly in bringing the foreign element into touch 
with conditions in the United States. 
While this material is planned especially for Primary Grades, 
it may be used for general lessons in Rural Schools. There 
is also much in the suggestions for holiday celebration which 
is suited for upper grades and also for use outside of school. 
Practically all the suggestions given in regard to regular 
school-room work have been tried in connection with the work 
in history at the State Normal School, Fitchburg, Mass. 
Thus this is the result of the method of teaching history to 
children-at that institution. The dances, drills, and exer- 
cises have been easily taught to the children, and they have 
been greatly interested in this work. 
All illustrations are of children or Normal School pupils 
connected with the Fitchburg Normal School, and engaged 
in illustrating the character of this work. Many of the cos- 
tumes and other articles needed for the work described were 
made by the members of the class of 1914 and used by them, 
in connection with the telling of stories, etc., to children, 
during their first year at the Normal School as a part of 
their preparation for teaching. 
This work would have been impossible had it not been for 
the kind co-operation of the principal, supervisors, and teach- 
ers connected with the Fitchburg Normal School, and the 
interest and helpfulness of the pupils. Besides the class of 
1914, some of the members of the Advanced Class of 1913 
helped in giving the exercises which are described for October; 
a few members of other classes also helped in making articles 
needed and in training the children for some of the other 
exercises which have been given at the school. It is of 
course impossible to name all who have helped in this way. 
The name of Mary H. Arthur should be mentioned, however, 
because she planned the movements for the Harvest Drill 
and also for the Flag Drill; also that of Edith P. Ballard,
-P-A-G-E-8

as partly planning the statements to be given by the children 
in the exercise concerning the Harvest Festivals in other 
countries and the dialogue for the making of the first 
American Flag. 
Special thanks are due to Willis B. Anthony of the Fitch- 
burg Normal School for his interest and valuable help in 
obtaining illustrations for the book. 
Many of the songs suggested as appropriate for the differ- 
ent months and entertainments were selected from among 
those taught to pupils of the lower grades connected with 
the training department of the Fitchburg Normal School. 
Miss Elizabeth D. Perry, who has charge of the musical 
department at this Normal School, has kindly revised these 
lists of suggested songs.

INTRODUCTION 
DIscussioN OF THE PRINCIPLES OF STORY-TELLING AND 
Work In History FoR THE LOowER GRADES 
To train pupils to be valuable members of a community, 
to inculcate thoughts, feelings, and purposes, which will 
make for good citizenship is the work of the schools. While 
this is the general object of all work in the schools, story- 
telling and work in history tends directly to the accomplish- 
ment of this end. 
The lower grades have a distinct part in this training for 
good citizenship. Small children are more imaginative, 
more enthusiastic, more easily pleased and influenced than 
older pupils. Much can be done with them, if carefully 
attempted. No definite work in civics is suggested for the 
lower grades, but careful consideration of the influence 
of stories upon character-building, indirect teaching of the 
value of patriotism and the civic virtues, and the inculcation 
of admiration for the heroes of our country is really the teach- 
ing of civics. All work in this book has been chosen and 
planned with this object in mind. 
The methods which are chiefly used to influence small chil- 
dren in training them to be good citizens are story-telling, de- 
vices to arouse their interest, and simple celebrations of 
holidays. Realizing how much depends upon interest in 
this work, many things are considered history in the lower 
grades, which would not be generally classed under that head. 
The importance of good story-telling in the lower grades 
can hardly be overestimated. Even in regard to historical 
knowledge, a person who has not made the attempt is unable 
to realize how much little children can understand and re- 
member, if the facts are presented to them in the form of 
an interesting story. The children gain, however, in many 
other and still more important ways than in knowledge. 
The stories teach them to be sympathetic and broad-minded; 
9
-P-A-G-E-11
10 INTRODUCTION 
to appreciate differences of life and customs; and they instill 
admiration for what is true and noble. It is one of the great 
principles of teaching that this admiration and desire to emu- 
late others must come first in the development of character. 
The celebrations and stories teach to foreign and native- 
born children patriotism and the meaning of their country. 
The selection of appropriate stories to be told to children 
is very important. First of all, the interests of the children 
must be considered. A subject which cannot be made in- 
teresting to children should not be presented in lower 
grades. Whether the story is of interest to them or not, 
however, depends toa great extent upon the way in which 
it is told. Next, stories should never be chosen unless they 
will be of some permanent value along the lines already 
mentioned of preparing the children for their future life 
as citizens of our country. The third point to be con- 
sidered is the historical or literary value of the story. 
Before telling the story, the facts must be clearly and 
definitely in the teacher’s mind, so that there will be no hesi- 
tation when talking to the children. Then the story-teller 
can give her attention to her audience and the effect of the 
story upon them. The important points of the story itself 
should be carefully chosen, arranged in the right order, 
and adapted to the age of the children. 
The principles of good story-telling are the same as for a 
good orator or public speaker. Anyone who is speaking must 
first of all obtain the attention of his audience. In telling 
a story, therefore, the teacher must introduce the story in an 
interesting manner;,she must begin by appealing in some way 
to the interests of the children of her grade, she must con- 
nect the new which she is about to tell them with something 
with which they are already familiar, and arouse their curi- 
osity in regard to the story. There must be variety in the 
methods of introducing stories. What will do for one story 
or one group of children will not do in other cases. In general, 
we may say that the method of introducing the story should 
be suited to the subject, the audience, and the story-teller. 
A good story-teller is interested in her subject, of course, 
and in her audience. Enthusiasm, sympathy with the
-P-A-G-E-12
INTRODUCTION i 
characters in the story and with the children is shown in 
manner, voice, and expression. The voice and expression 
change for different parts of the story. She talks with the 
children and takes their point of view. 
To be able to see the dramatic points in a story is another 
one of the chief elements in effective story-telling. Having 
selected the dramatic points, the teacher must be able to 
present them by means of vivid descriptions and the use of 
comparison and contrast, in such a manner that the children 
will be able to see pictures of the various important scenes 
connected with the lives of the characters in the stories. 
The important points in each story must be emphasized 
in different ways. Change of tone is sometimes a very 
effective means of emphasis. In telling history stories, the 
teacher should seek also to bring clearly before the pupils 
the historical facts. 
Simple language should be used with small children, but 
words which are new to the children must be introduced in 
order to enlarge their historical vocabulary through this story 
work and thus better prepare them for the work in the higher 
grades. All new words and other points of difficulty should, 
however, be clearly and carefully explained. The story itself 
must be told clearly and definitely in order that the pupils 
may be able to remember and reproduce it. 
In telling stories to children all points, as far as possible, 
should be connected with their own lives and previous know]- 
edge. Toa great extent the use of comparison will bring out 
the resemblances and differences between the things the 
teacher is explaining and the children’s own experience. 
Tf the story-teller wishes the children to understand anything 
concerning time, distance, or size, this method of compari- 
son must always be used. 
It is always easy to tell whether children are interested in a 
story which is being told to them or not. If the teacher sees 
that they are not interested, she must be able to vary her 
method of presenting the subject. She must endeavor 
to arouse the children’s curiosity. Sometimes she may be 
able to do this by asking them to imagine what would happen 
next in the story. Sometimes a lower tone of voice, or a
-P-A-G-E-13
12 INTRODUCTION 
question about something in the story, or pausing a moment 
in the talk will effect the same result. By all means monot- 
ony must be avoided in telling the stories. 
The unity of the story should be considered. By this 
is meant that the teacher should have some special purpose 
in mind in telling that particular story, and then she should 
try to bring out, through the method of telling the story, 
the central thought which she wishes to enmphasize. 
In some stories or lessons the pupils may be able to reason 
out for themselves certain facts. They should be encouraged 
to do this whenever possible. Questions should be used 
sometimes, also, to develop the children’s imagination and 
to see if they understand the difficult parts of the story. 
The teacher should be perfectly natural in her manner of 
telling the stories. She should not copy anyone, but should 
know her own points of strength and make the most of them. 
A good story-teller needs no outside devices to hold the chil- 
dren’s attention, beyond the power of her own personality 
as shown in voice, expression, and dramatic description. 
The value of the kind of devices which are suggested in this 
book is either to make a stronger impression through the 
power of suggestion and proper atmosphere, or to add more 
life and action to the reproduction work after the story has 
been told. Of course good pictures and real historic articles 
are always of value. 
In conclusion, the teacher should review or sum up a few 
of the most important points of the story, or else in some cases 
she should lead up to a most interesting climax and leave 
all the review or summary until the next lesson. 
After the story or talk has been given to the children, they 
should be allowed to give expression in as many ways as 
possible to the new ideas and impressions which they have 
received. This will make the story more impressive, because 
of the greater interest which isaroused. In the first place the 
children should reproduce the stories in their own words. For 
this review many little devices should be used to add variety 
and interest. The ones given in this book are merely sugges- 
tive. Alive teacher will alwaysbe able to plan variations and 
think of methods best suited to the conditions of the school.
-P-A-G-E-14
INTRODUCTION 13 
The child should, also, be allowed to express his thought 
of the work through some form of action. This action in- 
cludes not only simple dramatic action, but also all other 
forms, as drills, dances, games, and tableaux. Through these 
the child may express his ideas in somewhat the same way 
in which primitive man and races in their early development 
expressed theirs. These methods of expression through 
action are natural to children; work of thiskind brings them 
into closer touch with the characters in the story or with 
the subject they are studying, makes them more sympathetic, 
and develops the imagination. For this reason many exer- 
cises and different forms of action have been suggested in 
this book. This should be the child’s expression of his emo- 
tions in action; it should be simple, spontaneous, and full 
of joy. Even for exercises which are to be given before 
parents or others, there should be no more rehearsing than 
is absolutely necessary and the rehearsing should be taken 
in such a way that it is play and self-expression.on the part of 
the child. If this manner of expression is used in the school- 
room in connection with the regular work, and the children 
become accustomed to it, when the teacher wishes special 
exercises, she will find very little rehearsing necessary. She 
will, also, find that the children enjoy both rehearsing and 
giving the exercises. ‘The drills, dances, etc., demand action 
together and physical self-control and through them the 
pupils gain important beginnings in the training for good 
citizenship, because good citizenship depends upon com- 
munity action, obedience, and self-control. 
The central thought of all history is unity and progress. 
We.would allow the children to celebrate in simple form the 
ancient festivals, as well as our present holidays. We would 
explain to them how long ago the people used to celebrate 
these festivals, some of which are still celebrated. Tell them 
how people expressed their joy through these ancient festivals, 
show them, if possible, a better method of expression to-day, 
and so gradually and unconsciously teach them to see the 
underlying unity of all peoples, the good in all, and prepare 
them in their later study to realize the advancement through 
the ages of the human race.

the Postoffice Department called on Lincoln in 
Springfield, and asked for seventeen dollars which 
belonged to the Government, from the office where 
he had been postmaster. Lincoln hesitated an 
instant and a friend who was with him offered to 
lend him the money. From a small trunk in a

the agent was gone, Lincoln said to his friend, ‘I 
never use any man’s money but my own.”

SUGGESTIONS FOR MAKING THE WorK ABOUT ABRAHAM LINCOLN 
More INTERESTING 
Decorations 
Patriotic decorations should be used in the school-room 
during this month. The flag, or the red, white, and blue crépe 
paper will help to make the room attractive and also to give 
this patriotic touch. By using this paper, with thin cardboard 
for a background, shields may be made; and the paper may also 
be arranged about the blackboard. The pictures of Washing- 
ton and Lincoln should be displayed prominently in the room 
during the whole month. Under the pictures, upon a white 
background, the following motto may be shown: ‘““They made 
and preserved us a nation.” 
Emphasizing the important points of the story 
A good way to impress upon the children’s minds certain 
points in the story and to arouse interest is to allow them to 
wear white shields upon which, in red letters, are placed some 
names that have reference to Lincoln. The shields are simply 
cut from white crépe paper; a blue border may be placed around 
them, if desired. The teacher might draw the letters, then let 
the children cut them out and paste them on the shields. 
The following names may be used to describe Abraham 
Lincoln: 
1 Poor Boy. 
In telling the story of Lincoln’s life, the first point to be 
emphasized is Lincoln as a poor boy and getting his own educa- 
tion under great difficulties. 
2 “Rail-splitter.” 
One of the names by which Abraham Lincoln is known. 
Explain to the children the meaning and reason for this name. 
3 Story-teller. 
Tell the children how Lincoln loved to tell stories and how 
his companions enjoyed hearing him. Where he lived;~when 
he was young, there were few amusements and Lincoln became 
popular, because he was such a good story-teller. 
4 “Honest Abe.” 
Illustrate this title by means of the stories already referred 
to in the outline.
-P-A-G-E-25
184 HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
5 Lawyer. 
Stories are also used to illustrate Lincoln’s characteristics 
as a lawyer. Emphasize especially the point given in the out- 
ae concerning his refusal to defend men if he thought they were 
guilty. 
6 President. 
Explain how important it was to have the right man for 
president at this time; the difficulties before Lincoln; and how 
Lincoln was especially adapted for the position. 
These shields may be worn by some of the children while 
the teacher is telling the story of Lincoln’s life, or they may be 
used for review work. Other points in the work about Lincoln 
may be emphasized or reviewed in the same manner as, for 
example, Lincoln’s characteristics: Industry, kindness, bravery, 
honesty, love for country, etc. 
Acting Stories Connected with the Life of Abraham Lincoln 
1 Return to the cabin after the work of the day. 
Let the children arrange the cabin in one corner of the room 
a3 well as they can with the few things at their command. 
Perhaps they can bring in a few boughs or some leaves for the 
bed; an old box or two or a stool might be used if they can 
be obtained. 
One of the girls, representing Lincoln’s stepmother, is 
busied about the cabin. Two boys enter; they may carry 
rakes or some farm tools (pretended tools will answer) to show 
that they have been working in the fields. One of the boys, 
representing Abraham Lincoln, goes over to one side of the 
cabin, gets something to represent a piece of corn-bread; then 
takes a small old-looking book; sits down upon the floor, putting 
his legs up on a stool or box, and goes to reading. The mother 
says to the other boy: ‘Now, John, you go and do the chores 
and don’t disturb Abraham. Let him study.” 
2 Story of earning the book, a “ Life of Washington.” 
Two boys are needed, one representing the farmer from 
whom the book was borrowed, the other Abraham Lincoln. 
The farmer may wear overalls and an old straw hat, if desired; 
some boy would probably be glad to bring these articles to 
school. Abraham Lincoln’s home is in one part of the room, the 
farmer’s in another. Abraham is reading a book; after a mo- 
ment or two, he closes the book, places it between something 
to represent the logs, and goes to sleep. The next morning he
-P-A-G-E-26
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 185 
wakes up, finds the book spoiled; and goes to the home of the 
owner. The farmer is pretending to be working in his garden. 
Abraham comes up to him carrying the book (a small old book 
should be used). 
Abraham Good-morning. I am very sorry Mr. Fel 
have spoiled your book. I put it in a crack between the logs in 
my room last night, and it rained during the night and wet 
it. .If you will tell me how much the book is worth, I will 
work for you until I have paid for it. 
Farmer Well, I think you may have the book if you will 
work for me three days to pay for it. 
Abraham Thank you, I shall be very glad to do that.   
3 Scene showing Lincoln’s love of reading and desire to obtain 
books. 
One or two chairs are placed near a table or the desk. 
Some books are arranged on the table or near it; if there is a 
bookcase in the room, of course the scene would take place near 
that. A boy is seated at the table. Another boy, representing 
Abraham, enters. 
Abraham May I borrow a book, please, sir? 
Boy at the table Why, certainly, you may take as many as 
you please; but have you read those I loaned you the other day? 
Abraham Yes, sir. Here they are. (Handing him some 
books or putting them on the table.) I have read them all and am 
much obliged to you. 
4 Tllinois State Convention, in which rails figure. 
(Explain to the children, if this scene is used, the meaning 
of delegates, that these delegates were to go to Chicago to vote 
for some candidate for president, that the men in this conven- 
tion were deciding which person they wished the delegates to 
vote for, and also the meaning of pioneer.) 
Boys seated on either side, one of the boys in the center 
behind a table, presiding. One of the boys is standing, with 
his arm extended, as if excited; this boy says: 
“T move that our delegates be instructed (or ordered) to 
vote for Chase!” 
Another boy jumps up quickly and says: 
: wr move that the delegates be instructed to vote for Lin- 
coln. 
Just then two boys enter, carrying rails (long sticks) across 
their shoulders. One of them says: 
“The rails made by Abraham Lincoln as a pioneer!’ 
(Great applause from the members of the convention.)

5 Abraham Lincoln as a storekeeper. 
Only a few extra things are needed to make this scene quite 
realistic, but it may be played with just the articles found in the 
school-room. A long, low table, such as is often found in schools 
to-day, or two boxes with a board between them will serve for the 
counter. If one or two small barrels can be obtained, they will 
do for seats; and one or two boxes, or articles to suggest a 
store, may be placed in back. A small pair of scales or some- 
thing to represent them should be on the counter. Some tea, 
or something to be used for it, should also be provided. A boy 
stands behind the counter, and another boy is seated upon one 
of the barrels in front. A woman enters; she wears a bonnet, 
something like a sunbonnet, and carries a bag. The bonnet 
can be made from construction and crépe paper. The woman 
comes up to the counter and says:   
Mrs. Good-morning, Mr. Lincoln. I should like 
— pounds of tea to-day. 
Lincoln Good-morning, Mrs. ——, I hope you are well. 
Mrs. —— Yes, I am very well, I thank you. 
(Lincoln weighs out the tea and gives it to her. She goes away.) 
Lincoln (looking in the scales, exclaims) Why,1I have made 
amistake! I didn’t give Mrs. —— enough tea into three ounces. 
I must close the shop and take it to her at once. 
Other Boy (lazily) Why don’t you wait until it is time 
to close shop, or until she comes in again, and then you can tell 
her? I wouldn’t go ’way off there for three ounces of tea; it’s 
a long walk. 
Lincoln It doesn’t make any difference how much or how 
little it is; it belongs to her and she ought to have it. (He closes 
the shop and starts off.) 
(Another part of the school-room — the home of Mrs. ——. 
(Lincoln knocks on the side of the room; Mrs. comes.) 
Mrs. Why, Mr. Lincoln! What brings you here at 
this time of day? 
Lincoln I made a mistake in weighing that tea for you 
and didn’t give you enough into three ounces. Here is the 
rest. (Handing a very small package to her.) 
Mrs. Thank you, Mr. Lincoln; but you need not 
have come ’way out here with it. 
Lincoln It belonged to you and so I had to bring it. 
Good day. (Lincoln goes away.)

I Life in Virginia in the Time of Washington 
1 Description of plantations. 
a Each like a small village; the owner’s house in the middle 
surrounded by outbuildings and negro cabins; the 
pastures, meadows, and fields of tobacco stretching 
away on all sides. Several miles between these plan- 
tations, so that it was difficult to see much of one’s 
neighbors. 
b Difference in the houses of the planters; general plan 
of the houses — exterior, interior, furniture, most 
important rooms. 
c Nocities or large towns and, in general, but one occupation. 
2 Population. 
a Classes: Slaves, white servants (indentured servants), 
middle class (small farmers), clergy and great planters. 
6 People lived mostly at the water’s edge or near the mouths 
of the rivers; behind the mountains was a wilderness, 
peopled by wild animals and Indians.
-P-A-G-E-31
199 HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
3 Trade 
The trade was with the Mother Country. English 
tobacco ships came up the rivers, took the tobacco 
from the plantations, and wherever they went left 
the goods and told the news which they had brought 
from England. 
4 Means of travel. 
On foot or horseback, or by boats on the rivers. Most 
of the roads were little better than woodland paths; a 
rich man could make his way with six horses over some 
of them. but the best means of travel was by boats. 
5 Great hospitality of the people. 
6 Life of the planters. 
a Care of the family for the women and of the plantation 
for the men (riding over the plantation). 
b Horse-racing, hunting and fishing for leisure time. 
7 Education. 
a Few schools. 
b Eldest sons of the rich planters sometimes sent to England 
to be educated; sometimes the ministers taught 
pupils. 
II Washington’s Family, or Ancestors 
1 In England. 
a In the North of England is the little village of Washing- 
ton, which once belonged to Sir William de Hertburn. 
He or his descendants took the name of De Wessyng- 
ton. In other parts of England there were many 
descendants of this family. 
6 One of these, Lawrence Washington, was Mayor of 
Northampton and was given by the King the manor of 
Sulgrave in 1538. It is from this family that George 
Washington is supposed to be descended. 
c The Washingtons of whom we hear in England were 
generally bold men, of some importance, though not 
gaining the highest honors, ready to fight and gener- 
ally successful. 
d The manor of Sulgrave, the home of Washington’s an- 
cestors, may still be seen, although it does not belong 
to Washington’s family. It is greatly changed, but 
the old oak-staircase and dining room with its great 
fireplace still remain. The motto of the Washington 
family may be seen inside of the building. (Proposal 
of England in regard to this manor as part of cele-
-P-A-G-E-32
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 191 
bration in 1914 of one hundred years of peace between 
United States and England.) 
e Inthe churches near here some of the Washington family 
are buried and the Washington coat-of-arms is placed 
at their graves. 
jf The Washington coat-of-arms. The shield is white, 
crossed horizontally by two red and white bars; above 
these are three stars of red. For the crest there is a 
raven issuing from a gold ducal coronet. (Explain 
meaning of coat-of-arms.) It has been suggested 
that the Washington arms gave the idea of the Ameri- 
can Flag, but it is hardly likely. Coats-of-arms have 
mottoes, and the motto adopted by the Washington 
family is from the Latin Poet Ovid: “Exitus acta 
probat,” “Actions are tested by their results.” (St. 
Nicholas, Vol. X1, November, 1883, p. 66, has an article 
on this subject.) 
2 In 1658, two brothers, John and Lawrence Washington, 
came to Virginia and purchased lands. George Wash- 
ington was great-grandson of this John Washington. 
III Birth and Early Life of Washington 
1 Father, Augustine Washington. 
a A farmer and planter. 
6 Married twice, and had three sons and a daughter by the 
first wife; four sons and two daughters by the second. 
c We know nothing of Washington’s father, except that 
he was kind and fond of his wife and children. He died 
when George was about eleven years old. 
2 George Washington’s birth and home. 
a Oldest child of the father’s second marriage; born on 
February 22, 1732, at Bridges Creek, Virginia. 
6 House in which he was born: A plain wooden farmhouse, 
of old Virginian type; four rooms on the first floor, 
an attic with long, sloping roof, and a great brick 
chimney. 
c Three years later this house is said to have been burned 
and the family moved to another estate where George 
Washington spent his boyhood. The house here was 
of the same general type as the first. 
(Show pictures of old Virginia farmhouses.) 
3 Washington’s mother. 
a Although she lived to be old, we know very little in 
regard to her.
-P-A-G-E-33
192 HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
6 A widow at an early age, with a family of children to 
educate. (Not much money, but a good deal of 
land.) 
c A woman of business ability, strong character and will 
power, dignified, silent but loving, had little education 
and read but few books. 
d Had a marked influence over Washington’s life, of whom 
she once said, ‘‘ George had been a good boy and she was 
sure that he would do his duty.” 
Washington’s education. 
a Placed under the charge of a man named Hobby to 
learn the alphabet; Hobby was sexton of the parish. 
6 Then sent back to Bridges Creek to live with his half- 
brother, Augustine, and to attend a school kept in that 
place by one Williams. There he received a common 
school education. 
c He studied faithfully; was a leader among his school- 
mates, because he could walk or run faster than any 
of them, and was also stronger than any of them. 
Discussion in regard to going to sea. 
a A large, strong boy of fourteen; his mother, who had but 
little money and five children, wished to put him where 
he could earn his own living. 
6 Plan to send George to sea on a tobacco ship; reluctance 
of mother and final decision against the plan. 
Washington in school for two years longer. 
a Fitted himself to be a surveyor. 
6 School exercises of this time. 
(The exercises show beautiful writing and neatness. 
His rules of behavior are, also, carefully written.) 
They show that he was a thoughtful boy. Self-con- 
trol is the chief point in these rules; few boys ever 
needed to consider this more, and no man was more 
self-controlled than Washington.)

Sr. VALENTINE’s Day, FEBRUARY 14 
As with many other festivals, which are still celebrated, that of 
St. Valentine’s Day is a very, very old custom. Long, long ago 
people wished, the same as they do to-day, to give pretty gifts 
to those they loved best. So as soon as the earliest tiny flowers 
showed themselves above the snow, they would gather them and 
take them to their friends, or else hang them on the altars of the 
gods they worshiped. 
The givers of these flowers did not put their names on them, but 
they put something so that the person who received them might 
be able to guess from whom they came. Sometimes a lock of the 
giver’s hair would be found if you looked carefully among the 
leaves of the flowers, or perhaps a little piece of a dress belonging 
to some friend of yours, and so you could tell, if you had lived in 
these olden times, from whom the gift came. 
When people began to live closer together in cities, they could 
not get as many flowers to give their friends. So they began to 
think what they could use instead of flowers. Then the girls 
embroidered gifts for St. Valentine’s Day and the boys used the 
pretty feathers of birds. The people in those days lived in great 
castles and the children were not allowed to go away from the 
castles during the:-long winter time, so they were very glad when
-P-A-G-E-37

HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 197 
the first warm day came and they could go out riding again. They 
celebrated the day by having a festival and their fathers and 
mothers gave them valentines. A girl would be given a hair 
ribbon and a boy a knot of ribbon to place on his sword. 
In some places flowers are still used for Valentine’s Day. Flow- 
ers are sometimes thrown over the garden wall in countries far 
across the ocean. In the southern part of our own country long 
ago the children used to hang baskets filled with flowers on the 
door-knobs for their friends. It is said that paper valentines 
were first made in Germany quite a long time ago. 
If we keep St. Valentine’s Day according to its old meaning, 
we will try to give pleasure to our friends by some simple pretty 
gift, as a little valentine we have made, or a few flowers.

red crépe paper upon which red hearts are pasted. She carries 
a gilded bow and arrow.

For scenery have a fireplace if possible; artificial ones may 
be made without a great deal of work. A few pots and kettles 
should be hanging about the fireplace. There is no furniture 
in the cabin, except the very rudest which suggests great 
poverty: a stool, or old-fashioned chair, boxes, a rude couch 
or bed, a fur rug may be used. A gun and powder horn should 
be hanging on the wall or placed in a corner of the cabin. A

cannot be obtained.

Lincoln should be a very small boy; and the part of Lincoln’s 
mother should be assumed by one of the older taller girls, 
dressed in an old-fashioned full skirt of cheap material.

two hands outstretched in characteristic story-telling style. 
This boy tells two or three of Lincoln’s best stories. 
3 The ‘Rail-splitter.” 
Either a boy carrying over his shoulder a large rail or log; 
or else a rail or log on the stage, and a boy standing, with an 
axe poised over his shoulder, as if about to chop it. 
4 Learning to be a lawyer. 
Either of the following tableaux might be given: 
a Lincoln seated on a pile of wood, reading a book of law. 
b Lincoln (a tall awkward boy) seated on a big box, with 
boxes, bags, barrels, etc., around him, reading the law book. 
5 The lawyer. 
Lincoln refusing to defend a man who is guilty. The boy 
representing Lincoln stands with his hand extended toward 
another boy in a gesture of refusal. The other boy looks at 
Lincoln in a supplicating manner. 
6 Lincoln addressing the people. 
A table or desk, covered with the flag or the flag paper, 
behind which the boy representing Lincoln stands; he is leaning 
over, with arm extended, as if speaking earnestly. A tall, 
black hat is on the table. Boys are standing in front listening. 
(Some of these tableaux may be used in regular school-room 
work also.)

II Articles Connected with Lincoln’s Life 
(By very small children: First or Second Grade.) 
Some articles connected with Lincoln’s life, as a small 
shovel, a small rail, a representation of a log cabin, etc., are 
brought to the front by these little children. Short statements 
concerning the articles shown are given. 
III We Vote for Lincoln, or the Name of Lincoln 
Seven boys take part in this exercise. Each boy carries 
paper folded in the form of an Australian ballot, only very large. 
On each ballot is placed one letter of the word Lincoln. A 
patriotic march is played and the boys march in a procession 
onto the stage. Each boy holds his ballot so that the letter 
is not seen at first; after he has given a statement as to the 
reason why he is going to vote for Lincoln, he turns\the ballot 
to show the letter on it. 
First boy Iam going to vote for Abraham Lincoln because 
he was born in a log cabin—L. ; 
Second boy I have a better reason. I vote for/ Lincoln 
because he was industrious when a boy and studied hard--J, 
Third boy I vote for Lincoln because he was noted for his. 
honesty —N. 
Fourth boy I vote for Lincoln because he understood and 
loved the common people —C. 
Fifth boy I vote for Lincoln because he was ifn tovall his 
obligations —O. 
Sixth boy Ithink the best reason for voting for Lincoln i: is 
because he was loyal to his country —L. 
Seventh boy The nobility Abraham Lincoln showed in all 
he did and said is the reason why I cast my vote for him —N. 
(Instead of this exercise, a Lincoln procession might be 
given, or a procession of the ‘‘Wide-awakes” of 1860. If the 
procession is used, banners should be carried with mottoes 
on them, as for example: ‘‘We are for Lincoln.” The “Wide- 
awakes” should wear capes and caps. The boys in the proces- 
sion might wear shields, made from light cardboard to resemble 
the United States shield.)

b Tableau: The Slave Market. 
A boy or a girl, made up as a negro, is on a small platform 
in the center of the stage. The expression and attitude of the 
slave denote great anxiety. The auctioneer stands near, with 
raised arm as if waiting for bids. Boys are at one side, look- 
ing and seemingly discussing the negro. One tall boy, a little 
apart from the others, stands with clenched fist and an expres- 
sion of anger or disgust on his face. 
2 Cotton Drill. 
Sixteen girls take part in the drill. They wear plaid ging- 
ham dresses, or else loose surplices made of unbleached cheese 
\ cloth, with bandanna handkerchiefs on their heads and about 
their necks. They carry baskets, something the shape of 
waste baskets, only smaller; these may be made from construc- 
tion paper.ot cardboard. The baskets are filled with cotton. 
Of course,these children are made up as negroes. A boy, wear- 
ing ovetalls and-an old broad-brimmed straw hat, and carrying 
a\long whip, represents the overseer. 
The overseer enters first and stands in the center of the 
stage, half ;way back. Then the girls march in and arrange 
themselves in*rows on either side of the overseer. When they 
enter, they hold the baskets in front of them. For the first 
of the drill, they repeat the following all together: 
“Qh, de cotton fields am white an’ de pickers is but few, 
Save me, Lord, from sinkin’ down; 
(Bend down and lower basket in front.) 
If your fingers isn’t nimble, sure you nebber will get troo, 
(Basket to left; pretend to pick cotton with right kand.) 
Save me, Lord, from sinkin’ down; 
(Bend and lower basket as before.) 
If your bags is very light, den de overseer’s lash, 
(Overseer cracks his whip and negroes shrink away.) 
Save me, Lord, from sinkin’ down; 
Tf you're laffin’ in de mornin,’ den at night your teef will 
gnash, 
Save me, Lord, from sinking’ down!” 
(Lower basket as before; then raise to position.) 
Negro Song: ‘No more auction block for me.” 
The overseer leaves the stage. The negroes give drill and 
dance expressing joy.

Form in lines, two by two, and dance about the stage, 
swinging baskets. 
Dance in couples down the center of the stage to the front, 
then bow to the audience, and dance from the stage. 
(Instead of using the quotation given above for the first 
part of the drill, the song, “Keep Me from Sinkin’ Down,” from 
Cabin and Plantation Songs, may be rendered.) 
Some of the scenes which were suggested to be acted in the 
school-room might be given in the entertainment also. 
WASHINGTON’S BIRTHDAY 
AN ENTERTAINMENT 
(First) 
WorkKING For LIBERTY 
The Arrival of the Guests of Honor: Washington and His Attend- 
ants 
A small boy and girl, representing George and Martha 
Washington, are drawn to the center of the stage by little chil- 
dren. A boy’s large wagon, decorated with red and white and 
with the Washington arms, or in some other appropriate man- 
ner, may be used for Washington’s carriage. By using pieces 
of wood for a foundation, canvas for the top and sides, and paint- 
ing the whole, it is possible to make the cart resemble, to a cer- 
tain extent, an old-fashioned coach. 
The children who are drawing the wagon are dressed in 
white, and wear shields made to resemble that of Washington. 
Light weight cardboard is used for the shields; the red stars 
and stripes across the shields are of red crépe paper. Red and 
white reins are used. In front of the children drawing the wagon 
are two taller children carrying a banner upon which is the whole 
Washington coat-of-arms: shield, crest, and motto. Beside 
or in front of the wagon, as the procession enters, is also dis- 
played a flag like the first flag adopted by Congress for the United 
States; this is borne by a little boy. The flag may be made

of sateen, with stars for it cut from white glazed paper. Red and 
white streamers and festoons are used. Two or three children 
may be made up to represent negroes, if desired, and accompany 
the carriage. 
When the procession reaches the center front of the stage, 
George and Martha Washington are helped to alight; they 
come forward, bow to the audience, and Washington says a few 
words of greeting. Next, the children who carry the banner 
with the Washington coat-of-arms on it step to the front of the 
stage, facing the audience, Some one then explains the mean- 
ing of the arms and the motto. After this the procession leaves 
the stage, or else a patriotic song is sung and the curtain lowered. 
IT Scenes in a Soldier’s Life 
1 “Marching to the war,” or “Arming a soldier for war.” 
March of boys representing minute men; or else a tableau, 
which shows a little girl, dressed as a woman, handing musket 
and powder horn to a little boy, who seems to be in great haste 
to depart. 
(Instead of this, the tableau, “A Soldier’s Farewell,” might 
be shown. In this tableau, a little boy in soldier costume is 
holding the hand of a little girl and bending toward her. The 
little girl is dressed in old-fashioned costume and has her hair 
done up high and powdered.) 
2 Soldiers in camp. 
There is a fire in the center of the stage, arranged with red 
lights. Boys dressed as soldiers are grouped about; some of 
them are cooking their supper over the camp fire, others seated 
in groups talking. A large tent or several small ones may be 
arranged at the back of the stage; some boy will probably have 
a tent which he will be glad to loan, or small tents may be made 
something like Indian tents, of poles fastened together at the top, 
only in this case they would be covered with canvas or white 
cloth. If the tents are not used, some piles of hay may be 
placed in back, as if the soldiers were going to use them for beds. 
Bundles rolled to suggest knapsacks, guns, or any other articles. 
suggestive of war that can be obtained should be used in this 
scene. Hats to suggest those of the Revolutionary period 
can be made of construction paper. Long coats of cambric 
or some cheap material may be made also, if desired. (With 
just a few changes the night scene in camp, with the soldiers 
sleeping, may be shown also. Only upper lights and the lights 
of the campfire are used for this scene. To give a pretty effect
-P-A-G-E-45
204 HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
trees may be arranged about the tent in the background. A 
soldier in Revolutionary costume, carrying powder horn and 
musket, marches silently across the stage. He stops, listens, 
and peers toward the wings of the stage two or three times as 
he crosses and re-crosses the stage. He brings his gun to atten- 
tion and listens very carefully just as the curtain goes down.) 
Song: ‘“Tenting on the old camp ground to-night.” 
3 Carrying help to the soldiers. 
The general arrangement of the stage is the same as for 
the preceding scene. Two or three soldiers are standing near 
the center of the stage; one of them has his hand extended toward 
a basket which a woman is holding out toward him. The 
basket is a large market one filled with vegetables, fruit, etc. 
The other soldiers have all paused in their work or conversation 
and are looking eagerly toward the woman, who seems to have 
just entered the camp. This woman wears, of course, an old- 
fashioned bonnet and dress. 
4 Nursing the sick and wounded. 
The camp scene, with the tent at one side. Two or three 
soldiers are lying on some straw or leaning up against piles of 
straw. A soldier or two may be at the entrance to the tent. 
Two or three little girls, dressed in nurses’ caps and aprons, 
are bending over the soldiers doing different things to help 
them; one may have bandages and be binding up a soldier’s 
wounds, another giving water or medicine to one of the-soldiers, 
and still another feeding or reading a letter to a soldier. (Coats 
and.clothing rolled up might be substituted for straw as pillows 
and beds for the wounded soldiers. If this scene is given to 
represent a later period, the nurses should wear the red cross 
band on their sleeves.) 
5 Waiting for news after the battle. 
The stage is arranged for a simple home scene. At the 
back or on one side of the stage should be placed a representa- 
tion of a window, with drapery curtains on either side. A little 
girl, wearing the costume of a woman of the Revolutionary 
period, is peering eagerly out through the window. 
6 “For him the war is over.” 
For this scene it would be well to have some trees as a 
background. A soldier lies, with his gun beside him, just as he 
has fallen dead.
-P-A-G-E-46
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION — 205 
7 The soldier’s return. 
There are two ways in which this might be represented. 
The first is to show boys, dressed the same as described for the 
April 19th exercises, marching across the stage. They carry 
the first flag adopted by the United States. Little girls in white 
stand on either side waving their handkerchiefs and cheering 
the soldiers. The soldiers march around the stage once or twice, 
and then stand in the center, while the girls sing a patriotic song. 
The second way to illustrate this subject is to show a home 
scene, with a woman seated near the center of the room, reading 
a letter. A boy, dressed as a soldier, is just entering from one 
of the wings or from behind screens to represent the door. This 
might be given as an outdoor scene, with the woman seated on a 
bench, and the soldier coming through a gate in a fence or hedge. 
In the tableau, if preferred, the woman may have just dis- 
covered that the soldier has returned and stand, with out- 
stretched arms, the letter fallen at her feet. 
III The Liberty Dance 
A liberty pole is erected in the center of the stage, and 
wound with red, white, and blue. Streamers of red, white, and 
blue hang from the top of the pole. Little children in red, white, 
and blue costumes give the dance. There must be either six, 
nine, or twelve of these children, each one representing one of 
the three colors. 
The dance is as follows: 
Children dance in, half from either wing. 
Dance around the pole, changing to the opposite side from 
that on which they entered. 
Form in groups of three, one child representing each color; 
the groups take hold of hands, dance around together three 
times, stop, turn and bow to the liberty pole. Repeat the dance 
three times around in the opposite direction. (If there are 
twelve in this dance, one group of three may be on either side 
of the pole, one in front and one in back.) 
Form a large circle and dance around the liberty pole. 
Form groups according to color, all of red going together, 
etc. If there are twelve in the dance, of course there will 
be four in each group. One group, the white, remains by the 
pole, the red goes to the right of the stage, and the blue to the 
left. Dance around in the small groups; then stop, face pole 
and bow to it. 
Dance back to places at the pole, so that the arrangement 
around the pole will be red, white, and blue; take hold of stream-
-P-A-G-E-47
206 HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
ers matching the color of their costumes, and dance about the 
pole, winding the colors as for a May-pole dance. 
The costumes may be made in the following simple manner: 
The children should all wear white dresses, with low necks 
and short sleeves if possible. Over these are worn surplices 
of crépe paper, either red, white, or blue. These surplices 
are made by taking a double piece of crépe paper the length of 
the child’s dress, and cutting it out where it is folded so that it 
will go over the head, forming a low neck. The pieces that 
come over the shoulders should be scalloped for short sleeves. 
The bottom of the skirt is scalloped also. At the waist these 
surplices may be plaited onto a piece of cotton cloth, and the 
children may wear sashes or bands around the waist of the same 
color as the costume. The children wear little scalloped caps 
of crépe paper, and if desired they may have sandals also of 
red, white, or blue to match their dresses. 
Patriotic Song: ‘“Liberty’s Banner” (Songs of the Year), 
or any other appropriate song may be used. 
(The children in the dance kneel by the Liberty Pole, 
forming a tableau, while the song is sung.) 
If the costumes of the soldiers and a few other arrange- 
ments are changed, the Scenes in a Soldier’s Life will be as ap- 
propriate for Lincoln’s Birthday or for Memorial Day as for 
Washington’s Birthday.

II The Young Man, Washington 
1 At work as a surveyor. (Tableau.) 
Washington and Lord Fairfax’s eldest son should be near: 
some surveying instruments, posed as if surveying, Near these 
characters may be some articles suggestive of camp life, as 
blankets and a camp fire. The characters in this scene should 
wear high boots and long coats. (Consult pictures.) 
2 Washington’s reception by the French commander at Fort 
Le Beeuf. 
The teacher should give a brief explanation before this 
scene. Characters: The French commander and his attend- 
ants; Washington, an interpreter, and some Indian guides. 
Washington is handing the French commander a letter 
from Governor Dinwiddie of Virginia. (See Parkman’s “ Mont- 
calm and Wolfe,” Vol. I, Chapter V.) The Indians and the 
attendants are in the background of the scene. Washington 
wears a long coat with a cape on it, high boots, etc. The 
French commander wears light trousers, a white vest, and rather 
dressy coat of the period. Both carry swords and wear wigs. 
The wig may be made as described before; it comes down in 
the back and is tied with a ribbon. 
III Washington and the Great Struggle for Liberty 
1 Washington in command of the Continental Army. 
Boys, wearing the hats made to represent those of the time 
of the Revolution, are drawn up in line toward one side of the 
stage. The boy representing Washington stands in the fore- 
ground, with drawn sword, facing the soldiers. Washington is 
dressed in the full costume of the period. (Description of 
dress in “Historic Pilgrimages in New England,” by Bacon, 
page 435. Pattern may be obtained from the Butterick Pub- 
lishing Company, New York.) If the teacher wishes, she may 
have the boys give a military drill after the tableau. 
2 The Winter at Valley Forge. 
A few soldiers, in old ragged clothes and with bandages 
about their feet, are huddled around a small fire in the center 
of the stage. Some cooking utensils are near. The soldiers 
act very cold; one or two wearing long coats with the collars 
turned up, may be pacing the stage. If the stage is small 
enough, a representation of snow may be placed over it; this 
should be all ready to spread down. (Take old sheets, sew them 
together, and cover with cotton, putting paste on the cotton

and over that sprinkling mica snow.) A tent might be shown 
in the background, with a flag raised over it. This scene may 
be given at night with a sentinel on duty if preferred. 
Washington might be represented on a platform, a little 
back, either gazing sadly down upon the scene or at prayer.

3 Scene between a Quaker and his wife. 
(They lived near Valley Forge.) 
(This story is given in Gordy’s “American Leaders and 
Heroes,” page 206.) 
‘The stage should be arranged to illustrate a very simple 
home scene. A little girl in Quaker costume is seated by a 
table sewing. A little boy, in gray suit and Quaker hat, comes 
hurrying in; he says earnestly: “George Washington will suc- 
ceed! George Washington will succeed! The Americans will 
secure their independence!” The little girl looks up and says: 
“What makes thee think so, Isaac?” The Quaker answers: 
“T have heard him pray, Hannah. When I was out in the 
woods to-day, near the camp, I heard an earnest voice. I went 
nearer and I saw Washington on his knees, his cheeks wet with 
tears, praying to God for help. The Lord will surely hear his 
prayer. He will, Hannah; thee may rest assured He will.” 
4 Surrender of Cornwallis announced by the Night Watchman 
in Philadelphia. 
Screens shut off the back of the stage. Across the front 
the Night Watchman slowly paces; he wears a long coat and 
Revolutionary hat, and carries a tall staff and a lantern. Sud- 
denly another boy comes running in from the wing, waving 
his hat; he rushes up to the watchman and tells him something. 
Then the watchman turns partly toward the screens and the

wings of the stage and announces: “Past three o’clock and 
Cornwallis is taken!” 
He walks across the stage and back, giving the announce- 
ment. After the announcement, other children may come rush- 
ing out from behind the screens, cheering and shouting. 
IV The First President of the United States 
1 Washington on his way to the inauguration: Reception at 
Trenton. 
An arch is erected on the stage. Two poles and a cross- 
piece of wood may be used; at the top is tacked a rounding piece 
of cardboard or stiff paper. The poles are put into cross-pieces 
of wood so that they will stand up. The top of the arch is 
covered with green paper, upon which are the words: “The 
defender of the mothers will be the protector of the daughters.” 
The letters for this motto are cut from white glazed paper and 
pasted on the green background. The poles are wound with 
evergreens and laurel or with green crépe paper. Washington 
stands just under the arch — of course he is represented by a 
small boy dressed in proper costume. A few little girls, dressed 
to suggest women of the period (the costumes may be more or 
less elaborate as desired), are standing near the arch on either 
side. Six still smaller girls, dressed in white, wearing wreaths 
of green or flowers, and carrying baskets of flowers, are nearer 
the front of the stage scattering flowers before Washington. 
The children render the following song: 
“Welcome, mighty chief, once more, 
Welcome to this grateful shore! 
Now no mercenary foe 
Aims at thee the fatal blow.” < 
“Virgins fair, 
(Sung by smaller girls) 
And matrons grave, 
(Sung by children dressed as women.) 
These thy conquering arm did save, 
Build for thee triumphal bowers.” 
(All sing these lines) 
“Strew, ye fair, his way with flowers,” 
(Those dressed as women sing this line.) 
Then the smallest children dance forward, and scatter the 
flowers, singing: 
“Strew your hero’s way with flowers.”
-P-A-G-E-53
212 HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
The arch may be more elaborately decorated, if desired; at 
the top of the poles, flags or other patriotic decorations may be 
arranged. There should be a sunflower at the very top of the 
arch. The letters might be painted blue or gold iristead of cut 
from white paper. 
A first scene may be given before the arrival of Washing- 
ton; in this scene the children are talking about the arch and 
explain the meaning of the decorations. 
In “Days and Deeds a Hundred Years Ago,” by Gertrude 
Stone and Grace Fickett is a story, “‘The Inauguration of Wash- 
ington,” which describes this reception at Trenton, and gives 
the meaning of the decorations, etc., from the children’s point of 
view. This story is good to use for dramatization in the regular 
school work also. 
2 Washington receiving as President. (A tableau.) 
Stage arranged to suggest a drawing-room in the time of 
Washington. A fireplace, with old-fashioned candle-sticks on 
the mantel, a few chairs and a table would be sufficient. George 
and Martha Washington are receiving. A guest has just 
entered, and is bowing to Washington. 
__ (This scene miy be omitted and the entertainment close 
with the previous one if preferred. ) 
Song: “Hail Columbia.” (Or some other patriotic song.)

ADDITIONAL SUGGESTIONS FOR CELEBRATION OF WASHINGTON’S 
BrirtHDAY 
A Tea-Party in Old Virginia 
The stage is arranged with as much old furniture as can be 
obtained. (See suggestions given before.) A long table occupies 
the center of the stage. Old-fashioned pictures should be arranged 
at the back of the stage; these may be cut out and frames made 
for them. A large fireplace at the back adds greatly to the im- 
pression. Old-fashioned candles should be on the table and used 
to light the room. Little boys and girls, in the costume of the 
time, come in; each girl is escorted by one of the boys, who leads 
her to a seat at the table and then takes the place beside her. 
Negroes are in attendance, and bring in the different courses. 
(This may be acted in pantomime.) There were long waits be- 
tween the courses in old Virginia and they were not all served at 
the table, so for some of the courses the children might leave the 
table and seat themselves about the room. Between each course 
there may be some form of entertainment for the guests, as songs 
by the negroes, old-fashioned dances, etc. (It is not difficult 
to arrange costumes which will resemble those of the period. A 
woman’s dress of flowered thin material made with a full skirt 
can be altered so that it will do for a child in the Fourth Grade and 
will give the proper impression. Some of the children may wear 
ao and caps; others have the hair done high and pow- 
ered. 
A Dance when Washington was Young 
The stage should be arranged as for the previous entertainment, 
except that there would be no large table; the room might be 
decorated, and there would be a negro seated on a little platform 
at the back playing on an old fiddle. Two of the children may 
receive the guests. The children dance the Virginia reel, the 
minuet, and other old Virginia dances. Between the dances, 
they move about the stage and seem to be conversing and choos- 
ing partners. The little boys may have swords made of wood, 
which they hold above the heads of the little girls, as they dance 
down the line. After the dances, the children in costume may 
serve light refreshments to the parents, if they have been invited.

MARCH 
We are banished from the trusting heart of childhood, 
We have vanished from the valley and the glen, 
And the daisied upland slopes, the ferny wildwood, 
All have lost the flitting forms of fairy men. 
Cold and empty are the couches in the flowers, 
Long deserted is the circle ’neath the moon. 
You have lost us; we have vanished from our places, 
We whose joyous lore was born of Spring and Youth. 
If you long to glimpse again our wistful faces, 
You must seek us in the land where Dream is Truth; 
Where the happy heart of childhood never ages, 
In the lovely Land of Once upon a Time.

III A Story about Ireland 
1 Introduction. 
You have heard about the country of England, across the 
sea, and stories about the people who came from that country 
long ago to settle in our own land. Now I am going to tell you 
something about an island not far from England, from which 
many, many people have come across the sea to live in our own 
country. 
2 Hints for the story. 
The country from which these people came is a very, very 
beautiful country, so beautiful that some persons who have 
been there, say that some places in it are more lovely than can 
be found anywhere else in the whole world. There are moun- 
tains and deep sheltered spots in which grow ferns and beauti- 
ful flowers; the grass is very dark green; mosses, arbutus, holly, 
and the twining ivy may be seen everywhere. There are lovely 
lakes also in this land. It almost seems as if the deep green 
and beautiful work of shading everywhere must have been done 
by cunning little fairies and elves. And I will tell you a secret 
— this is the country the fairies especially love. Every moun- 
tain side has its stories of fairies and heroes. 
Perhaps some of the people who live in this country will 
tell us stories of these fairies and also of some of the heroes who 
used to live there long ago. Some milkmaid may tell us that 
she has seen fairy cows by the lakes, but that they always dis- 
appeared when they heard her coming. Sometimes, in the 
country, when the people want to make butter, they put a 
little burning turf under the churn, so that the mischievous 
fairies will not steal the butter or spoil it in any way. There 
is one little fairy, who wears a green coat and scarlet cap. He 
is always working, hammering away at a tiny shoe; this fairy has 
a very valuable little purse. Many persons have tried to get this 
little purse away from him, because every time you. open it, you 
will surely find money in it; but no one has ever succeeded. 
If you go to one of these mountains, you may hear how 
long ago O’Sullivan, a very swift huntsman, went out early in the 
morning to hunt the deer. He sees, suddenly, a most magni- 
ficent animal, and his dogs chase it, swiftly; but though they 
follow all day, they cannot catch it. At night the huntsman 
is very tired and thirsty. As he blows on his horn to call the 
dogs back to him, he hears some one say, “O’Sullivan, turn 
back!” He sees Finn McCool, a great man of the country. 
“Why do you dare chase my stag?” says Finn. “Because it
-P-A-G-E-61
220 HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
is the finest that man ever saw,” answered O’Sullivan. This 
answer pleased the great hero and he said, “You are a brave 
man, and since you are thirsty, I will give you a drink.” So he 
dug his giant foot into the rock, and water came foaming out 
and down the mountainside in a beautiful waterfall which may 
be seen to this day. 
The name of this country I am telling you about is Ireland. 
It is also called the Green Isle and the Emerald Isle, as the jewel 
called the emerald is green in color, and the island is rich in the 
green coloring of its woods and foliage. Would you like to 
visit some interesting places and see some objects connected 
with the history of this country? After we have crossed the 
ocean in a big steamer, I think you will like to travel around 
some of the time in what is called a jaunting-car. A jaunting- 
car is a kind of carriage, drawn by a horse, but it has only two 
wheels; the driver sits in front and the passengers sit on either 
side, but the passengers face toward the side of the road instead 
of front. (Show picture.) 
As we are riding along through the little villages, we must 
notice the small cabins or huts that some of the people live in; 
they have roofs different from ours, thatched —that is, covered 
with straw or reeds. But I cannot tell you much about the 
people and their homes, because I have many other things to 
tell you. Besides the huts of the poor people, there are beauti- 
ful houses and gardens owned by the rich people, and there are 
wonderful old buildings that have been partly destroyed. 
Long, long ago in Ireland, the people were not Christians, 
but they had priests, called Druids, who taught them to wor- 
ship in the forests and that the oak trees and the mistletoe, 
which sometimes grew on them, were sacred. Then, as you 
have heard, St. Patrick came and preached the Christian religion 
to the people. 
Now let us go to the top of a hill in Ireland, called the Hill 
of Tara. It is not a steep hill, so it is easy for us to climb to 
the top, but you will wonder, perhaps, why I want you to visit 
this place. As we stand here we can look far off in every direc- 
tion and it is a very beautiful view that we look upon; but it 
is not because of the view that we have come. It is because here 
long, long ago, was the palace of Ireland’s early kings. Here 
laws were made, and every three years a great meeting of all the 
lesser kings and chiefs of the country was held; these chiefs 
came to pay homage to the king of all Ireland. Five roads 
started from this hill and went in different directions. Accord- 
ing to Irish writers, more than one hundred and forty kings
-P-A-G-E-62
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 221 
tuled from this place. A description of the king’s Banquet Hall 
says that it was more than seven hundred feet in length; had 
fourteen doors; and on each side were rows of seats and tables, 
with lamps and fires between them. A hundred guests often 
attended banquets here; the king and his chieftains sat at one 
end, below them, in order of rank, were the doctors, poets, 
priests, and minstrels of the court, and last of all, the servants. 
One of these kings is said to have been a handsome man, with 
flowing golden hair, who wore a crimson cloak, a shirt in which 
were woven gold threads, and a girdle sparkling with precious 
stones. On the Hill of Tara is a statue of St. Patrick. One 
Easter morning in the year 428 A. p., St. Patrick came here to the 
court to see the king, his chiefs, and the Druid priests, and to 
tell them about the Christian religion. St. Patrick and the 
other missionaries who were with him were dressed in white and 
carried crosses in their hands; the king was so much impressed 
that he said they might preach the new religion all over his 
kingdom. (Stoddard’s Lecture on Ireland.) 
As you have heard, St. Patrick was very successful in 
converting the Irish to the Christian religion. After him there 
was another great Irish missionary, named St. Columba. St. 
Columba was a relative of one of the kings of Ireland; his name 
means a Dove. He founded many churches and monasteries. 
During the last of his life he lived on an island near the coast of 
Scotland; from this place he would cross the water to Scotland 
in a small boat, which was like a basket made of willow twigs 
covered with skins; thus he taught the Christian religion to the 
people in Scotland also. Many other Irish missionaries were 
sent to different countries, after the Irish had been converted 
to the Christian religion. Famous schools were also established 
in Ireland, and people came from England and other countries 
to study there. 
This time that I have been telling you ar was long ago, 
in the golden time of the history of Ireland, when this country 
was greater than the other countries across the water, in learn- 
ing and religion; and churches and schools were found in all the 
valleys and on the hill-tops. But a very sad thing happened. 
From the north came fierce savage men and made war upon the 
country. These were the Danes, who worshiped Odin instead 
of Christ; year after year, they came in their ships and attacked 
the Irish, and plundered and seized what they could. Es- 
pecially, the Danes did all the damage they could to the churches. 
This warfare lasted for two hundred years, and when the Danes 
were finally driven away, great injury had been done to the
-P-A-G-E-63
222 HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
country, and many of the churches and other buildings were in 
ruins. Near churches, or the ruins of these churches, in many 
places, are found to-day Round Towers, and it is thought that 
they were built as places of refuge from the Danes. The walls 
of the towers are sometimes four feet in thickness. As the 
entrance to the tower is twelve or fourteen feet above the ground, 
the towers must have been entered by means of ladders, which 
were drawn up afterward, so that the enemy could not follow. 
It is probable, also, that a watch was kept from the belfry of 
these old towers and that the people were warned if the Danes 
were seen coming to attack them. 
As we travel over Ireland, we may see also many ancient 
crosses, which were made very carefully by the monks long ago. 
The arms of the cross are enclosed in a circle; each little detail 
and ornamentation on the cross shows the labor and love that 
were put into the work. 
If you look at the flag of Ireland, you will see a harp on it. 
Why do you suppose the Irish have this musical instrument on 
their flag? Iwill tell you. Long ago the Irish people were very 
fond of music, and they liked especially to play upon the harp. 
Men who were very skilful in playing on the harp went around 
playing in the great castles. These harpers did not play for 
money or simply to please the people, but they were connected 
with the Druid priests at first and were greatly feared and 
honored by everyone. After this early time, the bards, or 
harpers, as they traveled from place to place through the coun- 
try, began to sing the stories of the great deeds of the heroes of 
their race and thus they taught the people to love their country 
and to admire brave deeds. 
Now that we are visiting Ireland, we must spend a short 
time in her most important city of Dublin. We will go to a 
building where many objects connected with the past history 
of the country are kept. I am sure you will be interested in a 
bell that is kept here. This bell is made of bronze and iron; 
it is about twelve inches high, simple and crude, and looks as if 
it had been used a great deal; but it is of more value than many 
bells of gold. It was used by St. Patrick and is over four- 
teen hundred years old. St. Patrick’s bell has a beautiful case, 
decorated with gold and silver, which was made to cover 
and protect it; a special person used to have charge of the bell 
also. 
In order to show you how carefully these old Irish workmen 
did their work, you must look at a beautiful silver cup in this 
same building. This cup is beautifully decorated and is com-
-P-A-G-E-64
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 223 
posed of three hundred and fifty-four separate pieces; every 
part of it, whether it would be seen easily or not, is made with 
equal care. A peasant boy one day found this beautiful cup, 
when he was digging in a field. 
Ireland and England have now for a long time been united 
and they have the same king or queen to rule over them. For 
many, many years, Ireland resisted the rule of England and 
the people were forbidden to ‘‘wear the green” because it was 
thought to show opposition to England. However, one of 
England’s greatest rulers, Queen Victoria, helped to bring about 
better feeling between the two countries. Once she came to 
visit Ireland, and the first thing that she bought in that country 
was a bunch of shamrock; she also ordered that all the Irish 
soldiers in her army should wear the shamrock on St. Patrick’s 
Day. It is said that St. Patrick used the shamrock to explain 
something about the Christian religion to the people of Ireland 
and they have loved it ever since. 
(In connection with the story about Ireland, show pic- 
tures of the country and the different objects mentioned. 
The children may be told, also, about some of the great Irish 
writers, Irish warriors, etc. The story given here is for a 
Fourth or Fifth Grade.)

II Glimpses into Irish History 
1 A number of children give a few of the most interesting events 
in Irish history. 
2 Dress children to represent noted Irish characters and let them 
give interesting facts in regard to these noted men. 
(A picture of Brian Boru is given in ‘‘Penelope’s Experi- 
ences— Ireland,’’— by Kate Douglas Wiggin, page 39. A loose 
garment with a belt, a skull cap, wooden sword, brown cloth 
to resemble leather wound about the legs, would give enough 
to represent this character. Other noted persons are’ men- 
tioned in Stoddard’s Lecture on Ireland.) 
3 Small children, poorly dressed, with little shawls over their 
heads, may represent Irish peasant children. Some simple 
quotations from Irish writers, or about Ireland, may be given 
by these children. 
III Folk-lore or Legends of Ireland 
1 St. Patrick. 
A little boy represents St. Patrick. He is beating a large 
drum as he enters; after he reaches the center of the stage, he 
tells, as if he were St. Patrick, the story of how he drove the 
snakes from Ireland. 
2 The Blarney Stone. 
A short explanation of the Blarney stone can be given by one 
of the children or one of the following scenes will be interesting: 
A representation of the Blarney stone is arranged in the 
center of the platform. This is made by using gray cloth or 
sandpaper as a covering over pillows or anything which can be 
fixed in the required shape. For the tableau, have a boy in 
Irish dress, kissing the stone. 
Another scene which might be given is the following: 
A little boy and girl, coming from opposite sides of the stage, 
meet in the center. The little boy, taking off his cap, bows very 
low and says: “The top o’ the morning to you, Mistress 
and sure you grow handsomer each time I see you.” 
The girl tosses her head and replies: “Arrah now, you’ve 
kissed the Blarney stone the day,” or “How long is it since 
you kissed the Blarney stone?” 
It would be pretty to have the girl dressed according to the 
ancient Irish fashion, in a long green gown, with flowing sleeves,

and a tight green cap. She carries a green bag, made to match 
the dress. The gown is trimmed with narrow white ribbon. 
The boy would be dressed in a poor suit, like an Irish country 
boy. 
(Other legends, or characters, in stories or poems connected. 
with Ireland may be easily illustrated so as to be interesting.) 
IV Irish Fairy Lore 
The stage is arranged for an outdoor scene. There are 
trees or branches in the background and around the sides of the 
stage. Representations of rocks may be arranged by covering 
pillows with gray cambric. ‘There is a green mossy seat in the 
center of the stage; this is made in the same way as the rocks, 
only the sofa pillows are in this case covered with green cambric. 
Green branches and vines are placed about the seat; bushes 
and small trees are arranged also at the sides or near so that it 
will look like a natural seat in a retired place. Two large repre- 
sentations of flowers may be made, if desired, by taking card- 
board or boxes for the foundation and then using crépe paper, 
wired into shape, for the petals. These flowers are a little 
back of the green seat, on either side. An older girl, dressed 
in white, is leaning back on the mossy seat, asleep. 
As she lies sleeping there, little fairies peek out at her from 
the flowers. If the flowers are not used, the fairies peek at her 
from behind the branches or trees. Before the fairies are seen, 
music sounds and a fairy song is sung.

Reader.) : :

“The Leprehaun,” by Patrick W. Joyce. 
(A fairy song may be sung first, and one later by the fairies, 
if desired.) 
As the fairies are now satisfied that the girl is soundly 
sleeping, a fairy procession enters, led by the fairy king and 
queen, one with attendants advancing from the left wing, the 
other from the right. The fairy king and queen carry wands, 
with which they direct the others in the dance which follows. 
The fairies surround the sleeping girl and mark the “Fairy 
Ring” on the stage; the fairy fiddler or piper seats himself

in the center near the sleeper. The king stands just back on 
one side of the stage, and the queen on the other; or they stand 
in the flowers. 
Half of the fairies dance about the queen and half about 
the king. After they have danced two or three times around, 
they stop and bow low. This is repeated. Then the dancers 
change sides, dance and bow as before. After this the fairies 
on each side of the stage form in lines, and dance lightly to the 
front of the stage, waving their arms as they dance; at the 
front they bow first to the right and then to the left. After 
this they dance to the rear of the stage, then repeat the move- 
ment to the front. Next the two rows face each other, form a 
large circle and dance around the sleeping girl and the flowers. 
Other movements may be added, but as these are very small 
children, the movements must be simple. Suddenly the girl 
on the mossy seat begins to wake up. The music stops. The 
fairy dancers hasten away, and the fairies in the flowers 
disappear. The curtain falls. 
The little fairies are dressed in loose gowns, trimmed with 
silver tinsel; half of the fairies wear red gowns and half of them 
green. They have white gauze wings; these are made from 
tarlatan, wired into the right shape. Silver tinsel is also worn 
by the fairies about their heads. The king should have on a 
red or green cap with a feather in it, a red cape, and full green 
bloomers. His wand is wound with red and green. If a fiddle 
of the right size cannot be obtained, a representation of one 
may be made from wood or heavy cardboard. 
Other methods of illustrating this subject would be the 
following: An older girl, dressed in an old-fashioned Irish cos- 
tume of green and white, might be seated on the mossy seat 
in the center of the stage; some little children are grouped about 
her in the attitude of listening to a story. She may tell some 
of the Irish fairy legends or stories, as, for example, about “The 
Leprehaun’’; or she may simply pretend to be telling them a 
fairy story. These children in a group about the older girl 
may be dressed to represent fairies, thus making a tableau; 
or after the story other children, representing fairies, may enter 
and give a fairy dance. Instead of this, fairy scenes or tableaus 
might be given, which would illustrate the talk of the older 
girl. For example, the fairy elf might be seated near a bush or 
tree, working on a small shoe, with his fairy purse beside him. 
A boy enters, creeps up behind him, and tries to seize the purse. 
Just as he is about to grasp it, the fairy jumps up, snatches 
the purse and runs from the stage.

V Irish Minstrelsy 
An Irish band of singers marches from the rear to the stage, 
singing Irish songs. The children, representing the Irish 
minstrels, are dressed in white with shamrock wreaths on their 
heads; they carry green harps, upon which they pretend to play. 
The shamrock wreaths are made from Dennison’s crépe paper, 
which contains the Irish symbols. 
The framework for the harps may be made from wood or of 
cardboard; this framework for Irish harps is covered with 
green paper; the strings are of silver cord. 
Instead of having the children march upon the stage, a 
tableau may be given first, and then the songs. The musicians 
may be grouped in any pretty arrangement upon the stage. 
Have one of the taller girls, dressed in ancient Irish costume, 
seated at one side listening to the music. This ancient Irish 
costume has been described. The stage may be suggestive 
of an outdoor scene, as for the fairy dance, or Irish decorations 
may be used. The shamrock crépe paper will help in the decora- 
tions, if an indoor scene is desired.

To allow the children to give expression, in simple manner, as it 
used to be expressed long ago, to the natural joyfulness of 
springtime. s

I The Waking of Nature from Her Winter Sleep 
“Wintry winds are blowing, 
Trees are bare — ’tis snowing, 
Beneath the drifts the flowers are buried deep, 
But in their icy dwelling 
Little brooks are telling 
That winter is but springtime fast asleep.” 
1 Signs of Spring. 
a The children mention some of them. 
The birds and the first flowers. 
(Give quotations; bring some of the early flowers into 
the school-room. Use pictures also.) 
b The little seeds in the ground waiting to grow. 
2 Joy of people over coming of spring. 
a From very ancient times celebrations have been held to 
show rejoicing at spring time. 
6 Among people of Northern Germany and England there 
used to be a goddess of the Spring, who was worshiped, 
and to whom the month of April was dedicated. 
(The name Easter probably comes from the name of this 
goddess.) 
¢ Feasts still held in some places to celebrate return of Spring.

II The Easter Festival 
1 The Christian celebration that takes the place of the ancient 
festival in honor of spring. 
2 Meaning of Easter. 
a The word Easter is said to mean “rising.” 
(The Saxon goddess, Ostara or Eastre, represented the 
East and morning as well as spring.) 
b Easter means life, and therefore as emblems of Easter 
may be used anything containing life within itself. 
Flowers are appropriate, because there is life in the bud, 
which bursts forth into the beautiful flower. 
(All flowers, which come from bulbs, as lilies, tulips, 
jonquils, the narcissus, the crocus, etc., seem especially 
to illustrate this idea and some of them also are among 
the first to break through the winter sleep.) 
Eggs are used, because the little chicken is shut up in the 
egg. 
The Shutteriy is a type of life also, because it comes 
from the chrysalis. 
3 Appropriateness of the Easter festival coming in the spring. 
4 Easter at first a period of thanksgiving lasting eight days. 
(This was about the same length of time as the ancient 
spring festival among heathen people.) 
III Old Easter Superstitions and Customs 
1 Belief of some people that the sun danced on Easter: used to 
get up early in the morning to see it. 
2 An ancient custom, called “lifting,” in England. 
The young men used to go around, carrying a chair 
decorated with ribbons, on the Monday after Easter. 
Each girl they met must take a seat in this chair. 
‘Then the men would lift her three times, as high as they 
could. 
The next day the women would go about with chairs 
and lift the men. The young women were dressed 
in their best, and the chair was sometimes fanci- 
fully decorated and lined with white. After the cere- 
mony, the men paid a forfeit of some money to each 
lifter. 
(Sometimes even kings used to be lifted by the ladies 
of the Court.) 
There are variations of this old custom in different places. 
Sometimes, with the forfeits collected, a kind of feast 
or party was held.

3 Easter Monday, in Chester, England. 
At a large cross, which stood in the road, the men of 
Chester used to have a game of football on Easter 
Monday. The mayor of the town, carrying his sword, 
stood near the cross; after the shoemakers of the place 
had given him a ball, the game began. The young 
women of Chester had a game of ball near a gate of the 
town, which was called the Pepper Gate. 
4 The Easter Egg. 
a The custom of using eggs at Easter time comes to us from 
very ancient times: It signified then, as now, creation 
or new birth. For this reason the Persians gave 
colored eggs at the time of their New Year, which they 
celebrated in the spring. The Hebrews also used eggs 
to a great extent at the time of their festival of the 
Passover, which is held at the beginning of spring, 
not far from the time of our Easter. 
6 After the introduction of Christianity, a special Easter 
egg was prepared and colored red. 
c Long ago in Europe, priests and singers used to have a 
game of ball with the Easter egg, while an Easter 
carol was sung. 
d A pretty legend believed by some people is that the joy- 
bells go away for a week before Easter; when they 
return on Easter Eve they bring with them scarlet 
eggs for the good children and they ring out joyfully 
to announce the Resurrection of Christ. 
e Additional customs connected with the Easter eggs: 
Children going around to collect eggs during Easter week. 
Giving eggs to friends on Easter Sunday in Russia. 
The game of hitting eggs, or rolling eggs down a hill, is 
still played in some places. The eggs which are 
cracked must be given to the owner of the eggs which 
remain uncracked. (Children’s egg-rolling at the 
White House in Washington.) 
Other legends and stories given later. 
5 Other ancient customs: About “the wind blowing east on 
Easter Day,” “the Easter King,” “Clipping the 
block,” at University College, Oxford, and “Clipping 
the church.” 
(These are described in “ Curiosities of Popular Customs,” 
by William S. Walsh, and might be used with chil- 
dren, although they are not especially good.)

IV Celebration of Easter 
1 In the Eastern countries. 
a When persons meet first on Easter morning, they kiss each 
other, and one says: “He is risen!” The other an- 
swers: “He is risen indeed!” 
6 Great rejoicing; bonfires lighted on hill-tops at night; 
feasting and festivities for a week. 
2 Very pretty midnight ceremony in the Greek church. 
(Lighting of the candles.) 
3 Easter music. 
Easter has been celebrated with music from early times. 
At Magdalen College, Oxford, England, carols are 
said to have been sung from the college tower on 
Easter morning for more than three hundred and fifty 
years. This custom was adopted by the students 
of a theological seminary in New York: Very early 
on Easter morning the sound of a trumpet is heard 
and high up in the belfry a company of men in caps 
and gowns may be seen. They sing the first carol 
facing toward the east; then they sing a carol to the 
west, to the north, and to the south. After this the 
chimes ring out their Easter message. 
4 Celebration of Easter in the United States. 
a In early history of our country, celebrated in the South, 
but not believed in by the Puritans. 
6 About the time of the Civil War Easter began to be cele- 
brated more generally. 
c Easter cards, Easter emblems, Easter songs, flowers in 
churches and as gifts used extensively in this country. 
V Story of the Origin of the Making of the Simnel Cake in England 
This is a story, which was told-long, long ago, about-the 
origin of a special kind of cake made for Easter in Shropshire, 
England. There once lived in their little cottage an old man 
and his wife. Now it happened one Easter time that their 
daughter Nelly and their son Simon came to see them. During 
Lent the people had been fasting and eating only unleavened 
bread, so when Nelly and her brother reached home, they found 
that there was nothing in the house for food except the dough 
from which this bread was made. Nelly said she would bake 
this into cakes for the younger children: while she was making 
them, she found some plum pudding, which had been left from 
Christmas. She thought she would use some of the plum pud- 
ding inside the cakes, cover it over with the dough, and bake
-P-A-G-E-82
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 241 
it hard so that people would be surprised to find the rich pud- 
ding inside. Nelly made the cake and was about to bake it 
when Simon came in and told her she ought to boil it. Nelly 
and Simon quarreled and even fought about whether the cake 
should be baked or boiled, until finally Nelly said she would 
boil it first and then bake it. They then built a fire; some eggs, 
which they had broken in their quarrel, they spread over the 
top of the cake to make it look well. This cake was so good 
that it became very popular. The people called it Simon- 
Nelly’s cake; but later they left off the last part of the two names 
and called it simnel cake for short. 
VI Easter Legend: “The Little Hare” 
(Adapted from a poem in The Youth’s Companion, April 29, 
1886.) 
The ‘Winter King” still held sway over the world, so the 
story goes, when one day long, long ago, he received a message 
that too late he was staying and he must give up his throne 
to the little “Prince Spring.” So the Winter King was obliged 
to go north, and Prince Spring came in his place. 
But “Prince Spring” was lonely and sad as he walked 
through the woods, notwithstanding the fact that the birds 
sang sweet songs at his approach, the streams burst through 
the ice under which King Winter had imprisoned them and tried 
to talk to him, and beautiful flowers sprang into life at his touch. 
Always before, the children had been the happiest of all at his 
return, but now no children had come to greet him, although 
he had waited many, many days. 
Finally, he thought: “I must send them some message to 
tell them that I am here; it must be that they do not know it. 
But whom shall I choose for a messenger?” It was very diffi- 
cult to find just the right one for this important errand. ‘The 
birds are very busy; the butterfly is tco small; I would not 
wish to trust the squirrel or the mouse,” said Prince Spring. 
Then suddenly he exclaimed to a little Hare: “You are just 
the one to please the children. Go to the town, and tell every- 
body that Spring has come.” But the poor little Hare was 
afraid to go to town, for fear he would be shot as all his brothers 
had been. So Spring went to each bird through all the forest, 
and from every one he asked a pretty egg; then he made a 
basket to hold the eggs; and gave them to the little Hare to use 
as gifts for the people in the town, so that no one would harm 
him.  
-P-A-G-E-83
242 HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
When the Hare reached the town, he was afraid of the 
grownup people; but whenever he saw a child, he sat up, held 
an egg out in his paw, and gave the message that Prince Spring 
had come. The joyful children rushed home to tell the news, 
while the Hare ran back to the forest with his empty basket. 
From this time, in memory of the little Hare, who brought the 
gift of eggs so long ago, the children are given sugar hares and 
beautiful colored eggs at the happy Easter season. 
- VII Story of the Easter Hare in. Germany 
1 The night before Easter in Germany. 
The children are greatly excited about the coming of the 
white hare. If they have been good, they believe the hare will 
come while they are asleep and hide beautifully colored eggs 
all over the house for them. The white hare interests the 
children so much that they do not notice how many eggs the 
mother brings home. When the little folks are safely in bed, 
the mother boils the eggs in print cloth of different patterns, 
so that they are beautifully colored. When the eggs are ready, 
the parents hide them, while the children are, perhaps, still 
listening for the white hare. 
2 Easter morning. 
The children are very anxious to know if the white hare 
has been there. The father and mother enter into the fun of the 
children. The father leads the hunt. For a long time no 
eggs are found and the children begin to be afraid the white 
hare has not visited them. At last, to the delight of the chil- 
dren, the first egg is discovered. Then some more of the wonder- 
ful eggs are found. 
(The rabbit instead of the hare is used in this country for 
Easter.)

SPRING AND EASTER 
AN ENTERTAINMENT IN ILLUSTRATION 
It is well to have some simple exercises at this season of the year, 
in order that the children may have an opportunity to express 
their joy at the return of spring. Even if no entertainment to 
which guests are invited is given, some form of expression should 
be used in the school-room. 
Stage Decorations 
Large boughs of hemlock and laurel or other green are ar- 
ranged around the sides and back of the stage. In among the 
green branches are placed red and white electric lights. 
A wooden fence, painted green or a hedge; a seat covered 
with gray cambric, near the fence; green boughs scattered over 
the stage; and a few trees complete the stage arrangements,

Characters 
Two young ladies or girls from one of the upper grades are 
needed: one to give an Easter poem and the other to represent 
Mother Spring. 
The other characters are the following: Children to repre- 
sent Easter; five girls from the Fourth Grade to recite a poem; 
children representing different flowers (First and Second 
Grade.) 
(Children to give a Spring Drill, or take part in one or two 
other tableaux may be added, if a longer entertainment is 
desired.) 
I Easter Time. (Tableau, poem, and song) 
The young woman or older girl is seated by the fence; some 
little girls are grouped about her, some seated and others 
standing. All wear white dresses; the children have white 
bands, with Easter lily decorations, on their heads, and hold 
Easter lilies. These Easter lilies are made of crépe paper wired 
into shape. 
(Directions for making the lilies are given in Dennison’s 
book, “Art and Decoration.’’) 
The older girl recites the poem by Celia Thaxter on “Easter,” 
found in the Ladies’ Home Journal, March, 1913. This poem 
begins, “Sing, children, sing!” She should give this poem as if 
talking to the children around her. 
After the poem, the older girl leads all the little children, 
inan informal manner, nearer to the front of the stage. 
All sing “At Easter Time,” Laura E. Richards—B. L. W. 
II “How Spring Made Her Flowers” 
Poem by Susie M. Day. (Wide Awake, April, 1879.) 
This poem is recited by five children, each giving a part of 
the poem. All the children together give these two lines last: 
“Does Spring always make her flowers this way? 
We can only tell what she did that day.” 
The girls who recite this poem wear the sunbonnets, kerchiefs, 
and sashes, decorated with crépe paper flowers, which are 
described under May. (Each child has a different flower.) 
Instead of the poem mentioned ebove, the following tableau 
and quotation might be used:

A very*small child is kneeling among tall Easter lilies and 
other flowers, or kneeling with her arms full of lilies and roses. 
She gives a quotation from “A Little Child’s Fancies,” by Mrs. 
L. C. Whiton: 
I think that the world was finished at night, 
Or the stars would not have been made; 
For they wouldn’t have thought of having the light, 
If they hadn’t first seen the shade. 
And I think that an angel, when nobody knew, 
With a window pushed up very high, 
Let some of the seeds of the flowers fall through, 
From the gardens they have in the sky. 
For they couldn’t think here of lilies so white, 
And such beautiful roses, I know; 
But I wonder, when falling from such a height, 
The dear little seeds should grow! 
And then, when the face of the angel was turned, 
I think that the birds flew by, 
And are singing to us the songs they learned 
On the opposite side of the sky. 
III Mother Spring Awaking Her Children 
An exercise for small children adapted from a poem, “Mother 
Spring’s Children,” by Clara Doty Bates, given in the Wide 
Awake, March, 1883. 
Mother Spring’s Children, or the flowers represented in this 
exercise, with description of costumes: 
Morning Glory — The costume is a surplice of white cambric, 
edged at neck and sleeves with pink crépe paper. Pink 
petals are placed at the openings for the sleeves also; a 
green vine is wound twice about the dress and on the vine 
are white and pink morning-glories made of tissue paper.‘ 
A little morning glory cap of tissue and crépe paper is 
worn. 
Dandelions — Two very small girls represent dandelions. They 
wear green cambric gowns, trimmed with dandelion leaves, 
cut from crépe paper, with here and there over the costume 
little tufts of yellow tissue paper to represent the blossoms. 
They have dandelion caps also.
-P-A-G-E-87
246 HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
Buttercup — The buttercup is represented by a small boy, who 
wears a cap and collar made to resemble the rounding petals 
and the green-calyx of the flower. 
Daisy — The costume for the daisy is a loose, thin green gown, 
with white daisy petals for collar and shoulder pieces. The 
cap is made with a green paper crown, surrounded by 
curled daisy petals. A close green cap, with little daisies 
on it, is used for a night-cap, when that is needed. 
Violet — The violet costume has green crépe paper leaves around 
the bottom, above which it is trimmed with violet tissue 
paper. There is a violet sash and hat. 
Jonquil — The foundation for this costume is green cambric; 
long strips of green paper go over the shoulders and from 
the neck to the lower part of the costume, these strips are 
fastened loosely. Jonquils of crépe paper trim the waist 
and there are two rows of these blossoms around the 
bottom. The cap has a row of jonquils. 
Maiden Hair — A white foundation, trimmed with little green 
sprays, is used. Her hair is wound with green. 
Sweet Pea — The little girl representing this flower wears a 
loose green gown, trimmed with sprays of pink sweet peas; 
also sweet pea shoulder pieces and a bonnet made in the 
shape of a sweet pea. 
Roses — There are two roses, a pink anda red. The costume is 
made with large rose petals around the bottom and sleeves, 
little band to match around the neck, strips of green paper 
from the neck to the petals, and a little rose or two on the 
upper part. A cap of rose petals with calyx and stem 
matches the costume. 
(The children representing the different flowers are nestled 
down about the stage, the little buttercup just behind the 
fence, the roses, way in back, one on each side, and others 
in front. They are in different attitudes, some stretched 
out at full length and some leaning on their arms, but they 
al Ihave their eyes closed and are apparently fast asleep. 
Mother Spring, represented by a tall girl or woman, enters 
from one of the wings.) 
Mother Spring The sun is out, but what are my children all 
about? (Looks around the stage, and then goes to one of the chil- 
dren.) 
Come, bright-eyed Morning Glory, 
You should be the first of all to wake.

See Violet now lifts her shy and modest head; 
A kerchief bonnet is tied upon it, 
A warm green leaf on her breast is spread.

has on all her yellow frills and ribbons this morning. (The 
jonquil jumps up quickly as soon as spoken to.)

IV Dance of the Spring Flowers 
(Before the dance, the trees, fence, and seat are taken from 
the stage.) 
Eight little girls from the second grade give this dance. They 
represent four flowers: the daisy, sweet pea, rose, and jonquil. 
The costumes for these flowers have been described in the 
previous exercise. The children for the dance also carry the 
flowers to match their costume. 
There are, of course, two children representing each of the 
four different flowers. A representative of the daisy, sweet pea, 
rose, and jonquil enters in the same order from each wing and 
dances across the back of the stage to the center, where they 
meet, bow to each other, then dance two by two down the 
middle of the stage to the center back again; then bowing and 
repeating. When they come down the middle of the stage to the 
front the third time, instead of the couples separating, they 
alternate; the first couple goes to the right, the second to the 
left and so on. The couples dance around the stage to the 
center back, where they form in the right order again, dancing 
one after the other to the front. This is repeated also. 
Next the couples separate again; the four children on the right 
go to that side of the stage, form and dance in a small circle at 
the right. The children on the left of the line do the same at
-P-A-G-E-91
250 HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
the left of the stage. For a few minutes the dance in the small 
circles is continued. 
At a signal (given by a change in the music or a chord struck 
on the piano) the two daisies, who are the smallest children 
and the leaders in the dance, leave the others, dance to position 
together in the center of the stage and stand there, while the 
other children form a large circle and dance around them. After 
the children have danced around the stage in front of the daisies 
twice, the daisies join the circle at the proper place. The two 
children representing the sweet pea go to the center now, while 
the others dance around them in the same way. Thus the 
dance continues; when the sweet peas come back into the circle, 
the roses go to the center; afterward the jonquils do the same. 
Then the jonquils return to the circle and all dance around the 
stage until the curtain is lowered. 
(If this dance is given late in the spring when there are plenty 
of flowers, a pretty ending would be, after the jonquils have re- 
turned to the circle, to have the children form two lines across 
the stage, and dance back and forth, throwing their flowers 
at each other.) 
V Shepherd’s Pipe Drill 
Ifa drill is desired for this entertainment, use first grade pupils. 
The following drill would be pretty. Have the children wear 
white dresses, with little caps and sandals of light green (the 
color of the first spring foliage); decorate the costume also 
with festoons of light green. The children carry shepherd’s 
pipes, made of reeds, or small maple branches. For the drill, 
any simple movements, as those suggested for the Red, White, 
and Blue Brigade under June, may be used. Between each 
movement, however, the children should blow upon their pipes. 
Additional Spring songs may be given with this entertain- 
ment, if desired.

IV The Establishment of Patriot’s Day, April 19th 
Reason for the name which is given to this day. Ex- 
plain, in simple form, the meaning of patriot and 
patriotism. Even in States where this day is not 
observed as a holiday, this is a good opportunity 
to explain and emphasize the meaning of heroism 
and patriotism. 
V Story of How Women and Girls Helped in the Revolution 
It is not a good plan to have children think that all the 
brave deeds are performed by soldiers. For this 
reason stories of what the women and children did 
for their country in the time of the Revolution should 
be told. These stories will also be of value in 
arousing the interest of the girls, and showing them 
that girls as well as boys can help their country. 
Story ABOUT THE WOMEN AND GIRLS IN THE TIME OF THE 
REVOLUTION 
When you hear stories of the Revolutionary War, you generally 
hear about the soldiers and their brave deeds. But don’t you 
suppose that the women and girls of that time were brave and 
loved their country as well as the men did? If your father was 
going away to war and you and your mother did not know but 
what he might be killed, just think how hard it would be for you! 
You would have to be very brave, if you were left all alone; and 
in the time of the Revolution it was still harder for the women. 
and children than it would be to-day, because the people did not 
live so close together and they were afraid of the English soldiers, 
and sometimes they were afraid that the Indians would attack 
them. Now I am going to tell you some of the ways in which 
the women and girls helped the men who were fighting for their 
country, and also some stories that show the bravery of the women. 
At the time of the Revolution the people did not have many of 
their spoons, knives, forks, and dishes made of silver and china 
as we do to-day; but most of the best ones they had were made 
of pewter. The women thought as much of their pewter dishes 
as your mother does of her best silver and china. However, 
although they did think so much of the pewter articles, when some 
of these women heard how difficult it was for the American soldiers 
to get bullets to use in fighting the British, they melted some of 
their pewter dishes and made bullets from them for the soldiers. 
(Show some pewter dishes, if possible.)
-P-A-G-E-98
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 257 
You remember that when England passed laws that the people 
in this country thought were unjust, most of them said that they 
would not buy articles from England any more. This made it 
very hard for the women. They could not buy any clothing, so 
they had to spin and weave their cloth and make all their dresses 
themselves. Because they were so anxious to gain their rights and 
thought that England was oppressing them, many of the richest 
people said they would not wear anything but this rough home- 
made clothing. Besides this, because they would not buy tea and 
other articles from England, the women had to think and plan 
what they could use in place of the things they had been buying 
from England. To make tea they sometimes used raspberry 
leaves. 
The women also took their old linen and made bandages to be 
used for the wounded soldiers. As the men joined together and 
formed bands called the “Sons of Liberty,” so the women formed 
bands called the ‘Daughters of Liberty.” These women did 
everything they could to help the soldiers and to work for their 
country. They met as often as they could and sewed for the 
soldiers. 
To show you how many of the women felt and how they sacri- 
ficed for the country, I will tell you about a letter which a woman 
of Philadelphia wrote to a British officer in Boston. In this letter 
the woman said something like this: ‘‘My only brothe: I have 
sent to the camp with my prayers. I hope he will not disgrace 
me; and if I had twenty sons and brothers they should go. I have 
not drunk tea since last Christmas, and have not bought a new 
cap or dress since your defeat at Lexington; and what I never 
did before, have learned to knit, and am now making stockings 
for my servants; and in this way I do a little for the public good. 
I know that as free I can die but once; but asa slave I shall not be 
worthy of life. All the women in America feel as I do. They 
have given up parties, tea drinking and finery, on account of love 
oftheir country. If these are the feelings of the women, what must 
be true of the men?”’ 
One of the stories about a brave American woman is this: At 
one time during the war, General Greene of the American army 
wanted to send a message to another general, who, with his divi- 
sion of the army, was many miles away. There was great danger 
that the messenger would be captured by the British, so it was 
difficult to find a man who was willing to go. One day a young 
girl, named Emily Geiger, came into camp and told General Greene 
that she would carry his message for him. The general was greatly 
pleased and he wrote a letter and gave it to her; he also told Emily
-P-A-G-E-99
258 HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
what the message was, so that, if she should lose her letter, she 
could still give the message. Emily rode on horseback and the 
second day of her journey she was captured by the British. The 
British officer thought Emily might have come from General 
Greene’s camp, so he shut her up and sent for a woman to search her. 
The woman, who was friendly to the British, soon arrived; but 
although she searched Emily carefully, she could find nothing sus- 
picious and Emily was allowed to go on her journey. What do 
you suppose Emily had done with General Greene’s letter? She was 
a girl who could think quickly what to do and when she was left 
alone, before the woman came to search her, she ate up the letter, 
piece by piece. That was rather a strange meal, wasn’t it? After 
this Emily traveled the rest of the way safely and told General 
Greene’s message to the other general. 
Mrs. Richard Shubrick was another brave American woman. 
Once an American sol 
house to escape. The 
with many threats that the man should be given up. ier, pursued by the British, ran into her 
British soldiers followed and demanded 
All the 
other women were too much frightened to do anything; but Mrs. 
Shubrick, although she was not strong, placed herself at the 
door of the room in which the American soldier had hidden him- 
self, and said she wow 
honor,” she said, “the 
British officer admired id defend it with her life. ‘To men of 
room of a lady should be sacred.” The 
her bravery so much that he ordered his 
men to leave the house. 
Long ago, on that April morning you have been hearing about, 
a little girl in Cambridge was watching a cow which was feeding 
by the roadside. The little girl’s name was Nabby Blackington 
and she was all alone. Suddenly she heard the sound of many 
horses’ hoofs and of men marching. Then she saw gay banners, 
scarlet coats, and bayonets. Twelve hundred British soldiers 
were marching from Boston that morning to meet and help the 
British who had gone to Lexington and Concord the night before. 
The little girl stood still and watched the soldiers. But the cow 
had stopped eating and she started to cross the road right in 
among the soldiers. Nabby followed toward the bristling weapons, 
for was it not her duty to take care of the cow? The wondering 
soldiers saw the little girl, with her sunbonnet fallen from her 
head, her frightened eyes, and brown cheeks. Far away across 
the ocean many a soldier seemed to see the green meadows and 
beautiful flowers of his own home; and in place of the child cross- 
ing the road, he saw. his own little girl in old England; and he 
smiled as he looked. Then the soldiers murmured softly, ‘We 
will not hurt the child.” The signal for a halt was quickly given  
-P-A-G-E-100
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION — 259 
and little Nabby went safely through the ranks of soldiers to join 
her cow. Then the soldiers marched on toward Concord. 
Oft told in story and sung in song, 
The deeds of that day to the world belong. 
And the scenes of that time have power to thrill 
The heart of a mighty nation still; 
But whenever the tales of the ancient strife, 
And the forms of its heroes start to life, 
One picture will always come up to me; 
The girl and the grazing cow I see, 
And the troops to the signal have halted swift, 
And the plumes on the soft air gayly drift, 
And the highway burns with the column’s red, 
As when “We will not hurt the child,” they said. 
—Virginia L. Townsend 
Suggestions for making the work more interesting 
If it is desired to make the work more interesting to the pupils, 
by allowing them to imagine they are living at the time and taking 
part in some of the events connected with the Revolution, or if 
the teacher wishes to give exercises to which the parents may be 
invited, simple imitations of the costume of the time may be used. 
The little girls may wear caps and kerchiefs. For the boys hats 
may be made from construction paper; buckles and epaulettes 
of gilt paper, neck pieces of white cambric, and bands of flannel 
or cloth for the front of their coats may also be made. These 
simple arrangements for costumes give quite satisfactory results. 
Life in the time of the Revolution should be emphasized. 
Articles of interest should be shown and visits to places connected 
in any way with the Revolution should be taken, if possible. 
The suggestions in regard to representing scenes in the school- 
room which were given for the Colonial Period under November 
may be applied to the Revolutionary Period also.

B Heros AND PATRIOTISM 
Stories about Heroes or Patriots of To-day 
It is not well to have children feel that there is less oppor- 
tunity for bravery and patriotism to-day than in the past. 
Therefore stories of brave deeds to-day should be connected 
with those of long ago. In order to make these stories more 
interesting to the children, white bands with the names of the 
heroes in gilt upon them may be made; also a white banner with 
the words, “Heroes or Patriots of To-day,” on it. The stories 
of the heroes are told to the pupils; after a story has been told, 
some boy is allowed to pretend that he is that hero and have 
the name pinned on him. When all the stories chosen for one
-P-A-G-E-102
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 261 
lesson have been told, a boy is allowed to come up front and 
hold the banner. The boys who have the names pinned on 
thern are called upon, each in turn to come up front and tell 
the story of the particular hero he is representing. Afterwards 
other boys may wear the bands and tell the stories. 
I First Stories (For one lesson) 
In the stories that we have been having this month, can 
you tell the names of any brave men you have heard of? Why 
do you think these men were brave? What did they do for 
their country? Do you know of any persons living to-day who 
have done brave deeds? Sometimes people have a chance to 
do brave things when there is no war and to help their country 
in other ways besides fighting; and sometimes even boys and 
girls are very brave and help others. To-day I am going to tell 
you some stories of brave boys and men, who did not live a long 
long time ago, but who belong to our own time, and so are heroes 
or patriots of to-day. 
In the western part of our country there lived a little news- 
boy, named William Rugh. He was a poor little cripple, and 
very few in Gary, Indiana, where he lived, knew anything about 
him. One day he heard about a woman who was in the hospital 
and had a very bad wound which would not heal unless some 
skin could be obtained to graft on the wound. William thought 
about the woman and he wanted to save her life. So the little 
boy told the doctors that he wanted his crippled leg cut off, in 
order that skin might be grafted from it to help the sick 
woman. The doctors said: “It may kill you to have your leg 
cut off.” But William Rugh answered: “Go ahead; it may 
save her.” It did, but William Rugh died. Now the people of 
Gary are talking about building a monument to this brave little 
newsboy. 
The next little hero that I am going to tell you about was 
an Eskimo and lived in the cold north country of Labrador. 
(The story is told by Dr. Hutton, in “Among the Eskimos of 
Labrador.”) One day this little Eskimo boy, named Jakko, 
started out very early, with his brother Rena, for the edge of the 
ice after'seals. They had a harpoon and a gun. Before long 
Jakko shot a seal, but it was only wounded; it floated on the 
water, too weak to dive. The boys had no boat, and they must 
reach the seal. What do you think they used for a boat? 
Just as the Eskimos often do, they climbed on a piece of loose 
ice and paddled with their hands toward the seal. They went 
along pretty well until they were near enough to the seal for
-P-A-G-E-103
  
    
 
-P-A-G-E-104
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION — 263 
Jakko to use his harpoon. Jakko stood up while his brother 
paddled to steady the ice-raft. Jakko was now all ready to 
strike with the harpoon, when the ice began to slowly turn over. 
At first the boys were thinking about the seal and did not notice 
their danger. Then Jakko cried, as ths movement of the ice 
increased, “Stay where you are, Rena!” end jumped into the 
water. Jakko knew that if both stayed on the ice, it would 
upset and both would be thrown into the water. Jakko could 
swim a little, but his brother Rena could not swim at all. The 
ice stopped turning over, and although Rena was nearly thrown 
off, he managed to hold on. For a long, long time Rena paddled 
all around looking for Jakko, but he could not find him. The 
water was very, very cold and Jakko must have been drowned. 
Rena finally had to go back alone, to the ice fields. Jakko had 
given up his life for his little brother. 
Once a boy named Harry Squires went out in a sail boat. 
‘There were six in the boat; and at first the wind was good and 
the boat sailed splendidly. The boat was named The Miramar. 
Suddenly the wind stopped blowing and you know in that case 
a sail boat cannot go. The yacht drifted about and the tide 
began to drive it toward the reef and breakers near shore. So 
the anchor was dropped over the side of the boat to keep it 
from going upon the rocks; but the chain to which the anchor 
was attached had been unfastened from the boat and so the 
chain, anchor and all went to the bottom of the sea and were lost 
forever. If The Miramar was driven in among those great 
waves and sharp rocks on shore, it would certainly be wrecked, 
and some, if not all, the persons on the ship would !ose their 
lives. Squires tied one end of a fishing-line about his waist, 
took off his shoes and jumped into the water. About two 
hundred yards below the drifting Miramar, above the line 
of breakers, was fastened a buoy. (Explain meaning cf buoy.) 
Squires began to swim toward this buoy. Those left on the 
boat watched him anxiously. Would his strength hold out until 
he reached it? Now the boat is coming very close to the surf 
and to the watchers it seems as if Squires is growing weaker. 
‘Then suddenly they see that he has reached the buoy, and sits 
astride of it. He pulls in the two-inch rope that the people in the 
boat have tied to the end of the fishing-line; fastens it round 
the ring bolt, and waves his hand to those in the boat to tell 
them it is all right. The boat and the people in it are saved be- 
cause of Harry Squires’ bravery; but they are very close to the 
surf. The boat swings at the end of the line for two hours, and 
all that time Harry sat on the buoy, watching the end of the
-P-A-G-E-105
264 HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
rope. Finally the tide turned and they were able to rescue 
Harry Squires from the buoy. 
Another person, older than those I have been telling you 
about, gave up his home and friends in this country to help the 
people of China. This man was Warren Seabury. He went 
through college and became a minister. Then, although he 
loved his country and friends very much, he decided that the 
people in China needed help and that he would like to work to 
help them. He went bravely, smiling and letting few know that 
it was hard for him. He worked earnestly and did a great deal 
of good; and not long afterwards he died like a hero. 
(These stories are adapted from accounts given in the 
Youth’s Companion.) 
II Other Stories of Brave Deeds 
One day a workman, named Andy Ronald, was standing 
on a ledge, when he saw another workman fall down the shaft of 
amine. He did not wait a moment, but dived after the man, 
although he did not know the distance to the bottom of the hole. 
He landed ninety feet below in muck and water ten feet deep. 
Although he was severely injured, he groped about and found 
his fellow-workman, who was unconscious. Some of the other 
miners then saved them both. 
Major Ford, a doctor in our army, was on leave, and hap- 
pened to be in Constantinople when the Balkan War broke out. 
When the Turks began to retreat from the city, many sick and 
wounded were left there. They had no care. So Major Ford 
began to help them. He organized the work of the American 
Red Cross, which is a society to relieve suffering in time of 
war and in other cases of great need; he also established a field 
hospital for the Turkish Red Cross Society; and helped the sick 
and suffering as much as possible. A few persons offered to help 
Major Ford in caring for the sick; but at first there were very 
few. There is an American college for girls in Constantinople; 
some of the girls who go to this school are Greeks and Bulgarians, 
thus belonging to two of the countries that were at war on the 
opposite side — against the Turks; but for two days work at the 
school was given up and all the teachers and pupils helped to care 
for the wounded in the army of the enemy. 
There are many stories of the bravery of men on submarine 
boats. One of the best of these is about Lieutenant Groves, 
an Englishman. In July, 1908, he and Lieutenant Warren 
were together on one of these boats, when they saw that gaso- 
line was escaping from the engines. They found that all the
-P-A-G-E-106
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 265 
members of the crew were lying unconscious about the ship. 
They tried several times to reach the engines; but the gasoline 
was so strong they could not succeed. At last they wrapped 
their faces in their coats, but Warren was overcome even then. 
Groves managed to reach the place and turn off the gasoline, 
but he fell unconscious across the engine. When men from 
another ship came to rescue them, it seemed as if all on the 
submarine boat were dead. After much work and a long time, 
however, all the crew were saved. 
III There should be told also stories of heroines and of the 
brave deeds of women at the present time. 
A good illustration of what one woman was able to do to help 
her country is found in the story of Sophie B. Wright of New 
Orleans. Sophie Wright was very, very poor, and she was also 
a cripple from the effects of a fall which she had when she was 
only three years old. She worked hard to obtain an education 
and then taught school in order to support herself. A young 
man, who was very anxious to learn, but could not go to the 
schools of the city, came to see Sophie Wright and she taught 
him. This man told her how many boys and young men there 
were in the city who were growing up in ignorance, and thus 
would not make good citizens. The noble woman wished to 
help these poor boys, so she borrowed a large sum of money and. 
established a night school. Workers in the factories came to this 
school; it grew, and others became interested in it. The people 
of the city said this woman had done more than any other citi- 
zen to help New Orleans, so they gave her a beautiful silver cup 
and they also raised money for her school. Although Sophie 
Wright suffered a great deal of pain, she continued her work. 
Boys who were idle on the streets were influenced to come to her 
school; a band of these boys, called the “Spasm Band,” was 
reformed and the boys became good citizens. 
Stories and illustrations along this line can be found in 
magazines and newspapers almost every day. The stories 
may illustrate heroes of a certain occupation or class one day, as 
heroes among firemen; then another time heroes among police- 
men, etc. The bands and banners would be changed to corre- 
spond. 
p It is better not to choose many soldiers for heroes in this 
work, because we have enough stories of brave soldiers in the 
regular history; it is also better to have some of the stories 
about humble deeds of heroism.

PATRIOT’S DAY 
AN ENTERTAINMENT IN ILLUSTRATION 
I Story of Paul Revere’s Ride 
The story is told by the teacher or some older pupil. Some 
of the children are dressed so as to suggest the Revolutionary 
period and are grouped about the story teller, thus forming a 
tableau at the same time that the story is being told. 
II The Farmer Soldier 
1 A Minute-man of 1775. 
A little boy dressed to represent a minute-man or farmer 
of the period comes to the front of the stage and says: 
“Tam ready to answer my country’s call at any minute, for 
that reason I am called a Minute-man.” 
The boy should carry a powder horn and musket; his 
collar may be turned down and sleeves rolled up; a good repre- 
sentation of the hats of the period may be made from construc- 
tion paper or from an old felt hat. The costume may be made 
more exact if desired. (See the statue of the Minute-man at 
Concord.) 
The school may answer the Minute-man with the quota-

It may be arranged so that those on one side are all boys 
and all wear the imitation Revolutionary hats or something 
else to designate them as Revolutionary soldiers. Half the 
school repeat together the following: 
“We trust in God that, should the state of our affairs 
require it, we shall be ready to sacrifice everything dear in life, 
and life itself, in support of the common cause.” 
The other half of the school responds: 
“They kept their pledge, on the 19th of April, 1775.”

North Church (points up as if to the belfry) as a signal to me. 
The Friend 1 will watch; and if the soldiers march by 
lard, I will put up one lantern, but if they go by sea, I will hang 
two lanterns in the belfry. 
Paul Revere I will be ready, and if I see the signal, I will 
ride to Lexington and Concord. I will wake up the people 
along my way and tell them to arm because the British are 
coming. Good-night.

OUTLINES AND SUGGESTIONS FOR LESSONS AND StoRY Work 
A May Day 
I Ancient May Day Customs and Celebrations in Great Britain 
1 In the Scottish Highlands. 
The people used to have great bonfires, and the young 
men had a curious custom connected with a cake of 
oatmeal. Outside of each village, the young men 
assembled on May Day. They built a fire, and 
cooked a kind of custard and a cake of oatmeal. 
The custard was eaten, and the cake was divided 
among them by lot in the following manner. Enough 
pieces were cut, so that each person might have one. 
Now one of these pieces was blackened by means 
of charcoal and then they were all put in a bonnet, 
such as the Highlanders of Scotland wore. Each 
person was then blindfolded, and drew out a piece 
in turn. Whoever drew the black piece of cake was 
obliged to jump three times through the bonfire. 
This ceremony was supposed to give them good 
harvests in the autumn. 
2 In Ireland, the people would light fires, and compel the 
cattle to go between them. 
3 In England. (When these May Day customs were intro- 
duced into England is unknown.) 
a May-dew. 
The people would go maying early in the morning and 
bathe their faces in the dew. This was supposed 
277
-P-A-G-E-119
278 HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
to make their cheeks rosy, or in some accounts it is 
said to remove freckies. 
b The May-dolls. 
It was once common in England for the girls to carry 
around a doll, decorated with ribbons and flowers, 
and seated in a small chair. In Cambridge the 
doll was hung in a hoop around which flowefs were 
twined. 
c Gathering the flowers, or “gathering May.” 
In the night or very early in the morning the people 
would go into the woods to gather flowers, vines, 
and branches of trees with which to decorate their 
homes. 
d The Queen of the May. 
A queen of the May was chosen, crowned, and ruled 
for one day. She presided over the May Day 
festival. 
e Queen’s Court. 
All the people of a village generally entered into the 
May Day sports. 
Introduction of Robin Hood and members of his band 
into the celebration. 
The morris-dancers. 
Walsh, in “Curiosities of Popular Customs,” says that, 
“A pasteboard hobby-horse ridden by a man was 
sent around among the spectators to collect contri- 
butions in a ladle stuck in its mouth.” 
f May-pole. ae 
Generally a birch pole, decorated with flowers and 
ribbons. This May-pole was sometimes gotten ready 
the night before May Day, but in some places in 
England May-poles might always be seen in the 
streets. 
To dance around the May-pole was free to all. 
g The May Day sprig. 
It is said that in many Cornish towns, it was the cus- 
tom for everyone to pick a sprig from the “narrow- 
leaf” elm tree early on the first day of May. If any- 
one was without this sprig, which was called “‘ May” 
and must be worn where it could be easily seen, he 
must be careful to keep away from brooks or streams 
of water. Stationed at these streams would be 
found all the boys of the town, armed with “‘dipping- 
horns.”’ If anyone came by not wearing the May

Day sprig, the boys would cry: “Ha’ penny or a 
penny, or a good wet back”; and if the money were 
not given at once, the person would receive a good 
wetting. 
A Only in rural England are there survivals of the May Day 
celebrations, which were once so popular.

1 Cowslip. 
One summer, a long, long time ago, the cowslip had no 
golden blossoms. After that all through the winter the cow- 
slip slept under the leaves and snow; but one morning in May 
she heard the robin sing. In order to hear better, she put her 
head up out of the ground, and saw both the robin and a 
golden sunbeam. The cowslip was so glad that she laughed 
low and sweet: “Ha! ha! ha! ha!” and every “Ha! ha!” 
became a golden blossom. The cowslip was surprised and 
hung her pretty head; and ever since that time, each cowslip 
laughs itself into blossom “‘when it hears the robin and sees 
the sunbeam of merry May.”’ — Kindergarten Stories
-P-A-G-E-121
280 HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
2 Dandelion. 
Long, long ago some little stars that lived in the sky 
were naughty. They would not shine at night when their 
mother, the moon, told them to. What do you think hap- 
pened to these naughty little stars? They fell way down 
into the ground. Then the little stars felt very sorry and 
began to cry. When the sun, their father, saw how sorry 
they were, he said they might come up from under the ground 
and shine upon the earth instead of in the sky. So every day 
in summer we see the stars shining in the grass. 
3 Hawthorn or May. 
This flower grows wild in almost every country in 
Europe, and it has been associated in many places with differ- 
ent May Day customs. You can often see, in the Pyrenees, a 
little cross surrounded with May boughs placed in the edge of 
the fields. This is supposed to ensure a bountiful harvest 
and the following story accounts for the custom: 
In the early days of Christianity, a poor peasant became 
ill and could not work in his fields; so some of this man’s 
neighbors said they would help him and they came to dig 
and plant the land for him. They worked for two days and 
had the fields in good condition. Happening to look over 
to their own fields, as they were finishing the work for the 
sick man, they saw a sight at which they wondered greatly. 
Three little children, dressed in white and wearing wreaths of 
May on their heads, were planting branches of hawthorn 
there. What could be the object of the children? Suddenly 
they saw that the little children, with wings outspread, were 
flying up to the sky, singing. It was discovered after this 
that all the fields which had been marked by them gave 
double harvests. 
4 Daisy. 
Across the ocean in England they tell this legend about 
the daisy. Long, long ago, when the Romans conquered 
England, they persecuted and killed the Christians of the 
country. Saint Druon, who lived in that country then, said 
to his sister one day, “Sister, I am a priest, so I must die at my 
post, and without fear I await the death of a martyr. But, 
thou, my child, canst not with thy sisters incur the dangers 
that I see lie before us. Thou must leave me, and with them 
seek a place of refuge where thou canst pray to God in safety.” 
At first his sister, Saint Olle, was unwilling to go, but she
-P-A-G-E-122
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION — 281 
finally did as her brother wished and left the country. A 
year later the Romans stopped treating the Christians so 
cruelly, and Saint Druon was anxious for his sister’s return. 
It was not easy, however, to find her, for he had no clue to her 
whereabouts. He started out to hunt for her and thought 
he would follow the first straight path he came to. It was 
autumn at this time, but as he went on his way, “little tufts 
of flowers with yellow centers, surrounded by a crown of white 
rays, seemed to spring up out of the earth before him.” He 
thought they were shining like stars to do away with the 
darkness of the night for him. He followed where the star- 
shaped flowers led and after nine days, he found his sister. 
From this time it is said that daisies blossom on the earth at 
all seasons of the year. 
5 Roses 
The rose is the queen of flowers and there are many 
legends about it. The first rose was supposed to have been 
white. One legend tells that Eve, in Paradise, put her lips on 
the petals of a white rose and they became red; and thus the 
first red rose was born. Another story about the origin of the 
red rose is the following: A beautiful girl, in a country far 
away, had been accused of crime, and in a field called Floridus, 
on the banks of the Euphrates River, sticks or fagots were 
lighted, for she was to be burned to death. Then the girl 
prayed that God would show that she was innocent. After 
the prayer, she entered the fire; and the sticks were changed 
to beautiful roses. The ones that were on fire when she 
entered became red roses and the others that had not com- 
menced to burn white roses. 
About the moss-rose the following legend is told: The 
Angel of Flowers, who takes care of them and waters them 
with dew, went to sleep one day under a rosebush. When he 
awoke, rested, he said to the rose which he loved, “I thank 
thee for thy nice cool shade, in return ask what thou wilt and 
I will give it thee.’ The rose blushed and answered, “Be- 
stow on me another grace.” A soft veil of moss to cover it, 
was the only additional beauty which the Angel could think 
of, so he bestowed this upon the lovely rose, and everyone 
admired this moss-rose. 
The Romans long ago loved the roses just the same as we 
do to-day. People who lived long ago used the rose as the 
symbol of silence. They said that once Cupid had a secret, 
so he gave a rose to Harpocrates, the God of Silence, if he
-P-A-G-E-123
82 HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
would promise not to tell. After this, among the Romans, 
it was thought that if anything was told ‘“‘sub rosa,” “under 
the rose” it must not be mentioned, but was a secret. When 
they were having feasts, they would hang a rose over the 
table, and then no one must tell anything that was said. 
Sometimes you will hear people use this same expression, 
“sub rosa,” to-day. 
In the villages of France, roses are given to the most 
popular girl, who is chosen and treated somewhat like the May 
Queen in England. Formerly three times a year, the youngest 
nobleman of France gave a basket of roses to the members of 
Parliament. (The men who meet together and make the 
laws for the country.) The young nobleman came first, 
carrying a large silver bowl of roses. Musicians followed, 
playing on their harps. They were all decorated with gar- 
lands of roses. 
An old Persian fable says that one day a poet was walking 
in his rose-garden, when he saw near a rose-bush some com- 
mon grass growing. He started to pull it up, saying, “What 
business has this horrid grass-seed to be in my garden? It 
is not fit to appear in the company of roses.” “ Do not destroy 
me,” said the little grass; “I know I am not a beautiful 
rose, but you can tell by my fragrance that I am a friend of 
roses.” And you all know that the scent is as sweet as 
that of a rose when you pass a field of new-mown hay in the 
summer time. 
6 Morning Call. 
There is a flower which grows in France and is named 
“Morning Call,”’ because of the following legend. The story 
might be told of our own Morning Glory. 
One day St. Nicholas met a little girl, who was crying on 
her way to school. ‘Why are you crying, little girl?” he 
asked. “I am late to school again,” said the little golden- 
haired child, “and I fear the teacher will scold me and say I 
am lazy, when it is not really my fault.” The saint put his 
hand on the girl’s head and comforted her. ‘You will not 
be scolded to-day,” he said, “for I have put back the hands 
of all the clocks in the village. But hereafter take this flower 
(handing her the root of a little flower which grew near), put it at 
the head of your bed and pray that you may wake early in 
the morning.” After this the child was always the first to 
reach the school in the morning and the plant St. Nicholas 
had given her began to receive the name, “ Morning Call.”
-P-A-G-E-124
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 283 
When any of the village people wished to wake early in the 
morning, they would put a branch of this flower by their 
bed. 
7 Narcissus. 
In a land far away, where the people used to believe many 
stories and legends about the flowers, there once lived a 
handsome young man. This youth, while hunting one day, 
became lost in the woods. After wandering about for a long 
time, he came to a sheltered spot, in which was a sparkling 
fountain. So quiet and peaceful was the place that it seemed 
as if no one had ever been there before. The young man re- 
joiced, for he was very tired and he wished to drink from the 
cool stream. He looked down into the clear depths of the 
water, and there he saw the loveliest maiden he had ever 
beheld. He was unable to remove his eyes for a moment 
from the beautiful face of the water-nymph. So he gazed and 
gazed, and he loved her more and more, so that he felt he never 
could leave her. He stayed all night by the fountain. Many, 
many days passed, and still found him there, and as he had 
nothing to eat, he grew weaker and weaker, and finally died. 
There at the fountain, after many days, his friends discovered 
him and were very sorrowful. They were about to light a 
funeral pyre in his honor, when they saw, that in the place 
where the body of the young man had been, a beautiful flower 
was growing. Now the young man’s name was Narcissus, 
and so this name was given to the flower, which blossomed 
in memory of him. 
8 Forget-me-not. (A German story.) 
Once a young man and woman were walking together by 
a swift flowing river. The girl wore a small blue flower, and 
as she walked by the river, the flower fell into the water. The 
man jumped into the river to get the flower for her, but 
the current was too strong for him; and as he was swept 
away, he threw the little blue flower to the woman, saying, 
“Forget-me-not.” Thus the forget-me-not received its 
name. 
Another story tells that, when God gave the flowers their 
names, one little blue flower came back to Him. This little 
flower was very sad, for it had forgotten its name. So the 
blue flower was called “Forget-me-not,” in order that it 
might never forget its name again.
-P-A-G-E-125

9 Thistle. (Two stories about the thistle.) 
In the army of the great Emperor Charlemagne, many 
of the soldiers were very sick and thousands of them died. 
So Charlemagne was very sad, and he prayed to God. Then 
in his sleep he seemed to see an angel, who shot an arrow. 
The angel told Charlemagne that with the plant upon which 
the arrow fell, he could make his soldiers well. The story 
says that this really came true. 
The thistle is the national emblem of Scotland and this 
is a story they tell in that country about it. When the Danes 
invaded Scotland, they tried to surprise the Scotch army one 
night, and, in order not to be heard, they marched bare- 
footed. They stole softly to the Scottish camp, but just as 
they reached it, one of the Danes stepped on a thistle, and 
it hurt him so that he cried out with pain. At this, the sleep- 
ing soldiers awoke, seized their weapons, and defeated the 
enemy. In this way the thistle saved Scotland and became 
the emblem of the country. 
10 Lily. 
The word lily means whiteness. This flower is the 
national flower of France. 
This is one of the legends about the lily. Once there 
lived at the foot of the Hartz Mountain in a little cottage a 
beautiful girl named Agnes. The Lord of the Castle of 
Lanenburg saw her one day and urged her to go with him to 
his castle. Agnes ran home and told her mother. The 
mother said that the cruel lord had taken many girls to his 
castle who had never been seen afterward; and she persuaded 
Agnes to enter a convent in order to escape from him. ‘The 
lord was very angry when he found out where Agnes had 
gone; he called together his vassals, attacked the convent, 
and carried Agnes home to his castle. When they reached 
there, suddenly the wicked lord saw that Agnes had disap- 
peared, and in her place wasa _eautiful white lily. A troop 
of fairies, who had rescued the frightened girl, danced about, 
singing: 
“The lily fair in the morning air, 
Sends out its sweet perfume, 
But its charms so rare cannot ensnare — 
We must fly away on the broom.” 
Since this time it is said that once every year a beautiful white 
lily blooms at midnight near Agnes’ home, and that the lily 
is so brilliant that it sheds light far around it.

11 Water-lily. 
According to tradition, water-lilies were obtained in the 
following manner: A good woman, called Saint Olle, had 
adopted an orphan child and loved her as her own. One day 
this child became ill with a fever and, after many days, 
seemed to be dying. Saint Olle prayed earnestly that she 
might recover. The next morning, when she looked out, she 
saw the water of a marsh near by covered with beautiful pond 
lilies. The air became pure and the fever no longer troubled 
the people of that neighborhood. The child grew stronger 
every day and Saint Olle rejoiced to see her restored to health 
again. On account of this the flower is sometimes called 
“Lily of our Lady.” 
12 Palestine Lily. 
About a lily that grows in Palestine and whose globes 
hang downward like bells, with a little drop of juice at the 
end of each petal, the following German legend is told. These 
drops of juice are called by many persons tears. Although 
there were many flowers that grew in the Garden of Geth- 
semane, this lily was the most beautiful of all. At the tim> 
Christ lived in Palestine the bell-shaped blossoms stood upright 
onthe stems. Christ loved the flowers and spent many hours 
in this beautiful garden. As He passed, all the flowers, except 
this proud lily, “bent their graceful heads to do Him honor.” 
The lily thought herself more beautiful than the other flow- 
ers, and would not bow her head. When Christ saw this, 
He looked sorrowfully at her, and “immediately the lily 
in self-reproach drooped her graceful head, her crown was 
reversed, the petals were stained with blushes, and the little 
tear-drops were formed which may be seen now.” The 
change in color and position of the flower has remained ever 
since that time.

SuGGESTIONS FOR MAKING THE WoRK INTERESTING 
A May-Day celebration outdoors, or acting some May-Day cere- 
monies in the school-room in connection with the school work. 
Preparations — Early May Day Morning or the Day Before 
The children go out into the woods to gather flowers, green 
vines, and branches. They make the flowers and branches 
into long wreaths and garlands. The May-pole is brought and 
decorated. 
If the school is situated near the woods, the celebration may 
be held there; the children bring their lunches; a bonfire is 
built, and they eat their lunch around it. The boys help prepare 
the May-pole; the girls decorate it. 
If the children cannot go to the woods, simple arrangements 
for the celebration of May Day may be made in the school-yard 
or in the school-room. 
Characters

Costumes — All the children may have something to wear 
which is suggestive of May Day. This might be-hats or sun- 
bonnets, made of cardboard covered with flower crépe paper, 
and shoulder bands or sashes and kerchiefs with the crépe paper 
flowers sewed on them. The girls would enjoy making these 
themselves. 
Instead of all the children having something special to wear 
for May Day, the queen, the page, and the maids-of-honor alone 
may wear something to distinguish them from the others. 
Throne for the queen: Any simple arrangement in the school- 
room or yard; if in the woods, choose the best rock or natural

upon this tree; this cross-piece should be nailed so that one- 
fourth of the pole is left above it. A large hoop is fastened to the 
top of the May-pole, and one is placed also at each end of the 
cross-piece. The pole, cross-piece, and hoops are wound with 
alternating strips of white and red crépe paper, or cloth. Fes- 
toons of green vines, laurel branches, and flowers are also 
used for decorating the pole. Red and white strips of cloth 
or ribbons hang from the pole just below the cross-piece. 
Choosing the May Queen 
The children stand in a circle, and each writes the name of 
some one for May Queen. When it has been discovered which 
one has been elected queen, she stands in the center of the 
circle. Taking hold of hands, the other children dance about 
the queen, bowing and singing: 
“We hail sweet , Queen of May, 
Let none dispute her gentle sway.”   
Crowning the May Queen 
The queen chooses two of the girls to act as her maids-of-honor. 
If the celebration is given in the school-room, and the children 
are to make any changes in costume, they leave the room now, 
and return in procession, with the queen leading, followed by the 
maids-of-honor. The queen may have a little boy for her page, 
and two little girls as flower girls. 
The queen advances to her throne, which is decorated with 
green boughs and flowers; she is crowned with a wreath of 
loners, and the children throw little sprays of green or flowers 
at her. 
After this, all the commands for the ceremonies are issued 
by the queen. The queen now directs the May-pole to be 
set up. All take hold of the pole, and march along with it, 
two by two, as they sing: 
“Sweet queen, the graceful May-pole see, 
We raise unto the day and thee.”

May-pole dance 
They raise the May-pole slowly into position. Then each 
child takes hold of one of the strips of ribbon or cloth hanging 
from the pole and they dance around the pole, twining the 
strips around it and finally fastening them. They sing: 
“Tn merry dance upon the green 
We pay sweet homage to the queen.” 
(This May Day celebration is adapted from a description in 
“Concord Picnic Days,” by G. B. Bartlett.) 
May Day Games. 
The queen directs the games. One of the games that may be 
played is described in “Concord Picnic Days,” by G. B. Bart- 
lett. 
Twelve feet in front of the May-pole and twelve feet at the 
back lines are drawn. The children stand facing the pole, six 
on each of these lines. The maids-of-honor pass baskets from 
which the children take balls colored red, blue, or white. (Tennis 
balls, covered with crépe paper may be used.) The red and 
blue balls must be thrown through the upper hoop. The white 
balls are to be thrown through the lower hoops. White balls 
count one; colored balls two. The children play in turn, as the 
queen calls out their names; she takes one first from one side 
and then from the other. Ifa player is able to catch a ball 
thrown through the hoop by the other side he can try to throw 
it back again and, if successful, it counts on his score. The 
score is kept by the queen, and she crowns with a wreath as 
victor the child who has the highest score. 
In England hundreds of years ago this game was played, and 
those who missed the hoop were obliged to pay the following 
forfeit. They were called ‘“‘goslings”; the girl-goslings must 
drive a peg into the ground, each hitting it once with a stick 
while they all stand around it blindfolded. The boy-goslings 
were compelled to pick this peg out of the ground with their 
teeth. 
(If there is not room to play the whole of this game, the 
children may try throwing the balls through the hoops, with- 
out returning them. In this manner, it may be played even 
in a school-room, if care is taken not to hit the windows.)

At the conclusion of the games, the children take the wreaths 
of flowers they have made and the green from the May-pole, and 
decorate themselves with them. (Instead of this, they may

to their homes, or around thé school-room or yard, the queen

6 Origin of the observance of Memorial or Decoration Day. 
In an address given by Chauncey M. Depew in New 
York on May 30, 1879, he said: “When the war was 
over in the South, where symbols and emblems 
are better understood than in the practical North, 
the widows, mothers, and children of the Confeder- 
ate dead went out and strewed their graves with 
flowers; at many places the women scattered them 
impartially also over the unknown and unmarked 
resting-places of the Union soldiers. As the news 
of this touching tribute flashed over the North it 
roused, as nothing else could have done, national 
amity and love and allayed sectional animosity and 
passion. . . . Thus out of sorrows common alike 
to North and South came this beautiful custom.” 
7 Order of General Logan, Commander-in-chief of the Grand 
Army, in 1868, for the observance of Memorial 
Day on May 30 of that year. 
8 Now a legal holiday in many States and observed in the 
South and. in States where it is not a legal holiday. 
9 Difference between Memorial Day and other holidays. 
(Holidays are not given us simply to have a good time; 
each one has a meaning and reason for its existence.) 
@ Memorial Day stands for more than honor to the dead 
soldiers; it stands for: First, Honor for patriotism, 
wherever shown; Second, For peace and union —a 
truly reunited country.

and South to-day. (Reunions between Union and

Suggestions for Making the Work About Memorial Day More 
Interesting 
The names of the States in the Union at the time of the Civil War 
may be written on the blackboard by the teacher. If this plan 
is used simply in school-room work, different children should 
choose States, which they wish to represent. Then each child 
writes or cuts out letters to form the name of his State. The names 
of the States are pinned upon the pupils; after this each pupil is 
called upon to tell whether his State seceded from the Union or 
not. Factsabout the Southern flag, army and generals are given by
-P-A-G-E-136
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 295 
those who wear the names of Southern States; in the same way 
the facts in regard to the Union side are described. After the 
lesson has been reviewed in this manner, the teacher has all the 
children put on something containing the colors red, white, and 
blue in order to show that all the States are reunited at the end 
of the war. 
Drawings or representations of the Southern as well as the 
Northern flag should be made either by the pupils or by the teacher. 
Soldier caps, some of them blue and some of them gray, with the 
proper symbols upon them, can be mad: from construction paper 
or light weight cardboard. These will add to the interest in the 
lessons, even if they are not used for Memorial Day exercises later. 
Bands of blue or gray cambric, with insignia of rank on them, can 
also be made. If the children wear these caps, they can act out 
scenes in the life of a soldier or special incidents in the Civil War.

Pictures 
Pictures of famous battlefields as they look to-day, and other 
pictures connected with the Civil War should be shown to the 
children. Pictures which will help them to realize the hard- 
ships of the life of a soldier should also be used. 
By means of pictures, of course the pupils will learn to dis- 
tinguish the leaders in the war, both those in the Northern 
and those in the Southern army. Pictures of monuments, 
which have been erected to the memory of the soldiers, 
or, if possible, visits to see these monuments will be of in- 
terest. 
It will be of special value in connection with the idea of a re- 
united country, which should be emphasized, to use illustra- 
tions showing the reunion of the blue and the gray at Gettys- 
burg. 
(Many of these were published at the time of the reunion.)

signed for the city of Fitzgerald, Georgia, emphasize the same 
idea.

Suggestions for Peace Day, May 18 
There are not very many facts connected with the establish- 
ment of Peace Day which would be of interest to children in the first 
four grades. While a few facts and stories may be used in the 
Third and Fourth Grades, it is betterin general to emphasize the 
same idea with small children in other ways and at other times. 
The material which was suggested to be used in April concerning 
heroes of peace will be valuable along this line. It is intended 
also that in all stories and work, which are connected with wars, 
the present friendly relations between the two parties to the 
quarrel should be emphasized. At all times the teacher should 
try to impress the children with the idea of how much more can be 
done for their town or city and their country in time of peace than 
in time of war. More in this direction can be accomplished in 
upper than in lower grades.

material which might be adapted to lower grades, but most of it 
is better for upper grades.) 
Suggestions for a Simple Exercise in the School-room for Peace Day 
The children might make representations of the flags of some 
of the most important nations. Then a child would represent 
each country and would carry or wear the flag of that country. 
Some child would also be chosen to represent the United States; 
this child might wear a band of red, white, and blue across the 
shoulder and a little red, white, and blue cap. 
Then the children could play the Welcome of the United States 
or America to the Nations. The chi'd representing the United 
States comes to the front of the room and sits or stands in the 
center. Then the representatives of the different nations enter, 
and are welcomed by our country. Each representative of a 
foreign nation may tell something interesting about the country 
from which he is supposed to have come or reply to the welcome 
in some way.

Then all the children join hands and the United States gives 
the following quotation from Holmes: 
All but her friendships the nation forgets! 
All but her friends and their welcome forgets! 
These are around her; but where are her foes? 
“Welcome!” still whisper the echoes around; 
“Welcome!” still trembles on Liberty’s bell! 
Next a child representing Peace comes forward, carrying a gar- 
land in which are lilies and roses. She gives the following quota- 
tion: 
Yours are the garlands of peace we entwine; 
Peace with her garlands of lily and rose! 
Welcome, once more, to the land of the free, 
Hushed is our strife, in the land of the free.

Each child in turn now goes and kneels before the queen. 
The queen strikes one little boy twice with her scepter, and 
two little girls she strikes once. She may say something to 
the other children — give them some command, or tell them 
the name of some character she wishes them to assume in the 
games or sports that are to follow. For example, she may say 
to one boy: “Robin Hood, bring in your band.” To another 
child: ‘Little daisy maiden,” etc. 
5 Crowning the May Queen. 
The curtain is lowered before this scene. Some of the boys 
put on green capes and caps; these may be made without much 
trouble from crépe paper or cambric. Some of these boys may 
wear plumes in their caps; the plumes are made from tissue 
paper. The little boy the queen touched twice with her scepter 
acts as page for her. He should wear a white cap with white 
plume and a white cape; these may be decorated with flowers, 
and he may carry a tall staff with a large paper flower on the 
top. The little girls who take part in this exercise are, of 
course, dressed in white all the time. The two girls whom the 
queen touched with her scepter are to act as her maids-cf- 
honor; they wear, one a pink and the other a blue cap. Other 
girls put on costumes to represent different flowers as daisy, 
lily, rose, buttercup, etc. Directions for making a daisy 
costume are given in The School Aris Book, Vol. TX.

and suggestions about flower costumes from crépe paper.

and flowers makes little children look pretty. Songs or some 
musical exercises should be given while the changes in costume 
are being made by the children. 
The curtain is raised. Children enter, scattering flowers. 
(These are the very smallest children.) The queen is seated 
on her throne, or is led to her throne. The page stands near, 
holding the wreath just above her head. The maids-of-honor 
stand one on either side of the throne. Other children, dressed 
in white, are grouped on both sides of the throne; they have 
little baskets or bags filled with flowers or flower petals. 
The page puts the wreath on the queen’s head. Then the 
two maids-of-honor come forward, kneel, and put garlands of 
violets or other festoons around her waist and shoulders. The 
other children dance forward and back, throwing their flowers 
or petals at the queen and singing a few lines of the May song 
or saying: 
“Hail, hail to the queen! 
Sweet queen of May! 
Bring flowers, bring flowers all, 
And shower the queen.” 
6 May-Day Dances and Games. 
(The queen’s throne is moved a little to one side of the 
stage, so that she can watch and direct the May-Day festivities. 
The May-pole is set up in the center of the stage and surrounded 
and decorated with vines and garlands of flowers. The hoops 
are on the pole and ribbons of different colors to match the 
children’s costumes, who are to take part in the dance, hang 
from the top of the pole.)

Little children come dancing in, six from either wing. 
‘They are dressed either in flower costumes, in paper dresses 
and caps to correspond with the ribbons hanging from the 
pole, or in some other pretty fashion. 
A little girl on one side matches in costume the little 
girl opposite her. The children take hold of the ribbons that 
match their costumes and dance around the pole, winding and 
unwinding the different colors, until finally the ribbons are all 
wound around the pole.

set up a target, which is decorated with green vines and branches. 
In the center of the target they hang a bouquet of violets, or 
other flowers. (Instead of another target, the May-pole may 
be used and the flowers hang on that.) 
Each little boy in green takes a bow and arrow, and shoots 
in turn at the target. If any boy succeeds in hitting the flowers 
so that they fall from the target, he is the victor; everyone 
cheers him; a little girl runs and picks up the flowers and brings 
them to the queen, who presents them to the boy who hit them. 
c Other games. 
The game with the hoops described before may be played, 
the children who danced the May-pole dance playing it and 
having soft balls to correspond with the colors of their costumes. 
The children stand six on each side of the pole and throw across 
the stage. (On the stage, of course, they must be careful how 
they throw the ball.) 
Another game that may be played is to have pegs set up 
on the stage, and have the children try to throw wreaths of 
flowers over them. The one who throws the wreath over 
every peg is crowned by the queen. 
III May-Day Drill. (For Second or Third Grade.) 
The children carry circles made of a number of wires or 
pieces of cane fastened together. These circles are wound with 
green paper; each circle has either a pink or yellow tulip or 
jonquil on it. (The flowers are made of crépe paper.) 
Children march on the stage, half from each wing, and ar- 
range themselves according to the number taking part in the 
drill. The children’s flowers should be of alternating colors; 
first line has pink, next yellow, and so on. 
Circle Drill 
Eight children in two rows, four in each row. (They form 
two squares.) 
Position — circle held in front, flower on top (both hands 
on circle). 
Swing circle to right and back — 1-2 
Repeat for ten or more counts.

If the May Queen remains on the stage during the drill, when 
the children reach her, they kneel and salute by bending their 
flower circles toward her. 
Other May-Day Customs that might be Illustrated 
The custom of the May-doll might be given. Very small chil- 
dren, carrying a doll in a small chair or hung in a hoop, dance upon 
the stage, singing: 
“The first of May is garland day, 
And chimney-sweepers’ dancing day; 
Curl your locks as I do mine, 
One before and one behind.” 
The doll, hoop or chair, and the little girls are all decorated with 
flowers and ribbons.
-P-A-G-E-147
306 HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
The poor children bringing the Mayflowers around to the differ- 
ent houses and singing their May songs might also be illustrated. 
The scene in an English home should be shown, with the fireplace 
in the background, some high-backed chairs, pictures, etc. Little 
children may be dressed to represent an English lord and lady, and 
seated on a platform or dais. The children who bring the flowers 
should be dressed in poor clothes. They may sing an Old Ballad, 
“The Kitchen May-Day Song.” The first stanza or two should 
be sung behind the wings be‘ore the children come into sight; the 
children then dance on the stage, continuing the singing; and offer 
their flowers to the master and mistress of the house. 
Tableaux might be shown also, illustrating the custom of hanging 
May baskets.

(Spring and Flower exercises: would do for any Spring Enter- 
tainment.) 
I Introduction 
(For the introduction select one or two of the following exercises.) 
1 Spring quotations. 
(Given by children wearing simple white dresses, with long, 
wing-like pieces of thin white material over the shoulders, 
and narrow light green ribbons or vines about the waist and 
on the shoulders. A little frilled band of light green or white 
is worn about the head and tied under the hair in back.) 
The children may give general quotations about Spring; or 
they may carry bunches of spring flowers and give quotations 
about the flowers, each one a quotation concerning the flower 
carried. If the spring quotations are used, they may carry 
green boughs. 
Poems from which quotations might be chosen: 
The Procession of Flowers, by Sydney Dobell. 
(Might be used for the quotations about flowers.)

Spring Song, by Paul Lawrence Dunbar. 
When Daffodils begin to Peer, by Shakespeare:

With, heigh! the doxy over the dale, 
Why, then comes in the sweet 0’ the year; 
For the red blood reigns in the winter’s pale. 
A Song of Waking, by Katharine Lee Bates. (First stanza.) 
2 An exercise with buttercups, daisies, and dandelions. 
Little children for this exercise are dressed in yellow and 
green, or white and green crépe paper. They carry bunches 
of the flowers, except the smallest ones, who carry the dandelions 
gone to seed. 
The smallest children come onto the stage first; part of 
them carrying the dandelion blossoms and part the flowers 
gone to seed. Those carrying the blossoms give the poem, 
“The Young Dandelion,” by Dinah Maria Mulock. Then the 
children having the seed dandelions give the poem: ‘The 
Dandelion,” by Katharine Pyle. They recite the following lines: 
I found a little old elfin man, 
His hair was white as snow; 
He only had one foot to stand, 
However the wind might blow. 
Now tell me, little old man, 
(Looking down at the dandelions) 
What is the time of day? 
(They b'ow the dandelions and say) 
“Tt’s two, four, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 
Eleven o’clock,” says he; 
And now his little old head is bald, 
As bald as it can be. 
After this, children a little larger than the first come on the 
stage, carrying great armfuls of buttercups and daisies. Five
-P-A-G-E-149
308 HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
of the children give a stanza each of the poem, ‘“Buttercups 
and Daisies,” by Mary Howitt. 
3 Exercise from “A Spring Song”? — author unknown. 
(The poem is given in “Days and Deeds,” compiled by 
Burton E. and Elizabeth B. Stevenson.) 
Old Mother Earth is seated on a mound covered with green; 
she is represented by one of the larger girls and has something 
wrapped around her so that it conceals her dress. 
Mother Earth 
Alas! Oh, where shall I get my new spring clothes? 
There’s not a place to buy a suit, 
And a dressmaker no one knows. 
After this, small children come in, one by one, and give 
the quotations appropriate to the grass and flowers, which are 
given in the poem. The first child has sprays of grass over her 
loose gown and carries grass, which she holds out toward Mother 
Earth. Dandelion, Forget-me-not, Violet, etc., wear appropri- 
ate colors and carry the flowers to Mother Earth. The last 
stanza of the poem may be read. 
4 The poem, ‘“Somebody’s Garden,’ by Margaret Steele 
Anderson. 
Very small children give this poem. Each child carries 
one of the flowers mentioned in the poem, and gives the part of 
the poem referring to that flower. The children are seated on 
the stage, which should be decorated with flowers and vines; 
they should recite the poem as if talking to each other. 
Song: “The Alder by the River,” by Celia Thaxter — Hermann 
Strachaver; “God is There’; ‘‘All the Birds have Come 
Again” (Volkslied). (Or some other Spring Song.) 
II Flower Legends and Stories 
The teacher selects from the flower legends already given 
under this month, or from other sources those which she pre- 
fers to use. 
Additional flower legends: 2 
The First Snowdrops. (This is good for the first legend.) 
How the Blossoms Came to the Heather. 
(These two are told in ““Book of Nature Myths,” by 
Florence Holbrook.)
-P-A-G-E-150
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION _ 309 
“The Flower Girl,” from an Algonquin Indian Story. 
(A poem, by Charles G. Leland, which refers to this 
legend is given in the St. Nicholas, Vol. XI, p. 695, 
July, 1884.) “The Castle of Gems,”’ in Little Prudy’s Fairy or Story 
Book, by Sophie May. (This is another story about 
the lily.) 
(Other Indian flower legends may be found in the references 
given under October.) 
These flower legends are illustrated by children dressed to 
represent the different flowers about which legends are given. 
(The teacher can plan these costumes from suggestions already 
made, or if she wishes simpler costumes, she can have the children 
wear white dresses decorated with festoons of the different 
flowers, artificial or real.) If the children who represent the 
flowers are from the Fourth Grade, they may give briefly the 
legends or stories. If smaller children are dressed to resemble 
the flowers, probably some older person would be needed to 
tell the legends, and the little children would come on the stage, 
one by one; each standing at the center front of the stage while 
the legend about his particular flower was told and then going 
to some position where all would make a pretty tableau at the 
end. 
For this exercise there might be a Queen of the Flowers, 
who would sit on a white or green throne. For the queen the 
little girl who wears the rose costume, or a Lily Queen, might be 
chosen. If there is a queen, the legends about her flower should 
be made especially prominent. The queen should carry a long 
staff with her flower on top of it. If a flower queen is on the 
stage, the other flower children salute her, when they enter, and 
say: The buttercup (or some other flower) salutes the beautiful 
rose (or lily), queen of the flowers. 
After the legends have been given, the flower children could 
give a little dance, drill, game, or song as preferred. 
(The children should carry wands with flowers on top to 
match their costumes, if they are to give a drill; and flowers to 
correspond with their costumes for the dance. The childrenimay 
scatter these flowers in the flower dance.) 
Songs: 
(Selections should also be made from flower songs, and these 
songs should be rendered between the legends in order 
to add variety.)

310 HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
The Daisy, by D. Batchellor. 
Little White Lily, by George MacDonald — Gertrude 
Walker. 
(Action may be used with this song.) 
Little Gypsy Dandelion — F. Remsen. 
The Red Rose, by Kate Forman —John Martin. 
Instead of having the children dressed as flowers, a few 
flower tableaux may be given to illustrate the legends. 
(Many suggestions for these tableaux might be given, but 
only a few will be mentioned, because there are so many which 
readily suggest themselves that it is impossible to give them all. 
Many pictures may be found which will help.) 
Rose tableaux 
Sub-Rosa — A very large artificial rose, or a branch of 
roses is suspended. — Under this two little girls are seated whis- 
pering. 
The Moss-rose — This may be illustrated by a little child, 
dressed as a fairy, sleeping under a rose bush; or by a taller 
girl or boy fairy standing near the rose bush, scattering some- 
thing over the plant. (An artificial rose bush could be used.) 
Torget-me-not 
A little boy, dressed in soldier or sailor costume, is saying 
farewell to a little girl and handing her a bunch of forget-me-nots. 
The little girl may be dressed in a light dress, made long and full. 
Lily 
The story by Sophie May might be illustrated by showing a 
fairy handing a beautiful lily to a rather tall girl. A little girl 
on a couch, with some one handing her a bunch of pond-lilies, 
would illustrate the origin of the water-lily. 
III The Flower War, or the War between Summer and Winter 
1 Preparing for battle. 
Across the stage, a little distance from each other, are ar- 
ranged two barricades or a kind of forts. These may be made by 
taking boxes and placing boards between them; then the whole 
is covered with some cheap green material or green paper. The 
green on one of the forts is covered with white and representa- 
tions of snow are placed on it; while the other fort is decorated 
with vines and flowers. Thus one of the forts represents Winter 
and the other Summer. They may be labeled by means of
-P-A-G-E-152
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION © 311 
appropriate flags, or in some other way. Winter should have 
baskets of artificial snowballs for ammunition, and summer 
should use baskets of flowers and green twigs. 
In this scene, preparing for, battle, the children who have 
charge of each fort come on the stage bringing their ammunition. 
They arrange the fort, collect and sort out the flowers, and place 
some of the ammunition on top of the fort. 
The children at the Summer Fort wear thin clothing, white 
for the girls; and those at the Winter Fort wear sweaters, 
caps or hoods, and mittens. 
  2 Battle from behind defences. 3 
The children hide behind the summer.fort, except that one 
or two very small ones peek out at the corfierof this fort. Sud- 
denly some one raises his head cautiously a little above the sum- 
mer fort and throws some flowers at some antagonist over at the 
other fort. If anyone is hit, he falls back. Five or six im- 
mediately pelt the audacious representative of summer; he 
dodges down behind the fort again, but others begin to show 
themselves, and carry on the war. Those at the winter fort 
are driven to hide behind their defences also. Thus the battle 
continues for a few minutes, anyone who shows himself at either 
fort being attacked from the other, that is, having either flowers 
or snowballs thrown at him or her. (If preferred, this battle 
may begin at what is supposed to be a later period in the spring, 
with winter behind defences also.) 
3 The Sally of Summer 
Part of those in the flower fort collect ammunition; and, 
with their arms as full as they can hold of flowers, they go out 
to attack the other fort. They go to both ends-of the fort 
and fight with their flowers, but are finally driven back, their 
ammunition exhausted. They go inside the fort to get more 
flowers. (This sally may be by winter, as a last attempt to 
retain control, ii preferred.) ode yy 
4 The Siege of Summer. 
With baskets and laps full of flowers, those representing 
Summer encamp around the other fort and give them no chance 
to escape. 
5 Fight and Victory. 
Winter attempts to escape, or Summer attacks Winter. 
They fight, but Winter has now only a little ammunition com-
-P-A-G-E-153

HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 313 
pared with Summer and it soon becomes exhausted. Then the 
children representing Summer go into the Winter Fort, some 
climb over the barricade and some enter at each end. They 
fight inside the fort and drive all those representing Winter from 
the stage. 
6 Return of the victorious army. 
After winter is driven from the stage, the children repre- 
senting summer come dancing and singing back. They take 
down the white covering from the winter fort, and under this, 
they find a green covering. Then they decorate this fort with 
vines and flowers to correspond with the othez. 
7 The Song of Victory. 
The children representing Summer come to the front of the 
stage and sing a song expressing joy at the triumph over Winter. 
“Farewell to Winter,”’ may be used. 
Song: “Stars and Flowers,” by Mary Stanhope. Arrangement 
by Schubert. 
(This song may be rendered as a conclusion. Some of the 
children should carry flowers, those which close at night, if 
possible, or they should wear wreaths of flowers and act sleepy 
themselves. Other children wear stars or carry long. staffs 
with stars on them.) 
An entertainment might be arranged with the flower legends 
and flower or spring songs alone, which would be interesting. 
There are legends about birds, butterflies, and small animals 
which might be used instead of the flower legends, or selections 
might be made from both. There are also some tree legends. 
Choose those, of course, which have some connection with the spring 
or summer time. A butterfly costume, a bumble bee, and a bird 
costume are shown in Dennison’s pamphlets, “Art and Decoration,” 
for 1912 and 1913. “The Story of the Bees and the Flies,” “The 
Story of the First Butterflies,” and “The First Humming-Bird,” 
may be used. A pretty entertainment could also be arranged by 
illustrating some Mother Goose rhymes or some old fairy stories.

EXERCISES THAT May BE USED FOR ENTERTAINMENTS IN 
ILLustRATION 
I Division and Reunion 
1 The Thirteen Original States 
Thirteen children march onto the stage. They may come 
somewhat according to the order of settlement, and arrange 
themselves as nearly as possible like the arrangement of the 
States on the map. Each child wears the name of one of the 
thirteen original States. Girls may be used for this part of the 
exercise as well as boys. The names of the States are cut from 
red paper and sewed on white bands which the children wear 
across their shoulders. In order to have the three colors of our 
country, the children also wear on their heads white bands with 
blue stars in front. (These bands may be used, in connection 
with the suggestions already made, for regular school-room work, 
after the story of Memorial Day or the Civil War has been told.) 
After the children representing the thirteen original States 
have come on the stage, a boy comes to the front carrying a flag 
made like the first flag adopted by our country. A quotation 
is given. One of the following could be used: 
Among the nations of the earth, 
What land hath story like our own? 
No thought of conquest marked her birth; 
No greed of power e’er was shown 
By those who crossed the ocean wild, 
That they might plant upon her sod 
A home for Peace and Virtue mild 
And altars rear to Freedom’s God. 
— Mary E. Vandyne 
A new nation, conceived in Liberty and dedicated to the 
proposition that all men are created equal. 
— Abraham Lincoln (Gettysburg Speech) 
If the second quotation is given, at the conclusion all raise 
their arms, pointing toward the flag, and say: 
“To its support, we pledge our lives, our fortunes, and our 
sacred honor.”

2 Growth of the Country. 
More children march onto the stage, bearing the names of 
additional States that were added to the Union. They arrange 
themselves in proper position on the stage. 
Quotation: “Westward the course of empire takes its 
way.” —Bishop Berkeley 
3 Division. 
The children representing Northern and Southern States 
separate a little on the stage, leaving an empty space between 
them. A boy in the center holds an American flag of later 
period. Another boy advances to the front beside the flag, and 
gives this quotation from Clay: “I have heard something about 
allegiance to the South. I know no South, no North, no East, 
no West, to which I owe any allegiance.” After this a boy comes 
to stand on the other side of the flag and says: “Our Federal 
Union: it must be preserved.’”’ (Jackson’s toast.) 
(A quotation from Lincoln’s ‘House divided” speech may 
be given instead of the quotations above.) 
4 Secession. 
The child bearing the name South Carolina now goes 
entirely away from the others. The first two stanzas of 
“Brother Jonathan’s Lament for Sister Caroline} by Oliver 
Wendell Holmes are recited. (The last stanza may be given 
also if desired.) After this, the other States that joined the 
Southern Confederacy (as far as they are represented on the 
stage) separate and range themselves with South Carolina. 
Patriotic songs of both North and South are sung. 
(Curtain) 
5 War 
The children are all boys for this scene, half of them repre- 
senting the North and half the South. These boys wear soldier 
caps and bands on the shoulders with insignia of rank on them, 
Southern wearing the gray and Northern the blue. They carry 
toy guns, swords or something to represent weapons. 
A military march is played; the boys in blue, carrying the 
Union flag, and the boys in gray, carrying the Confederate, enter 
from either wing and range themselves on opposite sides of the 
stage. (There is some open space left between the two forces.) 
A chord is struck on the piano and the boys turn, so that 
the Union and Confederate soldiers face each other. Three 
times the Union forces advance toward the Southern; both

sides take positions as if for battle, some kneeling, all aiming 
with their guns or other weapons; they hold this position for a 
moment; then the Union forces retire. There is music during 
this action. (When the boys are in position for a battle, at 
signals they may change and add other characteristic movements 
if desired.) 
Next the Southern forces invade the North and are driven 
back. The Northern troops again go to the Southern side of 
the stage and now they defeat and drive back the Confederate 
soldiers. The leaders advance to the front, and the Confederate 
leader surrenders his sword to the Union leader. 
If quotations are desired with the movements for this 
scene, the music may stop at certain points and the following 
might be used: 
A quotation from the ‘Voyage of the Good Ship Union,” 
by Oliver Wendell Holmes. (When the children have entered 
and are facing each other.) 
After the children representing the North have been driven 
back three times, and the Southern soldiers invade the North, 
this quotation: 
Now, men of the North! will you join in the strife 
For country, for freedom, for honor, for life? 
— The Last Charge, by Holmes 
At the end, the last stanza of ‘Voyage of the Good Ship 
Union.” 
Quotation from “To Arms,” by Parke Benjamin. 
6 Reunion. 
A march is played. A child brings the Union flag to the 
center front of the stage. Children, representing North and 
South, enter and arrange themselves on the stage, in a semi- 
circle, with clasped hands held high. (Instead of this arrange- 
ment, the children may form two lines down the center of the 
stage, Southern States on one side and Northern on the other; 
then the flag is borne to the front between the two lines and all 
salute it.) For this scene the children represent the most im- 
portant States in the Union at the time of the Civil War. The 
idea of renewed loyalty to the Union and the States represented 
may be shown in the same manner as for the thirteen original 
States in the first scene.

II “To Canaan,” by Oliver Wendell Holmes 
A band of boys, carrying drums, flags, swords, etc., and 
wearing soldier caps, march on the stage. They are followed 
by other boys made up as negroes, carrying spades, etc., and 
dressed in poor clothes or overalls. A boy stands at one side, 
just below the stage and questions the troop according to the 
poem. He gives the question in the first stanza: 
“Where are you going, soldiers, 
With banner, gun, and sword?” 
The leader of the troop answers: 
“We're marching South to Canaan, 
To battle for the Lord!” 
The next question and answer are given in the same way. 
In each case the whole band of soldier boys give the last four 
lines of the stanzas together. The answer about the flag in the 
second stanza should be given by the boy acting as standard 
bearer, who steps forward as he speaks. When the answer 
to the question in the third stanza is given, the leader turns 
and points to the negroes. The next two stanzas may be given 
in the same way if desired.

The bravest person in Fredericktown. 
(Adapted from the poem, “Barbara Frietchie,’’ by Whit-

Scenery 
The back of the stage, or of the part of the school-room which 
is to be used, should be shut off by screens or in some similar 
manner. In the center should be arranged a representation of a 
small window. This should be as high as possible. An opening 
between or above the screens may be used for the window, with 
pieces of wood arranged for the casement, and curtains on either 
side; or a window may be painted on canvas, the upper sash 
only being painted, the lower left as if open. The stage is 
decorated with as many flags as possible, flags above the screens 
and wherever they can be placed.

the screens and all around are taken down, until not one remains 
in sight. Then at the window above is seen a little girl, represent-

fastens out at the wndow. If desired, some conversation may 
take place be.ween Barbara Frietchie and the citizens.) 
Scene Il — Same place. Coming of the Confederate troops. 
(Boys, representing Southern troops, come marching across 
the stage; the Confederate flag is carried by one of the boys. The 
leader looks from side to side as they march; suddenly he sees the 
Union flag. He stops.) 
Stonewall Jackson “Halt!” (The soldiers stand still near 
the window.) “Fire!” (The boys point their guns at the flag; 
sounds to represent firing are given.) 
(While the pretended firing is going on, some one behind the 
screen unfastens the flag at the window, but as it is about to fall, 
Barbara Frietchie seizes it, and leans out at the window, waving 
it.)

again. During this time the last part of Whittier’s poem, from 
“All day long through Frederick street 
Sounded the tread of marching feet: ”

A Frac Day 
I Story of the Development of our First American Flag 
1 Flags used in the early history of our country. 
a Flag of the Pilgrims and other colonists who came from 
England to settle in this country: English flag. 
(Description, drawing, and picture, or a real English 
flag should be used.) 
6 History of flag of England. 
(The “Red Cross of St. George.” The “White 
Cross of St. Andrew.” ‘King’s colors.”) 
c Early flags of our country. 
(Pine Tree Flag, Rattlesnake Flag, Flag designed by 
Benjamin Franklin, etc.) 
The children may draw these flags, and later make flag 
booklets. 
2 Making the First Real Flag of our country. 
a Different flags the soldiers carried in the first battles of 
the Revolution. (Trouble to distinguish their own 
ships and men.) 
6 The Cambridge Flag. 
Designed by General Washington and Benjamin 
Franklin. 
First striped flag, but had a corner like the English 
flag which meant that they were unwilling to sepa- 
rate from the mother country, although they were 
united in defense of their rights.

d_ Declaration of Independence, July, 1776. 
Need of new flag for the new nation. 
e Visit of George Washington and Robert Morris to Betsy 
Ross. (Betsy Ross a skilful needlewoman.) 
Description of the Betsy Ross house in Philadelphia. 
(Show picture of the house.) 
f Washington’s plan of flag. 
Thirteen stripes, seven red and six white, with circle of 
thirteen stars on a blue field. 
g Betsy Ross’s five-pointed star. (How she made it.) 
h The sample flag and how it was made. 
Show children the arrangement of stars. 
i Adoption of flag by Congress, June 14, 1777. 
Voted by Congress, then meeting in Independence Hall, 
Philadelphia: “Resolved, that the flag of the thirteen 
United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and 
white; that the union be thirteen stars, white in a 
blue field, representing a new constellation.” 
j Reason for colors and design of flag. 
k First time the new flag was raised: At Fort Stanwix, 
August 6, 1777. (The making of this flag — material 
used.) 
1 First recognition of United States flag by a foreign coun- 
try. 
John Paul Jones reported that a salute of nine guns 
was given by the French in return for salutes from 
ship in his fleet on February 14, 1778. 
IT Changes in the Flag 
1 Admission of new States to the Union. 
a At first a stripe as well as a star added for each new State; 
reason why this did not work well. 
6 Decision to have thirteen stripes for the thirteen original 
States and a star for each State. Arrangement of stars 
to be in rows. 
c A star is added to the flag on the next Fourth of July 
after the admission of a new State to the Union. 
2 The flag to-day. 
Forty-eight stars, in six rows of eight stars each. 
(Teach the children to draw the flag exactly right in 
every respect.)
-P-A-G-E-168
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION © 327 
3 Proposal for new arrangement of stars. 
Design of Wayne Whipple, of Philadelphia: In the 
center thirteen stars arranged in the form of a six- 
pointed star; around these thirteen stars there is a 
circle of twenty-five stars, which represents the 
number of States admitted to the Union for one 
hundred years after the Declaration of Independence 
and also reminds us of the arrangement of stars 
in the first flag of the United States. The ten States 
~ which have been admitted since 1876 are represented 
by stars outside of the circle. This is a very 
pretty design and was approved of by President 
Taft. 
(Crowded condition of stars on flag at present. A 
drawing of this new design or of others that right 
be used may be made.) 
III Meaning and Treatment of the Flag 
1 Value of the flag. 
a Need of flags by different nations. 
b What the flag does for us: Protects us in foreign countries, 
etc. (Tell stories of how the flag helps people in their 
own country and in foreign countries.) 
c The flag represents our country. 
The importance of showing respect or courtesy to the 
flag. 
2 Meaning of different colors in the flag. 
3 Treatment of flag. 
a How it should be raised and lowered. 
(When at half-mast.) 
6b Meaning of different positions. 
c Nailing colors to the mast of a ship. 
(Meaning of “hauling down the colors.’’) 
d In the army and navy: A person who lowers or gives up 
the flag, without authority, to the enemy is punished 
with death. Even in time of battle the standard bearer 
must not allow the flag to touch the earth. The 
following story is told: A negro who carried the Stars 
and Stripes for the Tenth Cavalry at the Battle of San 
Juan Hill saw another standard-bearer fall wounded. 
He sprang to the dying man, seized the colors, and 
advanced to the front carrying both heavy battle flags. 
On account of this brave deed, he was promoted and 
commended by President McKinley.
-P-A-G-E-169
328 HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
e National salute to the flag: Salute of twenty-one guns to 
the flag on February 22, May 30, and July 4. 
f On board naval ships: Salute to the flag is to lift the 
cap toward the flag. All officers and men give the 
salute to the flag on reaching or leaving deck; they 
stand at attention whenever the “Star-Spangled 
Banner”’ is played. 
(Many persons, who are not in the army or navy, now 
stand up or uncover their heads as a sign of respect 
to this song: “The Star-Spangled Banner”’; also to 
“America” and to the flag.) 
g Color-guard by the flag in time of battle to see that it 
is not captured by the enemy. 
h Story of General Sherman: A cadet at West Point who 
belonged to the color-guard when General Sherman 
visited the place and reviewed the cadets, made the 
following statement: “When the general, passing 
down the line, came to the flag, he uncovered his head, 
bowed low, and his face wore an expression of deepest 
reverence. This act of veneration by the stern old 
soldier taught us cadets a lesson we can never forget.’ 
i “Morning and evening colors.” 
(When the flag is raised and lowered on board naval 
ships and at naval stations. Also at army posts.) 
Describe the ceremony in the navy: The bugle-calls, 
“standing by the colors,’ music, officers stand, face 
colors, remove caps, and remain silent. 
Describe the ceremony also at army posts. 
(The children should be shown pictures, which illus- 
trate “ Morning and Evening Colors,” and which will 
help to make impressive the feeling of the soldiers 
and sailors toward the flag and their respectful treat- 
ment of it. After this, the flag should be brought 
forward and held by some pupil, while the others 
give their salute to it.) 
j Dipping the colors to President in inaugural parade. 
(The President and those with him stand with un- 
covered heads.) 
k Courtesy between different nations: Salutes to the flag 
of a foreign country, when visiting a port of that coun- 
try. Sometimes when our ships are celebrating holi- 
days in a foreign port, foreign ships will also salute 
the flag by firing guns; in this case some officer always 
goes to thank them for honoring the flag. When one
-P-A-G-E-170
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 329 
of our warships is passed by another belonging to a 
foreign country, the officers salute the foreign flag. 
1 How boys should treat the United States flag. 
Tell the children any laws that have been passed in 
regard to the use of the flag. (For example, about 
its use for advertising purposes.) 
How boys should salute, if they visit any ships of war, 
or other special places where the flag is always dis- 
played. When there is a procession and the flag 
passes, or when a national air is played. (No matter 
what others do, they should never remain seated, or 
with their caps on, when “America” or “The Star- 
Spangled Banner” is played.) 
When using the flag in an entertainment, or for decora- 
tion, they should be very careful in regard to their 
treatment of it. 
(If the flag is displayed about the school, it would be 
well also to teach the boys to raise their caps in 
its honor.) 
IV Other Interesting Facts in Connection with the Flag 
I Different flags.

V “Old Glory” e Captain Stephen Driver. 
a Born at Salem, Massachusetts, March 17, 1803. 
6 Commander of ship, named ‘‘Charles Doggett.” 
c His friends gave him a large American flag in 1831, when 
he was about to sail from Salem. 
d He raised the flag over his ship, and named it “Old 
Glory.” 
e From that time, this flag was treasured by the captain, 
who always referred to it as “Old Glory.” 
f Captain went to live in Nashville, Tennessee, after he 
gave up going to sea. 
The Civil War. 
a Unsuccessful attempts of the Confederates in Nashville 
to find Captain Driver’s “Old Glory.” 
6 The flag was hidden inside a bed quilt, which the captain 
had helped to make and which he used every night 
on his bed. 
c When the Union forces gained control of the city, Cap- 
tain Driver brought out his flag, and it was raised 
over the Capitol. “ Now thatOld Glory is up theie,” 
said the captain, “I am ready to die.”
-P-A-G-E-172
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 331 
3 After the death of Captain Driver, “Old Glory” was sent 
back to Salem, Massachusetts, where it is carefully 
preserved. 
4 This is thought to be the story of how our flag was first 
named “Old Glory.”

VII Story of the Writing of the Song, “The Star-Spangled Ban- , 
ner,” by Francis Scott Key. 
1 Francis Scott Key. 
a Son of John Ross Key, an officer in the Revolution. 
6 Birth: In Maryland, August 9, 1780. 
c Became a lawyer; lived in Frederick, and then in Wash- 
ington. (Show pictures of his home.) 
2 The War with England, 1812 to 1814. 
a Cause of the war: Capture of American sailors and other 
trouble on the sea. 
b Toward the close of the war, capture of City of Washing- 
ton by the British forces, under General Ross. 
Destruction of many important buildings. 
c British forces preparing to attack Baltimore next. 
Fortification of Fort McHenry by Americans. 
d Capture of Dr. William Beanes by the British, after they 
left Washington. 
e Determination of Key, to visit the British fleet, and try 
to obtain the release of Dr. Beanes, who was a friend 
of his. (Letter to his mother, on September 2, 1814, 
telling her what he intended to do.) 
f Visit of Key and John S. Skinner under flag of truce to the 
British fleet at the mouth of the Potomac. (Explain 
the meaning of flag of truce.) 
g Refusal of British admiral to allow Dr. Beanes, Key, or 
his companion to return to Baltimore that night, 
although he promised that they should be released 
soon. The reason he would not allow them to go 
was that he was about to attack Fort McHenry. 
h The Americans placed on-board another ship, closely 
guarded. This ship was in sight of Fort McHenry 
when the British made their attack upon it.
-P-A-G-E-173
332 HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
i The British fleet bombarded the fort all night; anxiety 
of the Americans that night, when they heard the 
cannonade and could not know the result until dawn. 
At dawn (September 14, 1814), the ‘“‘old flag was 
still there.” 
3 Composing the song, “The Star-Spangled Banner.” 
a@ During the bombardment, while pacing the deck of the 
British vessel. 
6 First written on the back of a letter. 
c When Francis Key returned to Baltimore, the song was 
printed. 
d Popularity of song. (Sung everywhere.) 
(After the story, read to the children or have them sing 
the song.) 
4 The flag placed over Francis Scott Key’s grave at Freder- 
ick, Maryland. Monument to his memory. 
5 The flag which was “still flying” on Fort McHenry. 
a Made for Fort McHenry by the wife of Col. Henry 
Pickersgill of Baltimore. : 
6 Forty feet in length; had fifteen stripes, each about two 
feet broad; fifteen stars which were about two feet 
from point to point. 
c Celebrations in which the flag has played a part: Re- 
ception to General Lafayette in 1824, Centennial 
Exposition, one hundredth anniversary of the adop- 
tion of the national flag, celebration of the battle 
of Fort McHenry in 1880. 
6 September 14, 1914, the one hundredth anniversary of the 
composition of the song, ‘The Star-Spangled Banner,” 
was celebrated in Baltimore. 
School Salute to the Flag 
“T pledge allegiance to my flag and to the Republic for which 
it stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.” 
Additional Suggestions, which may be Found Helpful in Certain 
Schools 
It might be found valuable in some schools to have a morning 
ceremony, something like “morning colors.” Part of this cere- 
mony would be “receiving the colors” for the day; this means 
that some child would have charge of the flag each day and would 
stand beside the flagstaff, or would hold the flag, when any flag 
songs or flag salutes were given. The children should be taught 
to consider this as a great honor and no child who did not conduct
-P-A-G-E-174
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION — 333 
himself as a good citizen of the school, in regard to obedience to the 
rules, etc., should be allowed to hold the position. Thus this ex- 
ercise would help in teaching the children the meaning of good 
citizenship, and in the discipline of the school. A small flag in 
the school-room might be used for the ceremony, or the large 
flag, which flies over the school building, might be raised at the 
beginning of school and lowered at its close in the presence of 
the pupils, Remember that a very slight thing means a great 
deal to a child, if the teacher emphasizes it or presents it to him 
in the right way. If the flag is too large for a child to carry, to 
walk beside the one who carries it or to stand in a certain position 
while the flag is raised or lowered may be made to mean as much 
to the child to whom it has been given in charge for the day. 
Something along this line would be of special value in a rural 
school when there were older pupils as well as younger in the same 
building. 
Pictures, drawings, and small flags made by teacher or pupils 
should be provided for all important flags described in the 
work. 
Any good pictures showing the way to treat the flag and in- 
culcating reverence for it will also be helpful. 
Besides the United States flag to-day and representations of 
other flags used earlier in our history, flags might be designed 
and used which have a special significance for the schools or for 
special days. For example: flags for some of the holidays, which 
would be used in the exercises in celebration of the holidays and 
would have a special meaning to the children because planned by 
them; or flags illustrating certain points which the teacher wishes 
to emphasize with the pupils; or a flag of the school or for each 
room in the school. Thus the interest and the value of this flag 
work might be extended. 
(An article on “The Flag Significant,” by Henry T. Bailey, in 
School Arts Book, Vol. VII, February, 1907, may be found sug- 
gestive.) : 
The pupils should learn a few quotations about the flag and 
they should learn the words of the best national songs, as: 
“America,” ‘‘Hail Columbia,” “The Star-Spangled Banner,” and 
“Speed Our Republic,” by Keller.

b Between that time and July 4, 1776, opinion of many 
changed. 
c Some of the reasons for this change: The King of England 
had hired German soldiers to fight in America; he 
had refused to look at the last petition sent him by 
colonists. 
5 Richard Henry Lee, of Virginia. 
a Read first resolution saying that the American colonies 
were free from England. John Adams of Massa- 
chusetts seconded it. 
b How the people in England felt about, these leaders. 
c Story of Lee’s son, at school in England. 
Said that he was standing near one of his teachers one 
day, when a visitor asked: ‘What boy is that?”’ 
“He is the son of Richard Henry Lee of America,’ 
was the answer. The visitor put his hand on the 
boy’s head and said: ‘We shall yet see your father’s 
head upon Tower Hill.”” “You may have it when 
you can get it,” replied the boy. 
d It was not told at this time who proposed the resolu- 
tion. 
6 Declaration of Independence. 
a A committee of five men were chosen to write a paper, or 
Declaration, saying they were free from England 
and giving the reasons— called the Declaration 
of Independence. 
6 Thomas Jefferson wrote most of paper — Benjamin 
Franklin of Pennsylvania and John Adams of Massa- 
chusetts on committee. 
c Discussion as to whether this paper should be adopted 
or not. (Three days — July 2, 3 and 4.)

d Place where Jefferson wrote paper. 
‘A new brick house out in the fields, less than a quar- 
ter of a mile from Independence Square, where 
Jefferson had rented a parlor and bedroom, ready 
furnished, on the second floor, for thirty-five shill- 
ings a week.” The Declaration was written in the 
parlor, on a little writing desk, three inches high. 
He did not use any books in writing it.

1 Celebrated in every state of the Union. 
2 Methods of celebration. 
a The Floral Procession, which used to be held in Boston 
in celebration of July Fourth. 
The children marched two by two in the procession. 
The girls wore white dresses, decorated with flowers, 
and had wreaths of flowers on their heads. The 
boys wore white trousers, or, if possible, whole white 
suits, their hats and coats decorated with flowers also. 
In addition to this, each child carried a beautiful 
bunch or spray of flowers or a basket filled with 
flowers. In the procession there were many bands, 
banners, flags, etc. After the children had marched

through the streets of Boston, where many persons 
had come from other places to see the procession, 
they reached the Common. There tents had been 
erected, in which refreshments of ginger-cakes, 
lemonade, and ice-cream were sold. Amusements 
were provided also and the children could have a 
happy time all day.

IV Song: “Out on the Breeze.” (Second Grade Pupils.) 
V Exercise Showing the Development of the United States Flag 
Six flags are used for this exercise; they are brought upon 
the stage and shown to the audience by second grade pupils; as 
each flag is shown, a statement about that flag is read by 
some one. 
Statements about the flags. (To be read.) 
First Flag 
This flag, the “Red Cross of St. George,” was England’s 
flag for over two hundred and fifty years. It was planted at 
Labrador by Sebastian Cabot in 1497, and thus was the first 
flag to float over North American soil. 
Second Flag 
In 1606, Scotland was added to England, and ‘King James 
I. placed the diagonal “White Cross of St. Andrew” on the 
national flag, changing the field from white to blue. This 
union of the two crosses was called the ‘‘ King’s colors,” and the 
first permanent settlements in this country were made under its 
protection. It was the flag of the Mayflower in 1620. 
Third Flag 
The “Pine Tree Flag,” was used in this country from 1707 
to 1776. All the pictures of New England flags from 1707 to 
1776 show a design something like this one, and this flag was 
often used by our ships during these years. 
Fourth Flag 
First Flag of American Independence. It was raised with 
a salute of thirteen guns at Washington’s headquarters in 
Cambridge, Massachusetts, January 1, 1776. 
Fifth Flag 
The First Flag of the American Republic. It was adopted 
as the flag of our country by Congress in Philadephia, June 14, 
1777. The thirteen stars and thirteen stripes stand for the 
thirteen original States. 
Sixth Flag 
This flag is the first flag to show the growth of our country. 
In 1792 we had fifteen States instead of thirteen as at the time 
when Washington became president. For this reason Congress 
increased the number of stars and stripes to fifteen, and we 
used the fifteen-striped flag for twenty-three years.

‘The Flag tells us that no one in America is alone or friendless. 
There is a mighty government, with its laws and its officers, 
that will not let any one be oppressed. The flag is the 
sign of our pledge to befriend one another. 
— Charles F. Dole 
Sixth Boy 
Tf we journey to other countries, the flag tells us that our 
country will protect and care for us. No one will dare to 
harm us. 
Seventh Boy 
Bid it wave, to shame the wrong; 
To inspire mankind 
With a larger human love; 
With a truth as true 
As the heaven that broods above 
Its deep field of blue. 
In the gathering hosts of hope, 
In the march of man, 
Open for it place and scope, 
Bid it lead the van. — Lucy Larcom 
All go up to a large flag or point to one and say: 
We will stand by our country. 
We will try to be true citizens. 
We promise to do our work so well that the whole country 
will become richer and happier. 
We will live useful lives so that the children hereafter will 
have a nobler-eountry to live in than we have had. 
The Flag says: Do not be idle, or false, or dishonest... Try to 
make America the happiest land in the world.

JULY FOURTH 
TABLEAUX AND EXERCISES IN ILLUSTRATION 
To Give Lire AND ATMOSPHERE TO THE STORIES 
(In a little simpler form some of these exercises might be used 
in regular school-room work. Some exercises, which would be 
appropriate for July Fourth also, have been given under other 
special days.) 
I Quotation from “July,” by Frank Dempster Sherman. 
(Given in the St. Nicholas, July, 1887.) 
“July — for you the songs are sung 
By birds the leafy trees among; 
July — for you, in silence deep 
‘The world seems fallen fast asleep, 
Save on one glorious holiday, 
When all our books we put away 
And every little maid and man 
Is proud to be American!” 
(A white banner, with a blue border, and the word July or 
July Fourth in red letters on it, may be made. Then a pro- 
cession of small children, dressed in white and wearing either 
red or blue sashes or other decorations, may march onto the 
stage. The child in the center carries the banner or a flag, 
and gives the quotation.) 
II A New Nation 
Little children carry emblems or articles suggestive of the 
new nation, and give short statements or quotations concerning 
them. The following are among those which might be used: 
1 Name of the New Nation: United States of America. 
The words may be placed on a banner, or on along, narrow 
strip of cloth. The child carrying the name enters first and 
stands in the center; or the name may be held by two or three 
children or draped about them when the curtain is raised. The 
other children who bring emblems arrange themselves on either 
side of the central name.

2 Liberty Bell. 
A picture, drawn on a large sheet of cardboard or a repre- 
sentation of the bell cut from cardboard and appropriately 
decorated, is carried by a child, who gives the motto on the bell. 
3 The flag of the new nation. 
4 Coat-of-arms of United States. 
5 The motto of the United States. 
(Representations of the last three may be made. The 
shield alone may be used instead of the whole coat-of-arms if 
desired. If these emblems are used either in regular school- 
room work or in an entertainment, the children should have been 
taught their meaning.) 
IIT The Children’s Fourth of July 
1 “My Dog and I.” (Tableau and quotation.) 
A boy is seated on the stage, with his arm around a dog 
lying by his side. Fire-crackers and other things suggestive 
of the Fourth should be near the boy. 
The boy gives the following quotation: 
“Thanksgiving is all well enough in its way, 
Against Christmas and New Year I’ve nothing to say, 
But my dog and the fellows and I— 
That is, all the fellows who have any spunk, 
Who save up for months to buy powder and punk, 
And keep fire-crackers hid in my old leather trunk,— 
We just live for the Fourth of July!” 
2 The Little General. (Tableau.) 
A very small child is seated in a large chair; he wears a 
soldier hat, and carries a sword. 
(This tableau may be entitled “My General”; in that case 
a woman should be leaning over the back of the chair looking 
down at the little boy. Or ‘‘The Sleeping General” may be 
shown. To illustrate this title, the child should be leaning 
over to one side, with eyes closed, and the soldier hat fallen 
partly or entirely off.) 
3 The dolly I love best. (Tableau.) 
A very small child is hugging a very large firecracker. 
The fire-cracker would have to be made in order to be large 
enough.
-P-A-G-E-196
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION — 355 
4 Fourth of July Procession. 
(If desired, announcement of the procession may be given 
first by a child who rides across the stage on a bicycle, blowing 
a horn. This child might wear a white cape, decorated with 
some appropriate design in red and blue, and a cap. Instead 
of riding a bicycle, of course the child might walk to the front 
of the stage and give the announcement.) 
The procession is composed of small children, wearing soldier 
caps of red, white, or blue — just the common ones that children 
make out of paper will do, or a little better ones may be made 
from light cardboard or construction paper. Plumes made of 
tissue paper should be put on some of the soldier hats. Some of 
the children have drums, horns, and other musical instruments 
which they are using; others carry large flags, swords, and toy 
guns. Additional humorous features may be introduced into 
the procession, as shoulder knots of red, white and blue, boys 
drumming on tin pans, brooms upside down, etc. 
Instead of the above, Fourth of July Night, or The Evening 
Brigade may be given. Not as many children are needed for 
this. They wear the soldier caps; one has a drum, one a flag, 
one a horn of paper, and one or two carry candles. They are 
oo as if going to bed. (Picture in the St. Nicholas, July, 
1881. 
A quotation may be given from Eugene Field’s poem: 
“With Trumpet and Drum.” 
5 A great celebration. (Tableau.) 
A few children are made up to represent negroes. They 
are in poor clothes. our or five of these children are seated in 
a group, all looking excitedly toward a little larger negro, who 
stands in front of them, gesticulating eagerly. This larger 
negro boy says to the others: ‘Ef I wuz to invite you all to 
’sist me, we cud perduce a Fourth o’ July cel’brashun sech as 
wuz nevah seen befo’!” 
(Suggested by a picture, which illustrated a story in an old 
St. Nicholas.) 
6 “A Fourth of July Record,” by Lillian Dynevor Rice. 
Ten little children march to the front of the stage or the 
school-room. Each one carries a very large figure — from 1 to 
9 inclusive—with the last boy carrying a 0 (naught). They 
give the lines of the poem corresponding to their figures.

IV Three scenes with the Liberty Bell : 
(“The Liberty Bell,” by Elbridge S. Brooks, illustrated.) 
1 Children, wearing gray suits and Quaker hats, or if girls, 
Quaker caps and kerchiefs, stand in expectant attitudes 
on the stage. Screens are arranged so as to shut off the 
back of the stage; on the center one the words, “Inde- 
pendence Hall,” in large letters may be placed. A little 
boy runs onto the stage, and stands with his hand raised, 
pointing upward and back toward the hall. The quota- 
tions for this and the following scenes are taken from 
the poem, “The Liberty Bell,” by Brooks. 
The boy says: 
“Ring! the deed is done! 
Ring! they’ve signed, and freedom’s won!” 
The ringing of the bell is imitated by music or given be- 
hind the screens. 
Then a little girl dressed in white, with a red sash and red 
bell hat, comes on the stage and says: 
“Man is man — a slave n6 longer; 
Truth and Right than Might are stronger. 
Praise to God! We’re free; we’re free!” 
(The Quaker hats can be made from construction paper.) 
2 A large drawing of the Liberty Bell is placed in the center 
background of the stage for this scene; it may be hung on 
the screens or wall. Some children are grouped around it, 
looking at it; and an older person is pointing to it and seems 
to be telling the children about it. 
The child who gave the quotation for the first scene 
stands at one side of the stage, a little in front of the group. 
After this tableau has been looked at a moment, another 
little girl comes to the center of the stage; this little girl” 
is dressed in white, but she has a blue sash and blue bell hat. She gives the following quotation: 
“And the children, thronging near, 
Yet again the story hear 
Of the bell that rang the message, pealing out to land and sea: 
‘Man is man —a slave no longer; 
Truth and Right than Might are stronger. 
Praise to God! We're free; we’re free!’ ”

3 Tableau in the center of the stage, just a little back: Two 
boys dressed to represent a blue and a gray soldier boy, 
standing with clasped hands raised high and holding be- 
tween them a flag. A boy, made up as a negro, is kneeling 
near; the boy in blue is giving his other hand to this 
negro boy and lifting him up. The little girls who gave 
the quotations for the other scenes stand a little in front of 
this tableau, one on the right and the other on the left. 
A little girl, all in white — her bell cap and sash of white 
also — comes to the center of the stage and gives the quo- 
tation for this scene: 
“Though voiceless, still the Bell 
Shall its glorious message tell, 
Pealing loud o’er all the Nation, lake to gulf and sea to sea: 
“Man is man —a slave no longer; 
Truth and Right than Might are stronger. 
Praise to God! We’re free; we’re free!’”

It is of great benefit to tell the children in the first four grades 
a few stories in general history as well as to take the work in con- 
nection with American history and the chief holidays of the year. 
The stories should be selected with care and with a definite plan 
and object in mind. 
The plan ‘is to arrange the work in general history so that the 
children will have some knowledge of the nations of ancient times, 
which have most influenced the civilization of to-day. To tell 
many stories, selected at random and without any connection, 
is confusing to the child and fails to give any preparation for 
the gradual understanding of the unity of history, and the growth 
and development in the life of man. As a basis for the choice of 
history work and stories we would suggest that the teacher con- 
sider the following points in the order in which they are given: 
First, the interest of the child; second, the value at the present 
time in training the child toward good citizenship; third, his- 
torical importance. In selecting stories which will help to develop 
good citizens, we would weigh the question whether the story 
emphasizes some element, as obedience to law, perseverance, 
loyalty, etc., which is needed in the character of a good citizen 
to-day. By historical importance, is intended all that goes to 
make the absolute value of the story in the eyes of the best judges. 
Under this point, we would consider, then, the importance in the 
history of the world of the people with whom the work or story 
is connected, the importance of the event about which the story 
tells, the historical knowledge which may be gained, and also 
whether the knowledge of that story will be necessary later in 
understanding history and literature. 
Some of the benefits which the children ‘may derive from the 
work in general history are the following: 
The child’s interests and outlook upon the world are broadened. 
His historical vocabulary and knowledge are greatly increased; 
and he is much better prepared for the history work in the upper 
grades. It is surprising how much children can learn from stories, 
if they are tvid in a simple, interesting manner.

862 HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 
The child learns from this work that people have lived under 
very differcnt conditions from the present. He should be taught 
to take a sympathetic attitude toward these people, and ta im- 
agine himself under the same surroundings. In this way, sym- 
pathy and imagination are developed; these are two of the most 
important elements in the right appreciation of history. 
Some of the stories connected with the history of Greece and 
Rome are among the best which can be found to use in the train- 
ing for good citizenship along the lines already mentioned. They 
are also very good for reproduction work and thus help to develop 
the power of expression. Some of these stories may be acted 
successfully. 
These stories and talks with the children about the people 
of different countries and their customs will be found of great 
help when the teacher wishes the children to take part in exercises 
and perhaps imagine that they represent different nationalities. 
SUGGESTIONS FOR ARRANGEMENT OF STORIES IN THE GENERAL 
History Work 
It is suggested that the teacher may find the following work 
of value as a basis for general history in the first four grades: 
I The Life of Pre-Historic Peoples 
Cave-dwellers, Lake-dwellers, and Indians. 
(In the First and Second Grades, the teacher would consider 
with the children chiefly the life of the Indians. Then 
in the Third and Fourth Grades, she might connect the 
Cave-dwellers and Lake-dwellers with the Indians; and 
lead the children to see that long ago all people lived 
under these primitive conditions.) 
The following topics might be taken about primitive man: 
1 Surroundings — Forests, swamps, plants, animals. 
2 Homes — Caves, houses over lakes, tents. 
3 Life and occupations — Defence against animals, hunting 
and fishing, care of flocks and herds, primitive farming. 
4 Food and clothing — Fish and flesh of animals, fruits and 
berries. Skins of animals for clothing. 
5 Weapons of stone; bow and arrow. (How these weapons 
were made.) 
6 Important points in the advancement of man. § 
@ Use of fire. (How it was produced in these early times.) 
b Pottery. (Study of how the first dishes were made.) 
c¢ Invention of boats. (Study how the first boats were made.)

HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION 363 
In order to make this work of most value: to the pupils, the 
teacher should lead them to imagine themselves living as these 
early people were and then have them try to work out the problems, 
in regard to homes, food, clothing, etc., which these early people 
had to work out. Through play, also, the children must recreate 
as far as possible, the atmosphere appropriate to the period. To 
aid the child’s imagination in this work, the teacher should give 
good descriptions. If possible, the children should be taken 
outdoors for the consideration of some of these topics. They 
should be taught to notice the different shapes of stones and for 
what purposes they would be valuable. Some of the different 
kinds of wood and their uses may also be noticed.

III Greek History Stories 
(Third and Fourth Grades.) 
1 Grecian Myths. 
Europa; Cadmus; Theseus; Hercules; the story of the 
Golden Fleece; and the Trojan War. 
(These stories may be told in the Third Grade and re- 
viewed in the Fourth; or part of them may be taken 
in the Third and part in the Fourth Grade. Perhaps 
the children can read some of these myths for them- 
selves.)

a Country of Greece. (A little diagram or map interests 
the children.) 
6 Description of Athens and Sparta.

4 Story of the life of Alexander the Great. 
(Either Third or Fourth Grade.) 
While the children in the Third and Fourth Grades can under- 
stand and enjoy much of the history connected with these stories 
it will be only when special care is taken in selecting the points of 
interest to the children and in telling the story. The topics here 
indicated are to be used only as suggestions. ‘The children as well 
as the stories should be carefully studied. The teacher should 
endeavor to make these stories of long ago real to the pupils and to 
have them take something from each story of permanent value. 
The methods and plans for the work should be varied at different
-P-A-G-E-204
HISTORY IN STORY, SONG AND ACTION _ 365 
times, until the best plan is found. Begin with that which is 
familiar to the children, let them act out the stories when possible, 
plan to keep the imagination active, and to make the children think. 
If the teacher will keep the matter in mind, everything which comes 
to hand will suggest ways of increasing the interest. Special care 
should be taken to impress those facts and principles in Greek and 
Roman history which are of value in the making of character, as 
the Greek love of beauty and the Roman love of country. The 
work should be carefully reviewed by means of questions, familiar 
conversations, and reproductions, until the teacher is sure the 
children have mastered the essential points.

Then out spoke brave Horatius, the captain of the gate: 
“To every man upon this earth, death cometh soon or late. 
And how can man die better than facing fearful odds, 
For the ashes of his fathers and the temples of his gods? 
Hew down the bridge, sir consul, with all the speed ye may; 
I, with two more to help me, will hold the foe in play. 
In yon straight path a thousand may well be stopped by three. 
Now who will stand on either hand, and keep the bridge with 
me?”

LOCAL HISTORY 
History of the town or city in which the school is situated. 
Visits to places of interest connected with this early history. 
Stories of the first settlers of the place, their homes, etc. 
Object 
The object of this work is to show the children how history is 
made; that is, how we discover the facts of history in the records 
that we have of what has happened in the past. Also to 
connect what should be most familiar and interesting to 
them with their other history, and to increase their interest 
and knowledge of affairs in their own community in order to 
develop a better civic spirit. 
Method 
This work must be carefully done in order to be of any value. 
Some points in local history may be taken in the Fourth or 
Fifth Grades. The children should be encouraged to find out 
as much as possible for themselves. The teacher should 
tell stories connected with the early history of the place. 
Many pictures and articles illustrating life in the early days 
should be shown. Places of historic interest, any tablets 
which have been erected to mark special points in the town 
or city, etc., should be visited and studied.

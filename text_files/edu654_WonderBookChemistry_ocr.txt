TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE 
‘‘What is the use of a book without pictures or 
conversations?’’ asks Alice, disgustedly, just before 
taking her departure for Wonderland, where she 
finds no lack of animated discourse. 
This book, like its predecessors in the series, is 
conversational in form and has as many pictures as 
the subject-matter calls for. 
All boys and some girls, as well as their elders, 
take more or less interest in the marvels of chem- 
istry. To give an elementary but useful knowledge 
of these marvels, chiefly by means of simple experi- 
ments clearly described by the writer and easily per- 
formed at home by any wide-awake young reader, is 
the object of the following talks by ‘‘Uncle Paul.’’ 
The personal, biographical interest of the book is 
not to be overlooked. The boys Jules and Emile are 
the author’s own children, faithfully portrayed even 
to the names they bear. In his captivating fashion 
the man of vast learning makes himself at once 
teacher and comrade to his young hearers, and we 
learn that ‘‘his chemistry lessons especially had a 
great success. With apparatus of his own devising 
and of the simplest kind he could perform a host of 
elementary experiments, the apparatus as a rule 
consisting of the most ordinary materials, such as 
a common flask or bottle, an old mustard-pot, a
-P-A-G-E-6
  TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE 
tumbler, a goose-quill or a pipe-stem. A series of 
astonishing phenomena amazed their wondering 
eyes. He made them see, touch, taste, handle, and 
smell, and always ‘the hand assisted the word,’ al- 
ways ‘the example accompanied the precept,’ for no 
one more fully valued the profound maxim, so neg- 
lected and misunderstood, that ‘to see is to know.’ ”’ 
Though living creatures necessarily claimed the nat- 
uralist’s first affections, he none the less ‘‘animates 
even the simple elementary bodies, celebrating the 
marvelous activities of the air, the violence of chlo- 
rin, the metamorphoses of carbon, the miraculous 
bridals of phosphorus, and the ‘splendors which ac- 
company the birth of a drop of water.’ ”’ 
Concerning the eager young pupils, Jules and 
Emile, by this time well known to all readers of the 
series, a still further word may not be out of place. 
Emile, the younger, the ‘‘giddy-pate’”’ of the nar- 
rative, impulsive and full of boyish curiosity and 
vigorous young life, is drawn for us with fidelity and 
a delightful touch of humor by the loving father. 
Jules is shown to us as more sedate and gifted with 
finer qualities, and with his grief-stricken par- 
ent we mourn his early death. ‘‘He was a youth of 
great promise, ‘all fire, all flame’; of a serious na- 
ture; an exquisite being, of a precocious intelligence, 
whose rare aptitudes both for science and literature 
were truly extraordinary. Such too was the sub- 
tlety of his senses that by handling no matter what 
plant, with his eyes closed, he could recognize and 
define it merely by the sense of touch. This de-  
-P-A-G-E-7
  TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE 
lightful companion of his father’s studies had 
scarcely passed his fifteenth year when death re- 
moved him. A terrible void was left in his heart, 
which was never filled. Thirty years later the least 
allusion to this child, however tactful, which recalled 
this dear memory to his mind, would wring his heart, 
and his whole body would be shaken by his sobs.’’ * 
In a memorial foreword to the second volume of his 
‘‘Souvenirs Entomologiques’’ the bereaved father 
pays loving tribute to this lost son and fellow- 
worker. 
Thus it is that the following chapters will be found 
to have a human and personal appeal to supplement 
their scientific interest. May they yield both pleas- 
ure and profit to their readers!

OF CHEMISTRY 
CHAPTER I 
INTRODUCTION 
NCLE PAUL is a man of some learning who 
waters his lettuce-plants and weeds his 
cabbages and turnips in the quiet of a humble 
little village. Staying with him are his nephews, 
Emile and Jules, young scholars already grappling 
with the intricacies of the rule of three and the pit- 
falls of the past participle, and both of them very 
eager to learn. Jules, the elder, is even now be- 
ginning to suspect that school will not have taught 
him everything when he has mastered his grammar 
and arithmetic. Their uncle does his best to en- 
courage the boys’ desire for knowledge, convinced 
as he is that in the stern battle of life our best 
weapon is a trained intellect. 
For some time past his family had noticed in him 
an unusual preoccupation. There was ripening in 
his mind a plan for teaching his nephews the rudi- 
ments of chemistry, that science so fruitful in its 
practical applications. 
‘What are these dear children going to be, some 
day?’’ he asked himself. ‘‘Will they be manu- 
facturers, artisans, mechanics, farm laborers, or 
3

what? Who knows? One thing, at any rate, is 
certain, and that is, whatever direction their activ- 
ity takes it will be to their advantage to be able to 
give an account of the things they have accom- 
plished. A little science is something that they 
must have. I should like my nephews to know what 
air is, and water; why we breathe, and why wood 
burns; the nutritive elements essential to plant life, 
and the constituents of the soil. And it is no vague 
and imperfect knowledge from hearsay I would have 
them gain of these fundamental truths,.on which 
depend agriculture and the industrial arts and our 
health itself; I would have them know these things 
thoroughly from their own observation and experi- 
ence. Books here are insufficient, and can serve 
merely as aids to scientific experiment. But how 
shall we manage it?’’ 
In this wise did Uncle Paul ponder over his pro- 
ject, a project involving grave difficulties, such as 
the want of a laboratory and of all those ingenious 
devices without which it would at first seem im- 
possible to undertake any serious experiments in 
chemistry, the only appliances at hand being the 
commonest of household utensils,—bottles and 
phials, jars and pitchers, plates and cups and 
earthen bowls, drinking-glasses and old mustard- 
pots. It is true the distance to town was not great. 
For special occasions, but within the very modest 
limits set by an imperative economy, a few drugs 
and glass implements might be bought. Ten francs 
must be made to cover these extraordinary pur- 
chases. How, then, to impart some useful knowl-
-P-A-G-E-15

edge of chemistry with the help of little more than 
such simple appliances as the village could furnish 
—that was the problem. 
But in the end it came about that one day Uncle 
Paul announced to his nephews that he proposed to 
enliven the monotony of their regular studies by in- 
troducing a little diversion. Without using the 
word ‘‘chemistry,’’ which would have meant nothing 
to them, he spoke of certain interesting things he 
had to show them, of various wonderful experiments 
to be performed. Lively and curious, as are all 
children, Emile and Jules greeted this announce- 
ment with enthusiasm. 
‘‘When shall we begin?’’ they asked. ‘‘To- 
morrow—to-day?’’ 
‘To-day, very soon. Give me five minutes for my 
preparations. ’’
-P-A-G-E-16
CHAPTER II 
MIXING AND COMBINING 
O sooner said than done. Uncle Paul went 
to his neighbor the locksmith and from 
among the files on the artisan’s work-bench selected 
something and wrapped it up in a piece of paper. 
Then he visited the apothecary and for a few cents 
bought a drug which he also wrapped in a bit of old 
newspaper, after which he returned home with his 
two packages. 
‘‘What is this?’’ he asked, opening one of the par- 
cels before the children. 
‘‘It is a yellow powder that makes a little crack- 
_ ling sound when you rub it between your fingers,’’ 
replied Hmile. ‘‘I think it must be sulphur.’’ 
‘‘And I,’’? added Jules, ‘‘am sure it is sulphur. 
But we ’ll soon see.”’ 
So saying he took a pinch of the yellow powder 
and dropped it on some live coals from the kitchen 
fire, whereupon it began to burn with the blue flame 
and the suffocating odor of a sulphur match. 
‘That proves it, I hope,’’ cried the lad, much 
pleased with himself at having found a quick way to 
demonstrate the nature of the substance offered by 
his uncle. ‘‘It is sulphur and nothing else, for that 
6 
 
-P-A-G-E-17
MIXING AND COMBINING 7 
is the only thing that burns with that blue flame and 
that smell that makes you cough.”’ 
‘‘Yes, my boys,’’ assented their uncle, ‘‘it is sul- 
phur powdered very fine and called flowers of 
sulphur. And now what is this?’’ 
He opened the second package and displayed its 
contents, consisting of a powdered metal, the fact 
of its being a metal showing clearly in its glittering 
particles. 
‘‘That looks very much like iron filings,’’ declared 
the younger of the two observers. 
‘‘Tt does more than look like them,’’ asserted the 
other; ‘‘it really is iron filings. Uncle Paul, you 
must have got them from the locksmith’s.’’ 
‘‘Though I must congratulate Jules on his clever- 
ness and quickness,’’ rejoined Uncle Paul, ‘‘I ought 
at the same time to warn him against jumping to 
conclusions. In the studies we are about to take up 
together it is best to exercise careful scrutiny be- 
fore venturing on any assertions, as otherwise one 
would run the risk of making frequent mistakes. 
You say these metallic particles are iron filings; but 
lead filings, tin filings, zine filings, iron filings—all 
are of very much the same appearance, being all 
light in color and having a bright luster. You de- 
clared the yellow powder to be sulphur after you 
had proved it by dropping a pinch on burning coals. 
Now find an equally decisive proof that these filings 
are of iron.’’ 
The boys put on their thinking-caps and looked at 
each other in mutual questioning, but no happy 
   
-P-A-G-E-18
  8 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
thought came at their bidding. To what test could 
they put those filings to prove that they were indeed 
of iron? It was a puzzling problem, that was cer- 
tain. But at last Uncle Paul started the boys on the 
right track. 
‘‘How about the magnet,’’ said he, ‘‘that horse- 
shoe shaped piece of iron bought by Jules at the last 
fair and added to his little cabinet of apparatus for 
making experiments in physics? Wouldn’t it be 
just the thing to help you out in your present per- 
plexity? Many a time I ’ve seen you amusing your- 
selves with that magnet by making it draw to itself 
bits of iron, nails, needles. Does it_have the same 
effect on lead?’’ ; 
‘‘No,’’ replied Jules; ‘‘I have never been able to 
make it take up the least little bit of lead, though it 
will lift much heavier weights of iron,—a key, for 
example.’’ 
_> ‘Does it attract tin?’’ 
‘“No; no more than lead.’’ 
‘‘And zine and copper—does it have any effect on 
them?’’ 
‘‘No more than on lead or tin. Ah! NowTI have 
it. The magnet attracts only iron. That ’s the test 
we ’re after. Now we ’Il see.”’ 
Thereupon Jules ran upstairs, two steps at a time, 
and hastened to his cupboard where, on a pine shelf, 
were arranged his books and his little pieces of 
apparatus,—simple appliances and mostly of his 
own make. EHagerly catching up his magnet, he ran 
downstairs and brought it almost in contact with the 
filings. Immediately there were clusters of them
-P-A-G-E-19
MIXING AND COMBINING 9 
clinging to the two ends of the magnet, forming long 
beards of bristling appearance. 
‘‘See there,’’ cried the lad, ‘‘how it makes the fil- 
ings come to it! Iam sure now they are iron, noth- 
ing but iron.”’ 
‘*Yes, my boy, they are iron,’’ assented his uncle; 
‘and it was the locksmith’s work-bench that fur- 
nished me with the filings. Now, with this iron and 
this sulphur, which we have just proved to be iron 
and sulphur beyond any doubt, we will enter upon 
our study of chemistry. Give your attention to 
what I am about to do.’’ 
So saying, he emptied on a large sheet of paper 
both the flowers of sulphur and the iron filings, after 
which he mixed them thoroughly together by shak- 
ing the paper like a sieve and stirring its contents 
with his fingers. 
‘‘Look, now,’’ said he; ‘‘what have we on the 
paper?’’ 
‘‘Oh, that ’s easy enough,’’ Jules made answer; 
‘it ’s just a mixture of sulphur and iron filings.’’ 
‘‘Yes, a mixture; and could you still tell the one 
substance from the other, all mixed together as they 
are?’’ 
‘‘Nothing easier,’’ answered Emile, examining 
closely what was on the paper. ‘‘ Here, for instance, 
are some grains of sulphur; I know them by their 
yellow color; and here are some of the iron filings, 
as you can tell by their shiny look.’’ 
‘‘And would you undertake to separate the par- 
ticles of one kind from those of the other,—to sort 
them all out?’’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-20
10 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
‘Why not, if it really had to be done? I have 
good eyes, and with the help of a pin I could gather 
all the sulphur together on one side and all the iron 
on the other. Only, I doubt whether my patience 
would hold out to the end.’’ 
‘*Yes, it certainly would be a rather longer job 
than picking over a plate of beans; and Emile’s 
patience, however great it may be, would be hardly 
equal to the task. Still, the thing is not impossible. 
In that little heap, which has now neither the yellow 
color of pure sulphur nor the lustrous gray of pure 
iron, but which has at once something of the two 
colors and is consequently of a greenish appearance 
—in that little heap of matter, I say, an eye of 
sufficient patience and a hand of sufficient dexterity 
could, between them, see and separate what is sul- 
phur from the iron. But there are other ways of 
making the separation. Who will find one? Come, 
now, set your wits to work.’’ 
‘*T have it!’’ cried Jules, passing the ends or poles 
of his magnet back and forth through the mixture. 
‘‘ Just what I was going to propose,’’ said Emile, 
‘af Jules had given me a moment to think about it. 
Now that Uncle has reminded us of the magnet, the 
rest comes of itself.’’ | 
‘‘To hit on the way out of a difficulty after a mo- 
ment’s reflection is all very well, my young friend,”’ 
rejoined his uncle; ‘‘but to hit on it immediately is 
still better. However, you will get even with Jules 
very soon, I am sure. Now let us see how his 
method of sorting the two substances succeeds.’’ 
Jules went on passing his magnet through the mix-  
-P-A-G-E-21
MIXING AND COMBINING 11 
ture of iron filings and sulphur, with the result that 
the metallic particles were attracted to the two poles: 
of the magnet and clung to them, while the sulphur 
was left behind. Again and again the magnet was 
plunged into the heap, and each time it was with- 
drawn loaded at its two extremities with long and 
thick beards of filings which the young operator de- 
tached with his finger-tips, and placed at one side. 
Not a particle of the sulphur clung to the magnet, or 
at least not by the force of attraction, the magnet ex- 
erting no such force on sulphur; and if any scatter- 
ing particles were found among the iron filings set 
aside by themselves, it was simply because they had 
become enmeshed among the grains of metal. A 
second, similar sorting very easily separated them. 
‘<That ’s the way to do it!’’ exclaimed Jules, de- 
lighted with the success of his operations. ‘‘That ’s 
the way, see! The magnet comes out each time 
loaded with filings, and the sulphur is left behind. 
If I went on, it would n’t take me more than ten min- 
utes to separate all the iron on the paper from the 
sulphur. ’’ 
‘‘Tt is unnecessary to continue, my dear child,’’ 
said Uncle Paul. ‘‘Your method is perfect, being 
both expeditious and unfailing in its results. Now 
put the iron filings back with the sulphur and mix 
the two well together. Your magnet, so serviceable 
to us in this process of sorting the two substances, 
is not at the disposal of every one. Would n’t it be 
possible to get along without it, to make the desired 
separation in some other way? It is well, it is even 
indispensable, especially for us with our meager 
 
-P-A-G-E-22
12 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
outfit, to learn how to do without what we do not 
possess, and nevertheless to attain results. Let us, 
then, dispense with our magnet and find some other 
way to separate the iron filings and the sulphur. 
Think a moment. I will help you. Which is the 
heavier of the two substances, the sulphur or the 
iron?’’ 
‘<The iron,’’ replied the two young chemists. 
‘*And what would the iron do if we threw it into 
water?’’ 
‘*It would sink to the bottom.’’ 
‘‘And the sulphur—what would that do? I mean 
finely powdered sulphur, flowers of sulphur, not sul- 
phur in the lump, for that too would sink in water.”’ 
‘‘T see!’? Emile made haste to answer, lest he 
should again be outstripped in this race of wits by 
his elder brother. ‘‘I see! I will throw the whole 
mixture into a glass of water and the iron will sink 
to the bottom, but the sulphur—wait a minute—the 
sulphur—’’ 
‘‘Hush, Jules!’’ cautioned his uncle, as the lad 
showed signs of breaking in. ‘‘Let your brother 
finish.’ 
‘The sulphur,’? repeated Emile, his cheeks 
flushed with animation, ‘‘will stay on the surface; or 
perhaps it will sink, but not so fast as the iron, 
which is much heavier. ‘‘Let’s try it.’’ 
**T was confident, my good Emile,’’ said his unele, 
approvingly, ‘‘that you would soon get even with 
Jules. Yes, your idea is excellent, and if you hesi- 
tate a little in putting it into words, that is only be- 
cause you are in some doubt as to how the sulphur 
 
-P-A-G-E-23
  MIXING AND COMBINING 13 
will behave. I will put the thing to the test for you.”’ 
Uncle Paul thereupon took a large glass and filled 
it with water, into which he dropped a handful of 
the mixture, stirring the liquid at the same time with 
a small wooden stick. Having thus started a brisk 
movement in the glass, he paused and awaited re- 
sults. Very soon the iron filings, because of their 
weight, had settled to the bottom, while the flowers 
of sulphur continued to circle about in the liquid. 
This liquid was next poured off into another glass, 
and when it came to rest the:sulphur held in sus- 
pension gradually settled. Thus the two substances 
were collected, each by itself, the iron in the 
first glass, the sulphur in the second. 
‘“You see, my young friends,’’ said Uncle Paul, — 
‘“it is accomplished quite as expeditiously as with 
the magnet, and the process calls for nothing that 
any one would not have at hand. Let us learn, I 
repeat, to do without what we lack and still to attain 
the end in view. It would be easy, you understand, 
for us to separate the two substances in the whole 
mixture by treating it a handful at a time in the 
manner just shown to you; but that is quite un- 
necessary for my present purpose. Let us sum up 
briefly what we have just learned. Two or more 
substances of different kinds form a mixture when 
their union does not prevent their being separated 
by the simple process of sorting, effected in one way 
or another. The heap there before you is a mix- 
ture of sulphur and iron, and these can be separated 
either with the help of a magnet or with water or, 
given sufficient time and patience, a grain at a time
-P-A-G-E-24
  14 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
by hand. So much for that. Now let us pass on 
to something else.’’ 
So saying, he put the mixture of iron filings and 
sulphur into a bowl, added a little water, and 
kneaded the mass with his fingers until it formed a 
thick paste. Then he took a bottle of clear glass, an 
old discarded bottle that had once contained some 
sort of syrup or medicine, and filled it with the paste. 
Finally, in order to heat the mass somewhat, the 
bottle thus filled was set in the sun, and as it was a 
summer day the result purposed by Uncle Paul was 
not long in being attained, thanks to the temper- 
ature. 
‘‘Now pay close attention,’’ he admonished his 
pupils, ‘‘and you will see something curious.”’ 
The boys were all eyes, all attention, in their 
eagerness to lose nothing of this their first experi- 
ment in chemistry. What was going to happen in 
the bottle? They did not have very long to wait, 
A quarter of an hour had not passed before some: 
thing remarkable took place: the contents of the 
bottle, at first greenish in color from the yellow of 
the sulphur and the gray of the iron, began grad- 
ually to turn black and present the appearance of 
soot, while at the same time jets of vapor accom- 
panied by hissing sounds escaped from the mouth 
of the bottle and small quantities of the black sub- 
stance were ejected as if by the force of an explosion. 
‘* Jules,’’ said his uncle, ‘‘take the bottle in your 
hand a moment and, no matter what happens, don’t 
loose your hold.’’  
-P-A-G-E-25
MIXING AND COMBINING 15 
Unsuspectingly the boy approached and grasped 
the bottle firmly in his hand. 
‘¢Oh, wow!’’ he cried, with a start of pain and sur- 
prise; ‘‘it ’s hot, hot!’’? And all his self-control was 
needed ‘to prevent his dropping the burning bottle. 
Replacing it on the ground more quickly than he had 
taken it up, he turned to his uncle, shaking his fingers 
like one who has inadvertently touched hot iron. 
‘*How it scorches, Uncle!’’ he continued. ‘‘You 
ean’t hold it more than a second, it ’s so hot. If the 
bottle had been over a fire I should have expected 
to find it hot; but there is no fire here to heat it, and 
yet it gets hot like that, all by itself! Who would 
have thought it?’’ | 
Emile in his turn had to handle the wonderful 
bottle that of its own accord grew so hot as almost 
to burn any one touching it. First feeling of it 
cautiously with his finger-tips, then grasping it 
boldly in his hand, he set it down again not less 
quickly than Jules had done, while his looks showed 
the profound astonishment, the utter bewilderment, 
caused by this generation of heat from no apparent 
source. 
‘‘Water was poured on the mixture of iron filings 
and sulphur,’’ said he to himself; ‘‘it was all wet 
with water, which is not exactly the right sort of fuel 
for a fire, and then the whole was set in the sunshine, 
which isn’t what you could call hot, and pretty 
soon, for no reason that I can see, the mixture grew 
scorching hot. I can’t understand it.’’ 
Ah, my little lad, Uncle Paul’s chemical experi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
  16 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
ments will give you many another surprise before 
they are finished! ‘He who enters on the study of 
chemistry finds himself transported to a new world, 
where marvel follows marvel in endless succession. 
But don’t be too bewildered; keep your eyes open, 
remember what you see, and gradually light will 
dawn on these perplexing operations which now 
seem rather to partake of magic than of veritable 
science. 
‘“We have now learned,’’ resumed Uncle Paul, 
‘fat the cost of some little pain to you, that the con- 
tents of the bottle become heated, apparently of 
their own accord, and that this heat is not slight, but 
very considerable, even sufficient to-give a burning 
sensation. All the rest that happened we must re- 
gard as merely resulting from this development of 
heat. The water with which I moistened the mix- 
ture was turned to steam, and hence produced the 
jets of white vapor that escaped from the bottle. 
From this vaporized water came also the hissing 
sounds, the little explosions, and the throwing out of 
solid matter. If I had had at my disposal a larger 
quantity of iron filings and sulphur,—if my mixture, 
instead of being limited to a handful or two, had 
amounted to a full decaliter or more,—I could have 
produced some far more remarkable results. But I 
will content myself with describing to you a curious 
experiment that used to afford no little entertain- 
ment to the onlookers. 
‘“A generous allowance of mingled iron filings and ~ 
sulphur was placed at the bottom of a large hole in — 
the ground, water was sprinkled over the mass, and  
-P-A-G-E-27
y MIXING AND COMBINING 17 
a mound of damp earth was then heaped upon it. 
Soon this little mound would begin to behave exactly 
like a voleano in eruption: the ground would 
tremble all about the base of the mound, the heaped- 
up mass would crack open here and there, and 
through the cracks would spurt jets of steam accom- 
panied by hissing sounds, explosions, and even 
tongues of flame. This was called an artificial vol- 
cano; but I must not omit to add that real voleanoes 
are set in action by something quite different from 
what was going on in that buried mixture of iron 
filings and sulphur, though this is not the time or the 
place to explain the difference. However, there is 
nothing to prevent. your employing some of your 
leisure moments in constructing a miniature volcano 
of your own with a small quantity of iron filings and 
an equal amount of powdered sulphur. Your mole- 
hill of moistened earth, small though it must be, will 
not lack interest for you: it will at least break open 
in cracks and send out hot steam.’’ 
Emile and Jules resolved to gather up all the iron 
filings they could at the locksmith’s and to buy a 
few sous’ worth of flowers of sulphur, with which 
they would, at the earliest opportunity, perform the 
experiment of the artificial voleano. Meanwhile, 
as they were discussing this project, the agitation 
inside the bottle was gradually subsiding and the 
temperature rapidly falling, until finally the bottle 
became cool enough to be handled without inconven- 
ience. Uncle Paul took it up and emptied its con- 
tents on a sheet of paper. What came out was a 
very black powder resembling soot.

‘“‘Now use your eyes,’’ said he, ‘‘and see if you 
ean find any of the sulphur; try to discover even 
one little grain of it if no more.”’ 
The boys rummaged through the heap, seas 
it with a pin and scrutinizing it very closely, but 
could not point to a single particle of sulphur after 
all their pains. 
‘‘Where can it be now?’’ queried the searchers. 
‘‘What has become of all that sulphur? It must 
be there somehow, for we saw it put into the bottle, 
saw it plainly enough. It is somewhere in that black 
heap; nothing could be more certain. It hasn’t 
been lost during the experiment, for it did n’t come 
out of the bottle; nothing much except a little steam 
came out. It must be here, and yet we can’t find 
the tiniest grain of it.’’ 
‘*Perhaps,’’ suggested Jules, ‘‘we can’t see it even 
if it is there because it has turned black; but we ’Il 
try it with fire, and that will settle the question.’’ 
And convinced that he now had the solution of the 
mystery, Jules ran into the kitchen and fetched some 
live coals, on which he dropped a pinch of the black 
powder. But what was his disappointment when, 
after waiting a while and then blowing on the coals 
to make them burn more brightly, and after trying 
another pinch of the powder and then still another, 
each time from a different part of the heap, no igni- 
tion took place, no blue sulphurous flame showed 
itself ! 
‘Well, I declare,’’ exclaimed the bewildered lad, 
‘‘that beats me! With all that sulphur somewhere 
in the powder, it still won’t burn.”’
-P-A-G-E-29
MIXING AND COMBINING 19 
‘And the iron,’’ said Emile, ‘‘I can’t see that, 
either. There ’s nothing there but a sort of black 
soot, nothing at all that shines like iron. Let ’s try 
the magnet and see if it will separate any of the 
filings from the rest.’’ | 
But the magnet produced as little effect as had 
the live coals; no more bristling beards, no more 
strings of iron filings clinging to the poles of the 
magnet, after these had been passed to and fro 
through the black powder. Nothing was attracted, 
nothing showed any tendency to adhere to the piece 
of magnetized iron. 
‘‘Well, that ’s strange,’’ declared Emile, still push- 
ing the magnet into the inert heap, now here, now 
there. ‘‘There’s plenty of iron there, that ’s cer- 
tain, and yet not a particle of it will stick to the 
magnet. If I had n’t seen the iron put there I should 
say there was n’t any in the whole heap.’’ 
‘*And I,’’? chimed in Jules, ‘‘should say there 
was n’t a particle of sulphur there, if I had n’t seen 
it mixed with the iron. Yet of the two substances 
that certainly went into the heap, it now seems to 
contain not an atom; not a speck of sulphur, not a 
speck of iron can be found in what was made out of 
sulphur and iron.”’ 
Uncle Paul let his two nephews have their say, 
convinced that ideas thus born of personal obser- 
vation are worth far more than those adopted on 
the authority of another. To see is to know. But 
after the boys had become thoroughly persuaded of 
their powerlessness to find and separate either the 
sulphur or the iron, then at last he intervened.
-P-A-G-E-30
  20 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
‘‘Well,’’ said he, ‘‘would you now undertake to 
sort the two substances, particle by particle?’’ 
‘Tt ’s no use,’’ was the reply; ‘‘we can’t find the 
least trace of either of them.’’ 
‘‘How about using the magnet?’’ 
‘“‘That ’s no good, either; it won’t attract any- 
thing.’’ 
** Well, then, try water.’’ 
‘‘T have n’t much hope it will help us,’’ answered 
Jules, ‘‘for the whole heap seems to be all of a kind, 
nothing heavy and nothing light. Still, it may be 
worth trying.’’ 
A pinch of the black stuff was dropped into water 
and stirred into the liquid, but it all sank very soon 
to the bottom of the glass, without the slightest 
tendency to any separation. 
‘*So, then,’’ resumed Uncle Paul, ‘‘sorting is no 
longer possible by any of the methods that at first 
succeeded so well. And that is not all: the ap- 
pearance and the properties of the mass before us 
have undergone such a change that, if you did not 
know beforehand what was there, you would never 
suspect the presence of the two ingredients.’’ 
‘‘But who in the world would ever imagine this 
black stuff was made of sulphur and iron?”’ the boys 
exclaimed. 
‘“‘The appearance of the mass is changed, as I 
say,’’ their uncle admitted. ‘‘The sulphur had a 
beautiful yellow color, the iron a lustrous gray, 
whereas the substance resulting from their com- 
bination is neither yellow nor gray nor lustrous; it . 
is, on the contrary, of a deep, dull black. And the

properties are likewise altered: the sulphur was 
found to take fire readily and to burn with a blue 
flame accompanied by stifling fumes, but this black 
substance refuses to ignite when it is placed on glow- 
ing coals; and the iron filing’s were attracted by the 
magnet, which has no effect on the black powder 
here. Hence we must conclude that this powder is 
neither sulphur nor iron, but some third substance 
of a wholly different nature. Shall we gall it a 
mixture of sulphur and iron? Certainly not, for 
it is no longer possible to divide the mass into those 
two ingredients by any process of sorting, the 
properties of sulphur and of iron having given place 
to others showing nothing in common with the first 
two. We have, then, to do with an association far 
more intimate than that known as ‘mixture,’—with 
one that ig-known in chemistry as ‘combination.’ 
eo leaves to the mingling substances their 
di stinctiv® qualities intact; combination causes them 
to disappear, and substitutes others in their place. 
After mixture it is always possible to separate the 
ingredients“by some simple process of sorting ap- 
plicable to“the given case; after combination this 
is never possible. Hence we may say that two or 
more substances are combined when they can no 
longer be separated by the process of sorting, in 
the customary sense of that word; when, in short, 
their characteristic properties have disappeared 
and given place to others. 
‘Observe, also, my young friends, that these new 
properties resulting from combination can by no 
‘means be predicted from the nature of the com-

  22 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
bining substances. Who would ever imagine, with 
no previous study of these curious things, that 
sulphur, yellow and readily combustible, could en- 
ter into the formation of a black and incombustible 
powder? And who would think that iron, with its 
metallic luster and its quick response to the magnet, 
could be capable of entering into the composition 
of a substance having a dull black color and no ten- 
dency whatever to be attracted by the magnet? 
Such things are impossible of prediction without 
previous knowledge. Combination, as you will have 
occasion to note again and again, works a funda- 
mental change in matter, turning white to black and 
black to white, sweet to bitter and bitter to sweet, 
harmless substances to deadly poison and deadly 
poison to something entirely harmless. Watch well. 
the result when two or more substances combine. 
‘‘Still another point demands serious attention. 
In the process of combining, our mixture of iron 
filings and sulphur became much heated by spon- 
taneous action; in fact, it grew so burning hot that 
it was impossible to hold the bottle in one’s hands. 
Jules will long remember the surprise caused him 
by this unexpected heat. In this connection I must 
tell you that this rise in temperature is nothing ex- 
ceptional, nothing peculiar to the combining of iron 
and sulphur. Every time two or more substances 
enter into combination there is heat generated, 
sometimes so slight as to he detected only by the 
most delicate instruments; sometimes, and more 
often, of a degree unbearable to the touch; and 
iii eet  
-P-A-G-E-33
MIXING AND COMBINING 23 
sometimes, again, of such intensity as to be appar- 
ent to the eye in glowing redness or even blinding 
incandescence. In short, whenever combination 
takes place there is more or less heat; and, con- 
versely, whenever heat or light is manifested it is 
almost alwayssa sign that combination is going on.’’ 
‘‘T should like to ask a question, Uncle Paul,’’ 
Jules interposed. ‘‘When coal burns in a furnace, 
is there a combination going on between different 
substances?’’ 
‘‘Certainly there is.’’ 
‘‘One of the substances, then, must be the coal, 
must n’t it?”’ 
‘“Yes, one is the coal.’’ 
‘‘And the other?”’ 
‘‘The other is contained in the air. It is in- 
visible, but none the less it is there. We shall con- 
sider it at length in its proper place.’’ 
‘¢And the wood that burns in the fireplace and 
gives out heat and light?’’ 
‘‘There too we have a combination that includes 
the substance of the wood and that other substance 
contained in the air.’’ 
‘‘And lamps and candles that we use for light?”’ 
‘‘Combination there also.’’ 
‘<Then every time I set fire to anything I start a 
combination?’ 
‘*Precisely ; you cause two different substances to 
combine.’’ 
_**What a funny thing it is, combination!’ 
‘‘More than funny, my boy; it is useful beyond

your power to imagine, and that is why I wish you 
not to remain ignorant of the marvelous trans- 
formations it brings about.”’ 
‘*And will you tell us all about these wonderful 
things?’’ 
‘*So far as I am able I will tell you about them, if 
you will both pay close attention.” 
‘‘Oh, there ’s no danger of our not doing that. 
We won’t lose a word, and we ’ll remember it all, 
too. I like this kind of lessons ever so much better 
than long division and conjugation of verbs. Don’t 
you, Emile?”’ 
‘*T should say so!’’ was the emphatic reply. ‘‘I 
wish I could have lessons like this all day and every 
day. I ’d leave my grammar any time to help make 
an artificial voleano.’’ 
oa: “My dear young friends,’’ their uncle admonished 
_ them, ‘‘don’t let your enthusiasm for chemistry 
. - cause you to slight your grammar, if you wish to 
keep on good terms with me. Chemistry has its 
place, but so has language, and no small place, 
either. Don’t neglect your conjugations, hard 
though they may seem to you. But now let us re- 
turn to our subject of combination. 
‘‘Tt is, as I have said, always accompanied by 
heat, sometimes by light. Explosions, detonations, 
flashes of light, luminous outbursts, and brilliant 
sparks—all the dazzling display of an exhibition of 
fireworks, in short—are by no means exceptional 
when two substances come together in chemical com- 
bination. In the act of thus coming together the 
two substances unite in the closest of bonds; they 
ig et

marry, as we might say, and heat and light make 
haste to celebrate the nuptials just as pinwheels and 
Roman candles celebrate weddings with us. Do not 
laugh at my comparison; it is apter than you think. 
Chemical combination is like marriage: it makes 
one out of two. 
‘‘Now I have to tell you what this substance is 
that has resulted from the marriage of sulphur and 
iron. We cannot call it sulphur, as it is no longer 
sulphur; nor can we call it iron, as it is no longer 
iron. Neither would it do to call it a mixture of 
sulphur and iron, for what was a mixture in the 
beginning has ceased to be one now. Its name in 
hemistry is sulphid of iron, a name that enables 
i to remember the two substances united in the 
bonds of chemical matrimony,—iron, which we here 
write out unchanged, and sulphur, which appears 
somewhat disguised in the word ‘sulphid.’ ”’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
  CHAPTER IIT 
THE SLICE OF TOAST 
HE boys had made their little artificial vol- 
eano, and it had proved to be a success, the 
mole-hill of moist earth becoming much heated, 
cracking open, and giving vent to spurts of steam 
accompanied by sharp hissings. All had turned 
out to the complete satisfaction of the young ex- 
perimenters, and the resulting sulphid of iron, on 
being examined at leisure and subjected to every test 
- their imagination could suggest, was. declared to 
be the same substance as that produced by their 
uncle. At this point he joined them. 
‘*In the black powder now remaining at the heart 
of your artificial voleano,’’ said he, ‘‘there is iron 
and there is sulphur. No possible doubt as to that 
ean lurk in your minds after you have seen this 
substance prepared and, what is more, have pre- 
pared it yourselves with your own hands. — Never- 
theless, there is no sign of either any iron or any 
sulphur in this black powder, so utterly different is 
it in color and general appearance from both those 
substances. Had I begun by showing you this 
powder already made, without telling you of what 
it was composed, you would most certainly never 
have suspected it to contain any sulphur or any 
26  
-P-A-G-E-37
THE SLICE OF TOAST 27 
iron; and had I told you its ingredients without 
letting you witness the combining process, you 
would, I am sure, have taken your uncle’s word for 
it, but at the same time you would have been no 
little astonished. ‘What,’ you would have ex- 
claimed, ‘sulphur in that stuff, there, which is not 
in the least yellow and will not burn? And iron, 
too, where there isn’t the faintest shine of iron and 
nothing sticks to the magnet?’ In short, you would 
have believed me because of your trust in my word, 
but you would not have had the certainty that comes 
from seeing the thing done. 
‘‘This certainty I have given you by means of the 
experiment performed before your very eyes, and 
you have further strengthened that certainty by 
performing the experiment yourselves. We are, 
then, all three of us, firmly convinced that in this 
black substance before us there are both sulphur 
and iron. And now another question arises: Is it 
possible to make the iron and the sulphur here com- 
bined resume each its original form? Can the com- 
bination be undone jand the two ingredients re- 
covered as they were in the beginning? Yes, my 
young friends, the thing is possible, but no simple 
process-of sorting will suffice to disunite the two 
substances. You remember how all your attempts 
to accomplish this were so much wasted effort. 
What combination has joined together, no sorting 
can put asunder. To effect the separation, it is 
necessary to resort to scientific methods belonging 
to the domain of chemistry; and as your. acquire- 
ments in that domain are still of the slightest, I
-P-A-G-E-38
28 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
will not invoke the aid of those methods. Besides, 
for our present purposes the actual separation of 
the sulphur and the iron is of very little impor- 
tance. Inasmuch as the black powder does really 
contain them, it is incontestable that they can, by 
the requisite means, be obtained from that powder; 
and that is all I wish to impress upon you at 
present. ’’ 
‘“‘There can’t be any doubt,’? Jules assented, 
‘‘that a substance made of iron and sulphur must 
furnish iron and sulphur when properly treated. 
No one could dispute that. All the same, I should 
like to see the iron filings come back as iron and 
the flowers of sulphur come back as sulphur.’’ 
‘*T repeat, my dear child, that the operation would 
not be difficult, but it would call for drugs quite 
unknown to you and would be a mysterious and 
perplexing performance in your eyes. Let us see 
but little at a time and see that little plainly; that 
is the way to acquire substantial and lasting knowl- 
edge. 
‘*But, now that we are on the subject, I will say 
to you that what is done by combination is not 
always the easiest thing in the world to be undone. 
,Lhese chemical marriages, signalized by manifesta- 
tions of heat and light, unite substances in bonds 
so close that to sever them it is necessary to employ 
methods known only to advanced science. However 
easy the act of union, the disunion is difficult. Com- 
bination takes place of itself; separation is a more 
arduous undertaking. We have lately seen the iron 
and the sulphur combine in a short time with no aid
-P-A-G-E-39
THE SLICE OF TOAST 29 
from us; but if now we should try to separate them, 
we should meet with enormous resistance, which 
only the most. skilful methods could overcome. 
‘‘There are instances, however, in which quite the 
opposite is to be noted, combination being so difficult 
and delicate a process as to defy our utmost en- 
deavors, but. separation offering so little of resist- 
ance that a mere nothing, almost, will accomplish 
it. There are substances that dissolve their part- 
nership with peculiar ease: a shock, a jar, a breath, 
an imperceptible trifle, will suffice to effect the 
severance. You touch them, you merely move them | 
a little, and, piff/ there is an explosion before you 
can snatch your hand away, with a flying of par- 
ticles in this direction and that as if no such thing 
as union had ever existed. These are chemical mar- 
riages between incompatible natures that sigh only 
for divorce.’’ 
‘“‘And are there really,’’ asked Emile, ‘‘sub- 
stances that fly apart, that go piff! just from being 
touched ?’’ 
‘‘Yes, my child, there certainly are. You your- 
self are familiar with some of them. Those New- 
Year’s bonbons done up in particolored paper and 
known to you as snappers—don’t they recall any- 
thing to your mind?”’ 
‘“Why, yes; each bonbon has a rebus to be 
guessed, and then there ’s a little strip of parch- 
ment that gives a pop when you pull it by both 
ends at once. What is it that makes the little ex- 
plosion?”’ 
*‘It is a substance made by combining different
-P-A-G-E-40
    30 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
ingredients which fly asunder as soon as they are 
disturbed by the parting of the two pieces of parch- 
ment forming the strip. You see how easy the act 
of separation is in this case: just disturb the slum- 
bers of the explosive material by pulling at the two 
ends of the strip, and that is enough to cause a dis- 
ruption accompanied by a sharp report. In like 
manner a house of cards collapses at a mere touch. 
‘‘A similar substance causes the explosion of the 
toy torpedoes that give a pop when you throw them 
on the ground, and to this substance is due also 
the explosive quality in the percussion-caps of guns, 
the cap being ignited by the fall of the hammer 
when the trigger is pulled. A quick spurt of flame 
is produced, and this penetrates the touch-hole and 
discharges the powder in the gun-barrel. Consider 
for a moment the construction of these percussion- 
caps. At the bottom of the little cup-shaped bit of 
copper forming the cap you can see a white sub- 
stance deposited in a thin coating on the metal. It 
is the fulminating-powder, made of several in- 
gredients carefully combined in accordance with 
chemical science and ready to fly apart with violence 
at the mere shock imparted by the hammer. But 
this is enough about these touchy and noisily dan- 
gerous substances, so prone to separate into their 
elements with a loud report as soon as we have 
joined those elements together. Let us proceed to 
something harmless. What should you say there 
is in a Slice of bread?”’ 
‘**T should say—lI should say,’’ Emile hastened to
-P-A-G-E-41
  THE SLICE OF TOAST 31 
answer, ‘‘that there is flour.”? And with that he 
thought he had said the last word on the subject. 
‘‘True,’? assented his uncle, ‘‘but what is there 
in flour?’’ 
‘‘In flour? What can Widia be in it except flour?”’ 
‘‘But what if I told you there was carbon, or what 
amounts to the same thing, charcoal, in flour?’’ 
‘What, charcoal in flour?’’ 
‘‘Ves, my boy, charcoal,—a lot of it.’’ 
‘‘Oh, Uncle, you are only in fun! We don’t eat 
charcoal.’’ 
‘‘Ah, my young sir, you don’t believe it? But 
did n’t I tell you that chemical combination can turn 
black to white, sour to sweet, the uneatable to 
nourishing food? Furthermore, I will show you 
some of this charcoal that is found in bread; or, 
rather, I don’t need to do that, as you have seen it 
hundreds of times and it will be enough now to jog 
your memory. ‘Tell me: don’t you often toast your 
bread a little over the fire before crumbling it 
into milk for your breakfast?’’ 
‘‘Why, yes, I let it get crisp and brown. It’s ever 
so much better that way; it goes better with milk 
when it is toasted just enough to make a crunching 
sound when you break it. In the winter, when the 
stove is hot, you can do it just right.”’ 
‘‘But what if you forget your slice of bread on 
the stove? What if you let it toast too long? What 
happens to it then? Come, now, tell me, from your 
own remembrance of the thing, for I would n’t on 
any account influence your opinion in this serious
-P-A-G-E-42
  32 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
matter. What would happen if your bread stayed 
on the hot stove a whole hour?”’ 
‘That ’s easy enough to answer: it would all turn 
to charcoal. I’ve seen it happen lots of times.’’ 
‘‘Well, then, tell me, where did the charcoal come 
from?—out of the stove?”’ 
‘‘Oh, no, not at all!’ 
‘‘Then from the bread itself?’’ 
‘*Yes, it must have come from the bread.’’ 
‘‘But from no substance can there come anything 
that was not there before; nothing can furnish what 
it does not already have. Consequently, bread, 
which yields charcoal after being exposed some time 
to the action of fire, must itself contain_chareeal, 
_ or carbon if we choose to use that word.”’ 
‘Why, that’s so! I hadn’t thought of it be- 
fore.’’ ; 
‘“There are many other things, my little lad, 
that you have seen again and again without grasp- 
ing their significance, because no one has set you 
on the right road. I shall often turn these common 
occurrences to account by showing you to what im- 
portant truths they open the way when you reflect 
on them a little. Reflection now makes you aware 
that bread contains quantities of carbon.”’ 
‘“‘T admit that bread contains carbon,’’ assented 
Jules. ‘‘The proof is there before your eyes, plain 
enough. But, as Emile says, we don’t eat charcoal, 
and we do eat bread; charcoal is black, and bread is 
white. ’’ 
‘‘If the charcoal, or the carbon, were alone,’’ re-
-P-A-G-E-43
THE SLICE OF TOAST 33 
plied his uncle, ‘‘it would be black and uneatable, as 
you have described it, and it would remain so in- 
definitely. But it is not alone and by itself in bread; 
it is associated or combined with other things, and 
the combination has none of the qualities you have 
named as belonging to charcoal, just as sulphid of 
iron has none of the qualities belonging’ to sulphur 
and iron. These other qualities found in bread are 
driven out by excessive heat, and the charcoal re- 
mains, with all the characteristics peculiar to it,— 
blackness, hardness, brittleness, unpalatability,—in 
short, unmistakable charcoaliness. The heat of the 
stove undoes the work of combination, sundering 
what was joined together in the bread. That is the 
whole secret of the transformation of a slice of 
bread into a slice of charcoal when the toasting 
process has gone too far. Now let us inquire into 
the other things that accompany the carbon in white 
bread. They are known to you; you have seen 
them, and you have smelt their disagreeable odor 
when heat drives them out.’’ 
‘‘T don’t quite understand you,’’ said Jules, 
‘‘ynless you mean that bad-smelling smoke that 
comes from bread when it is turning to charcoal.’’ 
‘‘Hixactly; you have my meaning. That smoke 
was a part of the bread it came from. The char- 
coal and the offensive fumes you know so well 
would, if recombined as they were at first, consti- 
tute precisely the slice of bread as it was before 
being subjected to the action of heat. Heat wrought 
the separation, dissipating some of the constituent

elements in the air and leaving behind, stripped 
of its previous disguise, the black and uneatable 
substance so well known to you as charcoal.’’ 
‘“Then those bad-smelling fumes and the charcoal, 
with nothing else, make bread, and two things that 
couldn’t be eaten separately form by their union 
our chief food?”’ 
‘*You have put it quite correctly: substances that 
by themselves, far from yielding nourishment, would 
be positively harmful if eaten, become by combina- 
tion transformed into excellent food.’ 
‘‘T must believe you, Uncle Paul, because you 
say it is so; but—but—’’ 
‘*‘T understand, my young friend, your hesitation 
and your ‘buts.’ On first hearing these things one 
can hardly believe them, so at variance are they 
with accepted notions. Therefore I do not ask you 
to take my bare word; you must be convinced by 
something other than my authority. Did I not at 
the very beginning prepare the way for these start- 
ling developments by means of a perfectly con- 
clusive experiment? Reeall the black substance that 
we obtained in the medicine-bottle. Recall that 
sulphur now no longer sulphur and that iron now 
no longer iron. Why should there be anything 
more surprising in the fact that charcoal and some 
bad-smelling fumes can cease to be what they now 
are, and can become bread?”’ 
‘*You are right, Uncle, and the best thing to do 
is to take your word for it.”’ 
‘lo take my word for it sometimes may be neces- 
sary, as when the proof of an assertion would entail

of everything, in fact, that went to the building of 
the house? The house, then, is not annihilated, and, 
what is more, not a particle that entered into its 
construction has been reduced to nothing. HKven 
the last grain of sand used in mixing the mortar is 
sure to be in existence somewhere. The wind may 
have blown away some of the plaster-dust as the 
house was being torn down; but that dust, of a 
fineness hardly visible, is nevertheless undestroyed, 
however widely dispersed by the wind; and if it | 
cannot now be gathered up, we can at least see it 
in our mind’s eye, scattered in this direction and | 
that. Of the entire building, therefore, that has ) 
been demolished not a particle of dust has been an- 
nihilated. . | 
‘‘Well, now, fire in its turn is a demolisher, but 
nothing more. It demolishes buildings made of 
many materials combined, but it never reduces to 
nothing the smallest particle, the minutest grain of 
dust, in those materials. We subject to its destruc- 
tive power a mouthful of bread, and destruction 
follows, but never anything like annihilation; for 
what is left, after the fire has played its part, is just 
as truly matter as was the bread itself. That 
residue is in the form of charcoal and certain fumes 
or vapors, the charcoal remaining in a little mass 
by itself, the vapors being dissipated and no longer 
traceable, even as the plaster-dust was lost to view. 
- Rid yourselves, then, forever, of the foolish notion 
of annihilation.’’ — 
“Bunt—’?

‘buts’! What is your difficulty this time, my lad?’’ 
. **When you burn a stick of wood in the fireplace, 
isn’t it reduced to nothing, or almost nothing? 
There ’s only a pinch of ashes left at the end. I see 
how the ashes come from what was once wood, but 
they amount to so little they can’t represent all 
that has been demolished by the fire. The greater 
part of the wood, then, must have been reduced to 
nothing.’’ 
‘*Your observation shows a thoughtful mind, and 
is of the kind I like. Accordingly, I hasten to 
answer you. I just spoke of the plaster-dust blown 
away by the wind in the demolition of our supposed 
house. Is it not plain that, the walls being built 
largely of powdery materials capable of being 
caught up by a passing breeze, a considerable part 
would be thus borne away in various directions, 
leaving behind a proportionately diminished heap 
of refuse?’’ 
‘‘Certainly; I admit that.’’ 
“Tf, now, it were possible in a work of masonry 
for the whole structure to be swept away as im- 
palpable dust, what would remain??’’ 
‘‘Nothing, of course.’’ 
‘‘But would the building on that account have 
been reduced to nothing?’’ 
‘“Why, no; it would have been turned into fine 
dust scattered all about.’’ 
‘Just so with your stick of wood, my little friend: 
fire resolves it into its constituent elements, some of 
which are far more impalpable than the finest dust. 
These are lost to view, being dissipated here and

there in the boundless atmosphere, and as we find 
nothing left but a handful of ashes we are prone to 
believe the rest has been annihilated, whereas it 
still exists, indestructible, floating in the atmosphere 
and having a limpidity, a colorlessness, as complete 
as that of the air itself.’’ 
‘‘Then a stick of wood that has just been burnt up 
in the fireplace is mostly scattered in the air in a 
sort of fine dust that we can’t see?”’ 
‘‘Yes, my boy; and the same is to be said of all 
fuel that we burn to obtain either heat or light.’’ 
‘‘Now I see why wood, when it is burned, seems 
to be reduced to nothing. What was the wood has, 
as you say, been mostly carried away without our 
seeing it, somewhat as the plaster-dust of a house 
that is being torn down is blown away by the wind.”’ 
‘‘Note also, my boys, that out of the materials left 
when a house is torn down, another house can be 
built, different in form and on another site if de- 
sired. The heap of ruins will thus become once 
more a finished structure. But, further, there is no 
reason why these same materials could not be used 
for making other things, the stones for one purpose, 
the bricks for another, the wood for still another, 
so that the ruins of our demolished house would 
enter into various constructions having each its 
own form and purpose and character. 
‘‘Somewhat thus is it with matter in general. 
Let us suppose two, three, or four substances, each 
of a different nature from the others, to enter into 
combination. They function all together in a certain 
manner; they dispose themselves so as to form what

40 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
I will call a kind of building; and by thus associat- 
ing they produce a substance quite different from 
any of the constituent substances, just as our fin- 
ished house is neither sand nor lime, nor plaster, 
nor brick, nor, in fine, any of the materials used by 
the builders. | 
‘‘After a while, for some reason or other, these 
. combined substances separate, and the chemical 
structure is demolished. The ruins are left; there 
has been no loss of matter. What will nature do 
with these ruins? Perhaps any one of a thousand 
things; perhaps use a little of this ingredient for 
one purpose, a little of that for another, and so on 
until the last particle of matter has been utilized 
and the result is a great variety of productions, all 
very different from the original substance. What 
went to make something black, will, it may be, now 
enter into the formation of a white substance; what 
was a part of something sour, may contribute to the 
making of something sweet; and what helped to con- 
stitute a poison, is likely enough to be found again 
in an article of food, just as the bricks of a former 
conduit may by a totally different application serve 
in the construction of a chimney and thus make a 
passage for smoke and flames instead of for water. 
‘“‘Thus it is that nothing is ever annihilated, des- 
pite all appearances to the contrary, appearances 
that so often deceive us because we do not observe 
accurately. Let us pay closer attention, and we 
shall perceive that all matter persists, indestructi- 
ble. It enters into an infinite variety of combina- 
tions, forever uniting and separating and uniting

SIMPLE SUBSTANCES 
66 ET us return now to the black powder, 
the sulphid of iron, that served as our 
starting-point in this discussion. By a process far 
less simple than ordinary sorting, a process known 
to chemical science, this substance can be decom- 
posed and the sulphur and iron separated. Sub- 
jected to the easy decomposition wrought by fire, | 
bread furnishes, as its most notable constituent, — 
carbon. Now of what, in their turn, are carbon . 
and sulphur and iron each composed? -Let me give 
you the answer made to this question by scientific 
investigation as conducted ever since these sub- 
stances became the objects of man’s interest and 
study. No matter with what thoroughness, with 
what elaborate and painstaking experiments, they 
are examined, no matter how powerful the forces 
brought to bear on them, carbon and sulphur and 
iron never give us anything but carbon and sulphur 
and iron.’’ 
‘“But it seems to me,’’ objected Jules, ‘‘that 
sulphur does give something that isn’t sulphur. 
When you set fire to a little of it, there is a blue 
flame and some sort of vapor that makes you cough. 
That vapor must come from the sulphur, but it is 
42
-P-A-G-E-51
      
SIMPLE SUBSTANCES AS 
something very different from sulphur, for it makes 
us cough worse than if we had the whooping-cough, 
and sulphur doesn’t do that even if you hold it 
right under your nose.”’ 
‘‘Let us understand each other, my boy. When 
I say that sulphur never gives us anything but 
- sulphur, I mean that it cannot be decomposed into 
other substances; but I do not by any means assert 
that it cannot by combination with other substances 
produce not only the vapor that makes us cough, but 
also many other things, notably the black powder 
you now know so well, the sulphid of iron. I told you 
that every substance, in burning, combines with 
another which we cannot see, and which is‘contained 
in the atmosphere about us. If sulphur becomes 
enveloped in blue flames, it is a sign that it is com- 
bining with that atmospheric substance. The re- 
sult of this combination is the vapor that makes 
us cough.’’ 
‘hen that vapor is more complicated than sul- 
phur?’’ 
‘$Vas,?? 
‘‘It must be made of two things, sulphur and 
that stuff in the air you told us about, while sulphur 
is made of only one thing, sulphur itself.’’ 
‘‘Quite right. I repeat, then, that sulphur, even 
when put to every sort of test, has never been de- 
composed, never been divided into different sub- 
stances, as, for example, the black powder in our 
medicine-bottle could be divided into iron and sul- 
phur, and as bread could be resolved into several 
ingredients, carbon among them. Sulphur goes to
-P-A-G-E-52
“ 4A THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
the making of a great many things more complicated 
than itself, but can never yield anything simpler. 
When we come to sulphur, decomposition stops; by 
no means at our command have we yet succeeded 
in dividing sulphur into two or more other sub- 
stances. Hence we call sulphur a simple substance, 
meaning that its further simplification is impossible. 
Water, air, a pebble, a piece of wood, a plant, an 
animal—all these may be regarded as substances, 
but they are. not simple substances. Bear that in 
mind. | 
‘‘Carbon and iron are also simple substances, for 
the same reason that sulphur is a simple substance: 
they cannot be made to yield anything except carbon 
and iron unless they are combined with other things; 
but this would not be a simplifying, it would be a 
complicating process. Chemists have carefully ex- 
amined all substances to be found in nature, whether 
on the earth’s surface or beneath, whether in the 
depths of the sea or in the air about and above us, 
and whether belonging to the animal or the vege- 
table or the mineral kingdom; they have examined 
all, studied all, analyzed all, and the fruit of this 
immense task, prosecuted with all possible learn- 
ing and patience, is the conclusion that the number 
of undecomposable or simple substances amounts to 
sixty! or thereabout, including iron, sulphur, and | 
carbon, which we have just been considering.’’ 
**And will you tell us about all these simple sub- 
stances?’’ asked Emile.

list —Translator.

‘‘Not all; far from it, for the greater part would 
not interest us; but you: shall hear about some of 
the more important ones. Moreover, you already 
know a number of simple substances besides the 
three—iron, sulphur, and carbon—which we have 
just examined.’’ 
‘‘T know other simple substances?’’ the boy ex- 
claimed in surprise.. ‘‘I did not know I was so 
wise!’? 
‘*You knew carbon without suspecting it of ob- 
stinately resisting all attempts to decompose it. 
There are more things in your good little head than 
you are aware of; my part is to put some sort of 
order into your jumbled ideas. But I shall refrain 
as far as possible from teaching you outright, pre- 
ferring to make you recall what you already lnow. 
I will tell you at this point, however, that all metals 
are simple substances.”’ 
‘‘T see. Then copper, lead, tin, silver, gold, and | 
others that I forget, are simple substances, just 
the same as iron.’’ 
‘‘An expert chemist could not have put it better. 
They are so many substanees on which decomposi- 
tion has no hold; they are simple substances. But 
there is one metal in common use that Emile has 
omitted. Think! It begins with 2.’’ 
‘‘With 2? Wait—it is zine, the same as our 
watering-cans are made of.’’ 
‘Right. These are not nearly all the metals, 
though; there are many others, and among them 
some extremely curious ones, but they are not in gen- 
eraluse. I will acquaint you with them as fast as we

have occasion to handle them. One, however, might 
be mentioned here. This metal runs like melted 
tin, but at the same time it is cold. It has the color 
of silver, and it goes up and down in a thread-like 
column in the thermometer to show us the tempera- 
ture of the atmosphere.’’ 
‘‘Oh, that is mercury, or quicksilver!’ 
‘‘Hxactly. Its common name of quicksilver might 
deceive you. It has the shiny appearance of silver, 
but none of that metal’s other qualities. It is a 
distinct metal, as different from silver as are lead 
and copper. The term ‘quick’ indicates that it runs 
all about, flowing in little globules and always elud- 
ing the fingers that try to grasp it.”’ 
‘Then quicksilver is a metal, the same as iron, 
copper, lead, or gold?’’ 
‘“‘It is a metal, no more and no less, but different 
from others in that the mere warmth of our climate, 
even in winter, is sufficient to keep it in a molten 
state, whereas to melt lead the heat of burning coal 
ig necessary, and for copper and especially iron it 
takes the hottest kind of furnace. But were it 
cooled sufficiently, it would become hard and not 
unlike a piece of silver in appearance.’’ 
‘‘Money could be made of it, then?’’ 
‘There would be nothing to prevent; but it would 
be a strange kind of money, for a few minutes after 
putting it in your pocket you would find it melted 
and running all about. 
‘‘The color of metals does not vary much: silver 
and mercury are white, tin a little less so, and lead 
still less, while gold is yellow, copper red, and the
-P-A-G-E-55
SIMPLE SUBSTANCES 47 
others, notably iron and zine, grayish white. All 
shine brightly, at least when recently cleaned; or, 
in other words, they all have a metallic luster. But 
you know the proverb, ‘ All that glisters is not gold.’ 
In the same way, all that shines is not metal. You 
would not have to hunt long in the garden to find 
some insect—some beetle, for instance—whose rich 
wing-sheaths have the luster of polished metal, 
though in reality they are nothing but scales of horn. 
Certain stones, judged by their deceptive luster, 
might be mistaken, some for gold, others for silver; 
and yet they contain not the slightest particle of 
these two metals. The glittering yellow spangles ? 
mixed with the blue sand used for drying ink after 
writing have nothing in common with gold except 
the glitter, and are not even made of metal. So 
it is that all metals, without exception, have the 
peculiar luster called metallic; but this luster may 
be found, just as bright, in a great many other 
things that are not metals. 
‘<The other simple substances, sulphur and car- 
bon among them, are without metallic luster; some 
there are, too, and very important ones, that are 
colorless, invisible, of the same subtle quality as 
air. These non-metallic simple substances are 
called by the general name of metalloids. Carbon 
is a metalloid, sulphur is another. The number of 
metalloids is not great, about a dozen perhaps, but 
the part they play is highly important. One might 
say of them what is, alas, only too true of human

beings: those that make the greatest noise are not 
the ones that are the most useful. Indeed, though 
the metalloids are of primary importance in the 
construction of the things about us, being no less 
necessary in the countless works of nature than 
stone and bricks and mortar in our buildings, there 
are some that many of us do not even know by 
name. One must at least have read some book on 
chemistry to be aware of their existence. If we 
were not told of them by those more learned than 
ourselves, we should remain ignorant of them to the 
end of our days. One of these important substances 
—and it is one without which we should speedily 
die—has a name that is probably unfamiliar to your 
young ears; you may, in fact, never have heard it 
» mentioned. It is oxygen.’’ 
‘Oh, what a funny name!’’ cried Emile. ‘‘I ’va 
never heard it before.’’ 
‘‘And these: hydrogen, nitrogen—do you know 
them?’’ 
‘‘No more than the other.’’ 
‘‘T suspected as much. They are the names of two 
good and useful metalloids that quietly perform 
their appointed tasks without soliciting public 
notice, just as a generous giver is willing to remain 
unknown, provided only his gift reaches its destina- 
tion. All three—oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen— 
are the less likely to attract popular attention, 
despite the importance of their services, because 
they have the invisibility, the thinness, of air. Very 
often, too, they are concealed in combinations in 
which only the higher science can detect their pres-
-P-A-G-E-57
SIMPLE SUBSTANCES 49 
ence. Reason enough, then, for our remaining in 
ignorance about these substances that play the lead- 
ing parts in nature’s never-ending drama.”’ 
‘‘Are they, then, so very important?’’ 
‘‘Yes, my boy, they are extremely important.’’ 
‘‘More so than gold?’’ 
‘‘You are all astray, my dear Emile, on this sub- 
ject of importance. Gold is unquestionably a very 
useful metal to man; it is the sign of riches, of the 
Savings amassed by labor. Coined into money, it 
passes from hand to hand and is good in all ex- 
changes, in all commercial transactions. It is a 
splendid part to play, I admit; but if gold were to 
disappear entirely from the earth, what would 
happen? Nothing very serious. Banks might be 
inconvenienced, commerce upset for a little while, 
but that is all. The world would soon move on 
again as before. Suppose, on the other hand, one 
of these three metalloids whose names you have 
just learned—oxygen, for example—should disap- 
pear. Immediately everything on earth would die, 
from the biggest animal to the tiniest worm; all 
plant life would perish, from the giant of the forest 
to the smallest thread of moss. Life would hence- 
forth be impossible and this inhabited globe become 
a gloomy solitude, with man, animal, and plant for- 
ever banished. That, as you see, would be a far 
more serious disaster than the inconvenience of a 
banker or the vexation of a merchant. 
‘‘TIn the general scheme of things, gold plays only 
an insignificant part, almost a negligible part. If 
it were lacking altogether, the order of nature would
-P-A-G-E-58
  50 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
not be affected. Oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen, 
on the contrary, fulfil in this world of ours funce- 
tions so important that if any one of these three 
were taken away, everything would be turned topsy- 
turvy and life would be rendered impossible. To 
these three carbon must be added, for its part is not 
less important; and thus we have four substances in- 
dispensable to all life, vegetable as well as animal. 
Now compare with them, if you like, this gold that 
everybody talks about, is familiar with, longs for, 
and that many wear themselves out in trying to get. 
Was I not right when I said that making the most 
noise in the world is a very different thing from 
rendering the highest service? Believe me, my 
young friends, gold is but a poor thing when looked 
at from the proper point of view.’’ 
‘‘And you will tell us about this oxygen, this 
hydrogen and nitrogen, that the world cannot do 
without?’’ asked Jules. 
‘‘Certainly. I shall begin with them. Honor to 
whom honor is due. To tell you what they are and 
what they do will take up more time than all the 
rest. To complete the list of metalloids that you 
need henceforth to know, at least by name, I will 
mention one other. It is the substance you see at 
the tip end of a match, overlying a layer of sulphur, 
and taking fire with friction. It will give a mild 
glow, too, when rubbed between the fingers in a 
darkened room.”’ 
‘‘That must be phosphorus.”’ 
‘Yes, phosphorus. It also is a metalloid. Let
-P-A-G-E-59

us sum up at this point. There are about sixty 
simple substances, divided into metals and metal- 
loids. Metals have a peculiar sheen called metallic 
luster. Those known to you are iron, copper, lead, 
tin, zine, mercury, silver, and gold. Some of the 
others deserve our attention as well, and I will 
speak of them as occasion arises. There are, all 
told, about fifty? metals. The metalloids, which 
are much fewer in number, or about a dozen in all, 
have not the so-called metallic luster. The most 
important ones are oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, car- 
bon, sulphur, and phosphorus. The first three in 
the list are, like air, invisible. 
‘‘Simple substances, metals as well as metalloids, 
are also called elements. By this is meant that they 
are the undecomposable or prime substances used 
by nature in all her works.”’ 
‘‘But, Uncle Paul,’’ Jules here interposed, ‘‘I 
read in a book that there are only four elements in 
nature, not sixty, and that they are earth, air, fire 
and water.’’ 
‘That book repeated the false notions of ancient 
times, notions preserved to our day in popular 
speech, in which long habit is slow to give place to 
the progress of science. It was, indeed, formerly 
believed that everything in nature could be traced 
back to earth, air, fire, and water, which were 
thought to be the four undecomposable substances, 
the four elements, of which all things were made. 
    1The recognized number is now nearer seventy than fifty.— 
Translator.   
-P-A-G-E-60
  52 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
But it has been found after more careful study that 
not one of the elements as understood by the ancients 
is really a simple substance. 
‘<In the first place, fire—or, rather, heat—is not 
a material thing at all, and consequently has no 
place in the list of simple substances, which are 
matter even when they are invisible. All matter 
can be weighed and measured. We speak of a cubic 
foot of oxygen, a pound of sulphur; but it would be 
the height of absurdity to speak of a cubic foot of 
heat or a pound of warmth. You might just as well 
pretend to weigh by the pound and measure by the 
quart the notes that come from the strings of a 
Violin. ’’ 
‘*A pound of F sharp or a quart of E flat would 
certainly sound funny,’’ Jules agreed, smiling at 
the odd association of words. 
‘*You smile, naturally enough, for a musical note 
cannot be weighed in the scales or measured by the 
quart or the bushel. And why is this impossible? 
Because sound is not matter, but a movement trans- 
mitted in successive waves from the sonorous body 
to our ears. The same with heat: it is a peculiar 
mode of motion. To my regret, I can but touch on 
this interesting subject at this time, since to ex- 
plain it properly would take so long that chemistry 
would in the meantime be forgotten. I will simply 
say, then, that heat cannot be classed as an element, 
because it is not matter. 
‘‘When we come to air, however, we have quite 
another thing. It can be measured by the quart, — 
weighed by the pound. It is probably new to you
-P-A-G-E-61
SIMPLE SUBSTANCES 53 
to hear air spoken of as being weighed and meas- 
ured; but nothing could be more correct. Physics 
could teach us much about this if we had the time 
just now to give to it.\ Air is matter, though, un- 
fortunately for the credit of the ancient theory, this 
matter is not a simple substance. Instead of being 
made of one thing, air is made of two very different 
things. I will tell you their names before I under- 
take to prove to you by experiment the truth of this 
assertion. Air is composed of oxygen and nitrogen. 
‘Nor is water any more truly a simple substance, 
an element, than air. At the proper time I will 
show you that it is a compound of oxygen and 
hydrogen. 
‘As to earth, what is meant by that word? Evi- 
dently the mixture of mineral substances—sand, 
clay, gravel, pebbles, rocks, stones—that form the 
solid part of the globe. Thus, instead of being an 
element, one simple substance, it contains all the 
elements, from the first to the last. From the earth 
are obtained all the metals and various metalloids; 
in fact, all simple substances could be derived from 
this source if we cared to decompose those combina- 
tions in which many of them are at present tied 
up. We may, then, say of the four elements, com- 
monly so called after the ancient conception of the 
matter, that not one of them will bear critical ex- 
amination, not one will prove to be a simple sub- 
stance, an element, as the word is understood to- 
day.”’

manner, with the threescore elements at her dis-

ments, she demands but a few materials; and not

countless ways, these elements or simple substances 
form everything on and in the earth. | Nothing, ab- 
solutely nothing is known to us that, when decom- 
posed (if it be not simple to begin with), fails to 
resolve itself into a certain number of metals or 
metalloids or both.’’ 
‘Then everything comes from these same simple 
substances?” asked the children. 
‘‘Hiverything that is not already a simple sub- 
stance. Consider for a moment the element that

you see most often under one or another of its 
various disguises,—carbon. I have shown it to you 
' as forming a part of bread. You know, too, that 
wood contains it, as can be seen from the charred 
fagots in the open fire. Now, the carbon in bread 
and that in the trunks and branches of trees are 
exactly the same, so that in the ever-changing com- 
binations of nature the carbon in the loaf of bread 
might reappear in an oak fagot, and that in the oak 
fagot might turn up again in the loaf of bread.”’ 
‘¢And so,’’ observed Emile, more in jest than in 
earnest, ‘‘when we eat a slice of bread and butter, 
we are eating what might have made a knotty 
stump.’’ 
‘“Who knows, then, my little lad,’’ his uncle took 
him up, ‘‘how many knotty stumps you have eaten 
in your lifetime? I hope soon to show you that 
your jesting remark comes nearer the truth than 
you aaa ” 
ele Paul, I won’t say anything more! Your 
simple substances are too much for me.’’ 
‘““Too much for you? Not at all. But perhaps 
you feel yourself, for the moment, a little dazzled 
by the blinding light of a new truth, just as a strong 
ray of sunshine dazzles the eyes. Let us continue, 
and gradually everything will appear clear to you. 
The carbon in an oak fagot—why should it not have 
gone to the making of a pear, an apple, or a chest- 
nut? Is there not carbon in those?”’ 
‘‘Ves, there is,’’ replied Jules. ‘‘When you leave 
chestnuts on the coals too long they turn to char- 
coal, and if you forget apples or pears put to bake
-P-A-G-E-64
56 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
in the oven you find them nothing but lumps of 
charcoal.’’ 
‘‘Again, this charred chestnut, apple, or pear is 
of the same substance as that in firewood and in 
bread. Do you now begin to glimpse the fact that it 
is possible to eat what, by a change of destination, 
might have become a stump or a stick for the fire?”’ 
‘‘T can more than glimpse it,’’ Emile answered; 
‘*T see it.’’ 
‘‘And you will soon see it clearer. If, instead of 
using olive-oil on our salad or for frying fish, we 
put it into a lamp, it will burn and give light. Now 
let us hold a piece of window-glass or a plate over 
the flame. Instantly a coating of black dust col- 
lects on it.’’ 
‘‘T know, that is lampblack. I make my glasses 
dark with it when I want to look at the sun in an 
eclipse. ’’ 
‘¢ And what is this lampblack?’’ 
‘‘It looks very much like charcoal-dust.’’ 
‘‘It really is charcoal, or carbon. And where 
does this carbon come from, if you please?’’ 
‘‘T don’t see where it could come from, unless 
from the oil burned in the lamp.”’ 
‘“Tt does come from the oil, that is plain; from the 
oil decomposed by the heat of the flame. So there is 
carbon in oil. Needless to add, this carbon differs 
not at all from other carbon. It is found in grease, 
in tallow, for candles and tapers give lampblack just 
as does the oil-burning lamp. It is also in resin, 
which burns with a thick black smoke; it is in—

a complete list. I will mention finally the mutton- 
chops you have seen so often on the dinner-table. 
If the cook is not careful, what becomes of them on 
the gridiron?’’ 
‘*Why, that ’s so!’’ Emile exclaimed. ‘‘I had n’t 
thought of it. If you let them cook too long, the 
chops all turn to charcoal.’’ 
‘‘What, then, do we infer from that?’’ asked, 
Uncle Paul. 
‘We infer that there is carbon in meat. It must 
be everywhere!”’ 
‘‘Hiverywhere? Oh, no! Far from it. But car- 
bon occurs very often. You will find it especially 
in all animal and vegetable products. All these 
substances, when decomposed by fire, leave carbon 
in their ashes. So you can easily make out as long

element.’’ 
‘Paper, white as it is, must have some, for it

paper come from plants?’’

‘*Milk,’’ asked Jules, ‘‘which is still whiter than 
paper—does that too have carbon in it? I have 
seen the foam turn black at the edge of the saucepan 
when the fire was too hot.’’

But let that do for the present. Further examples 
are not needed to show you what varied uses carbon 
can serve at the hands of Mother Nature. Now will

Emile recite the fable he has been learning by heart 
the last few days?”’ 
‘*Which one?’’ 
‘“The one about the sculptor and the statue of 
Jupiter.”’ 
““Oh, yes, I know: 
‘A bloek of marble, fair to see, 
Filled with delight a sculptor’s soul. 
He bought it. ‘Now what shall it be, 
A god, a table, or a bowl? 
***A god were best, an awful god, 
With thunderbolt in lifted hand. 
Mankind shall tremble at his nod, 
His name be feared in every land.’ ’’ 
Here Uncle Paul stopped the reciter: ‘‘That is 
enough, my boy. You have a good memory. What 
does the good La Fontaine tell us? He tells us that 
a sculptor, viewing the superb block of marble he 
had just bought, asked himself what he should do 
with his purchase. His chisel could make of it at 
will a bath for a sumptuous palace, the bowl of a 
fountain for a princely garden, or a modest slab, a 
commonplace bureau-top or mantelpiece. He de- 
cided on a god. The block of marble which could 
become a bowl in which to wash face and hands, 
shall be Jove the Thunderer, before whom all man- 
kind falls prostrate. Out of one and the same ma- 
terial the chisel is to bring forth, not a trivial piece 
of furniture, but a noble statue. In like manner 
does Nature proceed, able as she is to make what- 
ever she chooses out of the chemicals at her disposal. 
 
-P-A-G-E-67

A little carbon, let us say, is at hand. ‘What shall 
my art make of it?’ she asks. ‘Shall it be a flower, 
turnip, flesh, or hair of an animal? It shall be a 
flower; more than that, it shall by its coloring and 
perfume be the queen of the flower garden.’ And 
the splendid rose comes forth from the carbon that 
might have become sheep’s tallow or a part of a 
donkey’s horny hoof.’ 
‘*But there ’s something else in the rose besides 
this carbon that makes so many things, isn’t 
there?’’ asked Emile. 
‘‘Certainly; otherwise the carbon would remain 
carbon and nothing more. It is combined with 
other simple substances. The same must be said 
of it in all the other things we have just named as 
containing carbon.”’ 
‘‘Then,’’ said Jules, summing up what his uncle 
had told them, ‘‘bread, milk, grease, oil, fruit, 
flowers, linen, cotton, paper, and lots of other things, 
all contain carbon and also various other elements 
that never change their nature, whether they are 
in a flower or in a lump of tallow, in a piece of 
paper or in a stick of wood. They are always the 
same metals and the same metalloids. And are our 
bodies too made of these things?”’’ 
‘‘As far as matter is concerned, man does not 
differ from the rest of creation. His body has for 
its constituents exactly the same metals and meta 
loids.’’ 
‘“What!’’ cried Emile, surprised at this human 
chemistry. ‘‘Are there metals in us? Are our 
bodies mines? I could believe it if we were all \ } 
}
-P-A-G-E-68
  60 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
sword-swallowers like the jugglers we see at the 
fair; but we have n’t quite come to that yet.’’ 
‘‘Agreed. Nevertheless, there is iron in us,— 
precisely the same metal as is swallowed by the © 
jugglers you speak of. And iron is so indispens- 
able to us that without it we should lead a languish- 
ing life; or, rather, we should find it impossible to 
live at all. It is iron, let me add in this connection, 
that gives to our blood its red color.’’ 
‘*T know that our blood is colored red somehow or 
other; but, all the same, I know that nobody can eat 
metals, not even the juggler who fools us with his 
cleverness. Where does this coloring matter come 
from, then?’’ 
‘‘Like carbon, sulphur, and whatever other ele- 
ments the body needs, it comes from our food, which 
contains it, a little here and a little there, without 
our knowing it. And are you quite sure that we 
never take iron, real iron without any disguise? At 
your age, when the mere work of growing is some- 
thing considerable, and strength is none too great, 
the doctor often orders iron, which is taken in the 
form of a very fine powder, or is given to us to 
drink in water that has had old iron in it for some 
time, and has thus become slightly charged with the 
rust. That is not exactly the same as swallowing 
swords, but it is eating iron nevertheless.’’ 
‘“‘T am ready now to believe we eat as many 
metals as you please,’’ Emile assented. 
‘Not so fast! Don’t let us make the human body 
a mine, as you called it just now. I am speaking 
only of iron, to which might be added three or four
-P-A-G-E-69
COMPOUND SUBSTANCES 61 
other metals that, unfortunately, you know nothing 
about as yet. There are metals familiar to us all, 
such as lead, copper, zine, gold, and silver, that have 
no place in the human body or in animals or in 
plants. Certain metals, indeed, if they were intro- 
duced into the body, would endanger life, for they 
are poisons. I keep to iron, then, and will add that 
very little of it is enough to give color and other 
peculiar properties to the blood,—so little, in fact, 
that the body of an animal the size of an ox would 
furnish hardly enough iron to make a nail. I will 
add that this nail would cost a fabulous sum, so 
much labor and pains would have to be expended in 
the mining of this animal ore. If necessary, the 
thing could be done, which is all I wish to make 
you understand. 
‘“We have now reached the point where you 
ought to begin to perceive that simple substances, by 
combining in many ways, produce a vast variety 
of other substances endowed with widely varying 
properties. These substances are called compound 
because they are each composed of a number of 
elements. Water is a compound substance; so are 
flour, wood, and paper, oil and grease, pine resin, 
animal flesh and horn, the essence of the rose, and, 
in short, such a multitude of things that the lst 
would never come to an end. Water is composed of 
oxygen and hydrogen, two metalloids that we shall 
take an early opportunity to become acquainted 
with. The other things I have just named contain 
carbon among their elements. 
‘‘So vast is the number of compound substances 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
62 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
that we might almost call it infinite. At any rate, 
no limit is known. And yet all these compounds 
l coiaie from the mixing together of two or more of 
those simple substances that do not number so very 
many, some threescore in all. Furthermore, many 
of these simple substances play so unimportant a 
part that their entire omission would make no ap- 
preciable difference in the grand total of the world’s 
material riches. Among these minor elements I 
will mention gold. Confining ourselves to the fun- 
damentals, we can see that, at most, only about a 
dozen simple substances contribute to form the im- 
mense majority of the products of nature.’’ 
‘But there ’s one difficulty, it seems to me,’’ ob- 
jected Jules; ‘‘and it strikes me all the more after 
what you have just said. I was wondering how 
such a lot of different things—so many that perhaps 
elements. And now I wonder still more how the 
great majority of these countless things can come 
from only a dozen elements.”’ 
‘‘T was expecting this objection to be raised, and 
was about to answer it in advance when you got 
ahead of me}for which, in truth, I am very glad, as 
thus I receive a fresh proof of the reflective quality 
of your mind. I have proposed a puzzle to you, and 
now I will use an illustration that will help you to 
solve it. Our alphabet has twenty-six letters. How 
many words can be formed with these characters?’’ » 
‘“Why—I—I don’t know what to say. I have 
never counted them, for a dictionary, even a small 
 
-P-A-G-E-71
COMPOUND SUBSTANCES 63 
one,. has lots and lots of words. Let us say ten 
thousand.”’ : 
‘‘We will let it go at that—ten thousand, in round 
numbers. It is not necessary to be very exact in 
this matter. You will notice that we are speaking 
only of our own language; but the same characters 
could be used for writing all the languages of the 
world that have been spoken in the past, that are 
spoken to-day, or that may be spoken in the future. 
I omit certain instances of peculiar pronunciation, 
which are negligible in this connection. With our 
twenty-six letters, then, Latin, French, English, 
Italian, Spanish, German, Danish, Swedish, and 
many other languages are written. The same 
letters, too, could be used for Greek, Chinese, Hin- 
dustani, Arabic, and all other tongues with written 
characters differing from ours only inform. There 
is no language, even to the lowest negro dialect, that 
could not be represented in some sort by our alpha- 
bet. In this grand total of languages and dialects 
what multitudes of words there must be!’’ 
‘“We should have to count them,’’ said Jules, ‘‘not 
by tens of thousands, but by millions and millions.’’ 
‘‘Now, imagine for the moment, my boy, that these 
letters represent our simple substances, while words 
represent the compound substances. The compar- 
ison is not so very far-fetched, for just as words hav- 
ing each its own value, its peculiar meaning, are 
formed by combining letters in groups of two, three, 
four, or more, and in such and such an order, so 
compound substances are made by combining certain 
elements which, according to their properties, their
-P-A-G-E-72
  64 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
number, and the manner of their grouping, deter- 
mine the nature of the compound.’’ 
‘*Simple substances, then,’’ put in Jules, ‘‘are the 
elements of material things just as letters are the 
elements of words.’’ - 
‘Yes, my boy.’’ 
‘‘Then the number of compound substances must 
be as immense as the number of words in all the 
languages of the world. Still, I should say the al- 
phabet would give the greater variety. It has 
twenty-six letters, and you have just told us that 
most compound substances are made from a dozen 
elements at most. Twenty-six ought to give more 
combinations than twelve.’’ 
‘*T will ask you to note that the number of letters 
might be considerably reduced and still the alpha- 
bet would represent all the various vocal sounds. 
What difference is there, I ask you, in the pronun- 
ciation of k, g, and hard c? None. One of these 
characters is necessary, the others are superfluous. 
In like manner soft ¢ is the same as the hissing s, 
and x is simply ks, nor does y as a vowel differ from 
2. Rid of its duplicating characters, the alphabet 
could, as you see, be reduced a good deal and still be 
rich enough to furnish the elements of innumerable 
words. But I admit that even so there remain more 
letters than there are simple substances forming the 
great majority of compounds. In their modes of 
grouping, however, the elements enjoy a great ad- 
vantage over the letters of the alphabet. 
‘‘To make a word, we usually group two, three, 
four, often five or six, and even more letters. Take
-P-A-G-E-73
  COMPOUND SUBSTANCES 65 
for example, that long and cumbrous word, inter- 
communicability. One must draw a good breath in 
order to pronounce it all. There are twenty letters 
in the word, or almost as many as there are in 
the whole alphabet, though it is true that some of 
these letters are repeated, which reduces the number 
of separate characters to thirteen. Chemical com- 
bination scorns such cumbrous piling up of elements, 
and imposes upon itself a rigid rule never to resort 
to it, holding that’ complicated mixtures are none of 
its business. To form compound substances it \ 
groups only two simple ones, or sometimes three, 
very rarely four. Imagine a language with words of 
only two, three, or at most four letters, and you will 
get a notion of the compound substances resulting 
from the union of chemical elements. Sulphid of 
iron is a compound of two elements,—a word of two 
letters, if you choose, continuing our comparison. 
Water is another. Oil has three, and animal flesh 
four. Compounds of two elements are called ‘binary 
compounds’; those of three, ‘ternary,’ and those of 
four ‘quaternary.’ These terms come from the 
Latin words meaning respectively two, three, and 
four. 
‘*Now, if four elements at the most, and commonly 
only two or three, are united in combination, how is 
it that there can be an almost infinite variety of com- 
pounds? To aid us in explaining this, take the word 
ram, for example. For the initial letter r substi- 
tute another, and then another, and so on, and we 
have the common words, gain, lain, vain, wain, pain, 
and others, all belonging to our language. In the 
     
-P-A-G-E-74
  
ade’ 66 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
same way pin becomes tim and din and sin. By a 
simple change of one letter, the rest of the word 
remaining unaltered, we have a word of a wholly 
different meaning. So it is with chemical com- 
pounds: let one element be replaced by another, the 
rest remaining unchanged, and behold, at once we 
have new properties, a substance very different 
from the first. 
‘‘But, further than this, there is still another 
change that gives an even greater variety of com- 
pounds. Just as in a single word the same letter 
may be repeated several times (note the letter 1% 
occurring four times in the long word just cited as 
an example), so the same element is, in many sub- 
stances, repeated in chemical combination. It is 
taken two, three, four, five, and even more times, 
producing each time a compound having its own 
peculiar properties. We should hunt in vain in the 
dictionary for words suitable as illustrations of this 
principle, for our language refuses to repeat the 
same letter over and over again in one short word. 
But let us imagine a series of words such as ba, bba, 
bbba, bbbba, and so on, and let us suppose that each 
of these, although containing only the letters b 
and a, one of which is repeated, has a meaning en- 
tirely different from that of any of the others. We 
can thus gain a fairly good idea of what takes place 
in compound substances.’’ 
‘“Tf that ’s the way of it,’’ said Jules, ‘‘I can see 
well enough that the number of compounds must be 
very great,—that it must be enormous, even with 
only the dozen simple substances that play the chief
-P-A-G-E-75
COMPOUND SUBSTANCES 67 
part. One element changed and another repeated 
must produce an almost endless variety of different 
groups.’’ 
‘¢And what does Emile think about it?’’ asked his 
uncle. 
‘‘T rather agree with Jules: there ’s much more 
variety than I had thought. But I should see it 
better if I could understand how bba is really differ- 
ent from ba.’’ : 
‘You would like to have an example of a com- 
pound substance whose nature changes compleveny 
when one of its elements is doubled?’’ 
‘‘Oh, Uncle, that ’s just what I should like to see; 
and Jules would too, I ’m sure.”’ | 
‘‘T can easily gratify you, my little lads.’’ 
And so saying Uncle Paul took from one of his 
drawers something that he showed to his listeners. 
It was a rather heavy object, of a beautiful shiny 
yellow, and when exposed to the sun it gave out 
flashes of light. From its brilliance it might have 
passed for a metal. 
‘‘But that is gold!’’ cried Emile in astonishment 
at sight of the splendid stone; ‘‘a lump of gold as 
big as your two fists!’’ 
‘‘Tt is asses’ gold, my boy,’’ replied his uncle, 
‘‘named thus by miners because it deceives the ig- 
norant, and they take it for something precious, 
whereas it is really of small value. You can find 
as many of these stones as you please among the 
rocks in the mountains; but it wouldn’t profit you 
a penny to pick them up. This substance is also 
called, in more learned language, iron pyrites, the
-P-A-G-E-76
68 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
last part of the term being taken from the Greek 
word for fire; for the stone will, in fact, emit sparks 
when struck with a piece of steel,—as, for example, 
with the back of a knife,—and these sparks are 
brighter than those obtained with flint and steel.’’ 
Here, by way of illustration, Uncle Paul made the 
stone that looked like gold give out brilliant sparks 
by striking it with a knife. Then he continued his 
talk: 
de ‘Tron pyrites or asses’ gold has nothing about it 
of real gold but its luster and its yellow color. It 
is not a simple substance, but a compound of two 
elements that are familiar to you, though you 
would n’t imagine them to be here, disguised as they 
are by the act of combination. One is iron, the 
other sulphur.’’ 
‘That shiny yellow stuff that you would take 
for gold is made of iron and sulphur, like the ugly 
black powder in the artificial voleano?’’ was Emile’s 
incredulous exclamation. 
‘‘It is made of iron and sulphur, and nothing 
else.’’ 
‘‘But how different it is from either of them!”’ 
‘‘This difference comes from the sulphur’s being 
repeated in asses’ gold.’’ 
‘‘The word, instead of making ba, makes bba?’’ 
‘‘Hxactly. To indicate this repetition of the sul- 
phur, they say in chemistry that iron pyrites is the 
bisulphid of iron, and you know that the first syl- 
lable of that term means twice.”’ 
‘Then it ’s the same as if they said ‘twice sulphur 
and once iron.’ The black powder in the artificial 
 
-P-A-G-E-77
COMPOUND SUBSTANCES 69 
  voleano is sulphid of iron, and this asses’ gold is 
bisulphid of iron.’’ 
‘‘Precisely. It couldn’t have been put better.’’ 
‘‘T thank you, Uncle Paul, for showing us this 
splendid stone. It will make me remember that in 
chemistry ba and bba are not at all the same thing.’’
-P-A-G-E-78
CHAPTER VI 
EXPERIMENTS WITH THE BREATH 
MPRESSED by its glitter, the boys often 
talked to each other about the asses’ gold which, 
despite its rich appearance, is made of just such 
sulphur and iron as go to make the black powder of 
the artificial voleano, but with a double quantity of 
sulphur. The magnificent stone left with them by 
their uncle they took delight in striking with steel, 
in some dark place, so as to produce bright flashes _ 
of sparks. Furthermore, directed by Uncle Paul, 
they resolved to visit some of the neighboring moun- 
tains in search of more stones like this one. So suc- 
cessful was their quest that Jules’s cabinet became 
filled with pieces of iron pyrites of all sizes and of 
varying degrees of brilliancy. There were some 
golden yellow, cut in facets as if a lapidary had taken 
it into his head to polish them, while others were 
shapeless and more of an iron gray. Uncle Paul 
told them that the former were crystals, and that the 
majority of substances can under favorable condi- 
tions take regular shapes in which smooth facets 
arrange themselves according to geometrical laws. 
Such substances are then said to be crystallized. 
‘We will return to this subject later if opportun- 
ity occurs,’’ said he; ‘‘but to-day other things de-

mand our attention. So far we have been merely 
discussing, talking together, supporting our asser- 
tions by sundry facts picked up here and there. 
Your minds had to be prepared, had to become accus- 
tomed to certain ideas and expressions. But, now 
that you are ripe for it, we are going to have a little 
real chemistry; that is, we are going to perform 
some experiments. To see, touch, taste, handle, and 
smell for oneself, and to observe at leisure,—that 
is the only way to learn quickly and well. So, then, 
we will proceed with our experiments.’’ 
‘‘Shall we have lots of them?’’ was the eager in- 
quiry. 
‘‘As many as you please, my lads. Along that 
line, chemistry never comes to an end.”’ 
‘‘Oh, that ll be splendid! We shall never get 
tired of experiments. And may we repeat them by 
ourselves just as we did with the artificial voleano? 
That will make twice as much fun.’’ 
‘‘Tf they are not dangerous there is no reason 
why you should not perform the experiments your- 
selves. When there is any danger I will tell you 
beforehand what precautions are necessary. I 
count on Jules to take the lead, for I know how 
careful and how skilful he is.”’ 
_ At this word of praise a slight color flushed the 
older boy’s pale cheeks. 
‘‘Now, what shall we begin with?’’ said Uncle 
Paul. ‘‘It shall be with a substance that plays a 
most important part, air. Let me tell you at the out- 
set, if you do not already know it, that air forms 
around the earth an envelop known as the atmos-
-P-A-G-E-80
  72 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
_-> phere and having a thickness of about fifteen leagues 
at the most moderate estimate. It is a substance of 
an extremely subtle nature, so intangible and invis- 
ible that one is at first surprised to hear it spoken of 
as matter. ‘What!’ we exclaim; ‘air is matter? Air 
has weight?’ Yes, my boys, air is matter and can 
be weighed. With its delicate instruments physics 
can weigh air, and it teaches us that a liter of this 
invisible matter weighs one and three tenths grams. 
That is very little when compared with the weight 
of lead, it is true; but it is a good deal when com- 
pared with other substances that we shall soon learn 
about. ’’ 
‘*Are there things lighter than air?’’ asked Jules 
in surprise. ‘‘Yet people say, ‘as light as air,’ as 
if there were nothing else of so little weight.’’ 
“Let them say it, but rest assured there are other 
/ things that in respect to weight are to air what wood 
_istolead. Air is colorless and, for that reason, in- 
\.visible. Understand me correctly, however: when 
I say ‘colorless’ and ‘invisible’ I am speaking of air 
in small quantities; in large volumes that would no 
longer be true. Water will help us to understand 
this. Seen in a drinking-glass or in a bottle, it is 
colorless; seen in a deep body, as in a lake or the 
sea, it shows its blue color according to the depth of 
the water. Likewise with air: it is of a blue tinge, 
but so pale that to become perceptible the body of 
air must have enormous thickness. That explains 
why the sky is blue: the thickness of the atmospheric 
envelop (some fifteen leagues, as I said before)
-P-A-G-E-81
  EXPERIMENTS WITH THE BREATH 713 
brings out its true color, which is imperceptible to 
the eye in a layer of moderate depth. 
‘‘TInvisible, subtle, intangible, escaping the clutch 
of the fingers, air seems to present insurmountable 
difficulties to any one wishing to study it closely. If 
we desire to submit it to tests that will reveal its 
nature and properties, we must take a certain quan- 
tity of it, isolate it from the rest of the atmosphere, 
shut it up in some sort of container, make it flow out 
in this direction or that as we may choose, carry it 
from place to place, expose it to such and such con- 
ditions,—in short, make it obedient to our control 
as we should a piece of stone or a pebble. But how 
ean we see the invisible, grasp the elusive, handle 
the intangible? The difficulty, you see, is no small 
one.’’ 
‘‘Tt seems to me so great,’’ replied Jules, ‘‘that 
IT can’t begin to guess how it is overcome. But I 
have too much confidence in you, Uncle, to doubt 
that we shall manage it somehow.”’ 
‘We must; otherwise we should be held up at the 
very start. And that would be a pity, for air would 
not be the only thing to get the better of us. There 
are many other substances just as invisible, just 
as subtle, just as intangible as air, and of inestim- 
able importance. They would all remain unknown 
to us if our present difficulty could not be overcome; 
and the great science of our day, chemistry, the 
mother of industrial wonders, would remain to be 
discovered in some ever-retreating future when the 
art of handling the intangible should have been 
mastered. All these substances, having the subtle   
 
-P-A-G-E-82
74 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
and elusive quality of air, are known by the general 
name of gases. Air itself is a gas.”’ 
‘‘And there is the gas they use for lighting, too,”’ 
said Emile. ‘‘I thought that was the only thing 
called gas.’’ 
‘‘What is burned in chandeliers in our cities is 
a gas, but not the only one. There are many others, 
each with its own peculiar qualities. The word gas, 
then, isa general term by which we designate all sub- 
stances having a tenuity or thinness similar to that 
of air; and if we commonly restrict it to illuminating 
gas, it is because the latter is much better known to 
us all than any of the others except air. In ordinary 
language a general term is thus monopolized by one 
particular substance. 
‘*But to return to our problem, how can we handle 
air, how subject any gas whatever to observation? 
I will show you. Suppose we wish to collect the air 
that comes from our lungs,—our breath, in short. 
I dip a tumbler into a bowl of water ‘and fill it, after 
which I invert it in the bowl and raise it. As long 
as the brim remains completely submerged the water 
does not run out, but is held suspended above the 
general level of the liquid in the bowl. I see by 
your looks that this lifting of water and holding it 
motionless above the level of the surrounding liquid 
excites some surprise. I will return to this in a mo- 
ment and explain the cause; but just now let us pro- 
ceed with our experiment. Here is the glass, full 
of water and held up by one hand, with the brim 
immersed. Now with a glass tube—or, if necessary, 
with a reed or a big straw—lI blow under the glass,

  EXPERIMENTS WITH THE BREATH 15 
and the air from my lungs makes the water bubble. 
Because of its superior lightness it makes its way 
upward in big globules through the contents of the 
glass until it reaches the inverted tumbler’s bottom, 
As the breath—or, to express it better, the exhaled 
air—collects in the upper part of the glass, the water 
thus displaced descends and reénters the bowl. The 
thing is done: I have collected my breath; there it 
WAUTIER Sc) SN NS SS ae T [Ls Al TOON OUNCE 
  is in the glass ready to undergo any tests we choose 
to apply.”’ 
‘‘How easy it is, after all!’’ exclaimed Emile, 
much impressed by what he had just seen. 
‘‘It is nearly always so, my child,—very easy 
when we know how, very difficult when we do not.”’ 
‘“Then this glass holds what we send out of our 
mouth when we blow out a candle; I mean, it is filled 
with breath. It certainly is a curious thing to collect 
like this what can’t be seen or felt. When I let out 
my breath after puffing up my cheeks, I don’t see 
anything at all; and yet I just now saw your breath 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
  76 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
going up through the water and making it bubble.’’ 
‘The commotion in the water made it seem to you 
as if you saw what is by its very nature invisible.’’ 
‘‘Now that the water is still again, I see nothing, 
though I am sure the part of the glass that looks 
empty really has something in it; for I saw that 
something come and take the place of the water, 
which went down slowly in the glass. All the same, 
it seems to me very funny to have that glass full of 
Uncle Paul’s breath. May I try filling it with 
mine?’? 
‘*Certainly; but first you must empty out what 
is now in the glass.’’ 
‘‘Himpty it out? But how?”’ 
‘*In this way.’’ 
So saying, Uncle Paul took the glass and inclined 
it just enough to let a part of the brim come to the 
surface of the water, whereupon something escaped 
with a bubbling sound. 
‘‘It ’s gone,’’ cried Emile. ‘‘Let who wants to, 
run after it and catch it in the air where it has dis- 
appeared.’’ 
The glass being refilled with water, Emile took the 
straw and blew as his uncle had done, controlling 
the muscles of his cheeks so that he might watch the 
bubbles as they rose one by one; and great was his 
delight to see so easily, and to shut up in a glass so 
securely, what he had thought must always remain 
invisible and unmanageable. 
‘“That was soon done,’’ said he, when the glass 
was full. ‘‘I could fill a big bottle with my breath 
just as easily as a tumbler. May I, Uncle Paul?”’
-P-A-G-E-85
EXPERIMENTS WITH THE BREATH T7 
‘‘You may, my boy. If you enjoy the experiment 
of bottling up your breath, I for my part enjoy 
your enthusiasm.’’ 
A large bottle of clear glass with a wide neck was 
standing on the table, having been placed there by 
Uncle Paul for later experiments. Emile took it 
up and went to the bowl, but soon saw that the latter 
was not deep enough to dip the bottle into so as to 
fill it and then admit of its being lifted up with 
the mouth under water as had just been done with 
the glass. ‘‘Look,’’ said he, after a few vain 
attempts; ‘‘the way you did it with the tumbler 
won’t work. What shall I do?’’ 
‘Since the difficulty does not yield to a frontal 
attack, let us turn its flank. Watch me.’’ 
Therewith Uncle Paul placed the bottle on the 
table and filled it from the carafe. Then, clapping 
the palm of his left hand over the mouth as a stopper, 
he took the bottle in his other hand, turned it upside 
down, and plunged it while stopped in this manner 
into the bowl of water. Then he removed his left 
hand, and the bottle with its neck immersed retained 
its liquid contents suspended above the exterior 
level, without losing a drop. 
‘You always find a way out, Uncle Paul,’’ said 
Emile, delighted at this easy way of overcoming 
the difficulty. 
‘‘We must practise a little ingenuity, my child; 
for if we did n’t, what could we accomplish with the 
poor apparatus our small village provides? Skill 
must make up for the defects of our appliances.’’ 
Emile blew, filling the bottle with his breath in a
-P-A-G-E-86
    78 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
few minutes. Then, after Jules also had performed 
the operation, so as to accustom himself a little to 
handling gas, their uncle continued thus: 
‘*Why does the water in the glass and in the bottle 
remain above the level of that in the bowl? This 
is what we must now find out, though not in all its 
details, for to do so would take us out of chemistry 
into physics. <A brief explanation, just enough to 
show you the cause of what now excites your sur- 
prise, is all that I at present propose. 
‘¢ Air, I told you, can be weighed just the same as 
any other substance; and its weight, as I said be- 
fore, has been found to be one gram and three deci- 
grams a liter. That is very little, but the atmos-_ 
phere is at least fifteen leagues thick, which must 
make an enormous number of liters piled one on top 
of another. Since, then, the atmosphere has weight 
it must press with all its force on objects immersed 
in it; it must press on them from above, from below, 
from the right, from the left, from every direction. 
It presses, for instance, on the water in our bowl; 
and the pressure, being transmitted by the liquid 
to the mouth of the bottle, keeps the water in the 
latter suspended above the exterior level. 
‘‘A striking experiment will convince you of this 
thrust exerted by the atmosphere. Over the mouth 
of a bottle filled with water we place a piece of damp 
paper, and while this is held in position with one 
hand the bottle is turned upside down with the other. 
Then the hand holding the paper can be withdrawn 
without the escape of a drop of water from the in- 
verted bottle. It is the atmosphere pushing in every
-P-A-G-E-87
EXPERIMENTS WITH THE BREATH 79 
direction, upward as well as downward, that holds 
the water in. The office of the paper is to keep the 
air from entering the liquid mass and breaking it 
up, Which would immediately cause the escape of 
the water.’’ 
‘‘And shall we try this wonderful experiment?’’ 
asked the boys, in eager curiosity. 
‘‘Shall we try it? you say. Do you think I 
should have told you about it if we were not going to 
try it? Upandatitthen! MHere is our bottle, and 
here are paper and water; nothing further is 
needed.’’ : 
The bottle was filled to the brim and a piece of 
damp paper placed over its mouth. 
With his right hand Uncle Paul 
raised the bottle by its bottom, 
holding the fingers of his left hand 
meanwhile on the paper. Then he 
carefully turned the bottle upside 
down, let go of the paper, and the 
thing was done: not a drop of 
water escaped from the bottle, even 
though its neck pointed downward. Emile, more 
excited than ever, could not contain himself. 
‘““That ’s fine!’’ he declared, ‘‘not a drop comes 
_out of the bottle, and it ’s turned upside down, too. 
If it had a cork in it, the thing would be natural 
enough; but the paper doesn’t cork the bottle; if 
you blew on it, it would come away. How long will 
the water stay in like that?’’ 
‘‘As long as you please; as long as one has 
patience to hold the bottle as I am holding it now.’’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
  80 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
‘‘But the water is trying all the time to get out? 
It presses down and would fall if it could?”’ 
‘‘Yes, it keeps pressing down, and tends to fall, 
but the stronger pressure of the atmosphere: re- 
strains it.’’ 
‘¢ And what if we took away the piece of paper?”’ 
‘‘Immediately the water would run out, just as 
we have so often seen it do from a bottle or carafe 
tipped sidewise, or, still more, from one turned up- 
side down. This piece of paper closes the bottle’s 
mouth so that water and air are placed in a position 
where one pushes squarely against the other. With- 
out it the water would slip through the air, the air 
through the water, and in this mutual evasion the 
bottle would speedily empty itself. Put two iron 
rods together, end to end, and exert pressure; there 
will be mutual resistance. That is what happens 
when we put the piece of paper between the air and 
the water. Butif the iron rods were made into two 
bundles of very fine needles pushing against each 
other, end to end, these same rods would slip into 
and through each other just as happens with the air 
and water when there is no paper to separate them. 
‘‘To return to the bottle that Emile used to hold 
the breath he blew into it: as long as its mouth is 
immersed in the bowl the water it contains does not 
run out, but is held above the surrounding level by 
the force of the air pushing against it. Now, what 
would happen if instead of this bottle we used a very 
tall container,—a tube, for example, closed at its 
upper end? Would this tube, whatever its length, 
still remain full when raised out of the water except
-P-A-G-E-89
EXPERIMENTS WITH THE BREATH 81 
its lower end? No. If the tube were raised so as 
to project only ten meters above the surface of the 
water, it would indeed remain full; but if it pro- 
jected beyond this height the part of the tube above 
ten meters would be empty. The pressure of the 
atmosphere can hold up a column of water only ten 
meters high; that is the extreme limit. Our con- 
tainers here, as you see, are well within this limit 
in their height. However big or tall our bottles may 
be, there is no danger of their being so tall that the 
pressure of the atmosphere cannot hold back the 
water that fills them. 
‘*Hinally, suppose we wish s 
to transfer a quantityof gas 
from one vessel to another, 
or to tranfuse it as they say. @ 
This gas shall, again, be our 
breath, which will perfectly 
well serve the purpose of 
the demonstration I have in 
view. I fill a glass with it by blowing through a 
tube in the manner just shown; and now I propose 
to make this volume of gas pass into another con- 
tainer, or it may be I wish to transfer only half of 
it. I fill this second glass with water and invert it 
in the bowl so as to keep only the brim immersed. 
The first glass, with only its brim still in the 
water, is then tilted sidewise under the other, where- 
upon the air it contains escapes in bubbles and 
passes into the second glass, wholly or in part, as I 
choose, 
‘To decant a liquid—to pour wine, for example,   
-P-A-G-E-90
  82 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
from one bottle into another—a funnel is used, as 
you know. The same utensil is often very useful 
for decanting gases; but a chemist’s funnel, which 
is likely to come into contact with all sorts of cor- 
rosive liquids, is of glass, a very resistant substance. 
As long as only gas is to be transfused, it will suf- 
fice to add a modest tin funnel to our simple outfit; 
but if we had a glass funnel it would be better and 
more in keeping with chemical practice. Further- 
more, glass has one inestimable advantage over tin: 
it is transparent, and thus allows us to see all that 
takes place within it. But with nothing beyond a 
common tin funnel we are not necessarily brought 
to a halt in our operations. 
‘‘A funnel of some sort is indispensable for trans- 
fusing a gas from a container of any kind to a bottle 
with a narrow neck such as bottles commonly have. 
Of course the transfusion is effected under water. 
The bottle, filled with water and held with its mouth 
immersed, has the funnel inserted into it by one 
hand operating under water. That done, the jar or 
whatever it may be that contains the gas is brought 
under the funnel and inclined little by little until 
bubbles of the gas escape into the flaring mouth of 
the funnel and pass thence into the bottle. 
‘‘That will do for to-day, my boys. You are now 
in a position to repeat these experiments by your- 
selves as often as you like, collecting your breath in 
a glass, tranfusing it into another, or into a bottle 
turned upside down, thus getting your hand into 
practice. I shall soon need your assistance.’’

CHAPTER VII 
EXPERIMENTS WITH AIR 
NCLE PAUL took a rather deep dish and in 
U the center he fixed a candle with a few 
drops of melted wax. Then he lighted the candle 
and covered it with a large, wide-mouthed bottle of 
clear glass. After this he poured water into the 
dish until it was quite full. 
Meanwhile the children looked 
on, chattering between themselves 
and wondering what their uncle 
was up to with his lighted candle 
all surrounded with water and 
Mi burning in a bottle upside down 
f . in the middle of a dish. What 
<u curious experiment was he 
e—=s about to perform? They were 
not left long in doubt. Every- 
thing Si ee Uncle Paul began thus: 
‘What is there in the bottle?’’ 
‘‘A lighted candle,’’ Emile hastened to answer. 
‘‘Ts there nothing else there?’’ 
‘‘No, nothing. I don’t see anything but the 
candle.’’ 
‘*You forget that there are some things we cannot 
83    
      
 
-P-A-G-E-92
  84 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
see. You must use here the eyes of the mind, not 
those of the body.”’ 
Emile scratched behind his ear with the tip of his 
finger and winked hard, as was his wont when puz- 
zled. He was trying to think what the invisible ° 
thing could be that his uncle referred to. Jules 
came to his aid. 
‘‘It is air,’’ declared the older boy. ‘‘There is 
air in the bottle where the candle is burning.’’ 
‘‘But Uncle Paul didn’t put any there,’’ Emile 
rejoined. 
‘‘Ts it necessary to put any there, little giddy- 
pate?’’ his uncle demanded. ‘‘Is not the bottle full 
of it without any help from us? All the vessels we 
use, all our flasks, jars, bottles, glasses, containers 
of whatever kind, being immersed in the atmosphere, 
in the very depths of this ocean of air, are filled with 
this gas as they would be with water if they were 
plunged uncorked into that liquid. If it does not 
contain anything else, every bottle, whether right 
side up or wrong side up, is full of air, which gets in 
of itself, usually without our paying any heed to it. 
When a bottle of wine is drained to the last drop, we 
say itis empty. Should we really call it empty if we 
chose our words with extreme care? Certainly not, 
for the so-called empty bottle is as full as ever, full 
to the top; it is filled with the air that has taken the 
wine’s place. And so it is with all vessels when we 
empty them of their contents: if they were full be- 
fore, they remain full afterward, though the nature 
of their contents has changed. Nothing is abso-
-P-A-G-E-93
EXPERIMENTS WITH AIR 85 
lutely empty, nothing can be empty, when air is free 
to enter it. We can, it is true, empty a vessel in the 
literal sense; we can create a void or vacuum, as the 
learned men say; but that is an elaborate operation, 
and its success demands proper appliances.’’ 
‘‘You mean an air-pump?’’ asked Jules. 
‘“‘Yes, my boy, an air-pump, a special kind of 
pump that sucks the air from a tightly closed vessel 
and discharges it into the outer atmospheres, But 
as nothing of the sort has been used here, my hottle 
is full of air exactly like the air around us. Conse- 
quently the candle is burning in the midst of the air 
contained in the bottle. Now, why did I fill the dish 
with water? Forthisreason: The air in the bottle 
is the substance I propose to study with you by sub- 
jecting it to certain experiments, particularly this 
experiment with the lighted candle. And so we must 
separate this air from the rest of the atmosphere, 
isolating it in a closed container, as otherwise our 
experiment could not be carried through; and, fur- 
thermore, we should be unable to tell what portion 
of the atmosphere we had been experimenting with. 
The bottle alone does not furnish complete isola- 
tion, for, between its mouth and the bottom of the 
dish, air could easily slip in and mix with that 
already in the bottle. A barrier must be interposed 
to separate the inner from the outer air, and this 
barrier is furnished by the bed of water in the 
dish. Thus we obtain perfect isolation; and you 
will also see that the water serves a second purpose, 
being an indicator of what takes place in the bottle. 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
  86 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
But I must not distract your attention by too much 
explanation. Now watch closely what is going on 
in the bottle.’’ 
Behold, in a few minutes the candle-flame, which 
at first was full and bright like that of a candle 
burning in the open air instead of in a bottle, began 
to get dimmer little by little, becoming shorter, 
shrinking in width, and looking dull and smoky. 
Soon it had diminished to a mere point, and finally 
to nothing at all. The flame was quite extinguished. 
‘*Look!’’ eried Emile. ‘‘The candle has gone 
out without any one’s blowing it out.’ 
‘‘Wait a moment, Emile, and we will presently 
talk the thing over. Just now keep your eyes open 
and watch what is happening in the water, the in- 
dicator I spoke about.’’ 
Emile and Jules watched attentively and saw the 
water gradually rise in the neck of the bottle, com- 
pletely fill it, and go still farther, so that an appreci- 
able part of the bottle, at first filled with air, was 
occupied by the liquid coming from the dish and 
slipping in from beneath. Its ascent was slow, and 
when at last it was finished Uncle Paul broke the 
silence. 
‘“Now,’’ said he, ‘‘you may ask all the questions 
you please.’’ 
‘‘T should like to have one thing explained,’’ said 
Emile. ‘‘When a candle is burning and you want to 
put it out, you have to blow on it. But here no 
one blew out the candle, and if we had wanted to 
we couldn’t have done it on account of the bottle    
-P-A-G-E-95
EXPERIMENTS WITH AIR 87 
over it. Not a breath of air came, that is certain; 
no puff of wind. Under cover of the bottle no 
breath of air or puff of wind could get at it. The 
flame was perfectly still; it stood up straight and 
calm; and yet, without any reason that I can see, 
it got dim and dwindled to nothing but a point, 
and then at last went out altogether.’’ 
‘‘T should like to ask something, too,’’ put in 
the older boy. ‘‘The bottle was at first filled full 
of air; now, besides the air that is left, it has several 
fingers of water from the dish. I saw this water 
rise little by little as the flame dwindled. So some- 
thing has been taken from what was in the bottle at 
first, for the water rose and took its place. But 
how did that something disappear, and where has it 
gone to? If you had not told us and made us un- 
derstand that nothing is ever annihilated, I should 
say that a part of the air was being annihilated 
while the candle burned.”’ 
‘‘Jules’s point shall have our attention first, as it 
will furnish us the explanation of Emile’s difficulty. 
A part of the bottle’s gaseous contents has disap- 
peared, apparently; the water’s rising above its 
level in the dish to fill the vacancy would seem to 
prove it in a way to convince the most incredulous. 
Something, I repeat, has disappeared, so far as we 
can see; but we must not for a moment suppose it 
has been annihilated. Let us investigate further, 
and we shall discover what has become of this 
something that seems to be lacking. 
‘‘T have already told you that heat and light are
-P-A-G-E-96
88 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
nearly always sure signs of the mingling of sub- 
stances of different natures,—of chemical combina- 
tion, in short.’’ 
‘‘T remember,’’ said Jules. ‘‘You called it the 
fireworks that celebrate chemical weddings. Can 
such weddings take place in a bottle?”’ 
‘‘Yes. The flame was hot and it gave out light; 
hence a chemical combination was going on, pro- 
ducing this heat and light. And what substances 
were they that were thus combining? One of them, 
beyond a doubt, was supplied by the fatty material 
of the candle as it melted under the heat from the 
lighted wick; the other could have come only from 
the air, since the bottle contained nothing else. 
From this combination sprang something new, some- 
thing that was no longer either candle grease or 
air, something with properties that neither air nor 
candle possesses. The compound thus formed is an 
invisible substance, a gas just as air is a gas, and 
for that reason invisible.’’ 
‘‘But if a. gas is made out of air and candle 
grease,’’ Jules objected, ‘‘this gas takes the place 
of the air that disappeared, and the bottle ought 
to be just as full as it was before. I don’t see why 
the water rises.’’ 
‘‘Wait; we are coming to that. The compound 
we are speaking of is readily soluble in water, 
somewhat as sugar and salt easily dissolve in that 
liquid. Once dissolved in this way, sugar and salt 
disappear, become invisible, and the only evidence 
we have of their presence is the sweet or the salt
-P-A-G-E-97
  EXPERIMENTS WITH AIR 89 
taste of the water. In like manner, what is pro- 
duced by the flame disappears: it enters the water 
and becomes incorporated with it. Similar but 
much richer gaseous solutions are familiar to you. 
I hardly need to remind you of beer, cider, spar- 
kling wine, and soda-water, drinks that make the 
cork pop and that foam when poured into the glass. 
All these liquids hold quantities of gas in solution, 
—so much of it, in fact, that they cannot retain it 
when escape is possible; and therefore it thrusts out 
the cork and covers the drink with foam. Now, 
curiously enough, the gas that makes these bever- 
ages foam is precisely the gas that the candle- 
flame manufactures. Some day I will take this in- 
teresting subject up again. I mention it here in 
passing, but have not time to dwell on it. 
‘‘Since the compound produced by the candle 
grease and the air disappears from sight, being’ 
dissolved in the water, a vacant space must be left; 
and this it is that the water in the dish, under 
pressure of the atmosphere, rises in the bottle to 
occupy, showing us by the height to which it rises 
the amount of air that has disappeared.’’ 
‘‘It has n’t risen far,’’ said Emile. ‘‘See! It’s 
only just above the neck.’’ 
‘That shows that the candle burned up only a 
small part of the air in the bottle,—a tenth part, 
let us say, if the water that has made its way in 
fills a tenth part of the bottle’s total capacity.’’ 
‘‘But as there is still so much air in the bottle, 
why didn’t the candle use that up just as it did the
-P-A-G-E-98
  90 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
other part? I don’t see that it is any different from 
what that was. It is still transparent, invisible, and 
has n’t a particle of smoke.’’ | 
_ “Here is where we come to your question, my 
boy, the question why the candle went out without 
being blown out. The candle-flame is caused by 
the combination of the material of the candle with 
certain other material contained in the air. Air 
and candle are equally necessary in feeding the 
flame. If either be lacking, the flame is extin- 
guished. As to the candle’s being necessary, that 
is plain enough: no fuel, no flame. But in regard 
to the air you don’t feel quite so sure. And yet 
what you have just witnessed ought to give you 
food for reflection. If the candle went out of its 
own accord, there was certainly something want- 
ing.”’ 
“‘T’m ready enough to admit that. Yes, that 
must have been the trouble; something was want- 
ing, as no one blew out the candle and there was n’t 
a breath of wind. Now, what was it?’’ 
‘‘What was lacking must have been air, as the 
bottle contained nothing else to begin with. Air 
is indispensable for keeping a flame burning.’’ 
‘‘But there is still air in the bottle,—lots of it, 
almost the whole bottleful.’’ 
‘‘T do not deny it; but listen a moment. Is it not 
possible that air, instead of being made of only one 
substance, is made of two of different kinds, equally 
colorless, equally subtle and invisible, and very 
thoroughly mixed together? Is it not possible, too, 
that one of these gaseous substances can keep a
-P-A-G-E-99
      EXPERIMENTS WITH AIR 91 
flame going, whereas the other cannot, and that the 
first-named forms but a small part of the atmos- 
phere as compared with the second? If so, when 
this first part is used up in the bottle, the candle 
goes out of itself, as we say, the candle grease no 
longer finding what it needs for burning, and there 
will be left in the bottle, colorless and invisible, as 
it was in the first place, the other gaseous element, 
of no use for keeping a flame alive.’’ 
‘‘How clear that makes everything, Unele,’’ said 
Jules. ‘‘Now I see it all perfectly. The candle 
went out of itself when there was no more of this 
eas material to keep it burning. By combining with 
a little burnt grease, this matter turned into some- 
thing else, a gas that in dissolving disappeared in 
the water while the water in the dish rose and took 
its place. Now the bottle holds only the kind of gas 
of no use to a flame, and that is why the candle 
stopped burning.’’ 
‘Yes, that ’s the way of it, with one slight correc- 
tion. A candle-flame is not by any means a fire 
strong enough to use up all the gaseous element 
needed for the act of burning; there is still some 
of it left over, but too little to keep the candle alight. 
The air has become impoverished, but not deprived 
of all it contained of the element in question. An- 
other day we will try to find a way to remove the 
last trace of this flame-supporting gas. At present 
let us rest content with our partial result. The con- 
tents of the bottle will no longer keep a candle burn- 
ing, and a lighted candle put into the bottle would 
immediately be extinguished.’’  
-P-A-G-E-100
92 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
‘‘A candle would go out if put into that bottle?”’ 
asked Emile, still rather inclined to doubt. 
‘“‘Certainly it would, and almost as quickly as if 
you plunged it into water. How can you expect it 
to burn? If the one that was there could not burn, 
why should another do any better? They are all 
made alike.’’ 
' “All the same, I ’d like to see it tried.’’ 
‘*Your curiosity shall be gratified.’’ 
With this Uncle Paul took a short candle-end 
and tied it to a wire bent up at the bottom. Then, 
raising the bottle a little with one hand, he slipped 
the palm of the other over the mouth, which was still 
under water, thus stopping it up. After this he 
set the bottle upright on the table without let- . 
ting it lose any of its contents, liquid or gase- 
ous, and withdrew the hand he had used as a stop- 
per. 
‘‘But the air in the bottle will get out,’’ objected 
Emile, ‘‘if you leave the bottle open.’’ 
‘“There is no danger of that,’’ his uncle reassured 
him. ‘‘The invisible gas there, being as heavy as 
air, will not escape. However, to make sure of it, 
here is a stopper we can use.’’ 
It was a little piece of glass from a broken win- 
dow-pane. Uncle Paul placed it over the bottle’s 
mouth. 
‘*Now,’’ said he, ‘‘let us proceed to our experi- 
ment.”’ 
The candle fastened to the wire was lighted and 
allowed to burn until the flame was bright and full, 
after which Uncle Paul removed the piece of glass
-P-A-G-E-101
EXPERIMENTS WITH AIR 93 
and gently let down into the bottle the lighted 
candle, which almost immediately became dim and 
went out. A second attempt met with the same 
speedy result. If violently blown upon or plunged 
into water, the candle could not have gone out more 
promptly. 
‘Well, are you convinced now, Master Unbe- 
liever? Here, try it for yourself, so as to be quite 
satisfied.’’ 
Emile took the candle and began the experiment 
over again, lowering the flame little by little, very 
gently, very cautiously, so as to keep it away from 
the sides of the bottle, thinking 
that careful management might 
accustom the flame to this unsuit- ha. 
able atmosphere. But it mn 
was of no use. Though 
several times repeated, the 
attempt invariably failed: 
a little higher or a little 
lower in the bottle, the flame 
always went out. a 
‘‘TIt ’s no good, the candle won’t burn sroee i de- 
clared the boy, tired of attempting the impossible. 
‘‘T should be perfectly sure of it if I were certain 
the bottle had nothing to do with it. Could n’t the 
nearness of the glass and the want of space make 
the candle go out?”’ 
‘‘That is a very natural question, but it is soon 
’ answered. Here is a bottle like the first, of the 
same size and with the same wide neck. It is filled 
with air that has not been impoverished by anything  
-P-A-G-E-102
94 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
burning in it, the same kind of air as that all around 
us. Repeat your experiment with that.’’ 
Emile lowered the candle into the bottle, and it 
burned very well, exactly as if in the open air. 
Whether put in abruptly or gently, near to or away 
from the enclosing glass, it remained alight and 
burned as it had outside. His constant failure 
with the first bottle and his repeated success with 
the second dispelled Emile’s last lingering doubt. 
‘<T have nothing more to say,’’ he declared. ‘‘The 
stuff in the bottle where the first candle burned 
doesn’t suit it now at all.”’ 
‘*You are convinced, then?’’ 
é¢Vas.?? 
‘*Completely?’’ 
‘6Ves,’? 
‘<Then I will continue. What we conclude from 
our experiment is that air is composed of two differ- 
ent gases, equally invisible but of so unlike a nature, 
each to the other, as to prevent our confusing 
them. One, the less abundant, suits the candle- 
flame and combustion in general; the other, more 
plentiful, does not. The first is called oxygen, the 
second nitrogen. They are two simple substances, 
two metalloids. As to air, which is a mixture of 
these two gases, we can no longer properly call it 
an element as did the ancients. It is a compound 
of two substances of very different natures. This 
has been known only a comparatively short 
time.’’ 
‘‘T wonder why it took so long to find out about 
air,’’? said Jules. ‘‘It would have been such a simple

thing to burn a candle in a bottle turned upside 
down in a dish of water.’’ 
‘‘Very simple, undoubtedly; but it had to be 
thought of, and there was the difficulty.’’

FURTHER EXPERIMENTS WITH AIR 
66 UR experiment with the candle _ burn- 
ing in a bottle turned upside down in 
water, is one of the easiest to perform, calling for 
nothing that is not readily procurable. But, un- 
fortunately, it is an incomplete experiment, for the 
reason I have already indicated. It shows us that 
air is composed of two different gases, one that will 
keep a flame burning and is called oxygen, and an- 
other of a contrary nature in this respect and known 
as nitrogen; but it does not tell us how much there 
is of each, because what is left after the candle 
goes out, still retains a good proportion of oxygen 
instead of being reduced to pure nitrogen. 
‘‘A candle-flame is delicate; a moderate puff of 
wind will blow it out. In the bottle, I admit, it 
is sheltered from any current of air, but its weak- 
ness prevents its using up all the gas on which it 
could feed. It turns dim and then goes out alto- 
-* gether when this gas begins to get scarce. If the 
comparison is not too far-fetched, one might call the 
candle-flame a guest at table with a poor appetite, 
leaving on his plate the greater part of the food 
served to him. Let us, then, call in a guest with 
a stronger stomach and able to eat his food to the 
96

    FURTHER EXPERIMENTS WITH AIR 97 
last morsel, leaving nothing but the uneatable, the 
bare bones. I mean, let us find a kind of fuel that 
burns with enough energy to consume all the oxygen 
to the last trace and leave only the useless gas, the 
nitrogen. 
‘‘What shall this fuel be? Shall it be coal? No; 
that would not do any better than candle-grease, 
burning less freely, in fact, because needing the 
heat of a glowing furnace to keep it going, and that 
is out of the question in our experiment, which 
owes more than half of its value to its very simplic- 
ity. Shall it be sulphur? There, assuredly, we 
have a strong stomach needing no second invita- 
tion when oxygen is offered. Once set fire to, it 
burns vigorously. But it has its faults,—its suffo- 
cating fumes. Nevertheless, I should be glad to 
avail myself of it if there were not something better 
at hand. You are familiar enough with the common 
match, the little stick of wood tipped with sulphur, 
and lightly coating the sulphur we find— See who 
can tell me first.’’ 
‘‘Phosphorus!’’ eried the two listeners at the 
same time. 
‘*Yes, phosphorus, which is inflammable to a 
degree not attained by any other substance in com- 
mon use; phosphorus, which takes fire by being 
merely rubbed against the sandpaper cover of the © 
match-box or against a rough wall. Nothing equals 
it in the vigor and persistence with which it 
burns. Here, truly, we have the greedy guest who 
will leave nothing on his plate. But first let us 
get a little better acquainted with him. Phosphorus
-P-A-G-E-106
\ 98 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
is not very well known to you, as hitherto you have 
seen it only on the.tips of matches.’’ 
‘‘Sometimes,’’ said Emile, ‘‘the tips are red, and 
sometimes blue, or yellow, or almost black. Does 
phosphorus have alk those colors?”’ 
‘‘No; of itself phosphorus has only one color, 
which is nearly that of yellow wax. But the match- 
manufacturer adds colored powder, sometimes of 
one hue, sometimes of another, according to his 
fancy, for the sake of giving a little variety to his 
wares and thus pleasing the purchaser’s eye. Glue 
is also mixed with the phosphorus to make it stick 
to the sulphur. So what you are used to seeing 
is not pure phosphorus; but I will show you some 
that is perfectly pure. 
‘‘A few days ago, being called to town on bus- 
iness, I bought a number of things that our labora- 
tory was much in need of. A laboratory, let me 
explain to you, is a place devoted to scientific re- 
search; it is the scientist’s workshop. Modest 
though our workshop is, it must have some equip- 
ment, certain implements and supplies; otherwise we 
should have nothing but our ten fingers for an 
outfit, and what could we do with them? We should 
simply have to content ourselves with talking and 
nothing else. But that I will not have, for I do not 
think much of chemistry carried on in words only. 
I wish to give you facts, things that you can see 
over and over again, substances that you. can feel 
of, taste, examine, handle for yourselves, as that 
is the only true way to learn.

‘‘What could the blacksmith do without his anvil 
and hammer? Nothing. Equally helpless is the 
chemist without the various appliances and drugs 
of his laboratory. We will furnish ours, then, little 
by little, but in a very modest way, I assure you 
beforehand, as your uncle’s resources do not permit 
luxury. We will have the indispensable, but noth- 
ing more. Nor is it altogether a misfortune to be 
thus forced to use one’s wits a little, in devising 
ways and means to make what one has suffice, and in 
getting along without what one does not have. Our 
earthen dish/borrowed from the kitchen, our old 
medicine-bottles and preserve-jars—did they not 
play their part well? I assure you in all sincerity, 
we could not have done better if we had had the 
outfit of a costly laboratory. Why should n’t we 
continue our studies in this way, as far as may be? 
If you ever chance to have access to a real labora- 
tory, and to work in it, my little lads, you will 
take pleasure in recalling your uncle’s poor outfit 
and in reflecting how little it took to lay the 
solid foundations of useful knowledge in your minds, 
and how little it would need to do so for others even 
in our smallest villages. 
‘*It may well happen that we shall be halted now 
and then by difficulties impossible for us to over- 
come; then, and only then, we shall be forced to 
appeal to the expert chemist for aid. Such is our 
position to-day. We had need of phosphorus, and 
here it is, bought recently at the druggist’s in 
town.’’ | LIBRARY

Uncle Paul here set before his nephews a bottle 
holding in water a yellow substance in the form of a 
stick as long and as thick as one’s little finger. 
‘‘That,’’ said he, ‘‘is pure phosphorus. It is 
semi-transparent, which, with its color, makes it 
look like a pretty piece of wax such as we have in the 
honeycomb. It is like wax before being bleached 
at the taper factory by long exposure to the sun.”’ 
‘“Why do you keep it in water?’’ asked Jules. 
‘‘T keep it in water because if exposed to the air 
it would soon eatch fire. So inflammable is it that 
the slightest heat is enough to ignite it.’’ 
‘“But the phosphorus on matches doesn’t catch 
fire like that; you have to scratch it.’’ 
‘*T told you that in matches it is not used in a pure 
state. It is mixed with certain other substances 
with glue and colored powder, which lessen its in- 
flammability. But even so it sometimes occurs in 
summer that matches take fire of their own accord. 
This is a serious fault which, added to others, will 
perhaps some day induce us to give up the use of 
phosphorus, when science has discovered something 
better to take its place.’’ 
‘‘And why,’’ asked Emile, ‘‘does n’t it catch fire 
in the water, if it is so eager to burn?’’ 
‘‘Has Emile forgotten what I told him yester- 
day? In order to have fire, two things are neces- 
sary, each as indispensable as the other,—the thing 
that burns and the thing that makes it burn, this 
latter being a gas called oxygen, contained in the 
air. Combustion is brought about when the two 
combine. Where there is no air—or, rather, where
-P-A-G-E-109
  FURTHER EXPERIMENTS WITH AIR 101 
there is no oxygen—combustion is impossible, how- 
ever inflammable the fuel may be. So I guard the 
phosphorus from risk of taking fire by keeping it in 
water, which protects it from the air. This being 
excluded, we are sure the phosphorus will not catch 
fire. 
‘¢Still another precaution is not out of place with 
this dangerous substance. The bottle holding the 
phosphorus in water might get broken, which would 
expose the phosphorus to the air. Therefore we 
must guard against any chance shock or fall, and to 
this end the bottle is enclosed in a tin box which 
serves as a shock-absorber. In this double en- 
closure and immersed in water, phosphorus is kept 
indefinitely on the druggist’s shelf without any 
danger. 
‘‘It remains for me to add that a burn from 
phosphorus is a serious accident, a most painful 
accident. There is nothing that smarts more than a 
wound made by this terrible stuff. Neither live 
coals nor red-hot iron can cause so acute and last- 
ing a pain. I will leave you to imagine the fate of 
the thoughtless person who, wrapping a piece of 
phosphorus in paper, should put it into his pocket, 
proposing to amuse himself with it later and make 
it shine in the dark. The heat of his body would 
set fire to his perilous possession, and the impru- 
dent one would be burned to his very entrails, while 
he filled the air with his shrieks of agony. Be care- 
ful then, my boys, not to play with this terrible 
substance. If the thirst for knowledge should tempt 
you to handle it at all, do so with the utmost caution.
-P-A-G-E-110

102 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
I appeal here to Emile’s obedience and Jules’s pru- 
dence. Had I not perfect confidence in you, did I 
not know you to be incapable of reckless folly, I 
should double-lock and triple-lock my arsenal of 
drugs and banish phosphorus from our lessons for- 
ever. 
‘‘T should be all the more impelled to this course 
because the risk of fire and serious burns is not the 
only danger to be considered; there is another peril, 
which you must be still more careful to guard 
against. Phosphorus is a deadly poison, a few 
particles of it being enough to cause death with 
frightful sufferings. I will say no more; you are 
warned. Look on phosphorus as one of the most 
formidable of foes, and let no carelessness on your 
part lay you open to its assaults. 
‘‘After these warnings, dictated by prudence, I 
will now explain how phosphorus may be used to 
show what air is made of. We must burn a little 
in a certain volume of air properly separated from 
the rest of the atmosphere. Our container in this 
operation should be of considerable size, so that 
the glass may be far enough from the flame to 
escape the risk of being cracked or broken by the 
heat. A common glass preserve-jar holding two 
liters or more, and as large at the top as at the 
bottom, would do very well if I had not something 
better. This something better is a chemist’s bell- 
glass, a recent purchase of mine, which we shall 
find to be one of the most useful appliances in our 
laboratory. I will ask you to be especially careful 
of it. It is, as you see, a simple container of color-
-P-A-G-E-111
FURTHER EXPERIMENTS WITH AIR _ 1038 
less glass, cylindrical in form, with a dome-shaped 
top surmounted by a little knob for taking hold of. 
Some are made with flaring mouth, reminding one 
of the shape of our bronze church bells, whence 
comes the name of bell-glass. For certain delicate 
plants requiring shelter and warmth gardeners use 
similar glass covers, but they are commonly too 
large and cumbrous for laboratory use. If one could 
find a medium-sized one, it would do perfectly. 
‘*A large bottle, a gardener’s glass plant-pro- 
tector of suitable size, or the ordinary chemist’s 
bell-glass—any one of these that 
should chance to fall into our hands 
would serve as a container for burn- ff , 
ing phosphorus; but Uncle Paul’s | § 
purse has procured for us a real i 
laboratory bell-glass, so let us be 
grateful for it and proceed with 
our experiment. 
‘‘The combustion, the burning of our bit of phos- 
phorus, must take place on water, to prevent any 
communication between the air in the glass and that 
outside. Consequently, the phosphorus has to be 
placed on a tiny raft that will keep it dry, and for 
this purpose we can use any small object that will 
float, as a piece of cork or a bit of wood. But this 
float of ours would catch fire if unprotected from 
the burning phosphorus. Accordingly, we will put 
the latter in a tiny earthenware cup resting on the 
float; and for our cup we will simply take a con- 
cave fragment of some old broken pot. Now all 
is ready and we will proceed to business.      
       
-P-A-G-E-112
  104 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
‘First we must cut off a piece of our stick of 
phosphorus. It is soft enough to cut with a knife, 
being of about the hardness of rather firm wax; but 
it is not a thing to be cut as carelessly as one might 
whittle a stick of pine wood, the mere friction of the 
knife being likely to prove sufficient to set fire to 
the phosphorus if it were exposed to the air, with 
consequent serious injury to the clumsy operator. 
The inflammable stuff should not be held in the air 
except by the finger-tips and for as short a time as 
possible, and the cutting should take place under 
water. Watch me.”’ 
Uncle Paul put his fingers into the bottle and 
drew out the phosphorus stick, which gave out a 
rather strong smell of garlic, with some slight wisps 
of white smoke. The children were told that this 
smell of garlic is the natural odor of phosphorus, 
and that the white smoke would be found to give 
out light if looked at in the dark. Matches emit, 
to a lesser extent, these same odorous fumes. The 
phosphorus was immediately plunged into the bowl 
of water, and there, both hands under water, Uncle 
Paul with a knife cut off a piece about as large as 
two peas. This fragment was placed on a bit of 
broken crockery, and that on a little wooden raft of 
sufficient buoyancy to float its load; then the whole 
thing was set on the surface of the water in the 
middle of the bowl. A lighted match quickly started 
the phosphorus to burning, and Uncle Paul hastened 
to cover it with the bell-glass, which was, of course, 
full of air. ee 
Behold, then, the phosphorus blazing away with  
-P-A-G-E-113
  FURTHER EXPERIMENTS WITH AIR 105 
a violence quite new to the boys, who up to this 
time had seen no more of the inflammable stuff than 
the minute quantity at the tip of a match. The 
flame crackled, the light was brilliant, almost blind- 
ing. A dense cloud of white smoke formed, giving 
the appearance of milk to the contents of the bell- 
glass. At the same time the water in the bowl rose 
so rapidly in the glass that Uncle Paul was obliged 
to add more, in order not to leave the bottom of 
the bowl dry, for that would have let air into the 
bell-glass. So thick was the milky-looking cloud that 
the phosphorus flame could no 
longer be seen; or, if seen, it was 
only at intervals, like lightning 
in a mass of clouds. But the jets 
of light became more and more 
infrequent and feeble, and 
finally ceased altogether. 
*‘Tt is over,’’ Uncle Paul an- 
nounced. ‘‘The phosphorus 
has used up all the oxygen in 
the air contained in the bell-glass, and there is 
nothing left but nitrogen, which will not support 
combustion, although there is still some combustible 
matter left on the bit of crockery. We shall see it 
when the white smoke has cleared away. Mean- 
while let us talk a little about this smoke, which 
seems to attract your attention by reason of its 
_ beautiful milky appearance. It comes from burned 
phosphorus—that is to say, from the phosphorus 
combined with the oxygen of the atmosphere. A 
brilliant light, of such intensity as to try our eyes, 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
,106,, THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
» accompanied this act of combining, as it always does. 
I say nothing of the heat, to which the bit of broken 
crockery could testify if it could speak. These 
fumes are easily dissolved in water, and thus there 
is left a vacant space which the water from the dish 
rises to fill, little by little, in this way showing how 
much oxygen has disappeared. We should have to 
wait only about twenty minutes, more or less, for 
the contents of the glass to become as clear and 
transparent as at the start. But to hasten the proc- 
ess and not to put your patience to such a test, let 
us see what this will do: we shake the bell-glass 
gently so that the moving water washes the interior 
and takes up the smoke. By this operation the con- 
tents will soon be made clear.”’ 
With a little careful management in shaking the 
glass, the gas within was soon made to resume its 
original transparency, and then there was revealed, 
on the bit of broken earthenware, the residue of 
what had been placed there, but now of a reddish 
color and, indeed, so changed in appearance that 
the boys would not have recognized it as phos- 
phorus. Melted by the heat so that it was spread 
out on the piece of earthenware, it had quite an 
altered look. But to convince his hearers that it 
was still phosphorus, their uncle tilted the bell-glass 
slightly, so as to bring the little raft near its edge, 
when it became an easy matter to withdraw the raft 
and its load. 
‘‘What we have here,’’ said he, ‘‘is really phos- 
phorus despite the reddish tinge that heat and melt- 
ing have given it. There is even more left over
-P-A-G-E-115
    FURTHER EXPERIMENTS WITH AIR 107 
than there was burned. You shall judge for your- 
selves.”’ 
The potsherd was taken out into the garden so 
as not to mingle the disagreeable phosphorus fumes 
with the air of the workroom, then with a match 
the reddish substance was set fire to, and it burned 
with the bright light and dense white smoke attend- 
ing the combustion under glass. Thus it was proved 
that there remained some phosphorus, even a good 
deal, as it burned for a considerable time; and in 
this instance every particle of it was consumed, the 
last trace being dissipated in the air as white smoke. 
‘‘Tf combustion stopped under the bell-glass,’’ 
Uncle Paul continued, ‘‘it was not for lack of some- 
thing to burn, for there was a good deal of it left at 
the end, but for lack of the gas necessary to sup- 
port combustion—oxygen, in a word. It stopped 
when the last trace of this gas was used up, phos- 
phorus being able to burn as long as there is any 
oxygen left, however little it may be. Consequently, 
the bell-glass now contains nothing but pure nitro- 
gen, a gas in which no substance whatever can 
burn. 
‘‘The phosphorus experiment tells us once again, 
but more positively and more distinctly, what the 
candle experiment told us: the atmosphere contains _ 
two gases, oxygen, which supports combustion, and 
nitrogen, in which neither candle nor phosphorus 
nor anything else can burn. It tells us, also, in 
what proportions the two gases, both simple sub- 
stances, both metalloids, are combined in the atmos- 
phere. Our bell-glass is cylindrical. If we divide
-P-A-G-E-116
108 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
its height into five equal parts, these will represent 
equal capacities, equal volumes. Now we see that 
the water that rose in the glass and took the place 
of the departed oxygen has mounted to a fifth of 
the total height, nitrogen occupying the other four- 
fifths. Thus the air about us has four times as 
much nitrogen as oxygen; or, to express it differ- 
ently, in five liters of air there are four of nitrogen 
and one of oxygen. 
‘“We will stop here for to-day. To-morrow, let 
me notify you in advance, our chemical experiments 
will call for two live and uninjured sparrows. Set 
your snares and catch them. I must ask you also 
to be careful not to molest any of the various species 
of garden birds, industrious hunters of insects and 
worms that are the scourge of agriculture; but I 
gladly give you a free rein in regard to those pil- 
laging sparrows that, eager to find some tender 
foliage to tickle their palates in the spring, fly down 
from the neighboring roofs and nip my peas as fast 
as they sprout. I must have two of these birds for 
our instruction and to serve as a lesson to their

    CHAPTER Ix 
THE TWO SPARROWS 
HE two sparrows had been eaught. Spring- 
traps, hidden under a thin layer of earth 
amid the rows of sprouting peas, and each baited 
with a piece of bread, had soon accomplished their 
purpose. Extricated from their entanglement in 
time to prevent strangling, the two captives were 
now moving about, full of life, in a cage. The boys 
were impatient to know what their uncle proposed 
to do with them, eagerly looking forward to some 
highly interesting and important experiment. A 
course of study having for them the keenest inter- 
est, and carrying with it the fun of catching spar- 
rows, was real play in their eyes,—a circumstance 
highly pleasing to their uncle, who was convinced 
that in order to learn well one must enjoy learning. 
‘‘Hiver since yesterday,’’ said he to them, ‘‘the 
bell-glass full of gas, in which, the phosphorus would 
no longer burn, has been standing in the bowl of 
water. The white smoke left after the experiment, 
and of which a little might have continued to linger 
all the afternoon, has now had ample time to dis- 
appear, to become absorbed in the water, so that at 
present there is nothing in the glass but perfectly 
pure nitrogen. Notice the transparency, the com- 
109

  110 ‘THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
o Se piity, of this gas. Would n’t you take it 
for ordinary air, air such as filled the bell-glass in 
the beginning? It looks just the same, and yet how 
different are its properties! In this gas nothing 
will burn, no matter what we try. After what has 
occurred, this is plain enough without further 
demonstration. Some phosphorus—a good deal of 
it, in fact—was left inside the bell-glass, as was 
proved when we burned this residue out in the 
garden. If this remnant of phosphorus could not 
burn under the glass, but did burn very readily in 
the open air, the reason must be that it no longer 
had around it the gas needed to support combus- 
tion, having consumed what was originally con- 
tained in the bell-glass. In the open air is found 
an unlimited supply of what it had lacked under 
the glass, and that is why it began to burn again 
more brightly than ever and continued to do so 
until the last particle of the phosphorus was used up. 
‘‘Hence it is plain enough that as phosphorus 
could not go on burning in the gas now remaining 
in the bell-glass, no other substance whatever can 
burn there. Where the most inflammable of sub- 
stances stops burning how could one less inflam- 
mable remain on fire?’’ 
‘‘That is very clear,’’ admitted Jules; ‘‘what the 
strongest cannot do, certainly the weakest cannot. 
Then this gas—this nitrogen, as you call it—would 
immediately quench any fire that could be plunged 
into it?”’ 
‘‘Oertainly. No burning substance plunged into 
it could go on burning for a single moment.”’
-P-A-G-E-119
  THE TW®@ SPARROWS “111 
‘‘Tt would be the same as when the candle stopped 
burning in the bottle? Emile, with all his care, 
could n’t make it stay alight.’’ 
‘‘Yes, that ’s it, except that it falls short of the 
truth. I told you a candle-flame hasn’t energy 
enough to use all the oxygen in the air. A con- 
siderable part is left over in any such experiment 
as we performed at first; that is to say, in the 
experiment with the candle burning inside the bottle 
turned upside down, what is left of the gas is not 
pure nitrogen; there is still a little oxygen mixed 
with it, but not enough to keep a second candle alight 
where the first one ceased to burn. We found, in 
fact, that we could n’t put a lighted candle in there 
without its going out immediately. But a more in- + 
flammable substance, such as phosphorus, would find 
what it needed in the residue of oxygen there, and 
would go on burning for some time where the candle 
could not.”’ 
‘‘One might, then, put it this way,’’ suggested 
Jules: ‘‘phosphorus is so hungry for oxygen that 
it licks up the leavings of the candle, which has a 
more delicate appetite.’’ 
‘¢Ves, that would express it admirably. If there 
are any remnants of oxygen, phosphorus, with its 
robust appetite, will be sure to devour them; but if 
there are no such leavings, it must go without, and 
in that case it ceases to burn just as any other 
combustible material would have to do.”’ 
‘“That seems clear enough,’’ said Emile, in his 
turn; ‘‘but, all the same, I should like to see it 
proved by experiment.’’
-P-A-G-E-120
  112 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
‘“What you desire is exactly what I propose to 
do,’’ replied his uncle; ‘‘only we must first transfer 
a little of the gas from the bell-glass to a wide- 
mouthed bottle, in which our tests can be made more 
conveniently. So now is the time for us to put into 
practice the little I have told you about the trans- 
fusion of gases. As our bowl is too small and too 
shallow for this purpose, we will use this large tub 
filled with water.’’ 
So saying, Uncle Paul lowered the bowl with the 
bell-glass into the tub without disarranging them, 
and as soon as the rim of the glass was immersed 
he withdrew the bowl. A wide-mouthed bottle full 
of water, inverted and with only its mouth im- 
mersed, was held in position by Jules. His uncle 
tilted the bell-glass a little, and made some of the 
gas pass into the bottle and fill it. Then the bowl 
was again slipped under the bell-glass, and the whole 
thing was replaced on the table. Finally, the bottle, _ 
filled with nitrogen and stopped with the palm of 
the hand, was set upright on the table and a piece 
of glass laid over its mouth. In these various op- 
erations, harder to describe than to execute, care 
was taken never to leave the containers of nitrogen 
open to the outer air, an indispensable precaution 
and one easy to observe by keeping their mouths 
immersed and operating under water. 
s— *‘Here we have our bottle full of nitrogen,’’ said 
Uncle Paul. ‘‘Now what shall we try first,—sul- 
phur, phosphorus, or candle?’’ 
‘‘Let ’s begin with the weakest,’’ was Emile’s 
suggestion, ‘‘and try the candle first.’’
-P-A-G-E-121
THE TWO SPARROWS 113 
The candle, tied to a wire, was lighted and slowly 
let down into the bottle. Scarcely had it passed 
the mouth when it suddenly went completely out, 
not retaining even for an instant that red glow on 
the wick which is wont to linger for some time after 
the candle-flame has been blown out. A plunge into 
water could not have caused a more instantaneous 
and complete extinction. 
‘‘Ha!’’ cried Emile, ‘‘that goes much better than 
when we tried it before. Yesterday the flame 
seemed to hesitate, sometimes, about going out; it 
had to be let down well into the bottle, and the wick 
appeared to want to keep its red spot; but to-day 
we see nothing of the sort. As soon as the candle 
was lowered into the neck of the bottle, flame and 
red spot both vanished at the same time. And 
now let ’s try phosphorus.”’ 
‘Phosphorus will not burn there any better; you 
shall see.’’ 
The fragment of broken crockery again served 
as a cup the size of a five-frane piece. An iron wire 
was bent at one end into a ring for holding this 
cup, which in turn was to hold the piece of phos- 
phorus. These arrangements completed, the phos- 
phorus was first lighted, and then lowered by means 
of the iron wire into the bottle of nitrogen. It 
went out abruptly, as had been expected. What 
burned so furiously outside the bottle immediately 
refused to burn when put inside. 
A similar test was made with sulphur, which 
Emile seemed to think might burn in the bottle be- 
cause of its high inflammability; but it went out
-P-A-G-E-122
114 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
as quickly as the candle and the phosphorus. 
‘‘Wurther tests are needless,’’ declared Uncle 
Paul; ‘‘they would only lead to the same result. 
Nothing can burn in nitrogen; or, in other words, 
that gas will not support combustion. 
‘‘So now we will proceed to make use of your 
two sparrows, whose part in our study of chemistry 
is still a puzzle to you. They will teach us some 
very interesting things, to atone in part for our loss 
in the peas they have destroyed. ‘In the first place, 
we must fill our bottle once more with nitrogen. 
What is still there has come into contact with phos- 
phorus, sulphur, and candle-grease; therefore we 
are not certain that it is perfectly pure, as it should 
be for the purpose of our experiment. Accordingly, 
we will obtain a fresh supply from the bell-glass, 
first emptying out what is already in the bottle. 
But how shall we proceed to accomplish this?’’ 
‘“To empty a bottle, all you have to do is to turn 
it upside down,’’ Emile made haste to explain, with- 
out stopping to think. 
‘*Yes, if the bottle contained water or some other 
liquid,’’ replied his uncle; ‘‘but it contains a gas 
of about the same weight as air. If you should try 
to empty a bottle of air by turning it upside down, 
you would never succeed.’’ 
‘‘That ’s so. Then let ’s blow as hard as we 
can into the bottle, and we shall drive out what is in 
i 
‘Agreed; but first tell me how we are to know 
when we have driven it all out, there being nothing 
to show what goes out and what comes in. Further-

more, you will only replace the first gas with an- | 
other, your breath, which will be just as hard to 
drive out; and so the thing will have to be done all 
over again, and after that still again, and so on 
without end.’’ 
‘‘Really, the more I think of it, the harder it 
looks to me. I was a little too hasty when I said 
it was so easy to do. Jules says never a word, and 
I ’ll bet he doesn’t know any better than I how 
to manage it.’’ 
‘“‘T own I am puzzled,’’ said Jules. ‘‘This little 
matter, which seemed a mere nothing, brings me up 
short.’’ 
‘‘Tt will not stop you very long. Here is how 
it is done.”’ 
His uncle took the bottle and plunged it into the 
tub, where it quickly filled with water. 
‘‘There you have the gas driven out completely.’’ 
‘*Ves,’’ agreed the boys, ‘‘but now the bottle is 
full of water.’’ 
‘¢And what is to prevent our replacing it with 
nitrogen from the bell-glass just as we did before?”’ 
‘‘Why, that ’s so! It’s as easy as can be. The 
only hard part was to think of it in the first place, 
just as you said yesterday.”’ 
‘‘T am reminded at this point,’’ said Uncle Paul, 
‘‘of something that may appropriately be mentioned 
here. In order to ascertain whether the composition 
of the air is everywhere the same, aéronauts and 
travelers sometimes bring back air taken at the 
height they have reached. Now, how can a sample 
of air be taken at the summit of Mont Blane, for in-
-P-A-G-E-124
  116 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
stance, or in the lofty altitudes attained by balloon- 
ists? How make sure that the air really comes 
from precisely such and such a place, from a given 
mountain-top, for example, or from a certain height 
in the heavens above? Imagine a series of bottles 
labeled: ‘This is from the top of Mount Perdu,’ 
‘This was taken at a height of eight thousand 
meters, by an aéronaut,’ ‘This was brought by vessel 
from such and such a latitude and longitude at 
sea.” How are specimens to be obtained from vari- 
ous distant points when they are desired for the 
purpose of chemical examination? Nothing easier. 
A bottle filled with water is emptied at the exact 
spot where it is proposed to take a sample of the 
air, and the air at this spot rushes in to take the 
place of the liquid poured out. Then the bottle, 
carefully corked, will hold henceforth, with no 
further precautions, the invisible substance that 
at first seemed so hard to collect in perfect purity. 
‘We now come to the sparrows, whose part in all 
this I see you are impatient to learn. From the 
contents of the bell-glass I once more fill our bottle 
with nitrogen in the manner already shown. A 
~ second bottle of the same size and shape, but full of 
air, is placed on the table beside the first. There 
they both are, with pieces of glass over their 
mouths as stoppers. In the appearance of their 
contents there is no difference, each bottle showing 
the same clearness, the same invisibility, as to what 
is inside. Now I will put these two sparrows into 
our bottles, which are large enough to hold them 
for the short time required by the experiment. But 
 
-P-A-G-E-125
THE TWO SPARROWS 117 
first I will ask Emile which bottle, if he were a bird, 
he would prefer to go into, the one with air or the 
one with nitrogen.’’ 
‘*A week ago,’’ replied the boy, ‘‘I should have 
said it didn’t matter which I chose, for there is 
nothing to be seen in the one any more than in the 
other; but now, to tell the truth, I ’m beginning to 
be afraid of these invisible things. That rascally 
nitrogen that puts out a candle is not to be trusted. 
I don’t know much about it, and I do know a little 
more about air, and so I ’d rather trust air than 
nitrogen. If I were a sparrow, then, I ’d choose the 
bottle filled with air.’’ 
‘‘And you would choose very 
wisely, as you shall soon see.’’ 
Taken from the temporary cage, 
the sparrows were put, one into the 
bottle full of air, the other into the 
bottle of nitrogen. The piece of 
glass laid over the mouth of each “se > 
bottle shut in its occupant completely. "The young 
observers looked on, deeply interested in what was 
to come next. In the bottle of air nothing unusual 
occurred. The captive fluttered about, pecking at 
its prison-wall of glass, that mysterious obstruction 
which it could not see and yet could not pass through. 
It tried to take flight, fell back, rose again, and 
recommenced its vain attempts. All this was 
simply the agitation of a bird seeking to regain its 
lost liberty, a desperate attempt to escape from the 
prison, and nothing more. Vigorously alive, 
struggling with beak, claw, and wing, the bird 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
118 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
evidently had no other feeling than one of extreme 
fright. 
Quite otherwise did the sparrow in the bottle filled 
with nitrogen behave. No sooner was it placed in 
its glass cage than it was overcome as if with stupor. 
Staggering, beak open, breast heaving, it appeared 
almost at its last gasp. ‘Seized with convulsions, 
it fell sidewise, struggled aimlessly, opened its beak 
again and again as it panted for breath, and then 
ceased to move. The bird was dead. The other, on 
the contrary, was still comporting itself in a very 
Nively fashion. 
‘<This experiment,’’ Uncle Paul 
confessed, ‘‘is one that I have no 
liking for; nor does it please you 
any better, my dear children. The 
sight of a creature in pain, suffer- 
ing as the victim of our curiosity, 
like this sparrow dying to afford 
: us instruction, is as repugnant to 
your . kindly nature as itis to mine. It is a thing to 
see once, the pursuit of knowledge having its cruel 
necessities; but it is not to be repeated. Let us 
hasten to liberate the survivor. For the sake of its 
fellow, dead in the cause of chemistry, I fOnEye it 
for pilfering my peas.”’ 
The two sparrows were taken out of the bottles, 
the one from that containing air being as lively 
as a cricket. Emile held it in his hand a moment, 
bade it good-by, took it to the open window, and let 
it go, whereupon it flew away like an arrow, with a 
cry of supreme joy. The other, its poor little claws 
 
-P-A-G-E-127
  THE TWO SPARROWS 119 
stiff in death, remained on the table, breast upward. 
Emile and Jules gave it occasional side glances, 
puzzled to understand the cause of so sudden a 
death, and perhaps hoping to see it come back to life. 
Their uncle perceived what was in their minds. 
‘‘To not hope for the sparrow’s revival,’’ said 
he. ‘‘It is dead—poor little thing aque for good 
and all.’’ . 
‘‘Ts this nitrogen, then, week a terrible poison?’’ 
asked Jules. 
‘‘No, my young friend. Far from being a poison, 
nitrogen is perfectly harmless. It must be harm- 
less or we could not live in an atmosphere of which 
it constitutes four fifths. We all breathe it inces- 
santly, and not one of us ever has any reason to 
complain of it. Nitrogen is quite harmless; that is 
not what killed the bird.”’ 80 
‘<Then why did it die?’’ 
‘‘The candle which burns in the air goes out in 
nitrogen. Is it because of this gas? No, for if 
that were so, the candle could not burn in an atmos- 
phere abounding in nitrogen. Where this gas is 
present all by itself the candle goes out, not on 
account of the nitrogen, but because it lacks the 
element essential to combustion, and that is oxygen. 
It is not the presence of the one gas, but the absence 
of the other, that makes combustion impossible. 
‘¢We ourselves perish quickly in water. Why? 
Can it be that water is a poison? Certainly not; 
such an idea would never occur to us. We die in 
the water for want of air, water itself having noth- 
ing to do with the death of the person drowned, 
   
-P-A-G-E-128
  120 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
which is due solely to the lack of breathable air. 
In like manner we may say the sparrow met its 
death by drowning in nitrogen. It cannot truly be 
said that air was wholly lacking, for the bird had a 
plenty of one of the two gases composing the atmos- 
phere; it was merely deprived of that part which 
alone is breathable, which alone promotes in the 
animal, for the purpose of sustaining life, an action 
comparable in every way to that set up in the 
candle-flame to cause it to burn. 
‘“Tt is the lack of oxygen, then, that caused the 
sparrow’s death and the going out of the candle. 
Where there is no oxygen, neither life nor combus- 
tion is possible. No animal can live where a candle 
cannot burn, for life and combustion are closely 
akin, as I will show you at the proper time. But 
first we must study carefully this partner of nitro- 
gen in our atmosphere, this gas called oxygen; and 
then you will be in a position to see the close re- 
semblance between life and fire.”’ 
The boys exchanged glances of surprise at hear- 
ing their uncle thus associate these two things. 
‘‘T am saying nothing,’’ he continued, ‘‘that does 
not agree with the most careful scientific observa- 
tions; that has not, indeed, to some extent, become 
a part of our every-day thinking, so obvious is it to 
every one. We say of a fire that has gone out, that 
it is dead. The famous song that Harlequin sings 
under his friend Pierrot’s window tells us that the 
candle is dead. In order to die it must first have 
lived. The dead fire, the dead candle, had, while 
they burned, I will not say life, for that would be  
-P-A-G-E-129
      THE TWO SPARROWS 121 
going too far, but at least a state not unlike life in 
respect to the chemical action concerned. <A lighted 
candle and a live animal consume oxygen in order 
to continue burning in the one case and living in 
the other. Both candle-flame and animal die in 
nitrogen because this oxygen is lacking there. That 
is the whole secret of the end of the poor sparrow.’’ 
‘‘And other animals?’’ asked Emile. ‘‘Would ° 
they die in the nitrogen as the sparrow did?”’ 
‘All would die there, some sooner, some later, 
according to their different kinds—absolutely all, 
since no creature, however small, can live without 
oxygen, for which nitrogen will not in the least serve 
as a substitute. If it were not a cruelty as repug- 
nant as it would be useless, we might repeat our 
experiment with all the inhabitants of our garden,— 
with its birds, field-mice, moles, insects, snails, and 
so on,—and we should see them all succumb in nitro- 
gen, some quickly, others after a long enough time 
to try our patience; for I must tell you that though 
all animals without exception need oxygen if they 
are to live, they do not all feel its need with equal 
urgency. There are some that are overpowered 
instantly in nitrogen: such was the case with our 
sparrow; others can live in it for hours or even for 
days, but are sure to die at last. The rule is uni- 
versal; the length of the victim’s resistance alone 
varies. First to succumb are the birds, their 
breathing being very rapid. Then follow the fur- 
bearing animals,—the cat, the dog, the rabbit, ete.,— 
in short, the mammals, as naturalists call them. 
Reptiles have a much greater power of resistance:
-P-A-G-E-130
122 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
a lizard, a snake, or a frog would perhaps not be 
quite dead even at the end of an hour. Finally, 
insects, snails, and other small forms of animal 
life are the last to perish. 
‘‘This is something so important that I must not 
refuse to illustrate it by experiment, despite our 
pity for suffering. Besides, I have in mind a poor 
victim that would otherwise perish miserably under 
the cat’s claws. Better that it should meet with 
a gentle death in nitrogen than endure the cruel 
suffering the cat’s claws would inflict. We shall be 
doing it a kindness to spare it that torture. It is 
a mouse caught in the mouse-trap. I saw it this 
morning on one of the pantry shelves. Emile, go 
and get it.’’ 
Emile came back with the mouse-trap and its 
captive. From the nitrogen left in the bell-glass, 
the bottle in which the sparrow had died was re- 
filled. Opening the trap a little, Uncle Paul dropped 
the mouse into the bottle. Finding itself in this 
glass prison, the animal first circled around several 
times, hugging the wall and seeking an outlet, with 
no further appearance of discomfort than fright. 
Then it crouched down, began to tremble, and 
seemed to go to sleep. Finally, a sudden convul- 
sion announced that it was dead. Only a few 
minutes had passed, but it was clear that the animal 
had taken longer to die than the bird. 
‘‘Give the mouse to the cat,’’ said Uncle Paul, 
‘‘and that shall end our experiments with animals. 
Now let us sum up what we have just learned. 
_ Nitrogen forms four fifths of our atmosphere. It

CHAPTER X 
BURNING PHOSPHORUS 
REPARATIONS had been made for some 
new experiments, which pupils always like. 
On the table stood the tin box containing the bottle 
with the phosphorus; also there was the famous 
bell-glass resting on a plate, in the middle of which 
was a saucer full of lime. 
‘‘What is Uncle going to show us with all these 
fixings?’’ queried the boys. 
‘‘The air we breathe,’’ he began, ‘‘is still very 
imperfectly known to you. Of the two elements 
composing it, only one, nitrogen, has been shown 
you; the other, oxygen, less abundant but. much 
more important, is hardly known to you except by 
name. You recall what the experiment with burn- 
ing phosphorus showed us,—that oxygen forms the 
fifth part of our atmosphere,—and you also know, 
rather from my telling you than from the evidence 
of actual facts, that it is the gas needed when any- 
thing is to be burned. Without oxygen the flame 
goes out, and without it the life of an animal also 
comes to anend. But what is this gas? What will 
it do alone, by itself, and not mixed with nitrogen 
as it is in the atmosphere? That, my little friends, 
124
-P-A-G-E-133
  
BURNING PHOSPHORUS 125 
is the important question. I am aad to try to 
answer it for you. 
‘In five liters of atmospheric air there are four 
_ liters of nitrogen and one of oxygen; so that is the 
source we must go to when we wish to obtain in a 
pure state either one of these two elements. Now, 
in the atmosphere the two gases are not chemically 
- combined, but simply mixed, as I shall have occasion 
to prove to you later. As-they are only mixed, a 
simple separation of the two is all that is needed, 
though even this is a difficult matter; for how 
can we separate two substances that cannot be 
handled or even seen? A little while ago when we 
mixed powdered sulphur and iron filings, Emile 
thought it not impossible to separate the two, grain 
by grain, at a great cost of time and patience. And 
he was right: the task is not too much for nimble 
fingers and sharp eyes. With this mixture called 
air, however, it is a very different thing. The two 
substances forming the mixture can be neither seen 
nor felt, and if they could be seen it would still be 
hardly any easier to separate them, so subtle is their 
nature. What, then, are we to do?’’ 
‘‘Tt was easy enough to separate iron and sul- 
phur,’’ said Jules, after a moment’s reflection, ‘‘by 
using a magnet, even though the two substances 
were both of them powdered very fine. Could n’t 
we use some means for sorting the two gases that 
air is made of?’’ 
— **Veg,’? chimed in Emile, ‘‘I ’d like to find some- 
thing that we could hold in the air and make it 
attract one of the gases and leave the other behind,
-P-A-G-E-134
126 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
just as the magnet attracted the iron filings and left 
. the sulphur.’’ ? 
‘‘Do you know, my lads, that what you say shows 
more understanding of the matter than I had ex- 
pected?’’ rejoined Uncle Paul. ‘‘Your answers de- 
light me, anticipating as they do what I was about 
to propose as the only practicable means to be em- 
ployed. What Emile says he would like to find is 
already known to you; you have seen it in operation, 
and no longer ago than day before yesterday.’’ 
‘¢Phosphorus?’’ queried the boys. 
‘Yes, phosphorus. When it was burned under 
the bell-glass, did it not take to itself the oxygen and 
leave its companion, nitrogen, in the glass?’’ 
‘‘Yes, that ’s just what it did.’’ 
‘Did n’t it behave very much like the magnet you 
thrust into the mixture of iron filings and sulphur 
so that it drew the iron filings to itself and left the 
sulphur on the paper?’’ 
‘‘To be sure it did!”’ 
‘“‘The magnet attracts iron, but has no effect on 
sulphur, which is thus left by itself. In the same 
way burning phosphorus attracts and retains the 
oxygen in the air, but leaves the nitrogen, for which 
it has no liking.’’ 
‘‘Now we have it, I think,’’ said Jules. ‘‘The 
magnet, covered with iron filings, was drawn out 
of the mixture, and then we rubbed off the filings 
on to another piece of paper away from the sulphur. 
Let ’s make the phosphorus take all the oxygen it 
wants, and then we ’ll take it away again.”? 
‘‘A capital suggestion,’’ applauded Uncle Paul; 
 
-P-A-G-E-135
BURNING PHOSPHORUS 127 
‘‘but, unfortunately, it won’t quite work. The 
magnet readily gives up its load of filings, but not 
so with phosphorus and its load of oxygen. I have 
told you of its voracious appetite. Once having got 
its fill of oxygen, it is impossible to make it disgorge 
except by forcible means not at our command in our 
humble laboratory. What it gets it keeps a good 
hold of, so that with our modest resources we should 
never succeed in making it let go.”’ 
‘‘Let it keep its oxygen, then!’’ cried Jules in 
vexation at seeing his project fail just as he thought 
it about to succeed. ‘‘I ’ll try another way. Isn’t 
there something that will work just the opposite 
of phosphorus,—something that will take the nitro- 
gen from the air and leave the oxygen alone by it- 
self? That would be much simpler.’’ 
‘‘No doubt that would be much simpler, but—’’ 
‘Ts there a but?”’ 
‘‘Alas, yes, and a most serious one! You must 
know that nitrogen is a most unsociable element, 
decidedly hostile to the notion of alliances. No ele- 
ment will have anything to do with it, as a rule, and 
it has no use for a partner of any sort. Chemical 
combination it abhors, and only when coaxed by the 
most skilful and delicate devices will it consent to 
any such union. Let us not, then, for a moment 
think of withdrawing nitrogen from the air by com- 
bining it with another substance; all attempts in that 
direction would be sure to result in failure. 
‘‘Must we, then, give up in despair? Not at all. 
The first method is excellent if we only use it with 
discretion. Phosphorus, it is true, keeps a most
-P-A-G-E-136
128. THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
obstinate hold on the gas it has united with in the 
act of burning, and it is useless to expect it to let 
go of the oxygen it has taken from the air. But, 
fortunately, not all simple substances are like it. 
We shall find some more accommodating, willing to 
surrender their plunder without too much coaxing. 
For to-day we will content ourselves with learning 
how this gas is accumulated and, as we might say, 
stored up in a burnt substance; and for the pur- 
poses of this demonstration phosphorus will serve. 
‘“You have not forgotten how smoke formed in 
the bell-glass when phosphorus was burned there, 
in our experiment of day before yesterday. That 
thick cloud of milk-white appearance made too deep 
an impression on you to be soon forgotten. And 
you remember how, little by little, it dispersed, be- 
ing taken up by the water in the bowl. If I had not 
called your attention to this point, perhaps that dis- 
appearance would have seemed to you a real instance 
of annihilation, and you would have retained the 
notion, so generally held, that fire reduces to nothing 
the material that it burns. I instructed you to the 
contrary, but that is not enough; I wish to add to 
my mere assertion the more convincing testimony 
of fact. Accordingly, I propose to show you that 
fire does not annihilate, but only transforms; that 
it changes the appearance and the properties of 
matter without affecting its existence. Phosphorus 
will furnish us a fine example of this, and at the 
same time give us some knowledge of the chief topic 
of our to-day’s lesson. The experiment I am pro- 
posing will show us, on the one hand, the indestructi-

   BURNING PHOSPHORUS 129: 
bility of matter by fire, and, on the other, the stor- 
ing up of oxygen by combustion. 
‘“‘The white fumes given out by burning phos- 
phorus are very easily dissolved in water, which ac- 
counts for their prompt disappearance in our recent 
experiment. To preserve them, to let them take 
on the state natural to them when cold, and then to 
examine them at leisure, it is absolutely necessary to 
do the burning where there is no water. Nor is 
even this precaution sufficient, so great is the liking 
for water of this compound formed by burning phos- 
phorus. The atmosphere is always moist, whence 
come rain and dew. However dry it may seem to 
us, it is sure to contain more or less of the invisible 
- vapor of water, which the burned phosphorus would 
greedily pounce upon, dissolving itself therein just 
as sugar dissolves in water. Consequently, we must 
have perfectly dry air in the bell-glass where the 
burning is to take place. 
‘“‘This dry air I obtain by means of quicklime,— 
that is to say, lime before it is slaked by the mason, 
or, in other words, lime just as it comes from the 
lime-kiln where it has been prepared. You don’t 
need to be told what happens to a piece of lime left 
in the air for some time.’’ 
‘‘T know what you mean,’’ said Jules. ‘‘The piece 
of lime gradually cracks open, and then crumbles 
to dust, just as it does when you sprinkle it with 
water; only then it crumbles a good deal faster.”’ 
‘‘That is it. Sprinkled with water, a piece of 
lime eracks, splits, crumbles to dust. Exposed to 
the air for some time, it acts in the same way, but
-P-A-G-E-138
  130. THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
more slowly. Why? Because it absorbs the mois- 
ture in the surrounding air, until, little by little, this 
moisture has had the same effect on it as a fine spray 
of water would have had. Thus it is that lime has 
the habit of attracting moisture, however little there 
may be within its reach. It wrenches it by foree, 
we might say, from the surrounding atmosphere, 
and takes every bit of it. Here we have, then, a 
very easy and convenient way to obtain perfectly 
dry air. 
‘‘A few hours ago I took care to place a saucer 
of quicklime in the middle of a large plate, and 
-eovered it with the bell-glass, the latter resting on 
the plate and being, of course, full of air. With 
this precaution the fumes of the burning phosphorus 
cannot escape, and not only the imprisoned air, but 
also the surface of the plate under the glass and 
the inside of the glass itself, will be rendered very 
dry. Now for the burning of our phosphorus.’’ 
Uncle Paul cut off a piece of this substance under 
water and dried it carefully with blotting-paper. 
Then, placing it on a bit of broken crockery, he with- 
drew the saucer full of lime and substituted the 
phosphorus, which he set fire to, whereupon the bell- 
glass with its contents of dry air was immediately 
replaced on the plate. The burning did not at first 
differ in any way from that already seen by the 
boys; there was the same bright light, with the same 
eddies of dense white smoke. But at this point 
there occurred something new: on the inside of the 
cold glass the smoke condensed and became a beau- 
tiful, white, flaky substance that detached itself and 
 
-P-A-G-E-139
BURNING PHOSPHORUS 131 
fell here and there with all the appearance of falling 
snow. Soon the plate was covered with a layer of 
this strange snow-like substance that had come from — 
the very heart of the flames. 
‘Well, Emile,’’ said his uncle, ‘‘what do you 
think of this snow?’’ 
‘‘T think it is very wonderful. Who would ever 
have expected fire to make a»snow-storm! But I 
know well enough it isn’t real snow, though one 
might be fooled by its looks. Those flakes, all so 
white and beautiful, must come from the burning 
phosphorus, for they could n’t come from anything 
else.’’ 
‘“Yes, that is quite clear. The substance we see 
forming here has nothing of snow about it except its 
appearance. In reality it is quite another thing, 
as we shall soon see. But first let us make it snow 
a little more. The fire is dying down; we will feed 
a? 
Uncle Paul raised the bell-glass a little, and the 
burning, which had begun to languish, started up 
again with all its former vigor. 
‘‘Air was beginning to fail,’’ said he; ‘‘the phos- 
phorus had nearly exhausted its supply of gas, and 
was about to die down, but, by raising the bell-glass 
a little, I have let in more air, and the fire revives. 
Let us give it a little more air still, so that we may 
be sure to have enough of this strange snow.’’ 
When, after three or four renewals of air, the 
layer of snow on the plate was deemed thick enough, 
Uncle Paul took a pair of pincers and drew out the 
piece of crockery with the phosphorus on it and 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
1832 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
carried it into the garden, that the still unconsumed 
material might there burn itself out with no incon- 
venience to lungs or sense of smell. 
‘‘Now, my young friends,’’ he resumed, ‘‘I invite 
you to examine what there is in the plate. It is, as 
you see, a white, flaky substance looking much like 
snow. That is what phosphorus turns to when 
burned. Fire has not destroyed it, but has changed 
it into something else, and the change is so complete 
that if you did not know where this false snow came 
from you could never guess its nature. I repeat, 
fire does not destroy anything; what it devours, 
what it consumes, is not reduced to nothing, but 
changed into something else, which sometimes van- 
ishes from before our eyes as an invisible gas, and at 
other times arrests even the least heedful attention 
as a much grosser substance. What you see here 
in the plate—this stuff that we can feel, smell, and 
taste—is phosphorus consumed by fire, phosphorus 
still in existence though it has been burnt up. Thus 
is illustrated before your eyes the first point I had in 
view in this experiment,—namely, that nothing is 
ever annihilated even by the action of fire. | 
‘‘Suppose we had here a fine pair of scales for 
weighing, exactly balanced as are scales used by 
chemists, and capable of telling us with precision 
the weight of a fly’s wing. The weighing of even 
so minute a bit of matter is very often called for in 
the delicate operations of chemistry. With a pair 
of scales of such sensitiveness, we could have ascer- 
tained the weight of the piece of phosphorus in milli- 
grams. Nothing then would have stood in the way 
 
-P-A-G-E-141
  BURNING PHOSPHORUS 133 
of our burning the whole of that piece under the 
bell-glass by renewing the air as often as was neces- 
sary; and at the end we could have taken a feather 
and swept up the snowy deposit even to the last 
flake, after which we could have weighed it on our 
scales. Let us suppose these two weighings to have 
been carried out, one before the phosphorus was 
burned and the other after. Now, which will weigh 
the more, the unburnt substance or the burnt? 
‘‘Misled by that false notion of fire as a destroyer, 
the novice would answer at once that the burnt sub- 
stance would weigh less than the other, arguing that 
if fire does not entirely destroy, it at least destroys 
in part. But you, my boys, forewarned against this 
error in our earlier talks, and having had your eyes 
opened by a number of experiments, will not, I be- 
lieve, make this foolish answer.’’ 
‘*T should think not,’’ was the sepbidenk reply of 
Jules. ‘‘I should say the burnt phosphorus would 
be heavier than the unburnt.”’ 
‘‘Your reason, my lad. Let us make no asser- 
tions without proof to support them.’’ 
‘<The reason is plain enough,’”’ said Jules. ‘‘You 
told us and proved to us that when anything is 
burned it combines with something in the air called 
oxygen. Although an invisible gas, this oxygen is 
matter, and consequently has some weight, if only 
a very little. So that burnt phosphorus, having had 
' oxygen added to it, ought to weigh more than phos- 
phorus alone.”’ 
‘Golden Mouth could not have said it better,’’ 
applauded Uncle Paul. ‘‘Yes, my young friend, the 
 
-P-A-G-E-142
  1384 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
burnt phosphorus must weigh as much as it did be- 
fore combustion, plus the weight of the gas combin- 
ing with it in burning. A delicate pair of scales 
would testify to this in the most convincing fashion: 
it would show us that this heap of what looks like 
snow-flakes weighs more than the phosphorus that 
went to the making of it. How account for the 
added weight except by ascribing it to the air that 
played its part in the combustion? ‘So, then, in the 
substance on this plate, in the burnt phosphorus, 
there is a small amount of oxygen taken from the 
atmosphere and securely retained. This oxygen 
has ceased to be an invisible gas occupying a great 
space, and has become part of a solid substance 
that can be seen and handled, and that occupies a 
comparatively small space. It is stored up as in 
a reservoir, where chemical combination has col. 
lected and compressed it into the least possible bulk. 
‘‘A similar chemical action attends the burning of 
any substance whatever. By being consumed it be- 
comes a storehouse of oxygen. ‘Taken in its sum 
total, and with no omission of any part, the resulting 
matter after combustion is heavier than the sub- 
stance before combustion; and this excess of weight 
is due to the gas that took part in the combustion. 
Most of these burnt substances, veritable store- 
houses of oxygen, hold on to the latter with a ten- 
acity that can be overcome if necessary, but that 
nevertheless offers very great resistance, while the 
lesser number surrender this oxygen easily. After 
a brief survey of this latter class we will select the 
substance best suited to our purpose of obtaining
-P-A-G-E-143
  - BURNING PHOSPHORUS 135 
oxygen in its pure form. But we will first finish 
our examination of burnt phosphorus while we have 
a specimen before our eyes. 
‘‘Although derived chiefly from phosphorus, 
which is highly inflammable, the snow-like powder in 
the plate is absolutely incombustible, the hottest 
fire having no effect on it, for the reason that what 
is once burned cannot be burned again. This phos- 
phorus, being already combined with as much oxygen 
as its nature permits, cannot take on any more; that 
is, its combustibility is at an end. Experiment will 
prove this better than mere words.”’ 
On a pan of glowing coals from the kiteheny fire 
was sprinkled a little of the white powder, and the 
coals were then blown to a more intense heat; but 
the powder showed no signs of taking fire, its in- 
flammability having been quite exhausted. 
‘‘If you had not already,’’ Uncle Paul resumed, 
‘‘some knowledge of the difference between com- 
pound substances and the simple substances compos- 
ing them, this experiment would open your eyes, for 
the substance that at first burned so freely now re- 
fuses to burn at all. Let us proceed. You can con- 
vince yourselves that the white powder in the plate 
has no smell whatever, whereas the phosphorus had 
a very strong smell of garlic. But I would not have 
you touch this powder, its properties being such as 
to render handling harmful; still less do I wish you 
to taste it, as it would make you ery out with pain.’’ 
‘Is it so terrible as all that?’’ asked Emile. 
‘*So terrible that a drop of molten lead on your 
tongue would be less painful.’’ 
  
-P-A-G-E-144
1386 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
‘‘But that snowy stuff looks harmless enough.’’ 
‘‘Don’t trust to looks, my little friend. Innocent 
looks may disguise a very dangerous substance. 
Forewarned is forearmed. From the kitchen of 
the chemist there very rarely comes anything 
pleasant to the taste. However, it is well for you to 
have some idea of how phosphorus tastes, and to 
make it less disagreeable to the tongue I will dis- 
solve it in water.”’ 
So saying, Uncle Paul took up the Hsuitiae again 
and swept the contents of the plate into a glass of 
wate:. As each particle fell into the liquid it gave 
a hissing sound, like that produced when a black- 
smith plunges red-hot iron into water. 
‘*Tt must be awfully hot, must n’t it,’? asked Emile, 
‘‘to hiss like that in the water?”’ » 
‘‘Heat is not the cause of the hissing. The pow- 
der is no hotter than anything else here,—no hotter 
than the plate it lies on. I have already told you 
that burnt phosphorus has an extraordinary liking 
for water; and you know what extreme precautions 
I had to take, with the aid of quicklime, to keep it 
from the moisture in the atmosphere. Now I let 
this powder drink as much water as it pleases, and 
it dissolves immediately and even with violence, that 
sharp noise testifying to a satisfied thirst. 
‘‘Behold, now, the snowy powder all dissolved in 
the water. The liquid has not changed its appear- 
ance; it is still water as far as looks are concerned; 
but dip the tip of your finger in and taste it. You 
ean do so without the least fear.’’ 
As the children hestitated, remembering the allu- 
 
-P-A-G-E-145
      “ BURNING PHOSPHORUS 137 
sion to the drop of molten lead, their uncle dipped 
the tip of his little finger into the liquid and touched 
it to his tongue; whereupon, emboldened by his ex- 
ample, Emile and Jules did likewise. 
‘*Oh, how sour it is!’’ they cried, surprised at the 
disagreeable taste and making a wry face. ‘‘It is 
sourer than any vinegar they use for making salad. 
What would it have been like if Uncle had n’t 
weakened it with a lot of water?’’ 
‘‘Your tongues would have suffered terrible tor- 
tures, my little friends. The part touched would 
have been eaten away at once by this violent chem-. 
ical, and you would have heard a hissing as of red- 
hot iron in contact with your saliva.”’ 
‘‘Then this strong vinegar isn’t real vinegar?”’ 
‘*Tt is not vinegar at all, though it tastes much like 
it. Now let us go on. Phosphorus has still an- 
other property that we must test. Here are some 
violets just gathered from the garden. I dip one » 
into the sour-tasting liquid, and it immediately loses 
its blue color and turns red. All flowers of the same 
color as the violet—the iris and the bluebell, for 
example—would likewise turn red in the sour liquid. 
You shall at your leisure repeat this fine experiment 
with all the flowers you can find in the garden, and 
you will always see the blue flowers turn red. Burnt 
phosphorus, then, always has this sour taste and this 
quality of turning blue flowers red. 
‘*T will add that most of the other metalloids, such 
as sulphur, carbon, nitrogen, and many more, when 
they combine with oxygen,—or when they burn, as 
we say,—produce compounds of like sourness and ~
-P-A-G-E-146
  1388 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
of like ability to change the color of blue flowers to 
red. All these compounds are ealled acids, from 
their sour or acid taste, and they are distinguished 
one from another by the addition of a second term 
indicating their origin. Thus the snowy powder 
resulting from the burning of phosphorus bears the 
name of phosphoric acid, and in future that is what 
we will call burnt phosphorus.’’
-P-A-G-E-147
CHAPTER XI 
BURNING METALS 
LL the blue flowers in the garden had been 
tested with phosphoric acid. After the vio- 
let had come the iris, after the iris the periwinkle, 
then the veronica, and others besides; and all had 
lost their natural color and turned red. Yellow 
flowers, on the other hand, such as the marigold, 
and white ones like the Easter daisy, and red ones 
such as the poppy, did not change color at all when 
dipped into the acid liquid. For some time, now, 
the contents of the glass had been used in these ex: 
periments when Uncle Paul invited his pupils to 
take part in some new investigations; and the sum- 
mons was responded to with an outburst of joy. 
This time the equipment consisted of a small porta- 
ble stove full of charcoal and set to burn in the fire- 
place, while on the table were some bits of zine, 
doubtless the remnants of a worn-out watering-can. 
There was also an old iron spoon, in so sorry a con- 
dition that no beggar would have stopped to pick it 
up in the street. A bottle hardly longer than your 
finger contained something grayish, of metallic ap- 
pearance, shaped like a narrow ribbon and wound 
about in the form of a skein. The boys puzzled in 
vain to guess what this could be. Their uncle told 
139
-P-A-G-E-148
  140 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
them in due time, but before doing so he resumed 
his talk as follows: 
‘‘How to obtain pure oxygen freed from the nitro- 
gen with which it is mixed in the atmosphere was the 
difficult problem engaging our attention at our last 
lesson, and it will continue to do so to-day. We 
know that the sour-tasting compounds, the acids, 
made by burning various metalloids, notably phos- 
phorus, contain an abundance of oxygen taken 
from the air and stored up. That is the first stage 
of the journey toward our destination. Another 
lies ahead, and when we have accomplished it we 
can, with better understanding, avail ourselves of 
the means offered us by chemical science. Perhaps 
you will say I am straying from the road that leads 
straight to the element, oxygen, which you are so 
eager to learn about, and you will reproach me for 
dividing the journey into more stages than neces- 
sary.’’ 
‘‘Oh, never fear,’’ Jules hastened to reply; ‘‘you 
may make the journey as many stages long as you 
like. If they are all as interesting as the last one, 
when you showed us snowflakes made by fire, we 
sha’n’t be the ones to complain. Oxygen will have 
its turn all in good time.’’ 
‘<''o-day’s stage in our journey, my young friends, 
will be no less interesting than the one that preceded 
it. I think it will give you an even greater surprise; 
and in the end it will show us how to obtain pure 
oxygen, which is what we started out for. Let us 
talk a little more about the burning of various sub- 
stances.
-P-A-G-E-149

‘¢A piece of phosphorus on fire is certainly a fine 
sight. The vigor with which it burns, the dazzling 
brightness of its flame, the snowy flakes of phos- 
phoric acid resulting from. the combustion—all 
these cannot fail to arouse interest. But, accus- 
tomed as you already were by the use of matches 
to seeing phosphorus burn, this spectacle had in 
your eyes none of the fascination of the new and un- 
expected. To witness the burning of a substance 
well known to be highly inflammable is nothing very 
thrilling. But to-day you will be rather surprised 
to see things burn that you have always thought 
to be fireproof. We are going to set metals on 
fire,’’ 
‘‘Metals!’’ cried Emile with a start of astonish- 
ment. ; 
‘*] said that would rather surprise you. Yes, my 
boy, metals, real metals.’ 
‘‘But metals don’t burn.’’ 
‘“Who told you so?”’ 
‘Nobody told me, but I know what I see every 
day. Tongs, fire-shovel, andirons are made of iron, 
which is a metal; and, even in the hottest kind of a 
fire, I have never seen any of these things burn. 
The stove is metal, and in winter when it gets red- 
hot with a roaring fire inside I have never seen a 
particle of it burn. Why, the whole stove would 
have burnt up long ago if metals could take fire as 
you say they do!”’’ 
‘<Then Emile does not believe me when I say that 
metals can burn?’’ 
‘*What can I say, Uncle Paul? You put my faith
-P-A-G-E-150
142 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
in you to a hard test. You might as well tell me 
that water can burn, too.”’ 
‘‘And why not, as I am going to show you some 
day that it can?”’ 
‘*Water burn?”’ 
‘*Yes, my child; I propose to show you some day 
that water contains the very best kind of material 
for burning.’’ 
Astounded at this promise, made with undoubted 
sincerity, Emile said no more, but waited to see 
metals burn, before believing what seemed to him 
incredible. His uncle continued: 
‘‘If the tongs, shovel, andirons, stove, and other 
things made of iron do not burn in our fireplaces 
and kitchens, it is because the heat is not intense 
enough. Make more heat, and metal will not fail 
to take fire. You have often seen this burning of 
iron, but without suspecting what it really was. Let 
us recall what we see from time to time at the black- 
smith’s shop when we pass his door. The smith has 
just taken from the forge a bar of iron, glowing hot. 
As soon as it comes to the air this bar of dazzling 
brightness throws out showers of brilliant sparks in 
every direction, so that one might mistake it for a 
piece of fireworks. The dark shop is all ablaze with 
blinding flashes. What are these sparks that fly 
off in showers? Little scales of iron that become de- 
tached from the bar and burn as they shoot through 
the air. Does Emile begin to believe me now?’’ 
‘*Yes, I am beginning to. I see more and more 
every day that anything may be expected in chem- 
istry.”’ } |
-P-A-G-E-151
  BURNING METALS 143 
‘‘T will tell you further that when the makers of 
fireworks wish their pinwheels, Roman candles, 
rockets, and squibs to throw out splendid sparks 
like sprays of water from a fountain, they mix with 
gunpowder a quantity of filings of various metals 
according to the colors they wish to obtain. 
Copper gives green sparks, iron white. Each par- 
ticle of these metal filings turns into a spark as soon 
as it touches fire. I am planning to show you, one 
of these days, a conflagration of iron that will make 
the blacksmith’s shop look dull and tame. So I will 
say but little more at present about this metal, 
merely adding a third example to the two I have 
just cited. 
‘*You both know how to get bright sparks by strik- 
ing flint and steel together, or flint and the back of 
a knife-blade. Those sparks are particles of metal, 
of steel, which is a variety of iron, that are struck 
off, becoming heated by the shock and burning as 
they fly through the air. In exactly the same way 
sparks fly off from the stone of the scissors-grinder 
when. he sharpens a piece of cutlery on it, and from 
an iron horseshoe when it strikes a pebble. The 
violent friction of the grindstone and the shock of 
the horseshoe’s hitting the hard pebble break off fine 
_seales of iron, and these, raised to intense heat by 
- the friction, catch fire as they dart off through the 
air. You see, you don’t have to go very far to find 
plain proofs that iron really will burn, which at first 
seemed so impossible to you. The scissors-grinder 
sharpening a knife and the mule stumbling on a 
stone teach us what Emile found so hard to believe;
-P-A-G-E-152

they perform for the wide-awake observer one of 
chemistry’s fine experiments. 
‘‘T pass now to another metal, zinc, Here are 
some pieces, the remains of an old watering-can that 
has been thrown away. This metal is grayish on 
the surface, but if I scratch it a little with a file or 
the point of a knife, we get a glimpse of metallic 
luster like that of tin or silver. Now what we wish 
to do is to make this zine burn,—quite an easy 
operation and readily performed with the help of a 
few live coals. It is the same with metals as with 
the things we commonly think of as inflammable, 
such as sulphur and phosphorus and charcoal, for 
example: some catch fire easily, others with diffi- 
culty. At the mere touch of a lighted match phos- 
phorus is instantly ablaze, while sulphur is much 
slower and charcoal more obstinate still. In the 
same way, while iron requires the heat of a forge to 
make it burn, zinc needs only a few live coals. 
There are some metals that burn still more easily, 
as we shall soon see. 
‘*Let us proceed, now, to make zine burn. I place 
a few pieces of it in this old and discarded iron 
spoon, and thrust the spoon thus filled into the midst 
of the glowing coals in this little stove. If you have 
any doubts, our experiment will settle them for you.’’ 
Everything being arranged as Uncle Paul had in- 
dicated, they waited a little while. The zine melted 
almost as readily as lead, and when the spoon was 
red-hot the coals were pushed aside a little to show 
the melted zine without cooling it off. Then with a 
stout piece of iron wire Uncle Paul began to stir the
-P-A-G-E-153
BURNING METALS 145 
molten metal so as to bring it into better contact 
with the air. A flame burst forth, of a superb 
bluish white, dazzling to the eyes, though of no great 
volume. It flickered on the surface of the liquid 
metal, springing up brighter or dying down, accord- 
ing to the briskness with which the matter was 
stirred. The boys marveled at the brilliance of the 
burning zine, and their wonder was heightened as 
they saw a kind of snow rise from the flame, float 
lightly in the air, and spread all about the room. 
One might have taken it for the finest of incompar- 
ably white down, or those delicate shreds of cobweb 
that one sees fluttering over the fields on a fine 
autumn morning. At the same time, on the surface 
of the metal in the spoon, there collected a kind of 
cotton-wool of unparalleled fineness. The current 
of hot air from the stove moved it lightly, detaching 
the flakes they saw rising and spreading through the 
room. 
‘‘This white fluff,’’ resumed Uncle Paul, ‘‘this 
down or cotton, is burnt zinc, zinc combined with 
oxygen from the atmosphere, and it bears the same 
relation to this metal that the snowy flakes bear to 
phosphorus. We will ascertain its chief properties 
as soon as there is enough in the spoon.”’ 
Jules took his uncle’s place in stirring the molten 
metal, while Emile began to blow the flakes before 
him, taking care not to blow hard enough to drive 
them too fast, even the largest of them floating so 
lightly in the air, despite their size, that it seemed 
as if they would never settle down. Soon there was 
no more of the shiny liquid left in the spoon, all the 
 
-P-A-G-E-154
146 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
zine having turned into this white material. When 
the residue of this in the spoon had cooled off and 
been emptied out, Uncle Paul continued: 
‘‘Burnt zine is a white substance such as you now 
see before you. It is also quite tasteless. Put some | 
on your tongue and it will convey no sense of taste.”’ 
“That ’s so,’’ affirmed Emile, after trying it 
cautiously, warned by his previous experience with 
burnt phosphorus. ‘‘It has n’t any more taste than 
a pinch of sand or sawdust.’’ 
‘**T don’t taste anything, either,’’ Jules chimed in; 
‘fand yet the burnt phosphorus, the phosphorie acid, 
was so sour you could n’t bear it. Now, here ’s some- 
thing else that we ’ve burnt, and it hasn’t any 
Saste at all.’’ 
‘‘Let us seek the reason for this lack of taste,** 
suggested his uncle. ‘‘I drop a good pinch of the 
white substance into this glass of water and stir it 
well with a stick. It does not dissolve, does not 
melt in the water; it is, as we say, insoluble. You 
remember how readily, on the other hand, the burnt 
phosphorus or phosphoric acid dissolved in water.”’ 
‘“We are not likely,’’ replied Emile, ‘‘to forget 
very soon that terrible stuff that melts in water with 
a hissing sound like red-hot iron, and that has to 
have dried air if you want to keep it.’’ 
‘‘Let us put together these various facts: burnt 
phosphorus dissolves in water and has a taste; 
‘burnt zine does not dissolve in water and has no 
taste. In the same way, salt and sugar readily dis- 
solve in water, and both have a taste, the first a salt 
taste, the second a sweet taste. Marble and brick do 
« ~ 
 
-P-A-G-E-155
  BURNING METALS 147 
not dissolve in water, nor has either of them the 
slightest taste. Do you begin to see what these 
facts point to?”’ 
‘‘Tt seems to me from all that,’’ replied Jules, 
‘<that to have any taste a thing must be able to melt 
in water.’’ 
‘‘T have no fault to find with that answer. Yes, 
my boy, what a substance must have in order to 
possess any taste at all, whether strong or weak, 
sweet or sour, salt or bitter, or whatever flavor, is 
solubility in water. Anything that cannot be dis- 
solved in--water is by that very fact tasteless, and 
for this reason: to act on the sense of taste, to make 
an impression on tongue or palate, a substance 
must necessarily, unless it be a liquid, dissolve in the 
saliva, being thus divided into extremely small par- 
ticles and brought into contact with the organs de- 
signed to perceive it. Now, saliva is almost entirely 
composed of water. If, then, a substance is insol- 
uble in water, it is also insoluble in saliva, and there- 
fore has no taste. In future, when you see a sub- 
stance that will not dissolve in water, don’t try to 
see how it tastes, for it has no taste and cannot have 
any. But if it yields to the action of water, it has 
a taste,—sometimes very insipid, it is true, and 
hardly perceptible, as gum Arabic, for example. 
‘To return to our two burnt substances: the white 
material left by the burning zinc has no taste, be- 
cause it is not soluble in water, whereas the white 
material left by the burning phosphorus is easily 
soluble and consequently has a very decided taste.’’ 
‘¢Ves, very decided,’’ assented Emile, ‘‘for it eats
-P-A-G-E-156
  148. THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
away the part of the tongue it touches. But tell 
me, Uncle, if burnt zine could melt in water, so as 
to have a taste, what sort of a taste would it be? 
Would it be as strong as the taste of burnt phos- 
phorus?’’ 
‘‘As to that, my little friend, neither I nor any one 
else can give you a sure answer, no one having ex- 
perimented with such an impossibility. All we can 
say is that probably the taste would be detestable, 
as is the taste of ninety-nine chemicals out of a hun- 
dred. 
‘“When we exhibit fireworks we keep for the last 
the most beautiful piece of all, the star number on 
our program. This I am doing to-day, reserving to 
the end the prize piece in our collection, the most 
splendid example of metal-burning. The material 
for this display is there in that little bottle.’’ 
“That thing that looks like a skein of narrow 
gray ribbon?’’ asked Emile. 
Yo, that ’s:1t.”” 
‘‘Tt does n’t look as if it could do anything.”’ 
‘‘It can do much more than its appearance prom- 
ises. Let us examine it closely.’’ 
So saying, Uncle Paul took the skein out of the 
bottle. It was a dull gray ribon, narrow, very thin, 
and as flexible as tinfoil. When scratched with a 
knife it showed the brightness peculiar to metals. 
By this brightness and the whitish color the children 
thought they recognized the metal. 
‘‘Tt is either lead or tin,’’ declared Emile. 
‘*T should rather say zine or iron,’’ said Jules. 
‘‘It is not any of those metals,’’ their uncle told
-P-A-G-E-157
  BURNING METALS 149 
them. ‘‘This is a metal you have never seen before, 
nor have you ever even heard of it.’’ 
‘‘And what is it called, please?’’ was Emile’s 
eager inquiry. 
‘*TIt is called magnesium.’’ 
‘‘Ma-ma—’’ stammered the boy. ‘‘Please say it 
again.’ 
‘“Magnesium.’’ 
‘Oh, what a funny name!’’ 
‘No funnier than bismuth, barium, or titanium.’’ 
‘‘Are those the names of metals?”’ 
‘“Yes, my child, they are the names of metals. If 
they sound strange to you, it is because you now 
hear them for the first time. One gets used to bis- 
muth and titanium just as much as to copper and 
lead. As I have already told you, there are about 
- fifty metals. Most of them remain unknown to us, 
not being in common use; their names, being seldom 
heard in ordinary conversation, strike the ear rather 
strangely at first. After you have become ac- 
quainted with magnesium, you will find its name 
easy to remember and it will cease to have the un- 
wonted sound it has at present. 
‘¢ A few live coals are enough to make zine burn; 
a candle-flame will set fire to magnesium, and the 
metal will go on burning of its own accord when onee 
it is started. It lights almost as easily as a paper 
spill.’? 
‘¢ And where do they find this queer metal?’’ Emile 
inquired. ‘‘I should be willing to spend some of the 
pennies I have saved up if I could buy a piece.”’ 
‘‘Magnesium is not a metal in common use. It is ‘ ae J — 
"2a.
-P-A-G-E-158
  150 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
unknown to the blacksmith, the tinsmith, and the 
coppersmith. It is a substance used chiefly in scien- 
tific research and in chemical experiments of an en- 
tertaining sort. It can be procured at city drug 
shops and toy-shops, where it is sold as one of those 
curlosities that instruct and amuse at the same time; 
and it is from the city that I brought it home for 
your benefit.’ 
A candle having been lighted, the shutters were 
closed so as not to let the daylight lessen the brilliant 
effect of the burning metal. Then Uncle Paul cut 
off a short strip of the magnesium ribbon, and, taking 
hold of one end with a pair of pincers, touched the 
other to the candle-flame. A sheet of paper was 
spread on the table to receive what might fall from 
the burning metal. Catching fire very quickly, the 
ribbon was withdrawn from the candle and held in 
an upright position over the sheet of paper, after 
which it needed no further assistance; the magne- 
sium burned alone. It was as if a sudden burst of 
dazzling sunlight had illuminated the darkened 
room. A superb white light, intense enough to pene-. 
trate every corner and render all objects clearly vis- 
ible, came in waves from the splendid torch. No 
sputtering, no noise whatever, no flying sparks. It 
was the calm, sustained illumination of daylight. 
Dumb with astonishment at this brilliant display, 
the boys gazed in fascination. The burning con- 
tinued, the flame approaching ever nearer to the pin-

‘¢Oh, how beautiful, how splendid that was!’’ cried 
the children, rubbing their eyes, dazzled by the glare. 
Their uncle opened the shutters to let in the day- 
light. 
‘“Why, I can’t see;’’ said Emile, still rubbing his 
eyes. ‘‘I ’m nearly blind from looking at the mag- 
nesium flame. 
‘‘And, I,’’ added Jules, ‘‘am almost as dazzled 
as if I bad been staring at the sun.”’ 
‘“That will pass off in a few minutes,’’ their uncle 
assured them. ‘‘Wait until your eyes recover from 
the fatigue caused by the too-bright light of the mag- 
nesium flame.”’ 
The dazzling effect having worn off, as it did in 
a short time, Emile spoke of something that had 
struck him while the magnesium was burning. 
‘‘T was looking,’’ said he, ‘‘at the flame of the 
candle, which you had left burning after setting fire 
to the magnesium, and all I saw was something of 
a reddish color, smoky and dull. How pale the 
candle looked, and it had been bright enough before! | 
I could hardly make out any flame at all. Is it pos- 
sible, I asked myself, that that can give light?’’ 
‘Tf you set a lighted candle in the full glare of the 
sunshine, can you see the flame?’’ asked Uncle Paul. 
‘‘No; it looks as pale and dim as it did in the 
magnesium light.’’ 
‘““That, my little friend, comes from the inability 
of the eye, when exposed to a bright light, to see, 
except imperfectly, a dim one. In full sunlight one 
cannot tell whether live coals are really alive or not. 
The flame that gave light in the dark ceases to do so

when overpowered by a greater brilliance. Our 
dazzled eyes and the apparently dulled flame of the 
candle prove to us that the magnesium light is one 
of the brightest possible; it bears comparison only 
with the sun. 
‘*T hope I have now convinced you, including even 
the skeptical Emile, that metals are not hard to 
burn. The flying sparks of burning iron in the 
blacksmith’s shop, the firing of zine in our old spoon, 
and finally the dazzling magnesium flame, have 
furnished proof upon proof. Furthermore, the last 
experiment shows us that among the metals there 
are some that would give us splendid light if it were 
not for their price and scarcity. Instead of lamp 
oil or candle grease we could use a magnesium 
ribbon for lighting. Who knows what the future 
may have in store for us in this field? The history 
of chemistry is full of wonderful discoveries, and 
we already owe so many and important improve- 
ments to this science that we may well look to it 
for still greater things. | 
‘‘But without dwelling longer on the brilliant 
splendors of magnesium let us see what has become 
of the metal after burning. The substance that has 
fallen on to the paper over which the ribbon burned 
is a white material which, when touched, crumbles 
into a soft powder like flour or, better, like ground 
chalk of a very fine quality. It does not dissolve in 
water, and consequently has no taste. In addition 
to the metal itself, it contains, as does everything 
else after burning, oxygen taken from the air in the 
process of burning.” So here is another storehouse

of oxygen from which this gas could be obtained by 
using the proper means, but not without some 
difficulty. 
‘‘Tron burns.. Hammered on the anvil when red- 
hot, it gives out sparks which are tiny scales of this 
metal on fire. Let us get some of these particles of 
burnt iron from the smith, and we shall find them 
to be of a black material, rather hard, but still yield- 
ing to the pressure of our fingers. This black 
material, this burnt iron, Ws called oxid_ of 1 
/oZine burns, being dangad GF ths prowma Hb 
a white substance of which part is wafted upward 
from the flame and floats in the air like shreds of 
cotton or down. This white substance, this burnt 
zine, is called oxid of zine. 
‘Magnesium burns, and becomes thereby a white 
substance looking much like very fine chalk and ex- 
tremely soft to the touch. This chalk-like sub- 
stance, this burnt magnesium, is called oxid of 
magnesium. 
‘As a rule, metals are combustible, though there 
are exceptions; and in burning they combine with 
oxygen from the air or elsewhere, being thus 
changed into compounds which have none of the 
luster of metals and which take the name of oxid. 
An oxid is a burnt metal, just as an acid is a burnt 
metalloid, and both contain oxygen.’’

HE white substance left by the burning mag- 
nesium had been wrapped in paper, and 
Uncle Paul took it up again as his opening topic 
in the next lesson. 
‘‘ Judging from looks only,’’ said he, ‘‘we com- 
pared this powder to flour and also to very finely 
ground chalk. If we considered its properties, we 
ought rather to compare it to lime. This latter, at 
first a rough and shapeless stone, swells on being 
soaked in water, and then cracks to pieces and turns 
into a white powder closely resembling burnt 
magnesium. Nor is this resemblance misleading, 
for chalk is also a burnt metal.’’ | 
‘‘A burnt metal!’’ repeated Emile, in surprise. 
‘‘T never knew chalk was made by burning a metal.’’ 
‘‘Naturally not,’’ replied his uncle, ‘‘for that is 
not the way it is obtained. If, in order to get lime, | 
we had to burn the metal that enters into its forma- 
tion, the mason would never venture to use a trowel- 
ful of mortar, because of its excessive price.”’ 
‘‘T know how lime is made,’’ put in Jules. ‘‘Out 
in the country they pile up stones and charcoal in 
a lime-kiln, and the fire bakes the stones and turns 
them to lime all ready for use.’’ 
154 
 
-P-A-G-E-163
SALTS 155 
‘“‘That is it. The stone they use is called lime- 
stone, and it contains lime and something else; this 
latter the fire drives out, so that, after the burning 
is finished, the lime is left by itself, ready for the 
mason and very different from the original stone. 
It is really a burnt metal, though the lime-burner 
knows nothing about the burning of metals, and does 
not even suspect the presence of a metal in the prod- 
uct of his kiln. The honest lime-burner would be 
greatly surprised to be told that his lime contains 
a metal; he would laugh in your face and say you 
were joking. But nothing could be further from 
joking; lime comes from the burning of a metal or, 
in other words, from the combining of a metal with 
oxygen. Its particles may be likened to the tiny 
scales that fall from red-hot iron as it comes from 
the forge, and to the flakes that fly off from zine 
burning in the bed of glowing charcoal, and also to 
that floury powder left on the sheet of paper by the 
briliant magnesium flame. In a word, lime is an 
oxid. ‘‘It is true that in producing this oxid the 
hand of man played no part, the combustion having 
taken place of itself, perhaps at the very beginning 
of things; and, since the creation of the world, the 
metallic part of lime has never been found alone 
anywhere in nature. It abounds nearly every- 
where, but so greatly changed, so completely dis- 
ouised in the combinations of which it forms a part, 
that it has required much shrewdness on the part of 
science to guess its existence, and still greater skill 
to restore some particles of it to their primitive

state, that of a real metal. Here isa pinch of burnt . 
magnesium, and here one of powdered lime; look 
at them well and tell me, if you can, in what the two 
differ.’’ 
‘‘We can’t see any difference,’’ the boys agreed, 
after a careful examination. ‘‘Both are white, and 
both look like flour.’’ 
‘‘T see no difference, either,’’ their uncle rejoined. 
‘We are all three of one mind as to this close re- 
semblance, though we know the two to be different 
substances. Let us, then, say, with those who are 
wiser than we, that this powder, lime, is the oxid 
of a metal, just as this other powder is the oxid of 
another metal, magnesiym.’’ 
‘‘What is this limé metal called?’’ asked Jules. 
‘It is called calcium.”’ 
‘‘Why, that isn’t 80 very different from what the 
farmers round here eall lime; they call it cals.’’ 
‘*T will tell you, my boy, that the common speech 
of our part of the country, like that of other 
southern provinces, contains the relics of a tongue 
spoken long ago, venerable relics that, instead of 
being ridiculed as they are by the foolish, should be 
preserved with veneration. Our popular terms re- 
produce, though corrupted by centuries of use, the 
superb Latin tongue that came from Rome with 
civilization. In that language lime was called calz, 
and this word has been preserved almost unchanged 
in the common term you just named. So, you see, 
the rustic term needs no apology, its parentage be- 
ing one of the noblest. He who speaks the native 
tongue of the South speaks something very like 
 
-P-A-G-E-165
SALTS 157 
Latin. Men of learning, who delight, not without 
reason, in going back to ancient usages, have made 
calax into calcwm, a sonorous and pleasing term, to 
designate the metal that enters into the formation 
of lime; but they might just as well have started 
with our popular word, cals. 
‘‘Well, then, the metal element in lime is calcium, 
the name coming from the Latin word calx, which 
means lime.’’ 
‘Will you show us some of this metal?’’ asked 
Jules, eagerly. 
‘‘Alas, no, my lad! Our humble laboratory can- 
not afford so costly a curiosity. Not that calcium . 
is rare, for it is to be found almost everywhere, the 
very rocks in many regions abounding in it, and 
whole mountain chains being largely made of it; 
but the difficulty is to extract it from the compounds 
that contain it, to bring it back to its original state 
of a simple metal. If we were to ransack all the 
chemical laboratories in France, we should perhaps 
find not more than a handful or two, so difficult and 
expensive is its preparation. That is why your 
Uncle Paul’s collection of chemicals is now and al- 
ways will be destitute of such treasures. But, at 
any rate, I can tell you about it. Imagine some- 
thing white and shiny, almost like silver in ap- 
pearance, and as soft as wax, so that it can be 
kneaded and molded with the fingers. That is cal 
cium.’’ 
Here Emile interrupted his uncle. ‘‘What!’’ he 
cried, ‘‘calecium a metal that can be kneaded with the

to yield to the pressure of the fingers and be molded

‘‘T wish I had some to make into little men that 
would look like silver statues.’’ 
‘‘It would be a very expensive amusement, and I 
have told you why. Also, it would be hard on your 
hands, for this terrible stuff catches fire more easily 
than anything you have ever seen. If, while you 
were molding it, your little statue were all at once 
to burst into flames, what would become of the 
sculptor ?”’ ! 
‘“That would n’t be so much fun, would it?’’ 
‘Beware, then, of burns! Calcium catches fire 
by merely touching water. Burning coal, sulphur, 
and phosphorus are extinguished by water; calcium, 
on the contrary, is set on fire by it. Let it get a 
little damp and, behold, it begins to burn. Do not 
look incredulous when I tell you this, for it is noth- 
ing but the exact truth. In a lesson soon to follow 
I will show you that water is not, as you think it to 
be, always effectual in putting out a fire; and who 
knows—perhaps—well, we will see whether my 
purse will allow it.’’ 
‘‘What is your purse going to allow?’’ 
‘‘'he purchase, it may be, of a metal that, like 
calcium, has the peculiarity of catching fire in 
water.’’ 
‘‘There are others, then?’’ 
‘Yes, three or four.’’ 
‘¢And will you really show us one of them?”’ 
‘‘T make no promise. I will see, I will do my

best, if you continue to take as much pleasure in 
these studies as you have taken so far.”’ 
‘¢We should be hard to please if we didn’t like 
to see magnesium burn, phosphorus and zine turn 
to snow, and other metals catch fire in water.’’ 
‘‘To return to Emile’s wish, calcium’s readiness 
to take fire on touching water being now known to 
you, you see how dangerous it would be to mold it 
in your fingers, damp as these always are with their 
natural moisture. If we had any calcium, it is not 
a thing to hold in the hands and knead with the 
fingers; it is a dangerous substance to be left quietly 
reposing in its bottle. 
‘‘But now let us pass on from calcium to its oxid, 
lime. We find that this has a taste of its own, which 
the oxid of iron, zinc, and magnesium have not; and 
this taste is strong, disagreeable, and of a burning 
nature. The taste of phosphorus, after combustion, 
is sour, acid, whereas that of burnt calcium is 
caustic, or fiery. Furthermore, it is not the sense 
of taste alone that lime affects unpleasantly; it ex- 
erts its corrosive energy on every part of the body. 
Handled carelessly for any length of time, it would 
gnaw the hands. Like the metal it comes from, it 
is a harsh substance, and prolonged contact with it 
is to be avoided. 
‘‘Not lacking in flavor, lime ought to be soluble 
in water; and in fact it is, though not to any great 
extent, but merely enough to give the water an un- 
bearable taste. If we dilute in water a little lime 
previously reduced to a paste, the liquid will turn 
white like milk; then, after it has stood a while, the
-P-A-G-E-168
160 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
undissolved lime will settle to the bottom and the 
water will resume its former clearness; but in this 
clear water, this water showing no trace of any 
foreign substance, there is dissolved lime, just as 
there is dissolved sugar in sweetened water. This 
we know from the burning, lime-like taste of the 
liquid.”’ 
Illustrating by experiment while he talked, Uncle 
Paul made his hearers taste of the water in: which 
he had dissolved a little lime. A drop of the liquid 
on the tip of the finger and touched to the tongue 
was enough to convince them of its disagreeable 
taste. Emile made a grimace of disgust, spitting 
several times and rather overdoing his show of re- 
pugnance, for the flavor is not so offensive as his 
actions indicated. Uncle Paul then continued: 
‘“*Here are some violets that I picked just now 
in the garden. I showed you how these flowers and 
others of the same color lose their blue and turn 
red when acted upon by a burnt metalloid, an acid, 
notably phosphoric acid, which you have experi- 
mented with to the nearly complete devastation 
of the garden, so far as its blue flowers are con- 
cerned. Now, what will happen to violets when 
acted upon by a burnt metal, an oxid? That is 
what this lime here is going to show us.”’ 
Uncle Paul selected a violet and pressed it lightly 
between his fingers with a little moistened lime, 
whereupon the flower instantly turned a brilliant 
green. 
‘‘Chemistry seems to be a dye factory,’’ observed 
Emile, astonished at this new transformation.
-P-A-G-E-169
  SALTS 161 
‘You took a little acid and made the blue of the 
violet turn red, and now you take lime and make the 
same blue turn green. When I know enough about 
chemistry I ’m going to make no end of colors for 
painting my pictures.’’ 
‘You will be able to make as many as you please, 
for chemistry teaches, among other things, how 
from a colorless substance a bright color may be 
obtained by certain combinations of elements; and 
it also teaches how a colored substance may be made 
to lose its color or change it into such and such 
another color. Yes, the making of dyes is an im- 
portant part of chemistry’s work, and as the op- 
portunity now occurs to give you some acquaintance 
with this interesting subject, I am glad to make the 
most of it. By using an acid we change the blue of 
the violet to red, and by using lime we change it to 
green. These two transformations, so complete 
and so instantaneous, give you an idea of how 
chemistry, with all the various drugs at its disposal, 
can produce the many different colors used by the 
painter and the dyer. 
‘‘T again take up my violet, turned green by the 
action of the lime, and dip it into this glass of water 
containing a few drops of some acid or other, no 
matter what, though in this instance it happens to 
be the acid that results from burning sulphur and. 
is called sulphuric acid. We shall get better ac- 
quainted with it later. I could make phosphoric 
acid serve equally well if you had not used up our 
supply in your experiments with flowers. Now 
keep your eyes open for what happens. In the

liquid acid the violet turns red, just as it would have 
done had it not been first subjected to the action of 
lime. When it is changed to red, I take it out of the 
glass and place it a second time in contact with 
lime, whereupon it turns green again. If it were 
dipped into the acid once more, it would turn red, 
and then if touched with moist lime a third time it 
would again change to green. Thus the flower 
would continue to turn alternately green and red 
from being alternately subjected to the action of 
lime and of acid.’’ 
‘‘Could these changes from green to red and from 
red to green go on a good many times?’’ asked 
Emile. 
‘*As many times as you pleased. On coming out 
of the acid the violet would be red, and after touch- 
ing moist lime it would be green. Oxids of iron, 
zinc, and magnesium do not have this property of 
turning violets and other blue flowers green, where- 
as the oxid of calcium, or lime, does. Whence 
comes this difference in the properties of these 
various metals? It comes from the same cause that 
determines the presence or the absence of taste. 
Lime, which dissolves in water, acts on the organs 
of taste, and it also acts on blue flowers by turning 
them green. The other three oxids, those of iron, 
zinc, and magnesium, do not dissolve in water, are 
tasteless, and do not turn blue flowers green, but 
leave them unchanged. 
‘But if these oxids were soluble in water, it is 
probable that they would have a burning taste, more 
or less like that of lime, and would turn violets and 
Re |

SALTS 163 
other blue flowers green. Indeed, we know that, 
besides lime, some other oxids are soluble in water, 
and all these oxids without exception have the burn- 
ing taste of lime, but much more pronounced; also, 
they all turn blue flowers green. Taking for the 
present no account of any but the soluble com- 
pounds, we may sum up in a few words what we 
have learned about acids and oxids. 
‘*An acid, which is a metalloid combined with 
oxygen, has a sour taste, and turns blue flowers red. | 
An oxid, which is a metal combined with oxygen, “ ~ 
has a burning taste, and turns blue flowers green. 
‘‘T must now tell you that an acid and an oxid 
can combine and thus produce a compound sub- 
stance, whose properties are, of course, different 
from those of either the acid or the oxid. You have 
not forgotten, I trust, that after chemical combina- 
tion has taken place one must not expect to find in 
the resulting compound the same properties that 
were in the separate substances before they united. 
You have a fairly good notion of phosphoric acid, 
having seen it made by burning phosphorus and 
having ascertained its unbearable sourness by tast- 
ing it. Lime, a very common substance, is still 
better known to you, and its burning taste is even 
at this moment on the tip of your tongue. Now, 
you would never guess what happens when we 
combine these two, this acid and this oxid, both of 
them harmful substances that must needs inspire 
us with grave mistrust. They are changed into

sary in the animal body: they become the rigid ma- 
terial that gives strength to our bones. 
‘‘Throw the bone from a leg of mutton or from 
a mutton chop into the fire, and you will see it 
burn; but what takes fire in this fashion is the 
grease and other animal matter that impregnate 
the bone. When this flame has subsided, the bone 
will be found in its original shape, pure white, and 
so fragile as to crush under the pressure of your 
fingers. There we have the essential elements that 
go to make bone, and they are alone by themselves, 
purged by fire so as to contain no alien matter. 
Being incombustible, they have undergone no 
change by heat, whereas all else has been consumed. 
‘‘Now, chemistry tells us that this white, stony 
material to which the burnt bone has been reduced 
is formed—not entirely, but nearly so—of phos- 
phoric acid and lime in combination. Grind this 
hard, white substance to a powder and taste it, 
and you will find it has no taste, whether sour or 
caustic. It is as if the substance contained neither 
phosphoric acid nor lime. It has no effect on either 
violets or any other blue flowers, their natural color 
remaining unchanged and without the slightest trace 
of red or reen. In short, the properties of both 
acid and oxid. have disappeared; what was active 
has become inert, and what was salt and what was 
caustic no longer have any taste. This stony ma- 
terial of bones, a combination of phosphoric acid 
and lime, is called phosphate of lime. It contains 
three elements, phosphorus, calcium, and oxygen, 
and therefore is, as we say, a ternary compound.

‘‘There are innumerable similar compounds,— 
j compounds, that is, made by combining an_acid. 
with an oxid. Chemistry calls them salts. Thus, / 
\ the white, stone-like substance left after a bone is 
burned, and known as phosphate of lime, is a salt.”’ 
‘‘You call that salt, that bone powder that has 
no salt taste at all?’’ exclaimed the boys, surprised 
to hear thus used a word they thought they knew 
the meaning of. 
‘‘Notice, my young friends,’’ their uncle corrected 
them, ‘‘I do not say the hard substance of the bone 
is salt; I say it is a salt. In common language the 
word ‘salt’ is used as the name of what we add to 
our food to heighten its flavor, as when we salt 
our soup or fish; but chemistry gives to this term a 
much wider meaning, applying it to every com- 
pound resulting from the union of an acid with an 
_ oxid. Every acid—and the number of acids is large 
—can combine with one or another of the oxids, 
which are still more numerous, and thus are formed 
salts in great number. Kitchen or common galt has 
given us a general name which we apply to a great 
many other compounds; but it is an unfortunate 
misnomer in its common use, for our qrdinary—salt 
really does not belong in the class of Salts as I have 
just defined them, not being composed of an~—acid-

all know so well, let us forget its so-called salt taste 
and its household use, and henceforth let us under-

sausage and ham must be something very different.”’ 
‘‘Yes, very different indeed, for what chemists 
call a salt is to be found in almost any stone on the

‘Yes, some are very abundant, forming the

‘Tt has a language of its own, and therefore it 
has rules for correct speaking when referring to 
the things it has to do with. But Emile has no 
need to be frightened at this word ‘grammar’; it 
has nothing to do with his hated conjugations. A 
few simple rules will make us master of it. Let us 
begin with the names of the acids. We know that 
an acid.is a burnt metalloid, or, in more precise 
“terms, a metalloid combined with oxygen. That of 
phosphorus is called phosphoric acid, and this ex- 
ample gives us our rule: to the name of the metal- 
loid, or to the chief part of that name, is added the 
ending ic, and we have the name of the acid. Surely, 
there ’s nothing hard about that. Phosphorus and 
ic, With the omission of us to make a pleasanter 
sound, unite and give us phosphoric, and that ’s all 
there is to it; we have the name of the acid of 
phosphorus. 
‘‘Let us take another metalloid. You are ae

quainted with nitrogen. I told you of its unwil- 
lingness to combine with oxygen. Nevertheless, by 
using skill and ingenuity enough, we may over- 
come this unwillingness and make the two elements 
unite. What will the acid thus formed be called?”’ 
‘According to the rule, I should say nitric acid,’’ 
answered Emile. ‘‘Is that right?’’ 
‘Perfectly. Another metalloid is called chlorin, 
which you know nothing about as yet; but no matter, 
you can give the name of its acid.”’ 
‘*Tt must be chloric acid, or I am much mistaken.’’ 
‘‘You are not in the least mistaken. Chloric acid 
is the correct name.”’ 
‘That ’s easy enough. Oh, I wish our grammar 
at school—”’ | 
‘‘Never mind your grammar at school just now, 
but let us proceed with our grammar of chemistry. 
From carbon we get an acid that you can name 
by following the rule already given.’’ 
‘‘Carbon and the ending ic make carbonic,’’ vol- 
unteered Jules. ‘‘It must be carbonic acid.’’ 
‘‘In the same way you will be able to name the 
acid derived from sulphur.”’ 
‘‘Oh, I have it!’’ cried Emile. ‘‘It is sulphuric 
acid.’’ 
‘““Yes, that is right. But enough, now, on the 
naming of acids. Let us pass on to that of oxids, 
which is simpler still. We say oxid of iron, oxid of 
zinc, oxid of copper, and so on, according to the 
metal in the compound we wish to name. I need 
only tell you to notice that certain oxids have re- 
tained their common name; familiar to people in

general from time immemorial, they have kept in 
chemistry the name acquired by long use. Thus, 
oxid of calcium is simply lime, both to the chemist 
and to the mason. The learned term gives way to 
the popular one. As we go on we shall meet with 
other oxids of the same exceptional sort in respect 
to name. 
‘‘There still remain to be considered in this con- 
nection the salts. They are formed, as we have 
already seen, by combining an acid and an oxid; and 
the rule to be followed in naming them is simple 
enough. In the name of the acid replace the ending 
ic by ate, follow it with the name of the metal 
supplying the oxid, and you will have the term de 
noting the salt. Thus nitric acid and oxid of zine 
form a salt called nitrate of zinc; carbonic acid 
and oxid of lead form another called carbonate of 
lead.’’ 
‘**T see,’’ said Emil; ‘‘and so, phosphoric acid and 
oxid of zine would make the salt called phosphorate 
of zine.’’ | 
‘‘According to the rule that is quite right, but 
not right according to usage. The ear is hard to 
please, even that of a chemist, who, without boggling 
over the trifles of language, nevertheless finds 
phosphorate a little disagreeable; and so for the 
sake of euphony the word is shortened to phosphate, 
as phosphate of zinc, phosphate of copper, ete. In 
the same way sulphurate is shortened to sulphate, as 
sulphate of iron, sulphate of lead, and so on. 
‘‘One word more and we shall have done with the 
subject. When a salt contains an oxid that has 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
  170 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
kept its common name instead of the name of the 
metal, this common name is still retained. Take 
as an illustration the salts whose oxid is furnished 
by calcium. We do not say sulphate of calcium, 
carbonate of calcium, but sulphate of lime, which is 
plaster of Paris, and carbonate of lime, which is 
limestone. Herewith ends our grammar.”’ 
‘‘The whole of it?’’ 
‘Not the whole, but the most important part.’’ 
‘Oh, I wish our school grammar—’’ 
‘Tush! Don’t worry about that.’’
-P-A-G-E-179
CHAPTER XITl 
A TALK ON’ TOOLS 
N the following day Uncle Paul resumed his 
talk. 
“This gas called oxygen,’’ said he, ‘‘the object 
of our search at present in our exploration of the 
field of chemistry—have I lost sight of it by allow- 
ing so many stages to our journey and thus giving 
you time to look about and get your bearings? 
Have we been straying from the direct road? Not 
by a hair’s breadth; we are nearing our goal; in 
fact, we have reached it. We have just learned 
that a salt is a storehouse of oxygen, that it is 
indeed doubly so, for its acid constituent is composed 
of this gas and a metalloid, while its oxid con- 
tains this same gas plus a metal. A salt, then, 
which unites in itself two burnt substances, is what 
we must go to if we wish to obtain the gas that 
makes things burn. Nevertheless we must use care 
in making our selection, for most salts stoutly resist 
decomposition and it is only with great difficulty 
that they can be made to give up their oxygen. 
We should have no better luck with them than with 
phosphoric acid or oxid of zinc. What they have 
once got they hold on to with a tight grip. Cotise- 
quently, we should be at a loss what to do if chemis- 
171 
 
-P-A-G-E-180
  172 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
try did not tell us the salt to resort to. It advises 
us to try chlorate of potash as being rich in oxygen 
and easy to decompose.’’ 
A bottle containing a white substance in the 
form of little transparent scales was set before the 
boys. | 
‘‘Here we have some chlorate of potash,’’ their 
uncle announced. ‘‘It came from the drug shop 
where I bought our stick of phosphorus and some 
other materials needed in our lessons.’’ 
‘<That looks a little like salt,’? Emile observed. 
‘*Yes, it looks like it, but its properties are very 
different. In particular, it has no salt taste; and 
also it contains oxygen in abundance, while kitchen 
salt has none at all. I must remind you once more 
that by an unfortunate accident of language the 
general term for all salts is taken from:a substance 
that is not, itself, a salt according to the accepted 
definition; that is, it is not a compound of an acid 
and an oxid. I will also ask you to bear in mind 
that many salts have the colorless and glassy ap- 
pearance of our common salt, and that this likeness, 
which is purely external, is responsible for the 
adoption of the term as used in chemistry.’’ 
‘‘Then you say this white stuff, this chlorate of 
potash, has oxygen in it, the gas that makes things 
burn?’’ 
‘*Yes, it has oxygen, and a great deal of it, too; 
so much, in fact, that a little handful of this salt will 
give us several liters of pure oxygen. It is there, 
squeezed into a small space by being combined with 
other things. Go back to our grammar of chemis-
-P-A-G-E-181
A TALK ON TOOLS 173 
try, of which you have learned the most important 
rules, and it will tell you what chlorate of potash is 
made of.’’ 
‘‘The word chlorate,’’ replied Jules, ‘‘tells me 
that the substance contains chloric acid. What 
that acid is like I don’t know, for I have never seen 
any; but I know at least that according to its name 
it has in it a metalloid, chlorin, and, besides that, 
some oxygen.’’ 
‘‘Right here let me add,’’ interposed his uncle, 
‘‘that this metalloid called chlorin is also present 
in kitchen salt. That will help you to remember the 
name, which is so new to you, and the time will come 
before long when you will become better acquainted 
with the thing itself. What else does the name 
chlorate of potash tell you?’’ 
‘‘Tt tells me that the salt contains an oxid fur- 
nished by a metal called potash, if I am not mis- 
taken.”’ 
‘*You are mistaken as to the name of the metal, 
but that is not your fault, for here we meet with an 
exception like that we found in the use of the word 
‘lime.’ You have not forgotten that certain well- 
known oxids retain in chemistry their popular 
names. We say ‘lime,’ and not ‘oxid of calcium’; 
and in similar manner we say ‘potash’ instead of 
‘oxid of potassium.’ As to this metal potassium, 
it is really a metal, much like the metal element in 
lime, but even softer and quicker to catch fire in 
water. Itis found in wood-ashes. But we need not 
discuss it further to-day; only notice, while we are 
on the subject, what curious facts are to be learned 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
174 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
from the commonest things when they are examined 
chemically. Thus, the salt we use in our cabbage 
soup gives us chlorin, a very interesting metalloid 
that Emile would not soon forget if he should 
venture to be too familiar with it; and the ashes 
from our hearth furnish potassium, a metal that 
catches fire at the mere touch of water. Briefly 
stated, potash is the oxid of the metal called potas- 
sium, and it is customary to say ‘chlorate of potash,’ 
‘sulphate of potash,’ and so on, just as we say 
‘sulphate of lime’ instead of ‘sulphate of calcium.’ 
So, you see, the salt we have here gets its oxygen 
both from the acid it contains in the form of chloric 
acid and from that present in its oxid, potash. 
‘‘his salt decomposes readily, needing only heat 
to make it surrender all its oxygen. Look here a 
moment, and you will be convinced.’’ 
So saying, Uncle Paul dropped a pinch of chlorate 
of potash upon a handful of glowing coals, where- 
upon the chlorate of potash melted with much bub- 
bling and foaming, while the coals all about it began 
to burn with extreme brightness and heat. It was 
as if a puff of wind had fanned the glowing em- 
bers, though no puff of wind could have been at 
once so noiseless and so effective. The intense 
burning went on with an energy astonishing to 
the young beholders. 
‘‘What splendid kindling that would make,’’ 
Emile remarked, ‘‘for starting up a fire when it gets 
low! All you ’d have to do would be to throw on 
a handful, and the wood or coal would be all ablaze.
-P-A-G-E-183
A TALK ON TOOLS 175 
You might work the bellows all day and not make 
it burn so.’’ 
‘‘F'rom the bellows,’’ replied Uncle Paul, ‘‘comes 
only air, in which nitrogen, a gas that does not help 
things to burn, is much more plentiful than oxygen, 
which alone helps on the burning. In this mixture 
the inert or useless gas considerably weakens the 
effect of the active or useful gas. But chlorate of 
potash, on being decomposed by heat, sends out a 
breeze, as we might say, of pure oxygen; and that 
is why the coals here burned just now with so much 
intensity. With this kindling, as Emile calls it, a 
fire gains in vigor and rapidity because the gas 
it feeds upon is mixed with nothing to weaken its 
effect.’’ 
More pinches of the chlorate were thrown upon 
the coals, and when the two young observers had 
seen how this easily melted substance quickened 
the fire by the release of oxygen, which escaped in 
bubbles, Jules told his uncle of something he and 
his brother had once noticed with much curiosity. 
‘‘One day,’’ said he, ‘‘I had taken a feather and 
swept off a handful of that white, moldy stuff that 
collects on cellar walls, when some one told me it 
was saltpeter and that saltpeter is used for making 
gunpowder. I dropped some on the live coals in the 
fireplace, and it made a quick, bright fire like that 
you made with the chlorate of potash. Does that 
fluffy stuff on damp walls give out oxygen when 
you put it on the fire?’’ 
‘“‘The fine white flakes such as you swept from 
 
-P-A-G-E-184
  176 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
the cellar walls are, in truth, saltpeter,—or, in 
chemical language, nitrate of potash. This sub- 
stance is, as its name shows you, a salt, containing 
oxygen in its acid part, which is nitric acids and 
also in its oxid, which is potash. When you throw 
it on the fire it decomposes, releasing its oxygen; 
and that explains why it makes any burning sub- 
stance burn so much faster than before. Thus, the 
saltpeter from damp walls acts in the same way as 
chlorate of potash; they both decompose, and in so 
doing give out in abundance the gas needed to make 
fire burn. I must let you know, however, that 
nitrate of potash is not a suitable substance from 
which to obtain oxygen, because it is not so readily 
decomposed as Jules’s experiment would seem to — 
indicate. To make this nitrate surrender its oxygen 
heat is not enough; it also requires some combus- 
tible matter, as wood or charcoal. Then the fuel 
seizes upon the oxygen as fast as it is released, 
and so the gas escapes us again, being taken and 
held captive in another compound. Consequently, 
nothing has been acomplished; what we wished to 
obtain has slipped out of our grasp and entered 
into a new combination. With chlorate of potash, 
on the contrary, heat alone is enough for our pur- 
pose, without the help of anything else that might 
appropriate the oxygen releasd by the salt.’’ 
‘‘Another question,’’ said Jules. 
‘‘As many as you like, my young friend. [I shall 
take pleasure in answering them, for I know before- 
hand that they will be well-considered questions, 
coming as they do from a thoughtful mind.”’
-P-A-G-E-185
A TALK ON TOOLS | 177 
‘When you threw the chlorate of potash on the 
coals, it first melted, then bubbled and let go its 
oxygen, and at last there was nothing left of it but 
a little white round piece that would n’t burn at all. 
What is that white stuff that is left on the coals?”’ 
‘‘Your question is well put, for it concerns a 
rather important matter. I had forgotten to explain 
this, but now I will repair the omission. This re- 
mainder, this bit of white crust that fire has no 
effect upon, comes from the chlorate of potash when 
the latter is decomposed by heat. What did this 
chlorate contain to start with? Three elements, 
the chlorin in the chloric acid, the potassium in the 
oxid of potassium, and the oxygen in both. Of 
these three elements, one, oxygen, has disappeared. 
There remain then, the chlorin and the potassium, 
united in a compound very different from the 
original chlorate. This compound is called chlorid 
of potassium. 
‘“‘This gives me an opportunity to teach you a 
new rule in the grammar of chemistry. The vari- 
ous metalloids can combine, one by one, with the 
various metals. In the case of oxygen, for example, 
the combination with a metal is called an oxid, as 
you already know; and so of the other metalloids, 
sulphur, chlorin, phosphorus, etec., the name of the 
compound is formed by adding the ending zd to the 
name, or the chief part of the name, of the metal- 
loid, after which comes the name of the metal pre- 
ceded by the preposition of. In the substance be- 
fore us we have chlorin and potassium in combina- 
tion; in other words, we have chlorid of potassium. 
 
-P-A-G-E-186
  178 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
But enough of this, and perhaps too much; let us 
return to the subject of oxygen. 
‘“We have to find out, if possible, how an un- 
skilled experimenter may hope to obtain, without 
too much difficulty, the gas stored up in the chlorate 
of potash. He should first procure a glass re- 
ceiver of some sort, and in this the decomposition 
is to take place. A medicine-bottle, short and as 
wide as possible, will answer the purpose, provided 
the glass is not only thin, but of uniform thinness 
throughout. A glass vessel exposed to heat will re- 
main unbroken only if it complies with these re- 
quirements. The thinner it is, the less likely is it to 
break under sudden variations of temperature. 
Look at this tumbler here: at the bottom it is as 
thick as your finger, but it is thin elsewhere. 
Plunged cold into hot water, or hot into cold water, 
it would run great risk of breaking. On the other 
hand, a piece of glass of even thinness comes out 
intact from a similar test. Let us, then, choose the 
thinnest bottle we can find, and above all one that 
has no thick places in the glass as are often found 
in the bottom of an ordinary bottle. The success 
of our experiment depends greatly on our choice.’’ 
‘‘T should have thought,’’ said Emile, ‘‘a thick, 
strong glass would be the kind to use. It would 
stand the strain better.’’ 
‘“Yes, if it were a question of resisting shock or 
of not melting under heat. But here it is not a 
question of resistance to shock, as I take for granted 
the operator is sufficiently skilled not to bump his  
-P-A-G-E-187
  A TALK ON TOOLS 179 
receiver against any hard object; nor is the danger 
of melting worthy of consideration, the heat re- 
quired for decomposing the chlorate being insuffici- 
ent to fuse or even soften the glass. Our bottle, 
then, will not have to withstand shocks, and it will 
not have to bear any excessive heat, though it will 
undoubtedly undergo changes of temperature sud- 
den enough to break it unless we guard against such 
an accident by selecting a bottle of very thin glass.’’ 
‘But what if, after all, the bottle full of chlorate 
should break over the fire; what would happen 
then?’’ 
‘‘Nothing very serious. We should simply have 
to let it alone and watch the beautiful fireworks re- 
sulting from the release of so much oxygen on burn- 
ing coals. We should witness on a large scale what 
you saw when I put a few pinches of the chlorate 
on a handful of glowing embers.’’ 
‘‘And then?”’ 
‘“Then we should begin again with another bottle; 
that ’s all. But better than a medicine bottle, which 
I should unhesitatingly use if I had nothing more 
suitable, is a receiver called in chemistry a balloon. 
It is a vessel of clear glass, round in shape, with 
a neck about as long as your hand is broad, and it 
can be had for a few cents at the druggist’s, or 
some chemist might spare us one from his labora- 
tory. Here is the balloon we are going to use; it 
‘is one of my recent purchases in town.’’ 
‘That looks like one of those candy bottles they 
always have for selling candy to the children at
-P-A-G-E-188
  180 'THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
village fairs. For two cents you can buy the whole 
thing, candy and bottle and all.’’ 
‘¢Your candy bottle would do very well here if it 
were larger; but what could not well be replaced by 
anything else is the tube for conveying the gas from 
the balloon into the bell-glass. The tube is made 
of glass, and may be had of the druggist, who will 
perhaps furnish the complete outfit we need, all 
ready for use, or we might apply to some chemist 
friend. But, after all, our best course is to make 
our apparatus for ourselves, and then we shall be 
sure to have it in all respects as it should be for the 
successful performance of our experiment. At the 
druggist’s we find straight glass tubes of a meter 
and more in length. 
We select several 
about as large round 
as a lead pencil and 
made of thin and 
colorless glass, which 
softens much more 
readily with heat than does greenish glass. Let us 
examine the thickness of the glass. If in cross- 
section it looks thin and colorless, it is what we, 
with our limited resources for working in glass, are 
seeking. A thick green glass would be too un- 
manageable for us. Providing ourselves, there- 
fore, with a few of these straight tubes of thin, clear 
glass, we next proceed as follows: 
‘‘To cut from the straight tube any desired length, 
we first take a triangular file and make a little 
groove all around the tube at the point where it is 
   
-P-A-G-E-189
  A TALK ON TOOLS 181 
to be broken, then, taking the tube in both hands, 
we hold the grooved part against the edge of a 
table and exert a gentle pressure. The break is 
made instantly, round and clean. Now it remains 
to fashion this broken-off piece so as to give it the 
shape suitable for our experiment. All we have to 
do is to bend it at various points after first soften- 
ing it at those points by heat. With easily melted 
glass this may be done with the help of a handful of 
live coals blown to glowing heat by the breath; but 
the operation goes better if we use an alcohol lamp. 
This is simply a metal or glass cup or holder con- 
taining alcohol into which runs a wide cotton wick, 
the exposed end of which is lighted. The part of 
the tube to be softened is held to the flame by taking 
one end of the tube in each hand and turning it be- 
tween the fingers so that the heat may get at it all 
round. As soon as the glass seems soft enough to 
bend, a slight exertion of strength will produce the 
elbow desired, which may then be left to cool off 
slowly. 
‘“‘The tube thus bent is to be attached to the 
balloon by means of a stopper with a hole through 
it, the stopper being one that fits tightly and allows 
no gas to escape. This perfect stoppage is neces- 
sary in handling oxygen and other gases, so subtle 
is their nature. The smallest possible opening is 
big enough for them to get through. Hence the 
stopper must be fitted with extreme nicety. I will 
explain how to do it. 
‘*Select a stopper of fine cork, as uniform in its 
structure as possible, and without any of those
-P-A-G-E-190
  
  182 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
holes or decayed spots that are found in cork of 
poor quality. With some heavy object, the first 
to come to hand, such as a round stone or a hammer 
or anything else of the sort, first give the stopper 
a few light blows to soften it and make it supple. 
Then with a coarse iron wire pointed at one end, 
and heated red-hot if you choose, for the sake of 
easier and quicker execution, pierce the stopper 
lengthwise, making a small hole for the guidance 
of the file with which it is to be enlarged. This 
latter, called a rat-tailed file from its shape, is 
round and should not be of greater caliber than the 
tube that is to pass through the cork. With this 
file you then carefully enlarge, perfect, and smooth 
the channel in the cork until the tube will pass 
through under gentle pressure and fill it exactly. 
Now take your cork in hand again and shape the 
outside to fit tightly into the neck of the balloon. 
With a coarse flat file you first rasp it lengthwise 
to make it regular in shape and slightly tapering. 
When thus reduced to the proper size, it is finished 
off with a finer file, being worn down and smoothed 
until it fits perfectly into the neck of the balloon. 
Observe that no knife or other edged tool, however 
sharp, could do the work of the file in thus pre- 
paring the stopper, for the cork would be cut un- 
evenly and the result would be an escape of gas. 
An accurately fitting stopper is indispensable to 
success. In future, then, we will count as neces- 
sary to our laboratory equipment four files,— 
namely, a fine triangular one for notching the glass 
tube so that any desired length may be broken off;
-P-A-G-E-191
  A TALK ON TOOLS 183 
a round one for enlarging the hole made in the cork 
by the iron wire; a coarse flat one for rasping the 
outside of our stopper and giving it a preliminary 
shaping’; and, lastly, a fine flat one for finishing and 
smoothing.”’ 
During these explanations the speaker’s hand 
helped out his words, example accompanied precept, 
and the tube was bent in the flame of the alcohol 
lamp, the stopper was pierced and filed and finished, 
and in a short time everything was in readiness. 
‘‘Our apparatus is now in order,’’ said he, ‘‘and 
we will put it to use. But first a brief word of 
explanation will not be out of place. Heat alone 
suffices to decompose chlorate of potash and make 
it give up its oxygen, although toward the end of the 
operation the salt becomes obstinate and, in order 
to obtain all the gas, must be heated to such a tem- 
perature as would endanger our balloon by soften- 
ing the glass. I hold it of the first importance, and 
you will agree with me, that we should not damage 
our apparatus, as our resources do not admit of 
our sacrificing a balloon every time we want a little 
oxygen. Besides, it is much more convenient to 
operate with less heat. Well, then, chemistry tells 
us that by mixing the chlorate with some black sub- 
stance that will distribute the heat evenly through- 
out the whole mass the complete decomposition of the 
salt may be easily accomplished. A handful of live 
coals will under these conditions give enough heat, 
and the balloon will not be exposed to any danger. 
‘‘My speaking just now of a black substance per- 
haps made you think of coal-dust. Beware, my dear 
 
-P-A-G-E-192
  184 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
boys, of mixing anything of that sort with the 
chlorate and then heating the mixture, if you do 
not wish to be disfigured by a violent explosion. 
Those two substances make a dangerous mixture. 
And why? The reason is plain. On being heated, 
the chlorate gives out oxygen, and this gas, min- 
gling with an inflammable powder such as coal-dust, 
will not fail to produce a sudden explosion that 
would blow our apparatus to pieces. Nothing that 
can burn should be mixed with the chlorate, the risk 
involved being too great. Bear this well in mind. 
‘What, then, shall be the black powder for mak- 
ing quicker and easier the decomposition of our 
chlorate? It must be something that will not burn; 
something that, having already been burned, that is 
united with oxygen, will no longer catch fire. The 
best thing for our purpose is a metal oxid. There 
is found in certain mines—and the druggist sells it 
for a trifle—an intensely black powder called dioxid 
of manganese. Manganese itself is a metal much 
like iron, rarely found in a pure state, and hardly 
ever used in that form. United with oxygen, it forms 
various compounds, the second of which in abund- 
ance of oxygen is the dioxid I have mentioned, which 
is what we require for mixing with our chlorate to 
help on its decomposition. With this black sub- 
stance we incur no risk; fed up, so to speak, with the 
gas that makes things burn, it can take on no more, 
a fact that removes all danger of any excessive 
combustion within our apparatus. 
‘* Accordingly, I place on a sheet of paper a good- 
sized handful of chlorate of potash, a little less of 
 
-P-A-G-E-193
A TALK ON TOOLS 185 
dioxid of manganese, mix the two together, and 
pour the mixture into a balloon of the size of a large 
orange. The tube with its stopper is then adjusted, 
and the apparatus, supported by a triangle of stout 
iron wire, is placed on a brazier. 
‘Here will occur a slight difficulty that must be 
overcome before we can proceed. Our oxygen is 
to be collected in wide-mouthed bottles or jars, full 
of water and inverted in the bowl of water so as to 
bring the free end of our glass tube directly under 
the mouth of the inverted bottle or jar, and the 
latter must accordingly be held in a tilted position. 
But this is tiring to the arm if the operation is of 
any length, and it would be better if the inverted 
bottle could be made to stand erect on some sup- 
port. But how, in such a position, can a passage 
be left open for the end of the tube conveying the 
gas from the balloon? Nothing simpler. Let us 
take a small flower-pot having a hole, as is usual, 
in the bottom; then by breaking off some of the 
upper part of the pot we can lessen its height and 
obtain a sort of cup only a few fingers tall. No 
matter if the edge of this cup is irregular or even 
jagged; it will do if it stands firm and if its up- 
turned bottom offers a level support for the inverted 
bottle or glass jar. Finally we make a deep notch 
in the side, and the support for our bottle is ready. 
We place it in the middle of the bowl, the flat bottom 
upward, and through the notch in its side we pass 
the end of our glass tube, which will thus emit the 
released oxygen within the enclosure of the support- 
ing pot. On the latter will rest the inverted bottle 
 
-P-A-G-E-194
186 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
or jar full of water, and the gas will gain access to 
it through the round hole in the support. 
‘‘Hinough, my little friends, on this subject. Our 
apparatus is harder to explain than to make. I 
promise you for to-morrow some experiments that 
will richly repay you for the dry preparations of 
to-day. And now get me one more sparrow, if you 
please. Set your snares in the bed of peas. As 
the captive bird will not share the sad fate of its 
predecessor, there is nothing to dread in our com- 
ing experiment.’’ 
   
-P-A-G-E-195
CHAPTER XIV 
OXYGEN 
T last they were about to see this famous 
A gas, oxygen, this king of elements that in the 
past few days had again and again been referred 
to by Uncle Paul in his talks, but always wrapped in 
the mystery that enshrouds the unknown. Now it 
was to be released from its imprisonment in the 
chlorate of potash and subjected to tests that 
promised to be interesting. Emile even dreamed 
about it in the night, so much had his mind dwelt 
on this gas that makes things burn. In his dreams 
he saw the glass balloon and the bent tube cutting 
up all sorts of silly capers on the circular edge of 
the brazier, while the irascible chlorate and its com- 
rade, the dioxid, looked on curiously through the 
glass walls of their prison. In the presence of the 
real things about which he had dreamed the night be- 
fore—confronting, that is, the various preparations 
for the coming experiment—the boy was moved to 
fresh laughter when his uncle put the balloon in 
place over the live coals. 
They had not long to wait. Before it seemed 
possible that the heat could have had time to act, 
and with no visible change in the contents of the 
balloon, the water in the bowl began to bubble at 
187 
 
-P-A-G-E-196
  188 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
the end of the tube, a sure sign that gas was being 
set free. The support already made from the bot- 
tom of a flower-pot was arranged in position in the 
bowl of water, and a large bottle of two or three 
liters’ capacity and with a wide mouth was filled. 
brimming full of water, stopped with the palm of 
the hand, and turned upside down on the support. 
Emile steadied it with his hand. The gas passed 
through the hole in the middle of the support, and 
rose through the water in a tumultuous and unin- 
terrupted series of big bubbles, so that in a few 
moments the sh was filled with the gas that had 
i displaced the water. 
Then Unele Paul 
took a tumbler, 
plunged it into the 
bowl, and in this 
glass of water 
eins sme = set the mouth 
| of the bottle, of 
course without letting it come out into the air and 
lose any of the imprisoned oxygen. That done, the 
bottle, standing upside down in the glass of water, 
which served to exclude the air from outside, was 
set safely away in a corner of the room to wait until 
it was needed for some experiment still to come. A 
second bottle took its place in the bowl, was filled 
with gas in the same way, and set aside for future 
use, after which a third and then a fourth went 
through the same operation. The supply of oxygen 
in the balloon seemed inexhaustible. 
‘‘There seems to be a lot of oxygen in a handful 
         
 
-P-A-G-E-197
OXYGEN 189 
of chlorate,’? remarked Emile, surprised at the 
quantity of gas being released. 
‘‘Yes, it is no small amount, as you see, for our 
four bottles hold almost a dozen liters, taken to- 
gether.’’ 
‘‘And those dozen liters of oxygen were all in 
that little heap of chlorate?’’ 
‘¢ All were in the small amount of chlorate used. 
Was n’t I right in calling this salt a rich storehouse? 
The chlorate is more than abundantly fed with 
oxygen; it is crammed to the limit. The gas taken 
captive by chemical combination is compressed in 
great quantities into very small bulk. But all is 
not over yet; I hope to fill this bottle, too.’’ 
Therewith Uncle Paul placed on the support in 
the bowl an odd-looking, elongated bottle that had 
hardly any neck, being of nearly the same width at 
top and bottom. He did not say where it came 
from, but his nephews thought they recognized it 
as an old pickle-jar. They were smiling at seeing 
this homely utensil pressed into such serious 
service, when their uncle resumed his talk. 
‘‘Does my tall jar make you laugh? Because 
it once held pickles, do you think it unworthy now 
to hold oxygen? Away with such false pride, my 
lads! Let us use the things at hand and not sigh for 
expensive luxuries. But for this once we will carry 
out our program in a worthy manner, just as we 
should if we had a better-equipped laboratory at 
our disposal. 
‘‘Here is something that chemists call a gage 
It is a tall glass cylinder with a base to stand on.
-P-A-G-E-198
1909 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
a proceed to fill it with oxygen while there is still 
some left in the balloon, and we see that the gas 
enters slowly, the supply being nearly exhausted. 
In the balloon, the contents of which show no change 
in appearance, there is left the dioxid of_man- 
ganese just as it was when I put it there. It has 
suffered neither loss nor gain, but it has promoted 
the decomposition of the chlorate by enabling the 
heat to act upon it evenly. The balloon itself, too, 
remains uninjured and ready for further use when 
needed. As to the chlorate, it has now lost all its 
oxygen, and is thus changed to that white substance 
we saw yesterday remaining on the embers after we 
had thrown on a pinch of chlorate and watched it 
quicken the fire. In short, it has turned into chlorid 
of potassium. So much for that. Now let us put 
our supply of oxygen to some use, beginning with 
that in the gage.’’ 
Carried from the bow] to the table with the usual 
precautions—that is, being first closed with the palm 
of the hand while still standing upside down in 
the water—the gage was set upright on its base 
and covered with a piece of glass pending certain 
preparations consisting of fastening a short piece 
of candle to an iron wire, as had been done before 
in the experiment with nitrogen. Uncle Paul lighted 
the candle, allowed the flame to get bright and full, 
and then blew it out; but the wick was still glowing 
from the combustion that had been so suddenly 
arrested. 
‘‘The candle which I have just blown out,’’ said 
he, ‘‘but which still shows a red glow at the end
-P-A-G-E-199
OXYGEN 191 
of the wick, I am going to lower into the oxygen 
in the gage. What will happen? We shall see.’’ 
Removing the piece of glass, he suited the action 
to the word. Piff! A slight explosion was heard 
and the candle, relighting itself unaided, burned 
with radiant brilliance. It was extinguished once 
more, the wick still retaining its glowing spark, and 
lowered again into the gage of oxygen. Another 
pif! and the flame reappeared, burning with re- 
markable brightness. Again and again, with care 
to leave the wick slightly aglow, the candle, extin- 
guished with a breath, quickly relighted itself when 
it was lowered into the oxygen. Each time a little 
explosion preceded the revival of the flame. Emile 
clapped his hands with delight at this repeated re- 
newal of the flame, always so prompt and so com- 
plete. 
‘*How different it was with nitrogen, the partner 
of oxygen in the air we breathe,’’ he observed. 
‘‘Oxygen relights all of a sudden what is just about 
to stop burning altogether, but. nitrogen puts out 
what is already well on fire. Couldn’t I try my 
hand at this fine experiment, Uncle?’’ 
‘Surely; why, not? But I must inform you that 
the oxygen in the gage is by this time nearly ex- 
hausted, the candle having used up a little every 
time it was relighted.”’ 
‘*But there ’s plenty more in those four bottles.’’ 
‘‘T am keeping that for other experiments of still 
greater importance.’’ 
‘What shall I do, then?’’ 
‘You must content yourself with my old pickle- 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
    192 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
jar that I took the pains to fill with oxygen, count- 
ing on it to take the place of a regular gage.’’ 
‘‘T ll do that and be glad to.’’ 
‘‘A wise decision, for the old pickle-jar will 
render you yeoman service. My chief reason for 
using it is to show you, by adding example to ex- 
ample, that instructive experiments are possible 
even with the commonest utensils. Our gage here 
is a luxury, an unheard-of extravagance in our little 
village. Almost any kind of bottle, any caper- or 
pickle-jar, provided only it has a wide mouth to 
admit the candle, would serve very well in per- 
forming the striking experiment you now wish to 
repeat. All right, then; you shall repeat it.’’ 
‘The jar being placed on the table, Emile began 
the lighting and relighting of the candle, blowing 
it out and rekindling the flame again and again. 
The experiment had not gone better even with the 
regular gage. 
‘There, now,’’ said his uncle, ‘‘does n’t my pickle- 
jar answer the purpose admirably?”’ 
‘*Yes, splendidly.’’ 
‘*Tt is the contents and not the container that we 
should give our attention to. If we supply it with 
oxygen the candle will relight itself, no matter what 
the oxygen is in, whether the chemist’s gage or the 
paltry pickle-bottle. As a close to the experiment, 
leave the candle in the jar to burn as long at it 
can. You will see how fast it will be used up.’’ 
And, indeed, the candle, immersed in oxygen, did 
not fail to burn with devouring rapidity. It showed 
no longer the calm flame that is maintained in ordi-
-P-A-G-E-201
OXYGEN 198 
nary air, but a furious tongue of fire, extraordinarily 
bright and excessively hot, making the wax melt 
and run down in big drops. The substance of the 
candle was literally devoured rather than burned, 
and it was evident that in a few minutes there would 
be consumed in this energetic gas enough wax to 
last an hour in atmospheric air. Finally the flame 
died down for lack of oxygen, and Uncle Paul re- 
sumed his talk. 
‘‘Before continuing these spectacular experi- 
ments with oxygen,’’ said he, ‘‘let us quiet our 
emotions with a little interlude. You know the 
characteristics that enable us to recognize an acid,— 
first the sour taste, and then the property of turn- 
ing blue flowers red. But it is not always practic- 
able to test an acid by the sense of taste, the flavor 
being sometimes very weak or even quite imper- 
ceptible. The test with blue flowers is a better one. 
But, unfortunately, violets and other blue flowers 
redden with some difficulty when the acid is weak. 
Chemistry has found the blue coloring matter of 
lichens more easily affected. You know those pe-” A 
culiar growths that look like flaky crusts on the 
bark of trees and even on the surface of the hardest 
rocks. They are of vegetable origin, and are called 
lichens. One species found on rocks near the sea 
furnishes a blue substance called litmus. The drug- 
gist has this for sale in the form of little cubes, ashy- 
blue in color and known as litmus tablets. If you 
dissolve one of these in a little water, you obtain 
a pale violet-blue liquid called tincture of litmus. 
‘“‘This tincture is one of the most convenient 
 
-P-A-G-E-202
194 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
tests 1 for applying to acids, as it reddens much 
more easily than do blue flowers. To illustrate, I 
pour into this glass two fingers of the litmus tinc- 
ture; then I dip the end of a glass tube or of a 
common straw into the acid in this bottle, an acid 
I have already referred to as derived from sul- 
phur,—sulphurie acid, in fact. I do not dip it 
deeply, but merely touch it to the liquid, and with 
this barely moistened straw I stir the blue tinc- 
ture, which immediately turns red in proof (if I 
.did not already know it) that what my bottle con- 
tains is an acid.”’ | 
‘‘If the tincture of litmus is turned red by an- 
acid,’’ said Jules, ‘‘it ought to be turned green by 
a soluble oxide, just as violets are; and so it would 
help us to find out whether a thing was an oxid or 
not:’’ | 
‘‘It is perfectly natural to expect that, after see- 
ing what happens to blue flowers; and yet it is not 
the case. Lime and other soluble oxids do not turn 
the blue of litmus green, but leave it unchanged 
However, this lack is atoned for by another char- 
acteristic. Once reddened by an acid, litmus. is 
turned blue again by means of a soluble oxid. 
Into the contents of this glass, just now changed 
from blue to red by the addition of sulphuric acid, 
I drop a tiny particle of lime, and the liquid re- 
turns to its original blue. A second time I apply 
a trace of the acid with the end of this straw, anda 
second time the tincture turns red. Lime being

applied in its turn once more, the blue color reap- 
pears. These changes from blue to red and from 
red to blue might be repeated indefinitely. Here 
we have, then, a perfect test for determining ~~ whether a substance is an acid or an oxid, provided 
only, of course, that it is soluble in water. at- 
ever reddens the blue tincture of litmus is an acid, 
and what restores its blue to the tincture previously 
reddened by acid is an oxid 
‘“‘Tf we had no litmus—and the lack of it would 
be no great matter—we should have to be contented 
with blue flowers. A bunch of violets would first 
be crushed and stirred in water, and the bluish 
liquid thus obtained would be strained and set 
aside to serve the purpose of litmus. But it would 
show a difference in one respect; though acids would 
turn it red, oxids would not turn it blue again, but 
green; and of course the blue liquid would turn 
green immediately when acted upon by an oxid, 
without having to be previously reddened by an 
acid. It is to be noted, further, that weak acids 
might not be able to change the blue of violets to 
red, and therefore litmus is preferable as a test. 
‘‘Our interlude is over and we will go on with the 
performance. We are going to burn several sub- © 
stances in oxygen and watch their manner of burn- 
ing. First comes sulphur. 
‘Adopting the method you saw employed when 
we tried in vain to make phosphorus and sulphur 
burn in a’bottle filled with nitrogen, I make a little 
cup out of a bit of broken earthenware, and bend 
the end of an iron wire into a circle for holding this 
 
-P-A-G-E-204
  196 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
cup. The iron wire is then passed through a large 
cork stopper that will serve to hold it in place in 
the bottle rather than to stop up the bottle itself. 
Hence it does not matter much if the cork is too 
large for the bottle. A small disk of stout card- 
board laid over the mouth of the bottle would 
answer just as well. The end of the wire, project- 
ing above the supporting cork or cardboard, will 
serve as a handle for lowering or raising the cup 
so as to bring it into or near the center of the bottle, 
in the midst of the supply of oxygen.”’ 
Having finished these preparations, Uncle Paul 
carefully took up one of the large bottles in reserve, 
together with the glass full of water in which it 
stood and which served to close its mouth. These, 
without disturbing their relative position, he carried 
to the bowl, and there, under water, the glass was 
removed and replaced by the palm of the hand ap- 
plied to the bottle’s mouth. In this way it was 
possible to set the bottle upright on the table with- 
out bringing its contents into communication with 
the outside air. A small sheet of glass laid over 
the mouth closed the bottle, serving as it had done 
before as a temporary stopper. By means of the 
iron wire passing through the cork stopper, the 
cup, which had previously been filled with small 
fragments of sulphur, was so adjusted that it would 
take its proper place in the bottle when all was 
ready for it. Then Uncle Paul set fire to the sul-. 
phur and lowered the cup containing it into the 
oxygen. ‘Thus suspended in the middle of the bottle 
and held there by its cork support, the cup of 
 
-P-A-G-E-205
  OXYGEN 197 
sulphur required no further attention on the part 
of the experimenter, and there was nothing more 
to do but watch the result. 
Every one knows how slowly and with what a 
dim light sulphur burns under ordinary conditions. 
Hence the novelty of the spectacle now presented 
to the astonished gaze of the two young chemists. 
At their unele’s bidding the shutters had been 
closed, so that no daylight should get in and dim 
the splendor of the burning sulphur. It burned 
with an ardor unapproached by any brimstone 
match that was ever made. A fantastic radiance of 
a beautiful violet blue, rivaling in purity the rain- 
bow’s purple stripe, emanated from this wonderful 
illuminant and filled the room with so strange a 
glow that one might have fancied oneself trans- 
ported to some other world where the sun is blue. 
‘‘Maegnificent, magnificent!’’ cried Emile, clap- 
ping his hands with enthusiasm. 
The fumes of burning sulphur, escaping in puffs 
from the bottle and almost suffocating in their in- 
tensely pungent odor, tended somewhat to spoil this 
fairy-like illumination, otherwise so perfect; and so 
Unele Paul, as soon as the flame began to die down, 
had the shutters and windows opened. 
‘*Tt is all over,’’ said he; ‘‘the sulphur has used 
up its supply of oxygen. I will not dwell on the 
splendors you have just witnessed, as your eyes 
have done better justice to them than could any 
words of mine. They have told you that sulphur— 
burns in oxygen with a heat and_a_brilliance-that 
it_does not have when burning in ordinary air. 1 
 
-P-A-G-E-206
  
  198 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
will pass on to inquire what has become of the sul- 
-phur we have just seen burning so brightly. What 
has resulted from its combination with oxygen? 
The result is an invisible gas with a pungent odor, 
a gas that makes one cough,—the same gas, in. 
fact, that comes from a lighted match. A little © | 
of it has escaped into the room—our sense of smell 
and our coughing tell us that—but a good deal is 
still left in the bottle. Let us consult our tincture 
of litmus and see what information it will give us. 
I pour a little into the bottle and shake it up, where- 
upon the blue color immediately turns red. What 
does the litmus say?’’ 
‘*It says that the sulphur has turned into an acid 
by burning,’’ replied Jules. 
‘‘And it’s a good thing it does say so,’’ put in 
Emile, ‘‘for it would n’t have been very pleasant to 
taste it; and, besides, you can’t even see it. That 
litmus is certainly a convenient thing to have 
around.”’’ 
‘*Very convenient,’’ assented his uncle. ‘‘Here 
is something that can be neither felt nor seen, and 
yet a very real thing that takes you by the throat 
and makes you cough worse than if you had the 
whooping-cough. We wish to know what it is, and 
our litmus on being consulted answers: ‘It is an 
acid.’ ”? 
‘“Does it say, too, that it is sour?’’ 
‘‘Undoubtedly. What reddens litmus and blue 
flowers, is always sour.’’ 
‘‘But how make sure that the litmus and the 
 
-P-A-G-E-207
  OXYGEN 199 
violets tell the truth? I can’t stick my tongue down 
into the middle of the bottle.’’ 
' “The invisible gas from the burnt sulphur will 
- mix with water, and so a good deal of it is absorbed 
  in the tincture of litmus that I shook up in the 
bottle. We know this to be so from the effect it has 
on the tincture, which by itself is only water colored 
by a tiny particle of matter that has no flavor. 
Let us taste this liquid reddened by the intermix- 
ture of the gas, and we shall find out how our in- 
visible gaseous compound tastes. Wet your finger 
freely in it without fear of too large a dose. It 
takes a good deal to make any impression on the 
tongue.”’ 
With their uncle to set them an example the boys 
tasted the liquid several times to make sure they 
had its flavor. 
‘‘Weak vinegar,’’ pronounced Emile, smacking 
his lips; ‘‘very weak vinegar.’’ 
‘‘Weak, if you like, but still vinegar,—that is to 
say, acid.’’ 
‘*Tt ’s nothing like so strong as phosphoric acid; 
that eats away your very flesh.’’ 
‘‘Our sense of taste, then, agreeing with the tinc- 
ture of litmus, tells us that sulphur by combining 
with oxygen in burning becomes an acid. It is 
this invisible gas, therefore, that has that pungent 
odor and makes us cough; and it is called sulphur- 
ous acid.’? 
‘*You told us,’’ said Jules, ‘‘of another acid made 
from sulphur, sulphuric acid, which you just used
-P-A-G-E-208
  200 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
to turn the tincture red.. Then sulphur makes two 
acids, does it?’’ | 
‘*Yes, my boy, sulphur makes two acids, one with 
less oxygen and one with more. The one with less 
oxygen, and so the weaker, the less sour, is sulphur- 
ous acid; the other, richer in oxygen and therefore 
stronger and sourer, is sulphuric acid. By simply 
burning, either in ordinary air or in pure oxygen, 
sulphur takes on a certain amount of oxygen and 
no more, being thus changed to sulphurous acid; 
but by roundabout methods known to chemistry 
it can be made to take a larger dose, and in doing 
so it becomes sulphuric acid. Enough about sul- 
phur. Let us next see what will be the result of 
burning charcoal in oxygen.’’ 
A piece of charcoal no bigger than one’s little 
finger was fastened to one end of an iron wire and 
the other end passed through a small disk of eard- 
board that was to rest on the mouth of the bottle 
of oxygen. Uncle Paul then lighted the charcoal 
in the flame of a candle, but only enough to make it 
glow at one little point, and in this condition he 
lowered it into a fresh bottle of oxygen, conducting 
the operation in the same manner as with the sul- 
phur. 
The spectacle that followed rivaled in beauty the 
one just applauded so enthusiastically by Emile. 
At the point kindled by the candle, a spark so 
faint as to be hardly visible, a flame burst forth,— 
bright, ardent, irresistible,—and, spreading rapidly 
through the charcoal, soon turned it into a daz- 
zling little forge. It gave an intensely white light, 
 
-P-A-G-E-209
  OXYGEN 201 
with little sparks snapping and darting in all direc- 
tions, like so many shooting stars shut up in the 
bottle. It had taken but an instant to set the char- 
coal all aglow in a way impossible with any draft 
of ordinary air. Without moving his eyes from 
this brilliant spectacle, Emile gave utterance to 
his thoughts: 
‘“‘This heat and this bright light and these sparks 
I can make come when I blow with the bellows on 
burning charcoal. At the spot just under the nozzle 
of the bellows the charcoal burns almost as brightly 
as this, here, in the bottle.’’ 
“That is quite natural,’’ rejoined his uncle. 
‘‘With the bellows you send out air,—that is to say, 
oxygen mixed with a good deal of nitrogen, this 
latter weakening the effect. But by a sufficiently 
rapid renewal of this air that helps things to burn, 
the glowing charcoal may be made to brighten up 
and look much like this before us in the bottle of 
pure oxygen.’’ 
The supply of oxygen being at last used up, the 
unconsumed charcoal turned dimmer and dimmer, 
and then quite black. The shutters, which had again 
been closed, were reopened to let in the daylight, 
the previous admission of which would have greatly 
lessened the effect of the spectacle. 
‘“What has become of the charcoal that was 
burnt up? That is the problem we must now 
solve,’? said Uncle Paul. ‘‘There is left in the 
bottle an invisible gas having scareely any odor; 
and if we trusted only our smell and eyesight, we 
might conclude that the contents of our bottle had
-P-A-G-E-210
  202 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
not changed in the least. But let us submit these 
contents to various tests more decisive than those 
of smell and sight, and we shall find that there has 
been a decided change. First, it is safe to predict 
that, if the charcoal which burned so brilliantly in 
the beginning will now no longer burn in the bottle, 
a lighted candle will not burn there any better. 
Watch. I lower this candle, well alight, into the 
bottle, and it is hardly inside the neck before it 
goes out. Consequently, there can be no more 
oxygen left, for if there were, the candle, as you 
know, would burn with a bright flame. 
‘Still another test: I pour into the bottle a little 
tincture of litmus and shake it up thoroughly so 
as to give the gas a chance to act on the liquid. 
The blue tincture changes its color to a very pale 
red. Shaken up with oxygen, the same tincture 
would not show the slightest change. Hence, we 
have here another acid made by burning something 
in oxygen. We are now convinced that the oxygen 
in the bottle has been converted into another gas, 
-.no less clear, no less invisible, but endowed with . 
very different properties; and this difference, it is 
_ plain enough, can be due only to the addition of 
charcoal (or carbon, which is virtually the same 
thing) to the oxygen. Hence we must conclude that 
in this gas, here in the bottle,—a gas so color- 
less that we cannot see it,—there is at least some 
slight quantity—of carbon, that substance known to 
us as hard and heavy when we see it in coal.’’ 
‘‘T see now that it must be so,’’ assented Emile; 
‘‘but if any one had told me, without being able to 
 
-P-A-G-E-211
    OXYGEN 203 
prove it, that there was carbon in a gas as invisible 
as air, I should n’t have been in a hurry to believe 
him. What do you say, Jules?”’ 
‘‘T say that it is hard to get used to the idea that a 
thing we can’t see or feel can have carbon in it. If 
Uncle Paul, instead of leading us step by step to 
where we are now, had begun by saying that there 
is carbon in this bottle in which I can see nothing 
at all, we should have looked at him in the greatest 
astonishment. But the proofs are there and can’t 
be got rid of. The charcoal in burning has changed 
to a gas that turns the litmus tincture red, and so it 
must be an acid called— Uncle hasn’t told us yet 
what it is called.’’ 
‘‘Consult your grammar of chemistry, and find the 
name for yourselves.”’ 
‘““That ’s so! I’d forgotten all about that. 
~ Charcoal is the same as carbon, and the ending ic 
added to carbon makes carbonic. The gas that 
comes from burning charcoal is carbonic acid.”’ 
‘‘Ts it sour like the others, this carbonic acid?’’ 
asked Emile. : 
‘‘Of course, but so slightly that in the gas we have 
here in our bottle this acid quality is barely percep- 
tible. The litmus, instead of turning a decided red, 
took on only a faint winy tinge, and to the sense of 
taste the sourness would be correspondingly feeble. 
But some day an opportunity will oceur to convince 
you that carbonic acid is indeed sour to the taste. 
Now let us put our third bottle of oxygen to its in- 
tended use. In it I propose to burn some iron, a 
thing that Emile was inclined to think impossible
-P-A-G-E-212
204 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
the other day. And I shall make this iron burn with- 
out having to heat it red-hot beforehand in a forge, 
as the blacksmith does with his iron before hammer- 
ing it into shape. I shall set it on fire with a piece 
of lighted tinder, as if it were a train of gunpowder.”’ 
‘¢ And the iron will catch fire just from that piece 
of tinder?’’ was Emile’s wondering inquiry. 
‘‘Certainly; gunpowder couldn’t do it better. 
Here is an old watchspring, broken at one end and 
of no further use. It is a bit of refuse I got at the 
clockmaker’s. But instead of this spring, which is 
admirably suited to the requirements of our next ex- 
periment on account of its thin flat ribbon-shape, 
offering plenty of surface to the action of the oxy- 
gen, we could use an iron wire about as fine as a 
medium-sized needle, first cleaning it well with a file 
or, better, with sandpaper. The watchspring, how- 
ever, is to be preferred. I begin by heating it over 
some live coals in order to take away its stiffness 
and make it supple. Then I wind it around a slender 
rod of some sort—a penholder or a lead-pencil will 
do—to give it a spiral or corkscrew form. Next I 
take a pair of stout scissors and cut one end of our 
corkscrew into a point, which I stick through a bit 
of tinder about as large as your finger-nail. Finally, 
the other end of the corkscrew is passed through a 
small disk of cardboard which will be placed over 
the bottle’s mouth and will hold the metal ribbon in 
position in the midst of the oxygen. The spiral of 
our corkscrew should be pulled out to such a length 
as to bring its lower end into the middle of the bottle. 
If a wire is used instead of a watchspring, the same 
 
-P-A-G-E-213
OXYGEN 205 
mode of operation should be followed,—the same 
winding of the wire into a corkscrew form, the wire 
being first heated if necessary and also (an indis- 
pensable detail) cleaned with sandpaper, and the 
‘same use of tinder attached to the lower end of the 
spiral.’’ 
All these arrangements being carefully completed, 
the third bottle of oxygen was set on the table. In 
preparing it, Uncle Paul had taken care not to fill 
this bottle entirely with the gas, but to leave several 
inches of water in the bottom. 
‘“There ’s some water in the bottle,’’ Emile pointed 
out, resolved not to let any detail of this curious 
experiment escape him. 
‘‘Yes, and it is there fora purpose. If there were 
none, some would have to be poured in now. A con- 
siderable depth of water at the bottom is necessary 
if we wish to keep our bottle for future experiments. 
You will very soon see why the water is needed. 
Close the shutters and I will begin.’’ 
As soon as the room had been darkened, the tinder 
was lighted and the spiral ribbon lowered into the 
oxygen. The tinder flared up suddenly and burned 
with a bright flame. Next followed a moment of in- 
decision; the iron was taking fire; then it was well on 
fire and presented the appearance of a piece of fire- 
works. This marvelous flame, feeding on metal, was 
seen to make its way upward in a spiral curve as a 
fire spreads from bottom to top of a winding stair- 
case. Snappings and cracklings and sprays of 
sparks accompanied the process. At the end of the 
ribbon there collected and hung suspended a globule 
  ee ——
-P-A-G-E-214
206 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
of molten metal of dazzling brightness. Growing too 
heavy, it detached itself and fell. Still intensely hot 
it plunged through the water with a sharp hissing 
sound and in a state of redness reached the bottom of 
the bottle, which it softened as it flattened itself out 
there. Other globules followed, dropping one by one | 
from the flaming spiral, and despite the cooling effect 
of the water the largest ones retained enough heat to 
melt the glass a little and sink into it. 
The boys stood silent before this magic spectacle 
of iron devoured by oxygen; but Emile was not with- 
out his fears. The hissing when the melted glob- 
ules fell, the failure of the water to extinquish im- 
mediately these drops of liquid fire, the snapping 
and sputtering of the burning watchspring, the 
showers of sparks and the cracking of glass, all 
united to furnish a spectacle of startling strange- 
ness. Holding his hands before his face to protect 
it, the boy was evidently expecting some terrific ex- 
plosion. But all ended very quietly, and only the 
bottle, cracked in several places, suffered any dam- 
age from this chemical celebration. Then Uncle 
Paul broke the silence that had ensued. 
‘‘Well, Emile, does iron burn? Are you con- 
vineed at last?’’ 
‘**T shall have to be,’’ he replied. ‘‘Iron burns, and 
it burns fast. It was like a little show of fireworks.”’’ 
‘And you, Jules,—what do you think of my ex- 
periment?’’ 
‘‘T think it even finer than the one with magne- 
sium. That metal made a light such as I had never 
seen before; but magnesium itself was something 
SFR tees Deptt thine li a a

new to us, and so it could not surprise us very much 
to see it burn. With iron the case is different: we 
are used to this metal and have so often seen it re- 
sist fire that when we see it burn like wood-shav- 
ings it strikes us both as something wonderful. But 
what surprised me most was to see those drops of 
melted iron stay red-hot for some moments under 
water.’’ 
‘‘Those globules that fell from the spiral as the 
flame ascended are not iron, but oxid of iron, 
formed by the combination of that metal with oxy- 
gen. I will take out of the bottle those that are not 
stuck to the glass. They consist, you see, of a black 
substance that crumbles easily in the fingers. If 
they were of iron alone, they would not do this. 
Their softness points to the presence of another ele- 
ment, and this element, as I said, is oxygen. You 
will find this same oxid of iron in the tiny scales, 
black and easily broken, that fly off when the black- 
smith hammers red-hot iron on his anvil. Both are 
iron that has been through fire, iron that has become 
oxidized. Notice also, on the inside surface of the / 
bottle, a light layer of fine reddish dust that was/ 
not there before. What can this red dust be? 
What does it look like?”’ 
‘*Tt looks a good deal like iron-rust,’’ replied Jules; 
‘fat least it has exactly the color of iron-rust.’’ 
‘¢And it is iron-rust,—that and nothing else. Re- 
member this little fact, for it will be useful to you 
later: iron-rust is iron combined with oxygen.’’ 
‘‘Then we » there two oxids of iron made in the 
bottle?’’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-216
  208 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
\ Yes, two, but in very unequal parts. The more 
~ abundant is the black substance; the other is the 
/ red dust deposited on the inner surface of the glass; 
and this latter is richer in oxygen than the other. 
I will not dwell on this subject further now, as I shall 
come back to it later. Notice, finally, the cracks 
in the bottom of the bottle and the globules of oxid 
embedded in the thick glass.’’ 
“Those drops of oxid must have been terribly 
hot,’’ said Emile, ‘‘to melt the glass like that after 
going through water. I ’ve often seen drops of fire 
fall from the fat when you singe a roast, but I never 
knew before that there could be ever so much hotter 
ones.’’ 
‘‘Was I right, then, to leave some water in the 
bottle???’ 
‘‘T should say so! If you hadn’t, the bottom would 
have been bored clear through.’’ 
‘‘More than that; the bottle would have been 
shattered to pieces by the sudden intense heat. The 
first drop to fall from the ribbon would have ended 
the experiment by breaking the bottle. But with 
this protecting layer of water our bottle has held 
together and, although cracked, can still be used.’’ 
There still remained a fourth bottle of oxygen. 
Also, safely caged and well supplied with bread 
crumbs, the sparrow was watching the proceedings. 
In the midst of plenty, captivity did not seem to de- 
press its spirits unduly. But now its turn had come 
to be experimented upon, though without any fatal 
ending in prospect this time, Uncle Paul had assured - 
his hearers. The death of the bird’s unlucky pre- 
 
-P-A-G-E-217
OXYGEN , 209 
decessor had shown the boys that nitrogen is un- 
breathable, and that in this gas in which a flame 
goes out life also is extinguished. What new truth 
was this sparrow to teach them? It was about to 
show them the effect of oxygen when breathed un- 
mixed with any other gas. Their uncle took the 
sparrow and put it into the remaining bottle of ox- 
ygen. 
At first nothing unusual occurred. Then, after 
a short interval, the saucy bird became even more 
alert, brisker in its movements, livelier in every way, 
than under natural conditions. Hopping about, 
flapping its wings, stamping with its feet, pecking 
the glass walls of its prison with furious beak, the 
little creature was evidently in a burning fever which 
was fast using up its strength. It panted as if its 
little breast would burst with the wild pulsations of 
its heart. Its open beak denoted extreme fa- 
tigue, and yet the feverish restlessness still in- 
creased. To prevent a sad ending to this 
scene, Uncle Paul hastened to put the bird back 
into its cage, where the fever subsided in a few 
minutes. | 
‘‘My demonstration is finished,’’ he announced: 
‘‘oxygen is a breathable gas; an animal can live 
in it; which is not the case with nitrogen. But life 
goes on more intensely in oxygen than is altogether 
agreeable, as we have just seen from the sparrow’s 
extraordinary agitation.”? - 
‘‘Never before,’’ said Jules, ‘‘have I seen a 
sparrow so worked up. It acted like one pos- 
sessed. Why did you take it out of the bottle so 
soon?’’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-218
  210 |THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
/“Because it would have killed the bird to keep it 
in there much longer.’’ 
‘‘Ts oxygen a gas that kills?’’ 
‘*On the contrary, it gives life.’ 
‘‘Well, then, I don’t see—’’ 
‘‘Recall the lighted candle that was lowered into 
oxygen. It went on burning there, but with a de- 
vouring ardor and an immoderate expenditure of 
wax. The flame was of superb brilliance and vigor, 
but of short duration. The fuel that would have 
kept it going a long time under ordinary conditions 
was used up in a few seconds. It is much the same 
with life; it goes at an unnatural pace in pure oxy- 
gen, uses itself up too rapidly to last long. We 
might express it by saying that the animal machine 
is geared too high, and hence, like all over-driven 
machines, breaks down and stops. “You saw how 
the bird performed all sorts of mad antics, as if 
violently intoxicated. At that rate its poor little 
machine would surely have gone to pieces very soon, 
and that is why I took the exhausted creature out 
of the bottle, wishing to keep it for another and 
final experiment. Take good care of it until to- 
morrow.’’
-P-A-G-E-219
CHAPTER XV 
AIR AND COMBUSTION 
HE next day the sparrow, quite recovered 
from its trying ordeal of the day before, did 
credit to Emile’s careful ministration by its vigor 
and appetite. The supply of oxygen being used up, 
Uncle Paul had his nephews prepare, under his su- 
pervision, a little more of that gas and also some 
nitrogen. Burning phosphorus under the bell-glass 
gave nitrogen, and the decomposition of chlorate 
of potash gave oxygen. The boys fairly beamed 
with joy at being allowed to take a hand in these 
momentous operations. All went off according 
to rule and with great success. It is true that their 
uncle was there all the time, advising and direct- 
ing; but it is also true that both Jules and Emile are 
unusually skilful with their hands. And so their 
uncle was not afraid to trust them with bell-glass, 
balloon, tubes, and bottle, for in hands so careful 
there was no danger of breakage. When the two 
gases had been collected the lesson began. 
“Oxygen is the only breathable gas,’’ said Uncle 
Paul, ‘‘the only one that will sustain animal life, 
and also the only one that will make fire burn. But 
its energies are too powerful, as was proved to you 
yesterday by the sparrow and the candle. These 
211 
 
-P-A-G-E-220
212 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
energies must be toned down by the addition of an 
inactive gas. When a wine is too heady, we weaken 
it with water to make a drink that will not injure 
our health: In the same way oxygen, too strong 
for breathing or for ordinary combustion when 
pure, must be weakened with nitrogen, an inactive 
gas. This mixture gives us atmospheric air, in 
which nitrogen plays the part corresponding to that 
of water in diluted wine. 
‘Our burning of phosphorus under the bell-glass | 
showed us that air is composed of two elements, oxy- 
gen and nitrogen, the quantity of the latter being 
four times that of the former. Now we are going 
to reverse the operation and make air out of the 
two elements here before us. Here in this bottle 
is oxygen, and there in that other is nitrogen. By 
mixing these two gases in the right proportion we 
ought to get air like that in which we live, air in 
which a candle will burn calmly and an animal 
breathe without danger. How are we to proceed in 
order to obtain this result? Our unduly strong 
wine,—that is, our oxygen,—must be diluted with 
a good deal of water, or nitrogen. In fact, we must 
add to the oxygen four times its volume of nitrogen. 
‘Nothing could be simpler. [ fill the bell-glass 
with water, and then cause a bottleful of oxygen to 
displace a part of the water. The bottle which is 
to serve as a common measure for both gases IL 
select at random, taking care, however, that it 
shall be of moderate size, so that the capacity of 
the bell-glass may not be exceeded when the two 
gases are mixed. Here we have, then, our oxygen 4"
-P-A-G-E-221
AIR AND COMBUSTION 213 
in the bell-glass; and now I fill the same bottle with 
nitrogen, which I release inside the bell-glass, and I 
do this four times. This accomplished, the bell- 
glass contains five bottlefuls of gas,—four of nitro- 
gen and one of oxygen, such being the proportions 
taught us by our experiment with phosphorus. Con- 
sequently, we have here a volume of gas in no way 
different from the air we breathe, as will be proved 
in the clearest possible manner by the two experi- 
ments we are now about to perform. 
‘‘With the gaseous mixture in the bell-glass I fill 
a gage or a small bottle, into which I lower a lighted 
candle. The candle continues to burn with its usual 
calmness, neither faster nor slower than in ordinary 
air. It behaves inside the gage just the same as it 
did outside. Our too strong wine is diluted just 
right. Diluted with nitrogen, the devouring oxygen 
shows by no means so keen an appetite; it consumes 
the candle quietly instead of making a little bon- 
fire of it. 
‘‘Let the sparrow tell us.the rest. I transfer the 
gas in the bell-glass to a large bottle with a wide 
mouth, after which I put in the bird. Does any- 
thing unusual follow? Nothing, you see. The little 
captive, transferred to a new prison, is rather dis- 
turbed and tries to escape, but shows no sign of 
painful breathing. Its breast rises and falls as 
usual, its beak is not open in sign of panting, there 
is no agitation to indicate suffering; in short, the 
sparrow breathes in its glass cage exactly as it did 
in its wicker one, thus proving that the air within 
is of the same kind as that outside. But to make it
-P-A-G-E-222
  214 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
still plainer to you that in this artificial atmosphere, 
the product of our skill, there is no danger of death, 
we will let the bird stay in the bottle a few minutes 
longer.’’ 
This, accordingly, was done. The boys, in some 
anxiety as to the result, watched the sparrow closely 
and were surprised to see its liveliness continue 
undiminished in an atmosphere made by themselves. 
The calmness shown by their uncle, who would have 
been the first to put an end to the experiment if 
there had been any risk to the patient, reassured 
them although they still had some slight misgivings, 
so deeply had they been impressed by the painful 
end of the other sparrow in the bottle of nitrogen. 
‘‘That will do,’’ said their uncle at last. ‘‘We 
know all we wished to know. Set the captive free.’’ 
Jules held the bottle, open, out of the window, 
and the, bird flew away as if nothing unusual had 
happened to it. With a few strokes of its wings it 
was on a neighboring roof, perhaps giving its com- 
rades an account of the strange things that had 
taken place in the chemical laboratory. 
‘‘What is it saying to them?’’ Emile wondered. 
‘*Ts it telling them about its glass cage and its crazy 
behavior and high fever in the oxygen?’’ Then to 
his uncle: ‘‘So the air the sparrow came out of is _ 
just the same as what we breathe?’’ 
‘*Yes, just the same. Composed, like it, of oxy- 
gen and nitrogen in the proportions I have already 
named, it maintains the candle-flame and also the 
life of the breathing animal. With oxygen and ni-
-P-A-G-E-223
AIR AND COMBUSTION 215 
trogen we made air exactly like the air that keeps 
us alive.’’ 
‘‘Then the air the sparrow breathed we could 
breathe too?”’ 
‘‘We could breathe it without perceiving the 
slightest difference, for, as I tell you, it is the same 
thing.’’ 
‘‘T asked because I thought it so strange we could 
live in air made by our own hands, with our drugs 
and our outfit of bottles and tubes. And there’s 
something else, stranger still, that came into my 
head. Let me tell you what it was. Our oxygen 
here was furnished by a salt, chlorate of potash, in 
which chemical combination had stored it up. You 
have told us that there are many other salts, all rich 
in oxygen, from which this gas could be obtained if 
it were n’t so hard to decompose them. One of these 
seems to me particularly interesting, the one used for. 
building houses.’’ 
‘“You mean limestone, carbonate of lime?’’ 
‘‘Yes, carbonate of lime. That salt has oxygen 
just like the others, has n’t it?’’ 
‘Without a doubt. What of it?’’ 
‘‘Well, if limestone has oxygen, the oxygen could 
be taken from it?’’ 
‘‘Tf absolutely necessary the thing could be done, 
but I warn you it would be enormously difficult in 
practice. ’’ 
‘No matter; it could still be done. Then we may 
think of chemistry as telling us that limestone can 
be breathed, and the idea of limestone ag just so 
 
-P-A-G-E-224
216 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
much air that we could breathe strikes me asrather , 
funny.’’ 
‘‘You go too far in imagining limestone could be 
made to furnish air such as we breathe; but it could 
, undoubtedly furnish oxygen. There is no impos- 
sibility in that.” | 
‘‘Could we really breathe air that is made partly 
out of limestone?’’ asked Jules, as surprised at his 
uncle’s answer as at Emile’s queer idea. 
‘“Why not? The sparrow, with more delicate or- 
gans of breathing than we, breathed air containing 
oxygen from chlorate of potash, another mineral 
substance,—in fact, another kind of stone. To ac- 
custom you a little to these curious changes and 
shiftings in which certain elements are used for one 
thing to-day, for another to-morrow, and for still a 
third the next day, with no ultimate loss or gain of 
a single particle of matter, listen to what I am going 
to tell you now that the opportunity occurs. 
‘“When the lime-burner fires the limestone in his 
furnace, the carbonic acid which it contains, and 
which is an invisible gas, escapes and is scattered 
far and wide in the atmosphere. Vegetables and » 
plants and trees feed on carbonic acid through their 
leaves. I simply state the fact here, postponing the 
demonstration until later. They take in from the 
air the carbonic acid coming from a thousand 
sources, the least of which, hardly counting at all, is 
the lime-kiln. They break it up, keep the carbon, 
and reject the oxygen in a pure state. This oxygen 
spreads through the atmosphere, becoming a part 
of our breathable air. Who, then, would venture to
-P-A-G-E-225
  AIR AND COMBUSTION 217 
deny that in a whiff of air breathed by us there may 
sometimes be a little oxygen from limestone,—from 
building-stone, in fact? The gas from stone such 
as is used in building may, indeed, sometimes help 
to keep us alive. The elements come and go between, 
one compound and another; substances cease to be, 
and in doing so give up their material to new sub- 
stances; the indestructible elements, released from 
one combination, reappear with properties un- 
changed in another. Whether it comes from air, 
chlorate of potash, plaster of Paris, iron-rust, mar- 
ble, or limestone, oxygen is always oxygen, nothing 
more and nothing less, provided it be disengaged 
from all chemical union. Thus the same gas can in 
‘urn rust a piece of iron, reduce a stick of wood to 
ashes, feed a flame, incorporate itself in a wayside 
pebble and there lose its activity, or send the blood 
coursing through an animal’s veins. Who knows 
whence comes the carbon in a mouthful of bread? 
What part may it not have played before entering 
into the wheat, and what part may it not play after- 
ward? We get lost when we try to follow in imagin- 
ation the travels of a bubble of oxygen or a lump of 
coal through all the things that are being contin- 
ually made and unmade. 
‘We will not dwell further at present on these 
wonders, but will return to our subject of air arti- 
ficially obtained. When, just now, I put oxygen and 
nitrogen into the same bell-glass, did anything re- 
markable take place? No; there was not the least 
rise in temperature, no light, no tumultuous con- 
flict between the two elements,—nothing, in short,
-P-A-G-E-226
218 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
that ordinarily accompanies chemical union. 
Brought together, oxygen and nitrogen did not act 
on each other; hence, they did not combine chem- 
ically in the resulting atmospheric air, but merely 
mixed. Now, I assure you there is an immense dif- 
ference between the chemical combination of two 
gases and their simple mixture. There is an ex- 
tremely powerful liquid, an acid, which eats into 
and dissolves most metals, even the hardest, with 
as much ease as water dissolves sugar; and it is 
appropriately called aqua: fortis (the Latin for 
strong water). Its ehemical name is nitric acid. 
The Latin term is very expressive, for very few 
substances can resist the furious strength of this 
liquid. Our skin, touched in any spot by a drop of 
it, quickly turns yellow, dies, and peels off in shreds. 
That is what results from the chemical combination 
of oxygen and nitrogen. By merely mixing the 
two gases we get atmospheric air, on the uninter- 
rupted supply of which to the lungs depends our 
very life; but the chemical union of these same gases 
produces something that kills. I ask you to note 
especially here the utter difference between two suh- 
stances that are nevertheless both made of the same 
elements. This difference is not unlike that ob- 
served by you between the simple mixture of sul- 
phur and iron filings and the chemical combination 
of these two substances, the combination having 
none of the properties of either sulphur or iron. 
‘Thus, air is a simple mixture of oxygen and ni- 
trogen in the proportion of four liters of the latter 
to one of the former. Oxygen maintains combustion’
-P-A-G-E-227
  AIR AND COMBUSTION 219 
and respiration; or, in simpler language, it makes 
things burn and animals breathe; but nitrogen 
merely moderates the powerful energies of the oxy- 
gen mixed with it in the air around us. What takes 
place in the act of breathing»deserves our serious 
study, but the proper time has not yet come for 
that. Some day, after we have learned certain 
things that will prepare the way, we will take it up. 
again, in detail. At present let us confine our at- 
tention to the subject of combustion, or burning, 
and especially to that seen every day in our own 
fireplaces. A substance burns when it combines 
with oxygen, and so in every act of burning there 
must be both something to burn and oxygen to make 
it burn. Let us look into this a little more closely. 
‘“When we wish to make a fire burn more briskly, 
what do we do? We take the bellows and blow air 
on the fuel,—the wood, coal, or charcoal. At each 
blast from the bellows the fire revives and its 
strength increases. The live coals, at first of a dull 
red, grow bright red and then glowing white. Air 
brings new life to the fire by giving it oxygen. But 
if we wish to_keep the fuel from burning up too 
fast, what do we do? We cover the fire with ashes 
and thus guard it from too free contact with the air. 
Under this covering the coals remain alive for a 
long time, being only very gradually consumed. 
Thus fire is kept up in a fireplace only by continual 
supply of air, the oxygen of which combines with the 
fuel as combustion goes on. 
‘‘Tf a fire is to be brisk and give out good heat, air 
must be supplied in a rapid current proportional to 
 
-P-A-G-E-228
  220 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
the amount of the fuel. In the economical foot- 
warmer, heated by a few live coals, there is but little 
air admitted, and it gets at the coals only through 
a covering of ashes. Combustion is proportionately 
slow, and the heat given out is slight, but it is last- 
ing. On the other hand, in the great blast furnaces 
of our iron-works, consuming their fuel by the eart- 
load, air is supplied in powerful gusts by blowing- 
machines that raise a veritable tornado. This hur- 
ricane of air fans something more than a brazier 
of live coals; it creates a sort of roaring inferno. 
Call to mind our sitting-room stove, when, having 
been first cleaned out and then well filled with fuel, 
it burns with a kind of subdued rumbling.’’ 
‘‘T know what you mean,’’ Emile broke in; ‘‘we 
say then that the stove is snoring.”’ 
‘‘Yes, and it is the cause of this snoring that I 
now wish to explain to you. If the door of the ash- 
pit is open, or at least partly open, the stove snores; 
but if it is closed the stove is quiet. Why is this? 
Evidently because something rushes noisily into the 
stove when an entrance is left for it. What this 
something is will not be hard to find out. Hold 
your hand near the door of the ash-pit and you will 
feel a lively current of air. So it must be air that 
goes with a snoring sound through the bed of burn- 
ing coal. That is what we call a draft. A stove 
that snores has a good draft; that is, plenty of air 
passes through its burning fuel, and so the fire is 
vigorous and gives out a good heat. A silent stove 
has a poor draft; air comes in but slowly, and the 
fire is low. According to the freedom or hindrance 
 
-P-A-G-E-229
  ATR AND, COMBUSTION 221 
with which air is admitted,—that is, according to 
the strength or weakness of the draft,—the fire 
burns rapidly or slowly. 
‘‘Now let us seek the cause of this draft. Overa 
hot stove, wave a piece of burning paper, and you 
will see the burnt particles rise in an eddy, going 
to a greater or less height, sometimes even up to 
the ceiling. Those bits of burnt paper, light though 
they are, do not go up like that of their own accord; 
an upward draft must carry them. This draft is 
produced by the ascending flow of air that has been 
warmed by contact with the stove and thus made 
lighter; it rises and is immediately replaced by cold 
air, which in its turn becomes warm and rises. AI- 
though air is invisible, its ascent can be inferred 
from the rising particles of burnt paper that 
are carried up with it, very much as the imper- 
ceptible movement of nearly quiet water is 
shown by the drifting of objects floating on its 
surface. 
‘“There is another experiment I advise you to 
perform next winter, when the stove is going. 
Take a sheet of paper and cut out a circle as large 
as your hand; then with a pair of scissors cut this 
circle into a spiral ribbon, following a line that 
starts from the edge and gradually approaches the 
center. Attach the middle of this spiral to the 
lower end of a wire hung vertically over the stove, 
and then let go of your paper ribbon. It will 
stretch out, by its own weight, into a sort of cork- 
screw, big at the bottom and small at the top where 
the wire supports it. If the stove is hot you will 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
222 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
see the corkscrew whirl round and round like some 
ingenious piece of mechanism. The cause of the 
whirling is this: The paper ribbon presents its 
surface diagonally to the current of hot air that is 
continually rising, and from the push it thus re- 
ceives all along its length comes the operation of 
the little mechanism. It is this same push of mov- 
ing air against the diagonal sails of a windmill that 
causes them to turn. 
‘Thus it is proved that on being heated, air be- 
comes lighter and consequenty rises, while cold air 
rushes in to take its place. The push of this rising 
air turns our paper corkscrew, and it is this same 
current that carries upward the bits of burnt paper. 
You will now be able to understand what takes 
place in our stoves and fireplaces when we say that 
they are drawing well. If the air were all of the 
same temperature in the chimney, in the room, and 
out of doors, there would be no draft. But as soon 
as the fire is lighted, a change of conditions is 
brought about: the column of air in the stovepipe or 
in the flue of the chimney gets warm, becomes 
lighter, and rises. The hotter the air and the taller 
the column, the faster the ascent. As the hot air 
rises, cold air, which is heavier, rushes toward the 
fire, makes it burn, becomes heated in doing so, and 
passes up in the ascending column. In this way a 
continual current of air is established from the bot- 
tom of the chimney to its top. In passing over and 
through the burning fuel, this constantly renewed 
air-current feeds the fire with its oxygen, and as 
soon as it is heated and has taken on its load of
-P-A-G-E-231
AIR AND COMBUSTION 223 
carbon continues its journey up the chimney, tak- 
ing the smoke along with it and finally escaping 
into the open air. That is how a chimney draws, 
how a stove snores. The draft acts like a pair of 
bellows working of its own accord, renewing the air 
as fast as the oxygen is used up, and so keeping the 
fire going. To maintain a good fire, follow this 
simple rule: allow free entrance of air with its fresh 
supply of oxygen, and free exit of air that has been 
used and no longer has any oxygen, or at any rate 
has not enough of it. Let plenty of air come in be- 
low, let it circulate without hindrance through the 
burning fuel, and then let it pass upward and give 
place to a fresh supply. By so doing you will have 
a fire that, with sufficient fuel, will do you credit.’’
-P-A-G-E-232
CHAPTER XVI 
RUST 
HE boys had just found an old rusty knife- 
blade in the garden. A few weeks earlier 
they would not have paid the slightest attention to 
this useless scrap of iron: it was not worth looking 
at, much less picking up; but since their uncle had 
told them about the combustion of metals they were 
looking at things in a different light, and so this 
scrap of rusty iron was considered worthy of 
examination. There is nothing like knowledge to 
give food for thought. What the ignoramus dis- 
dains to look at, the well-informed person picks up, 
examines, and often finds deserving of serious 
study. So the old knife-blade was picked up by 
Jules, who at once noticed the close resemblance be- 
tween the reddish iron-rust and the fine powder with 
which the burning of iron in oxygen had coated the 
inside of the bottle. He called his brother’s at- 
tention to this resemblance. 
‘*Here is a scrap of iron,’’ they said to each other, 
‘‘that no one ever thought of burning in a bottle 
full of oxygen, and yet it has turned to rust just as 
the watchspring did after being set fire to with a 
bit of tinder. How- did it happen? Let’s go and 
ask Uncle Paul.’”’

In reply to the question, their uncle said to them 
at lesson-time: 
‘‘Most metals, if left to themselves after being 
polished, will gradually become tarnished, taking on 
a sort of coating very different from the original 
luster. If you cut a piece of lead with a knife, the 
section shows bright and shiny; but this brightness 
soon fades, and the cut tarnishes until after a while 
it looks as dull as the rest of the lead. Something 
of an ashy-gray color has overspread the shining 
surface. So with iron or steel: how it shines when 
it comes freshly polished from the manufacturer’s 
hands, and how little of that shine is left after it 
has been for some time exposed to the air! At first 
of a brilliant luster almost rivaling that of silver, 
it gradually becomes covered with reddish spots 
that grow in size every day, until finally they spread 
over the whole surface and eat into the metal. This 
process we call rusting, and sooner or later the 
metal will be completely changed to a red earthy 
substance. That is what happened to the knife- 
blade you found in the garden. 
‘‘Lead also rusts, in its own way. Instead of 
turning into a red earthy substance, it turns into a 
grayish earthy substance. The dull coating that so 
quickly tarnishes the fresh cut in lead is the begin- 
ning of rust. In time this coating would become a 
thick earthy layer. Zinc rusts in like manner: on 
the surface it is of a dull gray; within, of a shiny 
white. Copper keeps its polish no better, becoming 
overlaid after a while with a green coating due to 
the rusting of the metal. So it is that our com-
-P-A-G-E-234
  226 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
monest metals all have a serious defect: they lose 
the brightness so pleasing to the eye and turn into 
a crumbling earthy substance. In a word, they 
rust. 
‘‘Such is the fact. What is the cause? We need 
not look far to find it. You have seen iron burning 
in oxygen and powdering the inside of the bottle 
with a fine reddish dust having all the appearance 
of rust. In fact it is rust, nothing else. When we 
put a few pieces of zinc into an iron spoon, the other 
day, and thrust the spoon into a bed of glowing 
coals, you saw the zine melt, catch fire, and turn in- 
to a white flaky substance. That substance is zinc- 
rust. Lead, if kept melted long enough in a furnace 
supplied with a current of air, changes into a 
yellowish earthy substance, which is lead-rust. A 
sheet of copper held in the fire loses its red color 
and turns black, at the same time giving the flame 
a beautiful green tinge. The black material thus 
formed is copper-rust. In short, these different 
rusts are all burnt metal: they come from the com- 
bination of these various metals with oxygen; in 
other words, they are oxids. 
‘*So far we have been on familiar ground, thanks 
to our experiments in the burning of metals; but 
here we come to something new. These oxids that 
come into being amid such dazzling splendors of 
light and such generation of heat—these rusts that 
have their birth amid gorgeous displays of fire- 
works—are in no wise different from those common 
rusts that slowly tarnish the surface of metals. 
When a piece of iron, buried in the damp earth,
-P-A-G-E-235
RUST 227 
slowly becomes encrusted with reddish matter, and 
when another piece of iron burns with a brilliant 
light in a bottle filled with oxygen, it is the same 
chemical action going on in both instances. When 
one bit of zine takes on a grayish coating and 
another, melted in an iron spoon, burns with a 
beautifully colored flame, leaving white flakes as the 
result of the combustion, the process is essentially 
the same in the two cases. In both, the oxygen of 
the air combines with the metal. Common rust is 
an oxid, a burnt metal, and whenever and wherever 
it forms there is real combustion, whether heat be 
sensibly present or not. A few further examples 
will not be out of place here. 
‘‘Hixposed to the air for a long time, a piece of 
wood is gradually consumed: it turns dark, and 
finally crumbles to a brown dust. This crumbling 
of the wood is really slow combustion, differing only 
in its gradual accomplishment from the combustion 
attended by fire. The rotting wood combines with 
the oxygen of the air as burning wood does in a fire-' 
place, and, like burning wood, it even gives out heat. 
We all know something about the heat that is thus 
produced. The inside of a dung-heap is decidedly 
warm, and a damp haystack may become so heated 
as to take fire. In both cases there is a slow burn- 
‘ng of vegetable matter under the action of the 
oxygen in the air. So, too, with decaying wood: it 
is in slow combustion, and it gives out heat. 
‘‘Why this heat is not felt can be easily explained. 
Suppose a log takes ten years to be consumed by the 
slow process of decay, and that a similar log would 
 
-P-A-G-E-236
228 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY ™ 
burn to ashes in an hour. In both cases heat would 
be generated, but with the rotting wood this heat 
would be given out very slowly, as it must spread 
itself over ten years. Naturally, then, it would be 
too slight to be felt. With the log that is burned in 
the fireplace, however, heat would be rapid and 
abundant, for it would all be crowded into one hour 
of time, and could not fail to make itself felt. It 
is clear therefore that, although at bottom the 
chemical action is always the same, there are many 
different degrees of rapidity with which things may 
burn. An old decaying tree trunk, a heap of steam- 
ing dung, a damp haystack smoldering within, a’ 
stick of wood blazing on the hearth—all these are 
so many examples of slow or rapid combustion; in 
them all, the oxygen of the air combines with solid 
matter that can burn, and the only point of differ- — 
ence lies in the rate of combustion. There is rapid 
and there is slow combustion,—rapid when the sub- 
stance is ablaze and burns with much heat and light, 
slow when it is consumed gradually and without 
any flame or light, and often with no perceptible 
heat. The first kind of combustion is brilliant 
but short; the second makes no show and is much 
longer. 
‘‘Rust, then, is to metals what decay is to a heap of 
vegetable matter: it is the result of slow combus- 
tion. Exposed to the air, especially to damp air, 
metal combines with oxygen, becomes oxidized, as . 
we say; that is, it turns’ into the compound we 
call an oxid. This explains why the old knife-blade 
took on a reddish crust, why freshly cut lead tar- 
 
-P-A-G-E-237
y’ 
Bo ae 
  RUST 229 
nishes almost immediately, why zine, lustrous inside, 
Wears a grayish coating on the outside. That red 
crust is oxid of iron, that dull film on lead is oxid 
of lead, and that grayish coating is oxid of zine. 
A longer or shorter contact with moist air has 
sufficed to burn the metal, at least on the outside. 
‘‘Nearly all metals act thus. Eaten by the oxy- 
gen of the air, they turn to rust, yellow or red for 
iron, green for copper, grayish white for lead and 
zinc. Not all turn with the same readiness. Among 
common metals iron rusts the quickest; then come 
zine and lead; next in order are copper and tin, and 
after them we have silver, which can be kept un- 
tarnished a long time. Gold. is an exception: it 
never rusts, and it is precisely this quality of always 
retaining its luster that makes it so valuable. Gold 
coins and ornaments have come down to us from the 
earliest times as clean and bright as if made only 
yesterday, despite the long centuries they have lain 
in a damp soil that would have reduced other metals 
to nothing but rust.’’

CHAPTER XVII 
AT THE BLACKSMITH’S 
NE day Uncle Paul took his two pupils to 
the village blacksmith, whose smoke-stained 
shop was to serve as laboratory for one of the most 
curious experiments of their course in chemistry. 
He wished to prove to them that water contains a 
highly inflammable substance, a gas easier to burn 
than even phosphorus and other elements they had 
seen catch fire so readily. Ww ater, which puts fire 
out, was now to furnish fuel for fire. Jules and 
Emile did not show themselves very confident of the 
success of what they could not but look upon as a 
rather foolish undertaking. The blacksmith himself 
—farrier for half the week, locksmith on occasion, 
horse-doctor now and then, maker of cutlery if 
necessary, plumber in spare moments, tin-plater 
when old saucepans required his services, silver- 
smith and even jeweler at a pinch (for one must 
make a living, said he, somehow or other)—the 
blacksmith, we say, when told of the affair in hand, 
found nothing in all his varied experience to en- 
courage hope of success in his neighbor’s proposed 
enterprise. Nevertheless he lent a hand in the nec- 
essary preparations with a very good grace, and 
placed his forge, tools, and personal assistance en- 
230 
 
-P-A-G-E-239
AT THE BLACKSMITH’S 231 
tirely at the other’s disposal. The coal-dust that 
begrimed his face partly hid his mischievous smile 
of incredulity. 
A large earthen bow! filled with water was placed 
on the work-bench, together with a tumbler, and a 
heavy iron bar was thrust into the forge to be heated 
red-hot. The blacksmith plied the bellows, and Uncle 
Paul watched the iron bar. When it was hot enough, 
he directed the others how to proceed. 
‘‘Will the tumbler with water,’’ said he to Jules, 
‘Cand then with one hand hold it upside down in the 
bowl, the mouth always immersed. I will plunge 
the red-hot end of the iron bar into the water and 
under the inverted tumbler. Don’t be afraid for 
your fingers; I will take care not to burn them. 
Without raising its mouth out of the water, tilt the 
glass so that the red-hot iron can be slipped under.’’ 
All this being made clear, Uncle Paul quickly 
plunged the end of the bar, heated to the utmost, ~ 
under the mouth of the tumbler. The water boiled 
and bubbled violently for a moment, while globules 
of gas were seen to rise and collect in the inverted 
bottom of the glass. 
‘‘That is not enough,’’ said Uncle Paul. ‘‘Keep 
hold of the tumbler while I do it three times more, 
always the same way, until we have several fingers’ 
depth of gas in the glass.’’ 
Again and again the bar was returned to the 
forge and then plunged, glowing hot, into the water; 
and with each repetition the volume of gas in- 
creased. It went slowly, but still it went, and the 
blacksmith worked the bellows untiringly, being as
-P-A-G-E-240
  232 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
eager as the boys to see the result of this curious 
experiment. What could there be collecting in the 
glass? It seemed to be a sort of air, and of course 
it was invisible. But how did it differ from the air 
outside? In the course of his daily work the smith 
had often put red-hot iron into water, and the hiss- 
ing sound that followed was familiar enough to him; 
but he had never gone any farther. It was only 
those that read books—neighbor Paul, for instance 
—that thought of collecting in a glass bubbles from 
water boiling at the touch of red-hot iron. The 
soot-begrimed face, streaming with sweat that looked 
like drops of ink, had by this time lost its inecred- 
ulous smile, and in its place was an unmistakable ex- 
pression of deep interest. The forge that had 
seemed to the worthy man to hide no secrets from 
him, did, after all, hold mysteries that would no 
doubt soon be explained. 
At last Uncle Paul himself took the glass in one 
hand, tilted it slightly so as to let the gas escape 
little by little, and with the other hand held a lighted 
paper to the bubbles as fast as they appeared on the 
surface of the water. Immediately there was a pop 
from the bursting bubble, and a flame darted up, but 
so pale that one had to turn one’s back to the door 
in order to see it. The dark shop was, in itself, well 
suited to the purpose of making the burning gas 
apparent to the eye. Pop! went the second bubble, 
and pop! pop! pop! repeated the others in quick 
succession, each giving out a feeble flash of light. 
It was a sort of miniature fusillade. 
‘‘Waterproof gunpowder!’’ exclaimed the black-
-P-A-G-E-241
    AT THE BLACKSMITH’S 233 
smith, in astonishment. ‘‘No sooner does it come 
to the surface than it explodes. Once more, please, 
so that I can see it better.’’ 
Uncle Paul again tilted the glass. Pop! pop! 
went the bubbles until the gas was all used up. 
‘And you say,’’ inquired the farrier, ‘‘that this 
air, this gas that catches fire quicker than gun- 
powder, comes from water?’’ 
‘‘It comes from water decomposed by the red-hot 
iron. What else could it come from? In getting 
it I use oniy water and iron, and even the latter 
is not really necessary, as we shall presently see. 
It is, then, the water that gives us the inflammable 
gas.’’ 
‘What a fine thing chemistry is!’’ said the smith, 
with a puzzled shake of the head. ‘‘It makes water 
burn. I ’d like to study chemistry a little if I had 
time.’’ 
‘‘You practise chemistry every day,’’ rejoined 
Uncle Paul, ‘‘and very interesting chemistry, too.’’ 
‘‘Chemistry—I? Is it chemistry when I shoe 
Jacques’s mule or sharpen Simon’s plowshare?”’ 
‘‘Yes, there is chemistry in those things, and you 
are putting chemistry into practice every day, but 
without knowing it.’’ 
‘‘Well, that beats me!’’ 
‘‘T hope to make it all plain to you before long.’’ 
‘“When??’? : 
‘‘Now, this very day.’’ 
‘‘One question more, if you please, my learned 
neighbor. What do you eall this gas that comes 
from water and burns?’’  
-P-A-G-E-242
  234 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
‘It is called hydrogen.”’’ 
‘‘Hydrogen. All right; I’ ll remember that word. 
Some Sunday after vespers I ’d like to show a few 
of my friends what you have just shown me. But 
go on. A poor ignoramus like me ought not to in- 
terrupt by asking questions when you want to be 
teaching your nephews. They are lucky little chaps 
to have you for their teacher. Oh, if I were only 
of their age and you would take me for a pupil! 
But it’s too late, much too late. My old brain 
could n’t make anything of books. Now, what else 
can I and my forge do for you?’’ 
‘‘Start up the fire again, my good friend, and 
make a solid bed of red-hot coals, just as hot as 
you can, with no flame. I am going to decompose 
some more water, this time with live coals instead 
of red-hot iron. We shall get the same inflammable 
gas,—a proof that it is the water that gives it, 
and not the iron or coal used in the process. You, 
Jules, hold the tumbler ready. The experiment will 
be ‘just the same as with the heated iron.’’ 
They waited a few minutes to let the forge get 
as hot as possible; then, taking up a glowing coal 
with the tongs, Uncle Paul plunged it into the water 
and under the mouth of the glass. A bubbling 
followed, the gaseous globules rising in even greater 
number than with the iron. With a few repetitions 
of this procedure the glass was nearly full. The 
collected gas was found to burst into flame at the 
touch of a lighted piece of paper, though the flame, 
as before, was very pale; and at each outburst of 
flame a slight explosion was heard. In short, the 
   
-P-A-G-E-243
AT THE BLACKSMITH’S 235 
live coals served exactly the same purpose as the 
red-hot iron, showing plainly enough that the in- 
flammable gas, the hydrogen, as Uncle Paul had 
called it, came from the water; red-hot iron and live 
coals, things very unlike each other, served merely 
to set it free by decomposing the water, a little at a 
time. 
The blacksmith seemed lost in thought over what 
he had just witnessed. He was reminded of an 
every-day occurrence in his work at the forge. His 
neighbor did not fail to perceive this. 
‘“ell me,’’ said he to the smith; ‘‘when you want 
to heat a piece of iron just as hot as you can get 
it, so as to do a bit of welding, let us say, how do 
you go about it?’’ 
‘‘How do I go about it? Iwas this minute think- 
ing of that connection with your hydrogen there, 
for it seemed to me to explain something that I do 
every day without understanding the reason. Over 
there in the corner is a small trough full of water, 
and in it I keep a sort of little rag mop with a long 
handle. I use it to sprinkle water on the coal in 
the forge, and so I get a heat such as I can’t get 
any other way.’’ | 
‘*You throw a little water, then, on your fire to 
make it hotter; you get it to burn faster by using 
what would seem more likely to put it out.”’ 
‘““That ’s what I do, and I’m always puzzled 
when I stop to think about it. Now, with your 
hydrogen, it might be—’’ 
‘‘One moment, please. We will come back to that 
presently. I see from my nephews’ astonished 
 
-P-A-G-E-244
236 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
looks that wetting coal in order to make it burn 
better rather upsets their ideas. Suppose you show 
them how it ’s done.’’ 
‘‘All right. I’m glad to do anything I can for 
you, to balance what I ’m getting out of this lesson, 
now that I ’m lucky enough to be one of your pupils 
for the day.’’ 
Plying his bellows once more, the blacksmith 
started up the fire, on which he had already heaped 
fresh coal. An iron bar was thrust into the glow- 
ing mass, and after it had been for some time sub- 
jected to the most intense heat possible under 
these conditions, it was withdrawn by the smith. 
‘*See,’’ said he, ‘‘It ’s red-hot, and I could n’t make 
it any hotter by just leaving it there and pumping 
the bellows. It’s as hot as I need it usually. But 
if [ want to get my iron hotter still, so as to weld 
two pieces together on the anvil, I take my sprinkler 
and throw a few drops of water on to the fire; but 
not too much, you understand, for that would put it 
out.’ 
The iron bar was then put back into the forge, 
and the coal was slightly sprinkled with water. 
The boys, like two apprentices, stood one on each 
side of the blacksmith, intent on seeing everything 
that was being done. A trivial operation that they 
must have witnessed many times, but without paying 
it the slightest attention, took on for them an intense 
interest now that their uncle had opened their eyes 
to the properties of hydrogen, the inflammable gas 
contained in water. ‘To acquire an interest in any- 
thing there is nothing like having your attention
-P-A-G-E-245
AT THE BLACKSMITH’S 237 
called to it. Knowledge adds charm to everything 
- around us. 
The effect of the water on the live coals was 
_ immediate. Behold, the tongues of flame, at first 
* full and long, and of greatest brightness at the bot- 
tom, and reddish and smoky at the top, suddenly 
shrank and seemed to withdraw into the midst of the 
burning fuel. Then here and there, through the 
openings in the mass of coal, sprang up short jets 
of flame, giving a clear white light. These little 
tongues of white flame were not unlike the hydrogen 
flames that had been so hard to see in the daylight. 
Their temperature was evidently very high, for the 
glowing mass whence they sprang dazzled the eye. 
Again the bar of iron was withdrawn, this time not 
red-hot but of a blinding white. Snapping and 
crackling, it sent out a splendid shower of sparks. 
‘‘It ’s just as it was when we used oxygen,’’ de- 
elared Emile, drawing back to avoid this outburst 
from the metal fireworks: ‘‘the iron burns.’’ 
‘‘Yes, my little friend,’’ replied the blacksmith, 
‘‘the iron burns, and it burns so well that if I left 
it too long in the forge with the heat as it is now, 
you would see my iron bar get smaller and smaller 
till there wasn’t much left of it. Look round on 
the floor near the anvil, and you ’ll find plenty of 
little bits of burnt iron. We call them splinters; 
the hammer strikes them off from the hot iron.’’ 
‘‘T know what you mean: they are oxid of iron.’’ 
‘*T don’t know that word, but those little splinters 
are iron that has burned. They are plenty enough 
when I make the forge as hot as I can by sprinkling
-P-A-G-E-246
  238 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
on water. But let ’s hear now what your uncle 
has to tell us. How is it, neighbor, that water can 
start up a fire like that? Without water the iron 
( only gets red-hot in the forge; with water it turns 
blinding white. That ’s what I don’t understand.’’ 
‘“You will understand,’’ replied Uncle Paul, 
‘‘when I tell you that hydrogen is the fuel that gives 
the most heat. Neither wood, coal, charcoal, nor 
/ any other fuel makes so hot a fire as hydrogen. It 
is the very best of fuels, having no equal for readi- 
ness to take fire and for intensity of heat produced.”’ 
‘‘Now I understand; at any rate I think I do,”’’ 
rejoined the blacksmith. ‘‘I throw a little water 
on the burning coal in my forge, and the water is 
decomposed, as you call it, just as when I saw you 
plunge a red-hot coal into the water under the glass. 
Hydrogen is produced, and it mixes with the coal 
and burns; and as it is the best of fuels it makes the 
intense heat that turns the iron white-hot so that it 
can be welded. With my sprinkler I give the fire 
fuel that is better than coal. Is that the way of it?’’ 
‘‘Precisely. Water, decomposed by the live coals, 
furnishes the fire with additional fuel, the very best. . 
Did n’t I tell you that you were practising chemistry 
every day, and very scientific chemistry, too?’’ 
‘My word, you ’re right! But I never suspected 
it. How was I to know that by wetting my coal I 
was making hydrogen? One has to read books to 
know those things, neighbor; but I am ignorant 
and have to give my time to my hammer and anvil, 
not to printed words. One thing more, now we are 
about it. I ’ve heard it said by persons of educa- 
 
-P-A-G-E-247
AT THE BLACKSMITH’S 239 
tion that when a fire gets well to going, it’s a bad 
plan to try to put it out with water unless you have 
plenty of it. If you have n’t, it is better to smother 
the fire,—with earth, for example. Does hydrogen 
have anything to do with that?’’ 
‘‘Most assuredly it does. If a little water is 
sprinkled on a hot fire, the water is decomposed, and 
so furnishes hydrogen as additional fuel for the fire, 
which, instead of being put out, burns all the faster, 
just as your forge gives more heat when you throw 
ona little water. But if, instead of moistening your 
coal with a gentle sprinkling, you watered it freely, 
by the bucketful, your fire would be extinguished. 
So fire must be fought with water that does not 
have to be measured out by the cupful; otherwise 
it is like pouring oil on to the flames, as they say.’’ 
‘‘One needn’t talk with you more than five 
minutes to learn something new,’’ declared the 
blacksmith. ‘‘My forge is always at your service, 
as you know. Only too often it stands quite idle, so 
slack is my trade. If your chemistry calls for any 
more of my outfit, help yourself. My tools are yours 
to do what you like with.’’ 
Uncle Paul thanked his friend and took his leave. 
Jules carried away with him, to examine at his 
leisure, a handful of the iron splinters he had picked 
up around the anvil. 
On their return home the boys asked permission 
to perform for themselves the fine experiment they 
had just seen at the blacksmith’s. The inflammable 
gas coming out of water had so astonished them 
that they wished to see it again, and above all to 
 
-P-A-G-E-248
  240 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
try making it themselves, with no help from their 
uncle; and in fact it was one of the simplest opera- 
tions, nor did it require the use of any dangerous 
drugs. The blacksmith, it is true, had shown him- 
self most obliging; but they did not like to make 
too great demands on his time or his good will. 
Besides, there might be some mule waiting at the 
door to be shod, or some tool to be mended might 
be heating in the forge. In busy moments of that 
sort chemistry would only be a bother to the good- 
natured smith. Home was by far the best place 
for it. Without disturbing any one they could per- 
form the hydrogen experiment over and over 
again at their pleasure. But was the thing feasi- 
ble? 
‘‘Quite feasible,’’ their uncle assured them. ‘‘Get 
a brazier and light some charcoal; that will do as 
well as coal, and even better. Have a bowl full of 
water, and a tumbler, and proceed exactly as we did 
at the blacksmith’s. When your coals are red-hot, 
take them up, one after another, with the tongs, and 
plunge them quickly into the water under the mouth 
of the glass. In that way you will obtain inflam- 
mable gas just as well as with the glowing coal 
from the forge. To be sure of the best success, see 
that your live coals are as hot as you can make 
them with the bellows; for the hotter they are, the 
more water they will decompose. Finally, let me 
caution you to look out and not burn your fingers.’’ 
‘Oh, no fear of that,’’ said Jules. ‘‘Emile will 
hold the glass and I “Il manage the coals. I sha’n’t 
 
-P-A-G-E-249
  AT THE BLACKSMITH’S 241 
be such a blunderbuss as to burn my assistant’s 
hand.’’ 
‘‘T warn you that if you try to operate with hot 
iron, your success will be doubtful, as your brazier 
is hardly big enough to heat to redness an iron 
bar of any size. But try it if you wish, and, once 
more, take care not to burn yourselves.’’ 
Having given these directions, Uncle Paul left 
his nephews to their own devices. So well did they 
arrange their charcoal in the brazier, and so good a 
draft did their fire get, that the two young chemists 
soon had a bed of glowing coals at their disposal. 
The operation went off as well as could have been 
desired, the hydrogen bubbling up in fine style. 
Jules, whose sharp eyes nothing escaped, could even 
detect,. when they set the hydrogen on fire, a pale 
bluish tinge in the flame, which had not been ob- 
served in the hydrogen flame when red-hot iron was 
used at the blacksmith’s. Emile, too, when ealled 
upon to notice the difference, did not fail to per- 
ceive it. 
They then undertook the same experiment with 
hot iron. But they had to content themselves with 
something no bigger than a curtain rod, and indeed 
their fire could not have heated to redness a larger 
bar if they had had it. Consequently, they were 
obliged to heat and reheat their slender iron rod 
over and over again, at the expense of much time 
and patience, before they got even a small quantity 
of hydrogen by this method. A few little bubbles 
of hydrogen, which burned with an almost invisible
-P-A-G-E-250
  242 ‘THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
flame, were the total result of exertions that left 
them both in a profuse perspiration, so many times 
did they have to repeat the same operation. But, 
after all, they accomplished enough, for their uncle 
had warned them not to expect any great success. 
 
-P-A-G-E-251
CHAPTER XVIII 
HYDROGEN 
HE use of red-hot iron for obtaining hydro- 
gen from water is a slow and tiresome 
process, requiring many repetitions of the same 
operation to secure even a small quantity of the 
gas. With live coals instead of hot iron, speedier 
results are obtained, but the hydrogen is not pure; 
it is mixed with other gases derived from the coals, 
and to these is due the bluish tinge of the flames, 
a peculiarity detected by Jules. Excellent, for 
practical reasons, as are these two simple and easy 
methods when the sole object is to show that water 
contains an inflammable gas, they must give place 
to others when it is desired to obtain a considerable 
quantity of hydrogen in a short time. 
‘Let us turn now,’’ said Uncle Paul, ‘‘from this 
way of getting hydrogen from water,—I mean by 
the use of live coals. What we really get is a 
mixture of various gases that have to be examined 
separately if we are to avoid confusion. And let 
us turn, too, from the method in which red-hot iron 
is used; though this time the hydrogen is pure, there 
is very little of it. What we are looking for is some 
simple process that will give us all the hydrogen 
we desire, and that without furnace, forge, or

.brazier, which are not always conveniently at hand. 
I have to tell you here that iron can decompose water 
without first being heated if it only has the help 
of a little sulphuric acid. With these two acting 
together, the hydrogen in water can be set free with 
all the ease one could ask for. I must also tell you 
that another common metal, zine, is still better than 
iron for decomposing water,—always, of course, 
with the help of sulphuric acid. We ean, then, use 
whichever of the two metals we chance to have at 
hand, though zine is to be preferred. If that is 
lacking, we will resort to iron filings, which, as they 
consist of minute particles, readily yield to chemical 
action when brought into contact with the other sub- 
stances used in this method. 
‘‘Into this tumbler I put water and some pieces 
of zinc from the old watering-pot that supplied me 
the other day with material for showing you that 
this metal will burn. No results are apparent as 
yet, all remaining quiet in the glass because cold 
zine by itself has no effect on water. But I add a 
little sulphuric acid and stir it in well. Now things 
will go’on unassisted. The water begins to boil 
violently, sending up countless bubbles of gas that 
burst on reaching the surface. These bubbles come 
from the decomposed water; they are hydrogen, 
precisely the same inflammable gas that we obtained 
by using red-hot iron in the blacksmith’s shop. 
Watch now. I hold a piece of lighted paper near ~ 
the surface of the water, and each bubble, as it 
bursts, catches fire with a slight explosion, burn- 
ing with a flame so pale as to be visible only in
-P-A-G-E-253
  HYDROGEN 245 
the dark. As the bubbles follow one another thick 
and fast, there is an almost continuous popping.’ 
This minature artillery popping away on the sur- 
face of the liquid, and these flames dancing on the 
water, certainly offered a curious spectacle. But 
there was something else that appeared to have 
even greater interest for the young spectators: the 
water had started to boil with no fire of any sort to 
heat it, and the glass had become so hot as to make 
one almost afraid to touch it. Uncle Paul antici- 
‘pated the surprised inquiries prompted by these 
remarkable developments. 
‘‘Took into the glass,’’ said he, ‘‘and you will see 
that the hydrogen bubbles first make their appear- 
ance on the zinc, for it is there that chemical action, 
resulting in the decomposition of the water, takes 
place. These bubbles of gas make their way up 
through the liquid and in doing so cause consider- 
able commotion, just as water boiling over a fire 
is agitated by the bubbles of steam that are being 
formed. In reality the water in this glass is not in 
motion as a whole, but is merely stirred by the up- 
rushing bubbles in the same way it would be stirred 
if you blew air into it through a straw. The 
boiling of the water is only apparent, only an agita- 
tion that deceives the eye.’’ 
‘‘But the glass is awfully hot,’’ remarked Emile; 
‘*T can’t bear my hand on it.’’ 
‘‘Very true; but the heat is still far below that of 
boiling water. If you should ask me to prove it, I 
should only have to take the tongs and lift out the 
piece of zinc, whereupon the liquid would immedi-
-P-A-G-E-254
  246 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
ately quiet down, there being no further generation 
of hydrogen, which caused the commotion.’’ 
‘<All the same, there ’s lots of heat there. Where 
does it come from, with no fire to make it?’’ 
‘‘T see Emile finds it hard to get used to the idea 
of heat without fire. Did we need any fire to make 
the mixture of powdered sulphur and iron filings 
raise the temperature of the bottle to a burning 
heat? Does the mason use fire when he pours cold 
water on lime and makes a paste that is too hot for 
the hand to bear? Without fire, without live coals, 
without any apparent cause, great heat is produced 
in both cases, and chemical combination explains it. 
In our tumbler, here, we have an example of it. 
Water is being decomposed, but at the same time 
the opposite process, combination, is going on be- 
tween the acid-and the metal; and this process gen- 
erates heat. We will come back to this interesting 
point later, and you will then see that the heating 
of the liquid in our glass is only what might have 
been expected, for zine is really burning, or under- 
going slow combustion. 
‘*It is not enough to know how to get hydrogen 
with zine and sulphuric acid; you must also provide 
something to receive and hold the gas. A little 
difficulty presents itself at the start. We have to 
do with three substances,—water to furnish the hy- — 
drogen, and sulphuric acid and zine for decomposing 
the water and so releasing the hydrogen.. All the 
water and all the zine to be used in the operation 
may be put into the glass at once, but the sulphuric 
acid should be added little by little as it is needed. ©
-P-A-G-E-255
    - HYDROGEN 24°7 
If poured in copiously and all at once, it would 
raise an unmanageable commotion. Under these 
conditions the operation would be too rapid, and the 
operator would run the risk of being splashed with 
the boiling liquid. Consequently, the sulphuric acid 
should be poured in gradually, a fresh supply being 
added whenever the release of gas slows up. More- 
over, these successive additions of acid should be 
made without opening or in any way disarranging 
the vessel in which the hydrogen is generated. In 
this manner we prevent any admission of air, which 
would mingle with the hydrogen and form a danger- 
ous mixture. 
‘<The vessel commonly used in this operation is a 
sort of bottle with two necks, one in the usual cen- 
tral position, the other at one side. Into this bottle 
is put a handful of zine cut into small pieces, or, 
better, a small sheet of zinc rolled up so as to pass 
through the neck. Enough water is then poured in 
to cover the metal completely. Through one of the 
necks, no matter which, is passed a glass tube, which 
is held in place by a tightly fitting cork stopper with 
a hole in it to receive the tube, and which is bent 
over and downward on the outside like the one we 
used in producing oxygen. Finally, through the 
other neck and into the liquid is passed a straight 
glass tube, which is held in place in the same manner 
as its companion. The apparatus is now ready for 
use, only sulphuric acid having to be added. For 
this purpose the straight tube is equipped at the 
top with a small glass funnel, through which the 
acid required is gradually introduced. As long as
-P-A-G-E-256
  248 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
the release of gas proceeds satisfactorily, no further 
attention is necessary; but if it slackens, a fresh 
dose of acid is pouredin. This arrangement is very 
simple and very ingenious. The straight tube, ex- 
tending into the water as it does, admits no air to 
mingle with the hydrogen, a thing to be carefully 
avoided, as will be shown; but it does allow the 
introduction of sulphuric acid whenever needed. 
Furthermore, the hydrogen that is being released 
cannot get out this way, as the water keeps it back; 
hence its only issue is through the bent tube, the 
(3 e- 
  - nearer end of which is in the second neck of the 
bottle and well above the water. In other words, 
the gas-factory has two doors and only two,—the 
straight tube, which allows entrance but not exit, 
and the bent tube, which offers a way out, but no 
passage inward, when the apparatus is in operation 
and discharging its hydrogen. 
‘‘One thing more. Suppose the bent tube gets 
stopped up in some way, or that it is too small for 
a sufficiently rapid discharge of the gas set free by 
the decomposition of the water; what will happen? 
The gas collected in the bottle, and unable to get
-P-A-G-E-257
  HYDROGEN 249 
out, will press downward on the liquid and drive 
it up through the straight tube until it overflows the 
funnel at the top. This rising of the water in the 
straight tube warns us that something is wrong 
with our apparatus, blocking the issue of the 
gas. But, unless we pour in too much sulphuric 
acid at a time, we need not trouble ourselves to 
watch the straight tube for signs of danger. 
‘‘Such is the hydrogen apparatus used in labora- 
tories, and I regret that I cannot show you one in 
operation to supplement my description; but a two- 
necked bottle is not an easy thing to procure in our 
village.’’ 
‘That ’s so,’’? chimed in Emile. ‘‘I ’ve never seen 
anything of the sort around here. A bottle with 
two mouths, one for pouring in and another for 
pouring out, isn’t a thing you ’d be likely to find 
in any rubbish heap. And so we can’t have our 
hydrogen factory, after all,’’ he concluded in a 
plaintive tone. 
‘‘But should I have aroused your expectations 
at the blacksmith’s if I hadn’t known beforehand 
that I could gratify them? With an old pickle-jar 
and a little ingenuity, need we despair of success? 
Your uncle thinks not. What does our modest bottle 
lack to make it a serviceable piece of apparatus? 
Two mouths; and we will supply them without 
further delay.’’ 
So saying, he took a good-sized cork stopper that 
had belonged to some demijohn, and shaped it care- 
fully with a file to make it fit the large neck of the 
pickle-jar. Then he punched two holes in it, and in 
 
-P-A-G-E-258
  250 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
one of these he fixed the bent glass tube, pushing 
it only just through the cork, while through the 
other hole he passed the straight tube, forcing it 
down much farther. Bits of zinc and enough water 
to cover them well were next put into the jar, after 
which the stopper was inserted, with a little moist 
clay around the edge to prevent any escape of gas. 
Emile was delighted with the turn things were tak- 
ing: he was going to see hydrogen made in as large 
quantities as any one could wish. Everything was 
arranged in accordance with his uncle’s previous des- 
eription. 
‘‘Here is the straight tube,’’ the boy pointed out 
in eager interest, ‘‘that you ’ll pour the acid into 
when the time comes, and there is the bent one for 
letting the hydrogen out. The old pickle-jar is 
going to do very well, now that it has two mouths 
made in the big stopper. But there ’s one thing we 
have n’t got yet,—the little funnel for pouring in 
the acid.”’ 
‘‘T have none,’’ replied his uncle. 
‘“What shall we do, then? The tube is so small 
‘we can’t pour anything into it without a funnel.’’ 
‘‘Let us ask Jules and see whether he would allow 
such a trifle to defeat our purpose.”’ 
‘*You will laugh at my idea,’’ said Jules, on being 
thus turned to for advice, ‘‘but why could n’t we use 
a little piece of paper rolled up into a cone open at 
the point?’’ 
‘‘Your suggestion is unanimously adopted. Lack- 
ing a regular chemist’s funnel, we could hardly do 
better. Your little paper cone shall take the place 
 
-P-A-G-E-259
  HYDROGEN 251 
of the small glass funnel; but it will soon go to 
pieces, I warn you, for sulphuric acid is exceedingly 
destructive. However, that doesn’t matter in this 
case, aS We can renew our paper funnel as often 
as necessary. Economy in this particular is not 
required.’’ 
So said, so done. The paper funnel inserted in 
the upper end of the straight tube made it possible 
without the slightest difficulty to pour in the sul- 
phurie acid, whereupon the water in the jar imme- 
diately began to boil, as it appeared to the eye, 
and hydrogen came out through the bent tube, the 
further end of which went 
down into the water in the 
bowl. The boys hastened to 
touch a lighted paper to the 
gas bubbles thus created. 
Q@uick flashes of flame, a 
erackling sound, a pale 
white light—all these duly = 
followed as the gas came rushing out of the pickle- 
jar and was ignited. It was really and truly hydro- 
gen; a regular laboratory outfit could not have given 
better results. 
‘‘You are pretty well acquainted with this water 
artillery now,’’ said Uncle Paul. ‘‘Let us pass on 
to something else and set fire to a large volume of 
hydrogen. I dissolve a little soap in water, and 
into this soapy water I lower the end of the tube 
through which the gas is discharged. If we took 
a straw and blew through it, we should get plenty 
of foam. The bottle blows in its own peculiar way: 
   
-P-A-G-E-260
  252 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
it sends a jet of gas into the midst of the soap-suds 
and makes a mass of tiny bubbles, all filled with 
hydrogen. In this manner we obtain a certain 
amount of the inflammable gas stored up in little 
thin-walled cells. I apply a piece of lighted paper, 
and the gas catches fire. The explosion is louder, 
the flame larger than before, though the light pro- 
duced is still very pale.’’ 
At the request of the young pupils, who were quite 
fascinated with this exhibition, the experiment was 
repeated and a still greater volume of gas was pro- 
duced, which was then exploded with fine effect. 
‘‘We have nothing more to learn from this play- 
thing,’’ concluded Uncle Paul. ‘‘It has shown us 
how readily hydrogen catches fire: hardly do we 
touch the lighted paper to the bubbles, when the 
imprisoned gas explodes. Let us now proceed to 
another experiment, which will show us that hydro- 
gen, so highly inflammable in itself, can yet be used 
for putting out fire. It burns as nothing else will, 
and yet it stops the burning of anything plunged, 
all afire, into the midst of this gas. It will put out 
a lighted candle as quickly as will nitrogen. Let 
us prove it. I will plunge the end of the bent tube 
of our apparatus into the bowl of water and fill with 
hydrogen either the gage or a tall bottle with a 
wide neck, proceeding exactly as I did with oxygen.”’ 
Accordingly the gage was filled, after which Uncle * 
Paul continued: 
‘‘Here is our gage, now, full of hydrogen. [ lift 
it out of the water.’’ 
With these words he took the gage hg its foot and 
 
-P-A-G-E-261
  HYDROGEN 253 
withdrew it from the bowl, holding it upside down 
as one would to empty it of a liquid. This proced- 
ure seemed to the boys to betray absent-minded- 
ness on their uncle’s part. 
“Tf you hold it that way,’’ they exclaimed, ‘‘the 
gas will all get out. The mouth is pointing down, 
and it is n’t corked.’’ 
‘‘No, my lads, the hydrogen will not get out. It 
is much lighter than air, and so tends to rise and 
not to fall. To keep it from escaping, we must 
block its way above, not below, and this I do by 
holding the gage upside down. There being no 
outlet upward, the gas is held captive. As to the 
open mouth below, we need not give it a thought; 
our hydrogen cannot go down and get out that way. 
I put a lighted candle into the gage and push it up 
almost to the inverted bottom. See what happens. 
The lowest layer of hydrogen, being next to the 
outside air, immediately catches fire with a slight 
explosion, and the flame gradually works its way up 
to the top of the column of gas. But as for the 
candle-flame, it went out at the very first, being 
smothered by the hydrogen as quickly and com- 
pletely as it would have been by nitrogen.’’ 
This seemed very strange to the boys; they won- 
dered how a gas that burns so well itself could put 
out a fire already burning. But the explanation 
soon given by their uncle was found to be simple. 
enough. 
‘‘All burning,’’ said he, ‘‘let us repeat and con- 
tinue to repeat until the mind is quite familiar with 
this first principle—all burning, I say, is nothing 
 
-P-A-G-E-262
  254 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
but the chemical combination of some substance with 
oxygen, which is always present in the air. Where 
there is no oxygen, there nothing will burn. Well, 
then, the candle, on being thrust into the gage of 
hydrogen, went out because it did not find there the 
gas necessary for feeding its flame; it found no 
oxygen, and the other gas was unable to take its 
place, although very inflammable in itself. This 
gas, the hydrogen, took fire, but at first only in the 
bottom layer, because there and only there, next to 
the outlet, was there any air to feed the flame. Then 
this flame worked slowly upward from bottom to 
top, as the consumed hydrogen gave place to the air 
crowding in from below. 
‘‘Hydrogen is about fourteen times as light as 
air. This has been ascertained by means of chem- 
ists’ scales, which are so delicately poised as to 
tip under the weight of a hair. Although an ex- 
tremely light gas, hydrogen still weighs something, 
about one decigram to the liter. No other substance 
even among the most subtle, the gases, weighs so 
little. A liter of water weighs a kilogram, or ten 
thousand times as much as hydrogen. The heaviest 
of known substances is a metal called platinum, * 
which weighs twenty-seven times as much as water, | 
and consequently twenty-seven thousand times as 
much as hydrogen. Between these two extremes 
range all the other substances known to us, some 
being heavy and others light according to their 
1A slight correction is necessary here. Platinum is now known 
to weigh twenty-one and one half times as much as water, and two 
other metals, iridium and osmium, are a very little heavier. These 
three metals are much alike and occur together.—Translator.
-P-A-G-E-263
  HYDROGEN 255 
_ position in this scale. Accepting these statements 
as verified, we will confine ourselves to showing by 
experiment that hydrogen is indeed much lighter 
than air. 
‘¢You have just seen how the gage must be held,— 
that is, with its mouth downward, to keep the hydro- 
genin. On account of its extreme lightness this gas 
escapes upward. Hence we may keep it confined 
by interposing some obstacle to this upward flight. 
Now let us prove that under the opposite conditions 
it will escape. We hold the gage upright, its mouth 
at the top, as if we had to do with nitrogen, oxygen, 
or atmospheric air, all three of about the same 
weight. Nothing standing in its way above, the 
hydrogen will quickly escape, you may be sure.’’ 
Refilled with hydrogen, the gage was set upright 
on the table, and they waited:a few minutes. Noth- 
ing could be seen to go out or to come in. The 
sharpest eye could not have detected the departure 
of one gas and its immediate replacement by an- 
other. 
‘‘We.have waited long enough,’’ announced Uncle 
Paul. ‘‘There cannot be any hydrogen left there 
now. .It is gone, and air has taken its place.’’ 
‘‘How do you know?’’ asked Emile. ‘‘For my 
part, I can’t see that anything has happened.”’ 
‘‘Nor I, either; and if we had only our three pairs 
of eyes to decide the matter, the gage would keep 
its secret and never tell us what has taken place. 
But a lighted candle will tell us what our eyes 
cannot. If it keeps on burning in the gage, it will 
show that the latter contains air; if, on the con- 
 
-P-A-G-E-264
    256 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
trary, it goes out after setting fire to the contents, 
it will mean that hydrogen is present.’’ 
A lighted candle was lowered into the gage and 
continued to burn there the same as before, proving 
that the hydrogen was gone and air, a heavier gas, 
had taken its place. 
‘‘If we lowered an open can of oil into a barrel 
of water,’?’ Uncle Paul went on, ‘‘what would hap- 
pen? The water, being heavier than the oil, would 
force the latter out of the can and take its place, 
while the oil, being lighter than water, would rise 
and float on the surface. That is the way air and 
hydrogen act when the gage is set upright. But I 
have a still better experiment to show you in proof 
that hydrogen is lighter than air. With a few 
straws and a little soap-suds we can give a fine 
demonstration of the lightness of hydrogen. This 
is the way of it. You know better than I what 
will happen if we wet the end of a straw in soapy 
water and then gently blow through the straw. 
Emile used to play at that game not so very long 
ago, and he found it great fun.”’ 
‘*You mean blowing soap-bubbles?’’ Emile was 
quick to rejoin. ‘‘Oh, that ’s fine, Uncle! On the 
end of the straw there comes a bubble, and it swells 
out bigger and bigger, to the size of an apple or 
an orange if you blow it the right way. And you 
can see all the colors of the rainbow on it,—blue 
and green and red, and so on,—more beautiful than 
the finest flowers in our garden. You don’t 
dare move the straw for fear the magnificent bub- 
ble will burst. But before long it does burst,
-P-A-G-E-265
     
      HYDROGEN 257 
anyway, all of a sudden, and you don’t know 
where it’s gone to. How sorry I’ve felt, many 
a time, because my soap-bubbles would n’t fly up 
into the air and soar about with all their splendid 
colors!’’ 
‘¢You won’t have any reason to be sorry this time, 
my child,’’ his uncle assured him, ‘‘for you are 
going to see your bubbles soar upward in fine style, 
and that without any coaxing.’’ 
‘‘My beautiful soap-bubbles?’’ 
‘“Your beautiful soap-bubbles.’’ 
‘Then I shall like them better than ever.’’ 
‘‘Show us first some of the kind you know so 
— well how to make.’’ 
Emile took a straw, thrust one end into the soapy 
water that had been prepared, withdrew it, and 
blew gently into the dry end, making a series of 
bubbles, the largest of about the size of one’s fist. 
All, as the filmy envelop became thinner with con- 
tinued blowing, showed the brilliant hues of the 
rainbow; but they also, as soon as detached from 
the straw, all fell softly to the floor. Not one 
would float aloft in the air. 
‘And why should they rise?’’ asked Uncle Paul. 
‘‘They are filled with air that is no different from 
the air all about them, and consequently receive no 
impulse from this gas either to rise or to fall. But 
their covering, which is made of a thin film of soapy 
water, is heavier than air, and so causes them to fall. 
Hence, if we wish our bubbles to rise, we must fill 
them with a gas lighter than air, a gas that will 
by its lightness not only make up for the weight of
-P-A-G-E-266
  258 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY. 
the envelop, but will also lift it up and bear it sky- 
ward. That gas is hydrogen.”’ | 
‘*But how can I fill my bubbles with that?’’ asked 
Emile. ‘‘I can’t blow hydrogen into them with my 
mouth.”’ 
‘We will make the bottle do the blowing, and it 
will blow as well as any of us. First I take out the 
bent tube and put in a straight one, running side by 
side with that used for pouring in the acid and ex- 
tending upward a little farther. But, as the tube 
is rather neeBe I contrive a smaller outlet at the 
top by inserting a straw wrapped at 
© the lower end in a bit of wet paper. 
It is at the upper end of this straw, 
whence issues a jet of hydrogen—or 
a breath, of hydrogen, if you prefer 
to call it so—that the soap-bubbles 
will form. I place the bottle upright 
so that the little balloons, borne 
: upward by the lightness of the gas, 
will find nothing in their way. Now all we need do 
is to take a wisp of paper or something else and 
from time to time put a drop of the soap-suds on the 
end of the straw, whereupon we shall see bubbles 
form, filled with hydrogen.”’ 
No sooner said than done. At the end of the 
  | straw, which was kept supplied with soapy water, 
there appeared a succession of transparent globes, 
sometimes larger, sometimes smaller, but always in 
an upright position on the tip of the straw and 
straining to get away from it. Many succeeded 
as soon as they were big enough, and then away
-P-A-G-E-267
  HY DROGEN 259 
they soared, rising rapidly and soon reaching the 
ceiling of the room, where they burst on touching 
it. Others burst before they could get clear of 
their moorings. Not for a good deal would the 
boys have missed seeing this ravishing spectacle. 
With wondering gaze they followed each balloon 
every instant, from start to finish. First they 
beheld it as a tiny bubble, then steadily swelling 
and all aglow with brilliant colors. It would sway 
a little on the end of the straw, then tear itself 
away, and off it would go in its flight to the ceiling. 
Oh, how gracefully it rose! But all too soon the 
ceiling was reached and the magnificent sphere shat- 
tered. Another soon followed it, however, and then 
another, and still another, as many as one chose. 
Jules was thoughtful, Emile jubilant. 
‘‘T am going to make this chemical diversion of 
yours still more entertaining,’’ said Uncle Paul. 
‘““Tie a bit of candle to a long stick, light the candle, 
and then hold it up to a bubble while it is in the 
ar? 
Emile was not slow to carry out these instruc- 
tions. Fastening a candle to a reed, he gave chase 
after one of the bubbles as it rose. Flack! went 
the little balloon, there was a sudden burst of flame 
in mid-air, and then nothing more; the whole thing 
had vanished. Emile gave a start; he had not ex- 
pected so sudden a flash or one of so short duration. 
‘‘Does that startle you?’’ asked his unele. 
‘‘Didn’t you know that hydrogen is exceedingly 
inflammable? Touch a lighted candle to a bubble 
filled with this gas, and there can’t fail to be an in-
-P-A-G-E-268
  260 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
stantaneous outburst of flame. That is the whole 
secret of these little aérial fireworks so astonishing 
to you.’’ 3 
‘*Yes, it ’s simple enough, but I was n’t expecting 
ie 
‘“Now that you know what to expect, let us try 
it again.’’ 
The experiment was repeated several times, Emile 
allowing the bubbles to rise half-way to the ceiling 
and then touching them off with the candle. Not 
one of them, however quickly it rose, escaped the 
alert incendiary’s pursuit. Thus it was shown in 
a highly diverting manner how readily hydrogen 
catches fire. Jules, who never asked idle questions, 
finally broke his silence, 
‘‘Our soap-bubbles,’’ said he, ‘‘hit against the 
ceiling and that ’s the end of them. Would they 
go up very high if they had plenty of room? Where 
would they go to?”’ 
‘‘In the open air and with nothing in the way 
they might rise to a great height if they didn’t 
burst too soon; but the least agitation, the slightest 
breath of air, is sufficient to destroy them, so delicate 
and fragile a thing is a soap-bubble. Nevertheless 
if the atmosphere is very calm, the bubbles may 
last long enough to soar out of sight. We can try 
the thing out of doors this minute, for luckily the air 
is perfectly calm just now. Nota leaf is stirring on 
the tree in the garden.”’ 
The apparatus was carried outside and the bubble- 
blowing resumed. Many of the bubbles burst when 
no higher than the roof of the house, while others,
-P-A-G-E-269
HYDROGEN 261 
though very few, rose out of sight. In a short 
time even Emile’s sharp eyes could no longer dis- 
tinguish them against the blue sky. 
‘‘Do they go very high?’’ asked Jules. 
‘‘T think not. A hundred meters, more or less, 
but at that height, being so small and so transparent, 
they become invisible. Their extremely thin and 
delicate covering, too, bursts before long. The one 
you are looking for now up there, hoping to catch 
another glimpse of it, is probably no longer in 
existence.’’ 
‘*But if the covering never broke, how high would 
the bubbles go?”’ 
‘*On that point I ean speak rather more definitely. 
Learned men who wish to explore the upper regions 
of the atmosphere and find out what is going on 
there, make enormous balloons of some strong fabric, 
and then varnish them outside and fill them with hy- 
drogen, just as we are now filling our soap-bubbles. 
With these durable balloons they can go up to any 
height they please. The most daring have gone 
up ten thousand meters.’’ 
‘‘Why not higher?’’ asked Jules. ‘‘I’d have 
gone a good deal higher if I ’d been in their place. 
I should have wanted to see what there is at the 
very top of the blue sky. How beautiful it must be 
up there above the clouds!’’ 
‘*In their place you would have done as they did, 
my dear boy, or probably not so much, for it takes 
almost superhuman courage to dare to visit those 
high regions. When you get to where there is not 
air enough, breathing becomes impossible and you

  262 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
have to come down in a hurry, or you are dead ina 
few minutes. That is why, up to the present time, 
the greatest height attained by man is about ten 
thousand meters.’’ 
‘‘But the hydrogen balloon could go still higher 
if there was no danger for the balloonist?’’ 
‘¢Without a doubt, much higher.”’ 
‘How high?’’ 
**T can’t tell you exactly, but let us say twice as 
high. All that I can be sure of is that balloon-ascent 
has some fixed limit, no matter how light and how 
skilfully constructed the balloon may be. The layer 
of atmosphere is thought to be only about fifteen 
leagues in thickness. Nothing that rises from the 
earth by reason of its superior lightness to air can 
pass that limit, since it no longer has air to buoy 
it up. At about fifteen leagues above the earth’s 
surface, therefore, the ascent of any substance, even 
though it be the lightest gas, ceases.’’ . 
‘‘T ’d be satisfied with ten thousand meters, or 
even much less, if I only had a strong enough cover- 
ing to my balloon not to break at a mere nothing, 
as our soap-bubbles do.’’ 
‘You shall have your strongly covered balloon 
no later than to-morrow.’’ 
‘¢And can I send it up as high as I want to?’’ 
‘*Yes, as high as you want to.’’ 
At this prospect Emile clapped his hands with 
delight, while a gentle smile of satisfaction showed 
that Jules, too, was not indifferent to their uncle’s 
promise. If he could not, himself, explore that | 
beautiful blue void whose mystery so fascinated him,
-P-A-G-E-271
       HYDROGEN 263 
he could at least send a hydrogen balloon up there. 
‘‘One more question,’’ said he, ‘‘before we stop 
blowing soap-bubbles. When they are filled with 
our breath they have all sorts of bright colors, and 
when they are filled with hydrogen they look just 
the same, so it isn’t what ’s in the bubbles that 
makes those beautiful colors?’’ 
‘‘No, my boy; those colors, which are the same 
as you see in the rainbow, do not come from air or 
hydrogen, nor do they come from the soapy water 
that makes the outside of the bubble. They are 
simply the play of light on the extremely thin cov- 
ering/, Whenever any transparent substance, what- 
ever its nature, is in the form of an exceedingly 
thin film, the ight striking on it causes this splendid 
coloring. Put a drop of oil, for instance, on still 
water, and the drop will spread out in the thinnest 
layer imaginable, whereupon the rich colors you 
speak of will appear. A soap-bubble or a thin layer 
of oil or,a film of any transparent substance is 
called iridescent because it shows the colors of the 
rainbow, which the ancients called iris.’’

¢¢w PROMISED,’’ Uncle Paul resumed, ‘‘to show 
you a balloon with so strong a covering that, 
when inflated with hydrogen, it could rise without 
danger of soon breaking. The time has come to 
keep my promise. Emile ought to have among his 
old playthings just what we need for our purpose. 
He doubtless remembers the pretty red balloons 
he used to buy at two sous apiece. To hold one of 
those balloons by its long string was an unfailing 
delight to him.’”? | 
‘Oh, yes, I remember them,’’ Emile was quick 
to rejoin. ‘‘They were more fun than my Noah’s 
ark with all the animals arranged in pairs, or my 
lead soldiers that I used to set up in companies on 
the table. But they are all crumpled up now in my 
old toy-box, and they ’ve been there a long time, 
ever since the day after I got them; for they 
would n’t go up at all after the first day, but fell 
right down to the ground, though they were all right 
for a little while and went up finely.’’ 
‘*And have you never wondered why those little 
red balloons, so ready to go up the first day, were 
so very slow about it the next day?”’ 
‘‘Oh, yes, I’ve often wondered, but I could n’t 
tell why it was so.’’ 
264 
 
-P-A-G-E-273
A DROP OF WATER 265 
‘¢T will tell you the reason. Those balloons were 
filled with hydrogen, the same gas that we used 
yesterday for the soap-bubbles. Their covering is a 
fine membrane of rubber, very elastic, so that it 
stretches freely under the pressure of the hydrogen 
inside. Despite its extreme thinness such a cover- 
ing is, so far as we can see, air-tight, being far 
superior in this respect to even the most closely 
_woven fabric with its countless little open spaces 
between the meshes; and yet so subtle a gas is 
hydrogen that it manages to get through and make its 
escape. Then little by little the balloon collapses; or 
else, remaining full and round, it exchanges its hy- 
drogen for air, the two gases passing through the 
rubber envelop in opposite directions. Conse- 
quently, whether by partial deflation or by exchange 
of hydrogen for air, the balloon loses much of its 
buoyancy before long, and after twenty-four hours 
cannot rise at all. To give it new life, we must again 
fill it with hydrogen.’’ 
‘‘Oh, if I ’d only known that before, you ’d have 
had me teasing you to put new life into my bal- 
loons.”’ 
‘A little chemistry has its advantages, has it not, 
my boy, were it only to put new life into toy balloons 
that are dead? If yours are still in good condition 
—I mean if there are no holes in the rubber— 
nothing is easier than to make them as buoyant as 
ever. Go and get them.’’ 
Emile ran out of the room and was back in a 
trice with two little red balloons, shapeless and 
shriveled, with not a breath of hydrogen in them; 
   
-P-A-G-E-274
266 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
nor had there been for a good while. But the child 
took such care of his things, was so particular 
about putting them away properly, that all his old 
toys were still in excellent condition. The rubber 
membranes that had once been lively little balloons, 
but were now all lax and lifeless, had not the slight- 
est hole in them, as Uncle Paul soon learned by 
blowing into them. 
‘‘Our little balloons are all right,’’ said he, ‘‘and 
now to work! I take a common bottle, the first to 
come to hand, holding about a liter, and into it I 
put some water and a good handful of zine seraps. 
Then through a perforated cork stopper, fitting the 
neck closely, I pass a straight glass tube or, if that 
is lacking, a pipe-stem, or, better still, a goose-quill. 
The free end of this I next insert in the opening of 
the balloon and bind it with a string to make every- 
thing tight and prevent the escape of gas. Now I 
pour sulphuric acid into the bottle, and when the 
bubbling of the mixture is well under way, and the 
hydrogen is being released in ample quantity, I 
squeeze the balloon with my hand to drive out any 
air through the goose-quill, and still squeezing it 
I push the cork firmly into place. That done, I let 
go of the balloon and allow things to take their 
course. The crumpled membrane receives the gas, 
swells up gradually, and is stretched taut by the 
pressure of the hydrogen discharged from the 
bottle. Now you see it all spherical, and threaten- 
ing to burst if I let much more gas goin. Finally, 
with a strong thread, I tie tightly the mouth of the 
balloon a little above the goose-quill to which it is 
   
-P-A-G-E-275
    A DROP OF WATER 267 
attached. In that way the imprisoned hydrogen is 
retained, for a while at least. I then free the bal- 
loon from the goose-quill, so that the hydrogen 
forming in the bottle may escape and not accumu- 
late to the point of blowing out the stopper with 
an awkward splash of the liquid itself.’ 
‘‘Now let ’s see if it will go way up high,’’ pro- 
posed Jules as the balloon swayed this way and that, 
straining to get free, but held back by his uncle’s 
detaining hand. 
‘‘T don’t want to lose it,’? said Emile. ‘‘Let’s 
tie a string to it. Here ’s a long one that will do.”’ 
‘‘Before talking about strings,’’ was his uncle’s 
advice, ‘‘let us consider the matter a little. How 
much gas does our little balloon hold? A liter at 
the most. Consegently, the weight of the hydrogen 
that fills it is about a decigram. The same volume 
of air weighs fourteen times as much, making the 
difference between the two about thirteen decigrams. 
We will say the rubber covering weighs a gram, or 
ten decigrams. Three decigrams, then, are left as 
the measure of our little balloon’s upward tug on 
its string. And with such feeble power at its dis- 
posal you would have our balloon drag the weight 
of along string. Why not a rope ora ship’s cable?”’ 
‘You are right. The balloon isn’t strong enough 
to lift a long string up into the air. Then suppose 
we take a fine thread.’’ 
Attached to the end of a thread of this sort, the 
balloon rose, but, disappointing the children’s ex- 
pectations, it refused to go very high. 
‘‘Tt has stopped going up,’’ said they. ‘‘Why?’’
-P-A-G-E-276
268 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
‘*Because the higher it rises the more thread it 
has to pull up after it, and the weight of this is 
added to that of the balloon itself. So the time 
soon comes when the weight of the rubber covering, 
the hydrogen, and the lifted thread all together 
equal the weight of the air displaced by the hydro- 
gen; and from that moment further ascent becomes 
impossible. As Emile wishes to keep this balloon, 
we will inflate another and let it go without a thread 
to weigh it down. Free from this, it will go up as 
high as you wish.’’ 
And in fact, set free with no thread to shorten its 
flight by increased weight, the little balloon rises 
quickly and is very soon out of sight. How high 
will it go? Who knows? But whatever height it 
attains, sooner or later it will come down, because 
through the fine rubber covering there is taking place 
a constant exchange of gases, hydrogen going out 
and air coming in. Thus becoming always heavier, 
the balloon gradually falls back to the ground. But 
meanwhile who can say whither the winds may have 
wafted it? 
‘‘Tf Emile had n’t kept the red balloons that we 
used to play with, could n’t we have used a pig’s 
bladder instead?’’ asked Jules. ‘‘That would give 
us a balloon all ready made, easy to get, and of a 
good size.’’ 
‘‘T should have tried the pig’s bladder only in 
case I had been unable to get anything better. It 
would have given us a large balloon, it is true, and 
made of a strong membrane; but it is loaded here 
and there with a layer of fat, which would be ob- 
 
-P-A-G-E-277
       A DROP OF WATER 269 
jectionable. You must not forget that the covering 
of our balloon should be as light as possible, so that 
the hydrogen may not lose its power of flight by 
having too great a load to carry. A liter of this 
gas cannot raise much more than a gram. Let us 
say the bladder will hold four liters, making about 
four grams that the contained hydrogen can raise. 
If, then, the bladder exceeds this weight, the balloon 
cannot rise. Consequently, if we propose to send 
up a balloon of this sort, the membrane must first 
be rid of its layer of fat, scraped down, its thickness 
reduced here and there, and all superfluous material 
removed, so as to lessen the weight as much as 
possible, while at the same time care must be taken 
not to make any holes in the membrane. With these 
precautions, which call for the utmost patience and 
skill, suecess is possible. 
‘¢When our village festival is held, one of its fea- 
tures is the ascent of a balloon, filled, not with hydro- 
gen, but with hot air. It goes up amid cheers 
from the crowd and salvos from the village artillery, 
consisting of mortars loaded with charges of powder 
well rammed home. Why should not we, too, in our 
chemical pastime, have a discharge of artillery to 
accompany the ascent of our balloons? A bottle 
shall be the mortar, hydrogen the powder. Every 
time we set fire to hydrogen, even to a tiny bubble of 
it rising to the surface of the water, you heard a 
slight explosion. It is only necessary to find out 
what causes this explosion, and then to produce a 
louder one. It is presumable that air is necessary 
here, or more accurately the oxygen contained in
-P-A-G-E-278
  270 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
air. Let us see, then, how hydrogen and air behave 
when mixed together. 
‘Into this narrow-necked bottle holding about a 
quarter of a liter, I pour enough water to fill it one 
third full, and then turn it upside down in the bowl 
so that it may receive a supply of hydrogen, using 
the bent tube once more and starting the release 
of the gas with sulphuric acid as before. Air fills 
two thirds of the bottle, water the other third. Hy- 
drogen from our apparatus expels this water and 
takes its place. Thus the bottle contains a mixture 
of air and hydrogen, two parts of the former to one 
of the latter. I cork it tightly and wrap it up in 
several folds of a towel, leaving the neck free. Our 
gun is loaded. Now to fire it off.’’ 
With these words Uncle Paul grasped the towel- 
wrapped bottle by its middle with one hand, un- 
corked it, and held its mouth to the flame of a candle 
burning on the table. An explosion followed, and 
it was loud enough to make both the children start. 
‘Hurrah for the little hydrogen pistol!’’ cried 
Emile. ‘‘Famous gunpowder that makes. Once 
more, Uncle, please!’’ 
The bottle-pistol was fired off again charged in 
the same manner as before,—that is to say, filled 
with the invisible powder of mixed hydrogen and 
air. Uncle Paul repeated the process as many times 
as was desired, and the explosions were more or less 
violent according to the proportions of hydrogen 
and air used. Some were full-toned and short, like 
the discharge of a firearm, others were only a noisy 
blowing, and others still, to Emile’s unfailing 
 
-P-A-G-E-279
A DROP OF WATER 271 
amusement, sounded like the yelping of a little dog 
that has had its tail stepped on. 
““My artillery,’’? resumed Uncle Paul, ‘‘shows you 
that hydrogen and air form an explosive mixture 
that will take fire immediately at the touch of a 
flame and will explode violently. This mixture, in- 
visible though it is, has no lack of power, and could 
blow its container to pieces if denied a sufficient 
outlet. That is why I wrap the bottle in a towel to 
arrest the fragments if the rupture should occur; 
and for a like reason it is well in these experiments 
to select a bottle of rather small size, a quarter of 
a liter at most. With a larger one there would be 
serious risk of injury: the gun might burst and 
wound the gunner. 
. **Air, as you know, is a mixture of an active gas, 
oxygen, and an inactive one, nitrogen. In explod- 
ing hydrogen it is clear that nitrogen plays no 
part; or, rather, by its inertia and considerable 
volume it impedes chemical action and muffles the 
detonation. The oxygen alone is active. Let us, 
then, do away with the nitrogen and use pure oxy- 
gen, and the detonation will be much louder. What 
we need for this purpose is all ready here, as I 
took care this morning to prepare a bottle of oxygen 
beforehand. It stands there in the corner, upside 
down, with its mouth in a glass of water. Before 
going farther I must tell you that to get the loudest 
explosion, hydrogen and oxygen should be mixed 
in the proportion of two parts of the former to one 
of the latter. 
‘‘T fill with water a wide-mouthed glass jar to 
 
-P-A-G-E-280
  272 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
serve as receiver for holding our explosive mixture. 
Turning it upside down with its mouth in the water, 
I discharge into it one part of oxygen, using the 
first bottle at hand as a measure. Then I add two 
parts or bottlefuls of hydrogen. That done, our 
gunpowder is ready. Look into the jar. What 
do you see there? Nothing. Nevertheless it holds 
a dangerous explosive which it would be unwise 
to set fire to without proper precautions. The glass 
jar would fly into fragments that might seriously 
disfigure us. But there is nothing really to be 
feared as long as no match is applied. If you ever 
undertake experiments of this sort by yourselves, 
bear in mind that the mere fact of having water 
at hand does not insure you against the serious 
results of carelessness. This explosive does not in 
the least mind getting wet; it could stay next to 
water indefinitely without losing any of its terrible 
explosive power. Dry and wet are all the same 
to it. 
‘‘With the aid of a funnel, I fill with the gaseous 
mixture the bottle we have just been using, corking 
it and wrapping it carefully in a cloth to guard 
against a rupture, a thing more to be feared now 
than in our previous experiment. Now I have only 
to uncork my piece of artillery and hold its mouth 
near the candle-flame. Attention! Say ‘Fire!’ ”’ 
‘‘Hire!’’ cried the boys in unison. 
Bang! went the gun, and the room rang as if a 
rifle had been discharged. Emile gave a jump; in- 
deed, he was almost frightened. 
‘‘To think that something you can’t even see 
 
-P-A-G-E-281
  A DROP OF WATER 273 
should make such a noise!’’ he exclaimed. ‘‘I can 
hardly believe it. If I ’d known beforehand what 
was coming I should have stopped up my ears.”’ 
‘*Ah, indeed! That would look well, would n’t it, 
Emile stopping up his ears so as not to hear the 
chemical pistol go off! No flinching, my boy, or I 
stop firing.’’ 
The candle having been relighted—for it was 
blown out with each burst of ignited gas from the 
bottle—Uncle Paul repeated the experiment. The 
explosion made the window-panes rattle; but this 
time, to make amends for his former show of fear, 
Emile stood as firm as a rock. He even forced 
himself to watch the proceedings with unwavering 
attention, and he saw a tongue of flame almost a 
meter long dart out with furious impetuosity from 
the mouth of the bottle. After a few more repeti- 
tions of this performance he became so hardened 
that he asked the great favor of being allowed to 
hold the gun in his own hand and fire it off as his 
uncle had done. 
“‘T grant your request most willingly,’’ was the 
reply. ‘‘There is nothing further to fear now. The 
‘bottle has been well tested, it has withstood the 
strain put upon it, and it will continue to do so. 
However, as an extra precaution keep it securely 
wrapped in the cloth, so that if by any chance it 
should burst the pieces would still stay in the wrap- 
ping. Grasp it boldly in your hand; there is nothing 
to be afraid of.’’ 
Without flinching, Emile managed the bottle when 
it had been charged by his uncle. With sober face
-P-A-G-E-282
274 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
and standing rigidly erect, like an artilleryman dis- 
charging his cannon, he fired off the glass gun. 
Jules then took his turn, his delicate hand trembling 
a little with excitement. And so they alternated 
until the explosive gas was all used up. These re- 
peated discharges made the rest of the family won- 
der what in the world Uncle Paul and his nephews 
could be up to with their chemicals and their bottles 
and their other pieces of apparatus. 
‘‘Now that our gun is silenced for want of ammu- 
nition,’’ said Uncle Paul, ‘‘let us see what we have 
left from all this burning of hydrogen in oxygen. 
The two gases combine when the explosion takes 
place, and this combination is attended by a streak 
of flame, not very bright, which you saw shoot from 
the bottle. A new substance, a compound of hydro- 
gen and oxygen, is formed as the explosion takes 
place, but it cannot be seen, as it is an invisible 
vapor. ‘This must be condensed if we wish to exam- 
ine it. But instead of igniting a great volume of 
gas all at once, which would be somewhat danger- 
ous and, besides, would not serve the purpose of 
careful study, we will arrange matters so that our 
hydrogen and oxygen shall combine a little at a time; 
- that is, we will light a jet of hydrogen and let it 
- burn in the air so that we can watch it closely. 
‘‘Let us begin with the preparation of our appar- 
atus. It will be the same as we used for blowing 
our soap-bubbles, except that the straight tube hav- 
ing a straw in its upper end will be replaced by an- 
other with a tapering tip. The channel as it is now 
would not do, being too large; it must be made
-P-A-G-E-283
  A DROP OF WATER 275 
smaller until the outlet does not much exceed the 
size of a pin. This is how it is done. A piece of 
glass tubing, as easy to melt as possible, is held in 
the flame of an alcohol lamp and twirled between the 
the fingers so as to be heated equally all around. 
When it seems soft enough it is pulled so that the 
dough-like heated part stretches into a thread and 
two sections are obtained with a mere string of glass 
between them. With one sharp tap in the middle 
of this connection we get two tapering tubes, either 
one of which will serve our purpose. Accordingly, 
we select one and thrust its blunt end into one of 
the two holes in the jar’s stopper. The second hole 
receives, as before, the straight tube for the intro- 
duction of the acid. I will add that a clay pipe-stem 
could be used if necessary instead of the tapering 
glass tube. Of course, if you have a two-necked jar, 
one neck would receive the tapering tube and the 
other the tube for the acid. 
‘‘Water, zinc, and sulphuric acid having been put 
into the jar, hydrogen is released and flows in a jet 
through the tiny outlet of the tapering tube. I pro- 
pose to light this jet, but here we must exercise a 
little prudence. We have just seen that hydrogen 
and air make an explosive mixture. Now, when the 
release of hydrogen began, the jar contained air, 
and hence an explosive mixture is inevitable at the 
start. If we were so careless as to hold a lighted 
match to the gas jet at this stage of operations, the 
dangerous mixture would explode in the jar, 
which might not withstand the shock; it might 
be blown to bits, or at the very least the cork
-P-A-G-E-284
276 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
would pop out and with it would come splashes 
of the acid, staining our clothes with red 
spots and, much worse, perhaps getting into our 
eyes. I warn you to beware of this explosive mix- 
ture and to be constantly on your guard if you are 
preparing hydrogen by yourselves. You must watch 
every moment to see that no air mixes with the gas 
you are intending to light. 
**In the experiment before us the presence of air 
is inevitable at the start. What, then, is to be done? 
The release of gas must be allowed to go on for a 
while. As it comes out of the jar, the hydrogen 
brings air along with it; and, as this is not renewed, 
a time comes when there is none or next to none left. 
But as there is nothing to indicate when this moment 
has arrived, we must simply wait a while, and our 
waiting should be rather too long than too short, 
so as to assure us of safety. Here patience is 
prudence. ’’ 
They waited while the release of hydrogen went 
on and the liberated gas came whistling through the 
tiny outlet of the tube. After a few minutes it was 
thought safe to proceed. _ 
‘“That ought to do,’’ declared Uncle Paul. 
‘‘There can hardly be any more air left in the jar 
by this time. But we may be mistaken, and so, to 
prevent accident, I wrap the jar in a towel to arrest, 
if necessary, any flying fragments or splashes. With 
this final precaution, I hold a lighted paper to the 
hydrogen jet. Instantly the gas takes fire and burns. 
quietly with a very pale yellow flame. All danger 
is past. As there was no explosion when I lighted 
   
-P-A-G-E-285
      A DROP OF WATER 2717 
the gas, there will be none. All the air is driven 
out of the jar, only hydrogen issues from the taper- 
ing tube. Our towel was not needed, but it should 
nevertheless be used whenever we suspect there may 
be an explosive mixture in the jar. Not to hide from 
_ view what is going on there, I now remove the pro- 
tecting cloth, which is of no further use. Instead of 
worrying about an explosion that cannot occur, let us 
examine our hydrogen flame closely. 
‘¢* At the tip of the tapering tube we see a steadily 
burning flame, fed by the gas constantly coming out; 
and this flame is of a very pale yellow and gives 
searcely any light. Such is the ap- 
pearance of burning hydrogen, of 
which until now you have caught only 
fleeting glimpses. It is not a bright 
flame, but an exceedingly hot one. 
ery i. 
The boys held each a finger-tip near 
=" —s the paltry little flame, and each drew 
it back ele The heat was unbearable. 
‘Oh, oh!’’? Emile eried out with pain. ‘‘That 
flame does n’t look like much, but it ’s a good heater, 
all the same.’’ 
‘‘Tt ought to be, coming as it does from burning 
hydrogen, the best of fuels. Do you remember what 
the blacksmith showed us?’’ 
‘‘Do you mean his wetting the coal in his forge 
so as to heat his iron white-hot?”’ 
‘*Yes. Water, decomposed by burning coal, gives 
hydrogen; and this hydrogen burns and thus adds 
considerably to the heat.’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-286
  278 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
‘<Then we could make iron red-hot in this flame, 
though it is so small and pale?’’ 
‘*You could make it not only red-hot, but white- 
hot. Look here. I hold the end of an iron wire in 
the flame, and immediately it becomes dazzling to 
the eye. It is thus that the blacksmith’s iron bar 
is heated in the forge when he wets his coal. 
‘‘Another peculiarity, less important but more 
curious, is that the hydrogen flame sings. Yes, my 
little friends, it sings, and you shall hear its song 
as soon as I have provided it with a suitable musical 
instrument. This instrument is a glass tube about 
as long and as slender as a walking-stick. But the 
tube may be shorter and wider, with corresponding 
changes in the tone, deeper if the tube is wide, on 
a higher note if it is narrow. For want of such an 
instrument a lamp chimney will serve, or a paste- 
board or even paper cylinder. They are made in 
several lengths and calibers. I have prepared a 
number of these tubes, one of which is of glass. I 
begin with that.’ 
Uncle Paul, holding the glass tube upright, lowered 
it so as to enclose the flame, whereupon there was 
heard a musical sound, continuous and full, not un- 
like that of an organ-pipe. According as the tube 
was lowered or raised, causing a greater or less ex- 
tent of flame to be within it, the note was on one 
pitch or another, changing abruptly from octave to 
octave in a manner to jar upon the least sensitive 
ear. Sometimes the note was tremulous, then uni- 
form, and then tremulous again. Occasionally the 
effect was that of a solemn prayer muttered in the
-P-A-G-E-287
    A DROP OF WATER 279 
hushed seclusion of some chapel, after which would 
come a response in high falsetto. In short, what- 
ever the note, it always had a somewhat strident 
tone, affecting the ear as a disagreeable buzzing. By 
repeatedly changing the tube, selecting now a long 
one and now a short, now one of greater caliber and 
now one of less, sometimes one of paper, then of 
glass or metal or pasteboard, Uncle Paul ran through 
the entire gamut in a riot of ear-piercing notes. 
‘‘Oh, what a crazy medley !’’ exclaimed the young 
hearers, overcome with laughter and unable to stand 
the discord any longer. They sought relief by stop- 
ping up their ears. ‘‘Oh, if Bull were only here! 
He barks when any one plays the flute or violin, and 
what fun it would be to hear him join in with this 
hydrogen orchestra! Let ’s go and find him.”’ 
The dog was soon found, and he came readily 
enough, perhaps thinking he was going to get a bone. 
At the first note of the mad music the animal became 
excited and began to howl and moan, voicing his be- 
wildered surprise in the strangest kind of sounds, all 
to the fit accompaniment of the hydrogen refrain. 
Emile and Jules burst out laughing at this instru- 
mental and vocal concert, and even their sedate uncle 
failed to preserve his usual gravity. 
‘‘Put that disorderly pupil out of the class room 
immediately,’’ he commanded, ‘‘or I shall be joining 
in your foolish merriment and the lesson on hydro- 
gen will go unfinished.’’ 
When the dog had been banished and the hilarity 
calmed, Uncle Paul continued: 
‘‘You will of course understand that it was not
-P-A-G-E-288
  280 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
for the sole purpose of treating you to such a chari- 
vari that I took it into my head to enclose the hydro- 
gen flame in a tube; there was back of this mad con- 
cert a serious motive, which I will explain after an- 
swering a question that both of you must surely have 
on your tongue’s end. What makes the hydrogen 
flame sing? Enclosed in the tube, the gas jet meets 
with air, and so there is continually being formed 
an explosive mixture that causes a succession of 
tiny detonations, one immediately after another, 
making the column of air in the tube vibrate. The 
sound we hear is due to this vibration. 
‘*But now let us drop this subject and see what 
is produced when hydrogen is burned. What be- 
comes of the burned hydrogen? I take the glass 
tube again, and wipe it thoroughly inside with a wad 
of blotting-paper on a stick. _So now we have it in 
a perfectly clean condition, without a trace of mois- 
ture on the inside. Again I pass it over the hydro- 
gen flame. But don’t listen now to the singing of 
the gas; watch what is going on in the tube. A fine 
dew soon forms on the inner surface of the glass, in- 
creasing gradually until it trickles down in color- 
less drops. This liquid is the burned hydrogen, the 
compound resulting from the combining of hydrogen 
with the oxygen of the atmosphere. From its ap- 
pearance one would call it water, but before we can 
be sure we must taste it. 
‘‘With the tube I am using it is hardly possible 
to wet the finger-tip in the drops running down the 
inside; so let us make a slight change, substituting 
for the tube a large jar with a wide mouth. I wipe 
 
-P-A-G-E-289
  A DROP OF WATER 281 
the inside carefully and then introduce the hydrogen 
flame. Dew again appears, and drops collect and 
run down. If we wait long enough, some of them 
will reach the mouth and you can wet the tip of a 
finger in them.’’ 
After the flame had burned some time in the jar, 
which was held upside down and, to enable the con- 
densed liquid to gather in one place, a little slanting, 
some drops did in fact collect at one point on the 
mouth of the jar. At their uncle’s bidding the boys 
hastened to wet a finger-tip in the liquid and taste 
it. 
‘Tt hasn’t any taste,’’ declared Jules, ‘‘or any 
smell or color. I should almost say it was water.’’ 
‘*You may say so without the ‘almost,’ for that 
is just what it is. This is the wonderful thing I 
wished to teach you when I made the flame sing. 
Water is burnt hydrogen; it is composed of hydro- 
gen and oxygen. Commonly looked upon as the 
direct opposite of fire, water in reality combines the 
elements essential to the hottest kind of a fire, 
namely, hydrogen, the best of fuels, and oxygen, in 
which metals, even including iron, will burn. The 
two gases are present in unequal parts, one of oxy- 
gen to two of hydrogen. That is why, when I pre- 
pared the mixture that exploded so loudly, I put 
into the bottle two measures of hydrogen and one of 
oxygen. The explosion of this mixture produced 
a little water, which, vaporized by the high temper- 
ature, rushed with much violence and noise out of the 
bottle. From the loudness of the explosion, causing 
the window-panes to rattle at each occurrence, you   
 
-P-A-G-E-290
  282 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
might think a good deal of water had been produced. 
Undeceive yourselves; great as was the noise, the 
quantity of water produced was small, very small, 
perl{ps a single drop. You shall judge for your- 
selves from the figures given by chemistry. It tells 
us that to make one liter of water we must have one 
thousand, eight hundred, and sixty liters of our ex- 
plosive mixture, of which six hundred and twenty are 
oxygen and one thousand, two hundred, and forty, or 
twice that amount, hydrogen. How much water, 
then, would come from our little bottle holding a 
quarter of aliter? Hardly any at all. What a noisy 
celebration over a chemical marriage from which is 
to be born a single drop of water! 
‘‘Now we can see the reason for using sulphuric 
acid with our metal, be it zine or iron, in decompos- 
ing water. We know that an acid unites with metal 
if the latter is first converted into an oxid. A salt 
is formed by this union of acid and oxid. Zine, sul- 
phurie acid, and water are put into a jar together. 
The acid has a natural liking for the metal if the 
metal first becomes an oxid; and the metal, on its 
part, has a liking for the oxygen. The combined 
effect of these two likings is the decomposition of the 
water, which lets its hydrogen escape and gives its 
oxygen to the zinc. Thus the metal burns at the 
expense of the water, which furnishes the element 
without which nothing can burn. It burns, I say, or 
in other words it becomes an oxid, which imme- 
diately eombines with the sulphuric acid to make a 
salt called sulphate of zine. In short, what zine 
undergoes with the help of water is exactly what it
-P-A-G-E-291
  A DROP OF WATER 283 
undergoes in a brazier when it burns with the help 
of air. The metal burns there, or is turned into an 
oxid. It is this burning of the metal that produces 
the heat generated by our hydrogen apparatuswhen 
it is in operation. You were surprised that a liquid 
should get hot without fire. Now the mystery is 
explained. 
‘‘T said the zinc was converted into a salt. This 
salt, this sulphate of zinc, readily dissolves in the 
water used in the experiment and only slightly dimin- 
ished in volume by the decomposition of a very small 
part of it. The metal, then, disappears from sight 
just as sugar in melting disappears. Let us now 
take a look at our hydrogen apparatus. For some 
time it has been producing no gas. The zinc is all 
gone except a few blackish flakes resulting from 
impurities in the metal. It is dissolved in the liquid, 
having first been turned into a salt, and the liquid 
itself remains as colorless as at first. We will let 
the jar stand in a corner, and little by little the dis- 
solved substance will crystallize out, and we shall 
have a white deposit of an unbearably sharp taste. 
This white substance will be sulphate of zine.’’

CHAPTER XX 
A PIECE OF CHALK 
6 O-DAY, my young friends, we shall have no 
thundering artillery, no furious outbursts of 
flame, no ear-splitting concert on pipes of glass and 
pasteboard, no boisterous festival to celebrate the 
birth of a drop of water. But the lesson will be none 
the less important because it is quiet. We are go- 
ing to inquire what becomes of coal, or carbon, when 
it burns. We have seen how brilliantly it burns 
in oxygen, and we shall not soon forget that magni- 
ficent display. In the process of burning, an in- 
visible gas is produced, a gas that we called carbonic 
acid, knowing it to be an acid because, like other 
acids, it reddens, even though but slightly, the blue 
of litmus. This gas, known to us so far only by 
name, merits closer study. First of all I will show 
you how to recognize it, whatever may be its origin. 
‘‘Here is a piece of lime. I sprinkle water on it 
to slake it, as the masons say, and it turns hot and 
steaming and crumbles to powder. I add more 
water, much more, so as to make a thin paste. You 
have not forgotten that lime is slightly soluble in 
water, and it is a:solution of that sort I desire, one 
that is perfectly clear and without a trace of undis- 
solved lime. This I obtain by straining the paste 
through a paper filter placed in the mouth of a 
284. 
 
-P-A-G-E-293
  A PIECE OF CHALK 285 
funnel. You know that when we wish to separate 
fine grains from coarse in a mixture of the two, we 
use a sieve that allows the former to go through 
while it retains the latter. Well, the filter-paper 
is also a kind of sieve, all perforated with invisible 
pores that give egress to matter reduced to exceed- 
ingly fine particles by the act of dissolving, and bar 
the way to what is not dissolved. Druggists and gro- 
cers sell this filter-paper, which is much used in 
straining turbid wine and vinegar, or any other 
liquid that is to be freed of its dregs. It comes in 
rounds, larger or smaller as may be desired. By 
folding it over once we get a semicircle, by folding 
it a second time we get a quarter circle, another 
fold gives an eighth of a circle, and so on until it can 
no longer be easily folded. Then, by partly spread- 
ing out our folded disk, we obtain a sort of erinkled 
funnel, which we place in a chemist’s glass funnel 
as a support, if such a funnel is at hand; otherwise 
a common tin funnel will do. A bottle for holding 
the filtered liquid receives the tube of the funnel. 
‘‘My filter is ready, and through it I strain the 
lime paste. Notice how thick and muddy the liquid 
is above the filter, and how clear and limpid below. 
What has gone through into the bottle looks like 
the very purest of water. Is not this round of paper 
a wonderful sieve in its perfect separation of the dis- 
solved from the undissolved lime? The liquid that 
passes through is something more than water, clear 
though it is to the eye; it contains a little dissolved 
lime, as we find by tasting it. It is called lime-water, 
and we shall use it as a test for carbonic acid. | 
 
-P-A-G-E-294
  286 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
‘‘We must now obtain some of this carbonic-acid 
gas by burning charcoal either in pure oxygen or in 
~ the mixture of oxygen and nitrogen that we call at- 
mospheric air. We will adopt this latter method 
as being both simpler and quicker. Here are two 
bottles of the same size and both full of air. Leaving 
one for the present, I introduce into the other a 
piece of charcoal well on fire, and keep it there until 
it goes out, which it soon does. A little carbonic 
acid has formed. It is there in the bottle, invisible 
and mixed with what is left of the air originally in 
the bottle. The lime-water will betray its presence. 
I pour a spoonful or two into the bottle and shake 
it up, whereupon it loses its clearness and turns 
clouded and white. Is it really the carbonic acid 
that has caused this sudden change? In the bottle 
there is still some air, containing nitrogen and the 
little oxygen not used up by the burning of the char- 
coal. Could not one or the other of these gases have 
caused the milky appearance of the lime-water? We 
must make sure before asserting anything. So I 
pour lime-water into the bottle that has had no char- 
coal burned in it, and I shake it up, but with no re- 
sult: it remains perfectly clear. Hence it must be 
the carbonie acid alone that turns the lime-water 
white, and neither oxygen nor nitrogen has anything 
to do with it. I will add that no gas except carbonic 
acid has this power of giving a whitish appearance 
to lime-water. 
‘*So, then, we have in this liquid a useful means 
for distinguishing carbonic acid from all other gases. 
Suppose, for example, a certain bottle contains a gas 
 
-P-A-G-E-295
A PIECE OF CHALK 287 
that we know nothing about, and we wonder whether 
it may possibly be carbonic acid. Lime-water 
settles the question at once by either turning white 
when shaken up in the bottle or by remaining un- 
affected. Often when there has been some combus- 
tion of carbon without our knowledge, lime-water 
will decide the matter, its testimony being unim- 
peachable even where the presence of carbonic acid 
is held to be impossible. We shall have occasion 
to invoke this testimony in cases of the utmost im- 
portance. Let us therefore bear this truth well in 
mind: carbonic acid turns lime-water white and, 
conversely, whenever lime-water is turned white by 
a gas, this gas is carbonic acid. 
‘‘T pour into a glass the liquid whitened by the 
carbonic acid in the bottle. Hold it up to the light 
and look through it. What do you see? Whirling 
white flakes, fine particles like those in curdled milk. 
We let the liquid stand undisturbed a while, and the 
white particles slowly settle at the bottom, leaving 
the liquid clear once more. I throw away the liquid 
and keep the sediment. There is not much of it, 
hardly a pinch. Whatcanit be? From its appear- 
ance one might say flour, starch, or powdered chalk. 
And chalk it is, surely enough, chalk like that used 
for writing on a blackboard. 
‘‘But don’t for a moment imagine that the sticks 
of chalk used for writing are made in the same way 
as this pinch of white powder. They would cost 
an enormous sum if, in order to make them, char- 
coal had to be burned and then lime-water shaken 
up with the carbonic acid thus obtained. Common 
 
-P-A-G-E-296
    
288 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
chalk occurs ready-made in nature; it only has 
to be separated from its impurities, pressed into a 
solid mass, and cut into sticks. Nevertheless we 
have just obtained real chalk by artificial means. 
And how has this come about? It is this way: the 
water contained lime in solution; carbonic acid came 
and took possession of this lime, combining’ with it 
and forming a salt known as carbonate of lime; and 
thus the white powder you see there is a salt, a com- 
pound of lime and carbonic acid,—in short, an 
ate of lime. 
‘‘In its natural state this substance, though com- 
posed always of carbonic acid and lime, may be of 
very different degrees of fineness, consistency, and 
hardness. If it is rather soft and tends to crumble, 
it is chalk; if hard and coarse, limestone, building- 
stone, ashlar; if still harder and of fine, compact 
structure, it is marble. These various kinds of 
stony substance, so different in name, appearance, 
and use, are at bottom the same thing,—a union 
of lime and burnt carbon. Chemistry, which pays 
no heed to outer appearance, but considers only 
inner structure, gives them all alike the name of 
carbonate of lime. Hence we could if necessary get 
from chalk or marble or any piece of limestone a 
supply of carbonic acid that would not differ in the 
least from that obtained by burning charcoal. 
‘*Now I beg you to note the curious lesson taught 
us by this lime-water. Suppose we wish to study 
the gas produced by burning charcoal. Do we heap 
up fuel in the fireplace and make a roaring fire? By 
no means. We need no mass of glowing charcoal,
-P-A-G-E-297
  A PIECE OF CHALK 289 
no fireplace, no furnace. A‘ few bits of stone will fur- 
nish us the same gas, absolutely the same. Chem- 
istry abounds in similar examples that upset our 
little stock of conventional notions. To the ignorant 
all this seems like magic. Are you seeking the best 
possible fuel? Chemistry tells you to look for it in 
water. Do you wish for some gas such as rises from 
burning coals? Chemistry informs you it is to be 
found in stone. 
‘‘There is carbon in chalk. The blackest of black 
substances enters into the composition of the very 
whitest. To doubt this would be impossible even for 
Emile, who is always demanding proof after proof, 
whenever any statement surprises him by its 
novelty. It was really carbon, in the form of char- 
coal, that I burned in the bottle; a gas called carbonic 
acid was thus produced; and then, but not before, 
the lime-water brought into contact with this car- 
bonic acid showed tiny chalk-flakes whirling about 
in it. There is carbon, I say, in chalk; but it is in | 
the burnt state, and to burn it over again is impos- 
sible unless its present partnership with oxygen is 
first dissolved. Consequently, chalk is incombus- 
tible. But carbon abounds in numerous other sub- 
stances, and in an unburnt condition; therefore it is 
combustible. It cannot be seen with the eye in these 
substances, nor is there anything to make one sus- 
pect its presence. Take, for example, the material 
of which so-called wax candles are made: this is of 
a beautiful white appearance, and yet it contains 
carbon in abundance, as is proved by the black 
smoke rising from the burning wick. But, disre- 
 
-P-A-G-E-298
  290 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
garding this smoke, let us examine the substance it- 
self and find out whether it does really contain car- 
bon. Our course is marked out for us in advance: 
we have only to light the candle and see whether 
there is any carbonic acid formed. If so, it is an 
incontestable proof that there is carbon in the white 
substance of the candle. ‘Let us try it. 
‘‘T renew the air in the bottle by filling it with pure 
water and then emptying it, as I have already shown 
you. Then I lower into the bottle a lighted candle 
fastened to a wire, and I keep it there until it goes 
out. Has any carbonic acid formed? Our lime- 
water will tellus. I pour a little into the bottle and 
shake it up. Ha! Look there: the lime-water has 
taken on a cloudy whiteness, and hence we know the 
burning of the candle has produced carbonic acid, 
proving that the white substance of which the candle 
is made contains carbon. Nothing difficult about 
that. 
‘‘Let us take another example. Paper contains 
carbon, and we have but to burn a piece of it and ex- 
amine the charred fragments, to see, from the black 
color, that it is there. But we will take no account 
of this indication, which, after all, might be decep- 
tive, as all is not carbon that is black. Refilling our 
bottle with pure air, I twist up a good-sized piece 
of paper and burn it inside the bottle, taking care 
not to let the ashes fall, as they would interfere with 
the rest of the operation. That done, I call on the 
lime-water to give its testimony, and again the lime- 
water turns white. So there must be carbonic acid
-P-A-G-E-299
  A PIECE OF CHALK 291 
there, and hence carbon. It speaks for itself, you 
see. 
‘‘Once more: The black smoke of the burning 
paper and the black color of its charred fragments 
make us pretty sure, without the help of lime-water, 
that paper contains carbon, just as the black smoke 
rising from a smoldering candle-wick makes us 
think the candle has carbon in it; and this we infer 
despite the whiteness of both paper and candle. But 
now we come to a third substance that gives no 
similar indication of the presence of carbon. It is 
alcohol, or spirit of wine. Its strong winy odor 
proves at once that it is not water, though it is quite 
as clear. It takes fire readily and burns with a 
smokeless flame. Is there carbon in this inflammable 
and perfectly colorless liquid? Not a sign of any- 
thing black do we detect either in the flame or any- 
where near it. There is no foul smoke, no dark- 
colored residue. Only lime-water can settle the 
question here. Into a small cup supported by a wire 
bent into a ring at one end [ pour a little aleohol. I 
light it and lower it into the bottle, the air in which I 
have first renewed. As soon as the alcohol stops 
burning I apply the lime-water test. The water is 
whitened. That settles it. I can now affirm with 
absolute certainty that alcohol, a liquid as colorless 
and transparent as water, contains that compact 
black, opaque substance called carbon. 
‘“In this way we might test a great variety of sub- 
stances, and all in which the gaseous products of 
combustion produced a clouding of lime-water would
-P-A-G-E-300
292 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
be shown to have carbon in their composition. If I 
have laid some stress on this point, it is to show you 
by experiment the deceitfulness of appearances in 
determining the real nature of a compound sub- 
stance. I have just proved to you, by facts that 
speak for themselves, the presence of carbon in sub- 
stances that, from appearances only, would not be 
suspected of containing it; and thus you are pre- 
pared for the even more surprising demonstration 
that a piece of stone can be made to yield the gas 
we call carbonic acid. 
‘‘Chalk, marble, and all limestones contain car- 
bonie acid, an acid of little strength and always 
ready to give up its place to any other acid that is 
more powerful. In chemistry the harsh law of the 
strongest prevails: get out of that and make room 
for me. If, then, we pour some strong acid on car- 
bonate of lime, carbonic acid is set free, being ousted 
by the new-comer, which takes its place and forms 
with the lime a new salt. Sulphuric acid, for ex- 
ample, turns a carbonate into a sulphate, and phos- 
phoric acid turns it into a phosphate. In both eases 
the carbonic acid is set free, and its release is accom- 
panied by a foaming on the surface of the stone. 
‘“‘The thing is worth seeing. Let us experiment 
with the pinch of white powder obtained when we 
“shook a little lime-water in the bottle in which 
we had burned a piece of charcoal. Here is the 
powder in the bottom of this glass and not yet dry, 
but that will not interfere in the least with the suc- 
cess of our experiment. I let a drop of sulphuric 
acid fall on to the white paste. Immediately 
 
-P-A-G-E-301
  A PIECE OF CHALK 293 
the mixture has the appearance of boiling and is 
covered with froth; it foams, as we say. This foam 
is made of the bubbles of carbonic acid driven out 
by the other acid. Now let us try some real chalk, 
such as is used for writing on blackboards. I take a 
stick of it and with the help of a slender glass rod I 
place a drop of sulphuric acid on the chalk. Where 
the acid touches the chalk there is a foaming appear- 
ance, a sure sign that carbonic acid is being driven 
out. 
‘¢You were already inclined to consider this white 
powder of the same nature as chalk, taking my word 
for it and also judging from the likeness of ap- 
pearance between the two; and now a very decisive 
test proves it beyond a doubt. Both substances 
foam when touched with an acid, and both yield the 
same gas, as could easily be ascertained by operat- 
ing on a larger scale and by collecting the bubbles of 
' gas which cause the foam. The resemblance is not 
confined to mere appearances, but goes deeper and is 
fundamental; that is to say, ‘the two substances 
tested are the same thing. 
‘‘Limestone, again, is the same thing. But how 
are we to know limestone when we see it, how dis- 
tinguish it from other kinds of stone? These are 
questions to be answered without delay, as we are 
about to use this stone in obtaining a sufficient 
supply of carbonic acid for further experiments. 
We must not proceed in any haphazard fashion, try- 
ing the first stone we come to, and then another if 
that does not serve our purpose. We must be able 
at the very start to give our apparatus the right 
 
-P-A-G-E-302
  294 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
material for producing carbonic acid. Where is 
this material, this storehouse of gas, to be found, 
and how can we pick out our particular kind of stone 
from among so many different kinds? A drop of 
strong acid will give the answer. Here is a hard 
stone picked up in the bed of a brook. I touch it 
with a drop of sulphuric acid: no result, no foam; 
hence the stone contains no carbonic acid, is not a 
carbonate, and will be of no use to us in producing 
the gas we desire. We throw it away. Here is a 
second stone, as hard as the first. I test it in the 
same manner, and the acid makes it foam at the 
merest touch. So there is carbonic acid here. The 
stone is carbonate of lime, limestone. For one who 
is not well acquainted with the rocks of his region 
and cannot distinguish one from another by outward 
appearances, there is—as you now see, I hope—a 
very convenient way of settling all doubts as to what 
is limestone and what is not.’’ 
‘‘That is plain enough,’’ Emile agreed; ‘‘if it 
foams with a strong acid, it is limestone; if not, it 
isn’t limestone. The one that foams will give car- 
bonic acid, and the other won’t, for the very good 
reason that it has none.”’ 
‘‘In our definition,’? Uncle Paul continued, ‘‘I 
will change only one word, and I do this in order 
that our terms may be those used in chemistry. 
When I spoke of ‘foaming’ to indicate the bubbling 
or boiling produced when a gas is set free, I should 
more properly have said ‘effervescing.’ In chem- 
ical language, then, we say that limestone effervesces 
under the action of a strong acid, which is really the 
 
-P-A-G-E-303
     
   A PIECE OF CHALK 295 
Same as saying that it bubbles, foams, or froths; and 
a stone that does not effervesce is not limestone. 
‘<The word ‘limestone’ means carbonate of lime; 
but there are many other carbonates, each metal giv- 
ing one of its own, or sometimes more than one, as 
occasionally there are several carbonates for the 
same metal. Iron, copper, lead, zinc, to name no 
others, have each its own carbonate, just as calcium 
has, this last being, of course, carbonate of lime, or 
limestone. This carbonate is much more plentiful 
than any of the others, and plays a more important 
part in this world of ours; therefore I particularly 
eall your attention to it. A good half of the soil is 
made of it. Great mountain-chains are blocks of 
this salt. Whether rare or abundant, all carbonates 
without exception have the peculiarity of effervesc- 
ing when touched with an acid. Since they all con- 
tain carbonic acid, as otherwise they would not be 
carbonates, they all release this acid when a 
stronger acid comes to take its place. Efferves- 
cence or foaming is the invariable accompaniment 
of this release of gas. You will see before long 
what lessons are to be learned from this peculiarity. 
‘*T put into this glass a pinch or two of ashes from 
the fireplace. If I were to ask you what these ashes 
contain, what would your answer be? You could 
not tell me, for neither sight, taste, nor smell gives 
us any information. But by a skilful roundabout 
method we can arrive at the answer, with evidence 
to back it up. I pour a little sulphuric acid on the 
ashes, and very decided effervescence follows, the 
mixture of acid and ashes foaming rather violently.
-P-A-G-E-304
  296 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
Consequently we infer— But who will tell me?’’ 
‘‘T know,’’ Emile hastened to reply; ‘‘there is 
carbonate of lime in the ashes.’’ 
‘*T think,’’ said Jules, ‘‘that Emile has jumped to 
a rather hasty conclusion. All carbonates_ effer- 
_vesce with-aecid, and so the foaming shows only that 
there is a carbonate in the ashes, but does n’t tell us 
which carbonate.’’ 
‘‘You are right, my boy. The ashes contain a 
carbonate, but not that of lime; it is of another 
metal, potassium, a name you have already heard. 
If what I have just done to the ashes does not tell 
us the nature of the metal they contain, it at least 
tells us that in these ashes from our fireplace there 
is carbonic acid. In this connection it is well for 
you to learn that chemists determine the nature of 
a substance by just such tests as this. You hand 
to the chemist a rock, a mineral, an earthy substance, 
or anything else you deem worthy of serious exam- 
ination. He tests the thing with one chemical and 
informs you that it contains iron; he tests it with 
another and says it contains copper; a third test 
proves the presence of sulphur; and so on. Yet 
neither iron, copper, nor sulphur was visible to the 
eye, nor did they become so in the course of the 
various tests. Nevertheless, that they are there is 
proved conclusively by the action of the various 
chemicals. When a piece of white marble effer- 
vesces on being touched with sulphuric acid, I con- 
clude that the marble contains carbonic acid and, 
consequently, carbon. It is in similar manner that 
the chemist reasons from the tests he applies, 
 
-P-A-G-E-305
  A PIECE OF CHALK 297 
ascertaining by these tests that one substance con- 
tains this and another that, without needing to see 
with his eyes either this or that. 
‘‘Now, then, let us get to work with our prepara- 
tion of carbonic acid. For this purpose we have 
here a quantity of broken limestone. I put a good 
handful into a glass, and add water to moderate the 
action of the acid so as to give us a steady and not 
too rapid release of the gas instead of a violent 
effervescence, which would be difficult to manage. 
The acid I am going to use will not be sulphuric acid, 
which I used in the experiments you have just wit- 
nessed; and the reason for not using it is this: with 
sulphuric acid, carbonate of lime would change to 
sulphate of lime, or plaster of Paris, an insoluble 
substance that would encrust the fragments of stone 
and thus obstruct further action on the part of the 
acid, so that the release of gas would come to a 
standstill. The operation, though successful enough 
at first, would come to an untimely end. For an 
uninterrupted release of gas, the pieces of stone 
must keep their surfaces clean, not coated over with 
a protecting layer. In other words, the new com- 
pound formed with the acid must get out of the way 
as fast as it forms. This conditon is fulfilled if 
the new compound dissolves in the surrounding 
water, a result obtained by the use of hydrochloric 
acid.’’ 
‘‘What acid did you say?’’ asked Emile. 
‘‘T said hydrochloric acid.’’ 
‘‘What a funny name! I don’t believe I can 
remember it.’’  
-P-A-G-E-306

‘‘Don’t blame me; I didn’t invent it. We will 
call it, if you like, spirit of salt, the name it bears 
in workshops and factories where it is used. My 
friend the blacksmith, who is also a locksmith and 
a coppersmith, uses it to clean his old copper uten- 
sils, and he gave me this bottleful. Talk to him 
about spirit of salt, and he will know what you 
mean; call it hydrochloric acid, and he will give you 
a blank look.”’ 
| ‘‘But why is it called spirit of salt? That’s a 
~ rather queer name too.’’ 
‘‘It is so called because it is made from salt, 
common kitchen salt. As for the word ‘spirit,’ 
which seems to puzzle you in this connection, it is 
a remnant of the old-time language of early chemis- 
try, which gave this name to all invisible substances, 
substances that we now call gases, in fact. To those 
chemists of long ago the invisible and inflammable 
vapor that rises from hot wine was the spirit of 
wine, and the pungent acid vapor derived from com- 
mon salt treated in a certain way was spirit of salt. 
‘Spirit of wine’ is a term still in common use, 
whereas ‘spirit of salt’ is heard only among artisans 
having occasion to use it. 
‘‘This acid has another noteworthy peculiarity: it 
contains no oxygen, is not a burnt metalloid as are 
sulphuric acid, carbonic acid, phosphoric acid, and 
the other acids we have had more or less occasion to 
speak of. It is made of chlorin and hydrogen, and 
this composition gives it the name you find so hard 
to remember. Chlorin, as I hope you have not for- 
gotten, is the metalloid found in salt and in chlorie

acid. As to hydrogen, it is not necessary to remind 
you what that is, 
‘‘Briefly, hydrochloric acid or spirit of salt, which- 
ever you please, is a yellowish liquid of a very sour 
taste, evaporating in the air in white fumes of an 
exceedingly pungent odor. I pour some into the 
glass containing water and pieces of limestone, 
whereupon there follows a lively boiling and bub- 
bling caused by the release of carbonic acid from 
the stone and its replacement by the acid of salt; and 
this chemical action we shall turn to our account in 
the next lessons’’ eas

CHAPTER XXI 
CARBONIC-ACID GAS 
66 ESTERDAY we found limestone to be rich in 
carbonic acid, and we also found that, to re- 
lease this gas from the stone and obtain it by itself, 
all we need to do is to apply to the stone another 
and a stronger acid, preferably hydrochloric acid, a 
very cheap liquid and one that has the additional 
advantage of always keeping the surface of the 
stone clean. Our plan for to-day is to extract from 
limestone this gas of burnt carbon. The apparatus 
required will be the same as for the preparing of 
hydrogen,—that is to say, a two-necked bottle or 
jar, if our laboratory can furnish this handy utensil; 
or else, if our resources are more modest, a bottle 
with a wide neck to hold a large stopper having two 
holes running through it from top to bottom. Into 
one of these holes will be fitted a straight glass tube 
reaching to the lower part of the bottle, and through 
it, by means of a small glass funnel or, lacking 
that, a paper cone, the hydrochloric acid will be 
poured little by little so that the effervescence may 
not be rapid enough to make the foam rise too high 
and run over. Through the second opening will 
pass a bent tube to serve as conductor of the re- 
leased gas. 
300 
 
-P-A-G-E-309
      
      CARBONIC-ACID GAS 301 
‘‘Here is what we are after,—a plain bottle with 
a large cork stopper having two holes through it. 
Into this bottle I put a handful of broken limestone 
of the hardest sort. If I had a piece of marble,— 
a fragment from some old bureau-top, for example, 
—things would go better; but, not having any, I do 
the best I can with common limestone, its only defect 
being a tendency to soil the liquid somewhat with its 
impurities. I add water and adjust the stopper 
with its two tubes. Of course the straight tube, not 
the bent one, is pushed down into the liquid. Now 
I pour in a little hydrochloric acid, and immediately 
we see a commotion, a kind of boiling, caused by the 
setting free of gas from the stone. From this point 
things will go of themselves, and we need only let 
the apparatus alone, confining our activities to the 
occasional addition of a little acid to keep the proc- 
ess from halting.’’ 
‘Quick, quick, the bowl of water for collecting the 
gas!’’ cried Emile, seeing his uncle abandon the 
apparatus to itself in an apparently very careless 
fashion. 
‘‘The bowl of water is unnecessary here,’’ his 
uncle assured him; ‘‘we shall get our carbonic-acid 
gas quite well without having to use that cumbrous 
thing.”’ 
‘‘But the gas is just going to waste.’’ 
‘‘We can afford to waste a little, so easy is it to 
make more and so inexpensive the process. What 
does it take to produce all we wish of this gas? 
Only a pennyworth of acid and a stone picked up 
by the roadside. Besides, there is a reason for
-P-A-G-E-310
  302 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
my inattention to waste: there is air in the bottle, 
and I am allowing the carbonic acid to drive it out. 
‘<Now it is done, or very nearly, and there is no 
more air left in the apparatus—except, perhaps, a 
mere trace. Accordingly, I introduce into a wide- 
mouthed bottle the tube conducting the gas, and 
  make sure that it reaches to the bottom. In a few 
moments the bottle will be full of carbonic acid.’’ 
‘*But it will get out of the bottle, for there ’s no 
cork,’’ objected Jules; ‘‘or at least it will mix with 
the air in the bottle.’’ 
‘You need fear nothing of the sort,’’ replied his 
uncle. ‘‘Carbonic acid is heavier-than-air. As fast 
as it arrives, conducted by the tube that reaches 
almost to the bottom of the receiving bottle, it ac- 
cumulates and forms an increasingly thick layer, 
which expels the air, a lighter gas. This air comes 
out in an invisible stream through the mouth of the 
bottle, while the carbonic-acid gas takes its place, 
little by little, from the bottom to the top of the 
bottle. If we had a vessel full of oil and slowly 
poured in a stream of water at the bottom, what 
would happen? The water, being heavier than the
-P-A-G-E-311
CARBONIC-ACID GAS 303 
oil, would accumulate in the bottom of the vessel, 
rise gradually, and drive out the oil, the lighter 
liquid. A similar process goes on when carbonic- 
acid gas is introduced at the bottom of an enclosed 
body of air.’’ 
‘‘T understand,’’ said Emile, ‘‘but I should like 
to ask one question. With oil, I should know by the 
color when it was all driven out and its place taken 
by water; but here there ’s nothing to be seen, 
neither carbonic-acid gas nor air. How can we 
know, then, when all the air is driven out and the 
bottle filled with carbonic acid?’’ 
‘‘What our eyes cannot tell us, a flame will help 
us to see with our understanding. €arbonic-acid 
is a foe to combustion; it will not keep the smallest 
flame alive.) I will light a piece of paper and thrust 
it into the mouth of the bottle. If it continues to 
burn, there is still a layer of air in the upper part 
of the bottle; but if it goes out, there is nothing 
in the bottle but carbonic-acid gas. Let us try it; 
now is the time. Hardly is the lighted paper inside 
the neck of the bottle when it is extinguished,—a 
sure proof that carbonic-acid gas reaches up to the 
mouth of the bottle. We have now a supply of 
this gas for future experiment. I put the appara- 
tus aside, as we have no further use for it at present. 
When we need it again, all we shall have to do 
will be to pour in more hydrochloric acid and let it 
act on the limestone. 
“Here, then, is our carbonic-acid gas. It is as 
colorless, as transparent, as invisible as air. We 
have just extracted it from limestone, where chemi- 
     
-P-A-G-E-312
   304 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
  cal combination held great quantities of it captive 
within a very narrow compass. <A piece of stone 
hardly bigger than a walnut will yield several 
liters of it. We have just driven some of it out of 
rock, and we are now going to drive it back and 
make it reénter the composition of rock,—that is to 
say limestone, powdered chalk. I pour some lime- 
water into the bottle that is filled with carbonic- 
acid gas, close it tightly with the palm of my hand, 
and shake it thoroughly. The liquid turns white 
and thick like sour milk. We let it stand a while, 
and flakes settle at the bottom in a considerable 
layer. You know these white flakes as carbonate 
of lime, chalk, the compound we obtained when we 
shook up lime-water and carbonic acid obtained by 
burning charcoal. So here we have fresh proof, to 
add to the others, that limestone really contains the 
gas produced by burning charcoal. 
‘“‘The gas has disappeared, being shut up once 
more in the stone,—or, rather, in a sort of mud 
that would become stone if it were dried and 
pressed. Again I bring out our apparatus and re- 
new the supply of carbonic-acid gas in the bottle. 
How do you suppose a lighted candle would behave 
in such an atmosphere?’’ 
“‘Tt would go out,’’ was Emile’s reply, ‘‘just as 
the lighted paper did.’’ 
‘*Besides,’’ added Jules, ‘‘nothing can burn ex- 
cept in oxygen or in the air.”’ 
The candle did indeed go out, the very instant 
the flame got as far as the neck of the bottle. The 
results attained with nitrogen had not been quicker 
    
-P-A-G-E-313
    CARBONIC-ACID GAS 305 
or more complete. Not only was the candle imme- 
diately extinguished, but there was not the slightest 
glow left-for an instant in the wick. 
‘Without making any cruel experiments,’’ Uncle 
Paul went on, ‘‘we can feel sure that this gas, so 
manifestly unfit for combustion, is equally unfit for 
maintaining life. An animal would die in it, and 
very quickly, just as you saw the sparrow die in 
an atmosphere of nitrogen. Let us now proceed 
to prove that carbonic-acid gas is heavier than air. 
I have turned this comparative heaviness to account 
in collecting the gas without the help of our bowl 
of water, so that the proof is in reality already 
before us. Nevertheless I will give you a still more 
striking demonstration. 
‘‘We will take two bottles holding equal amounts 
and having mouths of equal size. This one, at my 
right, is full of ecarbonic-acid gas. I lower a lighted 
candle into it, and the candle is immediately ex- 
tinguished. This other bottle, at my left, is full 
of atmospheric air. I lower a lighted candle into 
it, and the flame continues to burn. Now, removing 
the candle, I take the right-hand bottle and gradu- 
ally invert it, at the same time fitting its mouth to 
that of the other bottle. In fact, I do exactly as I 
should do if I were pouring water from the one 
into the other. I decant the carbonic-acid gas as if 
it were a liquid. Nothing is seen to pass from the 
upper to the lower bottle, nor is anything seen to 
rise from the lower to the upper; and yet the ex- 
change is made, as we shall soon prove. The ear- 
bonic acid, the heavier gas, descends and fills the
-P-A-G-E-314
  306 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
lower bottle, while the atmospheric air, thé lighter 
gas, rises and fills the upper bottle. After waiting 
a few minutes for the exchange to become complete, 
I put the two bottles back in their places and again 
try the lighted candle. It burns in the right-hand 
bottle; hence this one no longer holds earbonie acid, 
but air. It goes out in the left-hand bottle, proof 
that the latter has exchanged its original contents 
of atmospheric air for the gas that will not main- 
tain combustion. Thus it is made clear that the 
bottled carbonic acid has gone down and the bottled 
air has gone up, the two changing places without 
getting mixed in the process. 
‘*Now listen to this. In various places there is a 
constant escape of carbonic-acid gas from the 
ground, especially in the neighborhood of volcanoes. 
There are springs of carbonic-acid gas as well as 
springs of water. The most celebrated spring of 
this sort is that at Pozzuoli, near Naples. It is 
known as the Dog’s Grotto, from the distressing 
part a dog is made to play for the amusement of the 
curious. The grotto is hollowed out of the solid 
rock, and the air in this cavity is earthy, damp, and 
warm. Bubbles of gas rise here and there in the 
mud. 
‘“The keeper of this grotto—for there is a keeper 
who, for money, shows people the repulsive spec- 
tacle I am going to tell you about—takes his dog, 
ties the animal’s legs together to prevent its run- 
ning away, and lays it on the ground in the middle 
of the grotto, where he himself remains. There is 
nothing to arouse the slightest suspicion of danger, 
 
-P-A-G-E-315
  CARBONIC-ACID GAS 307 
no foul odor, no lack of clearness in the atmosphere. 
Besides, is not the dog’s master there, showing no 
sign of fear, standing in the very middle of the cave? 
Nevertheless there is the dog giving tokens of dis- 
tress by its groans; it writhes in frightful convul- 
sions, its eyes become dim, its head falls heavily, 
and it appears to be at death’s door. But at this 
point its master carries it out of the grotto, unties 
its legs, and lets it breathe the pure air. Little by 
little the animal revives; it struggles to its feet; 
still giddy, it looks about in a dull, stupid manner, 
and then runs off as fast as its legs will carry it, 
evidently fearing a second ordeal. 
‘*Does the dog act a part taught it by its master? 
Has it been trained to play dead in the grotto, where 
its master stands upright beside it without suffering 
the least inconvenience? No, the dog really comes 
near dying, as it knows well enough from passing its 
wretched life in repeating the act several times a day. 
It knows it so well that it submits to the experiment 
with a very bad grace. The minute it sees a stranger 
approaching in the distance it turns morose and 
surly, growls and threatens to bite. Its master has 
to hold it in leash when taking it to the grotto, 
dragging the animal along while the poor beast 
shows its reluctance by the drooping of its ears 
and tail. But when the ordeal is over and the 
stranger gone, it is full of a foolish joy that shows 
itself in unmistakable fashion. - The wretched ani- 
mal is completely happy at being allowed to come 
to life again. 
‘‘There is nothing about the famous grotto that
-P-A-G-E-316
308 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
cannot be easily explained. Carbonic-acid gas, as 
I said, comes up out of the ground. This gas is 
not fit for breathing; after a few breaths an animal 
dies. Furthermore, it is heavier than air; and so, 
instead of dispersing evenly throughout the grotto, 
it remains close to the ground, where it forms a 
layer about half a meter thick. It reaches only to 
the knees of the man as he stands in the middle of 
the grotto, whereas the dog, stretched on the ground, 
is entirely immersed in it. The master is not com- 
pelled to breathe the harmful gas, and so feels no 
inconvenience from it; the dog breathes nothing 
else, and in consequence almost dies. But were the 
dog’s master to lie on the ground as does the dog 
itself, he would share the poor animal’s fate. 
‘‘The heavier gas is constantly added to and as 
constantly escapes through the mouth of the grotto, 
running out in a sort of stream when the air is calm. 
No one sees this stream, and one passes through it 
without suspecting it to be there. It makes no 
murmurous sound and flows over no bed of pebbles, 
but runs gently and quietly over the grass. Its 
presence may, however, be detected with the help 
of a lighted candle: beyond the limits of this invisi- 
ble stream of gas the candle burns, but as soon as its 
flame is immersed in the current it goes out as if it 
were plunged into water. In this way the stream 
of gas can be traced for some distance from the 
grotto, while beyond that it is dissipated by air- 
currents. ’’ 
“Tf it weren’t so far away,’’ said Jules, when 
his uncle had finished his story, ‘‘I should like to 
 
-P-A-G-E-317
  CARBONIC-ACID GAS 309 
oo and see that wonderful grotto; but I should n’t 
ask to have the dog suffer that terrible torture. I 
should be satisfied with a test made with a lighted 
candle, first high up in the grotto and then down 
near the ground, to see whether it would go out 
when it was lowered.’’ 
“Tf such a test is all you wish for,’’ replied his 
uncle, ‘‘a trip to Pozzuoli is quite unnecessary, for 
we can reproduce right here the essential conditions 
found in the Dog’s Grotto. A glass jar shall be 
our grotto, and we will substitute for the carbonic 
acid rising from the ground the gas our apparatus 
yields when supplied with limestone and hydro- 
chloric acid. Here is just the jar we need, large 
enough and with a wide mouth. I insert the long 
arm of our bent tube and let it reach to the bottom 
of the jar. Carbonic-acid gas flows through the 
tube, accumulates at the bottom of the jar, and is 
retained there by its weight, forming a layer of in- 
creasing depth and displacing an equal volume of 
air. Nothing tells us how deep this layer is at any 
moment, for the two gases, carbonic acid and air, 
are both invisible. Nevertheless, from the activity 
of the effervescence in our apparatus we may give a 
shrewd guess as to when the jar is about half full 
of carbonic-acid gas. Then I stop the flow of gas 
by disconnecting the jar from the apparatus. 
‘‘Tf I am not much mistaken, now is the time to 
make this disconnection. Having done this, we now 
see before us an artificial Dog’s Grotto,—that is to 
say, a glass jar filled with carbonic-acid gas below 
and atmospheric air above. Look through it. It 
 
-P-A-G-E-318
    310 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
appears to be all alike, the lower layer of carbonic- 
acid gas being as colorless, as invisible, as the 
upper layer of air. Our eyes cannot tell us just 
where the fatal layer ends and the breathable one 
begins. Though there is a sharp division between 
the two, no indication of it is to be detected by the 
eye. 
‘*Slowly I lower a lighted candle into the jar to 
test its contents. At first it burns very well, and 
on being lowered farther and farther it still burns; 
but at last I reach a point where it begins to turn 
dim. This is the dividing line between the two 
layers, and if I lower the candle only a little more 
it immediately goes out, being fully immersed in 
the carbonic-acid gas. Here, then, we have what 
Jules was wishing to see,—a reproduction of the 
Dog’s Grotto and the behavior of a lighted candle 
there. According to the candle’s position, high or 
low, it burns or goes out. 
‘“Now imagine we have in the jar two very differ- 
ent-sized animals, the smaller one completely im- 
mersed in the bottom layer, and the larger one with 
its head in the top layer. The former will perish 
in a short time, as it breathes a gas incapable of 
maintaining life, whereas the latter will suffer no 
discomfort whatever, having a plenty of pure air to 
breathe. That is the relative position of the dog 
and the man in the grotto with its lower layer of 
carbonic acid gas and its upper one of pure air.”’

  CHAPTER XXII 
DIFFERENT KINDS OF WATER 
*¢ WT would be a grave error, my young friends, to 
regard chemistry as nothing but a succession 
of experiments for amusing us in our leisure hours. 
There is, I admit, hardly anything that is more en- 
tertaining than to see a ribbon of iron burning 
brightly in oxygen, or to send up a little balloon 
inflated with hydrogen and then make it explode 
with a bang at the touch of fire. If such tricks as 
these keep the mind wide awake, so much the better, 
and what we learn through. them will be all the more 
deeply impressed on the memory; but beware of 
imagining that chemistry ends there. The pursuit 
of this science is no such paltry affair; it is a very 
serious business, and has to do with all that con- 
cerns us in the material universe. To-day it is to 
show us why wine, cider, beer, and other fermented 
drinks foam. 
‘“‘There are effervescent wines,—that isto say, 
wines that make the cork pop out of the bottle and 
are covered with foam when poured into a glass. 
To obtain such wines, we bottle them before fermen- 
tation is finished. Carbonic-acid gas thus continues 
to form in them; and as its outlet is closed by the 
cork stopper, it is forced to remain in the liquid, 
where it accumulates, but never desists from its 
311
-P-A-G-E-320
  312 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
attempt to escape. It is this gas that makes the 
cork pop out with a sharp report when the wire or 
string holding it securely in place is cut; and this 
it is, too, that sends the wine foaming out of the 
mouth of the uncorked bottle and makes the froth 
on the surface of the liquid in the glass, where it 
causes a slight crackling sound from the continuous 
bursting of little gas-bubbles. It is this same ecar- 
bonic-acid gas, again, that gives its foam to cider, 
which, as you know, is simply fermented apple- 
juice ; and to it is due the froth on beer, a drink made 
from barley in a sprouting condition.”’ 
‘‘Sparkling white wine and cider,’’ observed 
Jules, ‘‘have a sort of sharp taste, but it isn’t dis- 
agreeable. I don’t know anything about beer, for 
I have never tasted it. Does that sharp flavor come 
from earbonic-acid gas?’’ 
‘Yes. Carbonic acid is a very mild acid, it is 
true, but still it has the flavor peculiar to all acids, 
though in a very moderate degree.’’ 
‘“Then we swallow some of this gas when we 
drink wine or cider or beer, though it is a gas that 
ean kill people if they take a few breaths of it.’ 
‘‘Carbonic acid is dangerous only when taken into 
the lungs in some quantity. To our fermented 
drinks it imparts a slightly acid flavor, not dis- 
agreeable, and even wholesome, for it aids diges- 
tion. You are to understand that such a substance, 
though capable of killing when breathed, can be 
quite harmless to the stomach. No one would ven- 
ture to hold mouth and nostrils under water for any 
 
-P-A-G-E-321
    DIFFERENT KINDS OF WATER 313 
length of time; the result would be death from 
suffocation or, as we say, drowning. Water is unfit 
for breathing, it cannot supply the place of air in 
our lungs; but, for all that, it is the very best of 
drinks. Carbonic-acid gas is somewhat like that: 
it can be drunk without danger, and even to advan- 
tage when mixed with a beverage, such as wine or 
cider; but whoever should undertake to breathe it 
freely would very soon die. 
‘‘There is carbonic-acid gas, supplied by nature, 
in nearly all the water we drink; and it is partly to 
this gas and its chemical action that we owe the 
stony material that we take into our stomachs with 
the water, and whose office it is to contribute to the 
growth and maintenance of our bones. However 
clear it may look, the water we habitually drink is 
hardly ever pure: it contains foreign substances in. 
solution, as is proved by the thin coating of stony 
matter that gradually accumulates on the inside of 
carafes and dims the transparency of the glass. 
This coating is very hard to remove, as it seems to 
become one with the vessel to which it adheres. 
Sometimes it is necessary to use strong vinegar 
to take it off and restore to the carafe its former 
transparency. This coating is so resistant because 
it is of stone, real stone, similar in kind to that used 
by masons for building; in short, it is limestone. 
Thus the clearest water, water that shows no im- 
purities whatever, nevertheless may contain stone 
in solution, just as sweetened water contains sugar, 
though it cannot be seen.’’
-P-A-G-E-322
  314 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
/ “Then,’’ said Emile, ‘‘when we drink a glass of 
water we drink with it a tiny bit of building-stone. 
I should never have suspected it.?’ 
“It is very fortunate, my young friend, that we 
do thus drink a little building-stone, as you express 
it. Our bodies, in order to grow big and strong, 
need a good supply of stony matter for making 
bones, which are to us what its timber frame-work is 
to a building. This material that is so necessary 
to us is not made by us, but we get it from our food 
and drink. Water does its part in giving us lime- 
stone. If it did not contain this substance in solu- 
tion, our bones, which are made chiefly of this ma- 
terial, could not develop properly and we should be 
puny and weak. 
‘*A simple experiment will show us how limestone 
dissolves in water. Here in this small bottle is a 
little clear lime-water. Into it, down to the very 
bottom of the bottle, I thrust the escape tube of our 
earbonic-acid-gas apparatus. As fast as the gas 
passes through the tube into the liquid the latter be- 
comes clouded and whitish. We know the reason: 
the carbonic-acid gas combines with the lime in the 
water to form carbonate of lime,—limestone, chalk. 
So far there is nothing new; but let the gas go on 
discharging itself into the lime-water, and, when it 
finds no more lime to combine with, it will become 
absorbed in the water, if not wholly at least in part. 
Then we shall see the liquid lose its milky cloudi- 
ness, gradually turn clear, and finally become as 
transparent as it was in the beginning. 
‘‘Now it is done, the cloudiness has gone, the 
 
-P-A-G-E-323
  DIFFERENT KINDS OF WATER 315 
white flakes have disappeared. The chalk is no 
longer to be seen, and the water has turned clear 
again. Yet we are none the less certain that in this 
liquid, in which there is nothing to be seen, there 
is still the carbonate of lime formed a few minutes 
ago; but it is in solution and therefore invisible. 
We have learned something new: water that holds | 
carbonic-acid gas will dissolve a small quantity of / 
limestone. 
‘‘Something else we are to learn, and then my 
demonstration will be finished. If this clear water 
with carbonate of lime in solution were allowed 
to stand a few days, the carbonic-acid gas would 
eradually escape, just as the same gas escapes 
from wine left standing for some time in a glass; 
and the lime, no longer held in solution by the pres- 
ence of carbonic acid, would reappear as chalk-dust, ; V 
and so the liquid would again take on a milky 
cloudiness. But this return to the milky state can 
be hastened: we have only to heat the liquid to drive 
out the carbonic-acid gas, whereupon the chalk again 
becomes visible and is deposited as a white powder. 
Thus it is made plain to us, first, that water con-' 
taining carbonic-acid gas will hold a small amount 
of limestone in solution, and, secondly, that this dis- 
solved limestone reappears and forms a deposit as 
soon as the water loses its carbonic-acid gas either 
by long exposure to the air or by the action of heat. 
‘‘Now, carbonic-acid gas escapes from the soil in 
many places,—as, for example, in the Dog’s Grotto 
with its stream of suffocating gas. Elsewhere the 
atmosphere always contains some of this gas, if 
 
-P-A-G-E-324
316 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
only what comes from the fuel burned in our fire- 
places and stoves. Rain, in falling through and 
washing the atmosphere, and springs gushing up 
from under the ground thus meet with carbonic-acid 
gas on their way, and some of this they absorb and 
carry along with them. Afterward, as they flow 
over the soil, they are likely to become charged with 
limestone, which occurs in widespread abundance. 
Such is the origin of the carbonate of lime found in 
solution in most water. If now the carbonic-acid 
gas escapes, little by little, from prolonged exposure 
to the air, the carbonate resumes its stony form and 
is deposited on whatever objects may be in the 
water. In this way are formed the calcareous in- 
crustations, or limestone coatings, that line and 
sometimes stop up our water-mains and the conduit 
pipes of fountains. 
‘*To be potable—or, in other words, to be fit for 
drinking—water should contain a little limestone in 
solution; and, after what I have just told you about 
the formation of our bones, you will see plainly 
enough the reason. But when it contains too much, 
it is hard to digest and oppresses the stomach. The 
proper proportion is from one to two decigrams, or 
about a pinch, to a liter of water. Where there is 
more, the water is what we call hard; or we say it 
is heavy, because it weighs on the stomach after 
being drunk. 
‘Water is sometimes so rich in limestone that it 
quickly encrusts any object immersed in it. You 
may have seen springs or brooks that coat with 
stony matter any blades of grass or tufts of moss 
 
-P-A-G-E-325
    DIFFERENT KINDS OF WATER 317 
they may encounter in their course, forming thus 
a kind of light rock called tufa. Some of these ecal- 
careous springs are quite famous, as, for instance, 
that of Saint Allyre at Clermont-Ferrand. The 
water from this celebrated spring falls on a tangle 
of brush and is thus turned to spray, which is put 
to service by persons having objects they wish 
coated with limestone, such as birds’ nests, baskets 
of fruit, bouquets of foliage and flowers. The car- 
bonic-acid gas that helps to hold the limestone in 
solution escapes, and the spray deposits a coating 
‘of stone, so that birds’ nests, baskets of fruit, and 
bouquets, all appear to be petrified. One would 
almost think a clever sculptor had carved these ob- 
jects out of marble. Needless to add, such water 
is not suitable for drinking.’’ 
‘*T should say not,’’ Emile agreed; ‘‘the stomach 
would get a lining of stone, which would not be 
very easy to digest.”’ 
‘‘The water we use for household purposes never 
contains such an abundance of stony matter, but it 
often does have enough to cause inconvenience, es- 
pecially in washing. You must have noticed that 
water in which linen has been washed with soap is 
more or less whitish. This whiteness is not due 
to the soap, for in pure water, such as rain-water, 
soap dissolves with hardly any effect on the trans- 
parency of the liquid, certainly without turning it 
to a milky whiteness. If ordinary water whitens 
with soap, it is due wholly to the stony matter in 
solution. When water whitens a good deal in laun- 
dry work and is filled with clots of soap, it is a sure
-P-A-G-E-326
818 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
sign that it contains too much mineral matter. 
Washing is then rendered difficult, and soap dis- 
solves poorly and is wasted in forming flakes with- 
out acting on the impurities in what is being washed. 
‘‘Water of this sort is bad, too, for certain kinds 
of cooking, especially for boiling vegetables such as 
dried peas, beans, lentils, and chick-peas, more par- 
ticularly the last-named. The stony material in the 
water impregnates the peas or beans or other vege- 
tables, and you could boil them all day without 
making them soft. Water of this kind is, of course, 
as unfit for drinking purposes as for cooking; it 
overburdens the stomach with its excess of mineral 
matter. 
‘‘Now that we are on the subject, let us finish 
enumerating the qualities that water should have 
in order to be good for drinking. It should hold in 
solution a little air. We will heat some water, and 
as soon as it begins to get hot we shall see tiny 
bubbles rising from the bottom. These bubbles are 
not bubbles of steam, for the temperature is not yet 
high enough to make steam. They are bubbles of 
air, air that was held in solution and is now driven 
out by the heat. Well, this dissolved air is essential 
to water used for drinking. If it is not present, the 
water is somewhat disagreeable to the taste and 
may even provoke nausea. That is why tepid water 
that has recently cooled down from the boiling-point 
is not good to drink. The best water, then, is spring 
water, running water, because its continual motion 
brings it into contact with and enables it to absorb 
the greatest possible amount of air. Stagnant 
   
-P-A-G-E-327
  DIFFERENT KINDS OF WATER 319 
water, on the contrary, water that stands still in 
some ditch, we will say, and is brought .but little 
into contact with the air, is of inferior quality and 
often positively injurious to the health, especially 
when decaying vegetable matter is found in it. 
‘‘Ordinary water, as I have said, nearly always 
has a little carbonic-acid gas in solution. I will add 
that certain springs contain so much that they effer- 
vesce and have a slightly acid taste. These are 
called effervescent mineral springs, and to them 
belong Selzer, Vichy, and other well-known springs. 
The water from these is often used for medicinal 
purposes. 
‘But enough on the subject of carbonic-acid gas 
in water. Let us conclude to-day’s lesson with a 
few words on the dangers that lurk in gases com- 
posed of carbon combined with oxygen. I say 
‘gases’ and not ‘gas,’ because the combustion of 
carbon produces two combinations differing from 
each other in the amount of oxygen they contain. 
The one that is burned the more,—or, in other 
words, oxidized the more, and so is the richer in 
oxygen,—is carbonic-acid gas, with which we are now 
well acquainted; the one that is burned less com- 
pletely, and so is less rich in oxygen, is called 
carbon monoxid. Unquestionably the first-named 
is a formidable gas and one to be guarded against, 
as it is likely to accumulate where it will be a 
menace to human life, and does so to a notable ex- 
tent in wine-cellars. Any one forced to breathe such 
an atmosphere even for a few minutes would surely 
die unless there were help at hand to resuscitate the
-P-A-G-E-328
320 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
victim. Yet carbonic-acid gas is not a poison. We 
drink askitiJe of it in ordinary water, and much more 
of it in effervescent drinks; we eat it, so to speak, 
in our daily bread, which is full of pores made by 
this gas when the dough fermented; we breathe it 
constantly, as it is always present in the atmosphere 
about us; and, finally, the human body itself is a 
perpetual source of carbonic-acid gas thrown off in 
breathing. It is plain, then, that it is not a poison. 
If it causes death on being breathed in an unmixed 
state, that is due to no injurious properties in the 
gas itself, but merely because it cannot supply the 
place of air, the only breathable gas we have any 
knowledge of. Nitrogen will cause death in the 
same way. 
‘‘Carbon monoxid is quite different: it is really 
poisonous, a very harmful gas that acts fatally even 
when breathed in only small quantities and mixed 
with a good deal of air. It is the more dangerous 
in that it forms daily in our houses and nothing 
shows its presence. It is invisible and odorless, an 
enemy that makes itself known only when the dam- 
age has been done. We hear from time to time 
of some unfortunate person who, either by inad- 
vertence or, as occasionally happens, by intention 
and from lack of courage to continue the battle of 
life, dies an untimely death in a closed room con- 
taining a charcoal heater. Carbon monoxid is the 
cause of these lamentable occurrences. Inhaled 
even in a small quantity, it provokes first a violent 
headache and general discomfort, then loss of feel- 
ing, giddiness, nausea, and extreme weakness, 
 
-P-A-G-E-329
    DIFFERENT KINDS OF WATER 321 
While this state continues life is in danger, and 
death may come at any moment. 
‘<Tt will be well for us to know under what con- 
ditions this terrible gas is produced. Since carbon 
monoxid is carbon less completely burned than when 
it becomes carbonic-acid gas, it is plain that what 
ever hinders combustion without stopping it entirely 
tends to produce this gas. If the draft is poor, if 
the burning fuel lacks a sufficient supply of air, 
carbon monoxid is the inevitable product of this 
imperfect combustion. Remember what takes place 
when a coal fire is started in a furnace. At first, 
the greater part of the fuel being cold and the draft 
of air being sluggish on account of this low tempera- 
ture, combustion is slow and little tongues of blue 
flame make their appearance. Later, when the fire 
is burning briskly, these blue flames are no longer 
to be seen. Well, these tongues of flame having that 
beautiful azure color indicate the presence of carbon 
monoxid, for this gas shows that color in burning 
completely and changing to carbonic-acid gas. 
Whenever you see blue flames over a mass of burn- 
ing coal, you may be sure carbon monoxid is feeding 
those flames. 
‘‘T have now told you enough to make you under- 
stand the risk we run when coal or charcoal is 
burned in such a manner that the products of com- 
bustion escape into the room where we are, instead 
of passing up the chimney; and the risk is all the 
greater if the room is small and tightly closed. 
Such a room should never be heated by a brazier, 
in which combustion is always sluggish, and which

  322 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
always gives out more or less of this fatal gas that 
does not. betray its presence by any sign, but comes 
upon us treacherously and by surprise. Death may 
occur even before any danger is suspected. The 
headache often felt when one is near a stove or a 
brazier, or even a foot-warmer containing live coals, 
is the only warning this terrible gas gives. Let us 
heed this warning and look to our safety. 
‘‘It is always very imprudent to close the damper 
of a bedroom stove in order to keep a low fire during 
the night. The smoke-pipe being thus closed by the 
damper and affording no sufficient outlet for the 
products of combustion, the draft is checked and 
carbon monoxid forms and spreads through the 
room, suffocating the sleepers. If a room is small 
and unventilated, a foot-warmer containing live 
coals is enough to give a headache and even cause 
more serious results.’’

66w SHALL never forget,’’? Uncle Paul resumed, 
I ‘how rudely one of my friends was treated 
by a noted cook. One gala day he found the kitchen 
artist meditating on the triumphs of his profes- 
sion, as he stood watching the various processes 
going on in his steaming pots and pans. Broad of 
face, with a wealth of chins one under another, an 
opulent nose richly adorned with pimples, a majestic — 
stomach, napkin tucked under his waistband, cap of 
snowy linen—such was the man. 
‘‘The saucepans were simmering on the stove, 
and from under the lids came whiffs of odors so 
delicious that one could almost have dined by smel- 
ling them. A fat capon stuffed with truffles and a 
young turkey decorated with slices of bacon were 
roasting on the spit. At one side a fat thrush red- 
olent of juniper was bestowing a part of its succu- 
lence on a slice of buttered toast. 
‘** Well,’ said my friend, after the customary 
greetings, pointing to one of the saucepans, ‘what 
masterpiece of your art have we here?’ 
‘¢*Ragout of hare with plovers,’ replied the 
artificer of tempting dishes, beaming with satisfac- 
tion and licking his fingers as he lifted the lid. 
Immediately there was wafted through the room a 
323
-P-A-G-E-332
324 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
smell fit to awaken the demon of sensuality in the 
most abstemious. 
‘‘My friend uttered words of high praise, and 
then continued: 
‘**¢You are clever, as every one admits; but 
zounds! it ’s not so very difficult a matter to cook 
good dishes when you have good materials to start 
with, to make the mouth water when you have a 
fat capon at your disposal, or to create a most 
appetizing odor with a brace of plovers. The ideal 
achievement would be to produce a roast or a ragout 
with no capon, no hare, no bird or beast of any 
kind. The old recipe, to make a hare pie, first catch 
your hare, is too exacting. Hares are not running 
about for every one to catch. It would be more 
convenient if we could take something else, some- 
thing common and easy to get, and make our roast 
or ragout out of that.’ 
‘“'The cook was at a loss how to reply, so evidently 
serious were my friend’s words. 
‘¢ ¢What!’ he exclaimed, ‘a real hare ragout with- 
out any hare, a real roast capon without any capon? 
And you mean to say that you could do that?’ 
‘* “No, not I; I am far from clever enough. But 
I know some one who is clever enough, and com- 
pared with whom you and your fellow-artists are 
nothing but clumsy bunglers.’ 
‘‘The cook’s eyes flashed; the artist’s self-esteem 
was wounded to the quick. 
‘¢“And what, if you please, does this master of 
masters use? For I suppose he can hardly produce 
 
-P-A-G-E-333
PLANTS AT WORK 325 
his delectable dishes with nothing at all to work 
with.’ 
‘¢ “fe uses rather poor materials. Would you 
like to see them? Here they are, all complete.’ 
‘‘My friend drew three small vials from his 
pocket. The cook took one. It contained a black 
powder, which the culinary artist felt of, tasted, 
and held to his nose. 
‘* “Tt is charcoal,’ he declared. ‘You are fooling 
me. Your charcoal capons must be fine eating! 
Let me see another of your vials. Ha, this is water, 
or I am much mistaken.’ 
‘<¢You are right; it is water.’ 
‘¢ ‘Now for your third vial. Why, there ’s nothing 
in it!’ 
‘* “Not so fast; there is something in it—air.’ 
‘<*Air! Your air capons ought not to lie very 
heavy on the stomach. Are you in earnest?’ 
‘¢*Very much in earnest.’ 
*< “No joking?’ 
‘< “Not the slightest.’ 
‘‘¢Vour artist makes his capons out of charcoal, 
water, air, and nothing else?’ 
66 ‘Yes.’ 
‘‘The cook’s nose turned blue. 
‘¢ “With water, charcoal, and air you say he could 
make this skewer of thrushes?’ 
mY 6s, yer.’ 
‘<The cook’s nose passed from blue to ‘tolet. 
‘<¢And with charcoal, air, and water he could 
make this pasty of fat goose-livers, and this pigeon 
stew?’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-334
  326 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
‘* “Yes, a hundred thousand times yes!’ 
‘‘The nose, now attaining its last phase, turned 
erimson. The bomb burst. The cook decided that 
the man was a maniac who was making fun of him. 
Accordingly he took my friend by the shoulders, 
spun him round, and propelled him through the 
doorway, throwing his three vials after him. Then 
the irascible nose gradually returned from crimson 
to violet, from violet to blue, and from that to its 
normal tint; but the demonstration to prove that a 
capon can be made out of charcoal, air, and water 
was never carried through.’’ 
‘‘Of course your friend was only in fun, was n’t 
he, with those three vials?’’ asked Jules. 
‘‘Not at all. His three vials really contained the 
wherewithal to make the dishes the cook was pre- 
paring. Have I not already shown you that char- 
coal, or carbon, goes to the making of bread, meat, 
milk, and countless other things we use as food? 
Remember the slice of bread left toasting too long, 
and the mutton-chop forgotten on the broiler.’’ 
*‘T see now. Your friend was speaking of the 
chemical elements. Carbon is one, and that was in 
the first of the three vials. How about the other 
two?’’ 
‘<The second is just as easy to account for. Hold 
a pane of glass over the smoke rising from a slice 
of bread when it is just beginning to burn on the 
stove, and you will soon see the glass covered with 
a fine film of moisture, exactly as if you had breathed 
upon it. This moisture comes from the rising 
vapor, and the latter from the bread. Therefore 
   
-P-A-G-E-335
PLANTS AT WORK 327 
bread contains water, considerable water in fact, 
however dry it may appear to be. If we could 
extract all its moisture from a mouthful of bread, 
you would be surprised at its quantity. It would 
astonish you to learn how much water we eat at 
every meal.”’ 
‘‘But we don’t eat water, we drink it,’’ objected 
Emile. 
‘‘T say we eat it, for as it is found in bread it does 
not run, does not wet anything, does not quench 
thirst. It is solid rather than liquid, dry rather 
than wet, something to be chewed rather than drunk. 
Or, better, it is no longer water, but something else 
that unites with air and carbon to make bread.”’ 
‘‘Well,’’? assented the boy, ‘‘I ’ll admit there must 
be water in bread because it shows on a piece of 
glass held over a slice of toast that is beginning to 
burn. But there is still another vial to account 
for,—the one with air.’’ 
‘‘Mere it will be impossible, with the simple 
means at our disposal, to furnish proof. Of the 
three substances named as being present in our food 
I have accounted for two, carbon and water; the 
presence of the third you must accept on faith.’’ 
‘‘Agreed unanimously: there is air in bread. 
‘What other wonderful things are you going to tell 
us about?’’ 
‘We will see. This much, first, is agreed upon: 
bread is composed of carbon, air, and water, which 
combine in a certain way, merge into one another, 
and cease to be merely carbon, air, and water, by 
becoming something else quite different from any 
 
-P-A-G-E-336
  328 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
one of the three. White has come out of black, 
savor out of insipidity, nutritive qualities out of 
innutritious things. 
‘“Meat subjected to the action of fire teaches 
the same lesson: it turns to carbon and emits fumes 
containing the constituents of air and water. We 
will go no farther, for our inquiries would always 
meet with the same answer. All that we eat or 
drink, all that goes to nourish us, is reducible to 
water, carbon, and air. Everything found in an 
animal’s body, everything in a plant, is, with very 
few exceptions, made of nothing that is not found 
in water, carbon, or air. Let us be still more ex- 
plicit. Carbon, being a simple substance, an ele- 
ment, is always carbon and nothing else; but water 
is composed of hydrogen and oxygen, and air of 
oxygen and nitrogen. (Hence the four elements, car- 
bon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen, are the ma- 
terials of which all things in the plant and animal 
world are almost entirely made}, 
‘‘So my friend with his three vials was speaking 
the truth,-for all the savory dishes prepared by the 
cook were reducible to carbon, air, and water. In 
those little bottles were actually the elements, the 
prime ingredients, contained in roast capons, pigeon 
stews, pasties of fat goose-livers, cream tarts, and 
so on; but to put them together and make them into 
food, which chemistry in its brutal operations knows 
only how to destroy, the artist was lacking, the a 
artist of whom my friend spoke.’’ 
‘‘And who is this artist?’’ 
‘*Vegetation, my young friends, or, more par- 
 
-P-A-G-E-337
    PLANTS AT WORK 329 
ticularly, grass. At the grand banquet spread for 
all the world, three dishes only are served, though 
they take an infinite variety of forms. From the 
epicure who dines on the choicest of delicacies con- 
tributed by every quarter of the globe, to the oyster 
that fills its belly with slime washed up by the 
waves; from the oak whose roots suck in nourish- 
ment from an acre of ground, to the mold on a piece 
of cheese—all draw upon the same source of sup- 
plies, all feed on carbon, air, and water. The only 
difference lies in the way these ingredients are 
prepared. Both wolf and man—the latter not unlike 
a wolf in his kind of food and in other respects 
also—eat their carbon as it is served to them in 
sheep, while the sheep finds its carbon in grass, and 
grass— Ah! here we come to the point that shows 
vegetation to be the feeder of the world, with wolf, 
sheep, and man wholly at its mercy. 
‘‘In animal flesh both man and wolf find carbon, 
air, and water served up in compact form as a 
savory dish, while in grass the sheep finds them 
just as skilfully prepared, though less savory and 
less compact in form. But vegetation itself, so 
nourishing to the sheep, so well fitted to be made 
into sheep’s flesh for the sustenance of man and for 
the building of his body—with what sauce does it 
eat its carbon and air and water? 
‘‘Tt eats them with no sauce whatever, but in 
their natural state, or very nearly so. Blessed with 
a stomach truly marvelous in its capabilities, the 
plant digests carbon and takes in air and water, 
and out of these three substances, which no other
-P-A-G-E-338
  330 THE’ WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
form of life will deign to touch as nutriment, makes 
the forage that hands on to the sheep its needed 
supply of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen, 
all thenceforth united in nutritious form. The 
sheep takes up the preparation of these elements as 
found in the blade of grass and carries it further, 
improving it a little and turning it into flesh that 
finally, by the slightest possible change, becomes 
man’s or wolf’s flesh, according to the consumer.’’ 
‘*T begin to see how it all comes about,’’ said 
_ Jules: ‘‘man makes his flesh from sheep’s flesh and 
from the various other things he eats, the sheep 
makes its flesh from the grass it browses, and grass 
is made of carbon and the elements in air and water. 
So it is the plant that, in the beginning, prepares all 
~ our food for us.’’ 
‘*Yes, the plant, and only the plant, has that im- 
portant task. Man gets the materials of his body 
either from the plant itself or from the sheep and 
other animals that contain those materials already 
prepared; the sheep or other grazing animal gets 
them from the plant, where they are found in an 
advanced stage of preparation; and the plant alone 
gets them from the original source, eating the un- 
eatable, carbon and the elements in air and water, 
and, by a marvelous process of which it alone knows 
the secret, converting them into nutriment fit for 
the sustenance of animal life. So, then, it is vegeta- 
tion, finally, that spreads a table for all the earth’s 
inhabitants. Were its work to cease, all forms of 
animal life, absolutely all, unable to derive nourish- 
ment from carbon in its natural state or from air or 
 
-P-A-G-E-339
  PLANTS AT WORK 331 
water, would perish of hunger, the sheep for want 
of grass, the wolf for want of sheep, and man for 
want of any and every kind of food. 
‘‘T see now,’’ said Emile, ‘‘why you called the 
plant the great artist that knows how to make every- 
thing with what was in your friend’s vials. It does 
it all with carbon, air, and water.’’ 
‘“The plant does not eat as we do: it soaks in its 
food; that is, carbon, for example, is not consumed 
by it in the natural state known to you as fine black 
powder, but after it has first been changed from its 
solid form and dissolved. Now, the solvent of car- 
bon is oxygen, which converts it into carbonic-acid 
gas, and that is the plant’s chief food.’’ 
‘*You say plants live on carbonic-acid gas, that 
fatal gas that kills us if we breathe a few breaths 
of it?”’ 
‘“Yes, my lad, it lives on what would kill us, pre- 
pares our food by using what would be death to us if 
there were enough of it around us. Remember that 
whatever breathes, whatever burns, whatever fer- 
ments, whatever decays, sends out carbonic-acid gas © 
into the atmosphere. The atmosphere, receiving 
these fatal emanations, would therefore in the course 
of centuries become unbreathable and suffocating 
to all animal life on the earth if other agencies did 
not forestall this accumulation of the deadly gas. 
Let us now see, to begin with, what statistics have 
to say as to the amount of carbonic-acid gas that is 
continually being produced. 
‘“The carbonic-acid gas exhaled by a man in twen- 
ty-four hours is estimated at about four hundred
-P-A-G-E-340
  3382 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
and fifty liters, which would represent two hundred 
and forty grams of burnt carbon and four hundred 
and fifty liters of oxygen taken from the air to 
effect this combustion. At this rate the carbonic- 
acid gas produced in a year by the whole human 
family would amount to about one hundred and 
sixty billion cubic meters, which represents eighty- 
six billion, two hundred and seventy million kilo- 
grams of burnt carbon. Piled in one heap, this 
carbon would make a mountain a league around at 
its base and from four hundred to five hundred me- 
ters high. Such is the quantity of fuel required 
for the maintenance of man’s natural heat. All 
of us together eat carbon to this extent, and in the 
course of a year we breathe it out, a breath at a 
time, in the form of carbonic-acid gas. Then we 
start on the consumption of another pile of the 
same size. How many mountains of carbon, then, 
since the world began, must mankind have breathed 
out into the atmosphere! 
‘We have also to take into account the vast variety 
and extent of animal life on land and in the sea, 
and its requirements in the way of carbon, require- 
ments that would in the course of a year represent 
a mountain of perhaps the size of Mont Blane. <Ani- 
mals far outnumber us, abounding as they do all 
over the earth, including oceans as well as con-. 
tinents. What a quantity of carbon to keep the 
flame of life burning! And to think that it all 
sooner or later goes into the air as a fatal gas, a 
few breaths of which would quickly kill us! 
‘‘Nor is that the whole story. Fermenting sub- 
 
-P-A-G-E-341
    PLANTS AT WORK 00 
stances, like the juice of the grape and like the 
dough that is to be baked into bread, and all decay- 
ing matter,—such as, for instance, is found in the 
form of. manure spread over a cultivated field,— 
these, too, are rich sources of carbonic-acid gas. 
Even if the manure is of no great strength it will 
send out one hundred cubic meters or more of car- 
bonic-acid gas in a single day for every acre of land 
on which it is spread. 
‘‘Coal, wood, charcoal, and other fuel used for 
heating our houses, and the great quantities of coal 
needed for running our factories—do not these also 
contribute to the atmosphere their share of the 
harmful gas we are speaking of? Just think of the 
quantity of carbonic-acid gas vomited into the air 
from the smoke-stack of a great factory that con- 
sumes coal by the car-load! Think, too, of the vol- 
canoes, those giant natural chimneys that in a single 
eruption throw up enough of this gas to make the 
belchings of a factory furnace seem like a mere 
whiff on the breeze. 
‘*Tt is evident that carbonic-acid gas is constantly 
being poured into the atmosphere in torrents that 
defy computation; and yet animal life has no rea- 
son to fear suffocation, either now or in the future. 
The atmosphere, continually being tainted, is as 
continually being purified: as fast as it is laden with 
carbon it is purged of it. Now, the health-officer 
charged with the safeguarding of the general physi- 
cal welfare is the plant, my little friends, the plant 
that lives on carbonic-acid gas to prevent our dying 
by breathing it, and with it prepares the food that
-P-A-G-E-342
  334 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
is to sustain us. This fatal gas in which is taken 
up so much of the putrefaction of all things is the 
plant’s chief sustenance. To the plant’s wonderful 
stomach, putrefaction is satisfaction. What death 
has cut down, the blade of grass builds up again. — 
‘‘Tt is plain enough that there is never any lack of 
carbonic-acid gas in the air we breathe, and also 
that it does not accumulate to the point of becoming 
a menace to life, as one might at first infer from 
the abundance in which it is produced. In this dish 
is some lime-water that I poured out yesterday, 
when it was perfectly clear. Look at the surface 
and you will see a delicate transparent crust, which 
cracks and breaks if you touch it with the point of a 
pin. It might be taken for a thin sheet of ice. 
What can it be? The answer is plain: the air, 
coming into contact with lime-water, has yielded to 
the latter some of its carbonic-acid gas, and car- 
bonate of lime has consequently formed, not in this 
instance as a white chalky powder, but as a trans- 
parent crystalline sheet.’’ ‘ 
**T ’ve often noticed,’’ said Jules, ‘‘the same sort 
of crust on water in which lime has been slaked 
for making mortar. I should have taken it for ice, 
but as it did n’t melt in the summer sun I concluded 
it must be something else.’’ 
‘‘TIt was carbonate of lime, formed exactly like 
that in this dish by the union of carbonic-acid gas 
from the atmosphere with lime dissolved in the 
water. Now that our talk has led to this subject, 
let us say a little more about mason’s mortar. You 
know how it is prepared. The lime-burner first 
 
-P-A-G-E-343
  PLANTS AT WORK 335 fr ft}, 
heats a mass of broken limestone very hot in a lime- 
kiln, and the heat drives out the carbonic-acid gas, 
leaving the lime by itself. This lime the mason 
slakes with water and mixes with sand, thus pro- 
ducing mortar, which is laid by the trowel between 
the stones that go to make a building. At first a 
soft paste that readily fills in all empty spaces, 
it gradually becomes impregnated with carbonic 
acid from the atmosphere, this process being aided 
by the loosely compacted grains of sand in the 
mortar, and finally, in consequence of the union 
of the carbonic acid with the lime, turns to stone 
as hard and firm as that from which the lime was 
originally produced. In course of time, therefore, 
the hardening of the mortar being accomplished, the 
entire structure of stone and mortar becomes welded 
into one solid mass, so that often the stones them- 
selves, if one tries to separate them, will break 
before the mortar will relax its hold. It is, then, 
carbonic-acid gas from the atmosphere that hardens |\ 
the mason’s mortar by turning the lime it contains © 
back into limestone. 
‘‘There is always, as I have said, carbonic-acid 
gas in the air around us: the hardening of mortar 
and the forming of a brittle crust on lime-water 
when exposed to the air prove this sufficiently. But 
there is not much of this gas thus floating about 
us; for if the chemist subjects the air to delicate 
tests such as are beyond the resources of our modest 
laboratory, he finds that never and nowhere is there 
more than one liter of carbonic-acid gas in two 
thousand liters of air. What becomes, then, of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-344
  3386 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
enormous volumes of this gas continually being 
added to the atmosphere? Vegetation feeds upon 
it and thus causes it to disappear, as we shall soon 
see. 
‘‘The surface of a leaf is riddled with numerous 
excessively small holes called stomata, or mouths. 
On a single leaf more than a million can be counted; 
but, being so thickly assembled in so small a space, 
they are of course too small to be seen without a 
magnifying-glass, a microscope. I cannot show 
them to you in their natural state, but only as repre- 
sented in this picture. Well, through these tiny 
mouths the plant breathes, not pure air as we do, 
but poisoned air, fatal to 
the animal, but life-giving 
to the plant. It inhales, 
through these millions 
of myriads of stomata, 
Stomata, highly magnified. the carbonic-acid gas dis- 
persed throughout the atmosphere, receiving it 
into the substance of the leaves, where under the 
action of the sun’s rays an incomprehensible process 
is accomplished. Stimulated by the light of the 
sun, the leaves work upon the fatal gas and rid it 
completely of its carbon. In other words, they de- 
compose the carbonic-acid gas, undo what combus- 
tion has done, separate the carbon from the oxygen 
combined with it. 
‘¢You must not think it is any easy task to restore 
to their original condition two substances combined 
by burning, by oxidizing. The chemist will have to 
exercise his utmost ingenuity and use his most po- 
   
-P-A-G-E-345
    PLANTS AT WORK 337 
tent drug's if he wishes to break the hold that carbon 
and oxygen have on each other in carbonic-acid gas. 
Well, it is just this task, which would tax the re- 
sources of a chemical laboratory, that the leaves 
accomplish quietly, without effort, instantaneously, 
but only on the express condition that the sun gives 
its aid. 
‘*Tf the sun does not shine, the plant can do noth- 
ing with carbonic-acid gas, which is its chief food. 
Then it languishes in a half-starved condition, reach- 
ing out as if seeking the much-needed light and los- 
ing the green color, the hue of health, from its leaves 
and stems, until finally it perishes. This sickly state 
caused by lack of light is called etiolation, or bleach- 
ing. In market-gardening it is resorted to for the 
purpose of making certain vegetables more tender 
and their flavor less strong. Thus it is customary 
to tie closely together the stems or stalks of a plant 
used for salad, in this way keeping the sunlight 
from the central portion and causing it to turn 
white and tender. So, too, it is usual to heap up the 
earth around the stalks of artichokes and celery, as 
their flavor would be unbearable without this treat- 
ment of darkness. Lay a tile flat on the grass, or in- 
vert a flower-pot over a plant, and after a few days 
you will find the matted grass or the shaded plant 
yellow and sickly. 
‘‘But when, on the other hand, a plant receives the 
sun’s rays in full force, carbonic-acid gas is decom- 
posed in no time, the carbon and the oxygen separ- 
ating and each resuming its original attributes. 
Freed of its load of carbon, the oxygen becomes
-P-A-G-E-346
  338 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
again what it was before the union took place; it is 
once more a breathable gas, if diluted with nitrogen, 
a gas that will support life and make a fire burn. 
In this pure state it is given out by the stomata to 
take its part again in combustion and respiration. 
It entered the leaves a fatal gas, it departs a vivi- 
fying gas. It will find its way back some day with 
a fresh load of carbon, deposit its burden in the 
plant’s storehouse, and, once more purified, recom- 
mence its atmospheric round. Bees go and come, 
one after another, from the hive to the fields and 
from the fields to the hive, by turn, in the one in- 
stance lightened of their heavy load and eager for a 
fresh burden, and in the other laden with honey 
and winging their way heavily back to the 
hive. Oxygen is the swarm of the plant hive: it 
reaches the stomata with a load of carbon taken 
from the veins of animals, from burning fuel, or, it 
may be, from substances undergoing decay, and it 
gives this carbon to the plant and then departs on its 
untiring round. 
‘‘As to the carbon that the leaves separate from 
the oxygen, it remains in the plant and enters into 
the composition of the sap, turning finally into sugar, 
gum, oil, starch, wood, or some other vegetable sub- 
stance. Sooner or later these substances are decom- 
posed by the slow combustion of decay, or by the 
less gradual combustion that takes place in animal 
nutrition, and the carbon once more enters into the 
formation of carbonic-acid gas and returns to the 
atmosphere to feed another generation of plant life, 
which will hand on to animal! life the food products 
 
-P-A-G-E-347
  PLANTS AT WORK 339 
it has with the help of this carbon manufactured. 
‘‘Now I will ask Emile if he remembers that 
old tree stump we were talking about that was some 
day, it might be, to contribute its carbon to the mak- 
ing of a slice of bread and butter to eat. Does he re- 
member the oak that was to give of its carbon to 
produce a loaf of white bread or some other article 
of food? Was I not right in saying it is quite pos- 
sible that to-day we eat, in the form of a buttered 
roll, what we some time before burned on the hearth 
as a stick of wood?’’ 
‘<T have n’t in the least forgotten,’’ replied Emile, 
‘‘how puzzled I was when you told us those things 
might some day give us our bread and butter. Now 
I begin to see how it might come about. A stick 
of wood burns in the fireplace, and its carbon goes 
out of it combined with oxygen, making carbonic- 
acid gas, which is scattered in the air. Plants take 
in this gas as food and, the next thing we know, the 
carbon has turned to flour in the grains of wheat, 
or it may have become grass and been eaten by cows 
to make butter; and so we have the slice of bread 
and butter all complete. And then there ’s no rea- 
son why this carbon from the stick of wood, after it 
has traveled through the air, should not become a 
stick of wood again and be burned once more in the 
fireplace, so that it might go the same round again 
and again, no one knows how many times.’’ 
‘*Yes, my boy, it can keep going back and forth in 
that way indefinitely; for the same carbon is for- 
ever passing from atmosphere to plant, from plant 
to animal, and from animal to atmosphere,
-P-A-G-E-348
  340 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
this last being the common storehouse whence 
all forms of life derive the principal material 
of which they are made. Oxygen is the 
common carrier of this material. The animal gets 
its carbon from plants or from other animals, in the 
form of food, and in the end makes carbonic-acid 
gas out of it, with the help of oxygen, and out it goes 
into the air. Plants take this unbreathable gas from 
the air and give back pure oxygen in return, using 
the carbon in making food for men and animals. 
Thus the two kingdoms, animal and vegetable, help 
each other, the former making carbonic-acid gas to 
feed the latter, and this in turn making breathable 
air and nutritious substances out of the fatal gas.’’ 
‘‘Those are the most wonderful things you have 
told us yet,’’ declared Jules, deeply impressed by 
these marvelous transformations. ‘‘When you be- 
gan to tell us about the vials that made the cook’s 
nose turn blue, I thought it was going to be just a 
funny story, and never dreamed it would turn out 
to be so interesting and so serious.’’ 
‘*Yes, my child, what I have just told you is indeed 
interesting and serious, perhaps too serious for one 
So young as you; but I could not resist the tempta- 
tion to acquaint you with the beautiful concord ex- 
isting between the plant that feeds the animal and 
the animal that feeds the plant. 
‘‘Let us now descend from these heights and go 
on to another experiment. We wish to prove that 
plants do really decompose earbonic-acid gas. The 
simplest way to do this is to let the operation go on 
under water, a method that enables us to observe 
 
-P-A-G-E-349
     
      PLANTS AT WORK 341 
the release of the gas,—that is the oxygen,—and to 
collect it. Ordinary water always contains a little 
carbonic-acid gas in solution, obtained either from 
the soil or from the atmosphere; therefore we shall 
not have to supply this to the immersed plant. 
‘‘Into a wide-mouthed glass jar filled with ordi- 
nary water we put a recently cut plant in full leaf. 
A water-plant is preferable, as with it quicker and 
longer-continued results are obtained. We next in- 
vert the jar with its mouth in a bowl of water, and 
then set the whole thing in the sunlight. Soon the 
leaves are covered with tiny bead-like bubbles, which 
rise to the upper end of the inverted jar and accum- 
ulate there, forming a layer of gas. This gas, as 
has been proved by trial, will rekindle a match that 
has just been extinguished, provided it has a spark 
left; and thus the gas is shown to be oxygen. Hence 
the carbonic-acid gas dissolved in the water must 
have been resolved by the leaves into its original 
elements, the oxygen being set free and the carbon 
remaining in the leaves. 
‘But let us put aside our laboratory outfit and re- 
sort to the simplest possible proof of the fact in 
question. Let us go to the nearest pond, where, in 
some stretch of still water, we shall find a popula- 
tion of tadpoles living and flourishing, either lying 
in the sun at the water’s edge or swimming out into 
the deeper part, where they frisk and play in free- 
dom. In this pond, also, are to be found various 
mollusks crawling slowly along, and small shell-fish 
propelling themselves by jerks as they lash the 
water with the end of their tail; larve, too, encased
-P-A-G-E-350
  342 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
in little molds of fine sand, and black leeches lying 
in wait for their prey; and finally, sticklebacks, 
graceful little fish armed with spines on the back— 
hence the name. 
‘‘All these creatures, of whatever sort, breathe 
oxygen but it is oxygen held in solution by the water. 
If the vivifying gas were lacking in the pond, all 
this teeming population would infallibly perish. An- 
other danger menaces it, also. The bed of the pond 
is black mud, being an accumlation of decaying 
matter such as rotting leaves, dead plants, ejections 
from the aquatic population, the lifeless bodies of 
various kinds of tiny creatures, and other refuse. 
This bed of decomposing matter is continually 
throwing off carbonic- 
acid gas, as fatal for 
» the stickleback and the 
tadpole to breathe as 
for us. How, then, 
is the water kept clear of this unbreathable gas 
and enriched with life-giving oxygen for the main- 
tainence of the pond’s population? 
‘‘Water-plants perform this office of sanitation by 
feeding on the dissolved carbonic-acid gas, decom- 
posing it under the sun’s rays, and giving out oxy- 
gen in its place. Decay supports the plant, and the 
plant supports the animal. Among the various 
kinds of plants entrusted with the sanitation of 
stagnant water I will mention the conferve, that is 
to say the delicate, green, thread-like growths that 
overlay the floor of the pond or other body of fresh 
water with a sort of thick velvet carpet, or float 
   
-P-A-G-E-351
  PLANTS AT WORK 343 
about in jelly-like flakes. Put one of these plants 
into a bottle of water, and after a short exposure to 
the direct rays of the sun you will see the plant 
covered with innumerable tiny beads of gas. These 
are bubbles of oxygen from decomposed carbonic- 
acid gas. Caught in the sticky network of the water- 
plant, these bubbles increase until they finally buoy 
up the plant and so raise it, all covered with foam, 
to the surface of the water. 
‘‘This experiment calls for no special outfit. 
Break off a green fragment from some aquatic plant, 
put it into a glass of water, set the glass in the sun, 
and soon you will see your little oxygen factory in 
‘full operation. When the process is well under way, 
set the glass in the shade, and the release of gas will 
stop at once; but put the glass back in the sun, and 
the formation of gas-bubbles will promptly begin 
again, thus proving the need of the sun’s rays in 
this wonderful process. I cannot imagine a more 
beautiful or lucid experiment. It is, too, so simple 
that I leave you to perform it yourselves. 
“*The bit of green water-plant making breathable 
gas in a glass of water set in the sun, will enable you 
to understand the work of sanitation accomplished 
in large bodies of water by aquatic vegetation just as 
a like purification of the atmosphere is effected by 
terrestrial vegetation.) All the green plants of vari- 
ous kinds growing in a standing body of fresh 
water become covered with tiny beads of oxygen if 
they receive the sun’s rays to help them in their 
work, and this oxygen dissolves in the water and 
gives it new life. It is thus by means of the lowest
-P-A-G-E-352
344 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
forms of vegetation that standing water, instead of 
becoming pestilential, ‘may be kept in a condition 
to support innumerable species of aquatic life. 
‘“H'rom all this you may learn a little lesson that 
will perhaps be of use to you. How many times you 
have tried to keep sticklebacks alive in a glass jar! 
But the attempt has always failed. In water not 
frequently renewed the little fish soon died, perish- 
ing as soon as the small amount of oxygen contained 
in the water was exhausted by their breathing. 
Hereafter, if you wish to succeed, put a good-sized 
clump of conferve into a jar. Plant and fish will 
help each other, the plant supplying the stickleback 
with oxygen, and the stickleback providing ecar- 
bonic-acid gas for the plant; so both will prosper 
even in unrenewed water. In short, then, if you 
would keep your water animals alive, do not forget 
to give them their indispensable companions, water- 
plants.’’

  CHAPTER XXIV 
SULPHUR 
**¢\ ULPHUR is so well known to you that I need 
not describe it. It is found chiefly in the 
neighborhood of volcanoes, where masses of it are 
unearthed, sometimes in a perfectly pure state, some- 
times mixed with soil and stones. In the latter case 
it has to be freed from impurities. 
‘*You have seen sulphur burning in oxygen with 
a beautiful blue flame. This combustion produces a 
gaseous compound of an intensely strong and pene- 
trating smell and provoking a cough when breathed; 
and we call this gas sulphurous oxid. In ordinary 
air sulphur burns more slowly, less brightly, but it 
nevertheless gives the same compound in the end. 
It is this sulphurous gas that makes us cough when 
near burning sulphur, even if it be only the small 
amount of it in a friction match. What use can we 
make of this disagreeable gas, the merest whiff of 
which sets us to coughing as if with the whooping- 
cough? What service can it render us? That shall 
be the subject of our lesson to-day. But first go out 
into the garden and pick me some violets and a 
rose.’’ 
These were promptly brought to Uncle Paul, who 
then placed a little sulphur on a brick, lighted the 
345
-P-A-G-E-354
346 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
sulphur, and held over the flame the bunch of violets, 
having first moistened them slightly. In a few mo- 
ments the flowers thus subjected to the action of the 
sulphurous fumes lost their color and turned quite 
white. The passing from blue to white could be 
seen very plainly, and it did not fail to call forth 
Emile’s usual expression of surprise. 
‘‘Oh, how funny !’’ cried the boy, watching the pro- 
cess closely as his uncle held the violets in the gas 
rising from the burning sulphur. ‘‘See how white 
they turn as soon as they are in the smoke. Some 
are first half-white and half-blue, and then every 
bit of blue fades away and the whole bunch is pure 
white, with the flowers looking almost as fresh as 
before.’’ 
‘‘Now let us try the rose,’’ continued his uncle. 
Accordingly, the rose was held over the burning 
sulphur, whereupon its red color faded in the same 
way and gave place to white, much to the satisfac- 
tion of Jules and Emile, who were already plan- 
ning to repeat for themselves this wonderful exper- 
iment in bleaching, so easy to perform with a piece 
of sulphur and a few flowers. 
‘*So much for that,’’ concluded their uncle, giving 
the boys the bleached rose and violets to examine 
at their leisure. ‘‘What I have just done, you your- 
selves can do with countless other flowers, particu- 
larly red and blue ones; they will all turn white on 
being exposed to the sulphurous gas. Henceforth 
you will know that the pungent vapor of burning sul- 
phur has the peculiarity of destroying certain colors 
 
-P-A-G-E-355
  SULPHUR 347 
and, consequently, of leaving whiteness in their 
place. 
‘‘This peculiarity is turned to account in many 
ways, even having its uses in the household. Let us 
begin with the simplest of these applications. Here 
is a piece of white cotton cloth, percale. I stain it 
with the juice of a very ripe cherry. _Now what we 
have to do is to take out the stain. (At would be an 
all but hopeless task to attempt this with soap, but 
sulphur smoke will do it perfectly and promptly Yor 
as it bleaches flowers so easily it must also take out 
a spot made by cherry juice, both flowers and 
cherries being dyed with a vegetable pigment. I ' 
moisten the spot slightly and hold it over a small 
piece of burning sulphur. To direct the fumes more 
directly upon the desired spot, I cover the sulphur 
with a small paper funnel, inverting it so that it 
may serve as a chimney, and I see that the spot is 
just over the outlet of this funnel. In a moment or 
two the reddish tint fades and gives place to white, 
just as did the color of the rose and that of the vio- 
lets treated in a similar manner. All we have to do 
now is to rinse the bleached part in pure water. 
With this precaution the spot will not reappear. 
That is the way to treat wine stains, which are so 
hard to remove by washing, and all spots made by 
preserved fruit with red juice, such as grapes, cur- 
currants, strawberries, mulberries, blackberries, 
raspberries, and the like. 
‘‘Let us go on to another application even more 
interesting. After all possible washing, neither silk
-P-A-G-E-356
348 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
nor wool, as they come to us in their natural state, 
will show that perfect whiteness so necessary if they 
are to reflect in unimpaired brilliancy and purity the 
dyes with which they are colored. Nor has straw 
used in the making of hats the desired whiteness; 
and the same is true of skins for the manufacture of 
gloves. Well, to whiten wool, silk, straw, and skins 
—that is, to bleach out their natural yellowish tinge 
f —we treat them as the violets and the roses and the 
cherry stain have just been treated. They are first 
slightly dampened and then hung in a tightly closed 
room in which a few handfuls of sulphur are burned 
in an earthen bowl. The room becomes filled with 
the sulphur fumes, and after a day or two the wool 
and silk and straw come out exquisitely white. 
‘¢Sulphur is used for many other purposes, includ- 
ing some that would hardly occur to you. It can 
even put out a fire. Yes, my little friends, sulphur, 
’ which itself burns so readily, will smother flames. ’’ 
‘‘But that,’’ objected Jules, ‘‘is giving the fire 
more fuel, and one of the most inflammable of fuels, 
too. I don’t understand it.’’ 
‘You soon will. What does a fire need to keep 
it burning? Two things, the one as essential as the 
other,—fuel and air. Imagine a great fire. Is it 
not true that if we could eut off its supply of air it 
would speedily go out, and that this would be much 
better than pouring on water? Is it not true also 
that if, instead of giving it air, we could substitute 
a gas unfit for combustion, such as carbonic acid or 
nitrogen, the fire would not continue to burn another 
moment? A lighted candle goes out as soon as it 
 
-P-A-G-E-357
SULPHUR 349 
   
     
     
       
     
   
    
   
    
   
   
   
    
    
   
       
    
       is immersed in either of these gases; and so would 
the best-fed fire in the world if it were suddenly en- 
veloped by a similar atmosphere.”’ 
‘‘T see well enough that if we could pour a perfect 
torrent of nitrogen or carbonic-acid gas on a fire, 
so as to crowd out all the air and completely sur- 
round the burning mass, the flames would be 
smothered at once; but we could n’t do that.”’ 
‘‘Not always. In the open air, I admit, it would 
be hardly practicable; but in a chimney-flue, for ex- 
ample, it is a different matter. There the fire is 
confined in a narrow passage to which air is admit- 
ted through only two openings, and more especially 
through the lower one. In such circumstances it is 
not impracticable to make a stifling gas take the 
place of the air that would otherwise gain admission. 
Suppose a chimney to catch fire. In order to ex- 
tinguish the flames in the quickest and simplest man- 
ner, recourse is had to sulphur. Any gas unfit for 
maintaining combustion and itself incombustible 
would serve; but it is indispensable that this gas be 
obtainable quickly and in abundance, also at little 
expense and without the use of any apparatus. Ni- 
trogen and carbonic-acid gas are here out of the 
question, as it is a difficult, slow, and costly operation 
to produce them. Sulphurous oxid, however, we can 
use, as it is instantly procurable if we have a hand- 
ful of sulphur to throw on the burning coals in the 
fireplace under the burning chimney: No other gas 
could be so easily, quickly, and abundantly produced. 
On the burning brands in the fireplace we throw sul- 
phur without stint, and then shut out the air by
-P-A-G-E-358
350 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
stretching a wet cloth across the opening of the fire- 
place. The sulphur fumes pass up the chimney, 
driving out the air and so extinguishing the burning 
soot.’’ 
‘‘All the same,’’ said Emile, ‘‘it seems queer to 
put out a fire with sulphur. I should never have 
thought of such a thing.’’ 
*.“ Still another use of this same gas is worth men- 
tioning. It has to do with disease and its cure. We 
give the name of parasites to all kinds of little crea- 
tures that live on other creatures, usually establish- 
ing themselves on or in the victim’s body. Despite 
the noble faculties that make him the king of crea- 
tion, man himself plays his part as victim in this 
battle between the devourers and the devoured. He 
has his parasites that live on his substance, just as 
cherries and walnuts have their peculiar insect pests. 
Instances without number, alas, make it all too plain 
that the general rule is applicable to man without 
respect for his superiority in the scale of creation. 
‘‘Besides those powerful and ferocious animals 
like the lion and the tiger, in whose claws man is as 
a mouse in the cat’s clutches—besides formidable 
species of that kind, which we can at least openly 
contend against—we are delivered over to famished 
hordes that by reason of their very smallness 
their multitude, and their secure retreat, are able to 
defy with impunity our efforts at self-protection. 
First it is the mosquito, armed with a poisoned 
_ lancet and sucking our life’s blood from our veins 
without fear of reprisal, and sounding its war 
song in our ears at night as if in mockery of our im- 
 
-P-A-G-E-359
SULPHUR 351 
potent wrath. This war-song is the sharp buzzing 
made by the insect as it approaches us and searches 
our skin for a suitable spot in which to plunge its 
lancet.’’ 
‘‘How often I have slapped myself,’’ said Emile, 
‘‘trying to kill those hateful mosquitos when they 
came and sang their impudent song in my ears in the 
dark!’’ 
‘We have also the louse and the flea, the former 
attacking our head and the latter assailing the whole 
body with irritating bites. 
' Like the mosquito, they are 
after our blood for food; and 
they get it, too, unless the 
utmost attention is paid to 
cleanliness.

Under side ‘of Itch-mite Visible parasite called the 
highly magnified. itch-mite, works its way into 
our skin, in which it tunnels passages somewhat as 
a mole burrows a field. Its mole hills are little 
pimples or pustules that cause acute itching. Such 
is the origin of the ailment known as the itch.”’ 
‘“‘You say itch is caused by a parasite that 
gets into the skin?’’ asked Jules. 
‘“Yes, and the disease spreads by mere contact, as 
the parasite passes readily from one person to 
another, from an infected to an uninfected person.’’ 
‘<And what does it look like, this horrible little 
creature that makes people scratch so?’’

‘*Tt looks like a tiny white speck just big enough 
to be seen by the sharpest eyes, and it is round in 
shape, reminding one a little of the tortoise. It has 
eight legs, two pairs in front and two behind, all 
bristling with sharp, stiff hairs. When it walks it 
spreads out its eight legs; but in repose it draws 
them in under its arched body, very much as a tor- 
toise disposes of its legs under its shell. Finally, 
its mouth is armed with sharp hooks and fine nip- 
pers. With these tools it burrows here and there in 
the skin, making long passages in which it comes and 
goes at will, just as a mole does in the ground. The 
learned word for itch-mite means flesh-cutter. I 
leave you to imagine the unbearable itching this tun- 
neler of human flesh causes when with its well-armed 
beak it cuts and slashes its way in this direction 
and in that.’’ 
‘‘Don’t talk of it any more, Uncle!’’ pleaded Jules. 
‘“TIt makes me want to scratch just to think of it.’’ 
‘‘How is this odious parasite to be got rid of? It 
is hardly visible and lives inside the skin. Think 
of trying to catch it there, when it multiplies by the 
thousand. It is plain that no medicine taken in- 
ternally will be of any use here. To cure the patient 
there is but one remedy,—kill the creature that 
causes the disease. But how kill it in its safe re- 
treat? That is the problem. When a fox commits 
too many misdeeds and makes havoc among the 
neighboring poultry-yards, it is smoked out of its 
hole, stifled in its fortress with burning sulphur until 
it is forced to surrender. So, too, with the itch-mite. 
The patient is stripped and enclosed in a kind of   
-P-A-G-E-361
SULPHUR 353 
tank, his head alone remaining out to allow him to 
breathe, and then sulphur vapor is made to fill the 
tank. If this fumigation is properly conducted the 
insect pest gets enough of it in one turn: it perishes, 
stifled in its retreat, and the patient is cured. 
Truly, it is no small service for which he is in- 
debted to the gas we complain of so loudly when- 
ever the fumes of a lighted match tickle our nose. 
‘‘To finish our talk on sulphurous oxid, I will tell 
you about one of its commonest uses. You know 
how wine is made. I have told you how the sugar in 
the juice of the grape turns to alcohol by fermenting. 
Well, this fermentation may go too far, and then the 
wine sours little by little and turns to vinegar. To 
prevent this deterioration, the process of fermenta- 
tion must be arrested; and this is done by burning 
sulphur in the casks that are to hold the wine. The 
sulphurous gas thus generated purifies the casks, 
even working its way into the wood, and stops the 
fermentation before it goes too far. Thenceforth 
there is no danger of the wine’s turning sour. 
‘‘Sulphurous oxid is the only compound that sul; 
phur forms when burned under ordinary conditions, 
a process you have already witnessed. But I have 
told you of an acid made from sulphur and contain- 
ing more oxygen than is found in sulphurous oxid. 
It is sulphuric acid or oil of vitriol, which we used for 
decomposing water in order to obtain hydrogen. 
How, then, is this acid made, this compound of sul- 
phur with an extra supply of oxygen, when we have 
seen that no matter how much air we give our burn- 
ing sulphur we get nothing but sulphurous oxid? 
 
-P-A-G-E-362

.. 354 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
‘‘Well, we resort to indirect methods much more 
powerful than simple combustion. There are, as 
you know, certain rich storehouses of oxygen,—that 
is to say, certain compounds in which this gas is 
found accumulated in unusual abundance, but not 
firmly fixed. Sometimes a little heat will suffice to 
set free this captive gas. It was thus that chlorid of 
potash, heated by means of a few live coals, was 
made to give us a supply of oxygen. Some of these 
storehouses bursting with oxygen readily give up a 
part of their gas to substances that have either none 
at all or not enough; and to this class belongs nitric 
acid, or aqua fortis, a very useful liquid for oxidiz- 
ing substances or for adding to the oxygen already 
in them. If, then, nitric acid is made to act on sul- 
phurous oxid, which is nothing but incompletely 
burned or oxidized sulphur, the latter takes on addi- 
tional oxygen from the nitric acid and is changed 
into sulphuric acid. Immense factories with tall 
chimneys belching smoke, and with numerous fur- 
naces for burning sulphur, are engaged in the manu- 
facture of this acid, which is used in many branches 
of industry. Sulphurous oxid, made by burning 
either pure sulphur or iron pyrites, in which sulphur 
is abundant, is conducted into enormous leaden 
chambers shaped like our largest rooms. There it 
finds nitric acid, which gives up a part of its oxygen, 
and the transformation is quickly accomplished. 
‘‘Sulphuriec acid is a heavy liquid, much heavier 
than water, and oily in appearance, whence its name 
of oil of vitriol. In a pure state it is colorless, but 
usually it is impure and of a brownish tinge. Mixed 
 
-P-A-G-E-363
    SULPHUR 355 
with water, it generates considerable heat. When we 
were preparing hydrogen, our mixture of sulphuric 
acid and water became burning hot. The combus- 
tion or oxidizing of the zinc, at the expense of the 
oxygen in the water, had a good deal to do with this 
generating of heat; but the interaction of sulphuric 
acid and water had also a part init. Let us study 
this latter process by itself. 
‘‘Into this glass containing only a little water I 
carefully pour some sulphuric acid and stir the 
liquid. The mixture becomes very warm, almost 
hot. Put your hand on the glass and judge for your- 
self.; What can this heat signify except that a chem- 
ical union is taking place between the water and the 
acid? It shows us that sulphuric acid has a strong 
tendency to combine with water. The following is 
another proof of this tendency. Leave a finger’s 
depth of sulphuric acid in a glass for a few days. 
At the end of that time the liquid will be found to be 
notably augmented in volume: instead of one fin- 
ger’s depth there may be two. This increase is due 
to the fact that the sulphuric acid has attracted and 
incorporated moisture from the surrounding atmos- 
phere. Of course, in the process of gaining volume 
by taking on water, the acid also becomes weaker. 
Consequently, if sulphuric acid is to preserve its 
strength it should be kept in a tightly corked bottle. 
‘‘rom this affinity for water comes one of the 
most remarkable properties of sulphuric acid. All 
animal and vegetable substances are composed 
chiefly of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Well, if 
any animal or vegetable substance comes in contact
-P-A-G-E-364
3856 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
with sulphuric acid, the latter promptly seizes upon 
the hydrogen and the oxygen to form water, which 
it appropriates, leaving the carbon by itself exactly 
as if fire had acted upon the substance. Thus all 
animal or vegetable material subjected to the action 
of sulphuric acid is carbonized,—that is to say, re- 
duced to carbon, so that one would think it had 
passed through fire. Here, for instance, is a pine 
chip. I immerse it in sulphuric acid and leave it 
alone a few minutes. You can see the wood turn 
black; it is reduced to carbon, or charcoal. Fire 
could not have done it more quickly. 
‘*But I now come to an experiment that will be of 
even greater interest to you. Into five or six 
thimblefuls of water I put one drop of sulphuric 
acid, and no more. It makes a liquid that is unbear- 
ably sour like lemon juice, though it looks exactly 
like pure water. This perfectly colorless liquid I 
am going to use as writing-ink, very black ink. I 
take a goose-quill and not a steel pen, as the latter 
would be attacked by the acid and might discolor it 
somewhat. My paper is common white paper with- 
out any special preparation. Now watch.’’ 
Uncle Paul tore a piece of paper out of Jules’s 
copy-book, dipped the goose-quill into the mixture 
of water and acid, and wrote something in char- 
acters that remained as invisible as if he had written 
in pure water. As soon as all traces of moisture left 
by the goose-quill had dried up, the paper was 
handed to the children. 
‘‘Read, if you can,’’ said their uncle, ‘‘what I have 
written with my chemical ink.’’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-365
  SULPHUR 357 
The paper was carefully examined in the lght, 
first on one side, then on the other, then upside down, 
and then held against the light; but there was noth- 
ing to be seen, the writing being so completely in- 
visible that it was impossible even to guess where 
the pen had been. 
‘*Your very black ink is not the least black yet,’ 
said Emile, ‘‘I can’t see anything, not the least 
thing, and if I had not seen you writing I should say 
this piece of paper had never been used.”’ 
‘¢Nevertheless,’’ his uncle assured him, ‘‘the in- 
visible is going to become visible. I heat my paper 
by holding it before the fire. Watch what happens.’’ 
At the first touch of heat black characters came 
out on the white background of the paper as if by 
magic. Some appeared suddenly and completely, 
while others came out in separate bits that finally 
joined one another in unbroken lines, so that very 
soon there could be read in letters of a deep black: 
Carbonization by sulphuric acid. 
‘CWonderful!’’ cried Emile, as he watched the 
characters forming as if of their own accord. 
‘‘Wonderful! Let me take your magic ink, Unele, 
please; I want to show it to a friend of mine.’’ 
‘¢You may keep the magic ink. Weakened as it 
is by so much water, the acid is no longer danger- 
ous, even in the hands of a giddy-pate like you. Now 
for the explanation of this writing that so delights 
you. Paper is made of vegetable matter such as old 
rags woven of cotton that has first been spun into 
thread. Hence it contains carbon, hydrogen, and 
oxygen. Acted upon by the heat from a stove or an
-P-A-G-E-366
  358 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
open fire, the trifling amount of sulphuric acid in my 
colorless ink attracts the hydrogen and oxygen at 
the places touched by the pen, turns these two ele- 
ments into water, which it appropriates, and leaves 
the carbon showing plainly in black letters. That 
is the whole secret. What was at first invisible now 
shows in marks of a deep black, because the sulphuric 
acid has laid bare the carbon in the paper. 
‘What I have just shown you is enough, I think, 
to make you understand how dangerous this sul- 
phuriec acid is, turning everything to charcoal as it 
does with as much ease as if, instead of being an acid, 
it were a scorching flame. Whoever handles it 
should do so with the utmost caution. A single 
drop on the clothes is first a red spot and then a hole. 
A drop on the skin is nothing if washed off immedi- 
ately, but would inflict a very painful wound if left 
to take effect. It is the eyes, however, that have the 
most reason to fear this terrible liquid. The least 
splash of it would lead to the most serious conse- 
quences if water were not used at once and in abun- 
dance to wash it away. 
‘‘And yet this perilous stuff is constantly called 
into service in a number of industries. Manufac- 
turers find it of the utmost value. Our woven fab- 
rics, our various kinds of leather and glass and soap, 
our candles, dyestuffs, paper, ink—in fact, a multi- 
tude of manufactured articles in common use—all 
need more or less directly the services of sulphuric 
acid. Ido not mean to say that this acid enters into 
the composition of a yard of percale, for example, or 
a sheet of paper, or a cake of soap. What I mean is 
 
-P-A-G-E-367
    SULPHUR 359 
that its services have been required in the process 
of making this percale, this paper, and this soap. 
Sulphuric acid is a necessity in manufacture, an in- 
strument of the most powerful kind, and one that 
works those transformations without which the 
manufactured article would never have come into 
being. 
‘‘Take glass as an example. It is made by fusing 
sand with carbonate of soda. Nature provides the 
sand all ready for use, but we have to manufacture 
the carbonate of soda. This is done with the help 
of sulphate of soda, which itself is obtained by sub- 
jecting salt to the action of sulphuric acid. Thus, 
while glass itself contains no sulphuric acid, this 
acid is nevertheless needed in the making of glass, 
as without it salt cannot be made to furnish its soda 
to the sand that, uniting with this soda, goes to the 
producing of the glass. A similar part is played by 
sulphuric acid in the making of soap, which contains 
a large proportion of soda. Coal for heating our 
factory furnaces and generating steam for moving 
the factory machinery, and sulphuric acid for work- 
ing important chemical changes—these are two of 
the most potent factors in modern manufacturing in- 
dustry.’’
-P-A-G-E-368
  CHAPTER XXV 
CHLORIN 
£6 E have more than once had occasion to 
speak of salt, common cooking-salt and 
I have told you that it is composed of sodium and 
chlorin, a metal anda metalloid. In the language of 
chemistry, salt is chlorid of sodium.’’ 
‘Are you going to show us some sodium and let 
us see what it looks like?’’ asked Emile, his curiosity 
aroused by the little he had already heard about this 
metal. 
‘‘No, my young friend. Sodium, though not so 
very rare in drug stores, is too expensive a luxury 
for our little village laboratory ; and so we must con- 
tent ourselves with a mere description of it. Imag- 
ine something that shines like freshly cut lead, and 
so soft as to yield to the pressure of one’s fingers. 
In fact, it can be molded like wax. Puta piece of it 
on water and, floating there, it will catch fire and 
spin around all wrapped in flames. Potassium, the 
metal contained in ashes, does the same, only more 
violently. We are now in a position to understand 
why these two metals have this strange peculiarity 
of catching fire as soon as they come into contact 
with water. 
‘‘What is water really made of? Oxygen and 
360 
 
-P-A-G-E-369
  CHLORIN | 361 
hydrogen. Ever since our visit to the blacksmith’s 
shop we have known that red-hot iron decomposes 
water, appropriating its oxygen and releasing its 
hydrogen. Unheated iron and also zine will de- 
compose water in the same way, with no use what- 
ever of fire, if sulphuric acid is added to assist the 
process. Well, potassium and sodium, as well as 
some other substances, notably the metal of lime, or 
calcium, are more active than iron and zine in the 
presence of water. Left to play their part unas- 
sisted, without heat and without the help of sulphurie 
acid or anything else, they decompose the water, 
take to themselves its oxygen, thus becoming oxids, 
and release the hydrogen. Now, it is this uniting 
of the oxygen with the metal, this combustion, that 
develops heat sufficient to set the freed hydrogen on 
fire; and that explains the flames enwrapping the 
metal as it spins around on the surface of the water. 
When the flames die down, the potassium or sodium 
has disappeared, without leaving the slightest visible 
trace behind; but the water in which the oxid of the 
metal was dissolved has now a burning taste and an 
* odor of lye; moreover, it will restore the blue color 
to litmus previously turned red by an acid. 
‘‘Tf T have no sodium to show-you, I can at least 
let you see the element with which it is joined in’ 
partnership in our common salt: I can show you 
chlorin, which is of more importance than sodium. 
To obtain chlorin from salt, use is made of sulphuric 
acid, that powerful agent employed in so many 
operations in the domain of chemistry. In the pres- 
ent instance the acid’s part is to appropriate the 
 
-P-A-G-E-370
362 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
metal and thus set the chlorin free. But in order 
to combine with the acid, the sodium must first be 
converted into an oxid, into soda; and for this, oxy- 
gen is required. The duty of supplying this oxy- 
gen is assigned to dioxid of manganese, that same 
black powder we used in obtaining oxygen from a 
salt. Its function then was to regulate the heat 
throughout the mass of salt and thus make easier the 
decomposition of the latter. Now, however, its pur- 
pose is quite different: itself very rich in oxygen, its 
office is to give up some of this to the sodium, which 
will thus become soda; and this in turn will then 
combine with the sulphuric acid to form sulphate of 
soda. These combinations being effected, the chlo- 
rin will be left in a free state, no longer fettered by 
the bonds hitherto uniting it with the metal sodium. 
‘‘The apparatus for this operation is the same ag 
that used in obtaining oxygen. Into our glass bal- 
loon I put a handful of common salt and the same 
amount of dioxide of manganese. I mix them well 
and sprinkle freely with sulphuric acid. Then, with 
its tube attached, the balloon is set in place over the 
brazier so as to receive the heat from the few live 
coals the brazier contains. A very gentle heat is 
enough, the release of chlorin beginning even before 
the temperature has risen at all. Chlorin is a gas 
heavier than air, and so we will collect it as we 
collected our carbonic-acid gas; that is, we will ar- 
range the tube from the balloon in such a manner 
that it will reach to the bottom of our wide-mouthed 
bottle or jar in which we propose to store the chlorin. 
‘‘Up to this point we have had to do only with in- 
 
-P-A-G-E-371
  CHLORIN 363 
visible gases. Air, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, car- 
bonic-acid gas, and carbon monoxid are gases that 
not even the sharpest eyes can see; and most other 
gases are of like character in this respect, so that 
gases as a class are thought of by us as invisible. 
Now, however, we have a gas that is as subtle and 
impalpable as the others and yet can be seen very 
well. It owes its visibility to its pale greenish- 
yellow tinge. Its name, chlorin, which comes from 
a Greek word meaning green, takes note of this 
quality. 
‘*Because of this slight color possessed by chlorin 
we can watch the gas as it accumulates in the bottom 
of the jar, where it is held by its weight, and where, 
also, it displaces the air previously occupying the 
Same space but now driven out by reason of its 
lesser weight. See there! In the bottom of the jar 
there appears a kind of fine yellowish vapor, the 
layer increasing in thickness little by little and fill- 
ing more and more of the jar from the bottom 
upward. That yellowish vapor is chlorin; what is 
above it, colorless and invisible, is air. Wait a few 
minutes and the visible layer will reach the neck; 
the jar will then be full of chlorin.’’ 
As soon as it was full, the jar was covered with a 
piece of glass and a second jar filled in the same man- 
ner. But during the operation a little of the gas 
had escaped into the room, perhaps allowed to do so 
by Uncle Paul in order to teach his pupils how dis- 
agreeable chlorin is to breathe. Emile in particular 
learned the lesson so as never to forget it. Happen- 
ing to be near the apparatus just when the empty 
 
-P-A-G-E-372
  364 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
jar was substituted for the full one, he received a 
whiff of the offensive gas in his nostrils, whereupon 
he was seized with a fit of coughing such as no cold 
or whooping-cough had ever caused him. And so 
our giddy-pate coughed and spat and spat and 
coughed, but all in vain, in his effort to get rid of 
what was choking him. It needed his uncle’s re- 
assurance to calm his fears as to the consequences of 
this accident. 
‘*It is nothing, my young friend; you ’Il get over 
your coughing in a few minutes. It was the chlorin 
that started it, but luckily only a very little of it 
reached you, and that little was mixed with a good 
deal of air, so that you smelt the terrible gas more 
than you swallowed it. Drink a glass of cold water, 
and that will help to clear your throat.’’ 
The cough did in fact soon subside, and the misad- 
venture had no other consequence than to make its 
victim rather more cautious thereafter about ventur- 
ing near the jars of chlorin. 
‘‘Now you are over-cautious, my child,’’ said his 
uncle. ‘‘A slight smell of chlorin is nothing to be 
afraid of; it may even be rather wholesome, espe- 
cially when the air is foul with the products of 
decay. What is to be feared is breathing this gas 
pure and admitting it into the lungs in some con- 
siderable quantity. Whoever should fill his chest 
with it, as we fill our chests with atmospheric air, 
would die in fearful agony after a few breaths.’’ 
‘*T should think as much,’’ declared Emile, ‘‘after 
the fit of coughing I got from just a whiff of it. 
But how queer it is that common salt should be 
 
-P-A-G-E-373
  CHLORIN 365 
made of chlorin that suffocates us and sodium that 
would burn out our mouths if we took the least bite 
of it! It’s lucky those two fearful substances 
change so much when they come together, or I should 
never again dare to salt a radish before eating it.’’ 
‘‘Tt is lucky, too,’’ continued his unele, ‘‘that as 
soon as it is separated from sodium chlorin regains 
its energetic properties, for manufacturers profit 
greatly by these in certain branches of their industry. 
We will, however, confine ourselves to the one chief 
use that is made of chlorin, which is in bleaching. | 
Into this jar filled with chlorin I pour some writing- 
_ ink from your inkstand there. I shake the jar to 
make the gas act on the liquid, and in a trice the 
thing is done. The ink, which was at first of a deep 
black, has turned to a pale yellow and now looks 
like slightly muddy water. The liquid so strongly 
colored at the start is left with hardly any color, 
the chlorin having destroyed the black of the ink. 
‘¢ Another way to show the same thing will interest 
you even more. Here is a sheet of paper written 
on with ordinary ink, a sheet taken from one of 
your old copy-books. I moisten it with water to 
hasten the chemical action of the gas, and put it into 
our second jar of chlorin. Is it not marvelous to see 
what now follows? The written characters fade 
away rapidly, and the paper is left as white as it 
ever was. I take the paper out of the jar so that 
you may examine it more closely. Look at it well 
and tell me whether you can see any trace of the 
writing that was on it.’’ 
The boys gave the sheet of paper the closest

scrutiny, but could not distinguish a single letter. 
The paper looked as if it had never been used, and 
the utmost they could make out was an occasional 
scratch of the pen where it had pressed very hard. 
‘<The writing has all disappeared,’’ declared Jules, 
‘fand the paper is as good as new. Would sulphur 
gas do that? It turns violets and roses white.’’ 
‘*No, it would have no effect. Sulphur is too weak 
a bleacher. In many eases it is without effect, and 
here too it would be powerless. Chlorin, on the con- 
trary, has so great a bleaching power that few dye- 
\\. stuffs can withstand it. In this respect it is the 
most useful agent known to the industrial arts. 
jected to the action of chlorin, as a third experiment 
will prove to you. I take a leaf of an old book of 
no value and write on it with ordinary ink, even 
smearing it with blots like a child that does not 
know how to handle a pen. When the ink is dry, 
I moisten the page a little and put it into the chlorin. 
My writing and my ink-blots vanish as by magic, 
but the print remains as black as ever. The page is 
now as clean as when first leaving the hands of the 
printer. The marks I made with writing-ink have 
been removed, but the printed words have lost noth- 
ing of their clearness: they stand out very black 
against the white background of the paper. The 
ink-stained and illegible page has been so trans- 
formed by the chlorin that it now looks like a leaf 
from a new book.’’ 
‘‘But why is it,’’ asked Jules, ‘‘that the printing- 
 
-P-A-G-E-375
         CHLORIN 367 
ink stays as it was while the writing-ink is all 
bleached out?’’ 
‘‘That is because the two inks are made of differ- 
ent materials. Printers’ ink is made of lampblack 
and linseed oil. Lampblack is a form of carbon and 
hence a simple substance, an element, and not some- 
thing that can be decomposed. Now, chlorin acts on 
dyestuffs by decomposing them and then combining 
with one of their elements, hydrogen. Lampblack, 
which is carbon and nothing more, cannot be decom- 
posed; it cannot give to the chlorin any hydrogen, 
because it has none to give; hence it remains lamp- 
black and thus keeps its black color. Not so with 
writing-ink, however: that contains various ingredi- 
ents, being usually made of sulphate of iron, gall- 
nuts, and logwood. The two latter belong to the 
vegetable kingdom and contain hydrogen, which the 
chlorin seizes; and, one of the elements being thus 
removed, the color disappears. 
‘‘The principal use of chlorin as a bleacher is in 
the manufacture of woven fabrics and of paper. 
The perfect whiteness of our linen and our writing- 
paper we owe to chlorin; and so it comes about that 
before we can have any white paper for writing or 
printing, or any white cotton or linen for making 
shirts, handkerchiefs, curtains, and other articles, 
as well as for making gaily colored calico, we have 
to call in the services of salt,—or, rather, of that 
element in salt that we obtain with the help of sul- 
phurie acid and then use as a bleaching agent. 
There you have an example, to add to the many / ae:
-P-A-G-E-376
  368 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
other examples, of the important part sulphuric acid 
plays in our manufactures. 
‘“The natural color of hemp and linen is a light 
reddish, and so fixed is it that it disappears only 
after repeated washings; hence, the longer a piece 
of linen has been used and the more times it has 
passed through the laundry, the whiter and softer 
it is. To give to linen the utmost possible white- 
ness, we spread it out on a closely mown meadow 
and leave it there for weeks at a time, exposed to 
the sunlight by day and to dampness by night. 
This prolonged exposure to sun and air, with alter- 
nate moistening and drying, finally weakens the hold 
of the reddish color so that subsequent washings 
gradually remove it entirely. 
‘‘But this method of bleaching is very slow, and 
when it is applied to great quantities of cloth and 
over long periods of time, it is also very costly, 
because it withholds a considerable area of land 
from productive use. Consequently, in factories 
where linen and hemp and especially cotton goods 
are made, a more powerful and less dilatory bleach- 
ing agent than sun and dew is called into service; 
and this agent is chlorin, whose speedy effect on ink 
you have just seen. Evidently a gas that can take 
out so black a color as that of ink, and do it so 
quickly, can easily remove the faint reddish tinge 
marring the whiteness of hemp, linen, and cotton.’’ 
‘“Wool and silk, too,’’ suggested Jules, ‘‘could be 
bleached with chlorin, and that would be a much 
quicker way than with burning sulphur.”’ 
‘But no one except a bungler would for a moment
-P-A-G-E-377
  CHLORIN 369 
think of trying it,’’ replied his uncle. ‘‘This gas 
would attack wool and silk and soon reduce them 
to a mere pulp.’’ 
‘‘But you say cotton, linen, and hemp can stand 
it? 
‘Yes, but their resistance to the action of drugs 
has no parallel,—a fact that gives them inestimable 
value. Just think of the many uses we make of linen 
and cotton and hemp fabrics, and what rough han- 
dling they receive,—repeated washing with corrosive 
lye and the strongest soap, rubbing and beating, and 
exposure to sun, air, and rain. What sort of ma- 
terial, then, is this that withstands the harsh treat- 
ment of washing with soap and of exposure to sun 
and weather, that remains intact even when all 
around it is decay, and that defies the manufactur- 
ers’ powerful drugs and emerges from all these tests 
whiter and more supple than before? This almost 
indestructible material is the vegetable fiber of the 
plants known to us as hemp, flax, and cotton, a fiber 
unrivaled in its kind. Chlorin, which leaves textiles 
made of this fiber uninjured, while at the same time 
bleaching them to an exquisite whiteness, destroys 
all fabrics made of animal fiber, such as woolen 
cloth from the sheep’s fleece and silk goods from 
the silkworm’s cocoon. 
‘*So common is the use made of chlorin as a 
bleaching agent that there are many factories de- 
voted solely to its preparation. ‘To make it portable 
and convenient for use we store it up, as we might 
say, in lime, which absorbs it freely. This com- 
pound is a white powder like lime itself, with a very
-P-A-G-E-378
370 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
strong and penetrating odor. It is called chlorid 
of lime and is a veritable storehouse of chlorin; and 
it is this that is commonly used whenever a powerful 
bleaching agent is needed. 
‘“Now I must tell you about the part played by 
chlorin in paper-making. We commit our thoughts 
to writing without reflection on the many processes 
necessary to produce the white paper on which we 
write. Thousands of years ago the Assyrians of 
Babylon and Nineveh wrote with a sharp-pointed 
style on an unhardened clay brick, which was then 
baked in an oven to fix the writing for all time. 
If any one wished to send a letter to a friend, it took 
the form of a brick similar in weight and size to 
those we use to-day for building.’’ 
‘‘With a load of letters like that,’’ said Emile, 
‘‘postmen to-day would be so weighed down they 
could n’t stagger along.’’ 
‘‘Tf it was desired to write a book,’’ resumed his 
uncle, ‘‘for after ages to read,—a history of the 
memorable events of the time, for instance,—the 
work occupied whole shelves of a library, each page 
of the history being represented by one of these 
baked bricks. A single one of our printed volumes 
would have required in the writing enough bricks 
to build a house. You can judge from that how 
comparatively small must have been the amount 
of reading-matter in even a large library of those 
remote times, when each leaf was so bulky and cum- 
bersome. A few remains of those ancient brick 
books have come down to us, having been dug up 
on the sites of Nineveh and Babylon; and these 
 
-P-A-G-E-379
  CHLORIN 371 
literary remains have even been deciphered and 
translated. 
‘Much later, another method of writing, no less 
strange in our eyes, came into use in those same 
regions of the East. A reed cut to a pen-point was 
the writing-instrument, and a black liquid made of 
soot stirred up in vinegar was the ink, while the 
paper was a bone, the broad flat shoulder-blade of a 
sheep, bleached by long exposure to the weather. 
A packet of writing on one subject—a book, in short 
—was made up of a number of these bones all tied 
together with a string. 
‘Tn the Europe of long ago, particularly in Greece 
and Rome, where civilization was most advanced, it 
was customary to use wooden tablets coated with 
a thin layer of wax, on which one wrote with a 
pointed instrument, a style, sharp at one end and 
having a wide flat head at the other. The pointed 
end was used for tracing the characters in the wax, 
the flat end for erasing them and for smoothing the 
soft surface for fresh writing. 
‘‘Of all ancient peoples, the Egyptians came the 
nearest to inventing something like the paper of 
modern times. On the banks of the Nile there grows 
in abundance a kind of reed called papyrus, whose 
outer covering peels off in long strips, thin and 
white. These strips were soaked in the muddy 
water of the river, which served as glue, and were 
then arranged side by side, with a similar layer over 
them, but running crosswise. Pressed flat and 
beaten with a hammer, the whole made a sheet suit- 
able to write on. Here again the pen was a pointed 
 
-P-A-G-E-380
372 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
reed and the ink the same liquid prepared from soot. 
I’'rom the word ‘papyrus’ we get our word ‘paper.’ 
‘‘Papyrus sheets were not cut into small oblong 
pieces with square corners, such as we are so fa- 
miliar with, but were made each in one continuous 
strip, its length varying with the amount of writing 
to be received. Hence, a papyrus book was all in one 
sheet or strip, which, for convenience in handling, 
was rolled around a little wooden cylinder to which 
the end of it was fastened. When we read a book 
we turn the leaves one by one, and these leaves 
have printing on both sides. The ancients followed 
a different method: they unrolled little by little the 
long strip of papyrus containing writing on only 
one side. 
‘‘The invention of paper is attributed to the 
Chinese. In the ninth century the Arabs introduced 
its manufacture in the nearer East, but its use did 
not become general in Europe until the thirteenth 
century. About the year thirteen hundred and 
forty the first paper factories were established in 
France. Paper such as you have in the fair white 
leaves of your copy-books, and such as is used in 
making our more costly printed books, comes from 
the despised contents of the ragbag. Shreds and 
tatters are collected, some being taken out of the 
mud in the street, and some bearing the marks of 
unspeakable filth. They are sorted out, the better 
ones for fine paper, the inferior for coarse. After 
receiving a vigorous and much-needed washing, they 
are shredded until the woven fabric is reduced to 
lint, this process being the work of a eylinder 
 
-P-A-G-E-381
  CHLORIN 373 
equipped with sharp blades and revolving in a 
trough containing the rags soaking in water. Thus 
torn to bits, the rags are at last reduced to a sort 
of pulp or semi-liquid paste, which is gray in color 
and has to be thoroughly bleached before it can 
become the perfectly white paper so familiar to us. 
This bleaching is done by adding to the pulp, while 
the cylinder is still in motion, a weak solution of 
chlorin furnished by the chlorid of lime already 
mentioned. That is the office of chlorin in paper- 
manufacture, the bleaching of the rag-pulp to a 
spotless whiteness. 
‘‘But before paper can serve for writing on, it 
must be prepared in such a way that ink will not 
soak into it and spread in all directions, thus making 
the written characters illegible. To this end the 
pulp or paste receives a certain amount of what is 
known as size, made of resin and starch. If, how- 
ever, the paper is intended for use in printing, this 
preparation is unnecessary; and that is why the 
paper of our books absorbs ink so freely if we try 
to write on it. 
‘‘The rag-pulp, bleached by chlorin and treated 
with resin and starch, is now ready for the final 
- operation. With its bits of thread crisscrossing in 
all directions, it will presently come forth in a thin 
sheet that will be paper. A machine too com- 
plicated to be described here accomplishes this final 
part of ‘the process. The paste runs in a continu- 
ous film over a fine wire netting, which retains the 
coarser particles and lets the finer pass through. A 
second and still finer wire netting, moving on rollers, 
 
-P-A-G-E-382
    374 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
receives what falls from the first, retains the pulp, 
and drains off the water, the drainage being 
hastened by a slight side-to-side movement of the 
netting. In this way the rag-pulp is spread out ina 
uniform thin layer. Carried onward by the netting 
on which it is spread, this layer, this undried sheet, 
is brought into contact with a broad woolen belt, 
to which it clings, and by which it is conveyed over 
a hollow cylinder heated within by steam. On this 
cylinder the paper becomes dry and firm, after 
which it is rolled up on a second cylinder in a con- 
tinuous broad strip of indefinite length. A, few 
minutes only are needed to transform the semi- 
liquid pulp in the trough into paper ready for use. 
All that has to be done after this is to cut the strip 
rolled up on the last cylinder into sheets of the de- 
sired size. | 
‘‘In future, whenever you read a printed page 
or write in your copy-book, remember that we owe 
the beautiful whiteness of the paper to chlorin, 
the gas made from our common salt.’’

      CHAPTER XXVI 
NITROGEN COMPOUNDS 
66 N the damp walls of cellars, wine-vaults, and 
similar places, there is often to be seen a 
sort of fine white fluff resembling the most delicate 
down. One might imagine the stone to be covered 
with a soft fleece. We have already spoken of this 
curious coating, and Jules has told us how by brush- 
ing a damp wall with a feather he has collected 
some of this material, which, on being thrown on 
to live coals, has straightway caused a brilliant 
burst of flame. Its common name is saltpeter, which 
means salt of stone or salt of rock, because it is on 
the surface of stones in our buildings or of the rock 
in caves and underground vaults that this saline 
matter is found. Chemistry calls it ‘nitrate of 
potash,’ a name indicating that it is composed of 
nitric acid and potash. It is a storehouse of easily 
obtainable oxygen, which explains why, on being 
thrown on to live coals, saltpeter makes the coals 
burst at once into flames. It is the oxygen set free 
from the saltpeter that produces this result. 
‘‘Man is able to make, by going the right way 
about it—that is, by bringing together the necessary 
elements—sulphuric acid, sulphurous acid, carbonic 
acid, phosphoric acid, and many other acids. Burn 
375
-P-A-G-E-384
  376 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
sulphur, carbon, phosphorus, and there you have, 
immediately, the last three acids. Sulphuric acid 
is harder to make, calling for a far more elaborate 
process than simple combustion. Nevertheless it is 
made, and in great quantities, too. But nitric acid 
is quite a different matter: its formation is so hard 
to bring about that chemists have not yet succeeded 
in obtaining it by any direct combination of oxygen 
with nitrogen, the reason for this being the very 
slight propensity possessed by nitrogen for com- 
bining with other elements. It is an inert gas, an 
inactive element, rebelling against any sort of 
chemical combination. We have plain proof of this 
in what takes place every day in our furnaces and 
stoves and grates. Through the burning fuel, where 
the temperature is very high, there is constantly 
flowing a stream of atmospheric air, a mixture of 
oxygen and nitrogen; yet, despite the great heat, 
this latter gas does not burn, does not combine with 
its companion, oxygen, but comes out of the fire the 
Same as when it went in. In short, it is incapable 
of combustion in the ordinary sense of that word. 
‘However, what neither chemical skill nor the 
heat of our furnaces can do, nature accomplishes 
slowly, noiselessly, without any use of fire, by subtle 
processes that elude our observation. In the porous 
substance of a damp stone, the combination of nitro- 
gen with oxygen is brought about, resulting in 
nitric acid, which finds a little potassium in the 
stone wall, and so unites with it to make saltpeter. 
It is to this saltpeter on stone walls and elsewhere 
that we go for our nitric acid. The method is very 
. 
5 ~- 
 
-P-A-G-E-385
  NITROGEN COMPOUNDS 377 
simple: all we have to do is to drive the nitric acid 
out of this compound with a stronger acid. Here 
the same brutal law prevails as with carbonic-acid 
gas. ‘Get out of here and make room for me,’ says 
the stronger intruder. Sulphuric acid, the indis- 
pensable aid in most of these chemical changes, is 
made to accomplish this displacement. It is added 
to the saltpeter, and the whole is then heated. Dis- 
lodged from its place, the nitric acid escapes as a 
eas and is collected in a cold receiver, where it 
condenses as a liquid. 
‘“Now we have obtained nitric acid, so that here 
we have, chemically united, the two gases (oxygen 
and nitrogen) that in a merely mechanical mixture 
constitute the air we breathe. If you were not 
already well aware of the enormous difference be- 
tween mere mixture and chemical combination, you 
would here have a striking example of that differ- 
ence. The air we breathe and the terrible acid ioe 
furnished by saltpeter have as constituents the same 
two elements. I say ‘terrible acid,’ and the adjec-L~ 
tive is deserved. Nitric acid is, in fact, so extremely 
violent in its effects that to denote its potent quali- 
ties we often speak of it as aqua fortis (strong 
water). One drop of it on the skin instantly pro- 
duces a yellow spot, and the result is that the af- 
fected skin is burned through and falls off as a 
dead scale. If the acid is kept in a corked bottle, 
it speedily corrodes the cork and reduces it to a 
yellow pulp. 
‘‘Metals themselves, even the hardest of them, 
are eaten by nitric acid. This liquid is a veritable 
 
-P-A-G-E-386
  378 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
storehouse of oxygen, containing quantities of it and 
yielding it very freely. Hence, it corrodes or burns 
most substances that it touches. With its abundant 
oxygen it causes a sort of combustion, with results 
that are sometimes the same as those of ordinary 
combustion. No fire is seen, no flames burst forth, 
and yet there is really what amounts to combus- 
tion, since there is a combination of oxygen with 
the substance attacked, and this combination is at- 
tended by a marked rise in temperature. 
‘‘Let us take some examples of this corrosion of 
metals. I pour a little nitric acid on some iron 
filings. A dense red vapor immediately rises, while 
there is a very audible sound and the mixture be- 
comes heated. In a few moments the iron is com- 
pletely burnt up, turned to rust. I apply the same 
treatment to this tinfoil, which was wrapped around 
a cake of chololate, and the same red vapor rises, 
the same noise is heard, the same increase of tem- 
perature is felt. The tin is turned to a white pulp. 
It is now burnt tin, rusted tin, oxid of tin. I repeat 
the experiment with copper, and the same results 
follow, except that the copper-rust is dissolved in 
the acid as fast as it forms, and produces a green- 
ish-blue liquid. But there are some metals that 
remain unaffected by nitric acid, and of this number 
is gold, which never rusts. Here is a piece of gold- 
leaf such as is used for gilding, and so thin that the 
slightest breath of air will waft it away. Well, 
this delicate gold-leaf stays in the acid without 
showing any effect whatever. It keeps its luster, 
and will always keep it. Gold does not corrode 
 
-P-A-G-E-387
  NITROGEN COMPOUNDS 379 
even if the acid is heated to the boiling-point. I will 
say in passing that this is the test applied by gold- 
smiths to distinguish the precious metal from 
copper, which it so nearly resembles in appearance. 
Copper is eaten by nitric acid, whereas gold re- 
mains unaffected. 
‘‘Metal-engravers turn this property of nitric 
acid to account. When they wish to engrave a 
copper plate, for example, they first overlay it with | 
an impermeable coating, using melted wax for this 
purpose. On this coating they then trace the design 
to be reproduced, and with a fine-pointed instrument 
remove the wax so as to lay bare the metal wherever 
they wish it to be eaten away. After this they pour 
weak nitric acid on the plate thus prepared. 
Wherever the copper is protected by the wax coat- 
ing, no effect is produced, but where it is exposed 
the acid plows a furrow. As soon as the acid is 
thought to have done its work, the layer of wax is 
removed and the design is found reproduced in the 
lines eut into the metal by the corrosive acid. 
‘¢So much for nitric acid. Now let us briefly con- 
sider its compound called saltpeter or nitrate of f 
potassium. This is used chiefly in the manufacture 
of gunpowder, which is made by mixing well to- — 
gether, in the right proportions, sulphur, carbon, 
and saltpeter. So you see there are in gunpowder 
two highly inflammable substances, sulphur and 
carbon, together with a third substance, saltpeter, 
which furnishes an abundant supply of oxygen when 
it decomposes. Consequently, as soon as gunpow- 
der is set fire to, the saltpeter gives off oxygen
-P-A-G-E-388
380 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
freely, and this burns the sulphur and the carbon, 
which thus become suddenly converted into gas. 
The amount of gas so generated is enormous. If 
left free to expand to its full volume, it would occupy 
one hundred and fifty times the space filled by the 
gunpowder producing it. Confined, then, to a space 
much too small for it, this gas makes a vigorous 
effort to free itself, pushing out of its way with 
great violence the bullet or ball or anything else 
that blocks its path, just as a spring forcibly pressed 
down exerts a powerful thrust on whatever holds it 
in that position. 
‘“We must now make the acquaintance of another 
nitrogen compound, one of the utmost importance, 
especially in agriculture. In this bottle is a liquid 
that looks exactly like water. I should not, however, 
advise you to put the open mouth of the bottle to 
your nose, as your sense of smell would be too pain- 
fully affected; but take the slightly moistened cork 
and give it a cautious sniff. Now what can you 
tell me about it?’’ 
“*Pfui!l’’ cried Emile after smelling of the stopper 
with the utmost circumspection, so suspicious was 
he of all chemical odors since his experience with 
the chlorin. ‘‘My, how that smarts! It gets up 
your nose and makes it feel as if it were pricked 
with a lot of sharp little needles.’’ And he rubbed 
his eyes, in which the tears were gathering, though 
he felt not the slightest inclination to cry. He 
passed the cork to Jules, who at once recognized 
the liquid by its smell. 
‘‘Why, that must be ammonia,’’ he declared. 
 
-P-A-G-E-389
  NITROGEN COMPOUNDS 381 
‘Tt ’s what the tailor was using the other day to . 
take out a grease-spot and clean the collar of an 
old coat. I knew it as soon as I smelt it. Besides, 
this stuff makes the tears start, and that’s just 
what the tailor’s ammonia did when I got too near 
it. It was in a cup mixed with water. For a 
minute or two my eyes were all red and full of 
tears.’’ 
‘‘You are quite right,’’ replied his uncle. ‘‘It is 
indeed ammonia I am showing you in this bottle. It 
/ ‘is also called ‘ volatile alkali ’ and ‘ spirits of harts- 
horn,’ but ‘ammonia’ is the usual name. A useful 
property it possesses is that of uniting with grease ) 
and making a soluble combination that can be re- 
moved by washing. That is why we use it in clean- 
ing garments spotted with grease. With a small 
stiff brush we first rub diluted ammonia into the 
soiled places, after which a simple washing with 
ordinary water will take out the grease. That is 
what you saw the tailor doing. 
‘Tn its composition this cleansing liquid is water 
containing in solution a large amount of a peculiar 
gas called ammonia gas. This solution is liquid 
ammonia or volatile alkali or spirits of hartshorn, 
its active ingredient being the gas I have just re- 
ferred to.’’ 
‘Then liquid ammonia and ammonia gas are two 
different things?’’ asked Jules. 
‘*Yes, they are different from each other. Am- 
monia gas is an invisible, colorless gas that stings 
the nose smartly and draws tears; but when we ° 
speak simply of ammonia we commonly mean the 
 
-P-A-G-E-390
  382 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
liquid preparation, made by dissolving a great quan- 
tity of this same gas in water, to which it imparts 
its peculiar properties. What I am showing you in 
this bottle is water in which is stored up an enorm- 
ous volume of ammonia gas. I say an enormous 
volume, for in one liter of water there are more 
than six hundred liters of ammonia gas, the two 
making together about one liter of liquid. From 
this well-filled storehouse there is a gradual escape 
of gas, and that is what has so strong a smell and 
makes tears come into the eyes. If the gas escaped 
rapidly, as it would if we heated the liquid, it would 
overpower us with its pungent odor.’’ 
‘¢And it would make us all ery our eyes out, even 
though we might wish to laugh instead,’’ added 
Hmile. ‘‘Chlorin is the gas that makes us cough, 
ammonia the gas that makes us ery. Hach one has 
a trick of its own.”’ 
. “That is well said,’? his uncle agreed. ‘‘Am- 
monia acts strongly on the eyes, making them red 
and filling them with tears. This peculiarity, to- 
gether with the pungent odor, enables us easily to 
detect the presence of this gaseous compound. 
‘‘To obtain ammonia gas, we heat to redness cer-” 
tain animal substances of little value, such as old 
woolen rags, hair, bones, and scraps of leather; 
and among the gaseous products of the resulting de- 
composition is the gas we are after. It is collected 
by simply dissolving it in water. The process of 
getting illuminating-gas from coal also gives am- 
monia. The water through which the crude coal 
gas is passed in order to purify it arrests this other 
 
-P-A-G-E-391
  NITROGEN COMPOUNDS 383 
gas in its passage, and finally becomes abundantly 
charged with it. | 
‘‘Ammonia gas is composed of nitrogen and hy- 
drogen. On account of nitrogen’s disinclination to 
combine with other elements, any direct union of the 
two gases so as to produce this compound is as 
difficult as is the direct production of nitric acid. 
Chemical science is still unable to make ammonia 
gas in this direct way, and it is doubtful if it will 
ever be able to make it thus in any large quantities. 
This inability is much to be regretted from the 
farmer’s point of view, for ammonia, which to you 
is merely a good cleaner of soiled clothing, plays 
a most important part in our fields and gardens, 
contributing greatly, in the crops it helps to pro- 
duce, to our daily bread. All forms of life, vege- 
table as well as animal, contain nitrogen. When 
they die they give back their elements to the inani- 
mate world by decaying. Their carbon is dispersed 
in ecarbonic-acid gas, their hydrogen in water, and 
their nitrogen in ammonia. But all these products 
of decay are taken up again by vegetation, the car- 
bonic-acid gas giving carbon, water yielding hydro- 
gen, and ammonia gas supplying nitrogen, while 
oxygen is everywhere present. Out of these four 
elements thus assembled by the plant, is built up 
the substance of our bread, our vegetables, our 
fruit of all kinds. Refashioned by the animal, which 
finds it in the plant, this same material becomes 
flesh, milk, fleece, or some other useful product. 
In short, nitrogen, in order to reach the animal, 
must pass through the plant; and in order to reach 
3 7 344 C5 
 
-P-A-G-E-392
  384 THE WONDER BOOK OF CHEMISTRY 
the plant, the world of lifeless matter must supply 
it in the combination known as ammonia. We see 
now why barnyard manure, which is so rich a source 
of ammonia, is so valuable a fertilizer in agricul- 
ture. 
‘‘A few words more on ammonia gas dissolved in ~ 
water: This solution, this liquid ammonia or vola- 
tile alkali, is a colorless fluid of the same penetrating . 
odor as the gas itself. It has a burning taste like 
that of lime and potash; and the resemblance goes 
even farther, for ammonia has the peculiarity of 
restoring its original blue color to litmus reddened 
by an acid. Potash, soda, or lime could not bring 
back the blue color better or more promptly. We 
have seen lime turn violets and other blue flowers 
green. Ammonia, too, turns them green, whether 
from their natural color or after they have been red- 
dened by an acid. 
‘‘The uses of ammonia are numerous. We have 
spoken of it as a cleanser where grease-spots are to 
be removed; but it should be added that it will also 
act on the coloring matter in our garments, chang- 
ing delicate shades. Hence, it should be used only 
on material of dark and fast colors that resist the 
action of this potent cleanser. And here let me tell 
you something that may be useful to you some day. - 
Those who are engaged in chemical experiments 
often spill acid on their clothing. Dark-colored 
cloth is usually turned red by an acid; but a drop 
of ammonia on the red spot will make it disappear, 
restoring very nearly the original color. 
‘‘Ammonia is also used to counteract the effects 
 
-P-A-G-E-393
  NITROGEN COMPOUNDS 385 
of a venomous sting, such as that of a scorpion, 
wasp, or bee, or even to prevent the more serious 
consequences of a viper’s bite. Into the little wound 
a drop of ammonia is poured, and if this is done 
promptly enough it usually forestalls the action of 
the venom. 
‘‘F'inally, ammonia, as it is found in various salts, 
is a most important food for all plants and vege- 
tables, giving them nitrogen as it does so abun- 
dantly. Hence its great value in agriculture; and 
since manure in the process of decay gives out 
ammonia gas very freely, it is plain that this dress- 
ing must be very beneficial to land under cultiva- 
tion. But nowadays there is a great demand for 
artificial fertilizers containing potash and phos- 
phoric acid as well as ammonia.”’

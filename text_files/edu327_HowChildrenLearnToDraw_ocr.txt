  PREFACE 
Some of the recent helpful contributions to the 
subject of teaching drawing have been in the form of 
theories as to what ought to be accomplished. Others 
have been in the form of descriptions of the devices 
and methods employed in various places. This book 
brings both of these points of view into close rela- 
tionship, not only by presenting them together in 
the same volume but also by recording the particular 
classroom experiences which formed the basis for the 
theory given and which in turn have been modified 
by that theory. 
It seemed to us that the concreteness of a detailed 
description of the experiments and theory of one 
school would compensate for the necessary limita- 
tions of such a treatment. We hope that the results 
are representative enough to justify us in having 
given to the description of the work of a single insti- 
tution a name so broad in its significance as the title 
of this book. 
Our sincere thanks are due to the instructors in 
the Elementary School whose codperation made pos- 
sible the close relation of drawing with the other sub- . 
jects, and also to Mr. Harry Orrin Gillet, principal of 
the Elementary School, for his concurrent efforts and 
for his helpful suggestions regarding the manuscript.

HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO 
DRAW | 
INTRODUCTION 
The methods of teaching drawing in the Ele- 
‘mentary School of the School of Education in The 
University of Chicago during the past few years 
have been in the nature of an experiment to dis- 
cover how children learn most readily to use drawing 
as a common means of self-expression. 
re uses of drawing have been emphasized : first, 
( its use as a means of intellectual expression which 
differs essentially from verbal language and there- 
fore offers a unique method of analyzing and dealing 
with subjects and showing them in a new light; 
second, its use as a form of esthetic expression, a 
means of developing artistic appreciation, and an 
avenue to the sources of wsthetic enjoyment. 
Any means that appear ultimately to promote 
appreciation and ability in self-expression have been 
given fair trial, however questionable from the tradi- 
tional artistic standpoint they may appear at first 
sight. For example, in building up a vocabulary of 
forms, direct observation has been supplemented by 
1 
 
-P-A-G-E-8
  2 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
some copying and occasionally even by tracing, and 
a few forms have been taught at first by dictation. 
As high a class average has been expected in 
drawing as in any other subject. Methods as system- 
atic as those in other subjects have been employed, 
and unpromising beginnings, even in the upper 
grades, have not been regarded as reasons for dis- 
couragement. Special talent in art has received the 
same consideration as does special talent in mathe- 
matics or in language. Daily records of each step 
followed in dealing with various topics have been 
kept, in order that from time to time the work of 
the children may be studied and modified in the 
light of all the details of procedure. 
This book presents some of these records, selected 
to show representative series of lessons, accompanied 
by explanatory notes and illustrations from the work 
of the children. This description of classroom method 
is followed by a statement of the conclusions reached 
as a result of this experiment, in the form of a theory: 
as to how children learn to dra hile it is the in- 
tention of this book to select and deal specifically with 
only one of the major lines of art instruction in ele- 
mentary schools, namely, pictorial representation, it 
will be noted that design is so intimately involved 
that it is necessarily given almost equal emphasis. 
Most of the methods and materials used are avail 
able for schools everywhere.

  CHAPTER I 
THE ILLUSTRATION OF THEMES 
The illustration of themes occurring in school sub- 
jects other than drawing gives the children experi- 
ence in practically all the phases of drawing which a 
school course needs to include. In the first place, each 
of these subjects constitutes a center which furnishes 
the narrative or subject interest—the definite “some- 
thing to tell” which is necessary for all good draw- 
ing. Secondly, it provides the motive for gathering 
data which shall make these drawings adequate de- 
“scriptions of the subject under consideration. These 
data insure drawings much richer in detail of de- 
seriptive material than would be possible if the 
children drew simply from their imagination. It 
necessitates studying reference material, such as ob- 
jects or pictures, and learning how to represent the 
forms or pictorial effects necessary for full illustra- 
tion of the theme. Thirdly, it gives practice in 
pictorial composition ‘and provides opportunity for 
experimenting with the arrangement and spacing of 
the illustration in a way that contributes at the 
same time to the clearest presentation of the subject 
matter and also to the most pleasing design. This 
3
-P-A-G-E-10
  4 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
involves, in addition to experimentation with various 
space arrangements and a discussion of the different 
effects produced, a study of the best examples of pic- 
torial composition, under conditions which relate them 
immediately and intimately to the child’s efforts to 
make a harmonious design out of his own illustra- 
tion. For example, after the children have worked 
out. such a theme as occupations in agriculture, ac- 
quaintance with the composition of Millet’s pictures 
of workers in the fields offers them definite sugges- 
tions as to improving their own arrangements. 
The teacher encounters the problem of using 
themes as they occur in the regular school program 
and still keeping the integrity of the course in draw- 
ing. The two greatest difficulties are these: First, 
the value of drawing does not lie wholly in its use 
as an accompaniment of other subjects. It has its 
own characteristic realm, which its use in relation to 
other subjects does not entirely cover. The child’s 
progress in drawing is not always best ministered to 
by compelling it to conform to his progress in the 
other school subjects. Second, themes selected from 
the general educational program do not always fur- 
nish the interests most vital to good drawing. These 
two difficulties are worth serious consideration. 
However, facts seem to indicate that the in- 
structor who sees most clearly what grounds the 
drawing should cover, and who has also the most
-P-A-G-E-11
  
THE ILLUSTRATION OF THEMES 5 
comprehensive knowledge of the school work as a 
whole and of the part drawing should have in this 
work, is generally the one who sees in the themes 
supplied by the subject matter of the general cur- 
riculum the best possible opportunity for accomplish- 
ing the specific ends he desires in the drawing. 
With regard to the vitality of the interests fur- 
nished by these school themes, it may be said that 
interest im any subject which continues through 
successive lessons is cumulative. The instructor in 
drawing who. uses school themes for material is able 
to reénforce the particular interest which arises in 
the drawing by taking advantage of the interest 
already awakened in the subject chosen and thus 
to utilize the momentum of both. 
This is not to say that the subject matter of other 
school work should furnish the entire material for 
drawing. Nevertheless, when on the one hand special 
instructors in drawing have a comprehensive knowl- 
edge of the grade work as a whole, and when on the 
other hand the school authorities no longer regard 
drawing as a special subject, the pedagogy of which 
is essentially different in nature from that of other 
subjects, it will be found that (the teaching of drawing 
is vitalized, and that its scope is widened rather than 
narrowed by close alliance with the rest of the school 
program, The following pages describe in detail the 
working out of several school themes. These themes 
   
-P-A-G-E-12
; 6 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
are not in any way intended to show the actual sub- 
jects which should be taken in every school. They 
were selected because they were the themes which 
occurred in connection with the other studies, and are 
described because they offer typical examples and not 
because they are necessarily the best subject matter. | 
THE ILLUSTRATION OF HISTORY 
GRADE I 
Indians   The study of Indian life forms one of the history 
topics in the first grade. Jenks’s “ The Childhood of 
Ji-Shib” is used as a basis for this work. The story 
is told in a simple and dramatic way. The children 
work out many of the activities of Indian life by con- 
structing Indian villages upon the sand table and by 
dramatizing parts of the story. This necessitates a 
close study of the wigwam, canoe, weapons, food, ani- 
mals, etc. Each child makes an “Indian Book,” in 
which he keeps all his written papers and illustra- 
tions. The following points are copied from the 
history outline: 
Drawing: 
(a) Sketches of wigwams, canoes, utensils, etc. 
(0) Free-hand drawings to represent various phases of 
Indian life, as hunting, cooking, ete. 
(c) Working out designs for the cover of the * Indian 
Book.”
-P-A-G-E-13
  THE ILLUSTRATION OF THEMES 7 
This informs the instructor in drawing definitely 
as to what lines of illustration the grade teacher 
thinks will contribute most to the history. The 
work of drawing in relation to this particular his- 
tory topic is here ‘given in full detail, as it was 
actually presented to the class. 
  Fig. 1, A Cuip’s First Skercn or Inpran Lire 
1. After the children had been given Indian stories 
they were told to draw a picture which would show 
some phases of Indian life (Fig. 1). The class then 
had opportunity to see all the sketches together and 
to tall them over. They saw clearly the need for 
better drawing of certain important objects. For ex- 
ample, they saw the need of being able to make a 
better drawing of a canoe. They were then given ~ 
 
-P-A-G-E-14
  8 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
detailed practice with the shape of the canoe. First 
they drew from a small model. It was found that 
they were able to appreciate the shape much better 
if they traced it in the air with a finger, then drew 
it on the board, and lastly on paper. This was fol- 
lowed by free-hand cutting of the canoe shape. As 
a result of this practice, three fourths of the children 
were able to represent the shape fairly well. Those 
who did not get a good shape practiced again and 
again, tracing it in the air and on the board, the 
teacher drawing with them (Fig. 2). The same 
method was followed in studying the shape of the 
wigwam, namely, tracing it in the air and drawing 
it on the board and on paper, with suggestions from 
models and pictures, and then cutting it free-hand 
from paper. 
2. The children made simple pictorial composi- 
tions, using elements which they had just learned; 
namely, the wigwam and the canoe. They now criti- 
cized their first pictures again, this time with regard 
to the position of sky lines and the placing of trees 
and water. They compared their own drawings with 
other pictures, in order to see how skilled artists 
had represented these things. They made particular 
notes regarding the representation of the sky line 
and the placing of trees with regard to the horizon. 
The instructor then made very simple illustrative 
sketches showing the children how to represent

the sky line and water. She did this by draw- 
ing quickly before the class, using the same sort 
of crayons and paper which the children had and 
letting these sketches serve not as copies but as 
illustrations of the process, thus giving the children 
the ‘stimulus of seeing someone actually draw the 
lines which produced the effect. These drawings 
were put into the wastebasket as fast as they were 
made. With the suggestions and the fresh impulse 
thus gained, each child redrew his own picture, put- 
ting in wigwams, canoes, and Indians, as needed. 
For the Indians, skeleton outlines were used, and 
the feather headdress, a feature so characteristic of 
Indians in the mind of the child, was added. Fig. 3 
shows sketches resulting from this step. 
3. It became necessary now, in order to carry out 
the sketches in further detail, that the shapes of cer- 
tain Indian weapons and tools should be learned. 
Actual examples of these weapons and tools were 
available from the school museum. These were 
brought in, and the children drew them, following 
the same method as in the case of the previous ob- 
jects. The weapons were then cut free-hand from 
paper. The following shapes were studied: bow and 
arrow, scraper, knife, ax, hammer, ete. (Fig. 4). 
4. In order to illustrate a particular story it was 
necessary to learn how to draw the papoose. The 
children had pictures and little models of the case

in which the papoose is carried. The essential lines 
which showed the construction of the case were dic- 
tated by the teacher, because it was somewhat more 
complicated than the preceding objects. The children 
were then left, free to decorate it as they chose, using 
  Fic. 6. DrawinG or AN INDIAN Camp 
suggestions gained from the models and illustrations 
(Fig. 5). 
5. At this point the children again made pictures 
illustrating Indian life. These were more elaborate 
than those previously made, because of the increased 
number of objects which they had studied and could 
introduce (Fig. 6). Care was taken to emphasize the 
objects which were of most interest.

6. A simple study of Indian design and pottery 
was then made. Indian baskets and pottery were 
brought into the room from the school museum. The 
children looked these over and selected those designs 
which interested them most and those which they 
found repeated many times. They were then told 
how each design meant something to the Indians, 
and they compared the elements of the Indian de- 
signs with the design units which they themselves 
made from flowers, fish, etc., for borders (see p. 88). 
The teacher then drew on the board certain typical 
forms selected from the Indian designs, for example, 
Fig. 7. The children practiced making these, until 
they could repeat them easily, and then arranged 
them into borders appropriate for use on pottery 
(Fig. 8). They then cut out pottery shapes, folding 
the paper before cutting so that both sides would be 
alike. They decorated these, using several of the 
designs suggested by the actual pottery. Some study 
was then made of the colors used by the Indians on 
their vases, and the children attempted to get colors 
like these, using only red, black, and white. 
7. For somewhat over a week the children spent 
the time devoted to history and to constructive work 
in making Indian designs which they had learned, 
drawing them with colored crayons. Small models 
of the wigwam were constructed, and ornamented 
with Indian designs. Later two or three wigwams

large enough to play in were constructed in the 
school garden by the children. Each child made an 
Indian costume in school and wore it (Fig. 9). They 
also made bows, arrows, etc. During the period of 
this work, trips were taken to the Field Museum, 
   Fig. 9. Inpran Costumes MADE BY THE CHILDREN 
where the children had opportunity to see real 
canoes, wigwams, weapons, costumes, etc.’ 
8. While this work was being done each child 
was constructing a book which contained his Indian 
stories and illustrations. The title “ Indians” was 
placed upon the cover. Indian designs were used in

the decoration of the cover, and also throughout the 
book as decorative units. Each child chose one of 
the forms of Indian design with which the class had

20 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
become familiar during their study and used it as 
his particular decorative unit. Fig. 10 shows one of 
these book covers. 
In these steps of theme study all the art inter- 
ests which appear in this grade have been satisfied. 
There has been the free expression of narrative in- 
terest. There has been the building up of a few clear 
mental images to make narrative expression more 
complete and satisfying and to form the beginnings 
of a usable graphic vocabulary. This study of objects 
has been as thorough and systematic, merely from 
the point of view of the method employed, as would 
have been possible had the drawing been a special 
subject, wholly dissociated from any theme. It has 
involved practice, and the use of both objects and 
pictures as reference material. The increasing skill 
and knowledge have been assimilated at each step by 
continued drawing of picture stories of Indian life. 
There has been algo,a great deal of expression of the 
more purely sthetic interests, in the composition of 
the sketches and in the study and use of elements 
of Indian design. The influence of seeing someone 
draw has also been an important factor. 
The theme has suggested, intensified, and amplified 
the story interest. The cumulative momentum of 
narrative interest has been reénforced by the histor- 
ical interest. The theme has also provided an impor- 
- tant motive for’ studying composition and arriving 
 
-P-A-G-E-27
  THE ILLUSTRATION OF THEMES 21 
at some genuine artistic appreciation, because the 
children are themselves composing pictures. In this 
actual composition the more formal elements of bal- 
ance, rhythm, and harmony tend to appear naturally, 
under the impulse to set forth a definite interest for- 
cibly and beautifully. Added suggestions come be- 
cause the children compare their own drawings with 
good designs and compositions dealing with the same 
subject. The value of any verbal discussion of for- 
mal elements of composition in order to make them 
intellectually appreciated at this age is at best slight. 
Indeed it is a question whether any explicit dis- 
cussion of these elements in elementary schools is 
not a hindrance. These discussions make a popular 
appeal because they present a series of logically defi- 
nite steps in connection with a somewhat elusive sub- 
ject. The definiteness, however, is more in the nature 
of a definiteness of intellectual classification than of 
zsthetic response, and in the case of elementary- 
school pupils does not appear to lead to artistic 
appreciation. In efforts for esthetic education we 
have sometimes tried to substitute the mature intel- 
lectual pleasure of knowing why a thing is excel- 
lent, for the xsthetic pleasure, which may begin at 
an early age, of enjoying it because it is excellent. 
At the close of the study of this theme all the 
associated interests were given concrete and unified ex- 
pression in the Indian books which the children made.

GRADE IT 
A rabs 
An important unit of work in the latter half 
of Grade II is the study of shepherd life. From 
several subjects equally well adapted for illustra- 
tion, this one was selected as a center for the 
theme work in drawing. As a result of the dis- 
cussion of this theme with the children the fol- 
lowing things were chosen to constitute the graphic 
vocabulary which must be built up if the subject 
was to be well illustrated: a camel, the Arab tent, 
the Arab dress, palm trees, and the general con- 
figuration of desert landscape. This preliminary 
discussion as to just what objects will be ‘used. to 
illustrate a given theme accomplishes two ends. 
It defines the minimum scope of the vocabulary, 
listing the things which are absolutely necessary, 
and it gives to teacher and pupils that reasonable 
justification for the special study of these particular 
object which is essential to any vital work. 
Th¢ steps followed in the study of this theme 
are here described. 
1. Learning to draw a Camel. Pictures of camels, 
and a good toy camel, wére placed before the class. 
Each child then drew a camel as best he could, 
with no help from the teacher. These results were 
hung on the front blackboard, and a vote was taken

which indicated the ones that looked most like

that everyone needed to learn the shape of a camel |
-P-A-G-E-30
  24 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
much more definitely. The teacher then drew a 
camel on the board, discussing each line as she 
drew it and having the children first draw it in 
the air as they looked at the model or pictures. 
When this was finished she began again to draw 
the camel, line by line, on the board, but this time 
each child drew the same line on paper. The line 
for the hump was drawn first, then the neck and 
head, then the line under the body, and last of all 
the legs. The children then drew several camels on 
paper and on the board. When all in the class 
seemed to be having difficulty with a certain part 
of the camel, time was taken to practice just that 
line or group of lines, for instance, the line for the 
back, or neck, or head (Fig. 11). The pictures and 
model served as sources of reference by which the 
children continually improved their own drawings. 
By the end of the second half-hour lesson each 
child could draw a fairly good camel. From this 
time on, camels were drawn freely in all sizes and 
positions for illustrative work. 
During this period in which the children were 
drawing camels, one little boy remarked that he 
had taught his grandmother how to draw a camel, 
and then followed similar exclamations from almost 
every child in the class. Some of them had taught 
older brothers and sisters to draw camels, and others 
had attempted to teach the babies in the family. 
 
-P-A-G-E-31
  THE ILLUSTRATION OF THEMES 25 
With other second grades different methods have 
been used in teaching children to draw the camel, 
such as calling attention to the general shape of the 
body first (oval) and adding the parts to this, or 
letting the children learn the shape by practice in 
tracing a hectographed copy. However, it was found 
that these methods took a longer time to secure good 
results and did not bring to the child the sureness 
which came through the method described above, 
namely, by adding line to line and memorizing 
these as they are drawn. 
Experience shows that ability to draw one ae 
well, although it may become necessary to make the 
process of learning thorough even in a mechanical 
sense, is an essential foundation for later spontaneity 
and originality in which any systematic progress 
is evident. In later grades, when an object at all 
similar to the one thus learned is needed, children 
of their own accord will make “such remarks as, 
“T know how to draw that; we drew it [or some- 
thing like it] in the second grade.” 
2. Making a Simple Composition with the Camel. 
After the children had learned how to draw a camel 
each child made as good a drawing as he could. 
Free-hand cuttings of the camel were then made. 
The camel shape was cut by each child from a light- 
brown paper and placed on a page for his book, 
which was of darker brown. He experimented with 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
  26 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
the placing, in order to get the most pleasing 
arrangement within the given space. The resulting 
arrangements were discussed. The cutting was then 
mounted and used as an illustration in the history 
book. One definite item in the necessary graphic 
vocabulary was thus made ready for use, and the 
skill of the children in this particular could be 
depended upon (Fig. 12). 
3. Drawing of Palm Trees. Pictures of several 
different kinds of palm trees were shown to the 
class. Their attention was called especially to the 
date and fan palms. The children traced with their 
fingers in the air the apparent lines. of a palm-tree 
shape. They noted particularly the fact that all the 
leaves grew from the top of the tree. They noted 
also the shape of the trunk. Different children then 
came to the board and showed how they would draw 
a palm tree. The teacher then showed by sketches 
on the board the characteristics of the different kinds 
of palm leaves. The children tried to see if they 
could draw on paper with colored crayons the dif- 
ferent kinds of palms so that each could be recog- 
nized from the drawing. The instructor found at this 
point that the tree shapes which had been learned 
in connection with the Indian work in Grade I 
contributed definitely to the readiness with which 
the children now learned the shape of the palm tree. 
They had a definite tree image with which to
-P-A-G-E-33
  THE ILLUSTRATION OF THEMES 27 
  Vie. 12. Curnp’s StnmovurtTe or CAMEL ON A Page oF us Book 
compare the new shape, and this aided them in 
recognizing its individual characteristics. 
4. Simple Compositions with Palm Trees. The 
children discussed the shape of the paper most 
we,
-P-A-G-E-34
  28 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
appropriate for use in a composition containing 
palm trees as the principal element. They decided 
that since palms were tall trees they would have 
the long dimension of the paper vertical. Quick 
drawings were made on the board by the teacher, 
showing the different effects which were produced 
by placing the horizon line at different distances 
above and below the center of the paper. The chil- 
dren then experimented with different arrangements 
of sky lines, using brown crayons on manila paper. 
The most pleasing of these sketches were afterwards 
mounted on dark-brown paper (Fig. 13). 
5. The Drawing of Arab Tents. As a preliminary 
to learning to draw the Arab tent, the Indian wig- 
wam studied in Grade I was reviewed. Here again, 
as in the case of the trees, the object previously 
learned served to interpret the new form. A num- 
ber of pictures of Arab tents were then shown, and 
the children compared the various shapes of these. 
They traced the shapes in the air and then sketched 
them on the board, introducing the suggestions they 
gained from the pictures and from. descriptions 
obtained from their history work. Fig. 14 shows 
free-hand cuttings of figures learned thus far, grouped 
in a composition. 
6. Composition Work. New compositions were 
now made, introducing, in addition to the palm 
_ trees of the previous compositions, tents, camels,  
-P-A-G-E-35
THE ILLUSTRATION OF THEMES 29 
and whatever other item any child cared to put in. 
The principal elements of these compositions were 
then discussed, the placing of the sky line and the 
  Fig. 13. Composirions INCLUDING PALM TREES IN THE DesERT 
kind of sky line which would be seen in a desert. 
The fact was brought out that the sky line of the 
desert is not always horizontal. The children had 
already made a trip to the great sand dunes on the

shores-of Lake Michigan. During this trip, and 
after they returned, the children had made sketches 
of the dunes. These sketches and the recollections 
of their trip helped the children to interpret the 
desert scenery. From pictures and from their recol- 
lection of the dunes they then made notes of the 
  Fic. 14. Composition MADE BY GROUPING Forms cut FROM Paper 
colors which should enter into a desert scene. They 
then made sketches of the desert with soft colored 
crayons, as illustrations for an original story of Arab 
life which they had written in connection with their 
history work.

event in his own story. The children were then 
asked the following question: If you made a pic- 
ture illustrating this event, what would you need 
to put into your picture? In answer, each child 
made a list on the board of what he would include 
in his picture. In all the compositions made by the 
children, these lists proved of great value in helping 
them to get the general plan of their picture in 
advance and also to decide definitely upon what 
they needed to use. These lists were then ‘discussed, 
and the things common to all or most of them were 
noted, as well as the special things needed in indi- 
vidual cases. The points of composition which had 
previously been taught were now called to mind, 
and each child made his picture. Fig. 15 shows 
some of these illustrations for an Arab story. 
8. Designing a Book Cover for the Arab Story, 
“The Lance of Kanana,” by H. W. French. The 
children discussed what it was absolutely necessary 
to put on the cover. The first element they de- 
cided upon was the title. This title, “The Lance 
of Kanana,” was printed on the board to give the 
children some idea of a good style of lettering for a 
title. They looked at several books and noted the 
arrangement of the titles on the covers. Each child 
then cut out of manila paper a rectangle to illustrate 
the size and shape which he thought the actual 
printing of the title ought to occupy on the cover.
-P-A-G-E-38
  32 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
Several children then stood before the class, and each 
placed the rectangle he had chosen upon a shape 
drawn on the blackboard to represent the size of 
his cover and showed the class where he thought the 
printing would look best. These arrangements were 
compared with those of several actual book covers. 
The class then gave their opinions of these plans. 
When each had decided upon the arrangement that 
‘snited him best, several of the children drew upon 
the board the shape of their book covers and showed 
within them the space they had decided on for the 
title. 
They then talked over the question as to whether 
anything else besides the title was needed in order 
to make the cover more pleasing, and examined vari- 
ous hook covers to see what appeared in addition to 
the. title. Each child experimented by placing a spot 
on the cover, somewhere below the title, and moving 
it around to see where it would look best within 
the space. This spot was later replaced by a decora- 
tive unit. They then discussed what should be the 
nature of this unit. Different suggestions were offered 
as to interesting units which could be obtained from 
the material of the story itself, for example, the 
camel, the palm tree, the tents, and Mount Hor. 
Each child then chose his unit and drew it in the 
form which seemed to him most appropriate as a 
decoration for the book cover. The children then
-P-A-G-E-39
  Fig. 15. Tntusrrations For AN ARAB STORY
-P-A-G-E-40
  34 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
printed the titles and drew the decorative units on 
a piece of paper, making them the exact size in 
which they were to appear upon the finished book 
cover. As soon as any one of these was satisfactorily 
completed, it was transferred to the book cover by 
blacking the back of 
the piece of paper with 
a wax crayon and trac- 
ing over it (Fig. 16). 
The final results were 
then put up before the 
whole class and dis- 
cussed. Fig. 17 shows 
arrangements of these 
units used in other 
ways; for instance, as 
borders for pages. 
9. The children talked 
the story over in order 
to select a brief theme 
which seemed to them 
to represent the most 
important phases of the story. The class was then 
divided into groups, and each group chose several 
scenes, for the completion of which its members were 
responsible. The children then made and submitted 
for discussion rough sketches of these scenes. After 
these had been talked over and accepted, the finished

drawings were made. In all these illustrations Arab 
people were drawn freely. The children first made 
skeleton drawings of figures in action. Later they 
filled out these drawings and added distinctive fea- 
tures of Arab dress, following suggestions given in 
pictures and descriptions. The graphic vocabulary

which had been learned during the first few lessons of 
this step proved to be necessary for the completion of 
these illustrations. The skill which the children had 
gained by systematic practice gave them the power 
to devote their whole attention to the telling of the 
story without being hindered by too many technical 
difficulties. No one appreciated more than the children

themselves the freedom in expression which they had 
gained by painstaking preliminary study. Fig. 18 
shows scenes from “The Lance of Kanana.” 
Several lines of supplementary work developed 
from this topic. For example, in the constructive 
  Fig. 18. Intusrrations ror “Tue Lance or Kanana” 
work-a representation of an oasis was made on the 
sand table by the children. Hach object which they 
had studied in the drawing was constructed and 
placed in this. The camels and sheep were modeled 
in clay, the tents were made from cloth, the palm

trees were con- 
structed by means 
of colored papers 
and sticks, and 
people were repre- 
sented by dolls 
dressed as Arabs. 
As another in- 
stance, for the rea- 
son that Christmas 
occurred at about 
this time, the chil- 
dren made calen- 
dars for Christmas 
gifts, on which 
were represented 
scenes suggested 
by the story of the 
three wise men of 
the East (Fig. 19). 
These simple com- 
positions involved 
the use of the 
camel along with 
other forms such 
as palm trees and 
Arabs, which the   Fic. 19. A Curistmas CALENDAR 
children had had in the work of the previous weeks.  
-P-A-G-E-44
38 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
Out of this topic also developed some study of 
oriental rugs. In connection with their work in tex- 
tiles, each child made a simple loom and wove a rug. 
The design was worked out in the following steps: 
First the children were told to draw the picture of 
the sort of rug they would like to make. In addition 
to studying rugs which were brought in as examples, 
they were taken to a large store and shown different 
sorts of oriental rugs. From these sources they ob- 
tained suggestions as to the patterns of their own 
rugs. The type of loom which they used limited 
their patterns to a border across the rug. The prob- 
lem thus became one of the size and position of 
this border. 
The children cut rectangles of the size of the rug 
from paper and also cut strips of a different-colored 
paper which should represent the borders. They 
then experimented with other paper patterns, trying 
the effect of strips of different widths and moving 
them back and forth until the most pleasing division 
of spaces was decided upon. They then pasted these 
strips on the paper patterns. The results fell into 
the two general types shown in Fig. 20. The first 
one, A, was accepted by the majority of the class after 
discussion. The looms were constructed from heavy 
cardboard. The spacing of the holes for the string- 
ing involved careful measurement. This was taken 
up as a problem in mathematics and done during 
 
-P-A-G-E-45
  
  THE ILLUSTRATION OF THEMES 39 
the period devoted to arithmetic. The looms were 
then strung up, and the rugs woven according to the 
pattern. These rugs were used in the Arab tents in 
the oasis made on the sand table by the children.

In the theme work of this grade it will be noted 
that the drawing vocabulary of the first grade con- 
tributed to the new requirements of this theme of 
the second year. For example, the previously ac- 
quired knowledge of the Indian wigwam helped the 
children to draw the Arab tent. In design, the 
new interest in conventionalization of natural forms,
-P-A-G-E-46
  40 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
as shown in Fig. 17, is added to experimentation 
in good spacing. 
The theme is associated not only with history 
and with pictorial art but also with good designs 
and with constructive processes, as in the case of the 
rugs, and also with the local landscape, as in the 
comparison made between the desert of Arabia and 
the dunes of Lake Michigan. These are mutually 
reénforcing interests. 
GRADE III? 
Vikings 
In the history work of the third grade the Norse 
Vikings were taken as typical-of an exploring and 
seafaring people. Special emphasis was given to 
such topics as the Viking homes, boats, customs in 
war, feasts, dress, weapons, and life upon the sea. 
The geography dealt with the character of the coun- 
try, its fiords, mountains, and glaciers, and also with 
the life and occupations of the Norwegian people of 
to-day, the main object being to give clear mental 
pictures which would form a background for inter- 
preting the life of the old Vikings. 
The drawing based upon this subject of the Norse 
people was introduced through a study of the Viking 
ship. The children had previously worked out the

development of transportation on water and had 
made drawings which showed the different stages — 
log, raft, dugout, rowboat, canoe, sailboat. 
The class was taken to the Field Museum, where 
they saw the great Viking ship which actually crossed 
the ocean. They made a quick sketch of it, guided 
by a few definite questions from the teacher. The 
children knew the general lines upon which any

boat is constructed, for boat shapes had been con- 
stantly used since the first grade. In this way the 
characteristic lines of a boat had become a part of 
the graphic vocabulary. In the third grade, children 
were able to elaborate this general form by adding to 
it the particular characteristics necessary to represent 
a boat of striking individual character. Thus they had 
a good basis for the drawing of a Viking ship. Fig. 21 
shows the first sketch of the ship at the museum. 
From these sketches, together with many pictures 
and a small model of a Viking boat, the children 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
  42 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
worked out a good composite drawing on the board. 
In doing this a drawing was started by one child, 
and every other child contributed what he could 
  Fic. 22. First Cororep Stupy For ILLusTRATION 
and thus had a part in the completed result. At 
this stage the drawing was criticized by the class 
as a whole and corrected accordingly by individuals. 
After this drawing had been satisfactorily finished, 
each child drew one for himself, first at the board, 
   
-P-A-G-E-49
  THE ILLUSTRATION OF THEMES 43 
then on paper. Meanwhile, in the history period, 
the class was learning how the boats were made, 
the colors which the Vikings used, and other details. 
Each child made a good drawing of a ship and 
colored it (Fig. 22). 
Little attention was paid at first to the dragon- 
head, on the prow, but as soon as the children could 
  Fie. 23. Srupres or tHE Dracon-Heap 
draw the ship with considerable ease they asked to 
be shown how to draw a better dragon-head. 
This was taught by a method different from that 
used with the ship. The principal lines in a dragon- 
head were dictated to the children, the teacher 
drawing them on the board first, to show the result 
as a whole, then dictating a line at a time while the 
children drew on paper. Fig. 23, A, shows a simple 
way of fitting the dragon-head into a rectangle. 
This gave the children a diagrammatic scheme for 
drawing the head in good proportions. Fig. 23, B,
-P-A-G-E-50
44 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
shows the finished head after it had been cut out 
and mounted. The front view of a dragon-head 
was worked out by the same method. The result is 
seen in Fig, 23, C. Through this mode of proce- 
dure every child made a good dragon-head. 
' The following question arises here: After having 
learned the form in this way, are the children able 
to draw the dragon-head without the rectangle and 
adapt it to the needs of the sketches? The answer 
is shown in the results. For the first few times a 
dragon-head is drawn, most of the children continue 
to use the rectangle as an aid to the drawing. Then 
they gradually, and of their own accord, omit the 
rectangle and draw dragon-heads freely with just as 
good results. Fig. 24 shows drawings of ships, made 
after the practice on the dragon-heads. The rec- 
tangle was not used here. In every case it is true 
that the heads differ and do not conform to the 
shape given at first, yet the characteristic lines are 
retained. The front view of the ship was next 
worked out, by the same method that was used for 
the side view. The fact that the children had the 
ability to draw either front or side view gave them 
great freedom in their illustrative work for the 
Viking book. Fig. 25 gives sketches of the ship, 
showing the front view. 
The next step was the free-hand cutting of a ship, 
showing both front and side views. These views are

the making of the drawings.

information. They learned from stories in this book 
how the Vikings made their weapons. In the com- 
position periods they wrote original stories in which 
they imagined that they were the sons of Vikings, 
and they told how they made their ships and 
weapons. As they knew how to draw a ship, illus- 
trations for that part of the story were easily made,

but as yet the children had no very clear ideas 
of the Viking weapons and armor. They felt the 
need of definite information about these things and 
asked to be shown how to draw them. 
The children looked at many pictures of swords, 
spears, shields, helmets, ete. They could find these 
in their reading book, “ Viking Tales.” Then the 
teacher made upon the board drawings of several

kinds of each weapon, while the children watched 
her. As the next step, she cut from paper, free-hand,

shapes were  se-

ings. These were

in the illustrative 
work, as will be

THE ILLUSTRATION OF THEMES 49 
was necessary in order to show Vikings fighting, or 
on horseback, or in the feast hall. Consequently a 
few lessons were spent in illustrating, on the board, 
  Fic. 29. Bracksoarp Sketcn or Viking BATTLE 
a battle. The picture was started by a few children 
in the class and added to day by day until the 
board was full of these fierce characters — some
-P-A-G-E-56
  50 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
hurling spears at the foe, some struck by spears and 
falling off their horses, some having hand-to-hand 
fights. Others were running away in terror. Ships 
were seen burning in the distance, and many other 
interesting features of the fight were shown. If 
there was any doubt as to the direction of the lines 
  Fig. 30. Virixa Warriors 
in these figures, the children took the attitudes them- 
selves and were then able to represent what they 
wished. Fig. 29 shows a part of this board work. 
The value of this practice is in the resulting free- 
dom which the children show in the work for their 
books. These action lines can be filled out in a 
simple way. Fig. 30 shows examples of these.

The next step was the making of simple composi- 
tions as illustrations of Norse life. Little stress was 
put upon the drawing of the mountains and fiords. 
The children were left to represent these very much 
as they wished. However, in order to give some 
suggestions as to how to go about it, they were 
Se

given hectographed copies of a Norwegian land- 
scape. Fig. 31, A, shows the hectographed outline, 
and Fig. 31, B, the filled-in sketch. From the many 
pictures which were before the children in the room, 
they were able to choose the colors for the mountains 
and water. Then they drew one or two Viking ships 
in the fiord. Before this was done, there was some 
class discussion as to good and bad places for these

Fig. 33. A CHRISTENING AND A SEA Battle

-P-A-G-E-60
  54 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
ships, the children giving reasons for their opinions. 
In this way they learned something of the ele- 
ments of composition. The drawings were mounted 
and used to illustrate a paper on the scenery in 
Norway (Fig. 32). } 
The question may be asked: Has the teaching of 
certain objects by a series of definite steps, so that 
they are learned by heart and thus form a graphic 
vocabulary for this Norse work, limited or made me- 
chanical the free expression of the children? This 
can be answered best by the actual work of the 
children, as shown in Fig. 33. 
The steps in the constructive work and design in- 
volved in the making of a Viking book were as fol- 
lows: Many written papers and illustrations for the 
—> book had been completed before the covers were actu- 
ally made. The question arose as to the kind of covers 
needed. The children selected the color from samples 
of cardboard. In the arithmetic period the class 
worked out the dimensions of the covers, the num- 
ber which could be cut from one sheet of cardboard, 
and then the number of sheets needed for the whole 
class. When each child had his two covers cut he 
was given a strip of cloth binding to hold them 
together and also some transparent inside binding 
to which he pasted his fly leaves. He could then 
fasten his pages into the book by means of brads 
and put them in or take them out as he desired.
-P-A-G-E-61
  THE ILLUSTRATION OF THEMES 55 
As papers were finished they were put directly into 
their proper places in the books. 
The children had other constructive work in this 
Viking study, though it was not directly connected 
with the making of the book. For example, they 
constructed a feast hall out of cardboard and set 
up the entire Norse home upon the sand table. They 
made their own spears, shields, helmets, and drinking 
horns for a Viking story which they dramatized. 
The first and most important problem in design 
was the decoration of the book covers after they were 
made. The children first decided upon the necessary 
decoration — the title and name of the author. Then, 
as they wished for some decoration which was sug- 
gestive of the contents, they decided upon a spot in 
which they would work out an appropriate unit. 
They were thus limited to the placing of the two 
spots upon the cover, one for the title and name of 
the author, the other for decoration. Each child cut 
out of drawing paper several rectangles of different 
sizes, in order to see which looked best for his larger 
spot. After class criticism of many of the sizes and 
placings chosen, each child kept the one that seemed 
to him most satisfactory. This rectangle was spaced 
for the letters needed in the title and name and 
then printed with single-lined letters. The following 
questions were written on the board, so that every 
child might test his own lettering:
-P-A-G-E-62
  56 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
1. Do the letters fill the space ? 
2. Are they straight? 
3. Can they be easily read? 
Before the label could be put wpon the book cover 
it must first be transferred to a piece of tan paper 
about the same size, as this paper was to be pasted 
on the dark-green covers. 
The next step was to make the decorative unit. 
The children were left free to have a unit of any 
shape that was pleasing to them. Many chose circles 
which they decorated as shields or filled with dragon- 
heads; others took small rectangles upon which a 
ship or some weapon might be placed. They were 
transferred upon the same kind of tan paper that 
was used for the titles. 
After these two spots were transferred and ready 
to be pasted upon the cover, the question arose as to 
the best possible placing for them. Rectangles were 
drawn upon the board in the shape of the cover. 
Within these some of the children showed what 
they considered a good arrangement for the two 
spots. The majority of the class were usually agreed 
as to what was good spacing. After the decision had 
been made, each child pasted his title and unit on his 
cover. Fig. 34 gives one of the finished book covers. 
Upon examining books, the children found that 
each one had a title-page; consequently their Vik- 
ing books must have title-pages. Some of the

children used for this the same printing which they 
had designed for the cover by simply transferring 
  Fig. 34. Cover ror THE Vikinc Boox 
the original directly to the title-page; others made 
new titles. The emphasis here was put upon clear 
lettering and good spacing (Fig. 35).

When the book covers were completed, and the 
flyleaves and title-pages in, the children began to 
arrange their written work and illustrations in the
-P-A-G-E-65
  THE ILLUSTRATION. OF THEMES oe 59 
sequence which had been decided upon by the class as 
a whole. All the written papers were planned so that 
the spacing was pleasing ; each page had equal mar- 
gins on the sides and a wider margin at the bottom. 
Throughout the year the class had experience in 
making rhythmic borders, using as units objects 
which they had drawn or which were in the room. 
After seeing good examples of decorated pages, they 
wished to decorate the pages of their Viking books. 
They therefore suggested that they do so by means 
of these rhythmic borders. Consequently many bor- 
ders were made, using units from the Viking work. 
The children made their borders as nearly as possible 
suggestive of the story upon the page which was 
decorated. Fig. 36 gives a page taken from one of 
the Viking books. 
After the book was completed the pages were num- 
bered, and the table of contents and list of illustra- 
tions were made. These pages were also decorated by 
borders. 
Some of these books contained over seventy-five 
pages, others had less, but each book represented 
the best work of the child who made it. 
As an outcome of making a completed piece of 
work in this carefully planned way, these results 
may be noted: 
1. Every child in the class had learned, by a defi- 
nite method of procedure, to draw certain objects well.
-P-A-G-E-66
60 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
  2. When children have learned to draw things 
confidently and well, they use them freely in compo- 
sition and modify the appearances to suit conditions.

3. This systematically acquired knowledge of   par-

On the contrary, it proves to be a starting point for 
attaining an originality and spontaneity which have 
a range impossible to the limited kind of freedom in 
using crude symbols that results from untrained work.

4. The children gain some idea of good spacing 
and arrangement, which are the foundation of deco- 
rative design and of pictorial composition. - 
In this one completed piece of work the child has 
compiled and related materials from the work he 
has done in drawing, history, geography, literature, 
reading, composition, writing, and spelling during 
a period of three months. It is a result which is 
a permanent concrete thing and helps to render 
lasting and vital the different lines of interest 
which have been awakened. 
GRADE IV 
Greek Life 
This topic occurs in the history outline of Grade 
IV and was utilized as being the most interesting 
subject for drawing. The first need in this topic was 
of books in which to keep written work and illustra- 
tions. Here was a demand for design, because the 
style of these books should be in keeping with the 
subject. Therefore every opportunity to make them 
Greek in style was utilized. 
1. Cover for the Book. The children discussed the 
necessary elements which would enter into the mak- 
ing of a cover; for example, the title, author’s name, 
etc. They then talked over what might appropri- 
ately be used as decoration, and the following point 
was decided upon, namely, that the decoration should 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
  62 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
be suggestive of the contents. They examined books 
from the library which referred to Greek life, and 
noted the general plan and design of the covers. They 
then decided that the decoration might’ be in one of 
two forms, either a single unit or a border. This was 
the first time that a border had been used in orna- 
menting a book cover. The children made quick 
sketches in order to show the plan which each would 
prefer for the cover. The result was different in each 
case. This gave opportunity for class criticism and 
for mutual comparison of results. In the light of 
these suggestions the sketches were then enlarged to 
the full size of the cover, and each child made his 
as satisfactory as possible. The children then worked 
directly on the cover, sketching where the units and 
the borders would later be drawn in and completing 
the general plan. The final form of the designs was 
postponed for further study. 
2. Study of Greek Designs. Examples of Greek 
designs from books, pottery, architecture, etc. were 
studied, and the children made tracings of three or 
four simple and typical designs for the sake of gain- 
ing familiarity with the forms and some appreciation 
of the style. An unexpected interest on the part of 
the children was apparent as a result of this study. 
They became interested in the scheme of color. They 
found pleasure in the technical processes, particularly 
in the free sweep of the brush required to produce
-P-A-G-E-69
  THE ILLUSTRATION OF THEMES 63 
the forms, and they enjoyed also searching for exam- 
ples of Greek ornament and reporting where they had 
found them. They gathered quite a list of Greek 
designs which they had seen elsewhere. In the course 
of this work each child made a page of Greek designs 
for his book (Fig. 37). The children then experi- 
mented in adapting some of these designs for use on 
their covers and selected one to be drawn on the 
cover with a black crayon. Fig. 38 shows prelimi- 
nary sketches and the final cover.

3. Study of Greek Vases. Examples of Greek vases 
from the museum were brought into the room, and 
the shapes of a few were drawn and cut out. These 
were colored with water color carried over the surface 
in a simple wash. Then the designs were drawn upon 
this. This work made the children familiar with 
the shape of the vases and with the style and dis- 
tribution of the ornaments. Each child then made 
a page of these vase forms for his book, as an illus- 
tration of the written work. Fig. 39 shows drawings 
of Greek vases.

examples of Greek design. The children made many 
sketches in pencil, showing the outline of the Greek 
buildings which they had seen, and then with black 
water color made a silhouette of the Acropolis, show- 
ing the Parthenon (Fig. 40). They then made in clay 
a model of the Acropolis and Parthenon. This work 
was followed by a study of Greek costumes. The 
  Fie. 40. Smuoverre or THE PartHenon 
children collected information from the descriptions 
in the history and from pictures. The school is sup- 
plied with a costume box, and the children posed in 
Greek costume. They then drew silhouettes of fig- 
ures in Greek costume. Some quick pencil sketches 
were made, to show figures in action. These were 
first made with skeleton lines and then filled out 
and suggestions of costume added. With this data 
in mind the. children now made illustrations for

stories which had occurred in connection with the his- 
tory. Hach child chose a different story. Fig. 41 shows 
illustrations for “The Wooden Horse,” “Atlas and 
Hercules,” ‘ Pegasus,” ‘‘ Telemachus and the Bow.” 
The question may be raised as to the ability of 
children in Grade IV to arrive at any true appre- 
ciation of Greek art. Without entering into any

discussion of this in general, the following actual re- 
sults were evident. The children enjoyed finding and 
recognizing examples of Greek design in architecture 
and pottery. They became interested in Greek cos- 
tume and figures. They were on the alert to discover 
from various sources things relating to Greek life. 
They thus gained a general acquaintance which could 
not fail to add to any later and more definite interest.

GRADE V 
Roman Life 
In connection with their history the children 
of this grade were studying stories of Roman life. 
This topic was therefore chosen to be used in con- 
nection with the drawing. Each child selected from 
among the stories of Roman history the one he 
wished to illustrate. As in previous topics, he made 
a written list of the objects which he needed to learn 
how to draw in order to use them in his picture. 
Considerable time was spent in looking up reference 
material in order to obtain these data, and the chil- 
dren made notes and sketches of the items of infor- 
mation which they discovered. Fig. 42 shows a page 
of the sort of sketches which the children made 
when searching the reference material for items of 
information. The school has, in addition to the 
general school library, a classified collection of sev- 
eral thousand pictures gathered from books, maga- 
zines, photographs, and other sources. In learning 
to draw any particular form, the children found 
in this collection abundant reference material, and 
an important part of their training was in the 
direction of leading them to see how they could 
secure for themselves the necessary information. 
For example, the child who chose to illustrate 
Hannibal Crossing the Alps went to the school

library and picture museums to look up the partic- 
ular type of mountains needed. She then traced 
several sky lines, showing the silhouettes of Alpine 
mountain shapes, and practiced drawing these until 
she could represent their character. As a result of 
this study, her drawings of the Alps were very

different from the ordinary symbols used by children 
for mountains. Some of the children had to spend 
a good deal of time in learning how to draw horses 
and oxen and elephants. When they drew people, 
if they were in any doubt as to the action lines 
which .were needed to tell the story in the first 
trial sketch and which were later to be filled in, 
they posed in the positions called for and thus got
-P-A-G-E-76
  70 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
the correct expression of lines. In the course of this 
work it was occasionally found that certain children 
had already learned to draw particular things well. 
For example, one girl who had no special talent in 
drawing had been taught by her father how to 
draw horses. She had practiced those until she 
could draw a horse well in almost any position. 
Her ability in this one line was recognized by the 
other children, and when horses were needed in 
their sketches they were anxious that she should 
either help them or draw their horses for them. 
Consequently she taught many of the children to 
draw horses. This is additional evidence that ability 
in drawing is developed not in general but in 
specific lines, and that because a person can draw 
one thing well it does not therefore follow that he 
can draw everything. 
After each child had worked upon the various 
items which he was to include in his picture until 
he had gained definite knowledge and enough skill 
to give him confidence, he produced a rapidly drawn 
plan of his picture which showed in a general way 
the composition. Some discussion of these sketches 
followed, in which they were compared with pic- 
tures which were examples of good composition. 
The next step was the final drawing of the illus- 
tration, and last of all the color was applied by 
means of crayons. Some of the stories chosen were

as follows: “Cincinnatus at the Plow,” ‘The Forum,” 
“ Gladiators,” ‘‘ Horatius at the Bridge.” Each child 
completed a Roman-history book in which these pic- 
tures were placed. Figs. 43 and 44 show some of 
these sketches. In this grade appeared the first 
noticeable signs of independence in investigating 
sources for material to be used in drawings. 
GrRAvDE VI 
Pioneer Life 
The history of this grade includes a study of 
pioneer life. This subject offers excellent oppor- 
tunity for illustration. The method of presenting 
one topic, travel by canal boat, is here given. The 
illustration for this topic differed somewhat from the 
previous illustrative drawing, in that every member 
of the class introduced practically the same material 
into his sketch; namely, the canal boat and the 
canal. Many pictures of canal boats were gathered. 
From these, and with the help of the children’s de- 
scriptions, the materials for which they had obtained 
from their histories, the teacher drew a canal boat on 
“the board, making the construction as simple as pos- 
sible and yet giving the essential lines upon which 
the different styles of canal boats might be built. 
Each child then practiced the canal-boat shape, 
making a page of sketches of several sizes and

shapes. The various possible positions of the boat 
was an important topic. These drawings were then - 
placed on exhibition and discussed. From among 
these sketches each child chose the one which he 
 
-P-A-G-E-81
  THE ILLUSTRATION OF THEMES 75 
thought would be most interesting in a composition, 
He then enlarged this upon another piece of paper, 
improving the drawing as much as possible. After 
this he experimented with arrangements by inclosing 
his drawing of the canal boat within a rectangle of 
the size desired for the picture. 
The other elements which he thought necessary 
were then added, such as trees, water, etc. Pictures 
involving somewhat similar effects were used for 
suggestions regarding good composition. The chil- 
dren then completed their sketches in pencil outline 
and added three values or tones of light and dark. 
Ideas for coloring were obtained from good pictures, 
and clear tones in water color were added to the 
sketches. These pictures were mounted and used 
as full-page illustrations in the history book. 
Another illustration made for this same history 
topic was a scene which showed early pioneer life. 
The method of presentation in this instance differed 
" somewhat from the preceding. Each child selected 
the phase of pioneer life he wished to illustrate. 
As these were all different in character, lists (of 
which the following are examples) were made which 
summed up the elements which should be contained 
in each picture. 
A Fortified Village. Fort: blockhouse, palisade, cabins (13), 
trees (3 or 4), gate, man, hill, forest, horse.

Katherine Eisendrath 
An-Early Farm Cabin. Cabin: chimney, window, door, 
path, forest, chair, road, green pasture, fire, a few kettles, stones, 
fence, sun. Robert Harper 
On the basis of these lists every child made his 
page of sketches in order to show how much knowl- 
edge he had of each object before it was put into 
the final picture. Some children had to look up pic- 
tures of log cabins from the museum collection, 
others spent much time practicing the drawing of 
trees, while others worked upon different objects. 
The first sketches of the composition were then made 
and discussed, to determine which were good, and 
why. After all possible improvements had been 
made, the sketches were completed in outline and 
light and dark. Three tones of color were then 
added, and this sketch was also used as an illustra- 
tion in the history book. Fig. 45 shows preliminary 
sketches. Figs. 46 and 47 give final results in color. 
LANDSCAPE IN CONNECTION WITH GEOGRAPHY 
Landscape is a subject which forms a prominent 
part of the illustrative work of every grade. It occurs 
for the most part in connection with the illustration 
of themes, as will be seen if one refers to the subjects 
which have been chosen as topics for illustration. If

78 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
one analyzes landscape drawing, he finds that a 
limited number of elements will produce most of the 
effects. For example, mountains and hills, rivers, 
trees, lakes, and plains are the main features. There 
are very few types of horizon lines. During the first 
years in school the-children become familiar with a 
few examples of these types. As they grow older 
they learn more and more definitely the variations in 
character of the elements. For example, there are 
three kinds of mountains — the volcano, the low 
rolling mountain, and the jagged rocky mountain; 
there are three kinds of trees —the deciduous, the 
tropical, and the evergreen. By learning to draw 
these in the,grades where they naturally occur in 
connection with the geography, it was found by the 
end of the seventh year that the children knew how 
to draw nearly every kind of geographic landscape. 
At the same time they were acquiring a graphic 
vocabulary which included animal and plant forms 
and constructed objects. In the first three grades 
the landscape work was very simple. Little was said 
about methods of drawing, The children gained their 
knowledge of form and technique chiefly by watch- 
ing the teacher as she drew. There is no greater 
stimulus to drawing or more effective way of acquir- 
ing knowledge as to how to draw than one gets 
by seeing a person draw with skill and facility the 
things which he himself is trying to represent.

The only drawing materials used for the landscape 
work in the primary grades were pencils, paper, and 
colored crayons, No water colors were used until the

and upper grades the same forms which were draw

somewhat crudely in the primary grades occurred 
again and again, and at each stage were elaborated 
with much more knowledge of detail and structure, 
with greater accuracy, and with better technical 
methods. An illustration of the kind of drawing 
which may be used in connection with geography 
is given in detail in the description of a seventh- 
grade theme on page 84. The following outline

gives the more important forms which the chil- 
dren add to their graphic vocabulary in each grade. 
When viewed from the standpoint of landscape draw- 
ing, the themes already described in connection with 
  Fie. 50. Sketcues in Grape II or Aras Lire in THE Desert 
geography or history are seen to contain the following 
distinctly landscape elements. : 
In Grade I, in connection with the Indian theme, 
the lake and deciduous forest were drawn (Fig. 48). 
In Grade II, in connection with the “Story of 
Ab” (Fig. 49) and with the theme of shepherd life
-P-A-G-E-89
  THE ILLUSTRATION OF THEMES 83 
(Fig. 50), the deciduous forest occurred again, and 
in addition the children learned to draw the appear- 
ance of the desert, dunes, and rocky mountains, to- 
gether with tropical vegetation such as palm trees, 
cacti, desert grass, etc. 
In Grade IIT, under the topic “ Norway,” the chil- 
dren reviewed mountains, studying those of a some- 
what different shape, and drew the glacier, the coast 
line, including fiords and mountainous cliffs, and 
added to their drawing of the deciduous forest the 
pine trees. In this grade childven studied also Swit- 
zerland and Holland and learned to draw the charac- 
teristic sky lines of these countries. They also studied 
some local history, which, in the locality of Chicago, 
includes the coast line of the lake and the broad 
expanses of the prairie. (Hig. 51.) 
“In Grade IV the geography again included deserts, 
shores, cliffs, mountains, and valleys. 
In Grade V these same items were studied in con- 
nection with the geography of the United States. 
The children now drew in more detail mountains of 
high and low altitude, the shapes of volcanoes, the 
aspects of shores and cliffs, and the trees of various 
latitudes (Fig. 52). 
In Grade VI two of the countries studied in geog- 
raphy were Mexico and Japan, and here the children 
reviewed the same landscape elements of plains, val- 
leys, volcanoes, shore lines, trees, ete., with more

intensive study of the characteristics of the shapes 
(Fig. 53) and with greater attention to details. 
The work of Grade VII involved a rapid review

Instead of a single theme, all the drawing which

was taken in connection with geography in this grade 
is here outlined. This work included maps, plant 
drawing, object drawing, and design and constituted 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
  86 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
most of the drawing for the first half of the year. It 
illustrates the general type of work in connection 
with the geography for Grades VI and VIT. 
1. The Map of South America. (a) The children 
studied the shape of South America in the following 
way: The map on the wall was divided into fourths 
by means of a vertical and a horizontal line, crossing 
in the center. It was found that the general propor- 
tion of width to height was as two to three. The 
children therefore drew a rectangle in these propor- 
tions and divided this into fourths as the map had 
been divided. They then traced in the air with their 
fingers the direction of the northern coast line and 
followed this exercise by drawing a line on paper in 
the rectangle. In the same way they traced in the 
air and then drew upon paper the eastern coast line, 
then the western. The details of the coast shape 
were not fully shown in these lines, which indicated 
merely the general directions. Fuller details were 
then observed and added. Each line was made under 
the guidance of well-directed questions. 
(b) The children drew the map again, using the 
rectangle, as in the previous lesson, as an aid to gen- 
eral proportions and the location of prominent points. 
Each child now worked without guidance from the 
teacher. Up to this point the map was before the 
children when they made the drawings. The follow- 
ing steps were memory drawings.
-P-A-G-E-93
  THE ILLUSTRATION OF THEMES 87 
(c) After this preliminary acquaintance with the 
shape, the children, with their eyes closed, traced in 
the air the shape of the map. They then drew maps 
free-hand on paper, without using the rectangle as 
guide. These drawings were then compared with 
the map and discussed, and a second drawing was 
made in the same manner. In almost every case this 
second drawing was better than any that preceded 
it and was kept for future use. It was found that 
-every child out of a class of thirty-five could draw 
the shape of South America well from memory. (See 
Fig. 57.) 
(d) Preparatory to coloring the map, the children 
practiced making flat washes of water color. They 
then studied colored maps in books and on the wall 
and discussed these. They concluded that these maps 
were for the most part inharmoniously colored. They 
then decided upon harmonious tones to be used. 
They chose soft neutral colors, because this partic- 
ular map was to be used for indicating certain agri- 
cultural and industrial sections by putting other 
colors over the first wash. 
(e) The children studied relief maps to see how 
different characteristics of the earth’s surface were 
indicated. This necessitated a review of different 
parts of the country; for example, mountains along 
the western coast, plateaus in the central west, hills 
in eastern Brazil, long slopes in Argentina, ete.
-P-A-G-E-94
  88 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
The children practiced at the board and on paper, 
with charcoal, crayon, and soft pencil, in making 
relief maps which should show clearly the different 
kinds of surface they were intended to represent. 
When each child succeeded in making clear and 
understandable drawings, he completed his own map. 
In the end each of the thirty-five children had made 
a good relief map of South America. The teacher of 
geography was in the room throughout the discus- 
sions and took great interest in each step of the 
work. Questions which arose regarding geographical 
facts were constantly referred to her. 
(f) The children next decided upon the words to 
be printed as titles under their maps, for example, 
“Relief Map of South America” and the name of 
the child; or “South America, by” so and so. The 
children then completed the printing under guidance 
of the following directions, which were placed on the 
board and discussed at each step : 
1. Cut strips of paper the size and shape which you think 
the printing on your map should occupy. 
2. On another piece of paper trace around this with pencil. 
3. Within this outline, lightly space your letters. 
4, Practice making all these letters on a paper until you 
ean do them well. 
5. Finish the letters which you have lightly sketched within 
the space. 
6, Apply to your work the following test questions: Are the 
letters straight? Do they fill the space ? Are they legible ? 
7. Transfer the printing to your map.
-P-A-G-E-95
  THE ILLUSTRATION OF THEMES 89 
In connection with the printing on the maps, the 
necessity arose for a good style of alphabet. Each 
child traced a good alphabet in capitals and also 
in lower-case letters and then practiced rapid print- 
ing before he completed the printing on his map. 
Fig. 54 shows a finished relief map. 
2. Drawing of the Coffee Plant. The children were 
taken into the Field Museum to see a branch of the 
coffee plant. They discussed the characteristics of 
the plant, as, for example, the direction of the 
three branches that were evident in the specimen, 
the direction of the growth of the leaves from the 
stem, the opposite arrangement of the leaves on the 
stem. They made careful sketches as memoranda. 
The fact was noted that the leaves grew near where 
the branch joined the main stem. Further out on the 
branch came berries, and on the end, flowers. The 
colors were also noted—the greens and reds and 
white, etc. The children drew one part at a time, 
as the teacher dictated. First, all sketched lightly 
the direction of the stems, tracing them in the air 
and then on paper. Second, all worked together on 
the shape of the leaves, the position of the berries, 
flowers, etc. These drawings when finished were 
truthful from the botanical standpoint and were 
also good compositions from the standpoint. of 
artistic arrangement. They were then mounted so 
as to look well on a page of gray paper which was

The cacao plant and its parts were then worked -

  THE ILLUSTRATION OF THEMES 91 
had been drawn, except that the drawing of the 
coffee plant was completed on the spot, while notes 
on the cacao plant were taken, and the drawing 
worked out from these at home. It was found that 
the steps followed in the drawing of the coffee plant 
helped the children definitely in their work with the 
  Fig. 55. DRAWINGS or THE CACAO AND THE Correr PLANT 
cacao plant. These also were mounted on a page 
for the book. 
3. Making of Book Cover. This lesson was given 
partly as a test of the ability of the children to work 
out a problem entirely from directions written on 
the board. The following order of steps was placed 
before the children, and the instructor in drawing 
then left the class in charge of another teacher, so
-P-A-G-E-98
92 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
that no questions were asked by the children during 
the exercises. 
1. Draw a rectangle, five inches by two inches. 
2. Space lightly the letters for the title “ Geography,” so 
that they will entirely fill the rectangle. 
3. If this spacing is pleasing, work over the letters until the 
form of each is satisfactory. 
4. Ask yourself these questions : 
(a) Do the letters fill the space ? 
(6) Do they stand vertically ? 
(ec) Can they be read easily ? 
5. If you can answer “yes” to each question, then darken 
the lines of the letters. 
6. Make a rectangle five inches by one-half inch, and 
within this, space the letters for your own name in the 
same manner. 
The style of letter used was obtained from an 
alphabet furnished to the children. Every one of 
the thirty-five sheets made during this test was 
good. At the next lesson, after some discussion of 
what constituted good arrangement, each child trans- 
ferred’ his title and name to a rectangle of the same 
size and lighter in color than the book cover and 
mounted it on the cover. Fig. 56 shows a completed 
cover. 
4. Map of Africa. The following method of 
teaching the map of Africa presented an approach 
different from that used in connection with the 
map of South America. It began with the detailed 
shape, without the help of geometric construction

lines. The children drew a map of Africa directly 
from the map hanging on the wall. In this first 
  Fig. 56. Cover ror THE Book or GroGRapuy Lessons 
drawing no help was given by the teacher. They 
then cut the shape of the map out of paper from 
memory, as a test of their knowledge of the form.
-P-A-G-E-100
  94 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
On tracing paper they then traced a map of Africa, 
directly from the atlas. This drawing called their 
attention to details which had escaped their notice 
when they drew from the map in the first place 
‘and also rectified their distorted ideas of shape. 
In accomplishing these ends, tracing, if rightly used, 
is a valuable supplementary method of mastering 
form. Two transfers of this tracing- were made, by 
blacking the back and placing it on another sheet 
of paper and then tracing over the outline. After 
this practice the children indicated the shape of the 
map in the air with their fingers. They then drew 
the map free-hand and followed this by a cutting 
of the map. These steps were carried on rapidly, 
and the whole series was completed in one lesson 
of half an hour. The purpose of this work corre- 
sponded to that of rapid drill in arithmetic. . 
In the next lesson the children again traced the 
map of Africa from the atlas, for further experience 
with the details of its shape. They then drew the 
map free-hand from memory. The fcllowing test 
was given: the children drew from memory on one 
sheet the niap of Africa, which they had just studied, 
and on another the map of South America, which 
they had studied in the way already described, but 
which had not been drawn for over two months. 
There was little difference observable in the quality 
of the results between the maps of South America and

of Africa, which indicates two things: first, that any 
systematic series of steps so planned as to give con- 
tinual increase of knowledge and to call for expres- 
sion of this knowledge at each step will bring good 
results ; second, that shapes thus learned become 
a relatively permanent part of the child’s vocabulary.

5. Illustration of Central Africa. (a) The class had 
been studying the jungle region of Central Africa. 
The instructor discussed with the children typical 
scenes in the tropics, including the homes of the 
natives, their dress and occupations, the banana and 
rubber industries, hunting, preparing food, ete.; im- 
plements, such as weapons and canoes; the vegeta- 
tion and animals. Each child decided upon the 
scene he wished to picture, and made a definite 
written statement, telling the subject for his picture 
and giving a list of the objects which he had decided 
to put into it. These were passed in to the teacher for 
examination. The following are typical lists: 
A House Scene. A house, natives, landscape around house, 
animals, small river, canoe lying by river.

(b) The next lesson opened with a discussion of 
statements handed in at the last lesson. The chil- 
dren made a page of quick sketches of the things 
which they would put into their pictures. These 
were crudely done, because of lack of knowledge, 
but the children used them as suggestions of the 
points on which they needed further information. 
They then went to the library to look up descrip- 
tions of points regarding which they were ignorant, 
and they also searched photographs and book illus- 
trations for data with which to elaborate their 
sketches. They made careful studies of the shapes 
and characteristics of the objects which they planned 
to use in their sketches. The discussion, preliminary 
sketches, and study of reference material occupied 
two lessons. 
(c) In the next lesson they discussed some of the 
essential principles of composition ; for example, the 
shape of the rectangle which would be best for their 
picture. They noted the effect of pictures of dif- 
ferent proportions and decided which seemed most 
pleasing. They then made the general division of 
sky and land, giving reasons why their picture 
would look better with more sky than land or with 
more land than sky. They examined pictures to
-P-A-G-E-104
  98 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
see how the artist directed attention to what was 
of greatest importance or interest in the picture. 
They found that sometimes this was done by em- 
phasizing the size of the object, again by its color, 
and still again by its placing or by making the 
prominent lines of the picture tend toward it. 
They then chose the place for that object which was 
to be of the greatest interest in their own pictures 
and experimented with means of emphasizing it. 
They divided the areas of their pictures into three 
groups, the large, the medium, and the small, and 
worked out the details of these areas and masses in 
order to make their character clearly understood. 
(d) At the next lesson the work of the previous 
lesson was reviewed orally. The children worked 
out rapidly with pencil a plan for their pictures, 
embodying the suggestions of the discussion. These 
were considered from the point of view of good pro- 
portion and arrangement, after which corrections 
were made. 
(e) In the next lesson the effect of beautiful lines 
was discussed. Good examples were shown. The 
children worked over their sketches in order to give 
to the lines some rhythmic arrangement. They dis- 
cussed the main values, or tones of light and dark, 
that should come into the sketches, referring to 
pictures which showed the effect of values. After 
this the sketches were worked over and the values 
 
-P-A-G-E-105
  THE ILLUSTRATION OF THEMES 99 
introduced. Each child was limited to three tones 
of light and dark in his sketch. 
In connection with these individual sketches a 
composite drawing was made upon the board. One 
child outlined a good-sized rectangle of pleasing pro- 
portions. Another child, who had made the best

studies of African huts, sketched in examples of 
these. Others, who had been especially successful 
along some other particular line, added the items 
which they had learned, such as men, trees, imple- 
ments, ete, until the picture was completed. The 
children discussed this at each step, and if any child 
thought he could make a better drawing of a partic- 
ular item than the one shown on the board, and

could justify his confidence by a. sketch on paper, 
he was allowed to replace the drawing on the board 
by his own. Thus the picture developed to as great 
a degree of excellence as the children could carry it. 
This experimentation on the board was a very defi- 
nite help and stimulation to the individual drawings. 
  Fig. 61. Group or Ittusrrations ror CENTRAL AFRICA 
After the sketches were completed in pencil with 
the three values of light and dark, each child worked 
out some pleasing color scheme, getting suggestions 
from colored prints. The tones were put on flat in 
water color over the drawing. These pictures were 
then mounted and placed as colored illustrations in 
‘the geography book. Figs. 58 and 59 show the work

of two children, and Fig. 60 shows the final sketches 
of other children. These represent the average attain- 
ment of the class, as will be seen by comparing 
Fig. 61, which gives the final sketches of other 
members of the class. The following written test 
was given at the close of the work, and twenty 
minutes was allowed for the answers. 
1. What steps would you take in making an illustration 
for your geography or your history work ? 
2. What questions would you ask in criticizing such an 
illustration ? 
3. Which of these compositions, No. 1 or No. 2, do you like 
better ? [Two compositions were placed before the children 
for their judgment.] Why ? 
4. Make a quick sketch, to show how you would improve 
the poorer one. 
THE ILLUSTRATION OF LITERATURE 
The examples here given of the use of drawing in 
connection with literature are selected from Grades I 
and VII. This offers a comparison between the work 
of the first and of the last year in the elementary 
school. 
GRADE I 
Fifteen of the poems of Christina Rossetti were 
chosen for the first grade to memorize as a part of 
the literature study. These were printed on the 
school press by the seventh-grade printing class, so 
that each child could have his own copies of the
-P-A-G-E-110
  104 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
poems. In order to keep them in permanent form, 
the children suggested that they make a book out of 
them, designing a cover and illustrating certain of 
the poems. 
The first poem selected for illustration was ‘' Mix 
a Pancake.” During the literature period the grade 
teacher let each child make a picture on the board 
which would tell the story of the poem as he imag- 
ined it. These were not erased, but kept until the 
special art teacher came for her lesson. She led the 
children to criticize each of the drawings, first from 
the standpoint of what was good in the picture. In 
this criticism the following questions were frequently 
asked, “ What do you like best about it?” ‘“ Why?” 
Then followed the question, “ What would you do 
to this picture to make it better?” Each child cor- 
rected his picture as nearly as he could according to 
the suggestions given. He was then ready to make 
his drawing on paper of the right size for his book. 
When these drawings were nearly finished, the chil- 
dren, one at a time, brought them to the front of the 
room for criticism. As each picture was shown, the 
question was asked of the class, ‘“ What is the one 
thing he can do now to help this drawing?” This 
specific question brought ready responses from the 
children, and they offered their suggestions freely. 
Much better results were obtained through this sort 
of constructive class criticism than in any other way.
-P-A-G-E-111
   
-P-A-G-E-112
  106 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
As in all of the illustrations of this grade, pencil and 
colored crayons were used, and each drawing when 
finished was mounted on a page for the book (Fig. 62). 
The second poem chosen for illustration was “If a 
Pig wore a Wig.” The grade teacher, in the same 
manner as: before, worked out the preliminary sketch 
before the art teacher’s lesson occurred, but in this 
case there was great trouble in making the drawings, 
for no child knew how to draw a pig. When the 
pictures were criticized, each one was evidently unsat- 
isfactory. The children said, “ That does not look like 
a pig.” Consequently it was found necessary to devote 
some supplementary practice to the drawing of pigs. 
For the sake of making the children’s progress 
more evident, each drawing described in the follow- 
ing steps was kept for final comparison. They were 
first asked to draw a pig as they thought it looked 
(B, in Fig .63). A hectographed drawing of a pig (A) 
was then placed before each child, and he was asked 
to copy this. These drawings (0) were better, but 
still hardly recognizable. Ag a third step the chil- 
dren were asked to trace the hectographed outline sev- 
eral times. After each practice in tracing (D), which 
was done on thin paper so that the shape could be 
reversed, the children were ready again to make a 
free drawing. A comparison of # with C, the copy 
made by the same child from the hectographed outline, 
shows that tracing may contribute to the knowledge

of the form something which is not gained by copy- 
ing. Attention is directed to details which before 
had escaped the eye. 
As a test of whether the children in this class had 
really learned the shape of the pig and could adapt 
it to any position, they were asked to make quick 
sketches which would show pigs in a barnyard, as 
the children remembered them when they had seen 
  Fic. 64. ILLustRATION MADE AFTER THE CHILDREN HAD STUDIED 
THE SHAPE OF A PIG 
them in the country (Fig. 64). After this they were 
ready to proceed with their drawings for the poem. 
They could now draw pigs which were easily rec- 
ognizable. When a high standard of attainment in 
illustrative drawing is reached only by a very few 
in the class, it is probably because there is little sys- 
tematic study of the shapes which are to be used. 
The drawing stops with the first exercises. The 
teacher often exhibits only the two or three sketches 
made by the talented children and allows the others

  110 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
to pass, because she regards them as the best that 
children without special talent can do. Systematic 
study, on the other hand, is not content with accept- 
ing the child’s idea as it stands, but develops both 
the idea and its expression so that each attains some 
degree of excellence. These illustrations show that 
development is possible for the majority of the class. 
In somewhat the same manner seven or eight poems 
were illustrated. The children took time to practice 
on the forms that were needed by the class as a whole, 
such as ships, wind-blown trees, hills, ete. Simple 
principles of composition which were continually 
needed were discussed, and good examples were kept 
constantly before the class. 
The making of the cover, the mounting of the 
poems and illustrations, and the working out of dec- 
orative units for pages having no illustrations pre- 
sented many problems in design. Fig. 65 shows 
pages from these books of poems. : 
GRADE VII 
An important unit of work in the English of the 
seventh grade was centered around the topic of life 
saving. The children gathered data for this study 
from stories, pictures, poems, and experiences, and 
to this they added original poems and stories. The 
greater part of the English book which each child 
made in Grade VII was occupied with this theme.
-P-A-G-E-117
  THE ILLUSTRATION OF THEMES 111 
The drawing therefore found in this, as in other 
topics, an interest already awakened and material 
which was full of pictorial suggestion. Among the 
material for illustration which readily suggested itself 
were such details as lighthouses, life boats, life savers, 
effects of the ocean, and scenes which were suggested 
by written work of the children. The children made 
collections of pictures relating to these topics from 
every source possible. 
The order of steps followed in working up an illus- 
tration is here given. The poem which was chosen 
as being especially suggestive of pictorial material 
was “ The Coast Guards,” by E. Miller. The children 
were already familiar with this poem through their 
study of English, and therefore it was unnecessary 
to make a careful study of its meaning for the 
sake of drawing. The teacher read it aloud once, 
in order to bring the images again clearly to mind. 
When this had been done, each child wrote on a 
piece of paper a list of the pictures which the poem 
called up in his mind. Each child then made a page 
of quick sketches to show roughly some of the scenes 
recorded on his list. These sketches showed again 
the value of listing in written form the elements 
which should be included in the drawing. Then fol- 
lowed. a class discussion which resulted in selecting 
from each page one sketch of the many which the 
children had made—the sketch which seemed to
-P-A-G-E-118
112 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
possess the most pictorial possibilities. To reénforce 
these, pictures were brought in which showed various 
scenes of storms, coast guards, life savers, boats, etc. 
The teacher’s collection was supplemented by con- 
tributions which the children looked up and brought 
in. The class studied illustrations to see which 
brought out most clearly the essential points of the 
story it illustrated and what means the artist. had 
found most useful in emphasizing the points which 
he wished to make important. This necessitated 
some considerations of good composition. They then 
examined their own pictures in the light of the 
following questions : 
What is of greatest interest or importance in your picture ? 
How can you make it appear as of most importance ? 
Will you emphasize it by size, or color, or position, etc. ? 
What will determine your proportions of sky, and of water 
or land ? 
What details will you introduce ? 
This discussion led each child to construct his 
picture in his imagination with the greatest clear- 
ness. After this the children were prepared to ex- 
periment by making many sketches which should 
show different arrangements and possibilities of the 
picture which each had chosen. They discussed what 
things in their drawing they needed to understand 
better in order to picture them effectively. They 
then gathered data for each object about which they
-P-A-G-E-119
THE ILLUSTRATION OF THEMES 113 
needed more information (such as lighthouses, life 
boats, waves, etc.) and made careful studies, sketched | 
from available data, of each object which entered into 
the illustration. On the basis of this preparation in 
composition and in study of details, the final result 
was worked out. The children carried these sketches 
farther by putting three values of gray in lead pencil 
over the outline sketches. These values of gray sug- 
gested where the flat tones of color could be applied 
with best effect. 
Experiments with one or two different color 
schemes were tried before the final one was chosen. 
The completing step was the addition of the selected 
color scheme to the drawing. The tones of color 
were put on over the pencil drawing. These illustra- 
tions were then placed on exhibition, discussed by 
the class, and, so far as was practicable, corrected in 
the light of any valuable suggestions that were 
offered. Each was then mounted on a page which 
was to be placed in the English book. This unit of 
work covered about eight half-hour lessons. Fig. 66 
shows a few of the average results. One significant 
outcome of this systematic and progressive work was 
evident in the cases of children who possessed none 
of what is commonly termed “ artistic talent.” The 
children with so-called talent produced work far be- 
yond the average in their first sketches, but those 
who realized the necessity for-study were encouraged
-P-A-G-E-120
  114 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
by the presentation, step by step, of single items 
which they could master and add to their resources. 
In the end, children who appeared to have no special 
ability often secured results which ranked with the 
best, both in accurate description and in artistic 
composition. Their interest in using their new ac- 
quirements, together with the discovery that they 
could do something which they had supposed was 
outside the range of their abilities, gave a stimulus 
to their work which frequently more than compen- 
sated for any lack of natural facility in drawing.

THE DRAWING OF BIRDS, PLANTS, AND THE 
HUMAN FIGURE 
THE DRAWING OF BIRDS 
GRaDEs I-III? 
The detailed steps described under this topic are 
chiefly those followed in Grade I and are typical of 
the way in which any animal form was studied. 
There is serious doubt in the minds of many edu- 
cators as to the wisdom of employing in the teaching 
of drawing during these early years a series of steps 
‘0 definitely directed by the instructor and apparently 
so mechanical in nature. One meets the following 
questions : 
1. Is the free expression of the children checked, 
and does their illustrative drawing tend to become 
mechanical, when they are taught the general shape 
of a few objects by detailed and closely directed steps? 
2. Does the knowledge gained by this sort of 
study show in the free sketching, or, when left to 
themselves, will the children go back to their crude 
symbols ?

for December, 1913, by courtesy of the School Arts Publishing Co. 
115
-P-A-G-E-122
  116 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
3. When children have studied a given form in 
detail, for example, a bird, are they satisfied to 
repeat it just as they acquired it, or does it prove a 
starting point for learning to draw a variety of 
effects? That is, does one position well learned help 
the children to draw the same thing in different po- 
sitions? Does it also help them to understand and 
draw better what they see in nature? 
From the following presentation of actual class- 
room facts, some conclusions may be drawn which 
will contribute toward an answer to the foregoing 
questions. It is taken for granted that the illustra- 
tive sketching continues to be spontaneous during 
these first years. Consequently this description does 
not deal so much with the free pictorial story-telling 
as with those lessons which are planned to supplement 
the illustrative sketching. 
The children throughout the primary grades devote 
much time to the study of birds in connection with 
their natural history. This subject of birds is there- 
fore taken as an illustration. 
In the first year only a few of the typical birds in 
the vicinity are chosen for observation and study in 
a simple way. In the second grade the children learn 
to recognize more birds and are capable of going into 
the question of their habits with much more detail. 
* During the third year the subject becomes more com- 
plex and involves the making of charts which show
-P-A-G-E-123
  THE DRAWING OF BIRDS 117 
the individual observations of the children. Thus 
there is a definite progression in this phase of natural 
history throughout the grades. 
In exactly the same manner there is a definite 
progress from year to year in the drawing. The 
series of steps by which it was presented is as fol- 
lows: The first-grade children were familiar with the 
sparrow; they had observed it in connection with 
their natural history and were now ready to learn to 
draw it. Little children, if left to themselves, draw 
out of their heads. The crude concepts which they 
already have must be developed into more adequate 
ones, and this can be done only by a knowledge of 
the actual construction of objects. For this reason a 
hectographed drawing of a sparrow (Fig. 67, A) was 
given to each child, and with this a piece of tracing 
paper. The children first traced the bird on one side 
of the tracing paper, using black crayola or a soft 
pencil (Fig. 67, B); then on the other side they 
traced over this first outline, thus producing the form 
in reversed position (Fig. 67, @). With this tracing 
three or four birds were drawn, some facing one way, 
some another. Thus the children were led to follow 
a good outline two or three times with actual pencil 
point and muscular movements. 
As soon as the majority of the class seemed to be 
making the tracings with freedom, the children were 
allowed to cut out one of them. This was used as a  
-P-A-G-E-124
  118 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
pattern by means of which several others were cut. 
This bird was placed in a specified position on the | 
paper, and the children cut around it (Fig. 67, D). 
The next step was the free-hand cutting of the shape 
of a sparrow, following as well as could be remem- 
bered the cuts made when the pattern was used 
(Fig. 67, #). By this time the class as a whole had 
some idea as to the general lines upon which a bird 
was built, but the children were as yet unable, simply 
by looking at the natural form, to represent the char- 
acteristic lines of a sparrow. In order that each child 
might be able to do this, attention was called to the 
slant of the sparrow’s back. This was seen from 
the hectographed copy and the stuffed specimen. 
The children practiced showing the slant by a move- 
ment of their hands in the air. The teacher and sev- 
eral children then made it upon the board. After this 
every child drew it with one stroke upon a piece of 
paper (Fig. 67, #). This furnished a place for begin- 
ning, an expressive structural line on which the other 
lines of the bird form might be built and with which 
they might be compared. 
Next the head and bill of the bird were studied. 
In the same way these were drawn in the air 
as the teacher drew them on the board. Then on 
a second piece of paper the line for the back was 
again drawn, and this time the head and bill were 
added, thus giving another step in the process of

  Fic. 67. Successive STEPS IN LEARNING TO DRAW A SPARROW 
119 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
  120 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
form building (Fig. 67, @). Upon the third piece of 
paper the back, head, and bill were readily drawn, 
and the line under the breast of the bird was added 
after practice in drawing it in the air and on the 
blackboard (Fig. 67, H). Then a whole bird with tail 
and legs was drawn upon a fourth sheet (Fig. 67, 7). 
Children have a great tendency to make the legs of 
a bird vertical. This was partially overcome by hav- 
ing them place their pencils so that they pointed in 
the direction of the slant of the legs. 
By the time this series of definite steps was over, 
there was not a child out of a class of thirty who 
could not draw a sparrow which was easily recogniz- 
able as such. In order to illustrate more fully the 
results which these steps produced, Fig. 68 is given, 
which shows the average drawings of a sparrow done 
with absolute freedom before this series of lessons 
was begun. It is interesting to compare these with 
Fig. 67, F. 
Following this study of the sparrow, the shape of 
the crow was learned in much the same manner. It 
is of great interest to note what points the drawing 
of the sparrow had supplied as a foundation that did 
not have to be retaught in connection with this new 
topic and which helped to interpret the form of the 
crow. They were the slant of the back, the head 
and bill, the line under the breast, and the legs and 
tail. The slant of the back was compared with that

put upon paper. Then, in the succession already noted 
in studying the sparrow, the other lines of the crow

  THE DRAWING OF BIRDS 123 
Much less time was needed for the next subject, 
which was the blue jay, because the same series of 
steps was followed. Thus satisfactory results came 
more quickly. Some practice was needed upon the 
head and bill of this special bird (Fig. 70). 
  Fic. 70. Drawines or A Brug JAY 
These three birds were taught in three weeks, 
a twenty-minute period being given daily to this 
study. The work on the sparrow took about half 
of this time. 
Other kinds of drawing were given for several 
days, then the children were asked to draw blue
-P-A-G-E-130
  124 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
jays again, with no help from the teacher. A wood- 
pecker was then shown, and with very little ques- 
tioning on the part of the teacher the class drew it. 
The results are shown in Fig. 71. 
One test of a method is to see whether its effects 
are permanent, and whether the children follow the 
same method of procedure and obtain as good results 
after intervals of time in which they are doing other 
kinds of work. For-several weeks the subject of 
birds did not occur in the art work. Then, at inter- 
vals, the children reviewed the different birds they 
had learned, and the robin and duck were added 
to the list. There were only two or three children 
who did not of their own accord follow the method 
they had learned in drawing birds. Fig. 72 shows 
memory drawings of these birds. 
There had been some question as to whether the 
class would not lose interest through having to do 
the same thing again and again. Experience proved 
that the interest increased each time the bird was 
drawn from a different standpoint or whenever a 
different bird was taken. The children enjoyed apply- 
ing the knowledge and skill they had already gained 
to the new problem, which varied sufficiently from 
what went before to require some new interpretation 
and yet made use of all that had been learned. 
It was the purpose of the instructor that each 
year should bring an increase of definite and usable

125 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
  126 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
knowledge. The new work of each succeeding year 
was based upon the processes learned during the 
year preceding, with frequent drill upon both old 
and new acquirements, in order that they might 
become permanent possessions. 
In the case of the particular topic of birds, here 
used as an illustration of progressive method, the 
children at the close of the first year in school knew 
by heart the general lines upon which any bird is 
constructed and were able to draw a few selected 
birds well. This means that they had drawn them 
repeatedly on paper and on the blackboard until the. 
forms were as familiar as those of handwriting. This 
kind of knowledge and familiarity gave the children 
ability to produce well-drawn shapes with the same 
freedom that characterized their first crude attempts. 
The results which children in the second year 
produced were in advance of those of the first year 
in the following particulars: there was greater free- 
dom on the part of the children in their method of 
drawing; there was much less need of questioning, 
and thus more independent work ; attention was given 
to smaller details, such as bills, shapes of heads, and 
slant of legs and tails. Some of these points will be 
evident in comparing Fig. 73 with the drawings of 
the first year, shown in Fig. 72. 
In the third year occasions arose for drawing the 
same birds which had been learned in the first and

the ability for adapting any form once learned. The 
following incident illustrates how previous careful

and detailed study of a bird form develops ability to 
represent characteristics readily. 
A group of third-grade children had been on an 
excursion and had seen about fifteen kinds of birds, 
many of which they had never attempted to draw. 
The stuffed specimens of these were placed before 
the class, and each child was told to choose the bird 
he liked best and draw it. No suggestions from the 
teacher were given. The results of the study of 
structure of bird forms are evident in these draw- 
ings. The few forms which the children had learned 
with some thoroughness helped them to interpret the 
new shapes, either because of their similarity to, or 
difference from, the old and familiar shapes. Among 
the results there was not one which, could not be 
easily recognized. Fig. 74 shows the average of 
this work. 
At another time the children were told to draw 
any one of the fall birds from memory. This hap- 
pened several months after these birds had been 
seen. It was interesting to note that every child 
in the group drew his bird according to the method 
by which he was first taught. (Fig. 75.) 
In the third year the previous experience and 
increased maturity of the children made possible a 
still closer study of birds. The children were able 
to draw any bird with which they were familiar. 
A great increase in skill was shown over second

grade, and more independent work was done. The 
less evident characteristics of birds were observed 
and noted, and a more careful record was made of 
the relation and proportion of parts. 
This work with birds throughout the primary grades 
is one evidence that if a child is taught the actual 3 
construction of the object from the first, he will use 
this form when left to himself rather than his origi- 
nal crude symbol, provided he has practice sufficient 
to give him facility equal to that with which he 
made his early drawings. 
This also indicates that the first symbol taught 
does not necessarily remain fixed, but that it becomes 
a means of assimilating the increasing store of facts 
of form accumulated by further study. Such a begin- 
ning thoroughly mastered gives a child confidence 
in his power to learn new objects with equal definite- 
ness, and is an important influence in classifying his 
later knowledge of similar forms. 
Grapes IV-V 
With the careful work done in the preceding three 
years as a foundation, the children were now able to 
add to their general knowledge of bird forms quite 
exact details of appearance and structure which 
served as a record for the nature study and an elabo- 
ration of the pictorial drawing. The following points 
received especial attention during these years:
-P-A-G-E-139
 
-P-A-G-E-140
134 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
1. Emphasis upon a truthful representation, show- 
ing exact proportions, direction of slants, and outlines 
of shape. 
2. Emphasis upon records of color, giving the char- 
acteristic markings of the bird. These were drawn 
with crayon and also with water color. 
3. Emphasis upon silhouettes drawn with a brush 
and ink or black paint. These silhouettes are valu- 
able as a means of testing the clearness of the 
mental image which has resulted from the previous 
study. They also give excellent practice in the use 
of the brush as a medium of expression. Fig. 76 
shows bird drawings of Grade IV, and Fig. 77, work 
of Grade V. 
4. Much time was given to using these familiar 
bird forms in a decorative way; for example, as units 
worked out on squared paper for a border or to fill a 
given space to be used as a tailpiece, etc. (Fig. 78).

1. The same forms that had been studied before 
were reviewed and new forms added. 
2. Emphasis was placed upon better technical skill. 
3. The possibilities of the different mediums for 
giving different characteristic effects were studied ; for 
example, the kind of stroke of the brush or pencil or 
crayon tells much of the character of the bird form to 
be represented (Fig. 79).

  THE DRAWING OF PLANTS 139 
The work in these grades is partly to add new 
forms to the graphic vocabulary and partly to de- 
velop that greater knowledge of form and skill in 
representation which is necessary if the ability of 
the children to express their experiences is to satisfy 
the demands of their new powers of perception. The 
results from the first grade through to the seventh— 
namely, a steady increase in the accumulation of 
knowledge of form, continually growing skill to 
represent form satisfactorily and to use the shapes 
as elements of desigzn— seem to indicate that the 
early mastery of a few typical forms gives greater 
variety and spontaneity at the end of the course 
than does unguided spontaneous drawing, however 
industriously practiced. 
THE DRAWING OF PLANTS 
Plant drawing occurs for the most part in direct 
connection with natural history throughout the 
grades. During the first three years the plant draw- 
ing is of two sorts: first, drawing for general pic- 
torial effect of those characteristics which appeal to 
children; and second, drawing for the purpose of 
keeping records of plant growth. Under the first 
head the children draw flowers which are growing 
in the schoolroom or in the garden or which they 
bring in. In this work soft crayons are used. The 
entire effect is usually sketched in first, with white

142 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
chalk. The flat side of the crayon is used, in order 
that the strokes may be big and free. The colors 
are then put over this white ground by following 
so far as possible the same strokes. The value of 
this preliminary sketching in white is, in the first 
place, that the children have a means of planning 
out the whole drawing in some medium that is not 
obtrusive, and which gives them the greatest free- 
dom;~in the second place, the white modifies the 
effect of the brilliant-colored chalks and gives them 
more nearly the appearance of the softer colors of 
the plants. The children obtained their suggestions 
regarding methods mainly frém watching the instruc- 
tor make a drawing first. Fig. 81 shows drawings 
by children in Grade 1; Figs. 82 and 83 show draw- 
ings by children in Grade II; and Figs. 84 and 85, 
by children in Grade III. 
An example of the second kind of plant drawing, 
namely, that which is used as a record of growth, 
is the following. The children in Grade I planted 
bulbs in October. They first made a drawing of the 
bulb, then of the flowerpot after the bulb had been 
planted. When it sprouted, another drawing was 
made. This was followed by successive drawings, 
illustrating different stages through the growth and 
flowering (Fig. 86). Another example occurred when 
the children were making studies of different trees 
and needed to make drawings which showed the

different kinds of leaves. Fig. 87 shows drawings 
of leaves from Grades I, IJ, and HI. During the 
first three grades the greatest value of this kind of 
drawing comes by way of the class criticisms. The 
  Fia. 84. Pranr Drawines ry Grave IIT 
children gain more from this sort of discussion than 
from any criticism made by the instructor. When 
these plant drawings can be well made and have 
served their purpose in connection with the nature 
study, the children generally have the image well 
in mind. It is possible then to carry the drawing

In Grades IV, V, VI, and VII the drawing of plants 
becomes much more detailed. One or two plants are 
selected for each grade. The problem of proportions 
and characteristics is emphasized, and attention is 
given to careful representation of details of growth 
and the foreshortening of the leaves. Fig. 90 shows

to obtain a careful drawing of the geranium plant, 
and Fig. 91 shows the final results. 
Fig. 92 shows drawings of corn stalks, made in 
connection with science work. This particular plant 
was chosen because a special study is made of it in 
the natural sciences. In these grades much emphasis 
is placed upon interpreting into decorative patterns

until it acquires a decorative character. Decorative
-P-A-G-E-160
  154 TOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
drawings are also made. These are worked out in 
different mediums—crayon, charcoal, pencil, water 
color, ink, ete. In all the grades each child mounts 
his work either on another sheet of paper or upon a 
page for one of the books which he has made. This 
cutting and spacing of margins proves to be an im- 
portant problem of design. Figs. 95 and 94 show a 
series of plant drawings by one child in Grade VI, 
including details of actual form and also decorative 
treatment. 
THE DRAWING OF THE HUMAN FIGURE 
The human figure is of all forms the most inter- 
esting to children. In the primary grades children 
depict: it freely by means of crude conventions. These 
symbols are frequently out of all true proportion and 
are caricatures. In spite of this, they are almost 
always full of expression. They tell vividly the story 
the child has in mind. During the first three years 
in school, children are so completely influenced by the 
movement of the story to be told when human figures 
are involved that they rarely pause to notice details 
of appearance which do not contribute directly to the 
action of the narrative, and which from their point of 
view are of small consequence. 
On this account. little is lost during these grades 
if the study of the actual appearance of the figure 
receives only incidental attention. However, some
-P-A-G-E-161
  THE DRAWING OF THE HUMAN FIGURE 155 
specific study of the form does improve the powers 
even of primary children to represent the human 
figure. Figs. 95 and 96 show the successive draw- 
ings by one child which illustrate the following 
steps. After the children in Grades II and III had 
sketched an illustration for Stevenson’s “Marching 
Song” (Fig. 95, A), using their ordinary symbols 
for the figures, they were given pictures of boys and 
girls, some of which were reproduced by hectograph 
and others cut from magazines. Fig. 95, B, shows the 
four figures this child chose from the sheet of draw- 
ings given her, as being the most appropriate for her 
sketch. Each child colored with crayons the figures he 
selected. The covering of the surface gave them more 
intimate familiarity with the form than could be gained 
merely by looking at it (Fig. 95, C’). They then cut 
out the shapes with scissors and also traced, them 
(Fig. 96, A). After this they drew from memory the 
figures they had previously traced and cut (Fig. 96, B). 
They then repeated their sketch for the poem. A com- 
parison of these second sketches (Fig. 96, @’) with the 
first (Fig. 95, A) showed that some definite knowledge 
of form had been gained by following the shape of a 
good drawing, as the children had done when they 
colored it and cut it out. In Fig. 97 there are 
shown the first drawings, A and B, and the last draw- 
ings, Cand D, made by two other children for this 
same poem, following the method just described,

  158 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
This work from pictures was supplemented by 
occasional drawings from children who posed in posi- 
tions illustrating the story, but the drawing from 
actual figures did not contribute so much to the 
power of the children in these grades to represent 
the figure well as it did later on. 
By the time the children have reached the inter- 
mediate grades they have grown more critical of the 
human figure than of any other of the forms which 
they are called upon to draw. It has more expres- 
siveness for them, since they themselves are human 
beings, anid they feel more readily any departure from 
the actual appearances. Some systematic study of 
figures from life and of pictures is needed to give 
them confidence. The following steps show how this 
material was presented in illustrations for European 
history in Grade V. It became necessary to use the 
figure in action. The children first drew the figure, 
representing the action merely by skeleton lines. 
Upon these lines they then built up the form as well 
as they could. In preparation for this work they had 
cut from magazines and newspapers a collection of 
figures in action. From these they selected those 
which showed the sort of action required for their 
stories. They then placed tracing paper over these 
and indicated not the outline of the form but the 
skeleton lmes which showed the action and upon 
which the form might be built. These they filled out

as best they could without the picture. This gave 
them figures the proportion and action of which were 
the same as those of the pictures and enabled them 
to make a closer comparison of shapes than would 
have been possible otherwise. After comparing their 
drawings with the picture, they made the corrections 
suggested. After this they drew the same figure 
from memory on tracing paper and then placed their 
drawings on the picture in order to note the varia- 
tions. They then cut out the figures which were best 
adapted to illustrate the story and assembled them 
in a good composition. With the suggestions thus 
obtained they sketched in on another piece of paper 
their plan for the final illustrations. Different chil- 
dren posed in the positions required, and from these 
additional data were obtained. The drawing was 
then completed. Fig. 98 shows successive drawings 
made by one child in illustrating the story of Clovis 
praying to the vision of his wife. Fig. 99 gives 
drawings by another child, showing a band of German 
warriors crossing a river. Fig. 100 shows completed 
drawings by four other children. 
In Grades VI and VII, children who have had a 
good deal of practice with free illustration during the 
primary grades, and with careful comparison of their 
own drawings with good figure drawings in the in- 
termediate grades, are able on the basis of this expe- 
rience to take up a more detailed study of the figure

than would otherwise be possible, even though the 
steps followed are similar to those followed in the 
intermediate grades. The children obtain a much 
more definite knowledge of form from them. 
This was the order of procedure. The children first 
planned their illustration by sketching the figures in 
skeleton lines to show the pose and action. When 
the results were reasonably good, they filled out these 
skeleton lines, making the shapes of the figures as 
satisfactory as they could. They then obtained added 
suggestions from the following sources; they them- 
selves took the position of one after another of the 
figures, in order to feel more vividly the action in- 
volved — this is a method often used by artists in 
their efforts to appreciate the action of particular fig- 
ures; they watched others who performed the actions 
necessary to the story, and got what data they could 
while the figures were in action, instead of having 
them hold one position which would indicate arrested 
action; to the suggestions obtained from these sources 
they added those from picture collections. 
On the basis of this new knowledge they drew an- 
other sketch, first arranging the position by means 
of skeleton lines and then completing the figures 
with as much significant detail as they could intro- 
duce. They noted those phases of the figure of which 
they were most ignorant, and made note of what 
they needed in order to improve their drawings.
-P-A-G-E-171

They chose good figure drawings from magazines 
or elsewhere which showed in detail’the points re-

sketched the skeleton lines of these from the pictures 
and filled out the details as completely as possible,

comparing their drawing with the picture at vari- 
ous stages. They then studied the appearance of 
certain parts of the body—for example, the head, 
hands, and feet—in different positions. Even in 
these grades it was often found that more rapid prog- 
ress was made, and greater freedom and skill to 
represent the figure easily and in various positions 
was obtained, from placing considerable emphasis

was less than that of the study of pictures. Fig. 101

Much is said regarding the drawing of the human 
figure as a means of training wsthetic appreciation. 
However this may be in the high school, it is fair 
to question whether children in elementary grades 
do not arrive more directly at appreciation of the 
wsthetic beauty of the body from artistic gymnastics, 
where they experience as well as see the motions, 
than from any attempts, which at this age must be 
crude, to represent the beauty of the figure. At its 
best, the figure drawing in elementary schools usu- 
ally results in somewhat of a caricature of the human 
form and is more valuable for its dramatic or story- 
telling use than as a means of developing esthetic 
sensibility. 
 
-P-A-G-E-175
  
CHAPTER III 
THE DRAWING OF CONSTRUCTED OBJECTS 
The various themes selected from the other sub- 
jects of the school curriculum call continually for 
drawings of constructed objects. These drawings 
necessitate ability to represent spatial relations cor- 
rectly and to picture various perspective effects of 
foreshortening, distance, etc. A large part of this 
ability can be developed sufficiently by the illustra- 
tive drawing. In nearly every grade, however, the 
questions of the children show that their perceptions 
of form and structure and perspective effects are 
growing clearer, and that their clearer perception 
awakens a desire to draw these items better. In the 
first three grades these questions refer mainly to 
the salient characteristics of objects; they are such 
questions as, ‘“ How do you draw a house?” “ How 
do you draw a table?” ete. Their remarks also in- 
dicate a desire to experiment; for instance, “I want 
to make my table red” or ‘‘May I have a blue 
wagon?” To someone who told a child that he 
should not have chosen a blue crayon with which 
to draw a chicken, because chickens were never of 
that color, he replied, “If you will ‘let me have the 
169  
-P-A-G-E-176
170 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
crayon, Ill show you how a chicken would look 
if it was blue.” They are satisfied at this time 
with very simple means of representing effects. 
In Grades IV and V the children are easily 
discouraged with their attempts to draw objects 
when they cannot represent the structure, or mate- 
rial, or proportions correctly. In Grades VI and 
VII they are not satisfied unless they can repre- 
sent the more detailed characteristics of individual 
objects and the pictorial effects of perspective. The 
beauty of form and proportion awakens a keen 
interest at this time. 
These interests are sufficiently strong to make the 
children very willing to stop the illustration of a 
theme in order to master a pictorial effect which 
presents difficulties. They will work upon one prob- 
lem for a considerable time with great enthusiasm, 
if the instruction offers steps which make their prog- 
ress evident to them. Ability to use these forms in 
Ulustrative work is the ultimate motive, but the sense 
of rapidly growing power furnishes a sufficiently 
strong immediate impulse. These are the occasions 
for drill, the occasions when certain effects can be 
mastered once for all and when skill is gained with 
greatest economy of time and effort. 
The following pages describe progressive steps 
planned to give children at different stages of school 
life the skill of which they feel the need. 
 
-P-A-G-E-177
  THE DRAWING OF CONSTRUCTED OBJECTS 171 
THE BEGINNINGS OF OBJECT DRAWING 
Grapgs I-III 
During the first three years in school the mini- 
mum amount of supplementary practice is needed. 
The children at this age draw mainly for the sake 
of. telling a story of action, and consequently the 
inanimate objects are useful only as suggestive 
material. Even in these grades, however, rapid 
progress is gained by devoting some time to the 
special study of object drawing. For example, in 
illustrating incidents of the school garden it became 
necessary to picture the hoe, spade, trowel, etc. The 
children first traced around the actual objects as they 
were held against the blackboard. Some then drew 
the shape full sized on the board, to see if they could 
produce one as good as the one traced, while others 
drew on paper at their desks. All then cut from 
paper the shapes of the garden implements. They 
then modeled these in clay, after which they made 
their final drawings. Fig. 105 shows a few of these. 
In another instance the illustrated theme called 
for a United States letter box. In most of the 
drawings, lines which should have been vertical 
were slanted. The children tried to show on the 
board how nearly vertical a post they could draw 
for the box and how well the upright lines of the 
box could be made to conform in direction to those

of the post. They then made cuttings from paper 
to show the proportions and shape of the box. These 
they took with them on the way home, in order 
to make comparisons with the actual mail box. 
When they returned, the shapes were discussed, and 
the children chose those which were most like the 
  Fig. 106. A Cuiip’s Successive Stupres oF THE SHAPE AND 
‘ Proportions oF A Lerrer Box 
proportions of the box as they remembered it. They 
then drew the box with what details they could 
recall and later compared these drawings with the 
box. These drawings were then exhibited and dis- 
cussed, after which each child made a final drawing 
and colored it with crayons. Fig. 106 shows the suc- 
cessive drawings of one child. Several other illus- 
trations, especially of houses, furniture, etc., called

for vertical lines. These were therefore emphasized, 
and by the end of the third year all the children 
could draw on the board a vertical line which would 
stand the test of a plumb line, and they took pride 
in making objects which should be vertical stand

exactly upright. This interest extended beyond the 
drawing and included the straightening up of columns 
of figures in arithmetic and of pictures on the walls, 
and even attention to their own positions when 
sitting or standing. Fig. 107 shows children drawing 
vertical and horizontal lines on the board.

  THE DRAWING OF CONSTRUCTED OBJECTS 175 
GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF APPEARANCE 
Grapes IV~-V 
A new interest becomes strikingly evident in 
Grade IV —an interest in representing the actual 
appearance of objects. In earlier years the children 
were pretty generally satisfied if a drawing was 
recognizable. Now they compare it more carefully 
with the object and demand that the picture con- 
form to a considerable degree to the appearance of 
the reality. In order to satisfy this demand of the 
growing perceptions, the drawing must be in good 
proportion and must represent the position of the 
object in space; how it is turned, tipped, ete. Sup- 
plementary drill on these matters at this time con- 
tributes to later freedom in drawing in much the 
same way as drill in the fundamental processes of 
arithmetic contributes to later facility in mathematics. 
A child in the seventh grade, hindered by inability to 
represent proportions easily, may be compared to a 
child in the same grade hindered in his advanced 
arithmetic by being unable to perform processes in 
addition easily. Examples of method in leading 
children to estimate and represent proportions cor- 
rectly are here given. 
In connection with science the children found it 
necessary to be able to sketch a jar. They studied 
it in the following order of steps. First they made 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
  176 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
a drawing directly from the jar. This was laid aside, 
and on another sheet of paper they placed four strips 
of paper or splints, which should represent the top 
and bottom and two sides of the jar, and moved 
these about in order to inclose the space which best 
represented the proportions of the jar. On another 
piece of paper they then drew lightly the top of the 
jar, and from this sketched the two sides lightly, 
making them of indefinite length. They then placed a 
splint or a piece of paper to represent the base, and 
moved this up and down in order better to judge the 
proportions. When they had thus found experimen- 
tally the shape that seemed to them to represent most, 
correctly the proportions of the jar, they sketched the 
outline of the objects and completed the drawing. 
In connection with the manual training it be- 
came necessary to draw some of the tools which were 
used; for example, a saw. The steps here followed 
were slightly different, not because the object itself 
was different, but in order to give the children 
another method of approach. On the drawing paper 
the children ‘indicated the length which they desired 
for the drawing. They then placed pieces of paper 
or splints which should represent the width and 
moved these back and forth until the space inclosed 
between the papers or splints and their previously 
noted indications of length seemed to them to 
represent the proportions of the saw. They then put
-P-A-G-E-183
THE DRAWING OF CONSTRUCTED OBJECTS 177 
the papers or splints aside and placed the pencil 
where they thought the handle should come. They 
then drew the top line of the blade, laid the pencil 
on the paper, showing where they would draw the 
lower line, and then sketched it in. Upon this plan 
they completed the drawing. 
In this work no use was made of the method of 
estimating proportions by holding the pencil at 
arms’ length and using it as a measure of width and 
height. This method substitutes the confirmation of 
a mathematical estimate for the immediate percep- 
tion of agreement or disagreement of the shape of the 
drawing with that of the object. Experience seems 
to prove that it is more difficult to teach elementary- 
school children to use pencil measurements in a way 
that is at all trustworthy, than to judge proportions 
as well without such measurements. Even when the 
children can make the measurements well these 
mechanical means hinder rather than promote ability 
in drawing. 
In addition to representing pictorially the propor- 
tions of objects, certain lines of work called for dia- 
grams and plans. For example, in preparation of the 
school gardens, in connection with natural science, it 
becomes necessary to draw the individual garden 
plots to scale. Lines of various lengths and slants 
“were placed upon the board, and these questions 
were asked : 
   
-P-A-G-E-184
178 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
1. On line 4, which represents the front and long side, 
complete free-hand the plan of a garden plot, the proportions 
of which are five feet long and three feet wide. 
2. Divide this plot from front to back into three sections 
which are respectively two feet and one and one-half feet wide. 
Such questions called for very definite visualization 
of relative proportions. 
Diagrams called for by arithmetic and geometry 
give abundant opportunity for this kind of estima- 
tion of proportions. For example, on the line A as 
a base construct free-hand an equilateral triangle ; 
on line B, an isosceles triangle, the altitude of 
which is three times the length of the base; etc. 
These diagrams are constructed on lines drawn on 
the blackboard or on paper. 
Drawing groups of two or three objects is another 
excellent problem in relative proportions. Experi- 
ments seemed to prove that the method of “ blocking 
in” the whole group in some general shape which 
touches the outside edges of each object as a spider’s 
web might if spun from one to another of the ex- 
treme outer projections of the group, and then finding 
the relative space which each object occupies within 
this, is helpful to adults, but seldom becomes a work- 
ing method for elementary-school children. They 
draw one object and then another until the group 
is completed. For example, in Grade VI, in connec-* 
tion with plant study, the children had occasion to
-P-A-G-E-185
  THE DRAWING OF CONSTRUCTED OBJECTS 179 
draw a geranium in a pot. If left to themselves, 
children almost always draw the pot so that its 
size is altogether too large for the plant. The chil- 
dren made a silhouette of the flowerpot in ink, and 
then showed with their fingers how large the plant 
should appear on the paper, and compared the space 
thus indicated with the size of the pot. After this 
  Fie. 108. A Cuitp’s Successive Steps iN Drawine A PLANT 
pause for comparison the relative size of the plant 
to the pot was fairly well represented. A number 
of drawings were then placed on exhibition, and 
the children decided which best represented the 
correct proportions. Fig. 108 shows these successive 
steps in drawing a plant. By such comparison as 
this the children learned more, readily to sketch 
proportions correctly than by attempting to ‘plan 
the whole form first and then subdividing: into the 
 
-P-A-G-E-186
  180 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
two areas of plant and flowerpot. It will generally 
be found that when the instructor, casting aside the 
traditions of the art school and the methods which 
the adult uses readily, will frankly accept the method 
natural to the children and will utilize its particular 
possibilities, good results will be speedily obtained. 
A problem which should be mastered in Grade VI 
is that of representing constructed objects as they 
appear in different positions. 
For example, in illustrating pioneer life the chil- 
dren wished to show utensils in use, but had diffi- 
culty in representing, for instance, a frying pan in 
any particular position. Each child drew as well 
as he could the frying pan as it would appear 
upon the stove. They then looked at two or three 
utensils of a shape similar to a frying pan, brought 
in from the domestic-science room and so placed 
that at least one could be seen by each child. They 
compared their own drawings with the appearance 
of the actual object, and improved these drawings 
as much as they could from the suggestions ob- 
tained from the object. They also collected pictures 
of utensils which furnished additional suggestions. 
They then made a sheet of smaller sketches in 
which they experimented in representing the frying 
pan in various positions. They discussed these, first, 
as to whether the drawing gave a correct idea of 
the position; and second, as to whether it looked

182 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
distorted or not. They appeared to learn more at 
first from a number of small drawings which allowed 
them to experiment with several positions than from 
one large drawing which attempted to represent the 
object in only one position. They soon learned to 
make fairly well-constructed shapes for use in their 
illustrations. A similar problem was presented by 
the drawing of a basket. Fig. 109 shows sheets of 
drawings of these objects in different positions. 
In representing dishes upon shelves it became 
necessary to understand the appearance of objects 
at different heights. Some of the children placed 
the tin cup used for holding water for water colors 
upon a pile of books on the desk and drew it as it 
appeared at that height. They then made successive 
drawings showing how it looked as one book at a 
time was removed and they could see farther and 
farther imto it at each lower level. Others of the 
children reversed this process, placing the cup first 
on the desk and then on a pile of books built up 
by adding one book after each drawing. These 
two sets of drawings were compared and discussed, 
first, as to whether they satisfactorily represented the 
cups at different levels; and second, as to whether 
the cups appeared to be perfectly round; in other 
words, as to whether the edge appeared as a circle 
seen at an angle or whether it appeared to be bent 
and irregular (Fig. 110).

-P-A-G-E-190
184 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
Cups were then placed on different desks at vari- 
ous levels, and each child marked the drawing upon 
his or his neighbor’s sheet of sketches which best 
represented the particular level of the cup at his 
desk. He then selected another drawing and tried 
to place the cup so it would be in the position repre- 
sented. These two steps stimulated observation in 
two ways: first, in choosing the drawing which con- 
formed to the appearance; and second, in males 
the appearance conform to the drawing. 
These experiments enabled the children to sketch 
general effects of different positions sufficiently well 
to serve the purposes of their illustrations. The 
knowledge and appreciation gained provided an ex- 
cellent foundation for the more detailed and elabo- 
rate study of rectilinear and curvilinear solidity 
which was taken up in the latter part of Grade VI 
and in Grade VII. 
RECTILINEAR OBJECTS 
Graves VI-VII 
If one examines sets of drawings of rectilinear 
objects, such as boxes, books, etc., made by children 
in the sixth and seventh years of school, he will find 
many which show such distortions as are indicated 
in Fig. 111. Two methods of correcting these are 
in common use. The one is to present a theory of 
 
-P-A-G-E-191
    THE DRAWING OF CONSTRUCTED OBJECTS 185 
perspective which explains what direction the lines 
should take in order to avoid these distortions. The 
second is to direct the children to careful observation 
of the objects as compared with their drawings, in 
order to discover where the difference lies. Results 
  Fig. 111. A Distortion Common in CurLpRen’s DRAWINGS OF 
ForesHorRTENED SURFACES 
justify us in concluding that neither of these methods 
has proved successful. Children appear to understand 
the theory of perspective and to be able to explain it 
and even to illustrate their explanations by means of 
diagrams. When it comes actually to changing their 
drawings by means of this theory they seem unable 
to make the application. The sight of the object puts 
out of mind the principles of the theory. Where good
-P-A-G-E-192
  186 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
drawing from objects has been attained in the course 
of this sort of teaching, it does not appear generally 
to be the result of it. 
The second method, namely, a close comparison 
of the drawing with the object, fails apparently be- 
cause when the child is comparing his drawing with 
the appearance of the object he is usually making a 
piecemeal comparison, and does not seem to be able to 
find exactly the fault with his production. He readily 
sees that his drawing does not look like the object, 
for instance, that the book in his drawing does not 
appear to lie as flat as the actual book, but he finds 
it difficult to know exactly how to change his draw- 
ing to give the appearance of the book. In order to 
do this he must have something besides a theory 
which appeals to his intellect, and an object which 
appeals to his eye. This necessary something, which 
neither of these means supplies, is a mental image so 
systematically and thoroughly developed that when 
he looks at his drawing it appears to be right or 
wrong as it conforms or fails to conform with this 
mental image. 
The following steps describe in detail a plan fol- 
lowed in developing visual knowledge of a rectan- 
gular solid. The steps were presented in such a way 
as to offer at various stages definite tests of the child’s 
progress. The illustrations for these steps (Figs. 111, 
112, and 114-123) show the successive drawings of

one of these children was absent, the work of an- 
other child of approximately the same degree of

  188 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
ability has been. substituted in the series. These 
substitutions are marked’ S. 
1. The children were asked to draw, without any 
help from the instructor, a book which was placed on 
a desk near by (Fig. 112). 
The instructor then held up two or three drawings 
of varying merit, which the children criticized in the 
light of these questions : 
a. Does the book in this drawing appear to lie flat on 
the desk ? 
6. Can you tell which lines should be changed in order to 
make the book look right ? 
Each child then criticized his own drawing in 
answer to these two questions. The value of these 
steps was in showing what the child was able to do 
as a result of his own observation. The instructor 
then led the children to select those lines which 
appeared to determine the direction of all the others. 
They found that if the position of three lines of any 
rectangular solid could be determined, the direction 
of the others could be estimated from these. The 
instructor then placed upon the board several exam- 
ples of these three key lines (see Fig. 113), and dif- 
ferent children came to the board and completed the 
outline of the solid on the basis of these lines. The 
children then criticized these drawings from the point 
of view of whether they gave the effect of rectangular 
solidity or appeared to be distorted.
-P-A-G-E-195
  THE DRAWING OF CONSTRUCTED OBJECTS 189 
2. Hectographed copies of three key lines were 
given out to each child. They were filled out by the 
children, who experimented in order to make the 
lines which they added conform to the given lines in 
such a way as to represent an undistorted rectangular

solid. While a large proportion of the children pro- 
duced distorted drawings in their sketch from the 
object, only three out of thirty-five produced distorted 
drawings in completing a drawing on the basis of the 
three given lines. The sheets of the four children are 
shown in Fig. 114. The children used rulers in this 
step, because by moving the ruler, they could experi- 
ment with the effects of lines at various slants, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-196

thus determine more easily their right relationship. 
After each child had made his drawing as nearly 
perfect as he was able, he exchanged drawings with

his neighbor and gave what suggestions he could. 
This gave each child the helpful experience of judg- 
ing drawings other than his own—an experience 
which is usually monopolized by the instructor.

3. The drawings of the previous lesson were again 
studied and discussed, in order to see if the children 
could further perfect them. Those which were still 
distorted were corrected by the children. Some chil- 
dren then went to the blackboard and sketched three 
key lines, upon the basis of which they completed a

their seats. By this means the relation of the struc- 
tural lines in a rectangular solid was thoroughly fixed 
in mind (Fig. 115). 
4. The children now made a drawing of the same 
book which had served as a model at first, placing it 
in the same position as before. This time the plan of 
structural lines which they had worked out in the 
intermediate steps exerted an evident influence upon
-P-A-G-E-198
  192 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
their drawings, as a result of which most of the distor- 
tions noted in Fig. 112 were not repeated. This time 
they were told that the drawing of the book must 
appear to lie flat, as did the book itself. The drawings 
made at first (Fig. 112) were distributed, and each child 
compared his latest drawing with them. The difference 
between the two was often so great that the children 
   Fig. 116. Seconp Drawrinas or Book FrRoM THE OBJECT 
were highly amused at their first drawings. It is im- 
portant to note that the higher standard of attain- 
ment was due more to developed knowledge of 
rectangular structure than to any increase of power 
resulting from direct observation of the object. 
Fig. 116 shows these second drawings of the book. 
5. The children now experimented with the effect 
produced by changing the angle of the key lines.
-P-A-G-E-199
THE DRAWING OF CONSTRUCTED OBJECTS 193 
The instructor first placed upon the board instances 
of the key lines at varying angles, and different chil- 
dren went to the board and filled out the figure by 
adding the necessary lines. They then discussed the 
effect of wide angles as compared with narrow ones.

narrow angles in changing the apparent position of 
the book, and conclusions were drawn as to just what 
changes made a book appear to lie more or less flat. 
The following questions were placed upon the board: 
a. How much change in angle of the key lines can you 
have and still represent something like a square box ? 
b. What is the effect of increasing this angle ? 
c. What is the effect of decreasing this angle ?
-P-A-G-E-200
  194 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
These questions were answered on a sheet of 
drawing paper by written statements illustrated by 
drawings. Examples of these drawings are shown 
in Fig. 117. 
6. A test was given in which the children spent 
five minutes in making from imagination a number 
of quick sketches of boxes at various angles. They 
first sketched the key lines at different angles and 
then added lines necessary to complete the effect 
consistently. Each child placed a book on the desk 
in front of him. He was then asked to look at the 
book and select from among the sketches which he 
had just made the one which was most like the book 
or the key lines of which were most like the key 
lines of the book. Each then made a sketch of the 
book he had been observing and tried to make the 
angle of divergence in his drawing as nearly as 
possible like the angle of the book. 
7. The children now made a drawing from an 
actual book, in order to show the exact position 
and proportions, which they were now able to repre- 
sent with some degree of accuracy because of their 
previous practice, and to show also its particular 
characteristics of binding, ete. The method of pro- 
cedure in this lesson was such as to review the 
principles of the previous lessons. For example, 
the children first sketched the key lines to show 
the position and proportion before completing the

book (Fig. 118). This was followed with a drawing 
of a group of books, one of which was lying open. 
This drawing involved the previous principles, applied

the children were shown examples of the artistic use 
of the line and were given some practice in drawing 
the sort of line which best brought out the desired

196 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
effect. Reproductions of excellent pencil drawings 
of books (for example, such drawings as those by 
James Hall in the Applied Arts Drawing Books) 
were passed around, in order that the children might 
obtain from them suggestions for better quality of 
line and methods of handling the pencil, and a little 
time was taken for pencil practice.

8. A book was placed above the level of the eye 
in sight of all the children, and they were asked 
to represent it in this position with no help or 
suggestion from the instructor. These drawings 
were then placed in sight of all the children and 
studied to see which of them gave the appearance 
of the book above the eye. The children were asked 
what direction the key lines must take in order to
-P-A-G-E-203
  
THE DRAWING OF CONSTRUCTED OBJECTS 197 
make the object appear as if it were above the level 
of the eye. A large proportion stated at once that 
the angle was merely the reverse of the angle which 
gave the effect of the object as below the level of 
the eye. The children then practiced with different 
angles of the key lines of objects above the level 
of the eye, to see the effect which resulted from 
modifying the angle, and added the lines necessary to 
represent the form of a house. They practiced draw- 
ing the shapes of houses as they would appear both 
above and below the level of the eye. They were 
taught how to find the perspective center of the end 
of the house in order to represent the gable correctly. 
This proved to be a point of very great interest to 
the children. The lines they had now learned gave 
them the clue for drawing blocks of houses and for 
modifying the simple house shape into various forms 
by the addition of ells, piazzas, ete. 
9. The following problem was written on the board, 
and the children worked from the specifications given : 
Draw a bird house as it would appear fifteen feet away, 
on a pole nine feet high, with a gable roof the eaves of which 
hang over the sides. The door is in the middle of the gable 
end. There is a shelf three inches wide extending around the 
base. The house is so placed that you can see the end and one 
side equally. Draw it first as it would appear when you look 
at it from the ground; second, as it would appear when you 
look down on it from a second-story window. 
Fig. 120 shows some of the resulting drawings.

10. So far the problems have dealt with objects 
either wholly above or wholly below the eye of the 
spectator. This problem was planned to lead the 
children to apply the knowledge they had gained 
from drawing objects in these two positions to an 
object so large that it extended both above and 
below the level of the eye on given key lines. They

were to make a rectangular box which was consider- 
ably above the level of the eye, and another at some 
distance below the level of the eye but directly 
under the first. They were then to experiment: in 
filling in the intervening space with other boxes, 
so that the final sketch would represent a single 
pile of rectangular boxes, of which the first two 
sketches formed the highest and lowest. From this
-P-A-G-E-206

they discovered the gradual change of angle which 
takes place as the position of the object passes from 
above the level of the eye through various stages to 
a position below (Fig. 121). . 
11. Pictures of buildings selected to show lines 
at various levels above and below the eye were then 
  Fie. 122. Drawincs snowinG Perspective or BurLpines 
given out. The children examined these to see if they 
could find in them any suggestions regarding the 
problem with which they had experimented in the 
previous lesson, or any corroboration of the solution 
which they had worked out. They sketched the key 
lines of these buildings, and then each completed a 
drawing of a building (Fig. 122).

CURVILINEAR OBJECTS 
—_—— 
The following steps present in detail the plan fol- 
lowed in developing a knowledge of curvilinear so- 
lidity. The principle followed here was the same as 
that observed in studying rectangular solidity; namely, 
that the appeal was made directly to the child’s per- 
ception of the object, and his drawing was judged in 
the light of this perception rather than by trying to 
make the drawing conform to a set of formulated 
principles. Fig. 126 illustrates the steps by the 
drawings of one of the best pupils. 
1. The first object selected as presenting a simple 
form of curvilinear solidity was a bowl. The children, 
without any previous instruction, first made a draw- 
ing of the bowl. Ten minutes was allowed for these 
drawings, and they were kept for comparison with 
later work (Fig. 126, A). The children studied 
these drawings and discussed the appearance of the 
mouth of the bowl. The chief point considered was 
whether the edge appeared to be the picture of a 
cirele in that position or whether it seemed to be 
distorted. 
2. The children soon saw the necessity of being 
able to draw the shape of an ellipse, which represents 
a foreshortened circle. Some time was then devoted 
to practice in drawing this shape. As the children 
progressed they gained an appreciation of the regular

-P-A-G-E-212
  206 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
variation in the curve and the beauty of its sweep. 
Considerable time was given to rapid, free drawing 
of the ellipse, and also to careful correction of one or 
two, in order to make them as good as possible. 
3. The children continued their study of the el- 
lipse. The work of the previous lesson was placed 
where all could see, and they discussed the ellipses 
shown. They then practiced on paper and at the 
blackboard in the drawing of ellipses of varying pro- 
portions, beginning with a circle and gradually de- 
creasing the width until the form became so narrow 
as to approach a straight line (Fig. 126, B). Each 
child then selected the ellipse which seemed to him 
to represent best the appearance of the mouth of the 
bowl as he saw it, and made a careful drawing of a 
single large ellipse of these proportions (Fig. 126, (). 
4. The children made a second drawing of the 
bowl under the same conditions which obtained when 
the first drawing was made. Each then compared his 
second drawing with his first (Fig. 126, D). The 
drawings were then placed where all could see, and 
the children discussed which was the best representa- 
tion of a circle viewed at an angle. They talked over 
the appearance of the circle in various positions. 
They then made from imagination several sketches 
of bowls, for the sake of experimenting with the dif- 
ferent effects produced by varying the curvature of 
the ellipse. The children then discussed how the 
 
-P-A-G-E-213
  THE DRAWING OF CONSTRUCTED OBJECTS 207 
bowl would appear if it were above the level of the 
eye, where they could not see into it, and made ex- 
perimental sketches to see if they could show the 
appearance of the top and also the bottom of the 
bowl, as seen above the level of the eye. The chil- 
dren talked over the effects produced by these differ- 
ent sketches and drew conclusions as to the results 
produced by changing the curvature of the ellipse. 
5. This step was devoted to practice, in order to 
make drawings of better technical quality. Repro- 
ductions of good pencil drawings were given to 
the children, and they studied them to see how the 
edge of a bowl was drawn so as to represent its thick- 
ness and how the pencil strokes showed the shape of 
the bowl and the characteristics of its structure. The 
children copied several drawings of objects, in order 
to make a more intimate study of the quality of line 
used by the skillful draftsman. They then made 
drawings of curvilinear objects (such as the teapot, 
cup and saucer, flowerpot, etc.), adding to their 
knowledge of how to represent different positions 
the technical suggestions gained from the-study of 
excellent drawings (Fig. 126, £). : 
As a final sheet the children made a careful draw- 
ing of a group of curvilinear objects. These were cor- 
rected and worked over until they were acceptable to 
the instructor. Part of the correction was carried on 
by having the children exchange drawings and give 
 
-P-A-G-E-214
    208 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
suggestions on each other’s work. After the draw- 
ings were acceptable, a tracing was made in order 
that the final outline might be transferred to a fresh 
  Fie. 127. Drawines snowing AveraGe CLass Work 
piece of paper. The children studied good decorative 
sketches of objects showing three values of light and 
dark. They then made small experimental sketches 
of their own groups of objects, trying the effect of 
three values of light and dark. They chose colors
-P-A-G-E-215
  THE DRAWING OF CONSTRUCTED OBJECTS 209 
which they thought would look well in representing 
their objects. Not more than three colors were al- 
lowed. They mixed these colors so as to give three 
values and painted their groups with these three 
tones (Fig. 126, 7). By these steps the majority of 
the children in the class learned how to represent 
correctly cylindrical and hemispherical shapes, so that 
their roundness did not appear to be distorted. They 
also learned what kinds of lines were used by good 
draftsmen in representing these effects, and how 
much of the effect of a good composition in light 
and dark could be obtained by translating the com- 
plex lights and darks of nature into three flat tones. 
A group of average drawings by other members of 
the class is shown in Fig. 127.

  CHAPTER IV 
INTERESTS AND STANDARDS OF ATTAINMENT 
The classification of interests and of standards of 
attainment here given has been made largely from 
observation of the sort of drawings which children 
preferred to make at different stages, the questions 
they asked indicating the kinds of information they 
desired, and also the degree of skill which could be 
economically attained and which was sufficient to sat- 
isfy their needs for expression in any given case. 
INTERESTS IN DRAWING 
The one great interest underlying all drawing 
from the first through the seventh grade is in sup- 
plementing what can be told by words with another 
interpretation of impressions ; namely, the unique way 
afforded by drawing, that is, by expressing the idea 
in terms directly suggested by the object itself. The 
more specific and incidental interests are given with 
the work of each grade. 
GRADE I 
1. The greatest interest in drawing displayed 
among first-grade children is the narrative or story- 
telling interest. There is an eagerness to tell the 
: 210 
 
-P-A-G-E-217
  INTERESTS IN DRAWING 211 
story through graphic symbols, the crudeness of which 
causes the children no dissatisfaction. The interest 
consists mainly in giving some sort of visible ex- 
pression to ideas, and not in the artistic excellence 
of the results. 
2. In this grade an interest in the appreciation of 
simple orderly and rhythmic arrangements of line 
and form becomes apparent. 
GRADE IT 
1. In the second grade the predominating interest 
is still narrative. There is more of a tendency here 
than in Grade I to question the likeness of symbols 
to the object represented in order to tell the story 
more adequately. 
2. The interest in representing more definitely 
particular objects and effects is increased during this 
year. For example, in making an illustration for 
some poem or story the narrative interest is some- 
times forgotten because of an absorbing interest in 
drawing in detail one of the objects in the picture. 
The wall paper, or a window, or any other feature 
of the illustration will often be worked upon to such 
an extent that it develops into the most prominent 
part of the picture, and the story to be told becomes 
incidental. 
3. There is an increased interest in good arrange- 
ment of line and form.
-P-A-G-E-218
212 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
GRADE III 
1. The interest here is still largely narrative, but 
the children of their own accord devote much more 
attention to making the drawing conform to the 
actual appearance of the object. 
2. A more definite interest arises in representing 
the characteristic details of objects and different 
effects of appearance. For example, there is pleas- 
ure in showing the characteristics of different birds 
of the same family, as the eagle, the hawk, etc.; or 
geographical landscapes involving different types of 
mountains or trees. 
3. An interest in representing certain geometric 
relations appears in this grade; that is, vertical, 
horizontal, and parallel. 
4. Considerable originality is shown in choosing 
orderly and rhythmic arrangements of lines and 
spaces and in inventing decorative units. 
_ GRADE IV 
In the fourth gris the interest in the correct- 
ness of representation is such that the children are 
no longer satisfied with their crude symbols. In 
other words, satisfaction is no longer found merely 
in the act of expression, however crude the symbols, 
but demands better results, even if to obtain these 
the rapidity of expression is checked. The interest 
 
-P-A-G-E-219
  INTERESTS IN DRAWING 213 
has swung from the mere activity of expression 
to the quality of the result that is to be secured. 
It has been found, however, that in fourth grades, 
where the children have accumulated a graphic 
vocabulary during the previous years, and have thus 
entered the grade with the ability to represent a 
certain number of forms with a fair degree of like- 
ness to the object, the interest in telling the story 
through drawing has not diminished. The attention 
to the quality of results does not check the narrative 
interest, provided the child has confidence in his skill 
to represent satisfactorily the necessary forms. 
Two interests, which contribute each to the other, 
develop along with the story-telling impulse. The 
first is In securing more exact and detailed repre- 
sentation of objects and effects of appearance. The 
second is an interest in conventions; that is, symbols 
used in a decorative way, such as would be worked 
out for materials which require a highly convention- 
alized design, as squared paper, weaving, etc. 
These two interests are necessary, one to the other. 
Art training is one-sided if either is emphasized to 
the neglect of the other. 
The specific ways in which these interests appear 
in this grade are as follows: 
1. In more detailed study of characteristics. 
2. In representing the appearance of objects in 
different positions.
-P-A-G-E-220
  214 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
3. In representing proportions and spatial relations 
correctly. 
4. In constructive and diagrammatic drawing of 
a simple sort. 
5. In conventionalization of familiar forms. 
6. In pleasing relations of lines and spaces. 
7. In a new style of technique, made possible 
through the use of water colors for the first time 
and in the suggestions which come from studying 
pictures to see how others have obtained effects. 
The interest in obtaining particular effects of fore- 
shortening and appearance in different positions is 
increased during this year. This results in experi- 
mentation in the drawing of objects and simple 
groups of objects, in order to learn how to produce 
these effects. Relative proportions and spatial rela- 
tions also become matters of interest. The use of 
water color increases the pleasure in representation. 
The interest in the decorative form as a single 
unit is extended to the translating of facts of form 
into decorative and symbolic conventions, where the 
influence of line and pattern is added to the expres- 
siveness of the content. 
There is an increased appreciation of geometric 
forms as absolute standards of spatial relations (for 
example, vertical, horizontal, etc.), and in patterns 
and plans as exact means of forecasting results in 
material and of describing forms and positions.
-P-A-G-E-221
INTERESTS IN DRAWING 215 
GRADE V 
In Grade V the dominating interests are the same 
as those found in the preceding year, except for the 
fact that they become wider and more inclusive as 
the general experience of the children is increased. 
The interest in the exact representation of objects, 
and in the decorative interpretations which almost 
always grow out of the power to draw forms well, 
expresses itself in the development of the ability to 
gather data and to learn methods by which impres- 
sions and ideas may be well expressed. For example, 
(1) individual topics are worked up with more per- 
sonal initiative, each child gathering the material 
which will enable him to make the best interpre- 
tation of the subject in which he is especially inter- 
ested. An interest in sketchbooks arises here which 
promotes the important use of drawing as a means 
of investigating and recording facts. (2) Class themes 
in connection with the various school subjects serve 
as centers of interest in collecting pictorial material. 
GRADE VI 
In the sixth grade the increasing power of percep- 
tion and appreciation awakens interest in aspects and 
methods which are somewhat new. There is a great: 
willingness to work for a considerable length of time 
and with a sustained purpose in order to secure the 
 
-P-A-G-E-222
216 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
exact result desired. Topics can be. undertaken where 
much planning of intermediate steps and preparation 
of material is necessary. There is a desire to under- 
take something worth while, or definitely connected 
with social activities. A decided interest is shown 
in exercising constructive imagination or inventive 
ability. There is interest in representing both the 
structure and beauty of form. 
In this grade there comes for the first time a very 
strong demand for more definite knowledge of how 
to represent rectilinear and curvilinear solids, or what 
is commonly termed perspective drawing of objects. 
While the interest in narrative drawing is as strong 
as in the lower grades, yet a great deal of attention 
is given to the exact drawing of each detail of 
composition. 
The interest in adapting the objects which they 
have drawn to decorative uses gives the children an 
increased enjoyment and appreciation of the good 
examples of design and composition which are used 
as reference material. It also results in discriminating 
criticism of the appropriateness and beauty of design 
in their immediate surroundings, and the children 
frequently report upon the good and bad points of 
the wall paper, rugs, book covers, and furniture found 
at home. One wall-paper dealer reported that parents 
were bringing their children to help them in the 
selection of good designs.

STANDARDS OF ATTAINMENT 217 
GRADE VII 
In the seventh grade the general nature of the 
interests continues along the same lines as in the 
previous year. The willingness to work for a great 
length of time in order to obtain a truthful represen- 
tation of facts for purposes of description or illustra- 
tion is increased. There is a still greater interest in 
form-building for purposes of construction or inven- 
tion. There is a growing desire to give a decorative 
interpretation to all the drawings, and a keener 
appreciation for beauty of form and color is dis- 
played. In this grade usually for the first time a 
genuine enjoyment of fine curves and graceful lines 
becomes evident. 
Considerable interest in the more formal side of 
art is apparent. The children are eager to work out 
a little of the theory of color and design in a very 
simple way. 
STANDARDS OF ATTAINMENT 
GRADE I 
I. An established habit of using drawing as a 
means of narrative expression, in which the drawings 
are allowed to remain largely pictographic in char- 
acter and serve to suggest ideas and to sustain the

  CHAPTER V 
CONCLUSIONS AS TO HOW CHILDREN LEARN 
TO DRAW 
The plan followed throughout the series of experi- 
mental lessons described in the preceding chapter was 
to use any means which enabled the children to draw 
freely and well, to watch for and follow up indica- 
tions of progress, and to keep detailed records of all 
the steps. 
An analysis of these records shows that three 
lines of method are prominent. 
1. The work was so presented that in each case 
the children drew for the sake of telling a story or 
of making arrangements of forms and lines and 
colors which they found to be pleasing in design. 
2. The children were taught how to supplement 
and enrich their own direct observation of objects, 
and to learn good methods of representing different 
effects and to become acquainted with excellent ex- 
amples of artistic style, by the use of reference 
material in the form of photographs, pictures, written 
descriptions, etc. 
3. The children systematically accumulated a 
graphic vocabulary consisting of forms which were 
231
-P-A-G-E-238
  232 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
most frequently used or which helped to interpret 
a wide range of other forms. 
In the course of the work certain facts became 
apparent which constituted the reasons for empha- 
sizing these lines of work. Three of these are here 
stated as the basis of a theory as to how children 
learn to draw, and are discussed in sufficient detail 
to show why the instructor used the particular 
methods of instruction that have been described. 
I. Interest in telling something is the motive which 
inspires all good drawing. This principle is generally 
accepted, and in most of the primary schools through- 
out the country it is in practical and successful opera- 
tion. Imaginative drawing or pictorial story-telling, 
commonly termed illustrative sketching, has largely 
taken the place of formal geometric and object draw- 
ing. As a consequence the majority of little children 
draw with enthusiasm and expressiveness. The ob- 
serving visitor to exhibitions of drawings by elemen- 
tary-school pupils is impressed by the confident, 
vigorous character of the illustrative drawings made 
by children in the first three grades. These qualities 
are so apparent as to lead one to conclude that if 
the same sort of instruction is continued until the 
end of the elementary-school course, drawing will 
become a common and effective means of expression 
for nearly all the children, and that the undisguised 
crudeness of technique of these early drawings is not 
 
-P-A-G-E-239
CONCLUSIONS 233 
a discouraging feature, but merely something which is 
inseparable from that stage of development and which 
will rapidly disappear under continued instruction. 
But when one passes on to the drawings by older 
children, he finds that this early promise is only 
occasionally fulfilled. Many of the’ children who 
were so eager to draw in the primary grades have 
become apathetic. The spontaneity so apparent in 
the free drawing of earlier years seems to disappear 
in considerable measure when children, at about the 
third or fourth year in school, discover how unlike 
the actual appearances of nature their drawings are, 
and what unlovely forms and crude pictorial compo- 
sitions they are producing. Why does not the early 
attitude of eagerness to use drawing continue more 
frequently than is the case? It is probably because 
a new kind of experience with things has developed 
and demands expression. Perception is growing clearer 
and calls for drawings which conform more closely to 
the new impressions from nature and to the higher 
standards of art than did the first crude scrawls. 
Children are no longer satisfied with the kind of 
drawings which they made during the first years in 
school, but their ability has seldom developed suffi- 
ciently to enable them to do much better. Conse- 
quently at the age of nine or ten years they are 
usually discouraged because their ability to draw does 
not develop as rapidly as their ability to see. 
 
-P-A-G-E-240
  234 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
This new demand, that the power to express shall 
in some measure keep pace with the growing power 
to perceive and to appreciate, needs to be satisfied. 
The mere presentation of interesting subjects to be 
rapidly illustrated by unskillful hands is no longer 
sufficient. ’ 
There are few instructors who do not recognize 
these new interests of perception and of esthetic 
appreciation and seriously attempt to meet them as 
they arise. Before children at this period of awaken- 
ing can illustrate different topics with drawings for 
which they themselves feel some respect, they must 
gain skill in representing shapes and proportions and 
perspective effects. Consequently nature drawing, ob- 
ject drawing, composition, and design are introduced 
as more or less isolated subjects; that is, as special 
work in drawing and only distantly associated with 
other subjects. It is easy to see how these topics 
tend to become self-centered and to shut out any 
story-telling interest comparable to that which in- 
spired the little children to spread rapidly upon the 
sheet of paper the stories of their experiences and 
imaginings and to hold up for our admiration the 
results, crude in themselves but remarkable in their 
power to suggest the movement and dramatic inci- 
dents of the narrative. 
Of course leaves and flowers, in whatever connec- 
tion they are presented, have their own charming

  CONCLUSIONS 235 
story of color and form, and we might argue that 
this, when added to the newly awakened interest in 
representing appearances, ought to compensate for 
the lack of narrative and to suffice. As a matter 
of fact, the representation of isolated things does 
not furnish an adequate motive for"children except 
for the few to whom form and color of themselves , 
make an unusually strong appeal and awaken a vivid 
inner experience. For these few, desirous to express 
what so strongly impresses them, ordinary nature 
and object drawing is sufficient, and they make 
excellent progress in it. These are the children 
with so-called “special talent.’ In most cases this 
type of talent in elementary schools appears to con- 
sist primarily in a special interest and not in a 
special endowment of skill. This interest is related 
to skill as cause to effect. In other words, if we can 
induce an equal interest on the part of other children 
they will develop equal skill. One of the significant 
facts brought out in the course of the work previously 
described is that not infrequently children who show 
under ordinary circumstances no indications of talent 
will, when the appeal to their particular interests is 
found, equal or surpass in skill those who appeared 
at first to be gifted artistically. It is interesting, also, 
to note that to some children the first real stimulus to 
skillful drawing came from the desire to impart some 
new intellectual discovery.
-P-A-G-E-242
  236 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
The impressions of form and color do not of them- 
selves offer a sufficient stimulus to the majority of 
children in the fourth and fifth years of school life, 
nor is the progress they are making in drawing al- 
ways sufficiently evident to them to supply the 
needed enthusiasm, although the incentive of evi- 
dently increasing power is at times a strong one. 
When a child finds he is actually mastering a par- 
ticular effect he will: sometimes forget the use to 
which he meant to put his drawing and will repeat 
the effect again and again, in order to enjoy the feel- 
ing of increasing ability and to assimilate it and 
make it permanently his own. A skillful instructor 
watches for these occasions and lets the children 
make the most of them. 
The interest in recording impressions of a particu- 
lar object must usually, for children at this age, be 
incidental to the appeal of some more general theme 
in which the particular object plays a part. For ex- 
ample, a child may find little to interest him in draw- 
ing a squash which is its own excuse for appearing in 
a particular drawing lesson, but is almost certain to 
be greatly interested if the squash is brought in as 
one of a series in connection with his nature study of 
the life history of a squash, in the course of which 
he has planted the seed, kept out the weeds, learned 
how to cultivate the vine and protect it from insects, 
and now to his book of sketches of the different 
 
-P-A-G-E-243
  
CONCLUSIONS 237 
stages is adding this of the successful consummation 
of his work. The illustrated history of the squash 
introduces the story-telling motive. Each separate 
drawing is one of a series and is necessary to the 
unfolding of the tale. 
In spite of the advantages of this interest, certain 
practical difficulties await one’s efforts to use it. 
Suppose one selects, for a topic in drawing, one of 
the current school subjects; let us say a subject in 
history; for instance, pioneer life. This immedi- 
ately calls for drawings of people, animals, landscape 
effects, wagons, log cabins, canal boats, ete. If a 
child has had no previous practice in drawing these 
things, the demands are too much for him. Either 
he must return to the crude sketches of the primary 
grades and thus violate his growing interest in ade- 
quate expression or so much time must be spent on 
mastering the various elements of his picture that 
the story interest is lost. Before the children can 
make drawings satisfactory to themselves, another 
history topic is taken up. Other subjects also clamor 
for illustration, and the drawing cannot keep pace 
with the calls made upon it. 
For this reason the instructor in drawing often 
fears that drawing will become simply the “ hand- 
maid of other subjects,” and he feels driven to 
arrange a systematic course, covering the general 
principles of drawing as a separate study, which the
-P-A-G-E-244
  238 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
grade teacher may or may not apply to daily inter- 
ests. He realizes that drawing has its own charac- 
teristic realm of subject matter and that it leads to 
certain unique experiences which every child should 
have. As a result we have courses in drawing which 
present a series of independent topics selected for the 
sake of cultivating skill and supposed to be used in 
connection with other interests after the power so 
to use them has already been developed in the time 
especially devoted to drawing. 
While this relationship of drawing to other school 
subjects is being discussed theoretically, in actual 
practice most of the difficulty disappears when those 
who have the work in charge have clear ideas regard- 
ing this question: What degree of skill in drawing 
at any given stage of school life will best serve the 
needs of expression at that time? Suggestions relat- 
ing to this question are given in the chapter on inter- 
ests and standards of attainment (pp. 210-230). With 
the character of these needs in mind the instructor can 
plan the technical progress which is necessary in order 
to provide an adequate vocabulary. He then finds 
little difficulty in illustrating a wide range of current 
topics without sacrificing progress in drawing as such. 
If the instructor chooses for drawing in Grade VI 
the subject in history just referred to, namely, pioneer 
life, and has no definite plan of progress in drawing 
through the grades, the class work is more than
-P-A-G-E-245
  
CONCLUSIONS 239 
likely to result in confusion. On the other hand, a 
teacher whose work is well planned knows which of 
the objects occurring in this illustration are new to 
the children and also what technical knowledge they 
need at this time. There has probably been already 
considerable study of people and animals and land- 
scape effects.. He may decide, therefore, to give 
these only incidental attention as elements in the 
composition and set the children to gathering data 
and studying the way to draw constructed objects, 
such as wagons, log cabins, or canal boats; or he may 
devote the time wholly to pictorial composition. 
Having selected one item for class study, such as 
log cabins, he will find that a somewhat thorough 
consideration of this one thing makes it a center of 
interest which stimulates the children to study the 
other related objects on their own account. 
These individual investigations may be so guided 
that in addition to the central topic of the log cabin 
each of the children will select a secondary one which 
he will contribute. One group will study the appro- 
priate animals, another the particular landscape 
effects of the country, etc. Group work of this type, 
where each child is contributing his part to a com- 
mon theme, utilizes to the full the story-telling inter- 
est and in addition usually produces greater actual

  240 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
progress in téchnical skill in portraying all the ob- 
jects involved than would have resulted if the whole 
time had been spent upon any one of them apart 
from its relation to a vitalizing theme. The story 
becomes a selective idea, enabling the children to 
choose from the infinite variety of possible aspects of 
each object those which they need. Moreover, the in- 
quiries which the children make at such times as to 
how to represent certain effects give the instructor 
the best indications of the standards of technical 
attainment which at that stage best serve their needs 
of expression. The instructor who knows what he 
wants to accomplish in any given year will have 
little difficulty in placing his emphasis in such a way 
that drawing which is used largely in close connec- 
tion with other school subjects will show progress 
just as systematic as can be brought about by any 
other method. 
Of course it is seldom possible to illustrate all the 
school subjects simultaneously. The instructor is 
compelled to choose. At times, also, when it is pos- 
sible to awaken interest in the acquirement of the 
skill to master some particular effect which may be 
assimilated once for all if drilled upon at that time 
and which will always be useful, he may make that 
the theme, as the teacher of mathematics tries at 
some time to have mastered, once for all, the funda- 
mental processes of number. He will find opportunity
-P-A-G-E-247
  
CONCLUSIONS 241 
to add to the study of almost every subject in the 
curriculum the particular kind of intellectual com- 
prehension and esthetic pleasure which drawing 
alone contributes, and at the same time he will com- 
plete his “course” with a success which would have 
been impossible if he had made it a special and 
isolated study, because the interest in telling some- 
thing will always be present. 
The reason for emphasizing the second line of 
work, namely, the study of pictures to supplement 
direct observation of objects and to show methods 
of drawing and examples of style and composition, 
is as follows: 
Il. Industrious drawing directly from objects, un- 
aided by other sorts of study and practice, has not 
proved to be the most effective way of learning to 
represent them. This is here stated negatively, be- 
cause the opposite is so often urged. On the positive 
side, one of the most important supplements to draw- 
ing from nature is the use of pictures as a source 
of information as to how things look and also as 
a means of learning good ways of drawing. 
The reaction from the time when all instruction 
in drawing was from copies has carried us too far 
in the other direction; namely, of supposing that the 
‘impressions we receive from objects at the moment 
when we are looking at them are sufficient to enabie 
us to draw them. It is pretty nearly true for all of us,
-P-A-G-E-248
  242 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
and almost absolutely true for children between the 
ages of seven and fifteen years, that people leaifn to 
draw, if at all, largely by aid of memories of the way 
others have drawn the things they themselves are 
attempting. For this reason a collection of pictorial 
reference material is a necessary part of the equip- 
ment in drawing. One who is learning to draw an 
animal, after he has made his first sketches, needs 
to see good drawings of animals in connection with 
his observation of the animal itself, in order that 
he may be helped to select out of the crowd of 
impressions which he receives from nature those 
which are useful for pictorial purposes. 
Copying, a means of close study which almost 
every art student uses at times, and even tracing, 
where the hand actually follows, and thus ex- 
periences the movement of, well-drawn lines, are 
important occasional aids to drawing. 
From drawings and photographs children can ob- 
tain a far wider range of facts for use in illustrating 
different. topics in history, geography, and literature 
than their direct observation of nature alone can 
afford. Children who are illustrating a topic, and who 
have been taught to handle reference material, will 
look over a pile of pictures and select facts of form or 
suggestions of action and composition which will enrich 
their illustrations. Now and then they will stop to 
make experimental sketches of effects they wish to use. 
 
-P-A-G-E-249
  
CONCLUSIONS 243 
Occasional copying of excellent drawings made 
in the mediums which the children are using will 
show them the possibilities and appropriate uses of 
lead pencil, water color, charcoal, ete. The ability of 
children to observe objects and to draw from them 
appears to be stimulated rather than hindered by a 
use of pictures such as is here suggested. One sig- 
nificant result is the confidence children gain by 
becoming able in this way to find out for themselves 
how to produce any desired effect. 
A question is often raised as to the effect on a 
child’s originality when his own ways of seeing 
and interpreting are modified by a study of the 
ways of others. This is comparable to asking, in 
the field of science, what effect it will have upon 
a student’s originality to reénforce his own seeing 
and describing of a flower or a stone by the seeing 
and interpreting of these objects which others have 
recorded in botany and geology. The description by 
another person sends one back to nature with a new 
capacity for analysis and appreciation. It is also 
true that one finds as much stimulus for originality 
in the study of the works of other people as in the 
study of the works of nature, and neither has its 
greatest value when considered alone. 
A phase of drawing which supplements direct 
drawing from objects and also the study of pictures, 
namely, memory drawing, needs consideration here. 
 
-P-A-G-E-250
244 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
In a sense, all drawing is memory drawing. It 
ranges from the brief momentary recollection of a 
child, hastening to put on paper the impressions of 
the previous instant before he shall forget them, 
to the compositions of a mature person, in which 
he sums up a long accumulation of memories. But 
it is all memory drawing. One cannot have his 
eye on the paper and the object at the same instant. 
Some interval must occur between the vision and the 
record. The length of the interval between seeing 
and recording determines to some extent whether 
this memory shall be superficial and fragmentary or 
shall involve’a broad mental reconstruction of the 
impressions received. Even the simple device of com- 
pelling children to pause an instant before recording 
what they see is of value. 
Small children relieve us of responsibility in this 
regard by taking the matter into their own hands. 
One who watches them sees that they seldom take 
seriously any instructions to observe closely the object 
which they are drawing. They give it a glance and 
proceed to draw out of their heads, influenced only 
in part by the object before them. When it first 
became our custom as teachers to “ 
draw from their imaginations, it was probably rather allow” them to 
a matter of resignation to the inevitable than of 
principle on our part. Moreover, at an age when.a 
row of chairs will serve as a train of cars or a dark

CONCLUSIONS 245 
corner of a room as a cave, the pictographs which 
children draw answer sufficiently well if they serve 
to recall the thought in mind, even if they do not 
represent the actual object. 
With older children it is different. Their percep- 
tions have developed to a point where they reject 
any representation which does not conform in some 
degree to actual appearances. The danger is that, 
notwithstanding instruction to the contrary, they 
will isolate details and record them in succession 
with little effort at seeing the subject as a whole. 
Many instructors make a sincere effort to train pupils 
to see comprehensively by mapping, or “ blocking in,” 
the whole object or group with light lines first and 
then placing the details within this plan in proper 
relation to the whole. This method, which is of great 
value to the mature student, appears to be of little 
practical advantage in elementary schools. Of course 
the test is whether or not the children actually adopt 
it as a way of working. If we watch them when 
left wholly to themselves, we see that they almost: 
always return to the addition-of-piece-to-piece proce- 
dure. Some more vital method of synthesis appears 
to be required. Only in drawing from imagination 
and from memory are children likely to make a draw- 
ing which is an organic whole. Sheer industry in re- 
cording immediate sensations and impressions seldom 
develops ability to draw well.  
-P-A-G-E-252
246 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
If one alternates the drawing of an object from 
memory with drawing it from direct observation, he 
realizes how much each of these methods helps the 
other. In drawing from memory the child weaves 
together all his knowledge of an object into a co- 
herent whole, and when he then returns to drawing 
from the object, he gathers data with more discrimi- 
nation because the memory drawing has made him 
realize the gaps in his knowledge. These data he 
retains in mind to a greater degree than he other- 
wise would, and consequently is able to use them in 
his next drawing from memory. The mental image 
forced into clearness by the memory drawing gives 
a new coherence to the impressions which the child 
receives from the object when next he sees it with 
all its details. This is a lesson which many an art 
student, discouraged by the failure of industrious 
academic practice to give him ability in pictorial ex- 
pression, has discovered, and it is one which we who 
would advance drawing in elementary schools must 
take to heart. 
When the story-telling interest is present, drawing 
from objects, the study of pictures, and drawing from 
memory and imagination become mutually reénfore-- 
ing to the highest degree. If a child in Grade VII 
is to illustrate a topic in geography, for instance, 
Holland (see pp. 96-103 for a somewhat similar treat- 
ment of other topics), the making of a sketch in
-P-A-G-E-253
CONCLUSIONS 247 
which he puts down what ideas he has, however 
meager and crudely expressed they may be, is the 
best preparatory step for further study. He knows 
now what information he needs, and proceeds directly 
to the sources from which he can obtain it. Each 
time he rearranges his picture he assimilates facts 
and suggestions already acquired, and quickens his 
appetite for more. Material thus obtained is likely to 
be permanently retained in mind. 
An important fact which became apparent in the 
course of the work, and which is one reason why 
so much time was spent in the somewhat mechani- 
cally thorough study of a few selected forms, is the 
following: 
Ill. Progress in ability to draw is not general but 
specific. Increase in ability to draw means increase 
in ability to draw those particular things upon which 
one has been practicing. It does not apply equally to 
drawing other things, except in so far as the things _ 
one has learned to draw have characteristics in com- 
mon with these other things. In other words, increase 
in ability to draw birds may not imply a correspond- 
ing increase in ability to draw trees. We often hear it 
said that this person can draw or that person cannot 
draw. Children and artists are usually more specific. 
The child says, “I can draw a boat, but I cannot 
draw a house.” The statements of the artist are 
likely to be equally definite. An excellent portrait
-P-A-G-E-254
ee 
248 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
painter will often hesitate to undertake a landscape 
without special practice in that line. A good land- 
scape painter may fail in attempting to paint still 
life. In drawing, as in any other language, one ac- 
cumulates a vocabulary within the limits of which 
he can converse. 
The relation of this fact to methods of teaching 
drawing is evident. The children must be aided in 
building up a graphic vocabulary which is completely 
at their command. If this vocabulary is wisely se- 
lected, even if it is small it will still give the chil- 
dren a considerable range of expression and a clue to 
the way to draw many associated objects which they 
have not studied so thoroughly. 
To add any given form to their graphic vocabulary 
in the sense here intended, the children must gain a 
much more thorough mastery of it than will come 
from the making of two or three sketches. For ex- 
ample, suppose that one of the topics decided upon 
is a bird. Instead of drawing different birds succes- 
sively, the children should learn one bird shape so 
thoroughly that they can draw it from memory with 
perfect confidence. Occasionally, even in the case of 
small children, this knowledge may be secured by 
alternating memory drawing with reference to the - 
actual bird for data. Usually, however, it is neces- 
sary, especially at the first, to resort to a literal re- 
production of a single form, the appearance of which ,
-P-A-G-E-255
  CONCLUSIONS 249 
in one position has been committed to memory. The 
simplest material is a hectographed outline of the bird, 
from which the child traces, cuts out the shape, 
draws, and repeats, and thus learns it in a manner 
as mechanical and as thorough as that by which he 
learns the form of a letter. It is here that the artis- 
tically trained teacher of drawing is tempted to 
protest and raise some significant questions: for 
example, Will not such mechanical and formal ex- 
perience destroy any spontaneity? And will not all 
birds thereafter be drawn according to this memo- 
rized symbol? Actual schoolroom experience shows 
that the opposite is true. The results answer these 
two questions specifically. 
First, after a form is once learned with sufficient 
thoroughness, children proceed at once to vary its 
pose and action, but they show in making these vari- 
ations the confidence and skill gained from the first 
presentation. In one case a teacher engaged in the 
experiment taught a first-grade class the form of a 
frog, which was needed in a story illustration. This 
form was particularly difficult. The children could 
get little from the object or from pictures. The in- 
structor worked on the form in one position, teach- 
ing line by line from a hectographed outline for two 
weeks. Meanwhile someone skilled in drawing made 
sketches of frogs from time to time on the black- 
board. When at length the children succeeded in 
 
-P-A-G-E-256
  250 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
learning the form, they seemed suddenly to clothe it 
with vitality, and, with great enthusiasm, drew frogs 
in various positions. When once this first image was 
clearly in mind it.proved to be a framework to which 
the children readily added new data obtained from 
pictures and from nature—data they were appar- 
ently unable to assimilate before. The memorized 
image became the starting point for a greater and 
more persistent spontaneity than could be obtained 
by any other methods. <A description in detail of the 
steps by which another form was acquired is given 
on pages 117-120. 
Second, children who, by detailed study, had ac- 
quired a definite image of one bird in a single posi- 
tion found this image to be a center of reference and 
comparison when they saw other birds and other 
positions. Because of it, they were able to see vari- 
ations more clearly, and the results when they drew 
birds of a different species were less like a conven-— 
tional symbol than were those of children not 
equipped with some such clear-cut mental image 
of a particular form for reference. 
When a mental picture of some one thing has been 
developed so clearly and concretely that it can be 
drawn confidently and with little effort, as a well- 
known word can be written or melody sung or 
stanza repeated, it becomes an interpretative image ; 
a means of understanding other forms which are

CONCLUSIONS 251 
more or less similar. If a child who has had no pre- 
vious training in learning thoroughly one bird form 
is asked to draw from nature birds of different kinds, 
he will perceive the differences in a general way. 
But if one specific bird shape has been well mastered 
and assimilated, it acts as a pattern to which he 
refers other bird forms. There appears to be a keener 
perception not only of points of similarity between 
the new form and the shape he remembers but also 
of variations from that shape. In other words, the 
individual characteristics of a new bird form are ex- 
pressed with greater, and not with less, discrimination. 
Curiously enough, children from five to seven years 
of age, whose drawing is of the crude hieroglyphic 
type, are especially interested in these detailed steps _ 
by which a form is learned and appear to welcome 
and find delight in the resulting clarification of a few 
mental images. Without interrupting the free spon- 
taneous story-telling, these clear and carefully built- 
up mental images reénforce with Ss data their 
indefinite ideas of form. 
In the detailed steps described on pages 117-120, it 
will be noted that the first work is in outline rather 
than mass. Drawing in mass is widely recommended 
as the most natural first step because the actual im- 
pression which one receives from an object, say a leaf 
or a fruit, is of a mass of color and not of a defined 
outline. Representation in mass, however, is probably 
   
-P-A-G-E-258
  252 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
not natural in the sense that it is the most direct 
expression of a child’s interest in an object. His in- 
terest appears to be not actually to reproduce all his 
impressions of an object just as they come to him, 
but to find some convenient means of simplifying those 
impressions, some way of disengaging the object 
from its confusing surroundings and emphasizing a 
few of the many sensations it gives him. 
Outline drawing is one of the most direct methods 
of isolating and simplifying the form of an object. 
One has only to watch the drawing of children to 
discover how seldom they will, of their own accord, 
use mass drawing as the first step in describing ob- 
jects. Even when urged to draw in mass and pro- 
vided with brush and color as the appropriate means, 
they almost invariably sketch the outline first and 
then fill it in. To fill in an outline already made 
interests them greatly, but they insist upon the out- 
line as the first step in defining an object and as 
preliminary to any other processes of representation. 
When the shape of some one thing has been 
thoroughly learned, so that the children know it by 
heart and can reproduce it with facility, the following 
results are usually evident : 
First, they feel increased confidence in their ability 
to draw. If they can learn to draw one thing, why 
not another? Steps so definite and drill so -thor- 
ough have something in common with exercises in
-P-A-G-E-259
  CONCLUSIONS 253 
learning to write a given word. Every child produces 
some passable result. In the primary grades, as has 
been already remarked, this work, when supplemen- 
tary to their free pictorial story-telling, is usually 
attended with great interest on the part of the chil- 
dren. They come to the later grades with consider- 
able confidence in being able to learn to draw any 
given object. They have also the attitude of mind 
that drawing, like other subjects, is mastered by 
systematic study. 
There is also a second result of memorizing forms, 
which has a particularly important influence upon 
the study of design and the development of artistic 
appreciation. When a form is thoroughly learned, 
children delight to draw it repeatedly for the fasci- 
nation of seeing it grow under their hands and for 
the stimulating sense of rapidly increasing skill. 
They will draw it in school and out. Sometimes 
they will make long rows or surface patterns of ani- 
mals or birds or objects which they are learning to 
draw. This playful repetition of forms not only im- 
parts to the child’s pictorial expression a degree of 
facility which could hardly be developed in any other 
way, but it also leads children by a natural path to 
certain realms of design the approach to which with- 
out this experience in mastering appearances is likely 
to be somewhat artificial. Their own drawing helps 
to explain to them many historic forms of design.
-P-A-G-E-260
254 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
When one repeats a form frequently, that form 
tends to acquire a style usually more or less decora- 
tive in character and expressive of the individuality 
of the person. Handwriting is a good example of 
this. Students of the history of design find that 
many apparently abstract decorative forms have re- 
sulted from continual repetition of what was once a 
pictorial representation. It is true that design has 
other important sources, such as the arrangement of 
geometric shapes and other abstract forms and the 
modification of structural elements of objects. Nev- 
ertheless, this evolution of pictorial drawings into 
forms whose charm is preéminently decorative makes 
a unique contribution to one’s artistic appreciation. 
Sometimes, as in certain primitive tribal designs 
where many individuals have worked over the same 
subject, the forms become so abstract that the origi- 
nal pictorial appearance is quite lost.1_ In other cases, 
as, for instance, in the work of Corot, the early 
labored and. literal work develops. into a style the 
decorative quality of which is so intimately bound 
up with the pictorial significance that it sometimes 
escapes notice at first. 
A style thus developed has elements begotten of 
the personality of the producer and of the signifi- 
cance of the subject which are more evident than is 
the case when a decorative convention is consciously

CONCLUSIONS 255 
adopted. Someone has expressed the same idea in the 
realm of literature by saying that poetry demands 
not only meters but meter-compelling ideas. 
Because one has repeatedly drawn pictorial forms 
until they have become conventionalized and bear 
the impress of his individuality as plainly as his 
handwriting, it does not therefore follow that the 
style he evolves by his own effort is artistically 
good. He needs continually the suggestion and in- 
spiration of excellent examples. Nevertheless, we can 
readily see the difference between the experience of 
a child who is given some distinct style of decorative 
interpretation which he is to apply to a form which 
he can draw only fairly well and the experience of 
a child who is urged by his knowledge of, and pleas- 
ure in, a form to repeat it until it attains that 
abstraction and formal consistency which inevitably 
results from playful repetition. When at different 
stages of his experimentation he is made familiar 
with fine examples of design, he is likely to adopt 
and assimilate readily those decorative conventions 
which best accord with and express the esthetic 
mood into which his own experimentation is lead- 
ing him. His artistic expression is influenced by the 
good examples which he sees, yet it retains a unique 
element of spontaneity. One of the most interesting 
fields of investigation open to teachers of design is 
that of noting the stages by which an oft-repeated
-P-A-G-E-262
  256 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
and well-understood drawing tends to assume rhythmic 
and decorative forms. 
The foregoing considerations are not at all intended 
to minimize the great value of practice with the more 
purely xsthetic elements of design, but to emphasize 
the truth that a painstaking study of facts not only 
is not necessarily antagonistic to wsthetic develop- 
ment but, on the contrary, is the natural, and has 
been the historical, pathway to one of the major 
realms of wsthetic expression. 
An instructor who plans a graphic vocabulary 
faces at once the practical question of its nature 
and range. It would be a hopeless and useless task 
to attempt to learn with the degree of thoroughness 
here suggested any large number of forms. If the 
instructor, in making a selection, chooses those things 
which, when well understood, interpret and make easy 
a wide range of others, he thus builds up a vocabu- 
lary of most frequently recurring, or of most widely 
interpretative, forms. This was the idea which several 
years ago made almost universal the study of the 
principles involved in the geometric solids —the 
sphere, cylinder, and cube. Under these types or 
combinations and modifications of them the shapes 
of a large proportion of objects, organic as well as 
constructed, could be classified. It was therefore said 
that if one learned to draw these forms he was learn- 
ing to draw a wide range of related objects, This  
-P-A-G-E-263
  
CONCLUSIONS 257 
plan often worked successfully with mature students 
but very seldom in the case of elementary-school 
children. The reason for its failure with children 
lies in the fact that it presented principles to be 
logically applied, instead of developing perceptions 
or mental images as a means of direct interpretation. 
The idea of using type forms was excellent. The 
mistake lay in not using them as interpretative 
images; that is, as a means of quickening one’s 
power to draw related forms so that they would 
look right. The description of an experiment in 
using rectangular solids as a means of perceptive, 
instead of logical, approach to the drawing of houses, 
boxes, chairs, and other rectilinear forms is described 
on pages 184-208. 
What types should constitute the graphic vo- 
cabulary the images of which are to be built up 
systematically ? In making his selection the instruc- 
tor in drawing must have in mind the general field 
which he wishes to cover during the entire course 
and select for study a few things which will interpret 
wide ranges of form. These selected things should 
be learned, reviewed, and fixed in much the same 
way as the teacher of language establishes a well- 
chosen vocabulary. When he has decided upon the 
general type of topics needed, the themes for illus- 
tration which occur in connection with other subjects 
of the cwriculum will readily suggest particular  
-P-A-G-E-264
  258 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
objects. In the experimental lessons described in 
this book, the following topics proved of value in 
interpreting the more important visible forms: 
1. Organic forms: two or three bird and animal forms, and 
two or three plant forms. 
2. Geographical forms: mountain, plain, river, etc. 
3. Constructed forms involving rectangular and curvilinear 
solidity. 
4. A few of the simpler geometric forms and relations. 
5. A few examples of good composition. 
Until one has watched carefully the intellectual 
processes involved in drawing, he does not realize 
how dependent we are, in almost every case, upon 
our memories of similar forms as a means of ana- 
lyzing what we see, even when we appear to be 
directly recording the impressions of the form before 
us. If there is any case in which this reliance upon 
memories of form would seem to be unnecessary, it 
is when one is merely mapping out the general shape 
of objects. A person with good judgment of pro- 
portions might be expected to draw with fair correct- 
ness the main contours of any object which might 
be presented, whether he had had previous-experience 
with it or not. This delineation of the general pro- 
portions is not usually regarded as demanding any 
developed concept as a basis for progress. It is 
supposed to be a direct copying of form, since, it 
is argued, no previous idea of the object is necessary 
 
-P-A-G-E-265
  
CONCLUSIONS 259 
in order to decide upon the slant of any one of its 
edges or the relative height and width of its shape. 
Here the impressions of the moment appear to furnish 
all the data, and therefore one naturally supposes 
that only direct, industrious practice can overcome 
the difficulty involved in representing shapes cor- 
rectly. This ability to sketch the general shape of 
any object which may be presented is probably what 
is in mind when one speaks of a skill in drawing 
which is of universal application and based upon 
no specific memories. 
This fallacy is responsible for much of the lack 
of ability on the part of children in upper elementary 
grades and in high schools to represent ordinary pro- 
portions and shapes easily and correctly. As a person 
examines his own mental process, he finds that when 
he begins to study a shape, it soon relates itself to, 
or resolves itself into, certain geometric elements; as 
when a map of a continent begins to suggest perhaps 
a triangle or a combination of geometric figures which 
give the key to its delineation, or when he finds 
himself comparing slanting lines with an imaginary 
vertical or horizontal. This kind of analysis soon 
offers to him hints of ways in which he can tran- 
scribe the form. The accuracy of the slant depends 
to a large degree upon the accuracy of his mental 
image of vertical or horizontal, with which he 
compares it. His ability to represent the main
-P-A-G-E-266
  260 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
proportions correctly depends largely upon his ability 
in triangulation. Consequently the definiteness with 
which certain geometric concepts have been estab- 
lished determines to a great extent his ability to 
represent any shape. What is usually regarded as 
general ability to draw, means ability to represent 
the mere spatial relationships of any object, and this 
in turn depends upon specific training in certain 
fundamental geometric relations. Indeed it is fre- 
quently found that a child who is unable to represent 
objects in good proportion will gain more by turning 
from his object drawing to a few exercises in repre- 
senting specified geometric relations, such as the 
drawing of geometric figures from given dimensions, 
than in weeks of industrious practice with objects. 
In so far as the experiments recorded in the 
previous chapters can serve as a basis for a theory 
of method which shall make drawing a profitable, 
stimulating, and generally used medium of expression 
in elementary schools, the principles of that theory 
may be summed up as follows: Children draw well 
only when they wish to tell some specific thing by 
their drawing. They should be trained to explore 
not only nature but also pictorial material as sources 
of reference from which to obtain data and methods 
for telling what they wish. Incidentally this experi- 
ence gives them considerable independence; they 
can learn by themselves how to draw new things.
-P-A-G-E-267
  CONCLUSIONS 261 
As supplementary work, a carefully selected graphic 
vocabulary should be systematically accumulated. 
A discussion of the training of the teacher who 
presents drawing is not one of the purposes of this 
book. However, it is worth while to say here that 
the grade teacher as well as the special teacher 
should be able to draw; not necessarily to draw 
as an artist, but to draw well. She should at least 
know how to draw certain things connected with 
her teaching. In other words, she should have a 
somewhat definite graphic vocabulary of her own. 
While mastery of one’s subject is as important 
in drawing as in other fields, it is still a significant 
fact that a moderate degree of ability to draw plus 
a high degree of teaching ability and educational 
insight on the part of the instructor will often bring 
better results in elementary schools than will unusual 
artistic skill with a less degree of skill in teaching. 
To state this more specifically, a successful grade 
teacher with a liking for drawing which leads him 
to specialize in that subject will @ften—develep a 
higher degree of appreciation on the part of the 
children than will a highly talented person with 
little skill in teaching. Perhaps this is because he 
knows by personal experience the steps by which a 
person of average ability learns how to draw. Of 
course the ideal is found in the instructor who pos- 
sesses skill in both fields. The value of drawing  
-P-A-G-E-268
  262 HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW 
for and with the children is inestimable. The example 
of the instructor will always be an important element 
in good methods of instruction. The actual demon- 
stration exerts a contagious influence upon children 
and gives the maximum of force to the impulse of 
their imitating minds. Actual classroom experiences 
abundantly justify a confidence on the part of all 
instructors, special and general, that the same sound 
methods and stimulating personality that bring suc- 
cess in other studies will be equally effective in the 
case of drawing.

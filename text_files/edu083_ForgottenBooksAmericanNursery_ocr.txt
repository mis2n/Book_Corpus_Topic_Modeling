CHAPTER I 
Introduétory 
a full of books belonging to the American 
children of colonial times and of the early days of the 
Republic presents a strangely unfamiliar and curious appear- 
ance. If chronologically placed, the earliest coverless chap- 
books are hardly noticeable next to their immediate suc- 
cessors with wooden sides; and these, in turn, are dominated 
by the gilt, silver, and many colored bindings of diminutive 
dimensions which hold the stories dear to the childish heart 
from Revolutionary days to the beginning of the nineteenth 
century. Then bright blue, salmon, yellow, and marbled paper 
covers make a vivid display which, as the century grows older, 
fades into the sad-colored cloth bindings thought adapted to 
many children’s books of its second quarter. 
An examination of their contents shows them to be equally 
foreign to present day ideas as to the desirable characteristics 
for children’s literature. Yet the crooked black type and crude 
illustrations of the wholly religious episodes related in the 
oldest volumes on the shelf, the didactic and moral stories 
with their tiny type-metal, wood, and copper-plate pictures of 
the next groups; and the “improving” American tales adorned 
with blurred colored engravings, or stiff steel and wood illus- 
trations, that were produced for juvenile amusement in the 
early part of the nineteenth century, —all are as interesting

to the lover of children as they are unattractive to the modern 
children themselves. The little ones very naturally find the 
stilted language of these old stories unintelligible and the 
artificial plots bewildering; but to one interested in the adult 
literature of the same periods of history an acquaintance with 
these amusement books of past generations has a peculiar 
charm and value of its own. They then become not merely curi- 
osities, but the means of tracing the evolution of an American 
literature for children. 
To the student desiring an intimate acquaintance with any 
civilized people, its lighter literature is always a great aid to 
personal research; the more trivial, the more detailed, the 
greater the worth to the investigator are these pen-pictures 
as records of the nation he wishes to know. Something of this 
value have the story-books of old-fashioned childhood. Trivial 
as they undoubtedly are, they nevertheless often contain our 
best sketches of child-life in the eighteenth and early nine- 
teenth centuries,—a life as different from that of a twentieth 
century child as was the adult society of those old days from 
that of the present time. They also enable us to mark as is 
possible in no other way, the gradual development of a body 
of writing which, though lagging much behind the adult 
literature, was yet also affected by the local and social condi- 
tions in America. 
Without attempting to give the history of the evolution 
of the A B C book in England—the legitimate ancestor 
of all juvenile books—two main topics must be briefly dis- 
cussed before entering upon the proper matter of this volume. 
The first relates to the family life in the early days of the 
[4]
-P-A-G-E-15
American Nursery 
Massachusetts Commonwealth, the province that produced 
the first juvenile book. The second topic has to do with the 
literature thought suitable for children in those early Puritan 
days. These two subjects are closely related, the second being 
dependent upon the first. Both are necessary to the history 
of these quaint toy volumes, whose stories lack much mean- 
ing unless the conditions of life and literature preceding them 
are understood. 
When the Pilgrim Fathers, seeking freedom of faith, 
founded their first settlements in the new country, one of their 
earliest efforts was directed toward firmly establishing their 
own religion. This, though nominally free, was eventually, 
under the Mathers, to become a theocracy as intolerant as that 
faith from which they had fled. The rocks upon which this 
religion was builded were the Bible and the Catechism. In this 
history of toy-books the catechism is, however, perhaps almost 
the more important to consider, for it was a product of the 
times, and regarded as indispensable to the proper training 
of a family. 
The Puritan conception of life, as an error to be rectified 
by suffering rather than as a joy to be accepted with thanks- 
giving, made the preparation for death and the dreadful Day 
of Judgment the chief end of existence. The catechism, 
therefore, with its fear-inspiring description of Hell and the 
consequences of sin, became inevitably the chief means of 
instructing children in the knowledge of their sinful inherit- 
ance. In order to insure a supply of catechisms, it was voted 
by the members of the company in sixteen hundred and 
twenty-nine, when preparing to emigrate, to expend “3 shil- 
151
-P-A-G-E-16
  
  Forgotten Books of the 
lings for 2 dussen and ten catechismes.”* A contract was also 
made in the same year with “sundry intended ministers for 
catechising, as also in teaching, or causing to be taught the 
Companyes servants & their children, as also the salvages and 
their children.” + Parents, especially the mothers, were contin- 
ually exhorted in sermons preached for a century after the 
founding of the colony, to catechize the children every day, 
“that,” said Cotton Mather, “you may be continually drop- 
ping something of the Cazech’sm upon them: Some Honey 
out of the Rock”! Indeed, the learned divine seems to have 
regarded it as a soothing and toothsome morsel, for he even 
imagined that the children cried for it continuously, saying: 
“O our dear Parents, Acquaint us with the Great God... . Let us 
not go from your Tender Knees, down to the Place of Dragons. 
Oh! not Parents, but Ostréches: Not Parents, but Prodigies.” t 
Much dissension soon arose among the ministers of the 
settlements as to which catechism should be taught. As the 
result of the discussion the “General Corte,” which met in 
sixteen hundred and forty-one, “desired that the elders would 
make a catechism for che énstrutiton of youth in the grounds of 
religion.” § 
To meet this request, several clergymen immediately re- 
sponded. Among them was John Cotton, who presumably 
prepared a small volume which was entitled “ Milk for Babes. 
Drawn out of the Breast of Both Testaments. Chiefly for the 
spiritual nourishment of Boston Babes in either England: But 
may be of like use for any children.” For the present purpose

the importance of this little book lies in the supposition that 
it was printed at Cambridge, by Daye, between sixteen hun- 
dred and forty-one and sixteen hundred and forty-five, and 
therefore was the first book of any kind written and printed 
in America for children; —an importance altogether different 
from that attached to it by the author’s grandson, Cotton 
Mather, when he asserted that “Milk for Babes” would be 
“valued and studied and improved till New England cease 
to be New England.”* 
To the little colonials this “Catechism of New England” 
was a great improvement upon any predecessor, even upon 
the Westminster Shorter Catechism, for it reduced the one 
hundred and seven questions of that famous body of doétrine 
to sixty-seven, and the longest answer in “Milk for Babes” 
contained only eighty-four words.+ 
As the century grew older other catechisms were printed. 
The number produced before the eighteenth century bears 
witness to the diverse views in a community in which they 
were considered an essential for every member, adult or child. 
Among the six hundred titles roughly computed as the out- 
put of the press by seventeen hundred in the new country, 
eleven different catechisms may be counted, with twenty edi- 
tions in all; of these the titles of four indicate that they were 
designed for very little children. In each community the pas- 
tor appointed the catechism to be taught in the school, and 
joined the teacher in drilling the children in its questions and 
answers. Indeed, the answers were regarded as irrefutable in 
those uncritical days, and hence a strong shield and buckler

against manifold temptations provided by “yt ould deluder 
Satan.” To offset the task of learning these doétrines of the 
church, it is probable that the mothers regaled the little ones 
with old folk-lore tales when the family gathered together 
around the great living-room fire in the winter evening, or 
asked eagerly for a bedtime story in the long summer twi- 
light. Tales such as “Jack the Giant Killer,” “Tom Thumb,” 
the “Children in the Wood,” and “Guy of Warwick,” were 
orally currenteven among the plain people of England, though 
frowned upon by many of the Puritan element. Therefore it 
is at least presumable that these were all familiar to the colo- 
nists. In fact, it is known that John Dunton, in sixteen hun- 
dred and eighty-six, sold in his Boston warehouse “The His- 
tory of Tom Thumb,” which he facetiously offered to an igno- 
rant customer “in folio with Marginal notes.” Besides these 
orally related tales of enchantment, the children had a few 
simple pastimes, but at first the few toys were necessarily of 
home manufacture. On the whole, amusements were not en- 
couraged, although “In the year sixteen hundred and ninety- 
five Mr. Higginson,” writes Mrs. Earle, “wrote from Massa- 
chusetts to his brother in England, that if toys were imported 
in small quantity to America, they would sell.” And a ven- 
ture of this character was certainly made by seventeen hun- 
dred and twelve in Boston. Still, these were the exception in 
acommonwealth where amusements were considered as wiles 
of the Devil, against whom the ministers constantly warned 
the congregations committed to their charge. 
Home inthe seventeenth century —and indeed in the eight- 
eenth century —was a place where for children the rule “to 
oe]
-P-A-G-E-19

be seen, not heard,” was striétly enforced. To read Judge 
Sewall’s diary is to be convinced that for children to obtain 
any importance in life, death was necessary. Funerals of little 
ones were of frequent occurrence, and were conducted with 
great ceremony, in which pomp and meagre preparation were 
strangely mingled. Baby Henry Sewall’s funeral procession, 
for instance, included eight ministers, the governor and mag- 
istrates of the county, and two nurses who bore the little 
body to the grave, into which, half full of water from the rag- 
ing storm, the rude coffin was lowered. Death was kept before 
the eyes of every member of the colony; even two-year-old 
babies learned such mournful verse as this: 
“TI, in the Burying Place may See 
Graves Shorter than I; 
From Death’s Arreft no age is free 
Young Children too may die; 
My God, may such an awful Sight 
Awakening be to me! 
Oh! that by Grace I might 
For Death prepared be.” 
When the younger members of the family are otherwise men- 
tioned in the Judge’s diary, it is perhaps to note the parents’ 
pride in the eighteen-months-old infant’s knowledge of the 
catechism, an acquirement rewarded by the gift of a red apple, 
but which suggests the reason for many funerals. Or, again, 
difficulties with the alphabet are sorrowfully put down; and 
also delinquencies at the age of four in attending family prayer, 
with a full account of punishments meted out to the culprit. 
Such details are, indeed, but natural, for under the stern con- 
ditions imposed by Cotton and the Mathers, religion looms

large in the foreground of any sketch of family life handed 
down from the first century of the Massachusetts colony. Per- 
haps the very earliest picture in which a colonial child with 
a book occupies the centre of the canvas is that given in a 
letter of Samuel Sewall’s. In sixteen hundred and seventy-one 
he wrote with pride to a friend of “little Betty, who though 
Reading passing well, took Three Moneths to Read the first 
Volume of the Book of Martyrs” as she sat by the fire-light at 
night after her daily task of spinning was done. Foxe’s “ Mar- 
tyrs,” seems gruesome reading for a little girl at bedtime, but 
it was so popular in England that, with the Bible and Cate- 
chism, it was included in the library of all households that 
could afford it. 
Just ten years later, insixteen hundred and eighty-one, Bun- 
yan’s “ Pilgrim’s Progress” was printed in Boston by Samuel 
Green, and, being easily obtainable, superseded ina measure the 
“Book of Martyrs” as a household treasure. Bunyan’s dream, 
according to Macaulay, was the daily conversation of thou- 
sands, and was received in New England with far greater eager- 
ness than in the author’s own country. The children undoubt- 
edly listened to the talk of their elders and gazed with wide- 
open eyes at the execrable plates in the imported editions 
illustrating Christian’s journey. After the deaths by fire and 
sword of the Martyrs, the Pilgrim’s difficulties in the Slough 
of Despond, or with the Giant Despair, afforded pleasurable 
reading; while Mr. Great Heart’s courageous cheerfulness 
brought practically a new characteristic into Puritan litera- 
ture. 
To Bunyan the children in both old and New England 
ie
-P-A-G-E-21
  American Nursery 
were indebted for another book, entitled “A Book for Boys 
and Girls: or, Country Rhimes for Children. By J. B. Licenfed 
and Entered according to Order.”* Printed in London, it 
probably soon made its way to this country, where Bunyan 
was already so well known. “This little octavo volume,” writes 
Mrs. Field in “The Child and his Book,” “was considered a 
perfect child’s book, but was in fac only the literary milk of 
the unfortunate babes of the period.” In the light of modern 
views upon juvenile reading and entertainment, the Puritan 
ideal of mental pabulum for little ones is worth recording in 
an extract from the preface. The following lines set forth this 
author’s three-fold purpose: 
“To show them how each Fingle-fangle, 
On which they doting are, their souls entangle, 
As with a Web, a Trap, a Gin, or Snare. 
While by their Play-things, I would them entice, 
To mount their Thoughts from what are childifh Toys 
To Heaven for that’s prepar’d for Girls and Boys. 
Nor do I so confine myself to thefe 
As to shun graver things, I seek to pleafe, 
Thofe more compof’d with better things than Toys: 
Tho thus I would be catching Girls and Boys.” 
In the seventy-four Meditations composing this curious med- 
ley—“tho but in Homely Rhimes”—upon subjects familiar 
to any little girl or boy, none leaves the moral to the imagina- 
tion. Nevertheless, it could well have been a relaxation, after 
the daily drill in “A B abs” and catechism, to turn the leaves 
and to spell out this:

As like as is the Puppy to the Dog. 
He is of nature cold, his mouth is wide 
To prate, and at true Goodnefs to deride. 
Doubtless, too, many little Puritans quite envied the child in 
“The Boy and the Watchmaker,” a jingle wherein the former 
said, among other things: 
“This Watch my Father did on me beftow 
A Golden one it is, but ’t will not go, 
Unlefs it be at an Uncertainty; 
I think there is no watch as bad as mine. 
Sometimes ’t is sullen, ’t will not go at all, 
And yet ’t was never broke, nor had a fall.” 
The same small boys may even have enjoyed the tedious 
explanation of the mechanism of the time-piece given by the 
Watchmaker, and after skipping the “Comparison” (which 
made the boy represent a convert and the watch in his pocket 
illustrative of “Grace within his Heart”), they probably turned 
eagerly to the next Meditation Upon the Boy and his Paper of 
Plumbs. Weather-cocks, Hobby-horses, Horses, and Drums, 
all served Bunyan in his effort “to point a moral” while adorn- 
ing his tales. 
Ina later edition of these grotesque and quaint conceptions, 
some alterations were made and a primer was included. It then 
[12]
-P-A-G-E-23
  American Nursery 
appeared as “ A Book for Boys and Girls; or Temporal Things 
Spiritualized ;” and by the time the ninth edition was reached, 
in seventeen hundred and twenty-four, the book was hardly 
recognizable as “Divine Emblems; or Temporal Things 
Spiritualized.” 
At present there is no evidence that these rhymes were 
printed in the colonies until long after this ninth edition was 
issued. It is possible that the success attending a book printed 
in Boston shortly after the original “Country Rhimes” was 
written, made the colonial printers feel that their profit would 
be greater by devoting spare type and paper to the now fa- 
mous “New England Primer.” Moreover, it seems peculiarly 
in keeping with the cast of the New England mind of the 
eighteenth century that although Bunyan had attempted to 
combine play-things with religious teaching for the English 
children, for the little colonials the first combination was the 
elementary teaching and religious exercises found in the great 
“Puritan Primer.” Each child was practically, if not verbally, 
told that 
“This little Catechism learned by heart (for so it ought) 
The Primer next commanded is for Children to be taught.” 
The Primer, however, was not a product wholly of New 
England. In sixteen hundred and eighty-five there had been 
printed in Boston by Green, “The Protestant Tutor for 
Children,” a primer, a mutilated copy of which is now owned 
by the American Antiquarian Society. “This,” again to quote 
Mr. Ford, “ was probably an abridged edition of a book bearing 
the same title, printed in London, with the expressed design 
of bringing up children in an aversion to Popery.” In Protes- 
[ 13 ]  
-P-A-G-E-24
  
  Forgotten Books of the 
tant New England the author’s purpose naturally called forth 
profound approbation, and in “Green’s edition of the Tutor 
lay the germ of the great picture alphabet of our fore-fathers.” * 
The author, Benjamin Harris, had immigrated to Boston for 
personal reasons, and coming in contact with the residents, 
saw the latent possibilities in “The Protestant Tutor.” “To 
make it more salable,” writes Mr. Ford in“ The New England 
Primer,” “the school-book character was increased, while to 
give it an even better chance of success by an appeal to local 
pride it was rechristened and came forth under the now famous 
title of ‘The New England Primer.’” + 
A careful examination of the titles contained in the first 
volume of Evans’s “ American Bibliography” shows how ex- 
actly this infant’s primer represented the spirit of the times. 
This chronological list of American imprints of the first one 
hundred years of the colonial press is largely a record in type 
of the religious activity of the country, and is impressive as a 
witness to the obedience of the press to the law of supply and 
demand. With the Puritan appetite for a grim religion served 
in sermons upon every subject, ornamented and seasoned with 
supposedly apt Scriptural quotations, a demand was created 
for printed discourses to be read and inwardly digested at home. 
This demand the printers supplied. Amid such literary condi- 
tions the primer came as light food for infants’ minds, and as 
such was accepted by parents to impress religious ideas when 
teaching the alphabet. 
It is not by any means certain that the first edition of this 
great primer of our ancestors contained illustrations, as en-

gravers were few in America before the eighteenth century. 
Yet it seems altogether probable that they were introduced 
early in the next century, as by seventeen hundred and seven- 
teen Benjamin Harris, Jr., had printed in Boston “The Holy 
Bible in Verse,” containing cuts identical with those in “The 
New England Primer” of a somewhat later date, and these 
pictures could well have served as illustrations for both these 
books for children’s use, profit, and pleasure. At all events, the 
thorough approval by parents and clergy of this small school- 
book soon brought to many a household the novelty of a real 
picture-book. 
Hitherto little children had been perforce content with the 
few illustrations the adult books afforded. Now the printing 
of this tiny volume, with its curious black pictures accompany- 
ing the text of religious instruction, catechism, and alphabets, 
marked a milestone on the long lane that eventually led to 
the well-drawn pictures in the modern books for children. 
It is difficult at so late a day to estimate corre@tly the 
pleasure this famous picture alphabet brought to the various 
colonial households. What the original illustrations were like 
can only be inferred from those in “ The Holy Bible in Verse,” 
and in later editions of the primer itself. In the Bible Adam (or ~ 
is it Eve?) stands pointing to a tree around which a serpent is 
coiled. By seventeen hundred and thirty-seven the engraver 
was sufficiently skilled to represent two figures, who stand 
as colossal statues on either side of the tree whose fruit had 
had such disastrous effects. However, at a time when art crit- 
icism had no terrors for the engraver, it could well have been 
a delight to many a family of little ones to gaze upon

-P-A-G-E-26
  Forgotten Books of the 
“The Lion bold 
The Lamb doth hold” 
and to speculate upon the exact place where the lion ended 
and the lamb began. The wholly religious character of the 
book was no drawback to its popularity, for the two great 
diaries of the time show how absolutely religion permeated 
the atmosphere surrounding both old and young. 
Cotton Mather’s diary gives various glimpses of his dealing 
with his own and other people’s children. His son Increase, 
or “Cressy,” as he was affectionately called, seems to have 
been particularly unresponsive to religious coercion. Mather’s 
method, however, appears to have been more efficacious with 
the younger members of his family, and of Elizabeth and 
Samuel (seven years of age) he wrote: “My two younger 
children shall before the Psalm and prayer answer a Quees- 
tion in the catechism; and have their Leaves ready turned 
unto the proofs of the Answer in the Bible; which they shall 
distinétly read unto us, and show what they prove. This also 
shall supply a fresh matter for prayer.” Again he tells of 
his table talk: “Tho’ I will have my table talk facetious 
as well as instructive .. . yett I will have the Exercise con- 
tinually intermixed. I will set before them some sentence 
of the Bible, and make some useful Remarks upon it.” 
Other people’s children he taught as occasion offered; even 
when “on the Road in the Woods,” he wrote on another

far greater than in any other book printed in the colonies for 
years. 
Certain titles indicate the nature of the meagre juvenile 
literary fare in the beginning of the new eighteenth century. 
In seventeen hundred Nicholas Boone, in his “Shop over 
against the old Meeting-house” in Boston, reprinted Jane- 
way’s “Token for Children.” To this was added by the Bos- 
ton printer a “Token for the children of New England, or 
some examples of children in whom the fear of God was 
remarkably budding when they dyed; in several parts of New 
England.” Of course its author, the Reverend Mr. Mather, 
found colonial “examples” as deeply religious as any that 
the mother country could produce; but there is for us a 
grim humor in these various incidents concerning pious and 
precocious infants “of thin habit and pale countenance,” 
whose pallor became that of death at so early an age. If it 
was by the repetition of such tales that the Puritan divine 
strove to convert Cressy, it may well be that the son consid- 
ered it better policy, since Death claimed the little saints, to 
remain a sinner. 
By seventeen hundred and six two juvenile books appeared 
from the press of Timothy Green in Boston. The first, “A 
Lirriz Book for children wherein are set down several direc- 
tions for little children: and several remarkable stories both 
ancient and modern of little children, divers whereof are lately 
deceased,” was a reprint from an English book of the same 
title, and therefore has not in this chronicle the interest of 
the second book. The purpose of its publication is given in 
Mather’s diary:

About this Time sending my little son to School, Where 
ye Child was Learning to Read, I did use every morning for 
diverse months, to Write in a plain Hand for the Child, and 
send thither by him, a Lesson in Verse, to be not only read, 
but also Gott by Heart. My proposal was to have the Child 
improve in goodness, at the same time that he improved in 
Reading. Upon further Thoughts I apprehended that a Col- 
le&tion of some of them would be serviceable to ye Good 
Education of other children. So I lett ye printer take them 
& print them, in some hope of some Help to thereby con- 
tributed unto that great Intention of a Good Education. The 
book is entituled Good Lessons for Children ; or Instruction pro- 
vided for a little Son to learn at School, when learning to 
Read. 
Although this small book lives only by record, it is safe to 
assume from the extracts of the author's diary already quoted, 
that it lacked every quality of amusement, and was adapted 
only to those whom he described, in a sermon preached be- 
fore the Governor and Council, as “verie Sharpe and early 
Ripe in their capacities.” “Good Lessons” has the distinétion 
of being the first American book to be composed, like many 
a modern publication, for a particular young child; and, with 
its purpose “to improve in goodness,” struck clearly the key- 
note of the greater part of all writing for children during the 
succeeding one hundred and seventy-five years. 
The first glimpse of the amusement book proper appears 
in that unique “History of Printing in America,” by Isaiah

Thomas. This describes, among other old printers, one Thomas 
Fleet, who established himself in Boston about 1713. “At 
first,” wrote Mr. Thomas, “he printed pamphlets for book- 
sellers, small books for children and ballads” in Pudding 
Lane.* “He owned several negroes, one of which .. . was 
an ingenious man and cut on wooden blocks all the pictures 
which decorated the ballads and small books for his master.” + 
As corroborative of these statements Thomas also mentions 
Thomas Fleet, Sr., as “the putative compiler of Mother Goose 
Melodies, which he first published in 1719, bearing the title 
of ‘Songs for the Nursery.’” 
Much discussion has arisen as to the earliest edition of 
Mother Goose. Thomas’s suggestion as to the origin of the first 
American edition has been of late years relegated to the region 
of myth. Nevertheless, there is something to be said in favor 
of the existence of some book of nonsense at that time. The 
Boston “News Letter” for April 12-19, 1739, contained a 
criticism of Tate and Brady’s version of the Psalms, in which 
the reviewer wrote that in Psalm vi the translators used the 
‘phrase, “a wretch forlorn.” He added: “(1) There is nothing 
of this in the original or the English Psalter. (2) ’T is a low 
expression and to add alow one is the less allowable. But 
(3) what I am most concerned for is, that it will be apt to 
make our Children think of the line in their vulgar Play song; 
much like it, ‘ This is the maiden all forlorn.”’” We recognize at 
once a reference to our nursery friend of the House that Jack 
Built;” and if this and “Tom Thumb” were sold in Boston, 
why should not other ditties have been among the chap-books

which Thomas remembered to have set up when a ’prentice 
lad in the printing-house of Zechariah Fowle, who in turn 
had copied some issued previously by Thomas Fleet? In fur- 
ther confirmation of Thomas’s statement is a paragraph in the 
preface to an edition of Mother Goose, published in Boston 
in 1833, by Monroe & Francis. The editor traces the origin of 
these rhymes to a London book entitled, “Rhymes for the 
Nursery or Lullabies for Children,” “that,” he writes, “con- 
tained many of the identical pieces handed down to us.” He 
continues: “The first book of the kind known to be printed 
in this country dears [the ttalics are mine] the title, ‘Songs for 
the Nursery: or Mother Goose’s Melodies for Children?” Something 
probably intended to represent a goose, with a very long neck 
and mouth wide open, covered a large part of the title-page; 
at the bottom of which was: ‘Printed by T. Fleet, at his print- 
ing house, Pudding Lane (Boston) 1719.’ Several pages were 
missing, so that the whole number could not be ascertained.” 
The editor clearly writes as if he had either seen, or heard 
accurately described, this piece of Americana, which the bib- 
liophile to-day would consider a treasure trove. Later writers 
doubt whether any such book existed, for it is hardly credible 
that the Puritan element which so largely composed the popu- 
lation of Boston in the first quarter of the eighteenth century 
would have encouraged the printing of any nonsensical jingles. 
Boston, however, was not at this time the only place in 
the colonies where primers and religious books were written 
and printed. In Philadelphia, Andrew Bradford, famous as 
the founder of the “American Weekly Mercury,” had in 
1714 put through his press, probably upon subscription, the 
[ 20 ]

American Nursery 
“Last Words and Dyeing Expressions of Hannah Hill, aged 
11 years and near three Months.” This morbid account of 
the death of a little Quakeress furnished the Philadelphia 
children with a book very similar to Mather’s “Token.” Not 
to be outdone by any precocious example in Pennsylvania, 
the Reverend Mr. Mather soon found an instance of “Early 
Piety in Elizabeth Butcher of Boston, being just 8 years and 
11 months old,” when she died in 1718. In two years two 
editions of her life had been issued “to instruét and to invite 
little children to the exercise of early piety.” 
Such mortuary effusions were so common at the time that 
Benjamin Franklin’s witty skit upon them is apropos in this 
connection. In 1719, at the age of sixteen, under the pseu- 
donym of Mrs. Dogood, he wrote a series of letters for his 
brother’s paper, “ The New England Courant.” From the fol- 
lowing extrac, taken from these letters, it is evident that these 
children’s “Last Words” followed the prevailing fashion: 
A Recetpt to make a New England

Of other original books for children of colonial parents in the 
first quarter of that century, “ A Looking-glass” did but mirror 
more religious episodes concerning infants, while Mather in 
his zeal had also published “ An Earnest Exhortation” to New 
England children, and“ The A, B, C, ofreligion. Fitted untothe 
youngest and lowest capacities.” To this, taking advantage 
of the use of rhymes, he appended further instruction, includ- 
ing “The Body of Divinity versified.” With our knowledge

of the clergyman’s methods with his congregation it is not 
difficult to imagine that he insisted upon the purchase of these 
godly aids for every household. 
In attempting to reproduce the conditions of family life 
in the early settlements and towns of colonial days, we turn 
quite naturally to the newspapers, whose appearance in the 
first quarter of the eighteenth century was gladly welcomed 
by the people of their time, and whose files are now eagerly 
searched for items of great or small importance. Indeed, much 
information can be gathered from their advertisements, which 
often filled the major part of these periodicals. Apparently 
shop-keepers were keen to take advantage of such space as 
was reserved for them, as sometimes a marginal note informed 
the public that other advertisements must wait for the next 
issue to appear. 
Booksellers’ announcements, however, are not too frequent 
in Boston papers, and are noticeably lacking in the early is- 
sues of the Philadelphia “ Weekly Mercury.” This dearth of 
book-news accounts for the difficulty experienced by book- 
lovers of that town in procuring literature—a lack noticed 
at once by the wide-awake young Franklin upon his arrival 
in the city, and recorded in his biography as follows: 
“At the time I established myself in Pennsylvania [1728] 
there was not a bookseller’s shop in any of the colonies to the 
southward of Boston. In New York and Phil’a. the printers 
were indeed stationers ; they sold only paper, etc., ballads, and 
a few books. Those who lov’d reading were obliged to send 
for their books from London.” 
Franklin undertook to better this condition by opening 
1234]
-P-A-G-E-34

ashop for the sale of foreign books. Both he and his rival in 
journalism, Andrew Bradford, had stationer’s shops, in which 
were to be had besides “Good Writing Paper; Cyphering 
Slates; Ink Powders, etc., Chapmens Books and Ballads.” 
Bradford also advertised in seventeen hundred and thirty that 
all persons could be supplied with “Primers and small His- 
tories of many sorts.” “Small histories” were probably chap- 
books, which, hawked about the country by peddlers or chap- 
men, contained tales of “Fair Rosamond,” “Jane Grey,” 
“Tom Thumb” or “Tom Hick-a-Thrift,” and though read 
by old and young, were hardly more suitable for juvenile 
reading than the religious elegies then so popular. These 
chap-books were sold in considerable quantities on account 
of their cheapness, and included religious subjects as well as 
tales of adventure. 
One of the earliest examples of this chap-book literature, 
thought suitable for children, was printed in the colonies by 
the press of Thomas Fleet, already mentioned as a printer 
of small books. This book of 1736, being intended for ready 
sale, was such as every Puritan would buy for the family 
library. Entitled “The Prodigal Daughter,” it told in Psalm- 
book metre of a “proud, vain girl, who, because her parents 
would not indulge her in all her extravagances, bargained 
with the devil to poisen them.” The parents, however, were 
warned by an angel of her intentions: 
“One night her parents fleeping were in bed 
Nothing but troubled dreams run in their head, 
At length an angel did to them appear 
Saying awake, and unto me give ear.

The daughter, discovered in her attempt to poison their food, 
was reproached by the mother for her evil intention and 
swooned. Every effort failed to “bring her spirits to revive :” 
“Four days they kept her, when they did prepare

The Puritan pride in funeral display is naively exhibited in 
the portrayal of the girl when she “in her coffin sat, and did 
admire her winding sheet,” before she related her experiences 
“among lonesome wild deferts and briary woods, which dif- 
mal were and dark.” But immediately after her description 
of the lake of burning misery and of the fierce grim Tempter, 
the Puritan matter-of-fa& acceptance of it all is suggested by 
the concluding lines:

The illustrations of a later edition entered thoroughly into 
the spirit of the author’s intent, The contemporary opinion 
of the French charaéter is quaintly shown in the portrait of 
the Devil dressed as a French gentleman, his cloven foot dis- 
covering his identity. Whatever deficiencies are revealed in 
these early attempts to illustrate, they invariably expressed 
the artist’s purpose, and in this case the Devil, after the girl’s 
conversion, is drawn in lines very acceptable to Puritan chil- 
dren’s idea of his personality. 
Almanacs also were in demand, and furnished parents and 
children, in many cases, with their entire library for week-day 
reading. “Successive numbers hung from a string by the 
chimney or ranked by years and generations on cupboard 
shelves.” * But when Franklin made “ Poor Richard” an in- 
ternational success, he, by giving short extracts from Swift, 
Steele, Defoe, and Bacon, accustomed the provincial popu- 
lation, old and young, to something better than the meagre 
religious fare provided by the colonial press. 
Such, then, were the literary conditions for children when 
an advertisement inserted in the “Weekly Mercury” gave 
promise of better days for the little Philadelphians.+ Strangely 
enough, this attempt to make learning seem attra¢tive to 
children did not appear in the booksellers’ lists; but crowded 
in between Tandums, Holland Tapes, London Steel, and

good Muscavado Sugar, — “Guilt horn books” were adver- 
tised by Joseph Sims in 1740 as “‘for sale on reasonable Terms 
for Cash.” 
Horn-books in themselves were only too common, and not 
in the least delightful. Made of thin wood, whereon was 
placed a printed sheet of paper containing the alphabet and 
Lord’s Prayer, a horn-book was hardly, properly speaking, 
a book at all. But when the printed page was covered with 
yellowish transparent horn, secured to the wooden back by 
strips of brass, it furnished an economical and practically in- 
destructible elementary text-book for thousands of English- 
speaking children on both sides of the Atlantic. Sometimes 
an effort was also made to guard against the inconvenient 
faculty of children for losing school-books, by attaching a 
cord, which, passing through a hole in the handle of the board, 
was hung around the scholar’s neck. But since nothing is proof 
against the ingenuity of a schoolboy, many were successfully 
disposed of. Although printed by thousands, few in England 
or in America have survived the century that has elapsed 
since they were used. Occasionally, in tearing down an old 
building, one of these horn-books has been found; dropped 
in a convenient hole, it has remained secure from parents’ 
sight, until brought to light by workmen and prized as a 
curiosity by grown people of the present generation. This 
notice of little gilt horn-books was inserted in the “Weekly 
Mercury” but once. Whether the supply was quickly ex- 
hausted, or whether they did not prove a successful novelty, 
can never be known; but at least they herald the approach of

So far the only attractions to induce children to read have 
been through the pictures in the Primer of New England, and 
by the gilding of the horn-book. From further south comes 
the first note of amusement in reading, as well as the first 
expression of pleasure from the children themselves in regard 
to a book. In 1741, in Virginia, two letters were written and 
received by R. H. Lee and George Washington. These letters, 
which afford the first in any way authentic account of tales 
of real entertainment, are given by Mr. Lossing in “The 
Home of Washington,” and tell their own tale:

Georce WASHINGTON. 
In a note Mr. Lossing states that he had copies of these 
two letters, sent him by a Mr. Lee, who wrote: “The letter 
of Richard Henry Lee was written by himself, and uncor- 
tected sent by him to his boy friend George Washington. 
The poetical effusion was, I have heard, written by a Mr. 
Howard, a gentleman who used to visit at the house of 
Mr. Washington.” 
Itwould be gratifying to know the titles of these two books, 
so evidently English chap-book tales. It is probable that they 
were imported by a shop-keeper in Alexandria, as in sev- 
enteen hundred and forty-one there was only one press in 
Virginia, owned by William Sharps, who had moved from 
Annapolis in seventeen hundred and thirty-six. Luxuries 
were so much more common among the Virginia planters, 
and life was so much more roseate in hue than was the case 
in the northern colonies, that it seems most natural that two 
southern boys should have left the earliest account of any 
real story-books. Though unfortunately nameless, they at least 
form an interesting coincidence. Bought in seventeen hun-

The Play-Book in England 
  HE vast horde of story-books so constantly poured 
into modern nurseries makes it difficult to realize that 
the library of the early colonial child consisted of such books 
as have been already described. The juvenile books to-day 
are multiform. The quantities displayed upon shop-counters 
or ranged upon play-room shelves include a variety of sub- 
jects bewildering to all but those whose business necessitates 
a knowledge of this kind of literature. For the little child 
there is no lack of gayly colored pictures and short tales in 
large print; for the older boys and girls there lies a generous 
choice, ranging from Bunny stories to Jungle Books, or they 
“May see how all things are, 
Seas and cities near and far. 
And the flying fairies’ looks 
In the picture story-books.” 
The contrast is indeed extreme between that scanty fare of 
dull sermons and “The New England Primer” given to the 
little people of the early eighteenth century, and this su- 
perabundance prepared with lavish care for the nation of 
American children. 
The beginning of this complex juvenile literature is, there- 
fore, to be regarded as a comparatively modern invention 
of about seventeen hundred and forty-five. From that date 
can be traced the slow growth of a literature written with an 
avowed intention of furnishing amusement as well as instruc- 
[ 33 ]
-P-A-G-E-46
  Forgotten Books of the 
tion; and in the toy-books published one hundred and fifty 
years ago are found the prototypes of the present modes of 
bringing fun and knowledge to the American fireside. 
The question at once arises as to the reason why this lit- 
erature came into existence; why was it that children after 
seventeen hundred and fifty should have been favored in a 
way unknown to their parents? 
To even the casual reader of English literature the answer 
is plain, if this subject of toy-books be regarded as of near 
kin to the larger body of writing. It has been somewhat the 
custom to consider children’s literature as a thing wholly 
apart from that of adults, probably because the majority of 
the authors of these little tales have so generally lacked the 
qualities indispensable for any true literary work. In reality the 
connection between the two is somewhat like that of parent 
and child; the smaller body, though lacking in power, has 
closely imitated the larger mass of writing in form and kind, 
and has reflected, sometimes clearly, sometimes dimly, the 
good or bad fashions that have shared the successive periods 
of literary history, like a child who unconsciously reproduces 
a parent’s foibles or excellences. 
It is to England, then, that we must look to find the con- 
ditions out of which grew the necessity for this modern in- 
vention—the story-book. 
The love of stories has been the splendid birthright of 
every child in all ages and in all lands. “Stories,” wrote 
Thackeray,— “stories exist everywhere; there is no calcu- 
lating the distance through which the stories have come to 
us, the number of languages through which they have been 
[ 34 ]
-P-A-G-E-47
  American Nursery 
filtered, or the centuries during which they have been told. 
Many of them have been narrated almost in their present 
shape for thousands of years to the little copper-coloured 
Sanscrit children, listening to their mothers under the palm- 
trees by the banks of the yellow Jumna—their Brahmin 
mother, who softly narrated them through the ring in her 
nose. The very same tale has been heard by the Northern 
Vikings as they lay on their shields on deck; and the Arabs 
couched under the stars on the Syrian plains when their 
flocks were gathered in, and their mares were picketed by 
the tents.” This picturesque description leads exaétly to the 
point to be emphasized: that children shared in the simple 
tales of their people as long as those tales retained their fresh- 
ness and simplicity; but when, as in England in the eight- 
eenth century, the literature lost these qualities and became 
artificial, critical, and even skeptical, it lost its charm for the 
little ones and they no longer cared to listen to it. 
Fashion and taste were then alike absorbed in the works 
of Dryden, Pope, Addison, Steele, and Swift, and the novels 
from the pens of Richardson, Fielding, and Smollett had be- 
gun to claim and to hold the attention of the English read- 
ing public. The children, however, could neither comprehend 
nor enjoy the witty criticism and subtle treatment of the top- 
ics discussed by the older men, although, as will be seen in 
another chapter, the novels became, in both the original and 
in the abridged forms, the delight of many a “young master 
and miss.” Meanwhile, in the American colonies the people 
who could afford to buy books inherited their taste for litera- 
ture as well as for tea from the Puritans and fashionables in

the mother country; although it is a fact familiar to all, that 
the works of the comparatively few native authors lagged, 
in spirit and in style, far behind the writings of Englishmen 
of the time. 
The reading of one who was a boy in the older era of the 
urbane Addison and the witty Pope, and a man in the newer 
period of the novelists, is well described in Benjamin Frank- 
lin’s autobiography. “All the little money,” wrote that book- 
lover, “that came into my hands was laid out in books. Pleased 
with the Pilgrim’s Progress, my collection was of John Bun- 
yan’s works in separate volumes. I afterwards sold them to 
buy R. Burton’s Historical Collections; they were Chapmen’s 
books, and cheap, 40 or §0 in all.” 
Burton’s “ Historical Collections” contained history, trav- 
els, adventures, fiction, natural history, and biography. So 
great was the favor in which they were held in the eight- 
eenth century that the compiler, Nathaniel Crouch, almost 
lost his identity in his pseudonym, and like the late Mr. Cle- 
mens, was better known by his nom-de-plume*than by his 
family name. According to Dunton, he “melted down the 
best of the English histories into twelve-penny books, which 
are filled with wonders, rarities and curiosities.” Although 
characterized by Dr. Johnson as “very proper to allure back- 
ward readers,” the contents of many of the various books 
afforded the knowledge and entertainment eagerly grasped 
by Franklin and other future makers of the American na- 
tion. The scarcity of historical works concerning the colonies 
made Burton’s account of the “English Empire in America” 
at once a mine of interest to wide-awake boys of the day.

Number VIII, entitled “ Winter Evenings’ Entertainment,” 
was long a source of amusement with its stories and riddles, 
and its title was handed down to other books of a similar 
nature. To children, however, the best-known volume of the 
series was Burton’s illustrated versification of Bible stories 
called“ The Y outh’s Divine Pastime.” But the subje&ts chosen 
by Burton were such as belonged to a very plain-spoken age; 
and as the versifier was no euphuist in his relation of facts, 
the result was a remarkable “Pastime for Youth.” The lit- 
erature read by English children was, of course, the same; 
the little ones of both countries ate of the same tree of know- 
ledge of facts, often either silly or revolting. 
To deliver the younger and future generations from such 
unpalatable and indigestible mental food, there was soon to 
appear in London a man, John Newbery by name, who, al- 
ready a printer, publisher, and vendor of patent medicines, 
seized the opportunity to issue stories written especially for 
the amusement of little children. 
While Newbery was making his plans to provide pleasure 
for young folks in England, in the colonies the idea of a 
child’s need of recreation through books was slowly gaining 
ground. It is well to note the manner in which the little colo- 
nists were prepared to receive Newbery’s books as recreative 
features crept gradually into the very few publications of 
which there is record. 
Inseventeen hundred and forty-five native talent wasstill en- 
tirely confined to writing for little people lugubrious sermons 
or discourses delivered on Sunday and “ Catechize days,” and 
afterwards printed for larger circulation. The reprints from 
[ 37]

  Forgotten Books of the 
English publications were such exotics as, “A Poesie out of 
Mr. Dod’s Garden,” an alluring title, which did not in the 
least deceive the small colonials as to the religious nature of 
its contents. 
In New York the Dutch element, until the advent of Gar- 
rat Noel, paid so little attention to the subject of juvenile liter- 
ature that the popularity of Watts’s “Divine Songs” (issued 
by an Englishman) is well attested by the fact that at present 
it is one of the very few child’s books of any kind recorded 
as printed in that city before 1760. But in Boston, old Thomas 
Fleet, in 1741, saw the value of the element of some enter- 
tainment in connection with reading, and, when he published 
“The Parents’ Gift, containing a choice collection of God’s 
judgments and Mercies,” lives of the Evangelists, and other 
religious matter, he added a “variety of pleasant Pictures 
proper for the Entertainment of Children.” This is, perhaps, 
the first printed acknowledgment in America that pictures 
were commendable to parents Jecause entertaining to their 
offspring. Such an idea put into words upon paper and ad- 
vertised in so well-read a sheet as the “ Boston Evening Post,” 
must surely have impressed fathers and mothers really soli- 
citous for the family welfare and anxious to provide harm- 
less pleasure. This pictorial element was further encouraged 
by Franklin, when, in 1747, he reprinted, probably for the 
first time in this country, “ Dilworth’s New Guide to the Eng- 
lish Tongue.” In this school-book, after the alphabets and 
spelling lessons, a special feature was introduced, that is, il- 
lustrated “Sele& Fables.” The cuts at the top of each fable 
possess an added interest from the supposition that they were 
[ 38 ]

engraved by the printer himself; and the constant use of the 
“Guide” by colonial school-masters and mistresses made their 
pupils unconsciously quite ready for more illustrated and 
fewer homiletic volumes. 
| Indeed, before the middle of the century pictures had be- 
come an accepted feature of the few juvenile books, and “The 
History of the Holy Jesus” versified for little ones was is- 
sued by at least two old Boston printers in 1747 and 1748 
with more than a dozen cuts. Among the rare extant copies 
of this small chap-book is one that, although torn and dis- 
figured by tiny fingers and the century and a half since it 
pleased its first owner, bears the personal touch of this inscrip- 
tion: “Ebenezer... Bought June... 1749... priceo=2=d.” 
‘Was the price marked upon its page as a reminder that two 
shillings was a large price to pay for a boy’s book ? Perhaps for 
this reason it received the careful handling that has enabled 
us to examine it, when so many of its contemporaries and 
successors have vanished. 
The versified story, notwithstanding its quaintness of dic- 
tion, begins with a dignified dire&tness: 
“The glorious blessed Time had come, 
The Father had decreed, 
Jesus of Mary there was born, 
And in a Manger laid.” 
At the end are two Hymns, entitled “Delight in the Lord 
Jesus,” and “Absence from Christ intolerable.” The final 
stanza is typical of one Puritan dottrine: 
“The Devil throws his fiery Darts, 
And wicked Ones do a& their parts, 
[ 39 ]
-P-A-G-E-52
  Forgotten Books of the 
To ruin me when Christ is gone, 
And leaves me all alone.” 
The woodcuts are not the least interesting feature of this old- 
time duodecimo, from the picture showing the mother reading 
to her children to the illustration of the quaking of the earth 
on the day of the crucifixion. Crude and badly drawn as they 
now seem, they were surely sufficient to attra& the child of 
their generation. 
About the same time old Zechariah Fowle, who appren- 
ticed Isaiah Thomas, and both printed and vended chap- 
books in Back Street, Boston, advertised among his list of 
books “Lately Publith’d” this same small book, together with 
“A Token for Youth,” the “Life and Death of Elizabeth 
Butcher,” “A Prefervative from the Sins and Follies of Child- 
hood and Youth,” “The Prodigal Daughter,” “The Happy 
Child,” and “The New Gift for Children with Cuts.” Of these 
“The New Gift” was certainly a real story-book, as one of 
a later edition still extant readily proves. 
Thus the children in both countries were prepared to en- 
joy Newbery’s miniature story-books, although for somewhat 
different reasons: in England the literature had reached a 
point too artificial to be interesting to little ones; in America 
the product of the press and the chara¢ter of the majority of 
the juvenile importations, the reprints, or home-made chap- 
books, has been shown to be such as would hardly attra&t those 
who were to be the future arbiters of the colonies’ destiny. 
The reasons for the coming to light of this new form of 
infant literature have been dwelt upon in order to show the 
necessity for some change in the kind of reading-matter to be

put in the hands of the younger members of the family. The 
natural order of consideration is next to point out the phase 
it assumed upon its appearance in England, —a phase largely 
due to the influence of one man, —and once there, the modi- 
fications effected by the fashions in adult fiction. 
Although there was already much interest in the education 
and welfare of children still in the nursery, the character of 
the first play-books was probably due to the esteem in which 
the opinions of the philosopher, John Locke, were held. He it 
was who gradually moved the vane of public opinion around 
to serious consideration of recreation as a factor in the well- 
being of these nursery inmates. Although it took time for 
Locke’s ideas upon the subject to sink into the public mind, 
it is impossible to compare one of the first attempts to pro- 
duce a play-book, “The Child’s New Play-thing,” with the 
advice written to his friend, Edward Clarke, without feel- 
ing that the progress from the religious books to primers and 
readers (such as “ Dilworth’s Guide”), and then onward to 
story-books, was largely the result of the publication of his 
letters under the title of “Thoughts on Education.” 
In these letters Locke took an extraordinary course: he 
first made a quaint plea for the general welfare of Mr. Clarke’s 
little son. “I imagine,” he wrote, “the minds of children are 
as easily turned this or that way as Water itself, and though 
this be the principal Part, and our main Care should be about 
the inside, yet the Clay Cottage is not to be neglected. I shall 
therefore begin with the case, and consider first the Health 
of the body.” Under Health he discussed clothing, including 
thin shoes, “that they may leak and let in Water.” A pause

was then made to show the benefits of wet feet as against 
the apparent disadvantages of filthy stockings and muddy 
boots; for mothers even in that time were inclined to consider 
their floors and steps. Bathing next received attention. Bath- 
ing every day in cold water, Locke regarded as exceedingly 
desirable; no exceptions were to be made, even in the case 
of a “puleing and tender” child. The beneficial effects of 
air, sunlight, the establishment of good conduét, diet, sleep, 
and “physick” were all discussed by the doctor and philoso- 
pher, before the development of the mind was touched upon. 
“Education,” he wrote, “concerns itself with the forming of 
Children’s Minds, giving them that seasoning early, which 
shall influence their Lives later.” This seasoning referred to 
the training of children in matters pertaining to their general 
government and to the reverence of parents. For the Puritan 
population it was undoubtedly a shock to find Locke inter- 
esting himself in, and moreover advocating, dancing as a part 
ofachild’s education; and worst of all, that he should mention 
it before their hobby, Learnrne. In this connection it is worth 
while to make mention of a favorite primer, which, published 
about the middle of the eighteenth century, was entitled “The 
Hobby Horse.” Locke was quite aware that his method would 
be criticised, and therefore took the bull by the horns in the 
following manner. He admitted that to put the subje& of 
learning last was a cause for wonder, “especially if I'tell you 
I think it the least part. This may seem strange in the mouth 
of a bookish man, and this making usually the chief, if not 
only bustle and stir about children; this being almost that 
alone, which is thought on, when People talk about Education,

make it the greater Paradox.” An unusual piece of advice it 
most surely was to parents to whose children came the task 
of learning to read as soon as they were given spoon-food. 
Even more revolutionary to the custom of an eighteenth 
century mother was the admonition that reading “be never 
made a Task.” Locke, however, was not the man to urge a 
cure for a bad habit without prescribing a remedy, so he went 
on to say that it was always his “ Fancy that Learning be made 
a Play and Recreation to Children” —a “Fancy” at present 
much in vogue. To accomplish this desirable result, “ Dice and 
Play-things with the Letters on them” were recommended 
to teach children the alphabet; “and,” he added, “twenty 
other ways may be found . . . to make this kind of Learning 
a Sport to them.” Letter-blocks were in this way made popu- 
lar, and formed the approved and advanced method until in 
these latter days pedagogy has swept aside the letter-blocks 
and syllabariums and carried the sport to word-pictures. 
This theory had a practical result in the introduction to 
many households of “The Child’s New Play-thing.” This 
book, already mentioned, was printed in England in seven- 
teen hundred and forty-three, and dedicated to Prince George. 
Inseventeen hundred and forty-four we find through the “ Bos- 
ton Evening Post” of January 23 that the third edition was 
sold by Joseph Edwards, in Cornhill, and it was probably from 
this edition that the first American edition was printed in seven- 
teen hundred and fifty. From the following description of this 
American reprint (one of which is happily in the Lenox Col- 
le&tion), it will be seen that the “ Play-thing” was an attempt 
to follow Locke’s advice, as well as a connecting link between

The title, which the illustration shows, reads, “The Child’s

Learning to read a diversion instead of a task. Consisting of 
Scripture-histories, fables, stories, moral and religious pre- 
cepts, proverbs, songs, riddles, dialogues, &c. The whole

grow wiser than the rest of his school-fellows. 3. How a little

or for children before they go to school.” 
Coverless and faded, hard usage is written in unmistakable 
characters upon this play-thing of a whole family. Upon a fly- 
leaf are the autographs of “Ebenezer Ware and Sarah Ware, 
Their Book,” and upon another page these two names with 
the addition of the signatures of “Ichabod Ware and Cyrus 
Ware 1787.” One parent may have used it when it was fresh 
from the press of Draper & Edwards in Boston; then, through 
enforced economy, handed it down to the next generation, 
who doubtless scorned the dedication so eminently proper 
in seventeen hundred and fifty, so thoroughly out of place 
thirty-seven years later. There it stands in large black type:

“The Wolf and the Kid.” “The Good Dr. Watts,” writes 
Mrs. Field, “is supposed to have had a hand in the composi- 
tion of this toy book especially in the stories, one of which is 
quite in the style of the old hymn writer.” Here it is: 
“Once on a time two dogs went out to walk. Tray was a good 
dog, and would not hurt the least thing in the world, but Snap 
was cross, and would snarl and bite at all that came in his way. 
At last they came to a town. All the dogs came round them. 
Tray hurt none of them, but Snap would grin at one, snarl at 
the next, and bite a third, till at last they fell on him and tore 
him limb from limb, and as poor Tray was with him, he met 
with his death at the same time.

Thus we find that Locke sowed the seed, Watts watered the 
soil in which the seed fell, and that Newbery, after mixing in 
ideas from his very fertile brain, soon reaped a golden harvest 
from the crop of readers, picture-books, and little histories 
which he, with the aid of certain well-known authors, pro- 
duced. 
According to his biographer, Mr. Charles Welsh, John 
Newbery was born in a quaint parish of England in seven- 
teen hundred and thirteen. Although his father was only a 
small farmer, Newbury inherited his bookish tastes from an 
ancestor, Ralph or Rafe Newbery, who had been a great pub- 
lisher of the sixteenth century. Showing no inclination toward 
the life of a farmer, the boy, at sixteen, had already entered 
the shop of a merchant in Reading. The name of this merchant 
is not known, but inference points to Mr. Carnan, printer, 
proprietor, and editor of one of the earliest provincial news- 
papers. In seventeen hundred and thirty-seven, at the death 
of Carnan, John Newbery, then about twenty-four years of 
age, found himself one of the proprietor’s heirs and an exec- 
utor of the estate. Carnan left a widow, to whom, to quote her 
son, Newbery’s “love of books and acquirements as a printer 
rendered him very acceptable.” The amiable and well-to-do 
widow and Newbery were soon married, and their youngest 
son, Francis Newbery, eventually succeeded his father in the 
business of publishing. 
Shortly after Newbery’s marriage his ambition and enter- 
prise resulted in the establishment of his family in London, 
where, in seventeen hundred and forty-four, he opened a ware- 
house at The Bible and Crown, near Devereux Court, without

Temple Bar. Meanwhile he had associated himself with Ben- 
jamin Collins, a printer in Salisbury. Collins both planned 
and printed some of Newbery’s toy volumes, and his name 
likewise was well-known to shop-keepers in the colonies. 
Newbery soon found that his business warranted another 
move nearer to the centre of trade. He therefore combined 
two establishments into one at the now celebrated corner of 
St. Paul’s Churchyard, and at the same time decided to con- 
fine his attention exclusively to book publishing and medicine 
vending. 
Before his departure from Devereux Court, Newbery had 
published at least one book for juvenile readers. The title 
reads: “ Little Pretty Pocket-Book, intended for the instruc- 
tion and Amusement of Little Master Tommy and Pretty 
Miss Polly, with an agreeable Letter to read from Jack the 
Giant Killer, as also a Ball and Pincushion, the use of which 
will infallibly make Tommy a good Boy, and Polly a good 
Girl. To the whole is prefixed a letter on education humbly 
addressed to all Parents, Guardians, Governesses, &c., wherein 
tules are laid down for making their children strong, healthy, 
virtuous, wise and happy.” To this extraordinarily long title 
were added couplets from Dryden and Pope, probably be- 
cause extracts from these poets were usually placed upon the 
title-page of books for grown people; possibly also in order 
to give a finish to miniature volumes that would be like the 
larger publications. A wholly simple method of writing title- 
pages never came into even Newbery’s original mind; he did 
for the juvenile customer exaétly what he was accustomed to 
do for his father and mother. And yet the habit of spreading

out over the page the entire contents of the book was not 
without value: it gave the purchaser no excuse for not know- 
ing what was to be found within its covers; and in the days 
when books were a luxury and literary reviews non-existent, 
the country trade was enabled to make a better choice. 
The manner in which the “Little Pretty Pocket-Book” is 
written is so chara¢teristic of those who were the first to attempt 
to write for the younger generation in an amusing way, that it 
is worth while to examine briefly the topics treated. An Ameri- 
can reprint of a later date, now in the Lenox Collection, will 
serve to show the method chosen to combine instruction with 
amusement. The book itself is miniature in size, about two 
by four inches, with embossed gilt paper covers— Newbery’s 
own specialty as a binding. The sixty-five little illustrations at 
the top of its pages were numerous enough to afford pleasure 
to any eighteenth century child, although they were crude in 
execution and especially lacked true perspective. The first 
chapter after the “ Address to Parents” and to the other people 
mentioned on the title-page gives letters to Master Tommy 
and Miss Polly. First, Tommy is congratulated upon the good 
character that his Nurse has given him, and instruéted as to the 
use of the “ Pocket-Book,” “ which will teach you to play at all 
those innocent games that good Boys and Girls divert them- 
selves with.” The boy reader is next advised to mark his good 
and bad actions with pins upon a red and black ball. Little 
Polly is then given similar congratulations and instructions, 
except that in her case a pincushion is to be substituted for 
a ball. Then follow thirty pages devoted to “alphabetically 
digested” games, from “The great 4 Play” and “The Litile

Modern picture alphabets have not improved much upon 
this jingle: 
“Great A, Band C 
And tumble down D, 
The.-Cat’s a blind buff, 
And she cannot see.” 
Next in order are four fables with morals (written in the guise 
of letters), for in Newbery’s books and in those of a much 
later period, we feel, as Mr. Welsh writes, a “strong deter- 
mination on the part of the authors to place the moral plainly 
in sight and to point steadily to it.” Pictures also take a lead- 
ing part in this effort to inculcate good behaviour; thus Good 
Children are portrayed in cuts, which accompany the direc- 
tions for attaining perfection. Proverbs, having been hitherto 
introduced into school-books, appear again quite naturally in 
this source of diversion, which closes—at least in the Ameri- 
can edition—with sixty-three “Rules for Behaviour.” These 
tules include those suitable for various occasions, such as “ At 
the Meeting-House,” “ Home,” “The Table,” “In Company,” 
and “ When abroad with other Children.” To-day, when many 
such rules are as obsolete as the tiny pages themselves, this 
chapter affords many glimpses of the customs and etiquette 
of the old-fashioned child’s life. Such a direétion as “ Be not 
hasty to run out of Meeting-House when Worship is ended, 
as if thou weary of being there” (probably an American adap- 
tation of the English original), recalls the well-filled colonial 
meeting-house, where weary children sat for hours on high

seats, with dangling legs, or screwed their small bodies in 
vain efforts to touch the floor. Again we can see the anxious 
mothers, when, after the long sermon was brought to a close, 
they put restraining hands upon the little ones, lest they, in 
haste to be gone, should forget this admonition. The formalism 
of the time is suggested in this request, “ Make a Bow always 
when come Home, and be instantly uncovered,” for the cere- 
mony of polite manners in these bustling days has so much 
relaxed that the modern boy does all that is required if he 
remembers to be “instantly uncovered when come Home.” 
Among the numerous other requirements only one more may 
be cited—a rule which reveals the table manners of polite 
society in its requisite for genteel conduct: “Throw not any- 
thing under the Table. Pick not thy teeth at the Table, unless 
holding thy Napkin before thy mouth with thine other Hand.” 
With such an array of intellectual and moral contents, the 
little “ Pocket-Book” may appear to-day to be almost any- 
thing except an amusement book. Yet this was the phase that 
the English play-book first assumed, and it must not be for- 
gotten that English prose fiction was only then coming into 
existence, except such germs as are found in the character 
sketches in the “Spectator” and in the cleverly told incidents 
by Defoe. 
In 1744, when Newbery published this duodecimo, Dr. 
Samuel Johnson was the presiding genius of English let- 
ters; four years earlier, fiction had come prominently into the 
foreground with the publication of “Pamela” by Samuel 
Richardson; and between seventeen hundred and forty and 
seventeen hundred and fifty-two, Richardson’s “Clarissa

Harlowe,” Smollett’s “Roderick Random” and “Peregrine 
Pickle,” and Fielding’s “Tom Jones” were published. This 
fa& may seem irrelevant to the present subject; neverthe- 
less, the idea of a veritable story-book, that is a book relat- 
ing a tale, does not seem to have entered Newbery’s mind 
until after these novels had met with a deserved and popu- 
lar success. : 
The result of Newbery’s first efforts to follow Locke’s 
advice was so satisfactory that his wares were sought most 
eagerly. “ Very soon,” said his son, Francis Newbery, “ he was 
in the full employment of his talents in writing and pub- 
lishing books of amusement and instruction for Children. The 
call for them was immense, an edition of many thousands be- 
ing sometimes exhausted during the Christmas holidays. His 
friend, Dr. Samuel Johnson, who, like other grave characters, 
could now and then be jocose, had used to say of him, ‘New- 
bery is an extraordinary man, for I know not whether he has 
read or written most Books.’”* 
The bookseller was no less clever in his use of other 
people’s wits. No one knows how many of the tiny gilt 
bindings covered stories told by impecunious writers, to 
whom the proceeds in times of starvation were bread if not 
butter. Newbery, though called by Goldsmith “ the philan- 
thropic publisher of St. Paul’s Churchyard,” knew very well 
the worth to his own pocket of these authors’ skill in story- 
writing. Between the years seventeen hundred and fifty-seven 
and seventeen hundred and sixty-seven, the English pub- 
lisher was at the height of his prosperity; his name became

a household word in England, and was hardly less well known 
to the little colonials of America. 
Newbery’s literary associations, too, were both numer- 
ous and important. Before Oliver Goldsmith began to write 
for children, he is thought to have contributed articles for 
Newbery’s “Literary Magazine” about seventeen hundred 
and fifty-eight, while Johnson’s celebrated “Idler” was first 
printed in a weekly journal started by the publisher about 
the same time. For the “British Magazine” Newbery en- 
gaged Smollett as editor. In this periodical appeared Gold- 
smith’s “ History of Miss Stanton.” When later this was pub- 
lished as “The Vicar of Wakefield,” it contained a charac- 
terization of the bookseller as a good-natured man with red, 
pimpled face, “who was no sooner alighted than he was in 
haste to be gone, for he was ever on business of the utmost 
importance, and he was at that time actually compiling ma- 
terials for the history of Mr. Thomas Trip.”* With such an 
acquaintance it is probable that Newbery often turned to 
Goldsmith, Giles Jones, and Tobias Smollett for assistance 
in writing or abridging the various children’s tales; even the 
pompous Dr. Johnson is said to have had a hand in their 
prodution—since he expressed a wish to do so. Newbery 
himself, however, assumed the responsibility as well as the 
credit of so many little “ Histories,” that it is exceedingly dif 
ficult to fix upon the real authors of some of the best-known 
volumes in the publisher’s juvenile library. 
The histories of “ Goody Two-Shoes” and “Tommy Trip”

forgotten) have been attributed to various men; but accord- 
ing to Mr. Pearson in “Banbury Chap-Books,” Goldsmith 
confessed to writing both. Certainly, his sly wit and quizzi- 
cal vein of humor seem to pervade “Goody Two-Shoes” — 
often ascribed to Giles Jones—and the notes affixed to the 
rhymes of Mother Goose before she became Americanized. 
Again his skill is seen in the adaptation of “ Wonders of Na- 
ture and Art” for juvenile admirers; and for “ Fables in Verse” 
he is generally considered responsible. As all these tales were 
printed in the colonies or in the young Republic, their pe- 
culiarities and particularities may be better described when 
dealing with the issues of the American press. 
John Newbery, the most illustrious of publishers in the 
eyes of the old-fashioned child, died in 1767, at the com- 
paratively early age of fifty-four. Yet before his death he had 
proved his talent for producing at least fifty original little 
books, to be worth considerably more than the Biblical ten 
talents. 
No sketch of Newbery’s life should fail to mention an- 
other large factor in his successful experiment—the inser- 
tion in the “London Chronicle” and other newspapers of 
striking and novel advertisements of his gilt volumes, which 
were to be had for “six-pence the price of binding.” An in- 
stance of his skill appeared in the “London Chronicle” for 
December 19, 1764—January 1, 1765: 
“The Philosophers, Politicians, Necromancers, and the 
learned in every faculty are desired to observe that on the 
ist of January, being New Year’s Day (oh, that we may 
all lead new lives!) Mr. Newbery intends to publish the 
bss]
-P-A-G-E-72
Forgotten Books of the 
following important volumes, bound and gilt, and hereby 
invites all his little friends who are good to call for them at 
the Bible and Sun in St. Paul’s Churchyard, but those who 
are naughty to have none.” * 
Christopher Smart, his brother-in-law, who was an adept 
in the art of puffing, possibly wrote many of the advertise- 
ments of new books —notices so cleverly phrased that they 
could not fail to attra& the attention of many a country 
shop-keeper. In this way thousands were sold to the coun- 
try districts; and book-dealers in the American common- 
wealths, reading the English papers and alert to improve 
their trade, imported them in considerable quantities. 
After Newbery’s death, his son, Francis, and Carnan, his 
stepson, carried on the business until seventeen hundred and 
eighty-eight; from that year until eighteen hundred and two 
Edward Newbery (a nephew of the senior Newbery), who 
in seventeen hundred and sixty-seven had set up a rival 
establishment, continued to publish new editions of the 
same little works. Yet the credit of this experiment of 
printing juvenile stories belongs entirely to the older pub- 
lisher. Through them he made a strong protest against the 
reading by children of the lax chap-book literature, so excel- 
lently described by Mr. John Ashton in “Chap-Books of 
the Eighteenth Century;” and although his stories occasion- 
ally alluded to disagreeable subjects or situations, these were 
unfortunately familiar to his small patrons.

which this English publisher dressed his books expressed

an evident purpose to afford pleasure, which was increased 
by the many illustrations that adorned the pages and added 
interest to the contents. 
To the modern child, these books give no pleasure; but 
to those who love the history of children of the past, they 
are interesting for two reasons. In them is portrayed some- 
thing of the life of eighteenth century children; and by them 
the century’s difference in point of view as to the constitu- 
ents of a story-book can be gauged. Moreover, all Newbery’s 
publications are to be credited with a careful preparation 
that later stories sadly lacked. They were always written 
with a certain art; if the language was pompous, we remem- 
ber Dr. Johnson; if the style was formal, its composition 
was correct; if the tales lacked ease in telling, it was only 
the starched etiquette of the day reduced to a printed page; 
and if they preached, they at least were seldom vulgar. 
The preaching, moreover, was of different character from 
that of former times. Hitherto, the fear of the Lord had 
wholly occupied the author's attention when he composed 
a book “proper for a child as soon as he can read ;” now, 
material welfare was dwelt upon, and a good boy’s reward 
came to him when he was chosen the Lord Mayor of London. 
Good girls were not forgotten, and were assured that, like 
Goody Two-Shoes, they should attain a state of prosperity 
wherein 
“Their Fortune and their Fame would fix 
And gallop in their Coach and Six.” 
Goody Two-Shoes, with her particular method of instilling 
the alphabet, and such books as “ King Pippin” (a prodigy of

learning) may be considered as tiny commentaries upon 
the years when Johnson reigned supreme in the realm of 
learning. These and many others emphasized not the effects 
of piety,— Cotton Mather’s forte,—but the benefits of learn- 
ing; and hence the good boy was also one who at the age 
of five spelt “apple-pye” correctly and therefore eventually 
became a great man. 
At the time of Newbery’s death it was more than evident 
that his experiment had succeeded, and children’s stories 
were a printed fact.

Newbery’s Books in America 
N the middle of the eighteenth century Thursdays were 
red-letter days for the residents of the Quaker town of 
Philadelphia. On that day Thomas Bradford sent forth from 
the “Sign of the Bible” in Second Street the weekly number 
of the “ Pennsylvania Journal,” and upon the same day his 
rival journalists, Franklin and Hall, issued the “Pennsyl- 
vania Gazette.” 
On Thursday, the fifteenth of November, seventeen hun- 
dred and fifty, Old Style, the good people of the town took 
up their newspapers with doubtless a feeling of comfortable 
anticipation, as they drew their chairs to the fireside and 
began to look over the local occurrences of the past week, the 
“freshest foreign advices,” and the various bits of information 
that had filtered slowly from the northern and more southern 
provinces. 
On this particular evening the subscribers to both news- 
papers found a trifle more news in the “Journal,” but in 
each paper the same domestic items of interest, somewhat 
differently worded. The latest news from Boston was that 
of November fifth, from New York, November eighth, the 
Annapolis item was dated Oétober tenth, and the few lines 
from London had been written in August. 
The “Gazette” (a larger sheet than the “ Journal”) occa- 
sionally had upon its first page some timely article of political 
or local interest. But more frequently there appeared in its 
[ 59 ]
-P-A-G-E-78
  Forgotten Books of the 
first column an effusion of no local color, but full of senti- 
mental or moral reflections. In this day’s issue there was a long 
letter, dated New Y ork, from one whoclaimed to be “ Beauty’s 
Votary.” This expressed the writer’s disappointment that an 
interesting “ Piece” inserted in the “Gazette” a fortnight ear- 
lier had presented in its conclusion “an unexpected shocking 
Image.” The shock to the writer it appears was the greater, 
because the beginning of the article had, he thought, promised 
a strong contrast between “Furious Rage in our rough Sex, 
and Gentle mildness adorn’d with Beauty’s charms in the 
other.” The rest of the letter was an apostrophe to the fair 
sex in the sentimental and florid language of the period. 
To the women, we imagine, this letter was more accept- 
able than to the men, who found the shipping news more to 
their taste, and noted with pleasure the arrival of the ship 
Carolina and the Snow Strong, which brought cargoes valu- 
able for their various industries. 
Advertisements filled a number of columns. Among them 
was one so novel in its character that it must have caught the 
eye of all readers. The middle column on the second page 
was devoted almost entirely to an announcement that John 
Newbery had for “Sale to Schoolmasters, Shopkeepers, &c, 
who buy in quantities to sell again,” “The Museum,” “A new 
French Primer,” “The Royal Battledore,” and “The Pretty 
Book for Children.” This notice—a reduced fac-simile of 
which is given—made Newbery’s début in Philadelphia; and 
it must not be forgotten that but a short period had elapsed 
since his first book had been printed in England. 
Franklin had doubtless heard of the publisher in St. Paul’s

Churchyard through Mr. Strahan, his correspondent, who 
filled orders for him from London booksellers; but the omis- 
sion of the customary announcement of special books as “to 
be had of the Printer hereof ” points to Newbery’s enterprise 
in seeking a wider market for his wares, and Franklin’s busi- 
ness ability in securing the advertisement, as it is not repeated 
in the “Journal.” 
This “Museum” -was probably a newer book than the 
“Royal Primer,” “ Battledore,” and “Pretty Book,” and con- 
sequently was more fully described; and oddly enough, all 
of these books are of earlier editions than Mr. Welsh, New- 
bery’s biographer, was able to trace in England. 
“The Museum” still clings to the same idea which per- 
vaded “The Play-thing.” Its second title reads: “A private 
Turor for little Masters and Misszs.” The contents show 
that this purpose was carried out. It tutored them by giving 
directions for reading with eloquence and propriety; by pre- 
senting “the antient and present State of Great Britain with 
a compendious History of England ;” by instructing them in 
“the Solar System, geography, Arts and Sciences” and the in- 
evitable “Rules for Behaviour, Religion and Morality;” and 
it admonished them by giving the “Dying Words of Great 
Men when just quitting the Stage of Life.” As a museum it 
included descriptions of the Seven Wonders of the World, 
Westminster Abbey, St. Paul’s Churchyard, and the Tower of 
London, with an ethnological section in the geographical de- 
partment! All of this amusement was to be had for the price 
of “One Shilling,” neatly bound, with, thrown in as good 
measure, “Letters, Tales and Fables illustrated with Cuts.”

Such a library, complete in itself; was a fine and most wel- 
come reward for scholarship, when prizes were awarded at the 
end of the school session. 
Importations of “Parcels of entertaining books for chil- 
dren” had earlier in the year been announced through the 
columns of the “Gazette;” but these importations, though 
they show familiarity with Newbery’s quaint phraseology in 
advertising, probably also included an assortment of such 
little chap-books as “Tom Thumb,” “Cinderella” (from the 
French of Monsieur Perrault), and some few other old sto- 
ries which the children had long since appropriated as their 
own property. 
In 1751 we find New York waking up to the apprecia- 
tion of children’s books. There J. Waddell and James 
Parker were apparently the pioneers in bringing to public 
notice the fact that they had for sale little novel-books in 
addition to horn-books and primers; and moreover the 
“Weekly Post-Boy” advertised that these booksellers had 
“Pretty Books for little Masters and Misses” (clearly a 
Newbery imitation), “with Blank Flourished Christmas 
pieces for Scholars.” 
But as yet even Franklin had hardly been convinced that 
the old way of imparting knowledge was not superior to the 
then modern combination of amusement and instruction; 
therefore, although with his partner, David Hall, he without 
doubt sold such children’s books as were available, for his 
daughter Sally, aged seven, he had other views. At his re- 
quest his wife, in December, 1751, wrote the following letter 
to William Strahan:

put down the book order for the spring, and that Sally her-

As far as it is now possible to judge, the people of the 
[ 63 ]

  Forgotten Books of the 
towns soon learned the value of Newbery’s little nursery 
tales, and after seventeen hundred and fifty-five, when most 
of his books were written and published, they rapidly 
gained a place on the family book-shelves in America. 
By seventeen hundred and sixty Hugh Gaine, printer, 
publisher, patent medicine seller, and employment agent for 
New York, was importing pra¢tically all the Englishman’s 
juvenile publications then for sale. At the “Bible and Crown,” 
where Gaine printed the “Weekly Mercury,” could be 
bought, wholesale and retail, such books as, “Poems for 
Children Three Feet High,” “Tommy Trapwit,” “Trip’s 
Book of Pictures,” “The New Year’s Gift,” “The Christmas 
Box,” etc. 
Gaine himself was a prominent printer in New York in 
the latter half of the eighteenth century. Until the Revolu- 
tion his shop was a favorite one and well patronized. But 
when the hostilities began, the condition of his pocket seems 
to have regulated his sympathies, and he was by turn Whig 
and Tory according to the possession of New York by so- 
called Rebels, or King’s Servants. When the British army 
evacuated New York, Gaine, wishing to keep up his trade, 
dropped the “Crown” from his sign. Among the enthusiastic 
patriots this ruse had scant success. In Freneau’s political 
satire of the bookseller, the first verse gives a strong sugges- 
tion of the ridicule to follow: 
“And first, he was, in his own representation, 
A printer, once of good reputation. 
He dwelt in the street called Hanover-Square, 
(You’ll know where it is if you ever was there

Next door to the dwelling of Mr. Brownjohn, 
Who now to the drug-shop of Pluto is gone) 
But what do I say — who e’er came to town, 
And knew not Hugh Gaine at the Bible and Crown.” 
A contemporary of, and rival bookseller to, Gaine in seven- 
teen hundred and sixty was James Rivington. Mr. Hildeburn 
has given Rivington a rather unenviable reputation; still, as 
he occasionally printed (?) a child’s book, Mr. Hildeburn’s 
remarks are quoted: 
“Until the advent of Rivington it was generally possible 
to tell from an American Bookseller’s advertisement in the 
current newspapers whether the work offered for sale was 
printed in America or England. But the books he received 
in every fresh invoice from London were ‘just published by 
James Rivington’ and this form was speedily adopted by 
other booksellers, so that after 1761 the advertisement of 
books is no longer a guide to the issues of the colonial 
press.” 
Although Rivington did not set up a press until about 
seventeen hundred and seventy-three,—according to Mr. 
Hildeburn,—he had a book-shop much earlier. Here he 
probably reprinted the title-page and then put an elaborate 
notice in the “Weekly Mercury” for November 17, 1760, 
as follows: 
JAMES RIVINGTON

Key in Hanover Square.

From such records of parents’ care as are given in Mrs. Charles 
Pinckney’s letters to her husband’s agent in London, and 
Josiah Quincy’s reminiscences of his early training, it seems 
very evident that John Locke’s advice in “Thoughts on Edu- 
cation” was read and followed at this time in the American 
colonies. Therefore, in accordance with the bachelor philoso- 
pher’s theory as to reading-matter for little children, the book- 
seller recommended the “{Fables” to “those concerned in the 
education of children.” It is at least a happy coincidence that 
one of the earliest books (as far as is known to the writer), 
aside from school and religious books, issued as published in 
America for children, should have been the one Locke had 
so heartily recommended. This is what he had said many 
years previously: “ When by these gentle ways he begins to 
read, some easy pleasant Book, suited to his capacities, should 
be put into his Hands, wherein the Entertainment that he 
finds might draw him on, and reward his Pains in Reading, 
and yet not such as will fill his head with perfectly useless 
Trumpery, or lay the Principles of Vice and Folly. To this 
[ 66 ]

Purpose, I think Aesop’s Fables the best which being Stories 
apt to delight and entertain a child, may yet afford useful Re- 
flections to a grown Man....If his Aesop has pictures in it, 
it will entertain him much better and encourage him to read.” 
The two hundred pictures in Rivington’s edition made it, of 
course, high priced in comparison with Newbery’s books: but 
New York then contained many families well able to afford 
this outlay to secure such an acquisition to the family library. 
Hugh Gaine at this time, as a rule, received each year two 
shipments of books, among which were usually some for chil- 
dren, yet about 1762 he began to try his own hand at reprint- 
ing Newbery’s now famous little duodecimos, 
In that year we find an announcement through the “New 
York Mercury” that he had himself printed “ Divers divert- 
ing books for infants.” The following list gives some idea of 
their character:

The title of “Food for the Mind” is of special importance, 
since in it Gaine made a clever alteration by inserting the 
words “Good Boys and Girls in Ameréca.” The colonials were 
already beginning to feel a pride in the fact of belonging to 
the new country, America, and therefore Gaine shrewdly 
changed the English title to one more likely to induce people 
to purchase. 
Gaine and Rivington alone have left records of printing 
children’s story-books in the town of New York before the 
Revolution; but before they began to print, other book- 
sellers advertised their invoices of books. In 1759 Garrat 
Noel, a Dutchman, had announced that he had “the very 
prettiest gilt Books for little Masters and Misses that ever 
were invented, full of wit and wisdom, at the surprising low 
Price of only one Shilling each finely bound and adorned 
with a number of curious Cuts.” By 1762 Noel had increased 
his stock and placed a somewhat larger advertisement in 
the “ Mercury” of December 27. The late arrival of his goods 
may have been responsible for the bargains he offered at this 
holiday sale. 
GARRAT NOEL Begs Leave to Inform the Public, that 
according to his Annual Custom, he has provided a very large 
Assortment of Books for Entertainment and Improvement of 
Youth, in Reading, Writing, Cyphering, and Drawing, as 
Proper Presents at Curistmas and New-Year.

ment of Old and Young, etc. 
To-day none of these gay little volumes sold in New York 
are to be seen. The inherent faculty of children for losing 
and destroying books, coupled with the perishable nature 
of these toy volumes, has rendered the children’s treasures 
of seventeen hundred and sixty-two a great rarity. The His- 
torical Society of Pennsylvania is the fortunate possessor of 
one much prized story-book printed in that year; but though 
it is at present in the Quaker City, a printer of Boston was 
responsible for its production. 
In Isaiah Thomas’s recollections of the early Boston 
printers, he described Zechariah Fowle, with whom he 
served his apprenticeship, and Samuel Draper, Fowle’s 
partner. These men, about seventeen hundred and fifty- 
seven, took a house in Marlborough Street. Here, according 
to Thomas, “they printed and opened a shop. They kept a 
great supply of ballads, and small pamphlets for book ped- 
lars, of whom there were many at that time. Fowle was bred 
to the business, but he was an indifferent hand at the press, 
and much worse at the case.” 
This description of the printer’s ability is borne out by the 
“New-Gift for Children,” printed by this firm. It is proba- 
bly the oldest story-book bearing an American imprint now

its contents can be seen in the picture of the title-page. 
Brown with age and like all chap-books without a cover 
—for it was Newbery who introduced this more durable 
and attractive feature —all sizes in type were used to print 
its fifteen stories. The stories in themselves were not new, 
as it is called the “Fourth edition.” It is possible that they 
were taken from the Banbury chap-books, which also often 
copied Newbery’s juvenile library, as the list of his publi- 
cations compiled by Mr. Charles Welsh does not contain 
this title. : 
The loyalty of the Boston printers found expression on 
the third page by a very black cut of King George the 
Third, who appears rather puzzled and not a little unhappy; 
but it found favor with customers, for as yet the colonials 
thought their king “no man of blood.” On turning the page 
Queen Charlotte looks out with goggle-eyes, curls, and a row 
of beads about the size of pebbles around her thick neck. The 
picture seems to be a copy from some miniature of the queen, 
as an oval frame with a crown surmounting it encircles the 
portrait. The stories are so much better than some that were 
written even after the nineteenth century, that extracts from 
them are worth reading. The third tale, called “The Gener- 
osity of Confessing a Fault,” begins as follows: 
“Miss Fanny Goodwill was one of the prettiest children 
that ever was seen; her temper was as sweet as her looks, and 
her behavior so genteel and obliging that everybody admir’d 
her; for nobody can help loving good children, any more than 
they can help being angry with those that are naughty. It is

nobody regards, nobody pities. Indeed papa, said Miss Fanny, 
I would not be such a creature for all the world. You are 
very good, my little charmer, said her papa and kiss’d her 
again.” 
The inevitable temptation came when Miss Fanny went on 
“a visit to a Miss in the neighborhood; her mama ordered her 
to be home at eight o’clock; but she was engag’d at play, and 
did not mind how the time pass’d, so that she stay’d till near 
ten; and then her mama sent for her.” The child of course 
was frightened by the lateness of the hour, and the maid— 
who appears in the illustration with cocked hat and musket! 
—tried to calm her fears with the advice to “tell her mama 
that the Miss she went to see had taken her out.” “Wo Mary, 
said Miss Fanny, wiping her pretty eyes, I am above a lye;” 
and she rehearsed for the benefit of the maid her father’s 
admonition.

Story IX tells of the Good Girl and Pretty Girl. In this the 
pretty child had bright eyes and pretty plump cheeks and was 
much admired. She, however, was a meanly proud girl, and 
so naughty as not to want to grow wiser, but applied to those 
good people who happened to be less favored in looks such 
terms as “bandy-legs, crump, and all such naughty names.” 
The good sister “could read before the pretty miss could tell a 
letter; and though her shape was not so genteel her behavior 
was a great deal more so. But alas! the pretty creature fell sick 
of the small-pox, and all her beauty vanished.” Thus in the 
eighteenth century was the adage “Beauty is but skin deep” 
brought to bear upon conduct. 
On the last page is a cut of “ Louisburg demolished,” which 
had served its time already upon almanacs, but the eight cuts 
were undoubtedly made especially for children. Moreover, 
since they do not altogether illustrate the various stories, they 
are good proof that similar chap-book tales were printed by 
Fowle and Draper for little ones before the War of Inde- 
pendence. 
In the southern provinces the sea afforded better trans- 
portation facilities for household necessities and luxuries than 
the few post-lines from the north could offer. Bills of exchange 
could be drawn against London, to be paid by the profits of 
the tobacco crops, a safer method of payment than any that 
then existed between the northern and southern towns. In the 
regular orders sent by George Washington to Robert Carey 
in London, twice we find mention of the children’s needs and 
wishes. In the very first invoice of goods to be shipped to 
Washington after his marriage with Mrs. Custis in seventeen

hundred and fifty-nine, he ordered “10 Shillings worth of 
Toys, 6 little books for children beginning to read and a fash- 
ionable dressed baby to cost 10 Shillings;” and again later in 
ordering clothes, “Toys, Sugar, Images and Comfits” for his 
step-children he added: “Books according to the enclosed list 
to be charged equally to John Parke Custis and Martha Parke 
Custis.” 
But in Boston the people bought direétly from the book- 
sellers, of whom there were already many. One of these was 
John Mein, who played a part in the historic Non-Importa- 
tion Agreement. In seventeen hundred and fifty this Eng- 
lishman had opened in King Street a shop which he called the 
“London Book-Store.” Here he sold many imported books, 
and in seventeen hundred and sixty-five, when the popula- 
tion of Boston numbered some twenty thousand, he started 
the “earliest circulating library, advertised to contain ten 
thousand volumes.”* This shop was both famous and notori- 
ous: famous because of its “ Very Grand Assortment of the 
most modern Books;” notorious because of the accusations 
made against its owner when the colonials, aroused by the 
action of Parliament, passed the Non-Importation Agreement. 
Before the excitement had culminated in this “ Agreement,” 
John Mein’s lists of importations show that the children’s 
pleasure had not been forgotten, and after it their books 
singularly enough were conneéted with this historic ation. 
In 1766, in the “Boston Evening Post,” we find Mein’s 
announcement that “ Little Books with Pictures for Children” 
could be purchased at the London Book-Store; in December,

Chronicle,” among other books, “in every branch of polite 
literature,” a “Great Variety of entertaining Booxs for Cut1- 
DREN, proper for presents at Christmas or New-year’s day — 
Prices from Two Coppers to Two Shillings.” In August of 
the following year Mein gave the names of seven of New- 
bery’s famous gilt volumes, as “to be sold” at his shop. These 
“pretty little entertaining and instructive Books” were “Giles 
Gingerbread,” the “Adventures of little Tommy Trip with 
his dog Jourer,” “Tommy Trip’s Select Fables,” and “an 
excellent Pastoral Hymn,” “The Famous Tommy Thumb’s 
Little Story-Book,” “Leo, the Great Giant,” and “ Urax, or 
the Fair Wanderer — price eight pence lawful money. 4 very 
interesting tale in which the protettion of the Almighty is proved 
to be the first and chief support of the Femare Sex.” Num- 
ber seven in the list was the story of the “Cruel Giant Bar- 
barico,” and it is one of this edition that is now among the 
rare Americana of the Boston Public Library. The imprint 
upon its title-page coincides with Isaiah Thomas’s statement 
that though “ Fleming was not concerned with Mein in book- 
selling, several books were printed at their house for Mein.” 
Its date, 1768, would indicate that Mein had reproduced one 
of his importations to which allusion has already been made. 
The book in marbled covers, time-worn and faded now, was 
sold for only “ six-pence lawful” when new, possibly because 
it lacked illustrations. 
One year later, when the Non-Importation Agreement had 
passed and was rigorously enforced in the port of Boston, 
these same little books were advertised again in the “Chroni-

cle” of December 4-7 under the large caption, Printep 
In AMERICA AND TO BE SOLD BY JoHN Men. Times had so 
changed within one year’s space that even a child’s six-penny 
book was unpopular, if known to have been imported. 
Mein was among those accused of violating the “ Agree- 
ment;” he was charged with the importation of materials for 
book-making. In a November number of the “ Chronicle ” 
of seventeen hundred and sixty-nine, Mein published an 
article entitled “A State of the Importation from Great 
Britain into the Port of Boston with the advertisement of 
a set of Men, who assume to themselves Tue Tite of ALL 
the Well Disposed Merchants.” In this letter the London Book- 
Store proprietor vigorously defended himself, and protested 
that the quantity of his work necessitated some importations 
not procurable in Boston. He also made sarcastic references 
to other men whom he thought the cap fitted better with 
less excuse. It was in the following December that he tried 
to keep this trade in children’s books by his apparently patri- 
otic announcement regarding them. His protests were use- 
less. Already in disfavor with some because he was supposed 
to print books in America but used a London imprint, his 
popularity waned ; he was marked as a loyalist, and there was 
little of the spirit of tolerance for such in that hot-bed of 
patriotism. The air was so full of the growing differences 
between the colonials and the king’s government, that in 
seventeen hundred and seventy Mein closed out his stock 
and returned to England. 
On the other hand, the patriotic booksellers did not fail to 
take note of the crystallization of public opinion. Robert Bell

in Philadelphia appended a note to his catalogue of books, 
stating that “The Lovers and Prattisers of Patriotism are 
requested to note that all the Books in this Catalogue are 
either of American manufacture, or imported before the Non- 
Importation Agreement.” 
The supply of home-made paper was of course limited. 
So much was needed to circulate among the colonies pam- 
phlets dealing with the injustice of the king’s government 
toward his American subjects, that it seems remarkable that 
any juvenile books should have been printed in those stirring 
days before the war began. It is rather to be expected that, 
with the serious turn that events had taken and the consequent 
questions that had arisen, the publications of the American 
press should have received the shadow of the forthcoming 
trouble —a shadow sufficient to discourage any attempt at 
humor for adult or child. Evidence, however, points to the 
fat that humor and amusement were not totally lacking in 
the issues of the press of at least one printer in Boston, John 
Boyle. The humorous satire produced by his press in seven- 
teen hundred and seventy-five, called “The First Book of the 
American Chronicles of the Times,” purported to set forth 
the state of political affairs during the troubles “wherein all 
our calamities are seen to flow from the fact that the king 
had set up for our worship the god of the heathen— The Tea 
Chest.” This pamphlet has been one to keep the name of John 
Boyle among the prominent printers of pre-Revolutionary 
days. Additional interest accrues for this reason to a play- 
book printed by Boyle—the only one extant of this decade 
known to the writer. 
[ 76 J

This quaint little chap-book, three by four inches in size, 
was issued in seventeen hundred and seventy-one, soon after 
Boyle had set up his printing establishment and four years 
before the publication of the famous pamphlet. It represents 
fully the standard for children’s literature in the days when 
Newbery’s tiny classics were making their way to America, 
and was indeed advertised by Mein in seventeen hundred and 
sixty-eight among the list of books “Printed in America.” Its 
title, “The Famous Tommy Thumb’s Little Story-Book: 
Containing his Life and Adventures,” has rather a familiar 
sound, but its contents would not now be allowed upon any 
nursery table. Since the days of the Anglo-Saxons, Tom 
Thumb’s adventures have been told and retold; each genera- 
tion has given to the rising generation the version thought 
proper for the ears of children. In Boyle’s edition this method 
resulted in realism pushed to the extreme; but it is not to be 
denied that the yellowed pages contain the wondrous adven- 
tures and hairbreadth escapes so dear to the small boy of all 
time. The thrilling incidents were further enlivened, moreover, 
by cuts called by the printer “czréouvs” in the sense of very 
fine: and curious they are to-day because of the crudeness of 
their execution and the coarseness of their design. Neverthe- 
less, the grotesque character of the illustrations was altogether 
effective in impressing upon the reader the doughty deeds of 
his old friend, Tom Thumb. The book itself shows marks 
of its popularity, and of the hard usage to which it was sub- 
jected by its happy owner, who was not critical of the editor’s 
freedom of speech.

sufficiently clear that the standard for the ideal toy-book of 
the eighteenth century is no gauge for that of the twentieth. 
Child-life differed in many particulars, as Mr. Julian Haw- 
thorne pointed out some years ago, when he wrote that the 
children of the eighteenth century “were urged to grow up 
almost before they were short-coated.” We must bear this in 
mind in turning to another class of books popular with adult 
and child alike in both England and America before and for 
some years after the Revolution. 
This was the period when the novel in the hands of Rich- 
ardson, Fielding, and Smollett was assuming hitherto unsus- 
pected possibilities. Allusion must be made to some of the 
charatteristics of their work, since their style undoubtedly 
affected juvenile reading and the tales written for children. 
Taking for the sake of convenience the novels of the ear- 
liest of this group of men, Samuel Richardson, as a starting- 
point, we find in Pamela and Mr. Lovelace types of char- 
acter that merge from the Puritanical concrete examples 
of virtue and vice into a psychological attempt to depict the 
emotion and feeling preceding every act of heroine and vil- 
lain. Through every stage of the story the author still clings 
to the long-established precedent of giving moral and reli- 
gious instruction. Afterwards, when Fielding attempted to 
parody “Pamela,” he developed the novel of adventure in 
high and low life, and produced “Joseph Andrews.” He then 
followed this with the character-study represented by “Tom 
Jones, Foundling.” Richardson in “Pamela” had aimed to 
emphasize virtue as in the end prospering; Fielding’s char- 
acters rather embody the principle of virtue being its own 
[ 78 ]
-P-A-G-E-103
  American Nursery 
reward and of vice bringing its own punishment. Smollett in 
“Humphrey Clinker’s Adventures” brought forth fun from 
English surroundings instead of seeking for the hero thrill- 
ing and daring deeds in foreign countries. He also added to 
the list of character-studies “ Roderick Random,” a tale of the 
sea, the mystery of which has never palled since “Robinson 
Crusoe” saw light. 
There was also the novel of letters. In the age of the first 
great novelists letter-writing was among the polite arts. It 
was therefore counted a great but natural achievement when 
the epistolary method of revealing the plot was introduced. 
“Clarissa Harlowe” and “Sir Charles Grandison” were the 
results of this style of writing; they comprehended the 
“most Important Concerns of private life” —“ concerns” 
which moved with lingering and emotional persistency 
towards the inevitable catastrophe in “Clarissa,” and the 
happy issue out of the misunderstandings and misadventures 
which resulted in Miss Byron’s alliance with Sir Charles. 
Until after the next (nineteenth) century had passed its 
first decade these tales were read in full or abridged forms 
by many children among the fashionable and literary sets in 
England and America. Indeed, the art of writing for children 
was so unknown that often attempts to produce child-like 
“histories” for them resulted in little other than novels upon 
an abridged scale. 
But before even abridged novels found their way into juve- 
nile favor, it was “customary in Richardson’s time to read his 
novels aloud in the family circle. When some pathetic passage 
was reached the members of the family would retire to sepa-

rate apartments to weep; and after composing themselves, they 
would return to the fireside to have the reading proceed. It was 
reported to Richardson, that, on one of these occasions, ‘an 
amiable little boy sobbed as if his sides would burst and re- 
solved to mind his books that he might be able to read Pamela 
through without stopping” That there might be something in 
the family novel expressly for children, Richardson some- 
times stepped aside from the main narrative to tell them a 
moral tale.” * 
Mr. Cross gives an example of this which, shorn of its deco- 
ration, was the tale of two little boys and two little girls, who 
never told fibs, who were never rude and noisy, mischievous 
or quarrelsome ; who always said their prayers when going to 
bed, and therefore became fine ladies and gentlemen. 
To make the tales less difficult for amiable children to read, 
an abridgment of their contents was undertaken; and Gold- 
smith is said to have done much of the “cutting” in “ Pamela,” 
“Clarissa Harlowe,” “Sir Charles Grandison,” and others. 
These books were included in the lists of those sent to Amer- 
ica for juvenile reading. In Boston, Cox and Berry inserted 
in the “Boston Gazette and Country Journal” a notice that 
they had the “following little Books for all good Boys and 
Girls:

Up to this time the story has been rather of the books read 
by the Puritan and Quaker population of the colonies. There 
had arisen during the first half of the eighteenth century, 
however, a merchant class which owed its prosperity to its 
own ability. Such men sought for their families the material 
results of wealth which only a place like Boston could bestow. 
Many children, therefore, were sent to this town to acquire 
suitable education in books, accomplishments, and deport- 
ment. A highly interesting record of a child of well-to-do 
parents has been left by Anna Green Winslow, who came 
to Boston to stay with an aunt for the winters of 1771 and 
1772. Her diary gives delightful glimpses of children’s tea- 
parties, fashions, and schools, all put down with a childish 
disregard of importance or connection. It is in these jottings 
of daily occurrences that proof is found that so young a girl 
read, quite as a matter of course, the abridged works of Field- 
ing and Richardson. 
On January 1, 1772, she wrote in her diary, “a Happy New 
Year, I have bestowed no new year’s gifts, as yet. But have 
received one very handsome one, Viz, the History of Joseph 
Andrews abreviated. In nice Guilt and Flowers covers.” Again, 
she put down an account of a day’s work, which she called “a 
piecemeal for in the first place I sew’d on the bosom of unkle’s

shirt, and mended two pairs of gloves, mended for the wash 
two handkerch’fs, (one cambrick) sewed on half a border of 
a lawn apron of aunt’s, read part of the xxist chapter of 
Exodous, & a story in the Mother’s Gift.” Later she jotted in 
her book the loan of “3 of Cousin Charles’ books to read, 
viz.—The puzzling Cap, the female Orators & the history 
of Gaffer Two Shoes.” Little Miss Winslow, though only 
eleven years of age, was a typical child of the educated class 
in Boston, and, according to her journal, also followed the 
English custom of reading aloud “with Miss Winslow, the 
Generous Inconstant and Sir Charles Grandison.” It is to 
be regretted that her diary gives no information as to how 
she liked such tales. We must anticipate some years to find 
a comment in the Commonplace Book of a Conneticut girl. 
Lucy Sheldon lived in Litchfield, a thriving town in eighteen 
hundred, and did much reading for a child in those days. 
Upon “Sir Charles Grandison” she confided to her book 
this offhand note: “ Read in little Grandison, which shows 
that, virtue always meets its reward and vice is punished.” 
The item is very suggestive of Goldsmith’s success in pro- 
ducing an abridgment that left the moral where it could not 
be overlooked. 
To discuss in detail this class of writings is not necessary, 
but a glance at the story of “Clarissa” gives an instructive 
impression of what old-fashioned children found zestful. 
“(Clarissa Harlowe” in its abridged form was first pub- 
lished by Newbery, Senior. The book that lies before the 
writer was printed in seventeen hundred and seventy-two by 
his son, Francis Newbery. In size five by three and one-half

inches, it is decked in once gay parti-colored heavy Dutch 
paper, witha delicate gold tracery overall. This paper binding, 
called by Anna Winslow “Flowery Guilt,” can no longer be 
found in Holland, the place of its manufacture; with sarsinet 
and other fascinating materials it has vanished so completely 
that it exists only on the faded bindings of such small books 
as “Clarissa.” 
The narrative itself is compressed from the original seven 
volumes into one volume of one hundred and seventy-six 
closely printed pages, with several full-page copper-plate 
illustrations. The plot, however, gains rather than loses in 
this condensed form. The principal distressing situations 
follow so fast one upon the other that the intensity of the 
various episodes in the affeciing history is increased by the 
total absence of all the “ moving” letters found in the origi- 
nal work. The “lordly husband and father,” “the imperious 
son,” “the proud ambitious sister, Arabella,” all combined 
to force the universally beloved and unassuming Clarissa 
to marry the wealthy Mr. Somers, who was to be the means 
of “the aggrandisement of the family.” Clarissa, in this per- 
plexing situation, yielded in a desperate mood to “the ear- 
nest entreaties of the artful Lovelace to accept the protec- 
tion of the Ladies of his family.” Who these ladies were, to 
whom the designing Lovelace conduéted the agitated hero- 
ine, is set forth in unmistakable language; and thereafter 
follow the treacherous behaviour exhibited by Lovelace, the 
various attempts to escape by the unhappy beauty, and her 
final exhaustion and death. An example of the style may be 
given in this description of the death-scene:

“Clarissa had before remarked that all would be most con- 
_ veniently over in bed: The solemn, the most important mo- 
ment approached, but her soul ardently aspiring after immo- 
rality [immortality was of course the author's intention], she 
imagined the time moved slowly; and with great presence of 
mind, she gave orders in relation to her body, directing her 
nurse and the maid of the house, as soon as she was cold, to 
put her into her coffin. The Colonel [her cousin], after paying 
her another visit, wrote to her uncle, Mr. John Harlowe, that 
they might save themselves the trouble of having any further 
debates about reconciliation; for before they could resolve, 
his dear cousin would probably be no more. .. . 
“A day or two after, Mr. Belford [a friend ] was sent for, 
and immediately came; at his entrance he saw the Colonel 
kneeling by her bed-side with the ladies right hand in both 
his, which his face covered bathing it with tears, though she 
had just been endeavoring to comfort him, in noble and ele- 
vated strains. On the opposite side of the bed was seated 
Mrs. Lovick, who leaning against the bed’s-head in a most 
disconsolate manner, turned to him as soon as she saw him, 
crying, O Mr. Belford, the dear lady! a heavy sigh not per- 
mitting her to say more. Mrs. Smith [the landlady | was 
kneeling at the bed’s feet with clasped fingers and uplifted 
eyes, with tears trickling in large drops from her cheeks, as 
if imploring help from the source of all comfort. 
“The excellent lady had been silent a few minutes, and 
was thought speechless, she moving her lips without uttering 
a word; but when Mrs. Lovick, on Mr. Belford’s approach, 
pronounced his name, O Mr. Belford! cried she, in a faint

inward voice, Now! —now!—I bless God, all will soon be 
over—a few minutes will end this strife—and I shall be 
happy,” etc. Her speech was long, although broken by dashes, 
and again she resumed, “in a more faint and broken accent,” 
the blessing and directions. “She then sunk her head upon 
the pillow; and fainting away, drew from them her hands.” 
Once more she returned to consciousness, “when waving her 
hand to him [ Mr. Belford] and to her cousin, and bowing 
her head to every one present, not omitting the nurse and 
maid servant, with a faltering and inward voice, she added 
Bless — Bless — you all! —” 
The illustrations, in comparison with others of the time, 
are very well engraved, although the choice of subjects is 
somewhat singular. The last one represents Clarissa’s friend, 
“Miss Howe” (the loyal friend to whom all the absent let- 
ters were addressed ), “lamenting over the corpse of Clarissa,” 
who lies in the coffin ordered by the heroine “to be covered 
with fine black cloth, and lined with white satin.” 
As one lays aside this faded duodecimo, the conviction is 
strong that the texture of the life of an old-fashioned child 
was of coarser weave than is pleasant to contemplate. How 
else could elders and guardians have placed without scruple 
such books in the hands of children? The one explanation 
is to be found in such diaries as that of Anna Winslow, who 
quaintly put down in her book faéts and occurrences denoting 
the maturity already reached by a little miss of eleven.

HEN John Mein was forced to close his London 
Book-Store in Boston and to return to England in 
1770, the children of that vicinity had need to cherish their 
six-penny books with increased care. The shadow of impend- 
ing conflict was already deep upon the country when Mein 
departed; and the events of the decade following seventeen 
hundred and seventy-three—the year of the Boston Tea- 
Party —were too absorbing and distressing for such trifling 
publications as toy-books to be more than occasionally 
printed. Indeed, the history of the American Revolution is 
so interwoven with tales of privation of the necessities of 
life that it is astonishing that any printer was able to find ink 
or paper to produce even the nursery classic “Goody Two- 
Shoes,” printed by Robert Bell of Philadelphia in seventeen 
hundred and seventy-six. 
In New York the conditions were different. The Loyal- 
ists, as long as the town was held by the British, continued 
to receive importations of goods of all descriptions. Among 
the booksellers, Valentine Nutter from time to time adver- 
tised children’s as well as adults’ books. Hugh Gaine appar- 
ently continued to reprint Newbery’s duodecimos; and, in 
a rather newer shop, Roger and Berry’s, in Hanover Square, 
near Gaine’s, could be had “Gilt Books, together with Sta-

prayer-books and patent medicines warranted genuine.”

no discrimination between them and Newbery’s far superior 
stories; but by eighteen hundred and thirty almost all of these 
undesirable reprints had disappeared, being buried under the 
quantities of Sunday-school tales held in high favor at that

Meanwhile, the six years of struggle for liberty had ren- 
dered the necessaries of life in many cases luxuries. As early 
as seventeen hundred and seventy-five, during the siege of 
Boston, provisions and articles of dress had reached such prices 
that we find thrifty Mrs. John Adams, in Braintree, Massa- 
chusetts, foreseeing a worse condition, writing her husband, 
who was one of the Council assembled in Philadelphia, to 
send her, if possible, six thousand pins, even if they should 
cost five pounds. Prices continued to rise and currency to de- 
preciate. In seventeen hundred and seventy-nine Mrs. Adams 
reported in her letters to her husband that potatoes were ten 
dollars a bushel, and writing-paper brought the same price

Yet family life went on in spite of these increasing diffi- 
culties. The diaries and letters of such remarkable women 
as the patriotic Abigail Adams, the Quakeress, Mrs. Eliza 
Drinker, the letters of the Loyalist and exile, James Murray, 
the correspondence of Eliza Pinckney of Charleston, and the 
reminiscences of a Whig family who were obliged to leave 
New York upon the occupation of the town by British forces, 
abound in those details of domestic life that give a many 
sided picture. Joys derived from good news of dear ones, and 
family reunions; anxieties occasioned by illness, or the armies’ 
depredations ; courageous efforts on the part of mothers not 
to allow their children’s education and occupations to suffer 
unnecessarily; tragedies of death and ruined homes—all are 
tecorded with a “particularity” for which we are now grate- 
ful to the writers.

glimpses of the enthusiasm for the cause of Liberty, or King, 
which was imbibed from the parents by the smallest children. 
On the Whig side, patriotic mothers in New England filled 
their sons with zeal for the cause of freedom and with hatred 
of the tyranny of the Crown; while in the more southern col- 
onies the partisanship of the little ones was no less intense. 
“From the constant topic of the present conversation,” wrote 
the Rev. John J. Zubly (a Swiss clergyman settled in South 
Carolina and Georgia), in an address to the Earl of Dartmouth 
in seventeen hundred and seventy-five, — “from the constant 
topic of the present conversation, every child unborn will be 
impressed with the notion—it is slavery to be bound at the 
will of another ‘in all things whatsoever.’ Every mother’s milk 
will convey a detestation of this maxim. Were your lordship 
in America, you might see little ones acquainted with the word 
of command before they can distinétly speak, and shoulder- 
ing of a gun before they are well able to walk.”* 
The children of the Tories had also their part in the strug- 
gle. To some the property of parents was made over, to save it 
from confiscation in the event of the success of the American 
cause. To others came the bitterness of separation from par- 
ents, when they were sent across the sea to unknown relatives; 
while again some faint manuscript record tells of a motherless 
child brought from a comfortable home, no longer tenable, to 
whatever quarters could be found within the British lines. For- 
tunately, children usually adapt themselves easily to changed 
conditions, and in the novelty and excitement of the life 
around them, it is probable they soon forgot the luxuries of

dolls and hobby-horses, toy-books and drums, of former days. 
In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania the sentiment of 
the period was expressed in two or three editions of “The 
New England Primer.” Already in 1770 one had appeared 
containing as frontispiece a poor wood-cut of John Hancock. 
In 1775 the enthusiasm over the appointment of George 
Washington as commander-in-chief brought out another edi- 
tion of the A BC book with the same piéture labelled “Gen- 
eral Washington.” The custom of making one cut do duty 
in several representations was so well understood that this 
method of introducing George Washington to the infant 
reader naturally escaped remark. 
Another primer appeared four years later, which was adver- 
tised by Walters and Norman in the “ Pennsylvania Evening 
Post” as “adorned with a beautiful head of George Washing- 
ton and other copper-plates.” According to Mr. Hildeburn, 
this small book had the honor of containing the first portrait 
of Washington engraved in America. While such facts are of 
trifling importance, they are, nevertheless, indications of the 
state of intense feeling that existed at the time, and point the 
way by which the children’s books became nationalized. 
In New England the very games of children centred in the 
events which thrilled the country. Josiah Quincy remembered 
very well in after life, how “at the age of five or six, astride 
my grandfather’s cane and with my little whip, I performed 
prodigies of valor, and more than once came to my mother’s 
knees declaring that I had driven the British out of Boston.” 
Afterwards at Phillips Academy, in Andover, between seven- 
teen hundred and seventy-eight and seventeen hundred and 
[ 93 ]

  Forgotten Books of the 
eighty-six, Josiah and his schoolfellows “established it as 
a principle that every hoop, sled, etc., should in some way 
bear Thirteen marks as evidence of the political character of 
the owner, —if which were wanting the articles became fair 
prize and were condemned and forfeited without judge, jury, 
or decree of admiralty.” * 
Other boys, such as John Quincy Adams, had tutors at 
home as a less expensive means of education than the war- 
time price of forty dollars a week for each child that good 
boarding-schools demanded. But at their homes the children 
had plenty of opportunity to show their intense enthusiasm’ 
for the cause of liberty. Years later, Mr. Adams wrote to 
a Quaker friend: 
“For the space of twelve months my mother with her infant 
children dwelt, liable every hour of the day and of the night 
to be butchered in cold blood, or taken and carried to Boston 
as hostages. My mother lived in uninterrupted danger of being 
consumed with them all in a conflagration kindled by a torch 
in the same hands which on the Seventeenth of June [1775] 
lighted the fires of Charlestown.” + 
He was, of course, only one of many boys who saw from 
some height near their homes the signs of battle, the fires of 
the enemy’s camps, the smoke rising from some farm fired by 
the British, or burned by its owner to prevent their occupation 
of it. With hearts made to beat quickly by the news that fil- 
tered through the lines, and heads made old by the respon- 
sibility thrust upon them, — in the absence of fathers and older

brothers, —such boys as John Quincy Adams saw attive ser- 
vice in the capacity of post-riders bearing in their several 
districts the anxiously awaited tidings from Congress or 
battlefield. 
Fortunate indeed were the families whose homes were not 
disturbed by the military operations. From Boston, New York, 
and Philadelphia, families were sent hastily to the country 
until the progress of the war made it possible to return to such 
comforts as had not been destroyed by the British soldiers. The 
“Memoirs of Eliza Morton,” afterward Mrs. Josiah Quincy, 
but a child eight years of age in seventeen hundred and sev- 
enty-six, gives a realistic account of the life of such Whig 
refugees. Upon the occupation of New York by the British, 
her father, a merchant of wealth, as riches were then reckoned, 
was obliged to burn his warehouse to save it from English 
hands.Mr. Morton then gathered together in the little country 
village of Basking Ridge, seven miles from Morristown, New 
Jersey, such of his possessions as could be hastily transported 
from the city. Among the books saved in this way were the 
works of Thurston, Thomson, Lyttleton, and Goldsmith, and 
for the children’s benefit, “Dodsley’s Colletion of Poems,” 
and “Pilgrim’s Progress.” “This,” wrote Mrs. Quincy, “was 
a great favorite; Mr. Greatheart was in my opinion a hero, 
well able to help us all on our way.” During the exile from 
New York, as Eliza Morton grew up, she read all these books, 
and years afterward told her grandchildren that while she ad- 
mired the works of Thurston, Thomson, and Lyttleton, “those 
of Goldsmith were my chief delight. When my reading be- 
came afterward more extensive I instinctively disliked the 
[ 95 ]
-P-A-G-E-120
  Forgotten Books of the 
extravagant fiction which often injures the youthful mind.” 
The war, however, was not allowed to interfere with the 
children’s education in this family. In company with other 
little exiles, they were taught by a venerable old man until 
the evacuation of Philadelphia made it possible to send the 
older children to Germantown, where a Mr. Leslie had what 
was considered a fine school. The schoolroom walls were hung 
with lists of texts of Scripture beginning with the same let- 
ter, and for globes were substituted the schoolmaster’s snuff 
box and balls of yarn. If these failed to impress a child with _ 
the correct notions concerning the solar system, the children 
themselves were made to whirl around the teacher. 
In Basking Ridge the children had much excitement with 
the passing of soldiers to Washington’s headquarters in Mor- 
ristown, and with watching for “The Post” who carried 
the news between Philadelphia, Princeton, and Morristown. 
“*The Post,’ Mr. Martin,” wrote Mrs. Quincy, “was an old 
man who carried the mail, ... he was our constant medium 
of communication; and always stopped at our house to refresh 
himself and horse, tell the news, and bring packets. He used 
to wear a blue coat with yellow buttons, a scarlet waistcoat, 
leathern small-clothes, blue yarn stockings, and a red wig and 
cocked hat, which gave him a sort of military appearance. 
He usually traveled in a sulky, but sometimes in a chaise, or 
on horseback. . . . Mr. Martin also contrived to employ him- 
self in knitting coarse yarn stockings while driving or rather 
jogging along the road, or when seated on his saddle-bags on 
horseback. He certainly did not ride post, according to the 
present [1821] meaning of that term.”

Deprived like many other children of Newbery’s peace- 
ful biographies and stories, the little Mortons’ lives were too 
full of an intense daily interest to feel the lack of new litera- 
ture of this sort. Tales of the campaigns told in letters to 
friends and neighbors were reéchoed in the ballads and songs 
that formed part of the literary warfare waged by Whig or 
Loyal partisans. Children of to-day sing so zestfully the 
popular tunes of the moment, that it requires very little 
imagination to picture the schoolboy of Revolutionary days 
shouting lustily verses from “The Battle of the Kegs,” and 
other rhymed stories of military incidents. Such a ballad was 
“A Song for the Red Coats,” written after the successful 
campaign against Burgoyne, and beginning: 
“Come unto me, ye heroes, 
Whose hearts are true and bold, 
Who value more your honor, 
Than others do their gold! 
Give ear unto my story, 
And I the truth will tell, 
Concerning many a soldier, 
Who for his country fell.” 
Children, it has been said, are good haters. To the patriot 
boy and girl, the opportunity to execrate Benedi&t Arnold 
was found in these lines of a patriotic “ditty” concerning 
the fate of Major André: 
“When he was executed 
He looked both meek and mild; 
He looked upon the people, 
And pleasantly he smiled. 
It moved each eye to pity, 
Caused every heart to bleed; 
[97]

Forgotten Books of the 
And every one wished him released — 
And Arnold in his stead.” * 
Loyalist children had an almost equal supply of satirical 
verse to fling back at neighbors’ families, where in country 
distri&ts some farms were still occupied by sympathizers 
with Great Britain. A vigorous example of this style of war- 
fare is quoted by Mr. Tyler in his “Literature of the Ameri- 
can Revolution,” and which, written in seventeen hundred 
and seventy-six, is entitled “The Congress.” It begins: 
“These hardy knaves and stupid fools, 
Some apish and pragmatic mules, 
Some servile acquiescing tools, — 
These, these compose the Congress! ” + 
Or, again, such taunts over the general poverty of the land 
and charaéter of the army as were made in a ballad called 
“The Rebels” by a Loyalist officer: 
“With loud peals of laughter, your sides, 
Sirs, would crack, 
To see General Convi& and Colonel Shoe-black, 
With their hunting-shirts and rifle-guns, 
See Cobblers and quacks, rebel priests and the like, 
Pettifoggers and barbers, with sword and with pike.” 
Those Loyalists who lived through this exciting period in 
America’s history bore their full share in the heavy personal 
misfortunes of their political party. The hatred felt toward 
such colonials as were true to the king has until recently 
hardly subsided sufficiently to permit any sympathy with the 
hardships they suffered. Driven from their homes, crowded 
together in those places occupied by the English, or exiled

to England or Halifax, these faithful subjects had also to 
undergo separation of families perhaps never again united. 
Such a Loyalist was James Murray. Forced to leave his 
daughter and grandchildren in Boston with a sister, he took 
ship for Halifax to seek a living. There, amid the pressing 
anxieties occasioned by this separation, he strove to reéstab- 
lish himself, and sent from time to time such articles as he 
felt were necessary for their welfare. Thus he writes a mem- 
orandum of articles sent in seventeen hundred and eighty by 
““Mr. Bean’s Cartel to Miss Betsy Murray:— viz: Everlast- 
ing 4 yards; binding 1 piece, Nankeen 4% yards. Of Ging- 
ham 2 gown patterns; 2 pairs red shoes from A. E. C. for 
boys, Jack and Ralph, a parcel—to Mrs. Brigden, 1 pair silk 
shoes and some flowers— Arthur’s Geographical Grammar, 
—Locke on Education, — 5 children’s books,” etc. And in 
return he is informed that “Charlotte goes to dancing and 
writing school, improves apace and grows tall. Betsy and 
Charles are much better but not well. The rest of the chil- 
dren are in good health, desiring their duty to their Uncle and 
Aunt Inman, and thanks for their cake and gloves.” 
To such families the end of the war meant either the ne- 
cessity for making permanent their residence in the British 
dominion, or of bearing both outspoken and silent scorn in 
the new Republic. 
For the Americans the peace of Yorktown brought joy, 
but new beginnings had also to be made. Farms had been 
laid waste, or had suffered from lack of men to cultivate them; 
industries were almost at a standstill from want of material 
and laborers. Still the people had the splendid compensa-

their homes to take up as far as possible their various occu-

An example of the way in which business undertaken be- 
fore the war was rapidly resumed, or increased, is afforded 
by the revival of prosperity for the booksellers in Boston, 
New York, and Philadelphia. Renewals of orders to London 
agents were speedily made, for the Americans still looked 
to England for their intellectual needs. In Philadelphia—a 
town of forty thousand inhabitants in seventeen hundred and 
eighty-three—among the principal booksellers and printers 
were Thomas Bradford, Mr. Woodhouse, Mr. Oswald, Mr. 
Pritchard,—who had established a circulating library, — 
Robert Aitkin, Mr. Liddon, Mr. Dunlap, Mr. Rice, William 
and David Hall, Benjamin Bache, J.Crukshank, and Robert 
Bell. Bell had undoubtedly the largest bookstore, but seems 
not to have been altogether popular, if an allusion in “The 
Philadelphiad” is to be credited. This “New Picture of the 
City” was anonymously published in seventeen hundred and 
eighty-four, and described, among other well-known places, 
Robert Bell’s book-shop:

In 1776 Bell’s facilities for printing had enabled him to pro- 
duce an edition of “Little Goody Two-Shoes,” which seems 
likely to have been the only story-book printed during the 
troubled years of the Revolution. Besides this, Bell printed 
in 1777 “Aesop’s Fables,” as did also Robert Aitkin; and 
J. Crukshank had issued during the war an A BC book, 
written by the old schoolmaster, A. Benezet, who had drilled 
many a Philadelphian in his letters. After the Revolution 
Benjamin Bache apparently printed children’s books in con- 
siderable quantities, and orders were sent by other firms to 
England for juvenile reading-matter. 
New England also has records of the sale of these small 
books in several towns soon after peace was established. John 
Carter, “at Shakespeare’s Head,” in Providence, announced 
by a broadside issued in November, seventeen hundred and 
eighty-three, that he had a large assortment of stationers’ 
wares, and included in his list “Gilt Books for Cheldren,” 
among which were most of Newbery’s publications. In Hart- 
ford, Conneéticut, where there had been a good press since 
seventeen hundred and sixty-four, “The Children’s Maga- 
zine” was reprinted in seventeen hundred and eighty-nine. 
Its preposterous titles are noteworthy, since it is probable 
that this was the first attempt at periodical literature made 
for young people in America. One number contains:

In Charleston, South Carolina, Robert Wells imported 
the books read by the members of the various branches of 
the Ravenel, Pinckney, Prioleau, Drayton, and other fami- 
lies. Boston supplied the juvenile public largely through 
E. Battelle and Thomas Andrews, who were the agents for 
Isaiah Thomas, the American Newbery. 
An account of the work of this remarkable printer of 
Worcester, Massachusetts, has been given in Dr. Charles L. 
Nichols’s “Bibliography of Worcester.” Thomas’s publica- 
tions ranked as among the very best of the last quarter of the 
eighteenth century, and were sought by book-dealers in the 
various states. At one time he had sixteen presses, seven of 
which were in Worcester. He had also four bookstores in va- 
rious towns of Massachusetts, one in Concord, New Hamp- 
shire, one in Baltimore, and one in Albany. 
In 1761, at the age of ten, Thomas had set up as his 
“’Prentice’s Token,” a primer issued by A. Barclay in Corn- 
hill, Boston, entitled “Tom Thumb’s Play-Book, To Teach 
[ 102 ]
-P-A-G-E-127

Children their letters as soon as they can speak.” Although 
this primer was issued by Barclay, Thomas had already 
served four years in a printer’s office, for according to his 
own statement he had been sent at the age of six to learn his 
trade of Zechariah Fowle. Here, as ’prentice, he may have 
helped to set up the stories of the “Holy Jesus” and the 
“New Gift,” and upon the cutting of their rude illustrations 
perhaps took his first lessons in engraving. For we know 
that by seventeen hundred and sixty-four he did fairly good 
work upon the “ Book of Knowledge ” from the press of the 
old printer. Upon the fly-leaf of a copy of this owned by the 
. American Antiquarian Society, founded by Thomas, is the 
statement in the Worcester printer’s handwriting, “ Printed 
and cuts engraved by I. Thomas then 13 years of age for 
Z. Fowle when J. T. was his Apprentice: bad as the cuts 
are executed, there was not at that time an artist in Boston 
who could have done them much better. Some time before, 
and soon after there were better engravers in Boston.” These 
cuts, especially the frontispiece representing a boy with a 
spy-glass and globe, and with a sextant at his feet, are far 
from poor work for a lad of thirteen. “The battered diction- 
ary,” says Dr. Nichols, “and the ink-stained Bible which 
he found in Fowle’s office started him in his career, and the 
printing-press, together with an invincible determination to 
excel in his calling, carried him onward, until he stands to-day 
with Franklin and Baskerville, a type of the man who with 
few educational advantages succeeds because he loves his 
art for his art’s sake.” 
In supplying to American children a home-made library,

Thomas, although he did no really original work for children, 
such as his English prototype, Newbery, had accomplished, 
yet had a motive which was not altogether selfish and pecu- 
niary. The prejudice against anything of British manufacture 
was especially strong in the vicinity of Boston; and it was 
an altogether natural expression of this spirit that impelled 
the Worcester printer, as soon as his business was well 
established, to begin to reprint the various little histories. 
These reprints were all pirated from Newbery and his suc- 
cessors, Newbery and Carnan; but they compare most favor- 
ably with them, and so far surpassed the work of any other 
American printer of children’s books (except possibly those 
of Bache in Philadelphia) that his work demands more than 
a passing mention. 
Beginning, like most printers, with the production of a 
primer in seventeen hundred and eighty-four, by seventeen 
hundred and eighty-six Thomas was well under way in his 
work for children. In that year at least eleven little books 
bore his imprint and were sent to his Boston agents to be 
sold. In the “ Worcester Magazine” for June, 1786, Thomas 
addressed an “Advertisement to Booksellers,” as follows: 
“A large assortment of all the various sizes of CuILpREN’s 
Books, known by the name of Newbery’s Little Books for 
Children, are now republished by I. Thomas in Worcester, 
Massachusetts. They are all done excellently in his English 
Method, and it is supposed the paper, printing, cuts, and 
binding are in every way equal to those imported from Eng- 
land. As the Subscriber has been at great expense to carry 
on this particular branch of Printing extensively, he hopes 
[ 104 J

to meet with encouragement from the Booksellers in the 
United States.” 
Evidently he did meet with great encouragement from 
parents as well as booksellers; and it is suspected. that the 
best printed books bearing imprints of other booksellers were 
often printed in Worcester and bound according to the taste 
and facilities of the dealer. That this prattice of reprinting 
the title-page and rebinding was customary, a letter from 
Franklinto his nephew in Boston gives indisputable evidence :

product was already displacing the attractive imported gilt 
embossed and parti-colored covers used by Thomas, who 
seems never to have adopted this ugly dress for his juve- 
nile publications. As the demand for his wares increased, 
Thomas set up other volumes from Newbery’s stock, until 
by seventeen hundred and eighty-seven he had reproduced 
practically every item for his increasing trade. It was his cus- 
tom to include in many of these books a Catalogue of the 
various tales for sale, and in “The Picture Exhibition” we 
find a list of fifty-two stories to be sold for prices varying from 
six pence to a shilling and a half. 
These books may be divided into several classes, all imi- 
tations of the English adult literature then in vogue. The 
alphabets and primers, such as the “Little Lottery Book,” 
“Christmas Box,” and “Tom Thumb’s Play-thing,” are out- 
side the limits of the present subject, since they were written 
primarily to instruct; and while it is often difficult, to draw 
the line where amusement begins and instruction sinks to the 
background, the title-pages can usually be taken as evidence 
at least of the author’s intention. These other books, however, 
fall naturally under the heads of jest and puzzle books, nature 
stories, fables, rhymes, novels, and stories— all prototypes of 
the nursery literature of to-day. 
The jest and joke books published by Thomas numbered, 
as far as is known to the writer, only five. Their titles seem to 
offer a feast of fun unfulfilled by the contents. “Be Merry &

dren for whom they were meant were accustomed to nothing 
more facetious than the following jest: “An arch wag said, 
Taylors were like Woodcocks for they got their substance by 
their long bills.” Perhaps they understood also the point in 
this: “A certain lord had a termagant wife, and at the same 
time a chaplain that was a tolerable poet, whom his lordship 
desired to write a copy of verses upon a shrew. I can’t imagine, 
said the chaplain, why your lordship should want a copy, who 
has so good an original.” Other witticisms are not quotable. 
Conundrums played their part in the eighteenth century 
juvenile life, much as they do to-day. These were to be found 
in “A Bag of Nuts ready Cracked,” and “ The Big and Little 
Puzzling Caps.” “Food for the Mind” was the solemn title 
of another riddle-book, whose conundrums are very serious 
matters. Riddle XIV of the “ Puzzling Cap” is typical of its 
rather dreary contents: 
“There was a man bespoke a thing, 
Which when the maker home did bring, 
This same maker did refuse it ; 
He who bespoke it did not use it 
And he who had it did not know

posed to have been asked by Newbery to try his hand upon 
a juvenile natural history. 
Possibly it was as a result of Newbery’s request that we 
have the anonymous “Jacky Dandy’s Delight” and “ Tommy 
Trip’s History of Beasts and Birds.” The former appears 
to be a good example of Goldsmith’s facility for amusing 
himself when doing hack-work for Newbery. How like 
Goldsmith’s manner is this description of a monkey: 
“The monkey mischievous 
Like a naughty boy looks; 
Who plagues all his friends, 
And regards not his books. 
“He is an active, pert, busy animal, who mimicks human 
actions so well that some think him rational. The Indians say, 
he can speak if he pleases, but will not lest he should be set to 
work. Herein he resembles those naughty little boys who will 
not learn A, lest they should be obliged to learn B, too. He is 
a native of warm countries, and a useless beast in this part 
of the world; so I shall leave him to speak of another that 
is more bulky, and comes from cold countries: I mean the 
Bear.” 
To poke fun in an offhand manner at little boys and girls 
seemed to have been the only conception of humor to be 
found in the children’s books of the period, if we except the 
“Jests” and the attempts made in a ponderous manner on

the title-pages. The title of “The Picture Exhibition; contain- 
ing the Original Drawings of Eighteen Disciples. .. . Pub- 
lished under the Inspection of Mr. Peter Paul Rubens, .. .” 
is evidently one of Newbery’s efforts to be facetious. To the 
author, the pretence that the pictures were by “Disciples of 
Peter Paul Rubens” evidently conveyed the same idea of wit 
that “Punch” has at times represented to others of a later 
century. 
Fables have always been a mine of interest to young folks, 
and were interspersed liberally with all moral tales, but “En- 
tertaining Fables” bears upon its title-page a suggestion that 
the children’s old friend, “Aesop,” appeared in a new dress. 
Another series of books contained the much abridged 
novels written for the older people. “ Peregrine Pickle” and 
“Roderick Random” were both reprinted by Isaiah Thomas 
as early as seventeen hundred and eighty-eight. These tales 
of adventure seem to have had their small reflections in such 
stories as “The Adventures of a Pincushion,” and “The 
Adventures of a Peg-top,” by Dorothy Kilner, an English- 
woman. Mention has already been made of “Pamela” and 
“Clarissa” in condensed form. These were books of over 
two hundred pages; but most of the toy-books were limited 
to less than one hundred. A remarkable instance of the pith 
of a long plot put into small compass was “The History of 
Tom Jones.” A dog-eared copy of such an edition of “Tom 
Jones” is still in existence. Its flowery Dutch binding covers 
only thirty-one pages, four inches long, with a frontispiece 
and five wood-cut illustrations. In so small a space no detailed 
account of the life of the hero is to be expected; nevertheless,

the first paragraph introduces.Tom as no ordinary foundling. 
Mr. Allworthy finds the infant in his bed one evening and 
rings up his housekeeper Mrs. Deborah Wilkins. “She being 
astri&t observer of decency was exceedingly alarmed, on enter- 
ing her master’s room, to find him undressed, but more so on 
his presenting her with the child, which he ordered imme- 
diately to be taken care of.” The story proceeds— with little 
punctuation to enable the reader to take breath—to tell how 
the infant is named, and how Mr. Allworthy’s nephew, Mas- 
ter Bilfil, is also brought under that generous and respectable 
gentleman’s protection. Tommy turned out “good,” as Mr. 
Allworthy had hoped when he assumed charge of him; and 
therefore eventually inherited riches and gained the hand of 
Miss Sophia Western, with whom he rode about the country 
in their “Coach and Six.” 
Of the stories in this juvenile library, the names, at least, 
of “Giles Gingerbread,” “Little King Pippin,” and “Goody 
Two-Shoes” have been handed down through various gen- 
erations. One hundred years ago every child knew that “ Little 
King Pippin” attained his glorious end by attention to his 
books in the beginning of his career; that “Giles Gingerbread” 
first learned his alphabet from gingerbread letters, and later 
obtained the patronage ofa fine gentleman by spelling “apple- 
pye” correctly. Thus did his digestion prove of material assist- 
ance in mental gymnastics. 
But the nursery favorite was undoubtedly “Margery, or 
Little Goody Two-Shoes.” She was introduced to the reader in 
her “state of rags and care,” from which she gradually emerged 
in the chapters entitled, “How and about Little Margery and

her Brother;” “How Little Margery obtained the name of 
Goody Two-Shoes;” “How she became a Tutoress” to the 
farmers’ families in which she taught spelling by a game; and 
how they all sang the “Cuz’s Chorus” in the intervals between 
the spelling lesson and the composition of sentences like this: 
“I pray God to bless the whole country, and all our friends 
and all our enemies.” Like the usual heroine of eighteenth 
century fiction, she married a title, and as Lady Jones was the 
Lady Bountiful of the distri. From these tales it is clear that 
piety as the chief end of the story-book child has been suc- 
ceeded by learning as the desideratum; yet morality is still 
pushed into evidence, and the American mother undoubtedly 
translated the ethical sign-boards along the progress of the 
tale into Biblical admonitions. 
All the books were didactic in the extreme. A series of four, 
called “The Mother's,” “ Father’s,” “Sister’s,” and “Brother’s 
Gifts,” is a good example of this didactic method of story- 
telling. “The Father’s Gift” has lessons in spelling preceded 
by these lines: 
“Let me not join with those in Play, 
Who fibs and stories tell, 
I with my Book will spend the Day, 
And not with such Boys dwell. 
For one rude Boy will spoil a score 
As I have oft been told; 
And one bad sheep, in Time, is sure 
To injure all the Fold.” 
“The Mother’s Gift” was confined largely to the same in- 
structive field, but had one or two stories which conformed 
to the sentiment of the author of “The Adventures of a Pin- 
[212]
-P-A-G-E-140
  Forgotten Books of the 
cushion,” who stated her motive to be “That of providing 
the young reader with a few pages which should be innocent 
of corrupting if they did not amuse.” 
“The Brother's” and “Sister’s Gifts,” however, adopt 
a different plan of instruction. In “The Brother’s Gift” we 
find a brother solicitous concerning his sister’s education: 
“Miss Kitty Bland was apt, forward and headstrong; and 
had it not been for the care of her brother, Billy, would have 
probably witnessed all the disadvantages of a modern edu- 
cation”! Upon Kitty’s return from boarding-school, “she 
could neither read, nor sew, nor write grammatically, dancing 
stiff and awkward, her musick inelegant, and everything she 
did bordered strongly on affectation.” Here was a large field 
for reformation for Billy to effect. He had no doubts as to 
what method to pursue. She was desired to make him twelve 
shirts, and when the first one was presented to him, “he was 
astonished to find her lacking in so useful a female accom- 
plishment.” Exemplary conversation produced such results 
that the rest of the garments were satisfactory to the critical 
Billy, who, “as a mark of approbation made her a present 
of a fine pair of stays.” 
“The Sister’s Gift” presents an opposite picture. In this 
case it is Master Courtley who, a “youth of Folly and Idle- 
ness,” received large doses of advice from his sister. This 
counsel was so efficient with Billy’s sensitive nature that 
before the story ends, “he wept bitterly, and declared to his 
sister that she had painted the enormity of his vices in such 
striking colors, that they shocked him in the greatest degree; 
and promised ever after to be as remarkable for generosity, 
Paz]
-P-A-G-E-141

compassion and every other virtue as he had hitherto been 
for cruelty, forwardness and ill-nature.” Virtue in this instance 
was its own reward, as Billy received no gift in recognition 
of his changed habits. 
To the modern lover of children such tales seem strangely 
ill-suited to the childish mind, losing, as they do, all tender- 
ness in the effort of the authors (so often confided to parents 
in the preface) “to express their sentiments with propriety.” 
Such criticism of the style and matter of these early attempts 
to write for little people was probably not made by either 
infant or adult readers of that old-time public. The children 
read what was placed before them as intellectual food, plain 
and sweetened, as unconcernedly as they ate the food upon 
their plates at meal-time. That their own language was the 
formal one of the period is shown by such letters as the 
following one from Mary Wilder, who had just read “ The

Nursery rhymes and jingles of these present days have all de- 
scended from song-books of the eighteenth century, entitled 
“Little Robin Red Breast,” “A Poetical Description of Song 
Birds,” “Tommy Thumb’s Song-Book,” and the famous 
“Melodies of Mother Goose,” whose name is happily not yet 
relegated to the days of long ago. Two extracts from the 
“Poetical Description of Song Birds” will be sufficient to 
show how foreign to the birds familiar to American children 
were the descriptions: 
Tue BuLiFincH 
This lovely bird is charming to the sight: 
The back is glossy blue, the belly white, 
A jetty black shines on his neck and head; 
His breast is flaming with a beauteous red. 
THe TwIitE 
Green like the Linnet it appears to sight, 
And like the Linnet sings from morn till night. 
A reddish spot upon his rump is seen,

When other singing birds are dull or nice, 
To sing again the merry Twites entice. 
Reflections of the prevailing taste of grown people for bio- 
graphy are suggested in three little books, of two of which the 
author was Mrs. Pilkington, who had already written several 
successful stories for young ladies. Her “ Biography for Girls” 
[14 J
-P-A-G-E-143
  
American Nursery 
contains various novelettes, in each of which the heroine lives 
the conventional life and dies the conventional death of the 
period, and receives a laudatory epitaph. They are remark- 
able only as being devoid of any interest. Her “ Biography for 
Boys” does not appear to have attained the same popularity 
as that for girls. A third book, “The Juvenile Biographers,” 
containing the “Lives of Little Masters and Misses,” is repre- 
sentative of the changes made in many books by the printer 
to cater to that pride in the young Republic so manifest in all 
local literary productions. In one biography we note a Repre- 
sentative to the Massachusetts Assembly: 
“As Master Sammy had always been a very sober and 
careful child, and very attentive to his Books, it is no wonder 
that he proved, in the End, to be an excellent Scholar. 
“Accordingly, when he had reached the age of fourteen, 
Mr. William Goodall, a wealthy merchant in the city of Bos- 
ton, took him into his counting house, in order to bring him 
up in the merchantile Way, and thereby make his Fortune. 
“This was a sad Stroke to his poor Sister Nancy, who hav- 
ing lost both her Papa and Mama, was now likely to lose her 
Brother likewise; but Sammy did all he could to appease her, 
and assured her, that he would spend all his leisure Time 
with her. This he most punctually performed, and never were 
Brother and Sister as happy in each other’s company as they 
were. 
“Mr. William Goodall was highly satisfied with Sammy’s 
Behaviour, and dying much about the Time that Miss Nancy 
was married to the Gentleman, he left all his business to 
Sammy, together with a large Capital to carry it on. So much

is Mr. Careful esteemed (for we must now no longer call him 
Master Sammy) that he was chosen in the late General Elec- 
tion, Representative in the General Court, for one of the first 
Towns in New England, without the least expense to himself. 
We here see what are the Effects of Good Behaviour.” 
This adaptation of the English tale to the surroundings of 
the American child is often found in Thomas’s reprints, and 
naturally, owing to his enthusiasm over the recent change in 
the form of government, is made wholly by political references. 
Therefore while the lark and the linnet still sang in songs and 
the cowslips were scattered throughout the nature descriptions, 
Master Friendly no longer rode in the Lord Mayor’s coach, 
but was seated as a Congressman in a sedan chair, “and he 
looked —he looked — I do not know what he looked like, but 
everybody was in love with him.” The engraver as well as 
the biographer of the recently made Representative was evi- 
dently at a loss as to his appearance, as the four dots indi- 
cating the young gentleman’s features give but a blank look 
perhaps intended to denote amazement at his election. 
The illustrations of Thomas’s toy reprints should not be 
overlooked. The Worcester printer seems to have rewritten 
the “Introduction” to “Goody Two-Shoes,” and at the end 
he affixed a “Letter from the Printer which he desires may 
be inserted. 
Srr: I have come with your copy, and so you may return it 
to the Vatican, if you please; and pray tell Mr. Angelo to 
brush up his cuts; that in the next edition they may give us

This apology for the character of the illustrations serves as an 
introduction to a most interesting subject of conjecture as to 
the making of the cuts, and particularly as to the engraving 
of the frontispiece in “Goody Two-Shoes.” 
It will be remembered that Isaiah Thomas in his adver- 
tisement to booksellers had expressly mentioned the great 
expense he had incurred in bringing out the juvenile books 
in “the English method.” But Mr. Edwin Pearson, in his 
delightful discussion of “Banbury Chap-Books,” has also 
stated that the wood-cut frontispiece in the first American 
edition of “Goody Two-Shoes,” printed by Thomas, was 
engraved by Bewick, the famous English illustrator. A com- 
parison of the reproduction of the Bewick engraving in 
Mr. Pearson’s book with the frontispiece in Thomas’s edi- 
tion shows so much difference that it is a matter of regret 
that Mr. Pearson withheld his authority for attributing to 
Bewick the representation of Margery Two-Shoes. Besides 
the inference from Thomas’s letter that the poor cuts would 
be improved before another edition should be printed, there 
are several points to be observed in comparing the cuts. In 
the first place, the execution in the Thomas cut suggests 
a different hand in the use of the tools; again, the reversed 
position of the figure of “Goody” indicates a copy of the 
English original. Also the expression of Thomas’s heroine, 
although slightly mincing, is less distressed than the British 
dame’s, to say nothing of the variation in the fashion of the 
gowns. And such details as the replacing of the English 
landscape by the spire of a meeting-house in the distance 
seem to confirm the impression that the drawing was made 
[217] 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
  Forgotten Books 
after, but not by Bewick. In the cuts scattered throughout 
the text the same difference in execution and portrayal of the 
little schoolmistress is noticeable. Margery, upon her rounds 
to teach the farmers’ children to spell such words as “plumb- 
pudding” “(and who can suppose a better?),” presents her 
full face in the Newbery edition, and but a three-quarter view 
to her American admirers. 
These facts, together with the knowledge that Isaiah 
Thomas was a fair engraver himself, make it possible that 
his apology for the first impression of the tiny classic was 
for his own engraving, which he thought to better. 
Thomas not only copied and pirated Newbery’s juvenile 
histories, but he adopted his method of advertising by inser- 
tions in the text of these tales. For example, in “The Travels 
of Robinson Crusoe, Written by Himself,” the little reader 
was told, “If you learn this Book well and are good, you 
can buy a larger and more complete History of Mr. Crusoe 
at your friend the Bookseller’s in Worcester near the Court 
House.” In “The Mother’s Gift,” there is described well- 
brought-up Miss Nugent displaying to ill-bred Miss Jones, 
“a pretty large collection of books neatly bound and nicely 
kept,” all to be had of Mr. Thomas; and again Mr. Careful, 
in “Virtue and Vice,” “presented at Christmas time to the 
sons and daughters of his friends, little Gilt Books to read, 
such as are sold at Mr. Thomas’ near the Court House in 
Worcester.” 
Thomas and his son continued to send out these toy- 
books until their gay bindings faded away before the nov- 
elty of the printed paper covers of the nineteenth century.

The Child and his Book at the End of the Century 
NY attempt to trace the slow development of the 
American child’s story of the nineteenth century 
must inevitably be made through the school-books written 
during the previous one. Before this, English books had 
been adapted to the American trade. But now the continued 
interest in education produced text-books pervaded with 
the American spirit. They cannot, therefore, be ignored as 
sporadically in the springtime of the young Republic, they, 
like crocuses, thrust forward in the different states their blue 
and yellow covers. 
Next to clergymen, schoolmasters received the veneration 
of the people, for learning and godliness went hand in hand. 
It was the schoolmaster who reinforced the efforts of the par- 
ents to make good Americans of the young folks, by compil- 
ing text-books which outsold the English ones hitherto used. 
In the new editions of the old “New England Primer,” laud- 
atory verse about General Washington replaced the alphabet 
rhyme: 
“Whales in the Sea 
God’s Voice obey.” 
Proud parents thereafter heard their infants lisp: 
“By Washington 
Great deeds were done.”

It was printed in Hartford in seventeen hundred and ninety, 
and contained a list of subjects suitable for farmers’ children:

America, and adorned with Cuts. 
II. Rudiments of English Grammar. 
III. The Federal Catechism, being a short and easy explana- 
tion of the Constitution of the United States. 
IV. General principles of Government and Commerce. 
V. Farmers’ Catechism containing plain rules of husbandry. 
Bennington, Vermont, contributed in “The Little Scholar’s 
Pretty Pocket Companionin Rhyme and Verse,” this indire& 
allusion to political affairs: 
“TT was a toy of royalty, of late almost forgot, 
*T is said she represented France 
On English Monarchies arms, 
But lately broke his chains by chance 
And widely spread alarms.” 
But the most naive attempt to inculcate patriotism together 
with a lesson in obedience is found in “The Child’s Instruc- 
tor,” published about seventeen hundred and ninety-one, and 
written by a Philadelphian. Philadelphia had become the 
residence of the President—a fact that may account for one 
of the stories in this book about an infant prodigy called 
Billy. “The child at five years of age was always good and 
obedient, and prone to make such a remark as, ‘If you would 
be wise you must always attend to your vowels and conso- 
nants.’ When General Washington came to town Billy’s

mama asked him to say a speech to the ladies, and he began, 
‘Americans! place constantly before your eyes, the deplorable 
scenes of your servitude, and the enchanting picture of your 
deliverance. Begin with the infant in his cradle; let the first 
word he lisps be Washington, 'The ladies were all delighted 
to hear Billy speak so well. One said he should be a lawyer, 
and another said he should be President of the United States. 
But Billy said he could not be either unless his mama gave 
him leave.” * 
Another Philadelphian attempted to embody political sen- 
timent in “A Tale—The Political Balance; or, The Fate 
of Britain and America Compared.” This juvenile has long 
since disappeared, but it was advertised by its printer, Francis 
Bailey, in seventeen hundred and ninety-two, together with 
“The History of the Little Boy found under a Haycock,” and 
several other books for children. One year later a “History 
of the American Revolution” for children was also printed in 
Philadelphia for the generation who had been born since the 
war had ended. This was written in the Biblical phraseology 
introduced and made popular by Franklin in his famous 
“Parable against Persecution.” 
This enthusiasm over the results of the late war and scorn 
for the defeated English sometimes indeed cropped out in the 
Newbery reprints. An edition (1796) of “Goody Two-Shoes” 
contains this footnote in reference to the tyranny of the Eng- 
lish landlord over Goody’s father: 
“Such ts the state of things in Britain. AMERICANS prize 
your liberty, guard your rights and be happy. +

  Forgotten Books of the 
In this last decade of the century that had made a nation 
of the colonial commonwealths, the prosperity of the coun- 
try enabled more printers to pirate the generally approved 
Newbery library. Samuel Hall in Boston, with a shop near 
the court-house, printed them all, using at times the dainty 
covers of flowery Dutch or gilt paper, and again another 
style of binding occasionally used in England. “The Death 
and Burial of Cock Robin,” for instance, has a quaint red 
and gilt cover, which according to Mr. Charles Welsh was 
made by stamping paper with dies originally used for print- 
ing old German playing-cards. He says: “To find such a 
cover can only be accounted for by the innocence of the 
purchasers as to the appearance of his Satanic Majesty’s 
picture cards and hence [they] did not recognize them.” 
In one corner of the book cover is impressed the single 
word “Minch,” which stamps this paper as “made in Ger- 
many.” Hall himself was probably as ignorant of the origi- 
nal purpose of the picture as the unsuspecting purchaser, 
who would cheerfully have burned it rather than see such an 
instrument of the Devil in the hands of its owner, little Sally 
Barnes. ; 
Of Samuel Hall’s reprints from the popular English pub- 
lications, “ Little Truths” was in all probability one of the 
most salable. So few books contained any information about 
America that one of these two volumes may be regarded as 
of particular interest to the young generation of his time. 
The author of “Little Truths,” William Darton, a Quaker 
publisher in London, does not divulge from what source he 
gleaned his knowledge. His information concerning Ameri-

cans is of that misty description that confuses Indians (“na- 
tive Americans”) with people of Spanish and English de- 
scent. The usual “Introduction” states that “The author has 
chose a method after the manner of conversations between 
children and their instructor,” and the dialogue is indicated by 
printing the children’s observations in italics. These volumes 
were issued for twenty years after they were introduced by 
Hall, and those of an eighteen hundred Philadelphia edition 
are bound separately. Number one is in blue paper with cop- 
per-plate pictures on both covers. This volume gives informa- 
tion regarding farm produce, live-stock, and about birds quite 
unfamiliar to American children. But the second volume, in 
white covers, introduces the story of Sir Walter Raleigh and 
his pipe-smoking incident, made very realistic in the copper- 
plate frontispiece. The children’s question, “ Did Sir Walter 
Raleigh find out the virtues of tobacco?” affords an excellent 
opportunity for a discourse upon smoking and snuff-taking. 
These remarks conclude with this prosaic statement: “Hun- 
dreds of sensible people have fell into these customs from 
example; and, when they would have left them off, found it 
a very great difficulty.” Next comes a lesson upon the growth 
of tobacco leading up to a short account of the slave-trade, 
already a subject of differing opinion in the United States, 
as well as in England. Of further interest to small Americans 
was a short tale of the discovery of this country. Perhaps to 
most children their first book-knowledge of this event came 
from the pages of “Little Truths.” 
Hall’s books were not all so proper for the amusement 
of young folks. A perusal of “Capt. Gulliver’s Adventures”

leaves one in no doubt as to the reason that so many of the 
old-fashioned mothers preferred to keep such tales out of 
children’s hands, and to read over and over again the adven- 
tures of the Pilgrim, Christian. Mrs. Eliza Drinker of Phila- 
delphia in seventeen hundred and ninety-six was re-reading 
for the third time “ Pilgrim’s Progress,” which she considered 
a “generally approved book,” although then “ridiculed by 
many.” The “Legacy to Children” Mrs. Drinker also read 
aloud to her grandchildren, having herself “wept over it 
between fifty and sixty years ago, as did my grandchil- 
dren when it was read to them. She, Hannah Hill, died in 
1714, and ye book was printed in 1714 by Andrew Brad- 
ford.” 
But Mrs. Drinker’s grandchildren had another book very 
different from the pious sayings of the dying Hannah. This 
contained “64 little stories and as many pictures drawn and 
written by Nancy Skyrin,” the mother of some of the chil- 
dren. P. Widdows had bound the stories in gilt paper, and 
it was so prized by the family that the grandmother thought 
the fact of the recovery of the book, after it was supposed to 
have been irretrievably lost, worthy of an entry in her jour- 
nal. Careful inquiry among the descendants of Mrs. Drinker 
has led to the belief that these stories were read out of exist- 
ence many years ago. What they were about can only be 
imagined. Perhaps they were incidents in the lives of the same 
children who cried over the pathetic morbidity of Hannah’s 
dying words; or possibly rhymes and verses about school 
and play hours of little Philadelphians; with pictures show- 
ing bait-the-bear, trap-ball, and other sports of days long since

passed away, as well as “I Spie Hi” and marbles, familiar still 
to boys and girls. 
From the fact that these stories were written for the au- 
thor’s own children, another book, composed less than a cen- 
tury before, is brought to mind. Comparison of even the mea- 
gre description of Mrs. Skyrin’s book with Cotton Mather’s 
professed purpose in “Good Lessons” shows the stride made 
in children’s literature to be a long one. Yet a quarter of 
a century was still to run before any other original writing 
was done in America for children’s benefit. 
Nobody else in America, indeed, seems to have considered 
the question of writing for nursery inmates. Mrs. Barbauld’s 
“Easy Lessons for Children from Twoto Five Years old,” writ- 
ten for English children, were considered perfe&tly adapted 
to gaining knowledge and perhaps amusement. It is true that 
when Benjamin Bache of Philadelphia issued “Easy Les- 
sons,” he added this note: “Some alterations were thought 
necessary to be made in this . .. American edition, to make it 
agree with the original design of rendering instruction easy 
and useful. ... The climate and the familiar objects of this 
country suggested these alterations.” Except for the substitu- 
tion of such words as “ Wheat” for “Corn,” the intentions of 
the editor seem hardly to have had result, except by way of 
advertisement; and are of interest merely because they repre- 
sent one step further in the direction of Americanizing the 
story-book literature. 
All Mrs. Barbauld’s books were considered excellent for 
young children. As a “Dissenter,” she gained in the esteem 
of the people of the northern states, and her books were im-

ported as well as reprinted here. Perhaps she was best known 
to our grandparents as the joint author, with Dr. Aikin, of 
“Evenings at Home,” and of “Hymns in Prose and Verse.” 
Both were read extensively for fifty years. The “Hymns” had 
an enormous circulation, and were often full of fine rhythm 
and undeserving of the entire neglect into which they have 
fallen. Of course, as the fashion changed in the “approved” 
type of story, Mrs. Barbauld suffered criticism. “Mrs. and Miss 
Edgeworth in their ‘ Practical Education’ insisted that evil 
lurked behind the phrase in ‘Easy Lessons,’ ‘Charles wants 
his dinner’ because of the implication ‘that Charles must 
have whatever he desires,’ and to say ‘the sun has gone tobed,’ 
is to incur the odium of telling the child a falsehood.” * 
But the manner in which these critics of Mrs. Barbauld 
thought they had improved upon her method of story-telling 
is a tale belonging to another chapter. When Miss Edge- 
worth’s wave of popularity reached this country Mrs. Bar- 
bauld’s ideas still flourished as very acceptable to parents. 
A contemporary and rival writer for the English nursery 
was Mrs. Sarah Trimmer. Her works for little children were 
also credited with much information they did not give. After 
the publication of Mrs. Barbauld’s “Easy Lessons” (which 
was the result of her own teaching of an adopted child), Mrs. 
Trimmer’s friends urged her to make a like use of the les- 
sons given to her family of six, and accordingly she pub- 
lished in seventeen hundred and seventy-eight an “Easy 
Introduction into the Knowledge of Nature,” and followed it 
some years after its initial success by “Fabulous Histories,”

afterwards known as the “History of the Robins.” Although 
Mrs. Trimmer represents more nearly than Mrs. Barbauld 
the religious emotionalism pervading Sunday-school libraries, 
—in which she was deeply interested,— the work of both 
these ladies exemplifies the transitional stage to that Labor- 
in-Play school of writing which was to invade the American 
nursery in the next century when Parley and Abbott throve 
upon the proceeds of the educational narrative. 
Defoe’s “Robinson Crusoe” and Thomas Day’s “Sanford 
and Merton” occupied the place in the estimation of boys 
that the doings of Mrs. Barbauld’s and Mrs. Trimmer’s works 
held in the opinion of the younger members of the nursery. 
Edition followed upon edition of the adventures of the famous 
island hero. In Philadelphia, in seventeen hundred and ninety- 
three, William Young issued what purported to be the sixth 
edition. In New York many thousands of copies were sold, 
and in eighteen hundred and twenty-four we find a Spanish 
translation attesting its widespread favor. In seventeen hun- 
dred and ninety-four, Isaiah Thomas placed the surprising 
adventures of the mariner as on the “Coast of America, lying 
near the mouth of the great river Oroonoque.” 
Parents also thought very highly of Thomas Day’s “Chil- 
dren’s Miscellany” and “Sanford and Merton.” To read this 
last book is to believe it to be possibly in the style that 
Dr. Samuel Johnson had in mind when he remarked to 
Mrs. Piozzi that “the parents buy the books but the children 
never read them.” Yet the testimony of publishers of the past 
is that “Sanford and Merton” had a large and continuous sale 
for many years. “‘Sanford and Merton,’” writes Mr. Julian

Hawthorne, “ran ‘Robinson Crusoe’ harder than any other 
work of the eighteenth century particularly written for chil- 
dren.” “The work,” he adds, “is quaint and interesting rather 
to the historian than tothe general, especially the child, reader. 
Children would hardly appreciate so amazingly ancient a form 
of conversation as that which resulted from Tommy [the bad 
boy of the story] losing a ball and ordering a ragged boy to 
pick it up: 
“«Bring my ball dire@ly!’ 
“T don’t choose it,’ said the boy. 
“«Sirrah,’ cried Tommy, ‘if I come to you I will make 
you choose it.’ 
“*Perhaps not, my pretty master,’ said the boy. 
“You little rascal,’ said Tommy, who now began to be 
very angry, ‘if I come over the hedge I will thrash you within 
an inch of your life.’” 
The gist of Tommy’s threat has often been couched in 
modern language by grandsons of the boys from whom the 
Socratic Mr. Day wrote to expose the evils of too luxurious 
an education. His method of compilation of faéts to be taught 
may best be given in the words of his Preface : “ All who have 
been conversant in the education of very young children, 
have complained of the total want of proper books to be put 
in their hands, while they are taught the elements of read- 
ing. ... The least exceptional passages of books that I could 
find for the purpose were ‘ Plutarch’s Lives’ and Xenophon’s 
‘History of the Institution of Cyrus,’ in English translation; 
with some part of ‘Robinson Crusoe,’ and a few passages from 
Mr. Brooke’s ‘Fool of Quality.’ . . . I therefore resolved . . . 
[ 130 ]
-P-A-G-E-165
  American Nursery 
not only to colleé all such stories as I thought adapted to 
the faculties of children, but to connect these by continued 
narration. . . . As to the histories themselves, I have used the 
most unbounded licence. . . . As to the language, I have en- 
deavored to throw into it a greater degree of elegance and 
ornament than is usually to be met with in such compositions; 
preserving at the same time a sufficient degree of simplicity 
to make it intelligible to very young children, and rather 
choosing to be diffuse than obscure.” With these objects in 
mind, we can understand small Tommy’s embellishment of 
his demand for the return of his ball by addressing the ragged 
urchin as “Sirrah.” 
Mr. Day’s “Children’s Miscellany” contained a number of 
stories, of which one, “The History of Little Jack,” about 
a lost child who was adopted by a goat, was popular enough 
to be afterwards published separately. It is a debatable ques- 
tion as to whether the parents or the children figuring in this 
“Miscellany” were the more artificial. “ Proud and unfeeling 
girl,” says one tender mother to her little daughter who had 
bestowed half her pin money upon a poor family, — “proud 
and unfeeling girl, to prefer vain and trifling ornaments to 
the delight of relieving the sick and miserable! Retire from 
my presence! Take away with you trinket and nosegay, and 
receive from them all the comforts they are able to bestow!” 
Why Mr. Day’s stories met with such unqualified praise at 
the time they were published, this example of canting rubbish 
does not reveal. In real life parents certainly did retain some 
of their substance for their own pleasure; why, therefore, dis- 
cipline a child for following the same inclination? 
[ 131 ]

In contrast to Mr. Day’s method, Mrs. Barbauld’s plan of 
simple conversation in words of one, two, and three sylla- 
bles seems modern. Both aimed to afford pleasure to children 
“learning the elements of reading.” Where Mrs. Barbauld 
probably judged truly the capacity of young children in the 
dialogues with the little Charles of “« Easy Lessons,” Mr. Day 
loaded his gun with flowers of rhetoric and overshot infant 
comprehension. 
Nevertheless, in spite of the criticism that has waylaid and 
torn to tatters Thomas Day’s efforts to provide a suitable 
and edifying variety of stories, his method still stands for the 
distin& secularization of children’s literature of amusement. 
Moreover, as Mr. Montrose J. Moses writes in his delightful 
study of “Children’s Books and Reading,” “he foreshadowed 
the method of retelling incidents from the classics and from 
standard history and travel, —a form which is practised to 
a great extent by our present writers, who thread diverse 
materials on a slender wire of subsidiary story, and who, like 
Butterworth and Knox, invent untiring families of travellers 
who go to foreign parts, who see things, and then talk out 
loud about them.” 
Besides tales by English authors, there was a French wo- 
man, Madame de Genlis, whose books many educated people 
regarded as particularly suitable for their daughters, both in 
the original text and in the English translations. In Aaron 
Burr's letters we find references to his interest in the progress 
made by his little daughter, Theodosia, in her studies. His 
zeal in searching for helpful books was typical of the care 
many others took to place the best literature within their 
[ 132 ]  
-P-A-G-E-167
  American Nursery 
children’s reach. From Theodosia’s own letters to her father 
we learn that she was a studious child, who wrote and ci- 
phered from five to eight every morning and during the 
same hours every evening. To improve her French, Mr. Burr 
took pains to find reading-matter when his law praétice ne- 
cessitated frequent absence from home. Thus from West 
Chester, in seventeen hundred and ninety-six, when Theo- 
dosia was nine years old, he wrote: 
I rose up suddenly from the sofa and rubbing my head— 
“What book shall I buy for her?” said I to myself. “She 
reads so much and so rapidly that it is not easy to find proper 
and amusing French books for her; and yet I am so flattered 
with her progress in that language, that I am resolved that 
she shall, at all events, be gratified.” So... I took my hat 
and sallied out. It was not my first attempt. I went into one 
bookseller’s after another. I found plenty of fairy tales and 
such nonsense, for the generality of children of nine or ten 
years old. “These,” said I, “will never do. Her understand- 
ing begins to be above such things.” . . . I began to be dis- 
couraged. “But I will search a little longer.” I persevered. 
At last I found it. I found the very thing I sought. It is con- 
tained in two volumes, octavo, handsomely bound, and with 
prints and reprints. It is a work of fancy but replete with in- 
struction and amusement. I must present it with my own hand.

sented the two volumes upon his return! From a letter written 
later by Mr. Burr to his wife, it appears that he afterward 
found reason to regret his purchase, which seems to have been 
Madame de Genlis’s famous “Annales.” “Your account,” 
he wrote, “of Madame Genlis surprises me, and is new evi- 
dence of the necessity of reading books before we put them in 
the hands of children.” Opinion differed, of course, concerning 
the French lady’s books. In New York, in Miss Dodsworth’s 
most genteel and fashionable school, a play written from “ The 
Dove” by Madame de Genlis was acted with the same zest by 
little girls of ten and twelve years of age as they showed in 
another play taken from “The Search after Happiness,” a 
drama by the Quakeress and religious writer, Hannah More. 
These plays were given at the end of school terms by fond 
parents with that appreciation of the histrionic ability of their 
daughters still to be seen on such occasions. 
No such objection as Mrs. Burr made to this lady’s 
“« Annales” was possible in regard to another French book, by 
Berquin. Entitled “Ami des Enfans,” it received under the 
Rev. Mr. Cooper’s translation the name “The Looking Glass 
for the Mind.” This collection of tales supposedly mirrored 
the frailties and virtues of rich and poor children. It was often 
bound in full calf, and an edition of seventeen hundred and 
ninety-four contains a better engraved frontispiece than it was 
customary to place in juvenile publications. For half a century 
it was to be found in the shop of all booksellers, and had its 
place in the library of every family of means. There are still 
those among us who have not forgotten the impression pro- 
duced upon their infant minds by certain of the tales. Some

remember the cruel child and the canary. Others recollect 
their admiration of the little maid who, when all others de- 
serted her young patroness, lying ill with the smallpox, won 
the undying gratitude of the mother by her tender nursing. 
The author, blind himself to the possibilities of detriment to 
the sick child by unskilled care, held up to the view of all, 
this example of devotion of one girl in contrast to the hard- 
heartedness of many others. This book seems also to have 
been called by the literal translation of its original title, “Ami 
des Enfans;” for in an account of the occupations of one sum- 
mer Sunday in seventeen hundred and ninety-seven, Julia 
Cowles, living in Litchfield, Connecticut, wrote: “ Attended 
meeting all day long, but do not recolle& the text. Read in 
‘The Children’s Friend.’” Many children would not have 
been permitted to read so nearly secular a book; but evidently 
Julia Cowles’s parents were liberal in their view of Sunday 
reading after the family had attended “meeting all day long.” 
In addition to the interest of the context of these toy-books 
of a past generation, one who handles such relics of a cen- 
tury ago sees much of the fashions for children of that day. 
In “The Looking Glass,” for instance, the illustrations copied 
from engravings by the famous English artist, Bewick, show 
that at the end of the eighteenth century children were still 
clothed like their elders; the coats and waistcoats, knee 
breeches and hats, of boys were patterned after gentlemen’s 
garments, and the caps and aprons, kerchiefs and gowns, for 
girls were reproductions of the mothers’ wardrobes. 
Again, the fly-leaf of “The History of Master Jacky and 
Miss Harriot” arrests the eye by its quaint inscription:

“Rozella Ford’s Book. For being the second speller in the 
second class.” At once the imagination calls up the exercises 
ina village school at the end of a year’s session: a row of prim 
little maids and sturdy boys, standing before the school dame 
and by turn spelling in shrill tones words of three to five syl- 
lables, until only two, Rozella and a better speller, remain 
unconfused by Dilworth’s and Webster’s word mysteries. 
Then the two children step forward with bow and curtsey 
to receive their tiny gilt prizes from a pile of duodecimos 
upon the teacher’s desk. Indeed, the giving of rewards was 
carried to such an extent as to become a great drain upon 
the meagre stipend of the teacher. Thus when in copper-plate 
handwriting we find in another six-penny volume the inscrip- 
tion: “Benjamin H. Bailey, from one he esteems and loves, 
Mr. Hapgood,” we read between its lines the self-denial prac- 
tised by Mr. Hapgood, who possibly received, like many 
other teachers, but seventy-five cents a week besides his board 
and lodging. 
Other books afford a glimpse of children’s life: the formal 
every-day routine, the plays they enjoyed, and their demon- 
stration of a sensibility as keen as was then in fashion for 
adults. The “History of a Doll,” lying upon the writer’s 
table, is among the best in this respect. It was evidently 
much read by its owner and fairly “loved to pieces.” When 
it reached this disintegrated stage, a careful mother, or aunt, 
sewed it with coarse flax thread inside a home-made cover 
of bright blue wall-paper. Although the “History of the Ped- 
igree and Rise of the Pretty Doll” bears no date, its com- 
panion story in the wall-paper wrapper has the imprint sev-

enteen hundred and ninety-one, and this, together with the 
press-work, places it as belonging to the eighteenth century. 
It offers to the reader a charming insight into the formality 
of many an old-fashioned family: the deportment stiff with 
the starched customs of that day, the seriousness of their fun, 
and the sensibility among little maidens akin to that exhibited 
in the heroines of fiction created by Richardson and Fielding. 
The chapter concerning “The Pedigree of the Doll” treats 
of finding a branch of a tree by a carver, who was desired 
by Sir John Amiable to make one of the best dolls in his 
power for his “pretty little daughter who was as good as she 
was pretty.” The carver accordingly took the branch and 
began carving out the head, shoulders, body, and legs, which 
he soon brought to their proper shape. “ He then covered it 
with a fine, flesh-colored enamel and painted its cheeks in 
the most lively manner. It had the finest black and spark- 
ling eyes that were ever beheld; its cheeks resembled the 
blushing rose, its neck the lilly, and its lips the coral.” The 
doll is presented, and the next chapter tells of “an assembly 
of little female gossips in full debate on the clothing of the 
doll.” “Miss Polly having made her papa a vast number of 
courtesies for it, prevailed on her brother to go round to all 
the little gossips in the neighborhood, begging their company 
to tea in the afternoon, in order to consult in what mode 
the doll should be dressed.” The company assembled. “Miss 
Micklin undertook to make it a fine ruffled laced shift, Miss 
Mantua to make it a silk sacque and petticoat; and in short, 
every one contributed, in some measure, to dress out this 
beautiful creature.”

“Everything went on with great harmony till they came 
to the head-dress of the doll; and here they differed so much 
in opinion, that all their little clappers were going at once. 
. .. Luckily, at this instant Mrs. Amiable happened to come 
in, and soon brought the little gossips to order. The matter 
in dispute was, whether it should have a high head-dress or 
whether the hair should come down on the forehead, and 
the curls flow in natural ringlets on the shoulders. However, 
after some pretty warm debate, this last mode was adopted, 
as most proper for a little miss.” In chapter third “The doll 
is named:— Accidents attend the Ceremony.” Here we have 
a picture of a children’s party. “The young ladies and gen- 
tlemen were entertained with tea and coffee; and when that 
was over, each was presented with a glass of raisin wine.” 
During the christening ceremony an accident happened to 
the doll, because Master Tommy, the parson, “in endeavour- 
ing to get rid of it before the little gossips were ready to 
receive it, made a sad blunder. . .. Miss Polly, with tears in 
her eyes, snatched up the doll and clasped it to her bosom; 
while the rest of the little gossips turned all the little mas- 
ters out of the room, that they might be left to themselves 
to inquire more privately into what injuries the dear doll had 
received. .. . Amidst these alarming considerations Tommy 
Amiable sent the ladies word, that, if they would permit him 
and the rest of the young gentlemen to pass the evening 
among them in the parlour, he would engage to replace the 
nose of the doll in such a manner that not the appearance 
of the late accident should be seen.” Permission was accord- 
ingly granted for a surgical operation upon the nose, but

“cas to the fracture in one of the doll’s legs, it was never cer- 
tainly known how that was remedied, as the young ladies 
thought it very indelicate to mention anything about the 
matter.” The misadventures of the doll include its theft by 
a monkey in the West Indies, and at this interesting point 
the only available copy of the tale is cut short by the loss of 
the last four pages. The charm of this book lies largely in the 
fact that the owner of the doll does not grow up and marry as 
in almost every other novelette. This difference, of course, 
prevents the story from being a typical one of its period, but 
it is, nevertheless, a worthy forerunner of those tales of the 
nineteenth century in which an effort was made to write 
about incidents in a child’s life, and to avoid the biographical 
tendency. 
Before leaving the books of the eighteenth century, one tale 
must be mentioned because it contains the germ of the idea 
which has developed into Mr. George’s “Junior Republic.” 
It was called “Juvenile Trials for Robbing Orchards, Telling 
Tales and other Heinous Offenses.” “This,” said Dr. Aikin 
—Mrs. Barbauld’s brother and collaborator in “Evenings 
at Home”—“‘is a very pleasing and ingenious little Work, 
in which a Court of Justice is supposed to be instituted in a 
school, composed of the Scholars themselves, for the purpose 
of trying offenses committed at School.” In “Trial the First” 
Master Tommy Tell-Truth charges Billy Prattle with rob- 
bing an orchard. The jury, after hearing Billy express his 
contrition for his act, brings in a verdict of guilty; but the 
judge pardons the culprit because of his repentant frame of 
mind. Miss Delia, the offender in case Number Two, does not

escape so lightly. Miss Stirling charges her with raising con- 
tention and strife among her school-fellows over a piece of 
angelica, “ whereby,” say her prosecutors, “one had her favorite 
cap torn to pieces, and her hair which had been that day nicely 
dressed, pulled all about her shoulders; another had her sack 
torn down the middle; a third had a fine flowered apron of 
her own working, reduced to rags; a fourth was wounded by 
a pelick, or scratch of her antagonist, and in short, there was 
hardly one among them who had not some mark to shew 
of having been concerned in this unfortunate affair.” That 
the good Dr. Aikin approved of the punishment decreed, 
we are sure. The little prisoner was condemned to pass three 
days in her room, as just penalty for such “indelicate” be- 
haviour. 
By the close of the century Miss Edgeworth was beginning 
to supersede Mrs. Barbauld in England; but in America the 
taste in juvenile reading was still satisfied with the older writ- 
er’s little Charles, as the correct model for children’s deport- 
ment, and with Giles Gingerbread as the exemplary student. 
The child’s lessons had passed from “Be good or you will 
go to Hell” to “Be good and you will be rich;” or, with the 
Puritan element still so largely predominant, “Be good and 
you will goto Heaven.” Virtue as an ethical quality had been 
shown in “Goody Two-Shoes” to bring its reward as surely 
as vice brought punishment. It is to be doubted if this was 
altogether wholesome; and it may well be that it was with this 
idea in mind that Dr. Johnson made his celebrated criticism 
of the nursery literature in vogue, when he said to Mrs. Piozzi, 
“Babies do not want to be told about babies; they like to 
[ 140 ]
-P-A-G-E-175
  
  American Nursery 
be told of giants and castles, and of somewhat which can 
stretch and stimulate their little minds.” * 
The learned Doétor, having himself been brought up on 
“Jack the Giant Killer” and “The History of Blue Beard,” 
was inclined to scorn Newbery’s tales as lacking in imagina- 
tive quality. That Dr. Johnson was really interested in stories 
for the young people of his time is attested by a note written 
in seventeen hundred and sixty-three on the fly-leaf of a col- 
lection of chap-books: “I shall certainly, sometime or other, 
write a little Story-Book in the style of these. I shall be happy 
to succeed, for he who pleases children will be remembered 
by them.” + 
In America, however, it is doubtful whether any true criti- 
cal spirit regarding children’s books had been reached. Fortu- 
nately in England, at the beginning of the next century, there 
was a man who dared speak his opinion. Mrs. Barbauld and 
Mrs. Trimmer (who had contributed “Fabulous Histories” 
to the juvenile library, and for them had shared the approval 
which greeted Mrs. Barbauld’s efforts) were the objects of 
Charles Lamb’s particular detestation. In a letter to Coleridge, 
written in 1802, he said: 
“Goody Two Shoes is almoft out of print. Mrs. Barbauld’s 
{tuff haf banifhed all the old claffics of the nurfery, and the

old exploded corner of a fhelf, when Mary afked for them.

no poffibility of arrefting this force of evil? Think what you 
would have been now, if inftead of being fed with tales and 
old wives’ fables in childhood, you had been crammed with 
geography and natural hiftory. Hang them! I mean the curfed 
Barbauld crew, thofe blights and blafts of all that is human 
in man and child.” * 
To Lamb’s extremely sensitive nature, the vanished hand 
of the literary man of Grub Street could not be replaced by 
Mrs. Barbauld’s wish to instrué& by using simple language. 
It is possible that he did hersome injustice. Yet a retrospective 
glance over the story-book literature evolved since Newbery’s 
juvenile library was produced, shows little that was not poor 
in quality and untrue to life. Therefore, it is no wonder that 
Lamb should have cried out against the sore evil which had 
“beset a child’s mind.” All the poetry of life, all the imagi- 
native powers of a child, Mrs. Barbauld, Mrs. Trimmer, and 
Mr. Day ignored; and Newbery in his way, and the old bal- 
lads in their way, had appealed to both. 
In both countries the passion for knowledge resulted in 
this curious literature of amusement. In England books were 
written; in America they were reprinted, until a religious

Toy-Books in the Early Nineteenth Century 
N the 23d of December, 1823, there appeared anony- 
mously in the “Troy (New York) Sentinel,” a Christ- 
mas ballad entitled “ A Visit from St. Nicholas.” This rhymed 
story of Santa Claus and his reindeer, written one year before 
its publication by Clement Clarke Moore for his own family, 
marks the appearance of a truly original story in the literature 
of the American nursery. 
We have seen the somewhat lugubrious influence of Puri- 
tan and Quaker upon the occasional writings for American 
children; and now comes a story bearing upon its face the 
features of a Dutchman, as the jolly old gentleman enters 
nursery lore with his happy errand. 
Up to this time children of wholly English extraction had 
probably little association with the Feast of St. Nicholas. The 
Christmas season had hitherto been regarded as pagan in its 
origin by people of Puritan or Scotch descent, and was cele- 
brated only as a religious festival by the descendants of the 
more liberal adherents to the Church of England. The Dutch 
element in New York, however, still clung to some of their 
traditions; and the custom of exchanging simple gifts upon 
Christmas Day had come down to them as a result of a com- 
bination of the church legend of the good St. Nicholas, pa- 
tron of children, and the Scandinavian myth of the fairy gnome, 
who from his bower in the woods showered good children with

gifts.* But to celebrate the day quietly was altogether a differ- 
ent thing from introducing to the American public the char- 
acter of Santa Claus, who has become in his mythical entity as 
well known to every American as that other Dutch legendary 
personage, Rip Van Winkle. 
In the “ Visit from St. Nicholas” Mr. Moore not only intro- 
duced Santa Claus to the young folk of the various states, but 
gave to them their first story of any lasting merit whatsoever. 
It is worthy of remark that as every impulse to write for juve- 
nile readers has lagged behind the desire to write for adults, 
so the composition of these familiar verses telling of the 
arrival in America of the mysterious and welcome visitor on 
“The night before Christmas, when all through the house 
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse,” 
fell at the end of that quarter of the nineteenth century to 
which we are accustomed to refer as the beginning of the 
national period of American literature. 
It is, of course, true that the older children of that period 
had already begun to enjoy some of the writings of Irving and 
Cooper, and to learn the fortunately still familiar verses by 
Hopkinson, Key, Drake, and Halleck. School-readers have 
served to familiarize generation after generation with “ Hail 
Columbia,” “The Star Spangled Banner,” and sometimes 
with “The American Flag.” It is, doubtless, their authors’ 
jubilant enthusiasm over the freedom of the young Republic 
that has caused the children of the more mature nation to 
delight in the repetition of the patriotic verses. The youth- 
*As long ago as seventeen hundred and sixty-two, Garrat Noel, a Dutch bookseller in 
New York, advertised that, “according to his Annual Custom, he . . . provided a very large 
Assortment of Books . . . as proper Presents at Christmas.” See page 68.

ful extravagance of expression pervading every line is re- 
echoed in the heart of the schoolboy, who likes to imagine 
himself, before anything else, a patriot. But until “Donder 
and Blitzen” pranced into the foreground as Santa Claus’ 
steeds, there was nothing in American nursery literature of 
any lasting fame. Thereafter, as the custom of observing 
Christmas Day gradually became popular, the perennial 
small child felt—until automobiles sent reindeer to the 
limbo of bygone things—the thrill of delight and fear over 
the annual visit of Santa Claus that the bigger child expe- 
riences in exploding fire-crackers on the Fourth of July. 
There are possibilities in both excitements which appeal to 
one of the child’s dearest possessions — his imagination. 
It is this dire&t appeal to the imagination that surprises 
and delights us in Mr. Moore’s ballad. To re-read it is to 
be amazed that anything so full of merriment, so modern, 
so free from pompousness or condescension, from pedantry 
or didacticism, could have been written before the latter half 
of the nineteenth century. Not only its style is simple in con- 
trast with the labored efforts at simplicity of its contempo- 
raneous verse, but its story runs fifty years ahead of its time 
in its freedom from the restraining hand of the moralist and 
from the warning finger of the religious teacher, if we except 
Nathaniel Hawthorne’s “ Wonder Book.” 
In our examination of the toy-books of twenty years pre- 
ceding its publication, we shall find nothing so attractive in 
manner, nor so imaginative in conception. Indeed, we shall 
see, upon the one hand, that fun was held in with such a tight 
curb that it hardly ever escaped into print; and upon the other 
[ 149 J  
-P-A-G-E-184
  Forgotten Books of the 
hand that the imagination had little chance to develop because 
of the prodigal indulgence in realities and in religious experi- 
ence from which all authors suffered. We shall also see that 
these realities were made very uncompromising and uncom- 
fortable to run counter to. Duty spelled in capital letters was 
a stumbling-block with which only the well-trained story-book 
child could successfully cope; recreation followed in small 
portions large shares of instruction, whether disguised or bare 
faced. The Religion-in-Play, the Ethics-in-Play, and the Labor- 
in-Play schools of writing for children had arrived in America 
from the land of their origin. 
The stories in vogue in England during this first quarter 
of the nineteenth century explain every vagary in America. 
There fashionable and educational authorities had hitched 
their wagon to the literary star, Miss Edgeworth, and the fol- 
lowers of her system; while the religiously inclined pinned 
their faith also upon traéts written by Miss Hannah More. In 
this still imitative land the booksellers simply reprinted the 
more successful of these juvenile publications. The changes, 
therefore, in the chara¢ter of the juvenile literature of amuse- 
ment of the early nineteenth century in America were due to 
the adoption of the works of these two Englishwomen, and 
to the increased facilities for reproducing toy-books, both in 
press-work and in illustrations. 
Hannah More’s allegories and religious dramas, written to 
coéperate with the teachings of the first Sabbath Day schools, 
are, of course, outside the literature of amusement. Yet they - 
affected its type in America as they undoubtedly gave direc- 
tion to the efforts of the early writers for children. 
[ 150 ]

Miss More, born in seventeen hundred and fifty-four, was 
a woman of already established literary reputation when her 
attention was attracted by Robert Raikes’s successful experi- 
ment of opening a Sunday-school, in seventeen hundred and 
eighty-one. During the religious revival that attended the 
preaching of George Whitefield, Raikes, already interested 
in the hardships and social condition of the working-classes, 
was further aroused by his intimate knowledge of the manner 
of life of some children in a pin factory. To provide instruc- 
tion for these child laborers, who, without work or restrictions 
on Sundays, sought occupation far from elevating, Raikes 
founded the first “Sabbath Day school.” 
The movement spread rapidly in England, and ten years 
later, in seventeen hundred and ninety-one, under the inspira- 
tion of Bishop White, the pioneer First Day school in America 
was opened in Philadelphia. The good Bishop was disturbed 
mentally by the religious and moral degeneracy of the poor 
children in his diocese, and annoyed during church services 
by their clamor outside the churches—a noise often sufficient 
to drown the prayers of his flock and the sermons of his clergy. 
To occupy these restless children for a part of the day, two 
sessions of the school were held each Sunday: one before the 
morning service, from eight until half-past ten o’clock, and 
the other in the afternoon for an hour and a half. The Bible 
was used asa reader, and the teaching was done regularly by 
paid instructors. 
The first Sunday-school library owed its origin toa wish to 
further the instru€tion given in the school, and hence contained 
books thought admirably adapted to Sunday reading. Among 
be

the somewhat meagre stock provided for this purpose were 
Doddridge’s “Power of Religion,” Miss More’s tracts and 
the writings of her imitators, together with “The Fairchild 
Family,” by Mrs. Sherwood, “The Two Lambs,” by Mrs. 
Cameron, “The Economy of Human Life,” and a little volume 
made up of selections from Mrs. Barbauld’s works for chil- 
dren. “The Economy of Human Life,” said Miss Sedgwick 
(who herself afterwards wrote several good books for girls), 
“‘was quite above my comprehension, and I thought it un- 
meaning and tedious.” Testimony of this kind about a book 
which for years appeared regularly upon booksellers’ lists 
enables us to realize that the average intelligent child of the 
year eighteen hundred was beginning to be as bored by some 
of the literature placed in his hands as a child would be one 
hundred years later. 
To increase this special class of books, Hannah More de- 
voted her attention. Her forty tracts comprising “The Cheap 
Repository” included “The Shepherd of Salisbury Plain” 
and “The Two Shoemakers,” which, often appearing in 
American booksellers’ advertisements, were for many years 
a staple article in Sunday-school libraries, and even now, al- 
though pushed to the rear, are discoverable in some such col- 
lections of books, Their objective point is best given by their 
author’s own words in the preface to an edition of “The Search 
after Happiness; A Pastoral Drama,” issued by Jacob Johnson 
of Philadelphia in eighteen hundred and eleven. 
Miss More began in the self-depreciatory manner then 
thought modest and becoming in women writers: “The au- 
thor is sensible it may have many imperfections, but if it may

be happily instrumental in producing a regard to Religion 
and Virtue in the minds of Young Persons, and afford them an 
innocent, and perhaps not altogether unuseful amusement in 
the exercise of recitation, the end for which it was originally 
composed . . . will be fully answered.” A drama may seem to 
us above the comprehension of the poor and illiterate class of 
people whose attention Miss More wished to hold, but when 
we feel inclined to criticise, let us not forget that the author was 
one who had written little eight-year-old Thomas Macaulay: 
“T think we have nearly exhausted the epics. What say you to 
a little good prose ? Johnson’s ‘ Hebrides,’ or Walton’s‘ Lives,’ 
unless you would like a neat edition of Cowper’s poems or 
‘Paradise Lost.’” 
Miss More’s influence upon the character of Sunday-school 
books in England undoubtedly did much to incline many 
unknown American women of the nineteenth century to take 
up this class of books as their own field for religious effort 
and pecuniary profit. 
Contemporary with Hannah More’s writings in the interest 
of religious life of Sunday-school scholars were some of the 
literary produéts of the painstaking pen of Maria Edgeworth. 
Mention of Miss Edgeworth has already been made. About 
her stories for children criticism has played seriously, admir- 
ingly, and contemptuously. It is not the present purpose, how- 
ever, to do other than to make clear her own aim, and to try 
to show the effect of her extremely moral tales upon her own 
generation of writers for American children. It is possible that 
she affected these authors more than the child audience for 
whom she wrote. Little ones have a wonderful faculty for seiz-

ing upon what suits them and leaving the remainder for their 
elders to discuss. 
Maria Edgeworth’s life was a long one. Born in seventeen 
hundred and sixty-seven, when John Newbery’s books were 
at the height of their fame, she lived until eighteen hundred 
and forty-nine, when they were scarcely remembered; and 
now her own once popular tales have met a similar fate. 
She was educated by a father filled with enthusiasm by 
the teachings of Rousseau and with advice from the platitu- 
dinous family friend, Thomas Day, author of “Sanford and 
Merton.” Only the truly genial nature and strong character of 
Miss Edgeworth prevented her genius from being altogether 
swamped by this incongruous combination. Fortunately, also, 
her busy practical home life allowed her sympathies full 
sway and counteracted many of the theories introduced by 
Mr. Edgeworth into his family circle. Successive stepmothers 
filled the Edgeworth nursery with children, for whom the 
devoted older sister planned and wrote the stories afterward 
published. 
In seventeen hundred and ninety-one Maria Edgeworth, 
at her father’s suggestion, began to note down anecdotes of 
the children of the family, and later these were often used as 
copy to be criticised by the little ones themselves before they 
were turned over to the printer. Her father’s educational con- 
versations with his family were often committed to paper, and 
these also furnished material from which Miss Edgeworth 
made it her object in life to interweave knowledge, amuse- 
ment, and ethics. Indeed, it has been most aptly said that 
between the narrow banks of Richard Edgeworth’s theories

“his daughter’s genius flowed through many volumes of 
amusement.” 
Her first collection of tales was published under the title 
of “ The Parent’s Assistant,” although Miss Edgeworth’s own 
choice of a name had been the less formidable one of “The 
Parent’s Friend.” Based upon her experience as eldest sister 
in a large and constantly increasing family, these tales neces- 
sarily struck many true notes and gave valuable hints to per- 
plexed parents. In “The Parent’s Assistant” realities stalked 
full grown into the nursery as 
«Every object in creation 
Furnished hints for contemplation.” 
The characters were invariably true to their creator’s original 
drawing. A good girl was good from morning to night; a 
naughty child began and ended the day in disobedience, and 
by it bottles were smashed, strawberries spilled, and lessons 
disregarded in unbroken sequence. In later life Miss Edge- 
worth confessed to having occasionally introduced in “ Harry 
and Lucy” some nonsense as an “alloy to make the sense 
work well;” but as all her earlier children’s tales were sub- 
jected to the pruning scissors of Mr. Edgeworth, this amal- 
gam is to-day hardly noticeable in “Popular Tales,” “Early 
Lessons,” and “Frank,” which preceded the six volumes of 
“Harry and Lucy.” 
Although a contemporary of Mrs. Barbauld, who had 
written for little children “Easy Lessons,” Miss Edgeworth 
does not seem to have been well known in America until 
about eighteen hundred and five. Then “ Harry and Lucy” 
was brought out by Jacob Johnson, a Philadelphia book- 
[15] 
 
-P-A-G-E-192
  Forgotten Books of the 
dealer. This was issued in six small red and blue marbled 
paper volumes, although other parts were not completed 
until eighteen hundred and twenty-three. Between the first 
and second parts of volume one the educational hand of 
Mr. Edgeworth is visible in the insertion of a “Glossary,” 
“to give a popular meaning of the words.” “ This Glossary,” 
the editor, Mr. Edgeworth, thought, “should be read to chil- 
dren a little at a time, and should be made the subject of con- 
versation. Afterwards they will read it with more pleasure.” 
The popular meaning of words may be succinétly given by 
one definition: “Dry, what is not wet.” Could anything be 
more lucid? 
Among the stories by Miss Edgeworth are three rarely 
mentioned by critics, and yet among the most natural and 
entertaining of her short tales. They were also printed by 
Jacob Johnson in Philadelphia, in eighteen hundred and five, 
under the simple title, “Three Stories for Children.” “Little 
Dog Trusty ” is a dog any small child would like to read about; 
“The Orangeman” was a character familiar to English chil- 
dren; and “The Cherry Orchard” is a tale of a day’s pleasure 
whose spirit American children could readily seize. In each 
Miss Edgeworth had a story to tell, and she told it well, even 
though “she walked,” as has been often said, “as mentor 
beside her characters.” 
Of Miss Edgeworth’s many tales, “Waste Not, Want 
Not” was long considered a model. In it what Mr. Edgeworth 
styled the “shafts of ridicule” were aimed at the rich nephew 
of Mr. Gresham. Mr. Gresham (whose prototype we strongly 
suspect was Mr. Edgeworth himself) “lived neither in idle- 
[256]
-P-A-G-E-193

ness nor extravagance,” and was desirous of adopting an 
heir to his considerable property. Therefore, he invited two 
nephews to visit him, with the object of choosing the more 
suitable for his purpose; apparently he had only to signify 
his wish and no parental objection to his plan would be inter- 
posed. The boys arrive: Hal, whose mama spends her days 
at Bath over cards with Lady Diana Sweepstake, is an ill- 
bred child, neither deferential to his uncle, nor with appe- 
tite for buns when queen-cakes may be had. His cousin Ben, 
on the contrary, has been taught those virtuous habits that 
make for a respectful attitude toward rich uncles and assure a 
dissertation upon the beneficial effe& of buns versws queen- 
cakes. The boys, having had their characters thus definitely 
shown, proceed to live up to them in every particular. From 
start to finish it is the virtuous Ben—his generosity, thrift, 
and foresight are never allowed to lapse for an instant— who 
triumphs in every episode. He saves his string, “good whip- 
cord,” when requested by Mr. Gresham to untie a parcel, and 
it thereafter serves to spin a fine new top, to help Hal out of 
a difficulty with his toy, and in the final incident of the story, 
an archery contest, our provident hero, finding his bowstring 
“cracked,” calmly draws from his pocket the still excellent 
piece of cord, and affixing it to his bow, wins the match. 
Hal betrays his great lack of self-control by exclaiming, “ The 
everlasting whipcord, I declare,” and thereupon Patty, Mr. 
Gresham’s only child, who has suffered from Hal’s defects 
of charaéter, openly rejoices when the prize is given to Ben. 
As is usual with Miss Edgeworth’s badly behaved children, 
the reader now sees the error of Hal’s ways, and perceives

also that in the lad’s acknowledgment of the truth of the 
formerly scorned motto, “ Waste not, want not,” the era of 
his reformation has begun. 
Perpetual action was the key to the success of Miss Edge- 
worth’s writings. If to us her fictitious children seem like 
puppets whose strings are too obviously jerked, the monoto- 
nous moral cloaked in the variety of incident was liked by 
her own generation, 
Miss Edgeworth not only pleased the children, but received 
the applause of their parents and friends. Sir Walter Scott, 
the prince of story-tellers, found much to admire in her tales, 
and wrote of “Simple Susan:” “ When the boy brings back 
the lamb to the little girl, there is nothing for it but to put 
down the book and cry.” Susan was the pattern child in the 
tale, “clean as well as industrious,” while Barbara —a violent 
contrast — was conceited and lazy, and a /ady who “could 
descend without shame from the height of insolent pride to 
the lowest measure of fawning familiarity.” Therefore it is 
small wonder that Sir Walter passed her by without mention. 
However much we may value an English author’s admira- 
tion for Miss Edgeworth’s story-telling gifts, it is to America 
that we naturally turn to seek contemporary opinion. In edu- 
cational circles there is no doubt that Miss Edgeworth won 
high praise. That her books were not always easy to procure, 
however, we know from a letter written from Washington by 
Mrs. Josiah Quincy, whose life as a child during the Revolu- 
tion has already been described. When Mrs. Quincy was liv- 
ing in the capital city in eighteen hundred and ten, during her 
husband’s term as Congressman, she found it difficult to pro- 
[ 158 ]

vide her family with books. She therefore wrote to Boston to 
a friend, requesting to have sent her Miss Edgeworth’s “ Moral 
Tales,” “if the work can be obtained in one of the bookstores. 
If not,” she continued, “borrow one .. . and I will replace it 
with a new copy. Cut the book out of its binding and enclose 
the pages in packets. . .. Be careful to send the entire text and 
title page.” The scarcity in Washington of books for young 
people Mrs, Quincy thought justified the hope that reprinting 
these tales would be profitable to a bookseller in whose efforts 
to introduce a better taste among the inhabitants she took 
a keen interest. But Mrs. Quincy need not have sent to Boston 
for them. Jacob Johnson in Philadelphia had issued most of 
the English author’s books by eighteen hundred and five, and 
New York publishers probably made good profit by printing 
them. 
Reading aloud was both a pastime and an education to 
families in those early days of the Republic. Although Mrs. 
Quincy made every effort to procure Miss Edgeworth’s stories 
for her family because, in her opinion, “they obtained a de- 
cided preference to the works of Hannah More, Mrs. Trim- 
mer and Mrs. Chapone,” for reading aloud she chose extracts 
from Shakespeare, Milton, Addison, and Goldsmith. Indeed, 
if it were possible to ask our great-grandparents what books 
they remembered reading in their childhood, I think we 
should find that beyond somewhat hazy recollections of Miss 
Edgeworth’s books and Berquin’s “The Looking Glass for 
the Mind,” they would either mention “Robinson Crusoe,” 
Newbery’s tales of “Giles Gingerbread,” “Little King Pip- 
pin,” and “Goody Two-Shoes” (written fifty years before 
[ 159 ]

their own childhood), or remember only the classic tales and 
sketches read to them by their parents. 
Certainly this is the case if we may take as trustworthy the 
recollections of literary people whose childhood was passed 
in the first part of the nineteenth century. Catharine Sedg- 
wick, for instance, has left a charming picture of Ameri- 
can family life in a country town in eighteen hundred—a 
life doubtless paralleled by many households in comfortable 
circumstances. Among the host of little prigs and prudes 
in story-books of the day, it is delightful to find in Catha- 
tine Sedgwick herself an example of a bookish child who 
was natural. Her reminiscences include an account of the 
way the task of sweeping out the schoolhouse after hours was 
made bearable by feasts of Malaga wine and raisins. These 
she procured from the store where her father kept an open 
account, until the bill having been rendered dotted over with 
such charges “per daughter Catharine,” these treats to favorite 
schoolmates ceased. Also a host of intimate details of this large 
family’s life in the country brings us in touch with the times: 
fifteen pairs of calfskin shoes ordered from the village shoe- 
maker, because town-bought morocco slippers were few and 
far between; the excitement of a silk gown; the distress of 
a brother, whose trousers for féte occasions were remodelled 
from an older brother’s “blue broadcloth worn to fragility — 
so that Robert [the younger brother] said he could not look 
at them without making a rent;” and again the anticipation 
of the father’s return from Philadelphia with gifts of necessa- 
ries and books. 
After seventeen hundred and ninety-five Mr. Sedgwick was 
[ 160 ]
-P-A-G-E-197
  
American Nursery 
compelled as a member of Congress to be away the greater 
part of each year, leaving household and farm to the care 
of an invalid wife. Memories of Mr. Sedgwick’s infrequent 
visits home were mingled in his daughter’s mind with the 
recollections of being kept up until nine o’clock to listen to 
his reading from Shakespeare, Don Quixote, or Hudibras. 
“Certainly,” wrote Miss Sedgwick, “I did not understand 
them, but some glances of celestial light reached my soul, 
and I caught from his magnetic sympathy some elevation 
of feeling, and that love of reading which has been to me 
an ‘education.’” “I was not more than twelve years old,” she 
continues, “I think but ten—when one winter I read Rollin’s 
Ancient History. The walking to our schoolhouse was often 
bad, and I took my lunch (how well I remember the bread 
and butter, and ‘nut cake’ and cold sausage, and nuts and 
apples that made the miscellaneous contents of that enchant- 
ing lunch-basket!), and in the interim between morning and 
afternoon school I crept under my desk (the desks were so 
made as to afford little close recesses under them) and read 
and munched and forgot myself in Cyrus’ greatness.” 
It is beyond question that the keen relish induced by the 
scarcity of juvenile reading, together with the sound diges- 
tion it promoted, overbalanced in mental gain the novelties 
of a later day. 
The Sedgwick library was probably typical of the average 
choice in reading-matter of the contemporary American child. 
Half a dozen little story-books, Berquin’s “Children’s Friend” 
(the very form and shade of color of its binding with its green 
edges were never forgotten by any member of the Sedgwick 
[ 161 ]
-P-A-G-E-198
re 
Forgotten Books of the 
family), and the “Looking Glass for the Mind” were shelved 
side by side with a large volume entitled “ Elegant Extracts,” 
full of ballads, fables, and tales delightful to children whose 
imagination was already excited by the solemn mystery of 
Rowe’s “Letters from the Dead to the Living.” Since none of 
these books except those containing an infusion of religion 
were allowed to be read on Sunday, the Sedgwick children 
extended the bounds by turning over the pages of a book, 
and if the word “God” or “Lord” appeared, it was pounced 
upon as sanctified and therefore permissible. 
Where families were too poor to buy story-books, the chil- 
dren found what amusement they could in the parents’ small 
library. In ministers’ families sermons were more plentiful 
than books. Mrs. H. B. Stowe, when a girl, found barrels of 
sermons in the garret of her father, the Rev. Dr. Beecher, in 
Litchfield, Connecticut. Through these sermons his daughter 
searched hungrily for mental food. It seemed as if there were 
thousands of the most unintelligible things. “An appeal on 
the unlawfulness of a man’s marrying his wife’s sister” turned 
up in every barrel by the dozens, until she despaired of finding 
an end of it. At last an ancient volume of “ Arabian Nights” 
was unearthed. Here was the one inexhaustible source of   delight toa child so eager for books that at ten years of age 
she had pored over the two volumes of the “Magnalia.” 
The library advantages of a more fortunately placed old- 
fashioned child we know from Dr. Holmes’s frequent refer- 
ence to incidents of his boyhood. He frankly confessed that 
he read in and not through many of the two thousand books in 
his father’s library; but he found much to interest him in the 
[ 162 ]
-P-A-G-E-199
  
American Nursery 
volumes of periodicals, especially in the “Annual Register” 
and Rees’s “Encyclopedia.” Although apparently allowed to 
choose from the book-shelves, there were frequent evidences 
ofa parent’s careful supervision. “I remember,” he once wrote 
toa friend, “many leaves were torn out of a copy of Dryden’s 
Poems, with the comment ‘ Hiatus haud diflendus,’ but I had 
like all children a kind of Indian sagacity in the discovery of 
contraband reading, such as a boy carries to a corner for peru- 
sal. Sermons I had enough from the pulpit. I don’t know that 
I ever read one sermon of my own accord during my child- 
hood. The ‘Life of David, by Samuel Chandler, had adven- 
tures enough, to say nothing of gallantry, in it to stimulate 
and gratify curiosity.” “Biographies of Pious Children,” wrote 
Dr. Holmes at another time, “were not to my taste. Those 
young persons were generally sickly, melancholy, and buzzed 
around by ghostly comforters or discomforters in a way that 
made me sick to contemplate.” Again, Dr. Holmes, writing 
of the revolt from the commonly accepted religious doctrines 
he experienced upon reading the Rev. Thomas Scott’s Family 
Bible, contrasted the gruesome doétrines it set forth with the 
story of Christian told in “Pilgrim’s Progress,” a book which 
captivated his imagination. 
As to story-books, Dr. Holmes once referred to Mrs. 
Barbauld and Dr. Aikin’s joint production, “Evenings at 
Home,” with an accuracy bearing testimony to his early love 
for natural science. He also paid a graceful tribute to Lady 
Bountiful of “Little King Pippin” in comparing her in a 
conversation “At the Breakfast Table” with the appearance 
of three maiden ladies “rustling through the aisles of the 
BS]

  Forgotten Books of the 
old meeting-house, in silk and satin, not gay but more than 
decent.” 
Although Dr. Holmes was not sufficiently impressed with 
the contents of Miss Edgeworth’s tales to mention them, at 
least one of her books contained much of the sort of informa- 
tion he found attractive in “Evenings at Home.” “Harry and 
Lucy,” besides pointing a moral on every page, foreshadowed 
that taste for natural science which turned every writer's 
thought toward printing geographical walks, botanical ob- 
servations, natural history conversations, and geological dis- 
sertations in the guise of toy-books of amusement. A batch of 
books issued in America during the first two decades of the 
nineteenth century is illustrative of this new fashion. These 
books, belonging to the Labor-in-Play school, may best be 
described in their American editions. 
One hundred years ago the American publishers of toy 
works were devoting their attention to the make-up rather 
than to the contents of their wares. The steady progress of the 
industrial arts enabled a greater number of printers to issue 
juvenile books, whose attractiveness was increased by better 
illustrations; and also with the improved facilities for printing 
and publishing, the issues of the various firms became more 
individual. At the beginning of the century the cheaper books 
entirely lost their charming gilt, flowery Dutch, and silver 
wrappers, as home produéts came into use. Size and illustra- 
tions also underwent a change. 
In Philadelphia, Benjamin and Jacob Johnson, and later 
Johnson and Warner, issued both tiny books two inches 
square, and somewhat larger volumes containing illustrations

as well as text. These firms used for binding gray and blue 
marbled paper, gold-powdered yellow cardboard, or salmon 
pink, blue, and olive-green papers, usually without ornamen- 
tation. In eighteen hundred J. and J. Crukshank, of the same 
town, began to decorate with copper-plate cuts the outside of 
the white or blue paper covers of their imprints for children. 
Other printers followed their example, especially after wood- 
engraving became more generally used. 
In Wilmington, Delaware, John Adams printed and sold 
“The New History of Blue Beard” in both peacock-blue and 
olive-green paper covers; but Peter Brynberg, also of that town, 
was still in eighteen hundred and four using quaint wall-paper 
to dress his toy imprints. Matthew Carey, the well-known 
printer of school-books for the children of Philadelphia, made 
a “ Child’s Guide to Spelling and Reading” more acceptable 
by a charming cover of yellow and red striped paper dotted 
over with little black hearts suggestive of the old Primer 
thyme for the letter B: 
“My Book and Heart 
Shall never part.” 
In New York the dealers in juvenile books seem either to 
have bound in calf such classics as “The Blossoms of Moral- 
ity,” published by David Longworth at the Shakespeare Gal- 
lery in eighteen ‘hundred and two, or in decorated but unat- 
tractive brown paper. This was the cover almost invariably 
used for years by Samuel Wood, the founder of the present 
publishing-house of medical works. He began in eighteen 
hundred and six to print the first of his many thousands of 
children’s religious, instructive, and nursery books. As was the 
[ 165 ]

custom in order to insure a good sale, Wood first brought 
out a primer, “The Young Child’s A B C.” He decorated 
its Quaker gray cover with a woodcut of a flock of birds, 
and its title-page with a picture, presumably by Alexander 
Anderson, of a girl holding up a dove in her left hand and 
holding down a lamb with her right. 
In New England, Nathaniel Coverly of Salem sometimes 
used a watered pink paper to cover his sixteen page toy- 
books, and in Boston his son, as late as eighteen hundred 
and thirteen, still used pieces of large patterned wall-paper 
for six-penny books, such as “Tom Thumb,” “Old Mother 
Hubbard,” and “Cock Robin.” 
The change in the appearance of most toy-books, how- 
ever, was due largely to the increased use of illustrations. The 
work of the famous English engraver, Thomas Bewick, had 
at last been successfully copied by a physician of New York, 
Dr. Alexander Anderson. 
Dr. Anderson was born in New York in seventeen hun- 
dred and seventy-five, and by seventeen hundred and ninety- 
three was employed by printers and publishers in New York, 
New Jersey, Philadelphia, and even Charleston to illustrate 
their books. Like other engravers, he began by cutting in 
type-metal, or engraving upon copper. In seventeen hundred 
and ninety-four, for Durell of New York, he undertook to 
make illustrations, probably for “The Looking Glass for the 
Mind.” Beginning by copying Bewick’s pictures upon type- 
metal, when “about one-third done, Dr. Anderson felt satis- 
fied he could do better on wood.” * In his diary we find noted

an instance of his perseverance in the midst of discourage- 
ment: “Sept. 24. This morning I was quite discouraged 
on seeing a crack in the wood. Employed as usual at the 
Doctor’s, came home to dinner, glued the wood and began 
again with fresh hopes of producing a good wood engrav- 
ing.” September 26 found him “pretty well satisfied with 
the impression and so was Durell.” In eighteen hundred he 
engraved all the pictures on wood for a new edition of the 
same book, and from this time he seems to have discontin- 
ued the use of type-metal, which he had employed in his 
earlier work as illustrator of the “Pilgrim’s Progress” issued 
by Hugh Gaine, and of “Tom Thumb’s Folio” printed by 
Brewer. After eighteen hundred and twelve Anderson almost 
gave up engraving on copper also, and devoted himself to 
satisfying the great demand for his work on wood. For Durell 
of New York, an extensive reprinter of English books, from 
toy-books to a folio edition of Josephus, he reproduced the 
English engravings, never making, according to Mr. Lossing, 
more than a frontispiece for the larger volumes. 
Although Samuel Wood and Sons of New York also 
gave Dr. Anderson many orders for cuts for their various 
juvenile publications, he still found time to engrave for pub- 
lishers of other cities. We find his illustrations in the toy- 
books printed in Boston and Philadelphia; and for Sidney 
Babcock, a New Haven publisher of juvenile literature, he 
supplied many of the numerous woodcuts required. The 
best of Anderson’s work as an engraver coincided with the 
years of Babcock’s very extensive business of issuing chil- 
dren’s books, between 1805 and 1840. His cuts adorned the 
[ 167 ]  
-P-A-G-E-206
  Forgotten Books of the 
juvenile duodecimos that this printer’s widely extended trade 
demanded; and even as far south as Charleston, South Caro- 
lina, Babcock, like Isaiah Thomas, found it reais to 
open a branch shop. 
Anderson’s illustrations are the main features of most of 
Babcock’s little blue, pink, and yellow paper-covered books; 
especially of those printed in the early years of the nineteenth 
century. We notice in them the changes in the dress of chil- 
dren, who no longer were clothed exaétly in the semblance 
of their elders, but began to assume garments more appro- 
priate to their ages, sports, and occupations. Anderson also 
sometimes introduced into his pictures a negro coachman 
or nurse in the place of the footman or maid of the English 
tale he illustrated. 
While the demand for the engraver’s work was constant, 
his remuneration was small, if we are to judge by Babcock’s 
payment of only fifty shillings for fifteen cuts. 
For these toy-books Anderson made many reproductions 
from Bewick’s cuts, and although he did not equal the Eng- 
lishman’s work, he so far surpassed his pupils and imitators 
of the early part of the century that his engravings are gen- 
erally to be recognized even when not signed. In eighteen 
hundred and two Dr. Anderson began to reproduce for David 
Longworth Bewick’s “Quadrupeds,” and these “cuts were 
afterwards made use of, with the Bewick letter-press also, for 
a series of children’s books.” * 
In eighteen hundred and twelve, for Munroe & Francis of 
Boston, Dr. Anderson made after J. Thompson a set of cuts,

mainly remarkable “as the chief of his few departures from 
the style of his favorite, Bewick.”* 
The custom of not signing either text or engravings in 
the children’s books has made it difficult to identify writers 
and illustrators of juvenile literature. But some of the best 
engravers undoubtedly practised their art on these toy-books. 
Nathaniel Dearborn, who was a stationer, printer, and en- 
graver in Boston about eighteen hundred and eleven, some- 
times signed the full-page illustrations on both wood and 
copper, and Abel Bowen, a copper-engraver, and possibly 
the first wood-engraver in Boston, signed a very curious pub- 
lication entitled “A Metamorphosis ”—a manifold paper 
which in its various possible combinations transformed one 
figure into another in keeping with the progress of the story. 
C. Gilbert, a pupil of Mason, who had introduced the art 
of wood-engraving in Philadelphia from Boston, engraved on 
wood certainly the two full-page illustrations for “ A Present 
for a Little Girl,” printed in eighteen hundred and sixteen for 
a Baltimore firm, Warner & Hanna. 
Adams and his pupils, Lansing and Morgan, also did work 
on children’s books. Adams seems to have worked under An- 
derson’s instruction, and after eighteen hundred and twenty- 
five did cuts for some books in the juvenile libraries of 
S. Wood and Mahlon Day of New York. 
Of the engravers on copper, many tried their hands on these 
toy-books. Among them may be mentioned Amos Doolittle 
of New Haven, James Poupard, John Neagle, and W. Ralph 
of Philadelphia, and Rollinson of New York, who is credited

Washington on his inauguration as President. 
But of the copper-plate engravers, perhaps none did more 
work for children’s books than William Charles of Philadel- 
phia. Charles, who is best known by his series of caricatures 
of the events of the War of 1812 and of local politics, worked 
upon toy-books as early as eighteen hundred and eight, when 
in Philadelphia he published in two parts “Tom the Piper’s 
Son; illustrated with whimsical engravings.” In these books 
both text and pictures were engraved, as will be seen in the 
illustration. Charles’s plates for a series of moral tales in verse 
were used by his successors, Mary Charles, Morgan & Yea- 
ger, and Morgan & Sons, for certainly fifteen years after the 
originals were made. To William Charles the children in the 
vicinity of Philadelphia were also probably indebted for 
the introduction of colored pictures. It is possible that the 
young folks of Boston had the novelty of colored picture- 
books somewhat before Charles introduced them in Phila- 
delphia, as we find that “The History and Adventures of 
Little Henry exemplified in a series of figures” was printed 
by J. Belcher of the Massachusetts town in 1812. These 
“figures” exhibited little Henry suitably attired for the various 
incidents of his career, with a movable head to be attached 
at will to any of the figures, which were not engraved with 
the text, but each was laid in loose on a blank page. William 
Charles’s method of coloring the pictures engraved with the 
text was a slight advance, perhaps, upon the illustrations in- 
serted separately; but it is doubtful whether these immovable 
plates afforded as much entertainment to little readers as the

separate figures similar to paper dolls which Belcher, and some- 
what later Charles also, used in a few of their publications. 
The “Peacock at Home,” engraved by Charles and then 
colored in aqua-tint, is one of the rare early colored picture- 
books still extant, having been first issued in eighteen hundred 
and fourteen. The coloring of the illustrations at first doubled 
the price, and seems to have been used principally for a 
series of stories belonging to what may be styled the Ethics- 
in-Play type of juvenile literature, and entitled the “His- 
tory and Adventures of Little William,” “Little Nancy,” 
etc. These tales, written after the objective manner of Miss 
Edgeworth, glossed over by rhyme, contained usually eight 
colored plates, and sold for twenty-five cents each instead of 
twelve cents, the price of the picture-book without colored 
plates. Sometimes, as in the case of “Cinderella,” we find the 
text illustrated with a number of “Elegant Figures, to dress 
and undress.” The paper doll could be placed behind the 
costumes appropriate to the various adventures, and, to pre- 
vent the loss of the heroine, the book was tied up with pink 
or blue ribbon after the manner of a portfolio. 
With engravers on wood and copper able to make more 
attractive the passion for instruction which marked the first 
quarter of the nineteenth century, the variety of toy-book 
literature naturally became greater. Indeed, without pictures 
to render somewhat entertaining the Labor-in-Play school, it 
is doubtful whether it could have attained its widespread 
popularity. 
It is, of course, possible to name but a few titles typical 
of the various kinds of instru¢tion offered as amusement. “To

present to the young Reader a Little Miscellany of Natu- 
ral History, Moral Precept, Sentiment, and Narrative,” Dr. 
Kendall wrote “Keeper’s Travels in Search of his Master,” 
“The Canary Bird,” and “The Sparrow.” “The Prize for 
Youthful Obedience” endeavored to instill a love for ani- 
mals, and to promote obedient habits. Its story runs in this 
way: 
“A kind and good father had a little lively son, named 
Francis; but, although that little boy was six years old, he had 
not yet learned to read. 
“His mama said to him, one day, ‘if Francis will learn to 
read well, he shall have a pretty little chaise.’ 
“The little boy was vastly pleased with this; he presently 
spelt five or six words and then kissed his mama. 
“¢ Mama,’ said Francis, ‘I am delighted with the thoughts 
of this chaise, but I should like to have a horse to draw it.’ 
“*Francis shall have a little dog, which will do instead 
of a horse,’ replied his mama, ‘but he must take care to give 
him some victuals, and not do him any harm.’” 
The dog was purchased, and named Chloe. “She was as 
brisk as a bee, prettily spotted, and as gentle as a lamb.” 
We are now prepared for trouble, for the lesson of the story 
is surely not hidden. Chloe was fastened to the chaise, a cat 
secured to serve as a passenger, and “Francis drove his little 
chaise along the walk.” But “when he had been long enough 
among the gooseberry trees, his mama took him in the gar- 
den and told him the names of the flowers.” We are thus led 
to suppose that Francis had never been in the garden before! 
The mother is called away. We feel sure that the trouble

anticipated is at hand. “As soon as she was gone Francis 
began whipping the dog,” and of course when the dog dashed 
forward the cat tumbled out, and “poor Chloe was terrified 
by the chaise which banged on all sides. Francis now heartily 
repented of his cruel behaviour and went into the house 
crying, and looking like a very simple boy.” 
“I see very plainly the cause of this misfortune,” said the 
father, who, however, soon forgave his repentant son. There- 
after every day Francis learned his lesson, and was rewarded 
by facts and pictures about animals, by table-talks, or by walks 
about the country. 
Knowledge offered within small compass seems to have 
been a novelty introduced in Philadelphia by Jacob Johnson, 
who had a juvenile library in High Street. 
In eighteen hundred and three he printed two tiny volumes 
entitled “A Description of Various Objects.” Bound in green 
paper covers, the two-inch square pages were printed in bold 
type. The first volume contained the illustrations of the objects 
described in the other. The charatterizations were exceed- 
ingly short, as, for example, this of the “Puppet Show:” 
“Here are several little boys and girls looking at a puppet 
show, I suppose you would like to make one of them.” 
Four years later Johnson improved upon this, when he 
printed in better type “ People of all Nations; an useful toy 
for Girl or Boy.” Of approximately the same size as the other 
volumes, it was bound with stiff sides and calf back. The 
plates, engraved on copper, represent men of various nation- 
alities in the favorite alphabetical order. A is an American. 
V isa Virginian, —an Indian in scant costume of feathers with

a long pipe, — who, the printed description says, “is generally 
dressed after the manner of the English; but this is a poor 
African, and made a slave of.” An orang-outang represents 
the letter O, and according to the author, is “a wild man 
of the woods, in the East Indies. He sleeps under trees, and 
builds himself a hut. He cannot speak, but when the natives 
make a fire in the woods he will come and warm himself.” 
Ten years later there was still some difficulty in getting 
exact descriptions of unfamiliar animals. Thus in “A Familiar 
Description of Beasts and Birds” the baboon is drawn with 
a dog’s body and an uncanny head with a snout. The reader 
is informed that “the baboon has a long face resembling a 
dog’s; his eyes are red and very bright, his teeth are large 
and strong, but his swiftness renders him hard to be taken. 
He delights in fishing, and will stay for a considerable time 
under water. He imitates several of our actions, and will 
drink wine, and eat human food.” 
Another series of three books, written by William Darton, 
the English publisher and maker of toy-books, was called 
“Chapters of Accidents, containing Caution and Instruction.” 
Thrilling accounts of “Escapes from Danger” when robbing 
birds’-nests and hunting lions and tigers were intermingled 
with wise counsel and lessons to be gained from an “ Upset 
Cart,” or a “Balloon Excursion.” With one incident the 
Philadelphia printer took the liberty of changing the title to 
“Cautions to Walkers on the Streets of Philadelphia.” High 
Street, now Market Street, is represented in a picture of the 
young woman who, unmindful of the warning, “Never to 
turn hastily around the corner of a street,” “ran against the

porter’s load and nearly lost one of her eyes.” The change, of 
course, is worthy of notice only because of the slight effort 
to locate the story in America. 
An attempt to familiarize children with flowers resulted in 
two tales, called “The Rose’s Breakfast” and “ Flora’s Gala,” 
in which flowers were personified as they took part in fétes. 
“Garden Amusements, for Improving the Minds of Little 
Children,” was issued by Samuel Wood of New York with 
this advertisement: “This little treatise, (written and first 
published in the great emporium of the British nation) con- 
taining so many pleasing remarks for the juvenile mind, was 
thought worthy of an American edition. ... Being so very 
natural, .. . and its tendency so moral and amusing, it is to 
be hoped an advantage will be obtained from its re-publica- 
tion in Freedonia.” 
Dialogue was the usual method of instruétion employed 
by Miss Edgeworth and her followers. In “Garden Amuse- 
ments” the conversation was interrupted by a note criticising 
a quotation from Milton as savoring too much of poetic 
license. Cowper also gained the anonymous critic’s disappro- 
val, although it was his point of view and not his style that 
came under censure. 
In still another series of stories often reprinted from London 
editions were those moral tales with the sub-title “Caution- 
ary Stories in Verse.” Mr. William James used these ‘‘Cau- 
tionary Verses for Children” as an example of the manner 
in which “the muse of evangelical protestantism in England, 
with the mind fixed on the ideas of danger, had at last drifted 
away from the original gospel of freedom.” “Chronic anxiety,” 
[ 175 ]

Mr. James continued, “marked the earlier part of this [nine- 
teenth] century in evangelical circles.” A little salmon-col- 
ored volume, “The Daisy,” is a good example of this series. 
Each rhyme is a warning or an admonition; a chronic fear 
that a child might be naughty. “Drest or Undrest” is typical 
of the sixteen hints for the proper conduct of every-day life 
contained in the innocent “Daisy:” 
“When children are naughty and will not be drest, 
Pray what do you think is the way? 
Why, often I really believe it is best 
To keep them in night-clothes all day! 
“But then they can have no good breakfast to eat, 
Nor walk with their mother and aunt; 
At dinner they’ll have neither pudding nor meat, 
Nor anything else that they want. 
“Then who would be naughty and sit all the day 
In night-clothes unfit to be seen! 
And pray who would lose all their pudding and play 
For not being drest neat and clean.” 
Two other sets of books with a like purpose were brought 
out by Charles about eighteen hundred and sixteen. One be- 
gan with those familiar nursery verses entitled “My Mother,” 
by Ann Taylor, which were soon followed by “ My Father,” all 
the family, “My Governess,” and even “My Pony.” The 
other set of books was “calculated to promote Benevolence 
and Virtue in Children.” “Little Fanny,” “Little Nancy,” 
and “Little Sophie” were all held up as warnings of the results 
of pride, greed, and disobedience. 
The difference between these heroines of fiction and the 
characters drawn by Maria Edgeworth lies mainly in the fact

that they spoke in rhyme instead of in prose, and that they 
were almost invariably naughty; or else the parents were cruel 
and the children suffered. Rarely do we find a cheerful tale 
such as “The Cherry Orchard” in this cautionary style of 
toy-book. Still more rarely do we find any suspicion of that 
alloy of nonsense supposed by Miss Edgeworth to make the 
sense work well. It is all quite serious. “Little Nancy, or, the 
Punishment of Greediness,” is representative of this sort of 
moral and cautionary tale. The frontispiece, “embellishing” 
the first scene, shows Nancy in receipt of an invitation to a 
garden party: 
“Now the day soon appear’d 
But she very much fear’d 
She should not be permitted to go. 
Her best frock she had torn, 
The last time it was worn; 
Which was very vexatious, you know.” 
However, the mother consents with the caution: 
“Not to greedily eat 
The nice things at the treat; 
As she much wished to break her of this.” 
Arrived at the party, Nancy shared the games, and 
“At length was seated, 
With her friends to be treated; 
So determin’d on having her share, 
That she drank and she eat 
Ev’ry thing she could get, 
Yet still she was loth to forbear.” 
The disastrous consequences attending Nancy’s disregard of 
her mother’s admonition are displayed in a full-page illus-

end in bed of the day’s pleasure. Then the moral: 
“My young readers beware, 
And avoid with great care 
Such excesses as these you ve just read; 
For be sure you will find 
It your interest to mind 
What your friends and relations have said.” 
Perhaps of all the toy imprints of the early century none 
are more curious in modern eyes than the three or four Ger- 
man translations printed by Philadelphia firms. In eighteen 
hundred and nine Johnson and Warner issued “Kleine 
Erzéhlungen uber ein Buch mit Kupfern.” This seems to 
be a translation of “A Mother’s Remarks over a Set of Cuts,” 
and contains a reference to another book entitled “ Anecdo- 
ten von Hunden.” Still another book is extant, printed in 
eighteen hundred and five by Zentler, “Unterhaltungen fir 
Deutsche Kinder.” This, according to its preface, was one 
of a series for which Jacob and Benjamin Johnson had con- 
sented to lend the plates for illustrations. 
Patriotism, rather than diversion, still characterized the 
very little original work of the first quarter of the century 
for American children. A book with the imposing title of 
“Geographical, Statistical and Political Amusement” was 
published in Philadelphia in eighteen hundred and six. “This 
work,” says its advertisement, “is designed as an easy means 
of uniting Instruction with Pleasure ...to entice the youth- 
ful mind to an acquaintance with a species of information 
[about the United States] highly useful.”

“The Juvenile Magazine, or Miscellaneous Repository of 
Useful Information,” issued in eighteen hundred and three, 
contained as its only original contribution an article upon 
General Washington’s will, “an affecting and most original 
composition,” wrote the editor. This was followed seven years 
later by the well-known “Life of George Washington,” by 
M. L. Weems, in which was printed the now famous and dis- 
puted cherry-tree incident. Its abridged form known to pres- 
ent day nursery lore differs from the long drawn out account 
by Weems, who, like Thomas Day, risked being diffuse in his 
desire to show plainly his moral. The last part of the story 
sufficiently gives his manner of writing: 
“Presently George and his hatchet made their appear- 
ance. ‘George,’ said his father, ‘do you know who killed that 
beautiful little cherry tree yonder in the garden?’ That was 
a tough question; and George staggered under it for a mo- 
ment; but quickly recovered himself, and looking at his 
father, with the sweet face of youth brightened with the in- 
expressible charm of all conquering truth, he bravely cried 
out, ‘I can’t tell a lie, Pa; you know I can’t tell a lie. I did 
cut it with my hatchet!’ ‘Run to my arms, you dearest boy,’ 
cried his father in transports, ‘run to my arms; glad am I, 
George, that you killed my tree; for you have paid me for it 
a thousand fold. Such an ac& of heroism is worth more than a 
thousand trees, though blossomed with silver, and their fruits 
of purest gold.’” 
Franklin’s “Way to Wealth” was considered to be per- 
fectly adapted to all children’s comprehension, and was is- 
sued by various publishers of juvenile books. By eighteen 
[ 179 ]
-P-A-G-E-226
  Forgotten Books of the 
hundred and eight it was illustrated and sold “with fine en- 
gravings for twenty-five cents.” 
Of patriotic poetry there was much for grown folks, but the 
“Patriotic and Amatory Songster,” advertised by S. Avery 
of Boston about the time Weems’s biography was published, 
seems a title ill-suited to the juvenile public for whom Avery 
professed to issue it. 
Among the books which may be cited as furnishing in- 
structive amusement with less of the admixture of moral 
purpose was the “London Cries for Children,” with pictures 
of street peddlers. This was imitated in America by the pub- 
lication of the “Cries of New York” and “Cries of Phila- 
delphia.” 
In the Lenox Colleétion there is now one of the various 
editions of the “Cries of New York” (published in 1808), 
which is valuable both as a record of the street life of the 
old-fashioned town of ninety-six thousand inhabitants, and 
as perhaps the first child’s book of purely local interest, with 
original woodcuts very possibly designed and engraved by 
Alexander Anderson. 
The “Cries of New York” is of course modelled after the 
“London Cries,” but the account it gives of various incidents 
in the daily life of old New York makes us grateful for the 
existence of this child’s toy. A picture of a chimney-sweep, 
for instance, is copied, with his cry of “Sweep, O, O, O, O,” 
from the London book, but the text accompanying it is 
altered to accord with the custom in New York of firing 
a gun at dawn: 
“ About break of day, after the morning gun is heard from

Governor’s Island, and so through the forenoon, the ears of 
the citizens are greeted with this uncouth sound from figures 
as unpleasant to the sight, clothed in rags and covered with 
soot—a necessary and suffering class of human beings indeed 
—spending their childhood thus. And in regard to the un- 
necessary bawling of those sooty boys; it is admérable in such 
a noisy place as this, where every needless sound should be 
hushed, that such disagreeable ones should be allowed. The 
prices for sweeping chimneys are—one story houses twelve 
cents; two stories, eighteen cents; three stories, twenty-five 
cents, and so on.” 
“Hot Corn” was also cried by children, whose business it 
was to “gather cents, by distributing corn to those who are 
disposed to regale themselves with an ear.” Baked pears are 
pictured as sold “by a little black girl, with the pears in an 
earthen dish under her arm.” At the same season of the year, 
“Here’s your fine ripe water-melons” also made itself heard 
above the street noises as a street cry of entirely American 
origin. Again there were pictured “Oyster Stands,” served by 
negroes, and these: were followed by cries of 
“Fine Clams: choice Clams, 
Here’s your Rock-a-way beach 
Clams: here’s your fine 
‘Young, sand Clams,” 
from Flushing Cove Bay, which the text explains, “turn out

of negroes and negro children into the illustrations is alto-

first distinétly American piéture-book. Indeed, with the ex- 
ception of this and an occasional illustration in some other- 
wise English reproduction, all the American publishers at 
this time seem to have modelled their wares for small children 
after those of two large London firms, J. Harris, successor to 
Newbery, and William Darton. 
To Darton, the author of “Little Truths,” the children 
were indebted for a serious attempt to improve the chara¢ter 
of toy-books. A copper-plate engraver by profession, Darton’s 
attention was drawn to the scarcity of books for children by 
the discovery that there was not much written for them that 
was worth illustrating. Like Newbery, he set about to make 
books himself, and with John Harvey, also an engraver, he 
set up in Grace Church Street an establishment for printing 
and publishing, from which he supplied, to a great extent, the 
juvenile books closely imitated by American printers. Besides 
his own compositions, he was very alert to encourage promis- 
ing authors, and through him the famous verses of Jane and 
Ann Taylor were brought into notice. “Original Poems,” and 
“Rhymes for the Nursery,” by these sisters, were to the old- 
time child what Stevenson’s “Child’s Garden of Verses” is 
to the modern nursery. Darton and Harvey paid ten pounds 
for the first series of “Original Poems,” and fifteen pounds for 
the second; while “Rhymes for the Nursery” brought to its 
authors the unusual sum of twenty pounds. The Taylors were 
the originators of that long series of verses for infants which 
“My Sister” and “My Governess” strove to surpass but never 
in any way equalled, although they apparently met with a fair 
sale in America.

Enterprising American booksellers also copied the new 
ways of advertising juvenile books. An instance of this is 
afforded by Johnson and Warner of Philadelphia, who ap- 
parently succeeded Jacob and Benjamin Johnson, and had, 
by eighteen hundred and ten, branch shops in Richmond, 
Virginia, and Lexington, Kentucky. They advertised their 
“neatly executed books of amusement” in book notes in the 
“Young Gentlemen and Ladies’ Magazine,” by means of 
digressions from the thread of their stories, and sometimes 
by inserting as frontispiece a rhyme taken from one used by 
John Harris of St. Paul’s Churchyard: 
“At JO— store in Market Street 
A sure reward good children meet. 
In coming home the other day 
I heard a little master say 
For ev’ry three-pence there he took 
He had received a little book. 
With covers neat and cuts so pretty 
There’s not its like in all the city; 
And that for three-pence he could buy 
A story book would make one cry; 
For little more a book of Riddles: 
Then let us not buy drums and fiddles 
Nor yet be stopped at pastry cooks’, 
But spend our money all in books; 
For when we’ve learnt each bit by heart 
Mamma will treat us with a tart.” 
Later, when engraving had become more general in use, 
William Charles cut for an advertisement, as frontispiece to 
some of his imprints, an interior scene containing a shelf of 
books labelled “ W. Charles’ Library for Little Folks.” About

the same time another form of advertisement came into use. 
This was the publisher’s Recommendation, which frequently ac- 
companied the narrative in place of a preface. The “Story of 
Little Henry and his Bearer,” by Mrs. Sherwood, a writer of 
many English Sunday-school tales, contained the announce- 
ment that it was “fraught with much useful instruction. It is 
recommended as an excellent thing to be put in the hands 
of children; and grown persons will find themselves well paid 
for the trouble of reading it.” 
Little Henry belonged to the Sunday-school type of hero, 
one whose biography Dr. Holmes doubtless avoided when 
possible. Yet no history of toy-books printed presumably 
for children’s amusement as well as instruction should omit 
this favorite story, which represents all others of its class of 
Religion-in-Play books. The following incidents are taken 
from an edition printed by Lincoln and Edmunds of Boston. 
This firm made a special feature of “ Books suitable for Pres- 
ents in Sunday-School.” They sold wholesale for eight dollars 
a hundred, such tales as Taylor’s “ Hymns for Infant Minds,” 
“Friendly Instruction,” Fenelon’s “ Reflections,” Doddridge’s 
“Principles of the Christian Religion,” “Pleasures of Piety 
in Youth,” “ Walks of Usefulness,” “ Practical Piety,” etc. 
The objective point of little Henry’s melancholy history 
was to prove the “Usefulness of Female Missionaries,” said 
its editor, Mrs. Cameron, a sister of the author, who at the 
time was herself living in India. Mrs. Sherwood based the 
thread of her story upon the life of a household in India, 
but it winds itself mainly around the conversion of the 
faithful Indian bearer who served five-year-old Henry. This 
[ 184 ]

small orphan was one of those morbidly religious children 
who “never said a bad word and was vexed when he heard 
any other person do it.” He also, although himself “saved 
by grace,” as the phrase then ran in evangelical circles, was 
chronically anxious lest he should offend the Lord. To quote 
verbatim from this relic of the former religious life would 
savor too much of ridiculing those things that were sacred 
and serious to the people of that day. Yet the main inci- 
dents of the story were these: Henry’s conversion took place 
after a year and a half of hard work on the part of a mission- 
ary, who finally had the satisfaction of bringing little Henry 
“from the state of grossest heathen darkness and ignorance 
to a competent knowledge of those doétrines necessary to 
salvation.” This was followed immediately by the offer of 
Henry to give all his toys for a Bible with a purple morocco 
cover. Then came the preparations for the teacher’s departure, 
when she called him to her room and catechized him in a 
manner worthy of Cotton Mather a century before. After his 
teacher’s departure the boy, mindful of the lady’s final ad- 
monition, sought to make a Christian of his bearer, Boosy. 
Like so many story-book parents, Henry’s mother was alto- 
gether neglectful of her child; and consequently he was left 
much to the care of Boosy—time which he improved with 
“arguments with Boosy concerning the great Creator of ~ 
things.” But it is not necessary to follow Henry through his 
ardent missionary efforts to the admission of the black boy of 
his sinful state, nor to the time when the hero was delivered 
from this evil world. Enough has been said to show that the 
religious child of fiction was not very different from little

  Forgotten Books of the 
Elizabeth Butcher or Hannah Hill of colonial days, whose 
pious sayings were still read when “Little Henry” was in- 
troduced to the American child. 
Indeed, when Mrs. Sherwood’s fictitious children were not 
sufficiently religious to come up to the standard of five-year- 
old Henry, their parents were invariably as pious as the father 
of the “Fairchild Family.” This was imported and reprinted 
for more than one generation as a “best seller.” It was almost 
a modernized version of Janeway’s “Token for Children,” 
with Mather’s supplement of “A Token for the Children of 
New England,” in its frequent production of death-bed scenes, 
together with painful object lessons upon the sinfulness of 
every heart. To impress such lessons Mr. Fairchild spared 
his family no sight of horror or distress. He even took 
them to see a man on the gallows, “that,” said the ingenuous 
gentleman, “they may love each other with a perfec and 
heavenly love.” As the children gazed upon the dreadful 
obje& the tender father described in detail its every phase, 
and ended by kneeling in prayer. The story of Evelyn in the 
third chapter was written as the result of a present of books 
from an American Universalist, whose doctrines Mrs. Sher- 
wood thought likely to be pernicious to children and should 
be controverted as soon as possible. Later, other things ema- 
nating from America were considered injurious to children, 
but this seems to be the first indication that American ideas 
were noticed in English juvenile literature. 
But all this lady’s tales were not so lugubrious, and many 
were immense favorites. Children were even named for the 
hero of the “Little Millenium Boy.” Publishers frequently

sent her orders for books to be “written to cuts,” and the 
“Busy Bee,” the “Errand Boy,” and the “Rose” were some of 
the results of this method of supplying the demand for her 
work. Naturally, Mrs. Sherwood, like Miss Edgeworth, had 
many imitators, but if we could believe the incidents related 
as true to life, parents would seem to have been either very 
indifferent to their children or forever suspicious of them. 
In Newbery’s time it had been thought no sin to wear fine 
buckled shoes, to be genteelly dressed with a wide “ribband;” 
but now the vain child was one who wore a white frock with 
pink sash, towards whom the finger of scorn was pointed, and 
from whom the moral was unfailingly drawn. Vanity was, 
apparently, an unpardonable sin, as when in a “ Moral Tale,” 
“Mamma observed the rising lass 
By stealth retiring to the glass 
To practise little arts unseen 
In the true genius of thirteen.” 
The constant effort to draw a lesson from every action some- 
times led to overstepping the bounds of truth by the par- 
ents themselves, as for example in a similar instance of love 
for a mirror. “ What is this I see, Harriet?” asked a mother in 
“Emulation.” “Is that the way you employ your precious 
time? I am no longer surprised at the alteration in your looks 
of late, that you have appeared so sickly, have lost your com- 
plexion; in short I have twenty times been on the point of 
asking you if you are ill. You look shockingly, child.” 
“Iam very well, Mamma, indeed,” cried Harriet, quite 
alarmed. 
“Impossible, my dear, you can never look well, while you

follow such an unwholesome prattice. Looking-glasses were 
never intended for little girls, and very few sensible people 
use them as there is something really poisonous in their com- 
position. To use them is not only prejudicial to the health 
but to the disposition.” 
Although this conception of the use of looking-glasses as 
prejudicial to right living seems to hark back to the views 
expressed in the old story of the “ Prodigal Daughter,” who sat 
before a mirror when the Devil made his second appear- 
ance, yet the world of story-book literature, even though its 
creators were sometimes either careless or ignorant of facts, 
now also emphasized the value of general knowledge, which 
it endeavored to pour in increasing quantity into the nursery, 
Miss More had started the stream of goody-goody books, 
while Miss Edgeworth, Mrs. Barbauld, and Thomas Day were 
the originators of the deluge of conversational bores, babies, 
boys, and teachers that threatened to flood the family book- 
shelves of America when the American writers for children 
came upon the scene.

American Writers and English Critics 
T is customary to refer to the early writings of Wash- 
ington Irving as works that marked the time when litera- 
ture pure and simple developed in America. Such writing 
as had hitherto attracted attention concerned itself, not with . 
matters of the imagination, but with facts and theories of 
current and momentous interest. Religion and the affairs 
of the separate commonwealths were uppermost in people’s 
minds in colonial days; political warfare and the defence of 
the policy of Congress absorbed attention in Revolutionary 
times; and later the necessity of expounding principles of 
government and of fostering a national feeling produced a 
literature of fact rather than of fancy. 
Gradually all this had changed. A new generation had 
grown up with more leisure for writing and more time to de- 
vote to the general culture of the public. The English periodi- 
cal with its purpose of “improving the taste, awakening the 
attention, and amending the heart,” had once met these re- 
quirements. Later on these periodicals had been keenly en- 
joyed, but at the same time there appeared American maga- 
zines, modelled after them, but largely filled by contributions 
from literary Americans. Early in the nineteenth century such 
publications were current in most large towns. From the 
short essays and papers in these periodicals to the tales of 
Cooper and Irving the step, after all, was not a long one. 
The children’s literature of amusement developed, after the 
E290]

  Forgotten Books of the 
end of the eighteenth century, in a somewhat similar way, 
although as usual tagging along after that of their parents. 
With the constantly increasing population the production 
of children’s books grew more profitable, and in eighteen hun- 
dred and two Benjamin Johnson made an attempt to pub- 
lish a “Juvenile Magazine” in Philadelphia. Its purpose was 
to be a “Miscellaneous Repository of Useful Information;” 
but the contents were so largely drawn from English sources 
that it was probably, like the toy-books, pirated from an 
English publisher. Indeed, one of the few extant volumes 
contains only one article of distin&tly American composition 
among essays on Education, the Chotce of a Wife, Love, papers 
on natural history, selections from poems by Coleridge and 
Cowper; and by anonymous makers of verse about Consump- 
tion and Friendship. The American contribution, a discussion 
of President Washington’s will, has already been mentioned. 
In the same year, 1802, the “Juvenile Olio” was started, 
edited by “Amyntor,” but like Johnson’s “Juvenile Maga- 
zine,” was only issued at irregular intervals and was short-lived. 
Other ventures in children’s periodicals continued to be 
made, however. The “Juvenile Magazine,” with “Religious, 
Moral, and Entertaining Pieces in Prose and Verse,” was com- 
piled by Arthur Donaldson, and sold in eighteen hundred 
and eleven as a monthly in Philadelphia—then the literary 
centre —for twelve and a half cents a number. In eighteen 
hundred and thirteen, in the same city, the “Juvenile Port- 
folio” made its appearance, possibly in imitation of Joseph 
Dennie’s “Port Folio;” but it too failed from lack of sup- 
port and interest.

Boston proved more successful in arousing attention to 
the possibilities in a well-conduéted children’s periodical, al- 
though it was not until thirteen years later that Lydia Maria 
Child established the “Juvenile Miscellany for the Instruc- 
tion and Amusement of Youth.” Three numbers were issued 
in 1826, and thereafter it appeared every other month until 
August, 1834, when it was succeeded by a magazine of the 
same name conduéted by Sarah J. Hale. 
This periodical is a landmark in the history of story-writing 
for the American child. Here at last was an opportunity for 
the editors to give to their subscribers descriptions of cities 
in their own land in place of accounts of palaces in Persia; 
biographies of national heroes instead of incidents in the life 
of Mahomet; and tales of Indians rather than histories of 
Arabians and Turks. For its pages Mrs. Sigourney, Miss Eliza 
Leslie, Mrs. Wells, Miss Sedgwick, and numerous anonymous 
contributors gladly sent stories of American scenes and inci- 
dents which were welcomed by parents as well as by children. 
In the year following the first appearance of Mrs. Hale’s” 
“Juvenile Miscellany,” the March number is typical of the 
amusement and instruction the editor endeavored to provide. 
This contained a life of Benjamin Franklin (perhaps the 
earliest child’s life of the philosopher and statesman), a tale 
of an Indian massacre of an entire settlement in Maine, an 
essay on memory, a religious episode, and extracts from a 
traveller’s journal. The traveller, quite evidently a Bostonian, 
criticised New York in a way not unfamiliar in later days, 
as a city where “the love of literature was less strong than 
in some other parts of the United States;” and then in trying

to soften the statement, she fell into a comparison with Phila- 
delphia, also made many times since the gentle critic observed 
the difference. “New York,” she wrote, “has energy, spirit, 
and bold, lofty enterprise, totally wanting in Philadelphia, 
. .. a place of neat, well regulated plans.” Also, like the Eng- 
lish story-book of the previous century, this American “Mis- 
cellany” introduced Maxims for a Student, found, it cheerfully 
explained, “among the manuscripts of a deceased friend.” 
Puzzles and conundrums made an entertaining feature, and 
as the literary chef d’euvre was inserted a poem supposed to 
be composed by a babe in South Carolina, but of which the 
author was undoubtedly Mrs. Gilman, whose ideas of a baby’s 
ability were certainly not drawn from her own nursery. 
A rival to the “Juvenile Miscellany” was the “Youth’s 
Companion,” established at this time in Boston by Nathaniel 
P. Willis and the Reverend Asa Rand. The various religious 
societies also began to issue children’s magazines for Sunday 
perusal: the Massachusetts Sunday School Union beginning 
in 1828 the “Sabbath School Times,” and other societies soon 
following its example. 
“ Parley’s Magazine,” planned by Samuel G. Goodrich and 
published by Lilly, Wait and Company of Boston, ran a suc- 
cessful course of nine years from eighteen hundred and thirty- 
three. The prospectus declared the intention of its conductors 
“to give descriptions of manners, customs, and countries, 
Travels, Voyages, and Adventures in Various parts of the 
world, interesting historical notes, Biography, particularly of 
young persons, original tales, cheerful and pleasing Rhymes, 
and to issue the magazine every fortnight.” The popularity of

the name of Peter Parley insured a goodly number of sub- 
scriptions from the beginning, and the life of “ Parley’s Mag- 
azine” was somewhat longer than any of its predecessors. 
In the south the idea of issuing a juvenile magazine was 
taken up by a firm in Charleston, and the “Rose Bud” was 
started in eighteen hundred and thirty. The “Rose Bud,” a 
weekly, was largely the result of the success of the “Juvenile 
Miscellany,” as the editor of the southern paper, Mrs. Gilman, 
was a valued contributor to the “ Miscellany,” and had been 
encouraged in her plan of a paper for children of the south 
by the Boston conduétors of the northern periodical. 
Mrs. Gilman was born in Boston, and at sixteen years 
of age had published a poem most favorably criticised at 
the time. Marrying a clergyman who settled in Charleston, 
she continued her literary work, but was best known to our 
grandmothers as the author of “ Recollections of a New Eng- 
land Housekeeper.” The “Rose Bud” soon blossomed into 
the “Southern Rose,” a family paper, but faded away in 1839. 
Among other juvenile weeklies of the time may be men- 
tioned the “Juvenile Rambler” and the “Hive,” which are 
chiefly interesting by reason of the opportunity their columns 
offered to youthful contributors. 
Another series of “miscellaneous repositories” for the in- 
structive enjoyment of little people was furnished by the 
Annuals of the period. These, of course, were modelled after 
the adult Annuals revolving in social circles and adorning the 
marble-topped tables of drawing-rooms in both England and 
America. 
Issued at the Christmas and New Year seasons, these chil- 
[ 195 ]

  Forgotten Books of the 
dren’s Annuals formed the conventional gift-book for many 
years, and publishers spared no effort to make them attrac- 
tive. Indeed, their red morocco, silk, or embossed scarlet 
cloth bindings form a cheerful contrast to the dreary array 
of black and drab cloth covering the fiction of both old and 
young. Better illustrations were also introduced than the ugly 
cuts “adorning” the other books for juvenile readers. Oliver 
Pelton, Joseph Andrews (who ranked well as an engraver), 
Elisha Gallaudet, Joseph G. Kellogg, Joseph I. Pease, and 
Thomas Illman were among the workers in line-engraving 
whose early work served to illustrate, often delightfully, 
these popular collections of children’s stories. 
Among the “Annualettes,” “Keepsakes,” “Evening Hours,” 
and “Infant’s Hours” published at intervals after eighteen hun- 
dred and twenty-five the “Token” stands preeminent. Edited 
by Samuel G. Goodrich (Peter Parley) between the years 
eighteen hundred and twenty-eight and eighteen hundred and 
forty-two, its contents and illustrations were almost entirely 
American. Edward Everett, Bishop Doane, A. H. Everett, 
John Quincy Adams, Longfellow, Hawthorne, Miss Sedg- 
wick, Eliza Leslie, Dr. Holmes, Horace Greeley, James T. 
Fields, and Gulian Verplanck—all were called upon to make 
the “Token” an annual treat to children. Of the many stories 
written for it, only Hawthorne’s “Twice Told Tales” sur- 
vive; but the long list of contributors of mark in American 
literature cannot be surpassed to-day by any child’s book by 
contemporary authors. The contents, although written in the 
style of eighty years ago, are undoubtedly good from a lit- 
erary standpoint, however out of date their story-telling quali-

ties may be. And, moreover, the “ Token” assuredly gave plea- 
sure to the public for which its yearly publication was made. 
By eighteen hundred and thirty-five the “Annual” was in 
full swing as a popular publication. Then an international 
book was issued, “The American Juvenile Keepsake,” edited 
by Mrs. Hofland, the well-known writer of English stories 
for children. Mrs. Hofland cried up her wares in a manner 
quite different from that of the earlier literary ladies. “My 
table of contents,” she wrote in her introduction, “exhibits a 
list of names not exceeded in reputation by any preceding 
Juvenile Annual; for, although got up with a celerity almost 
distressing in the hurry it imposed, such has been the kind- 
ness of my literary friends, that they have left me little more 
to wish for.” Among the English contributors were Miss Mit- 
ford, Miss Jean Roberts, Miss Browne, and Mrs. Hall, the 
ablest writers for English children, and already familiar to 
American households. 
Mrs. Hofland, herself, wrote one of its stories, noteworthy 
as an early attempt of an English author to write for an Ameri- 
can juvenile public. She found her theme in the movement 
of emigration strong in England just then among the laboring 
people. No amount of discouragement and bitter criticism 
of the United States by the British press was sufficient to 
stem appreciably the tide of laborers that flowed towards the 
country whence came information of better wages and more 
work. Mrs. Hofland, although writing for little Americans, 
could not wholly resist the customary fling at American life 
and society. She acknowledged, however, that long residence 
altered first impressions and brought out the kernel of Ameri- 
[ 197 ]
-P-A-G-E-248
  Forgotten Books of the 
can character, whose husk only was visible to sojourners. She 
deplored the fa& that “gay English girls used only to the 
polished society of London were likely to return with the im- 
pression that the men were rude and women frivolous.” This 
impression the author was inclined to believe unjust, yet 
deemed it wise, because of the incredulous (perhaps even 
in America!), to back her own opinion by a note saying that 
this view was also shared by a valued friend who had lived 
fourteen years in Raleigh, South Carolina. 
Having thus done justice, in her own eyes, to conditions in 
the new country, Mrs. Hofland, launched the laborer’s family 
upon the sea, and followed their travels from New York to 
Lexington, Kentucky, at that time a land unknown to the 
average American child beyond some hazy association with 
the name of Daniel Boone. It was thus comparatively safe 
ground on which to place the struggles of the immigrants, 
who prospered because of their English thrift and were an 
example to the former residents. Of course the son grew up to 
prove a blessing to the community, and eventually, like the 
heroes in old Isaiah Thomas’s adaptations of Newbery’s good 
boys, was chosen Congressman. 
There is another point of interest in connection with this 
English author’s tale. Whether consciously or not, it isa very 
good imitation of Peter Parley’s method of travelling with 
his charaéters in various lands or over new country. It is, per- 
haps, the first instance in the history of children’s literature 
of an American story-writer influencing the English writer 
of juvenile fiction. And it was not the only time. So popular 
and profitable did Goodrich’s style of story become that some-

what later the frequent attempts to exploit anonymously and 
profitably his pseudonymn in England as well as in America 
were loudly lamented by the originator of the “ Tales of Peter 
Parley.” It is, moreover, suggestive of the gradual change in 
the relations between the two countries that anything written 
in America was thought worth imitating. America, indeed, 
was beginning to supply incidents around which to weave 
stories for British children and tales altogether made at home 
for her own little readers. 
In the same volume Mrs. S. C. Hall also boldly attempted 
to place her heroine in American surroundings. Philadelphia 
was the scene chosen for her tale; but, having flattered her 
readers by this concession to their sympathies and interest, 
the author was still sufficiently insular to doubt the existence 
of a competent local physician in this the earliest medical 
centre in the United States. An English family had come to 
make their home in the city, where the mother’s illness ne- 
cessitated the attendance of a French doétor to make a cor- 
rect diagnosis of her case. An operation was advised, which 
the mother, Mrs. Allen, hesitated to undergo in an unknown 
land. Emily, the fourteen-year-old daughter, urged her not 
to delay, as she felt quite competent to be in attendance, 
having had “five teeth drawn without screaming; nursed a 
brother through the whooping-cough and a sister through the 
measles.” 
“Ma foi, Mademoiselle,” said the French dottor, “you are 
very heroic; why, let me see, you talk of being present at an 
operation, which I would not hardly suffer my junior pupils to 
attend.”

“Put,” said the heroic damsel, “my resolution, sir, to any 
test you please; draw one, two, three teeth, I will not flinch.” 
And this courage the writer thought could not be surpassed 
in a London child. It is needless to say that Emily’s fortitude 
was sufficient to endure the sight of her mother’s suffering, 
and to nurse her to complete recovery. Evidently residence 
in America had not yet sapped the young girl’s moral strength, 
or reduced her to the frivolous creature an American woman 
was reputed in England to be. 
Among the home contributors to “The American Juvenile 
Keepsake” were William L. Stone, who wrote a prosy arti- 
cle about animals; and Mrs. Embury, called the Mitford of 
America (because of her stories of village life), who furnished 
a religious tale to controvert the infidel doctrines considered 
at the time subtly undermining to childish faith, with prob- 
able reference to the Unitarian movement then gaining many 
adherents. Mrs. Embury’s stories were so generally gloomy, 
being strongly tinged with the melancholy religious views of 
certain church denominations, that one would suppose them 
to have been eminently successful in turning children away 
from the faith she sought to encourage. For this “Keepsake” 
the same lady let her poetical fancy take flight in “The Re- 
membrance of Youth is a Sigh,” a somewhat lugubrious and 
pessimistic subject for a child’s Christmas Annual. Occasion- 
ally a more cheerful mood possessed “Ianthe,” as she chose 
to call herself, and then we have some of the earliest descrip- 
tions of country life in literature for American children. There 
is one especially charming picture of a walk in New England

hunt for chestnuts among the dry brown leaves, and the squir-

Dr. Holmes has somewhere remarked upon the total lack of 
American nature descriptions in the literature of his boyhood. 
No birds familiar to him were ever mentioned; nor were 
the flowers such as a New England child could ever gather. 
Only English larks and linnets, cowslips and hawthorn, were 
to be found in the toy-books and little histories read to him. 
“Everything was British: even the robin, a domestic bird,” 
wrote the doctor, “instead of a great fidgety, jerky, whooping 
thrush.” But when Peter Parley, Jacob Abbott, Lydia Maria 
Child, Mrs. Embury, and Eliza Leslie began to write short 
stories, the Annuals and periodicals abounded in American 
scenes and local color. 
There was also another great incentive for writers to work 
for children. This was the demand made for stories from the 
American Sunday School Union, whose influence upon the 
charaéter of juvenile literature was a force bearing upon 
the various writers, and whose growth was coincident with 
the development of the children’s periodical literature. 
The American Sunday School Union, an outgrowth of the 
several religious publication societies, in eighteen hundred 
and twenty-four began to do more extensive work, and there- 
fore formed a committee to judge and pronounce upon all 
manuscripts, which American writers were asked to submit. 
The sessions of the Sunday-schools were no longer held for 
illiterate children only. The younger members of each parish 
or church were found upon its benches each Sunday morning 
or afternoon. To promote and to impress the religious teach-

ing in these schools, rewards were offered tor well-prepared 
lessons and regular attendance. Also the scholars were en- 
couraged to use the Sunday-school library. For these different 
purposes many books were needed, but naturally only those 
stamped with the approval of the clergyman in charge were 
circulated. 
The board of publication appointed by the American 
Sunday School Union—composed chiefly of clergymen of 
certain denominations— passed upon the merits of the many 
manuscripts sent in by piously inclined persons, and edited 
such of them as proved acceptable. The marginal notes on the 
pages of the first edition of an old Sunday-school favorite bear 
witness to the painstaking care of the editors that the leaflets, 
traéts, and stories poured in from all parts of the country 
should “shine by reason of the truth contained,” and “avoid 
the least appearance, the most indirect insinuations, of any- 
thing which can militate against the strictest ideas of pro- 
priety.” The tales had also to keep absolutely within the 
bounds of religion. Many were the stories found lacking in 
dire& religious teaching, or returned because religion was 
not vitally connected with the plot, to be rewritten or sent 
elsewhere for publication. 
The hundreds of stories turned out in what soon became 
a mechanical fashion were of two patterns: the one of the 
good child, a constant attendant upon Sabbath School and 
Divine Worship, but who died young after converting par- 
ent or worldly friend during a painful illness; the other of 
the unregenerate youth, who turned away from the godly 
admonition of mother and clergyman, refused to attend Sun-

day-school, and consequently fell into evil ways leading to 
the thief’s or drunkard’s grave. Often a sick mother was 
introduced to claim emotional attention, or to use as a lay 
figure upon which to drape Scripture texts as fearful warnings 
to the black sheep of the family. Indeed, the little reader no 
sooner began to enjoy the tale of some sweet and gentle girl, 
or to delight in the mischievous boy, than he was called upon 
to reflect that early piety portended an early death, and 
youthful pranks led to a miserable old age. Neither prospect 
offered much encouragement to hope for a happy life, and 
from conversations with those brought up on this form of 
religious culture, it is certain that if a child escaped without 
becoming morbid and neurotic, there were dark and secret 
resolves to risk the unpleasant future in favor of a happy 
present. 
The stories, too, presented a somewhat paradoxical famil- 
iarity with the ways of a mysterious Providence. This was 
exceedingly perplexing to the thoughtful child, whose que- 
ries as to justice were too often hushed by parent or teacher. 
In real life, every child expected, even if he did not receive, 
a tangible reward for doing the right thing; but Providence, 
according to these authors, immediately caused a good child 
to become ill unto death. It is not a matter for surprise that 
the healthy-minded, vigorous child often turned in disgust 
from the Sunday-school library to search for Cooper's tales 
of adventure on his father’s book-shelves. 
The corre&t and approved child’s story, even if not issued 
under religious auspices, was thoroughly saturated with reli- 
gion. Whatever may have been the practice of parents in

regard to their own reading, they wished that of the nursery 
to show not only an educational and moral, but a religious 
tendency. The books for American children therefore divided 
themselves into three classes: the denominational story, to set 
forth the doétrines of one church; the educational tale; and 
the moral narrative of American life. 
The denominational stories produced by the several Sun- 
day-school societies were, as has been said, only a kind of 
scaffolding upon which to build the teachings of the various 
churches. But their sale was enormous, and a factor to be 
reckoned with because of their influence upon the educa- 
tional and moral tales of their period. By eighteen hundred 
and twenty-seven, fifty-thousand books and traéts had been 
sent out by one Sunday-school society alone.* There are few 
things more remarkable in the history of juvenile literature 
than the growth of the business of the American Sunday School 
Union. By eighteen hundred and twenty-eight it had issued 
over seven hundred of these religious trifles, varying from a 
sixteen-page duodecimo to a small octavo volume; and most 
of these appear to have been written by Americans trying 
their inexperienced pens upon a form of literature not then 
recognized as difficult. The influence of such a flood of tiny 
books could hardly have been other than morbid, although 
occasionally there floated down the stream duodecimos which 
were grasped by little readers with eagerness. Such volumes, 
one reader of bygone Sunday-school books tells us, glimmered 
from the dark depths of death and prison scenes, and were 
passed along with whispered recommendation until their well-

worn covers attracted the eye of the teacher, and were quickly 
found to be missing from library shelves. Others were com- 
~ mended in their stead, such as described the city boy showing 
the country cousin the town sights, with most edifying con- 
versation as to their history; or, again, amusement of a light 
and alluring character was presumably to be found in the 
story of a little maid who sat upon a footstool at her mother’s 
knee, and while she hemmed the four sides of a handkerchief, 
listened to the account of missionary enterprises in the dark 
corners of the earth. 
To us of to-day the small illustrations are perhaps the most 
interesting feature, preserving as they do children’s occupa- 
tions and costumes. In one book we see quaintly frocked and 
pantaletted girls and much buttoned boys in Sunday-school. 
Inanother, entitled “Election Day,” are pictured two little lads 
watching, from the square in front of Independence Hall, the 
handing in of votes for the President through a window of 
the famous building— a picture that emphasizes the change 
in methods of casting the ballot since eighteen hundred and 
twenty-eight. 
That engravers were not always successful when called 
upon toembellish the pages of the Sunday-school books, many 
of them easily prove. That the designers of woodcuts were 
sometimes lacking in imagination when obliged to depict 
Bible verses can have no better example than the favorite 
vignette on title-pages portraying “My soul doth magnify the 
Lord” as a man with a magnifying glass held over a blank 
space. Perhaps equal in lack of imagination was the often 
repeated frontispiece of “Mercy streaming from the Cross,”

illustrated by a large cross with an effulgent rain beating

many pictures but little art in the old-fashioned Sunday- 
school library books. 
It was in Philadelphia that one of the first, if not the first 
children’s library was incorporated in 1827s the Apprentices’ 
Library. Eleven years later this library contained more than 
two thousand books, and had seven hundred children as 
patrons. The catalogue of that year is indicative of the pre- 
valence of the Sunday-school book. “Adventures of Lot” 
precedes the “Affectionate Daughter-in-Law,” which is fol- 
lowed by “Anecdotes of Christian Missions” and “An Alarm 
to Unconverted Sinners.” Turning the yellowed pages, we 
find “Hannah Swanton, the Casco Captive,” histories of Bible 
worthies, the “Infidel Class,” “Little Deceiver Reclaimed,” 
“Letters to Little Children,” “Juvenile Piety,” and “Julianna 
Oakley.” The bookish child of this decade could not escape 
from the “Reformed Family” and the consumptive little 
Christian, except by taking refuge in the parents’ novels, 
collections of the British poets and essayists, and the con- 
stantly increasing American writings for adults. Perhaps in 
this way the Sunday-school books may be counted among that 
long list of such things as are commonly called blessings in 
disguise.

sons, Morgan and Sons, and Thomas T. Ashe of Philadel- 
phia—to mention but a few of the publishers of juvenile 
novelties—are convincing proof that booksellers catered to 
the demand for stories with a strong religious bias. The “New 
York Weekly,” indeed, called attention to Day’s books as 
“maintaining an unbroken tendency to virtue and piety.” 
When not impossibly pious, these children of anonymous 
fiction were either insufferable prigs with a steel moral code, 
or so ill-bred as to be equally impossible and unnatural. The 
favorite plan of their creators was to follow Miss Edgeworth’s 
device of contrasting the good and naughty infant. The chil- 
dren, too, were often cousins: one, for example, was the son 
of a gentleman who in his choice of a wife was influenced by 
strié religious principles; the other boy inherited his dispo- 
sition from his mother, a lady of bland manners and fine ex- 
ternal appearance, but who failed to establish in her offspring 
“correct principles of virtue, religion, and morality.” The 
author paused at this point in the narrative to discuss the 
frailties of the lady, before resuming its slender thread. Who 
to-day could wade through with children the good-goody 
books of that generation? 
Happily, many of the writers for little ones chose to be 
unknown, for it would be ungenerous to disparage by name 
these ladies who considered their productions edifying, and 
in their ingenuousness never dreamed that their stories were 
devoid of every quality that makes a child’s book of value 
to the child. They were literally unconscious that their tales 
lacked that simplicity and direétness in style, and they them- 
selves that knowledge of human nature, absolutely necessary

to construct a pleasing and profitable story. The watchwords 
of these painstaking ladies were “religion, virtue, and moral- 
ity,” and heedless of everything else, they found oblivion in 
most cases before they gained recognition from the public 
they longed to influence. 
The decade following eighteen hundred and thirty brought 
prominently to the foreground six American authors among 
the many who occasioned brief notice. Of these writers two 
were men and four were women. Jacob Abbott and Samuel 
G. Goodrich wrote the educational tales, Abbott largely for 
the nursery, while Goodrich devoted his attention mainly 
to books for the little lads at school. The four women, Mrs. 
Sarah J. Hale, Miss Eliza Leslie, Miss Catharine Sedgwick, 
and Mrs. Lydia H. Sigourney, wrote mainly for girls, and 
took American life as their subject. Mrs. Hale wrote much 
for adults, but when editor of the “Juvenile Miscellany,” she 
made various contributions to it. Yet to-day we know her 
only by one of her “ Poems for Children,” published in Boston 
in eighteen hundred and thirty—“ Mary had a Little Lamb.” 
Mary’s lamb has travelled much farther than to school, and 
has even reached that point when its authorship has been 
disputed. Quite recently in the “Century Magazine” Mrs. 
Hale’s claim to its composition has been set forth at some 
length by Mr. Richard W. Hale, who shows clearly her de- 
sire when more than ninety years of age to be recognized 
as the originator of these verses, In faét, “shortly before her 
death,” wrote Mr. Hale, “she directed her son to write em- 
phatically that every poem in her book of eighteen hundred 
and thirty was of her own composition.” Although rarely

seen in print, “Mary had a Little Lamb” has outlived all other 
nursery rhymes of its day; perhaps because it had most truly 
the quality, unusual at the time, of being told directly and 
simply —a quality, indeed, that appeals to every generation. 
Miss Leslie, like Mrs. Hale, did much editing, beginning 
on adult gift-books and collections of housewife’s receipts, 
and then giving most of her attention to juvenile literature. 
As editor Miss Leslie did good work on the “Violet” and 
the “Pearl,” both gift-books for children. She also abridged, 
edited, and rewrote “The Wonderful Traveller,” and the 
adventures of Munchausen, Gulliver, and Sindbad, heroes 
often disregarded by this period of lack of imagination and 
over-supply of educational theories. Also, as a writer of sto- 
ries for little girls and school-maidens, Eliza Leslie met with 
warm approval on both sides of the Atlantic. 
Undoubtedly the success of Eliza Leslie’s “ American Girls’ 
Book,” modelled after the English “Boy’s Own Book,” and 
published in 1831, added to the popularity attained by her 
earlier work, although of this she was but the compiler. 
The “American Girls’ Book ” was intended for little girls, 
and by dialogue, the prevailing mode of conveying instruc- 
tion oramusement, numerous games and plays were described. 
Already many of the pastimes have gone out of fashion. “Lady 
Queen Anne” and “Robin’s Alive,” “a dangerous game with 
a lighted stick,” are altogether unknown; “Track the Rabbit” 
has changed its name to “ Fox and Geese;” “ Hot Buttered 
Beans” has found a substitute in “Hunt the Thimble;” and 
“Stir the Mush” has given place to “Going to Jerusalem.” 
But Miss Leslie did more than preserve for us these old-

fashioned games. She has left sketches of children’s ways and 
nature in her various stories for little people. She shared, of 
course, in the habit of moralizing chara¢teristic of her day, 
but her children are childish, and her heroines are full of the 
whims, and have truly the pleasures and natural emotions, 
of real children. 
Miss Leslie began her work for children in eighteen hundred 
and twenty-seven, when “Atlantic Stories” were published, 
and as her sketches of child-life appeared one after another, 
her pen grew more sure in its delineation of characters and her 
talent was speedily recognized. Even now “ Birthday Stories” 
are worth reading and treasuring because of the pictures 
of family life eighty years ago. The “Souvenir,” for exam- 
ple, is a Christmas tale of old Philadelphia; the “Cadet’s 
Sister” sketches life at West Point, where the author’s brother 
had been a student; while the “Launch of the Frigate” and 
“ Anthony and Clara” tell of customs and amusements quite 
passed away. The charming description of children shopping 
for their simple Christmas gifts, the narrative of the boys who 
paid a poor lad in a bookstore to ornament their “writing- 
pieces” for more “respectable presents” to parents, the quiet 
celebration of the day itself, can ill be spared from the his- 
tory of child life and diversions in America. It is well to be 
reminded, in these days of complex and expensive amuse- 
ments, of some of the saner and simpler pleasures enjoyed 
by children in Miss Leslie’s lifetime. 
All of this writer’s books, moreover, have some real inter- 
est, whether it be “Althea Vernon,” with the description of 
summer life and fashions at Far Rockaway (New Y ork’s Man-

hattan Beach of 1830), or “Henrietta Harrison,” with its sar- 
castic reference to the fashionable school where the pupils 
could sing French songs and Italian operas, but could not be 
sure of the notes of “ Hail Columbia.” Or again, the account 
is worth reading of the heroine’s trip to New York from Phila- 
delphia. “Simply habited in a plaid silk frock and Thibet 
shawl,” little Henrietta starts, under her uncle’s protection, at 
five o’clock in the morning to take the boat for Bordentown, 
New Jersey. There she has her first experience of a railway 
train, and looks out of the window “at all the velocity of the 
train will allow her to see.” At Heightstown small children 
meet the train with fruit and cakes to sell to hungry travel- 
lers. And finally comes the wonderful voyage from Amboy to 
the Battery in New York, which is not reached until night 
has fallen. 
This is the simple explanation as to why Eliza Leslie’s 
books met with so generous a reception: they were full of the 
incidents which children love, and unusually free from the 
affectations of the pious fictitious heroine. 
The stories of Miss Catharine Sedgwick also received most 
favorable criticism, and in point of style were certainly better 
than Miss Leslie’s. Her reputation as a literary woman was 
more than national, and “Redwood,” one of her best novels, 
was attributed in France to Fenimore Cooper, when it ap- 
peared anonymously in eighteen hundred and twenty-four. 
Miss Sedgwick’s novels, however, pass out of nursery com- 
prehension in the first chapters, although these were full of a 
healthy New England atmosphere, with coasting parties and 
picnics, Indians and gypsies, nowhere else better described. 
[ 211 ]

The same tone pervades her contributions to the “Juvenile 
Miscellany,” the “Token,” and the “ Youth’s Keepsake,” to- 
gether with her best-known children’s books, “Stories for 
Children,” “A Well Spent Hour,” and “A Love Token for 
Children.” 
In contrast to Mrs. Sherwood’s still popular “Fairchild 
Family,” Catharine Sedgwick’s stories breathe a sunny, in- 
vigorating atmosphere, abounding in local incidents, and 
vigorous in delineation of types then plentiful in New Eng- 
land. “She has fallen,” wrote one admirer, most truthfully, in 
the “North American Review” of 1827,—‘“she has fallen 
upon the view, from which the treasures of our future liter- 
ature are to be wrought. A literature to have real freshness 
must be moulded by the influences of the society where it 
had its origin. Letters thrive, when they are at home in the 
soil. Miss Sedgwick’s imaginations have such vigor and bloom 
because they are not exotics.” Another reviewer, aroused by 
English criticism of the social life in America, and full of 
the much vaunted theory that “all men are equal,” rejoiced 
in the author’s attitude towards the so-called “help” in New 
England families in contrast to Miss More’s portrayal of the 
English child’s condescension towards inferiors, which he 
thought unsuitable to set before the children in America. 
All Miss Sedgwick’s stories were the product of her own 
keen intelligence and observation, and not written in imita- 
tion of Miss More, Miss Edgeworth, or Mrs. Sherwood, as 
were the anonymous tales of “Little Lucy; or, the Pleasant 
Day,” or “ Little Helen; a Day in the Life of a Naughty Girl.” 
They preached, indeed, at length, but the preaching could

be skipped by interested readers, and unlike the work of many 
contemporaries, there was always a thread to take up. 
Mrs. Lydia H. Sigourney, another favorite contributor to 
magazines, collected her “ Poetry for Children” into a volume 
bearing this title, in eighteen hundred and thirty-four, and 
published “Tales and Essays” in the same year. These were 
followed two years later by “Olive Buds,” and thereafter 
at intervals she brought out several other books, none of 
which have now any interest except as examples of juvenile 
literature that had once a decided vogue and could safely 
be bought for the Sunday-school library. 
The names of Mrs. Anna M. Wells, Mrs. Frances S. Os- 
good, Mrs. Farrar, Mrs. Eliza L. Follen, and Mrs. Seba 
Smith were all well beloved by children eighty years ago, 
and their writings, if long since lost sight of, at least added 
their quota to the children’s publications which were dis- 
tinétly American. 
If the quantity of books sold is any indication of the popu- 
larity of an author’s work, nothing produced by any of these 
ladies is to be compared with the “Tales of Peter Parley” 
and the “Rollo Books” of Jacob Abbott. 
The tendency to instruct while endeavoring to entertain 
was remodelled by these men, who in after years had a host 
of imitators. Great visions of good to children had overtaken 
dreams of making children good, with the result that Wil- 
liam Darton’s conversational method of instruétion was com- 
pounded with Miss Edgeworth’s educational theories and 
elaborated after the manner of Hannah More. Samuel Good- 
rich, at least, confessed that his many tales were the dire&

result of a conversation with Miss More, whom, because of 
his admiration for her books, he made an effort to meet when 
in England in eighteen hundred and twenty-three. While talk- 
ing with the old lady about her “Shepherd of Salisbury Plain,” 
the idea came to Mr. Goodrich that he, himself, might write 
for American children and make good use of her method of 
introducing much detail in description. As a child he had not 
found the few toy-books within his reach either amusing 
or interesting, with the exception of this Englishwoman’s 
writings. He resolved that the growing generation should 
be better served, but little dreamed of the unprecedented suc- 
cess, as far as popularity was concerned, that the result of his 
determination would prove. 
After his return to America, the immediate favorable re- 
ception of the “Token,” under Goodrich’s direction, led to 
the publication in the same year (1828) of “Peter Parley’s 
Tales about America,” followed by “Tales about Europe.” 
At this date of retrospection the first volume seems in many 
ways the best of any of the numerous books by the same 
author. The boy hero, taken as a child companion upon a 
journey through several states, met with adventures among 
Indians upon the frontiers, and saw places of historical sig- 
nificance. Every incident is told in imitation of Miss More, 
with that detailed description which Goodrich had found 
so fascinating. If a little overdone in this respect, the narra- 
tive has certainly a freshness sadly deficient in many later 
volumes. Even the second tale seems to lack the engaging 
spontaneity of the first, and already to grow didactic and re- 
citative rather than personal. But both met with an equally

generous and appreciative reception. Parley’s educational 
tales were undoubtedly the American pioneers in what may 
be readily styled the “travelogue ” manner used in later years 
by Elbridge Brooks and many other writers for little people. 
These early attempts of Parley’s to educate the young reader 
were followed by one hundred others, which sold like hot 
cakes. Of some tales the sales reached a total of fifty thousand 
in one year, while it is estimated that seven million of Peter 
Parley’s “Histories” and “Tales” were sold before the admi- 
ration of their style and qualities waned. 
Peter Parley took his heroes farafield. Jacob Abbott adopted 
another plan of instruétion in the majority of his books. Be- 
ginning in eighteen hundred and thirty-four with the “ Young 
Christian Series,” the Reverend Mr. Abbott soon had readers 
in England, Scotland, Germany, France, Holland, and India, 
where many of his volumes were translated and republished. 
In the “Rollo Books” and “Franconia” an attempt was made 
to answer many of the questions that children of each century 
pour out toastonish and confound their elders. The child reader 
saw nothing incongruous in the remarkable wisdom and ma- 
turity of Mary Bell and Beechnut, who could give advice and 
information with equal glibness. The advice, moreover, was 
often worth following, and the knowledge occasionally worth 
having; and the little one swallowed chunks of morals and 
morsels of learning without realizing that he was doing so. 
Most of both was speedily forgotten, but many adults in after 
years were unconsciously indebted to Goodrich and Abbott 
for some familiarity with foreign countries, some interest in 
natural science.

Notwithstanding theimmense demand for Americanstories, 
there was fortunately still some doubt as to whether this re- 
modelled form of instructive amusement and moral story- 
book literature did not lack certain wholesome features char- 
acteristic of the days when fairies and folklore, and Newbery’s 
gilt volumes, had plenty of room on the nursery table. “I can- 
not very well tell,” wrote the editor of the “Fairy Book”* 
in 1836,—“I cannot very well tell why it is that the good 
old histories and tales, which used to be given to young 
people for their amusement and instruction, as soon as they 
could read, have of late years gone quite out of fashion in this 
country. In former days there was a worthy English bookseller, 
one Mr. Newbery, who used to print thousands of nice little 
volumes of such stories, which, as he solemnly declared in 
print in the books themselves, he gave away to all little boys 
and girls, charging them only a sixpenny for the gold covers. 
These of course no one could be so unreasonable as to wish 
him to furnish at his own expense. ... Yet in the last gen- 
eration, American boys and girls (the fathers and mothers, 
grandfathers and grandmothers of the present generation) 
were not wholly dependent upon Mr. Newbery of St. Paul’s 
church-yard, though they knew him well and loved him much.

the rudiments of that art by which they afterwards became

and unadulterated New Yorker, Evert Duyckinck, besides 
others in Boston and Philadelphia, who trod in the steps of 
Newbery, and supplied the infant mind with its first and 
sweetest literary food. The munificent Newbery, and the pious 
and loyal Hugh Gaine, and the patriotic Samuel Loudon are 
departed. Banks now abound and brokers swarm where Lou- 
don erst printed, and many millions worth of silk and woolen 
goods are every year sold where Gaine vended his big Bibles 
and his little story-books. They are all gone; the glittering 
covers and their more brilliant contents, the tales of wonder 
and enchantment, the father’s best reward for merit, the good 
grandmother’s most prized presents. They are gone—the 
cheap delight of childhood, the unbought grace of boyhood, 
the dearest, freshest, and most unfading recollections of ma- 
turer life. They are gone—and in their stead has succeeded 
a swarm of geological catechisms, entomological primers, and 
tales of political economy —dismal trash, all of them; some-

The origin of Mother Goose as the protecting genius of 
the various familiar jingles has been an interesting field of

vertisement. But Boston undoubtedly did once again make 
popular, at least in America, the lullabies and rhymes re- 
peated for centuries around French or English firesides. 
The history of Mother Goose and her brood is a long one. 
“Mother Goose,” writes Mr. Walter T. Field, “began her 
existence as the raconteuse of fairy tales, not as the nursery 
poetess. As La Mére Oye she told stories to French children 
more than two hundred and fifty years ago.” According to the 
researches made by Mr. Field in the literature of Mother 
Goose, “the earliest date at which Mother Goose appears as 
the author of children’s stories is 1667, when Charles Perrault, 
a distinguished French littérateur, published in Paris a little 
book of tales which he had during that and the preceding 
year contributed to a magazine known as ‘ Moejen’s Recueil,’ 
[ 218 ]

printed at The Hague. This book is entitled ‘Histoires ou 
Contes du Tems Passé, avec des Moralitez,’ and has a fron- 
tispiece in which an old woman is pictured, telling stories to 
a family group by the fireside while in the background are the 
words in large characters, ‘Contes de ma Mére l’Oye.’” 
It seems, however, to have been John Newbery’s publish- 
ing-house that made Mother Goose sponsor for the ditties in 
much the form in which we now have them. In Newbery’s 
collection of “Melodies” there were numerous footnotes 
burlesquing Dr. Johnson and his dictionary, together with 
jests upon the moralizing habit prevalent among authors. 
There is evidence that Goldsmith wrote many of these notes 
when doing hack-work for the famous publisher in St. Paul’s 
Churchyard. It is known, for instance, that in January, 
1760, Goldsmith celebrated the production of his “Good 
Natur’d Man” by dining his friends at an inn. During the 
feast he sang his favorite song, said to be 
“There was an old woman tos’t up in a blanket, 
Seventy times as high as the moon.” 
This was introduced quite irrelevantly in the preface to 
“Mother Goose’s Melodies,” but with the apology that it 
was a favorite with the editor. There is also the often quoted 
temark of Miss Hawkins as confirming Goldsmith’s editor- 
ship: “I little thought what I should have to boast, when 
Goldsmith taught me to play Jack and Jill, by two bits of 
paper on his fingers.” But neither of these statements seems 
to have more weight in solving the mystery of the editor’s 
name than the evidence of the whimsically satirical notes 
themselves. How like the author of the “ Vicar of Wakefield”

and the children’s “ Fablesin Verse” is this remark under- 
neath: 
“¢There was an old Woman who liv’d under a hill, 
And if she ’s not gone, she lives there still.’ 
“This is a self evident Proposition, which is the very essence of 
Truth. She lived under the hill, and if she ’s not gone, she lives there 
still. Nobody will presume to contradi& this. Croesa.” 
And is not this also a good-natured imitation of that kind 
of seriously intended information which Mr. Edgeworth in- 
serted some thirty years later in “Harry and Lucy:” “Dry, 
what is not wet”? Again this note is appended to 
“See Saw Margery Daw 
Jacky shall have a new master:” 
“It is a mean and scandalous Prattise in Authors to put 
Notes to Things that deserve no Notice.” Who except Gold- 
smith was capable of this vein of humor? 
When Munroe and Francis in Boston undertook about 
eighteen hundred and twenty-four to republish these old- 
fashioned rhymes, in the pra¢tice of the current theory that 
everything must be simplified, they omitted all these notes 
and changed many of the “Melodies.” Sir Walter Scott’s 
“Donnel Dhu” was included, and the beautiful Shakespeare 
selections, “ When Daffodils begin to ’pear,” “When the Bee 
sucks,” etc., were omitted. Doubtless the American editors 
thought that they had vastly improved upon the Newbery 
publication in every word changed and every line omitted. 
In reality, they deprived the nursery of much that might well 
have remained as it was, although certain expressions were 
very properly altered. In a negative manner they did one

surprising and fortunate thing: in leaving out the amusing 
notes they did not attempt to replace them, and consequently 
the nursery had one book free from that advice and precept, 
which in other verse for children resulted in persistent nag- 
ging. The illustrations were entirely redrawn, and Abel Bowen 
and Nathaniel Dearborn were asked to do the engraving for 
this Americanized edition. 
Of the poetry written in America for children before eight- 
een hundred and forty there is little that need be said. Much 
of it was entirely religious in character and most of it was color- 
less and dreary stuff. The “ Child’s Gem” of eighteen hundred 
and thirty-eight, considered a treasury of precious verse by one 
reviewer, and issued in embossed morocco binding, was char- 
acteristic of many contemporary poems, in which nature was 
forced to exude precepts of virtue and industry. The following 
stanzas are no exception to the general tone of the contents of 
practically every book entitled “Poetry for Children:” 
“Be good, little Edmund,’ your mother will say, 
She will whisper it soft in your ear, 
And often repeat it, by night and by day 
That you may not forget it, my dear. 
“And the ant at its work, and the flower-loving bee 
And the sweet little bird in the wood 
As it warbles its song, from its nest in the tree, 
Seems to say, ‘little Eddy be good.’” 
The change in the character of the children’s books written 
by Americans had begun to be seriously noticed in England. 
Although there were still many importations (suchas the series 
written by Mrs. Sherwood), there was some inclination to re-

  Forgotten Books of the 
sent the stocking of American booksellers’ shelves by the work 
of local talent, much to the detriment of English publishers’ 
pockets. The literary critics took up the subje&, and thought 
themselves justified in disparaging many of the American 
books which found also ready sale on English book-counters. 
The religious books underwent scathing criticism, possibly 
not undeserved, except that the English productions of the 
same order and time make it now appear that it was but the 
pot calling the kettle black. Almost as much fault was found 
with the story-books. It apparently mattered little that the 
tables were now turned and British publishers were pirating 
American tales as freely and successfully as Thomas and 
Philadelphia printers had in former years made use of New- 
bery’s, and Darton and Harvey’s, juvenile novelties in book 
ware. 
In the “ Quarterly Review” of 1843, in an article entitled 
“Books for Children,” the writer found much cause for com- 
plaint in regard to stories then all too conspicuous in book- 
shops in England. “The same egregious mistakes,” said 
the critic, “as to the nature of a child’s understanding 
—the same explanations, which are all but indelicate, and 
always profane—seem to pervade all these American men- 
tors; and of a number by Peter Parley, Abbott, Todd, &c., 
it matters little which we take up.” “Under the name of 
Peter Parley,” continued the disgruntled gentleman, after 
finding only malicious evil in poor Mr. Todd’s efforts to ex- 
plain religious doétrines, “such a number of juvenile school- 
books are current—some greatly altered from the originals 
and many more by adopters of Mr. Goodrich’s pseudonym 
[2227]
-P-A-G-E-277

—that it becomes difficult to measure the merits or demerits 
of the said magnus parens, Goodrich.” Liberal quotations fol- 
lowed from “ Peter Parley’s Farewell,” which was censured as 
palling to the mind of those familiar with the English sources 
from which the facts had been irreverently culled. 
The reviewer then passed on to another section of ““Ameri- 
can abominations” which “seem to have some claim to pop- 
ularity since they are easily sold.” “These,” continued the 
anonymous critic, “are works not of amusement—those we 
shall touch upon later—but of that half-and-half description 
where instruction blows with a side wind. . .. Accordingly 
after impatient investigation of an immense number of little 
tomes, we are come to the conclusion that they may be briefly 
classified—firstly, as containing such information as any 
child in average life who can speak plainly is likely to be pos- 
sessed of; and secondly, such as when acquired is not worth 
having.” 
To this second class of book the Reverend Mr. Abbott’s 
“Rollo Books” were unhesitatingly consigned. They were re- 
garded as curiosities for “mere occupation of the eye, and 
utter stagnation of the thoughts, full of empty minutiae with 
all the rules of common sense set aside.” 
Next the writer considered the style of those Americans 
who persuaded shillings from English pockets by “ingen- 
iously contrived series which rendered the purchase of a single 
volume by no means so recommendable as that of all.” The 
“uncouth phraseology, crack-jack words, and puritan de- 
rived words are nationalized and therefore do not permit 
cavilling,” continued the reviewer, dismayed and disgusted 
E2233]

that it was necessary to warn his public, “but their children 
never did, or perhaps never will, hear any other language; 
and it is to be hoped they understand it. At all events, we 
have nothing to do but keep ours from it, believing firmly 
that early familiarity with refined and beautiful forms . . . is 
one of the greatest safeguards against evil, if not necessary to 
good.” 
However, the critic did not close his article without a 
good word for those ladies in whose books we ourselves have 
found merit. “Their works of amusement” he considered 
admirable, “when not laden with more religion than the tale 
can hold in solution. Miss Sedgwick takes a high place for 
powers of description and traits of nature, though her lan- 
guage is so studded with Americanisms as much to mar the 
pleasure and perplex the mind of an English reader. Besides 
this lady, Mrs. Sigourney and Mrs. Seba Smith may be 
mentioned. The former, especially, to all other gifts adds a 
refinement, and nationality of subject, with a knowledge of 
life, which some of her poetical pieces led us to expec. In- 
deed the little Americans have little occasion to go begging 
to the history or tradition ot other nations for topics of in- 
terest.” 
The “Westminster Review” of eighteen hundred and 
forty was also in doubt “whether all this Americanism [such 
as Parley’s ‘Tales’ contained] is desirable for English chil- 
dren, were it,” writes the critic, “only for them we keep the 
‘pure well of English undefiled,’ and cannot at all admire the 
improvements which it pleases that go-ahead nation to claim 
the right of making in our common tongue: unwisely enough 
[ 224 ]

as regards themselves, we think, for one of the elements in 
the power of a nation is the wide spread of its language.” 
This same criticism was made again and again about the 
style of American writers for adults, so that it is little won- 
der the children’s books received no unqualified praise. But 
Americanisms were not the worst feature of the “inundation 
of American children’s books,” which because of their novelty 
threatened to swamp the “higher class” English. They were 
feared because of the “multitude of false notions likely to 
be derived from them, the more so as the similarity of name 
and language prevents children from being on their guard, 
and from remembering that the representations that they 
read are by foreigners.” It was the American view of Eng- 
lish institutions (presented in story-book form) which rankled 
in the British breast as a “condescending tenderness of the 
free nation towards the monarchical régime” from which at 
any cost the English child must be guarded. In this respect 
Peter Parley was the worst offender, and was regarded as 
“a sad purveyor of slip-slop, and no matter how amusing, 
ignorant of his subject.” That gentleman, meanwhile, read 
the criticisms and went on making “bread and butter,” while 
he scowled at the English across the water, who criticised, but 
pirated as fast as he published in America. 
Gentle Miss Eliza Leslie received altogether different treat- 
ment in this review of American juvenile literature. She was 
considered “good everywhere, and particularly so for the 
meridian in which her tales were placed;” and we quite agree 
with the reviewer who considered it well worth while to quote 
long paragraphs from her “Tell Tale” to show its character 
[ 225 ] 
 
-P-A-G-E-280
  Forgotten Books of the 
and “truly useful lesson.” “To America,” continued this writer, 
“we also owe a host of little books, that bring together the 
literature of childhood and the people; as ‘Home,’ ‘ Live and 
Let Live’ [by Miss Sedgwick], &c., but excellent in inten- 
tion as they are, we have our doubts, as to the general recep- 
tion they will meet in this country while so much of more 
exciting and elegant food is at hand.” Even if the food of 
amusement in England appeared to the British mind more 
spiced and more elegant, neither Miss Leslie’s nor Miss Sedg- 
wick’s fictitious children were ever anaemic puppets with- 
out wills of their own, —a type made familiar by Miss Edge- 
worth and persisted in by her admirers and successors, —but 
vitalized little creatures, who acted to some degree, at least, 
like the average child who loved their histories and named 
her dolls after favorite characters. 
To-day these English criticisms are only of value as show- 
ing that the American story-book was no longer imitating the 
English tale, but was developing, by reason of the impress 
of differing social forces, a new type. Its faults do not prevent 
us from seeing that the spirit expressed in this juvenile litera- 
ture is that of a new nation feeling its own way, and making 
known its purpose in its own manner. While we smile at 
sedulous endeavors of the serious-minded writers to present 
their convictions, educational, religious, or moral, in palatable 
form, and to consider children always as a race apart, whose 
natural actions were invariably sinful, we still read between 
the lines that these writers were really interested in the welfare 
of the American child; and that they were working according 
to the accepted theories of the third decade of the nineteenth

century as to the constituents of a juvenile library which, 
while “judicious and attractive, should also blend instruétion 
with innocent amusement.” 
And now as we have reached the point in the history of 
the American story-book when it is popular at least in both 
English-speaking countries, if not altogether satisfactory to 
either, what can be said of the value of this juvenile literature 
of amusement which has developed on the tiny pages of well- 
worn volumes? If, of all the books written for children by 
Americans seventy-five years and more ago, only Nathaniel 
Hawthorne’s “ Wonder Book” has survived to the present 
generation; of all the verse produced, only the simple rhyme, 
“Maryhad a Little Lamb,” and Clement Moore’s “ The Night 
before Christmas” are still quoted, has their history any value 
to-day 2 
If we consider that there is nothing more rare in the fiction 
of any nation than the popular child’s story that endures; 
nothing more unusual than the successful well-written juve- 
nile tale, we can perhaps find a value not to be reckoned by 
the survival or literary character of these old-fashioned books, 
but in their silent testimony to the influence of the progress 
of social forces at work even upon so small a thing as a child’s 
toy-book. The successful well-written child’s book has been 
rare, because it has been too often the object rather than the 
manner of writing that has been considered of importance; 
because it has been the aim of all writers either to “improve 
in goodness” the young reader, as when, two hundred years 
ago, Cotton Mather penned “Good Lessons” for his infant son 
to learn at school, or, to quote the editor of “Affection’s Gift” 
[227]

(published a century and a quarter later), it has been for the 
purpose of “imparting moral precepts and elevated senti- 
ments, of uniting instruction and amusement, through the fas- 
cinating mediums of interesting narrative and harmony of 
numbers.” 
The result of both intentions has been a collection of dingy 
or faded duodecimos containing a series of impressions of 
what each generation thought good, religiously, morally, and 
educationally, for little folk. If few of them shed any light 
upon child nature in those long-ago days, many throw shafts 
of illumination upon the change and progress in American 
ideals and thought concerning the welfare of children. As 
has already been said, the press supplied what the public 
taste demanded, and if the writers produced for earlier gen- 
erations of children what may now be considered lumber, the 
press of more modern date has not progressed so far in this 
field of literature as to make it in any degree certain that our 
children’s treasures may not be consigned toan equal oblivion. 
For these too are but composites made by superimposing the 
latest fads or theories as to instruétive amusement of chil- 
dren upon those of previous generations of toy-books. Most 
of what was once considered the “perfume of youth and 
freshness” in a literary way has been discarded as dry and 
unprofitable, mistaken or deceptive; and yet, after all has 
been said by way of criticism of methods and subjects, these 
chap-books, magazines, gift and story books form our best 
if blurred pictures of the amusements and daily life of the 
old-time American child.

of the progress of the arts of book-making and illustration, 
and of the growth of the business of publishing in America;

by one old bookseller, “Tom Thumb’s Maxim in Trade and 
Politics:” “He who buys this book for Two-pence, and lays 
it up till it is worth Three-pence, may get an hundred per 
cent by the bargain.”

  I, INTRODUCTION. 
The purpose of this investigation is two-fold: first, to deter- 
mine the extent to which the scores of individuals in learning

the direction and criticism of this research which was carried out in the psycho- 
logical laboratory of the University of Chicago. This was but a part of a much

the stylus maze are due to individual ability, and to what degree 
they are the result of unknown and uncontrolled factors, i.e., 
chance; and, second, to ascertain the amount and kind of relation- 
ship between the ability of individuals in maze learning and their 
ability in a rational learning test, viz., the Peterson Rational 
Learning Test (1). 
A definition of the terms ‘individual ability’ and ‘chance,’ as 
used in this study, and the method by which the two are sepa- 
rated; may be indicated by the following examples. Suppose 
that the scores of individuals A, B, C, and D have the ranks of 
1, 2,3, and 4, respectively, in any maze, and that the same individ- 
uals learn other mazes in which their scores continue to maintain 
the same ranks. Under such circumstances, it may be presumed 
that each individual possesses, in a degree peculiar to himself, 
some constant factor which is responsible for the position which 
his score invariably assumes with respect to the scores of the sev- 
eral individuals in the group. This factor we have called the 
individual’s ability to learn mazes. It follows, then, that con- 
sistent differences between the scores of several individuals would 
indicate individual differences in maze learning ability. 
On the other hand, if there is apparently no relationship be- 
tween the ranks of subjects in one maze and their ranks in other 
mazes, we may presume that the order of ranking in any maze is 
a matter of chance, and that the scores of individuals in maze 
learning are not indicative of individual differences in ability. 
Using this logic, we may determine the extent to which indi- 
viduals’ scores tend to remain relatively the same from maze to 
maze, and conclude from such data concerning the relative in- 
fluence of individual ability versus chance in determining such 
scores. Other problems subsidiary to this one will be treated 
during the course of the paper, and will be stated in the sections, 
in which they are discussed. 
The method of attack upon the second problem, stated above, 
is also based upon a comparison of the relative rankings of the 
scores of the subjects in the two problems. If the ranks of the 
scores of the individuals are the same in the rational learning 
problem as they are in the maze, then it may be presumed that, 
 
-P-A-G-E-5
    ABILITY VS. CHANCE IN LEARNING STYLUS MAZE 3 
for all practical purposes, the ability to learn the two sorts of 
problems is identical. If, however, there is no relationship be- 
tween the ranks of the scores in the two problems, there are two 
possible conclusions. First, the ranking in either one or the other, 
or both, is purely a matter of chance or, second, the ability re- 
quired to learn one problem is totally unrelated to the ability 
required to learn the other problem. Since the degree to which 
the first possibility actually obtains, may be determined, as in- 
dicated above, we may, having found the extent to which the 
scores in the mazes correlate with the scores in the rational learn- 
ing tests, draw conclusions concerning the identity of the abilities 
required in the two sorts of learning. 
The literature bearing upon each problem will be summarized 
in the section devoted to those problems and discussed with re- 
ference to the data presented in this paper. 
Il, APPARATUS AND METHOD 
In the present experiment, five mazes of different pattern were 
used. These mazes were made in the University of Chicago lab- 
oratory, and consist of a metal plate (generally brass) in which 
grooves are milled, forming the pattern desired. The pattern 
of each of the mazes forms a square of approximately 64 inches. 
The grooves are 3% of an inch in depth and $ of an inch in width, 
The partitions separating the grooves are of the same width as 
the latter. The stylus which the subject uses in running thru 
the maze is of such size that it will slide easily thru the 
grooves, but allows very little play from side to side. Each 
maze is equipped at the end of its path with an electrical con- 
tact which, when touched by the stylus, causes a bell to ring, 
thus informing the subject that he has completed the route thru 
the maze. 
The patterns of the five mazes are shown in figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 
and 5. 
The stylus mazes were securely fastened to a table which was 
of such a height that it caused a minimum of fatigue to the arm 
of the subject. Over the maze there was arranged a large black 
hood, beneath which the subject could move his hand freely and
-P-A-G-E-6

yet be unable to see the maze, thus obviating the necessity of a 
blindfold. The hood was open in the back, i.e., on the side of the 
table opposite to the subject, where the experimenter sat, and 
recorded the errors made in going thru the maze.

There were two rational learning tests given. The first was 
made up of the first ten letters in the alphabet, each of which 
had to be associated with a number from one to ten arranged in 
an irregular order. The second test was made of the first fif- 
teen letters in the alphabet and the numbers from one to fifteen 
inclusive.

which were not clear to him. The instructions for the rational 
learning tests were patterned after those used by Peterson. They 
were presented to the subject in the same way as the instruc- 
tions for the stylus maze. The two sets of instructions follow:

from one to ten. I call out the letters in their order and you are 
to guess numbers for each letter until you get the correct one, 
then I say ‘“‘right.’”” Then I call out the next letter, and so on. 
This continues until you get each number right, the first guess,

but are to use all the mental power at your command. You will 
be judged by (1) the total time you take, (2) the number of errors 
made, or wrong guesses, every number you call out being a guess, 
and (3) the number of repetitions from A to J required.? 
There was no fixed time between trials but the subject was 
urged to avoid fatigue which would be detrimental to his learn- 
ing. A maze was learned in one sitting, except in a few cases 
when the time required amounted to 13 hours or over. In such 
cases the subject would be allowed to rest for a time or engage in 
some other activity. 
The subjects came once a week, and thus learned one maze 
per week. After having learned the first maze they were allowed 
to look at that maze, and they were allowed to look at every 
succeeding maze after they had learned it. 
The subjects were students in the elementary courses in psy-~ 
chology who volunteered for the work, and a few of the graduate. 
students in psychology who had no previous knowledge of the: 
maze problem. They were, then, for the most part, sophomores: 
in college, since students with less than nine majors of work can-~ 
not register for courses in the Department of Psychology. In 
other words, they were as nearly as possible the same sort of a 
group as would be available for use to any one doing a maze 
problem. 
There were in all 107 subjects used. All of these, however, didnot 
learn every maze, because some found it necessary to drop the work 
before it was entirely completed. The number of subjects whose 
records are used in each computation will be given in the results. 
The data taken and used in the calculations are the number of 
trials (including the four perfect trials required for mastery) to 
learn the problem, the total time consumed in actual work, and 
the total errors made during the progress of the learning. These 
three different sorts of data were taken for the learning of both 
the mazes and the rational learning problems. 
The mazes were learned in the order in which they are repre- 
sented in figures 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Then, mazes 1, 2, and 4 were

repeated. These mazes will be referred to the second time that 
they are given by the numbers of 1A, 2A, and 4A, respectively. 
‘The subjects were not told that they were to have again the maze 
which they had already learned’, and but few of them made any 
‘spontaneous remark indicating that they recognized such mazes. 
If they did so, they were asked to say nothing to any one else 
about it. 
During the same sitting that the subjects learned maze 2A they 
were also required to learn the ten letter rational learning test 
(R. L. 1), and with the learning of maze 4A they learned the 
fifteen letter rational learning test (R. L. 2). 
The method of dealing with the data thus obtained has been 
varied with each of the particular problems which are discussed. 
The descriptions of such methods will be given along with the 
presentation of the particular problems to which they apply. 
Ill, THE RELATIVE INFLUENCE OF DIFFERENCES IN ABILITY 
AND CHANCE UPON THE INDIVIDUAL SCORES IN MAZE 
LEARNING 
1. Historical summary 
There has been no systematic work published which bears, 
even remotely, upon this problem. There are, however, several 
incidental references to it in the literature. One of these is in 
‘Webb’s monograph (2) on transfer of training and retroaction. 
He worked with both rats and human subjects. His method 
which is slightly different than that used in this study, was to 
have a group of subjects learn one maze (A), then to learn an- 
other maze, and then to relearn maze A, thirty days after the 
completion of its original learning. The control group learned 
maze A, rested thirty days, and then relearned. The interpola- 
ted mazes were five in number for the rats (designated by the 
letters B, C, D, E, and F), and three for the human subjects 
(B,C, and D). He used from five to eleven subjects in his groups 
of rats, and from three to six subjects in his human groups. The 
table of correlations (rank method) which he gives is reproduced 
in table 1. 
 
-P-A-G-E-13
  ABILITY VS. CHANCE IN LEARNING STYLUS MAZE ik 
Webb (see Webb, page 78) says of this table that 
The majority of the values are too small to be significant, and only 
16 of the 30 values are positive. From this it appears that there is 
no general tendency towards a positive correlation between the two 
sets of values. The differences between the humans and rats, the 
control and test groups, and the various mazes, are apparently not 
significant.

Webb also gives other data in support of the above statement 
(see page 64 of his monograph). He attributes this lack of 
correlation to ‘‘individual differences in susceptibility to the 
disintegrating influences of intervening conditions.” He fails to 
consider, at this point, that the lack of correlation may be due to 
chance factors operating in the actual process of learning and 
relearning.  
-P-A-G-E-14
  12 WILLIAM T, HERON 
A systematic investigation of the relationship between individ- 
ual scores of rats in the same maze, by a somewhat different 
method than that used in the present study, was initiated by 
D. G. Paterson in the Pyschological Laboratory of the University 
of Kansas, but his work was never carried to completion by him-. 
self. His plan was to allow the rats to learn the maze partially, 
rest for a certain period of time, and then, again, partially to 
learn the same maze. It was continued a year later by Miss 
Oakland Maupin in the same laboratory. Her work has not 
yet been published. 
Coincident with Miss Maupin’s work there was an investi- 
gation made in the Kansas laboratory from which some data were 
obtained which bear upon our problem. This work was done by 
Hunter (3) who used, with rats, a circular maze with the turns 
left-right, left-right, etc. Twenty-four hours after the rats had 
learned this maze, he put them in the same circular maze but 
with the turns rearranged so that they were right-left, right-left, 
‘etc. He correlated the records of the animals in these two mazes, 
cand says, 
The Pearson correlation between total trials required for habit 
No. 1 and the total trials required for habit No. 2, using the records of 
36 animals, is 0.3140.10. For total time, the foot-rule coefficient is 
‘0.126--0.07. Using the 25 rats for whom alone distance records were 
available, the foot-rule correlation of total distances traversed during 
learning is —0.02=+-0.08 and for net time is 0.36-£0.08.   
For 31 human subjects he used a rectangular maze, but went 
through the same procedure of having the subjects learn the 
maze in the left-right order and then having them relearn it with 
the turns reversed. He says, 
The foot-rule correlation between total time in the two habits is 
‘0.64-+0.07. The same coefficient for total trials is 0.68 0.07. Trans- 
lating these values by table into the Pearson r gives in each case a 
coefficient above 0.80. 
Further correlations bearing on this topic are in be found in 
Bagg’s monograph (4) on individual differences in mice. He gave 
a group of 93 mice the following four problems: 
 
-P-A-G-E-15
  
ae 
ABILITY VS. CHANCE IN LEARNING STYLUS MAZE 18 
I. Seventeen trials in a maze, designed by Professor Cattell, and 
constructed in such a manner that the mice had to learn, in each section, 
which door to push open so that they could pass into the next section. 
Between each section there were two doors, one of which was locked and 
the other free to open. 
II. Twelve trials in the same maze, except that the doors which 
were previously locked were now open, and vice versa. This he called 
an “interference test.” 
III. Twenty-five trials in a multiple choice apparatus in which they 
had to choose one of three possibilities. 
IV. Ten trials in a “retention test’’ of the maze in which the “gates 
were open in the same order as during the last ten trials of the inter- 
ference test.” 
He obtained the following correlations by the rank method.* 
1. Time in the last 15 trials of test I with time in test IV=0.35. 
2. Time in the last 15 trials of test I with time in the first 2 trials of 
test II = 0.55 
3. Time in the last 15 trials of test I with time in the last 10 trials 
of test II=0.49 
The results of Webb and Hunter indicate that individual abil- 
ity has little influence upon the scores of rats in the learning and 
relearning of the same maze (Webb) or in the learning of two 
mazes (Hunter). The influence of this factor upon the scores of 
human beings is apparently greater, although no definite state- 
ment can be made from the results at hand. 
It is hardly fair to compare Bagg’s results with those of the 
other investigators quoted. While his correlations are, on the 
whole, somewhat higher than those for rats given above, and pos- 
sess a higher degree of statistical validity because of the larger 
number of cases, yet the fact that he separated the first two trials 
from the remainder in making his correlations destroys their 
value for comparative purposes with the results. of the other in- 
vestigators. The arbitrarily chosen number of trials which all 
rats were forced to run, regardless of their stage of learning, also   3 The correlations which he gives with test III as a variable will be quoted 
when we come to consider the second problem of this paper. 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
  14 WILLIAM T. HERON 
make comparison difficult. However, disregarding the consider- 
ation of the influence of these variations in conditions upon the 
magnitude of the correlation, the highest coefficient which he ob- 
tains is 0.55 which indicates that individual ability and chance 
have, roughly speaking, equal parts in the production of the 
scores. 
2. Results of the present experiment 
In the present experiment a large number of correlations have 
been calculated which bear upon this problem. These correla- 
tions have been divided into three sets or groups, as follows: 
A. Inter-correlations of the scores made in the first five mazes. 
B. Inter-correlations of the scores made in the three mazes the 
second time that they were given. 
C. Correlations of the scores made in the original learning of 
the three mazes with the scores made in relearning the same 
mazes. 
The net result of these correlations is to show that the rela- 
tive influence of chance and individual ability varies with the pat- 
tern of the maze. In some mazes chance is so effective that the 
influence of individual ability upon the scores is practically neg- 
ligible. In other mazes, roughly speaking, chance and individ- 
ual ability play about equal parts in the production of the scores. 
In no maze can it be said that individual ability consistently 
plays a dominant part. The results which lead to these conclu- 
sions are presented in the following tables. 
A. Inter-correlations of the scores made in the first five mazes.— 
The correlation coefficients obtained by correlating each maze 
with every other maze of the series of five mazes are presented in 
table 2. 
In studying table 2 the following points should be noted: (a) 
the values of the correlations with reference to the two factors of 
chance and maze learning ability; (b) the variations in the values 
of the correlations for the different mazes; and, (c) the variations 
in the values of the correlations for the different criteria. 
4 The Pearson formula was used in the calculation of all correlation coefficients.

(a) In the table of 30 correlations there are only 8 which are 
above 0.40, and half of these are above 0.50. The lowest coeffi- 
cient is 0.02, and there are 12 which fall below 0.30. Conse- 
quently, the average coefficient for trials in 0.34, for time 0.29, 
and for errors 0.34. The magnitude of these correlations indi- 
cate that for mazes, in general, the relationship between indi- 
viduals’ scores is not very great. It is not possible, therefore, to 
select a maze at random which could be relied upon to indicate

individual differences, since these correlations show that differ- 
ences between scores are largely due to chance. 
It cannot, however, be said that there is no relationship what- 
ever between the scores in the different mazes, for it should be 
noted that all but 8 of the coefficients indicate a real positive 
relationship between the variables correlated, using the gener- 
ally accepted criterion of four times the probable error as an indi- 
cation of the reliability of a correlation coefficient. To the ex- 
tent to which this relationship exists, we can say that differences 
 
-P-A-G-E-18

in individual ability to learn mazes are responsible for differences 
in the scores of individuals. However, this relationship is, in gen- 
eral, so small that the maze is shown to be of little value as an 
accurate indicator of gradations of ability in individuals. That 
is to say, chance plays such a large part in the production of 
scores in maze learning that the influence of practically all grada- 
tions of ability upon individual scores, is effectively offset by the 
variations in those scores made by chance alone. This statement 
applies to mazes in general, and the possibility that some may 
be less liable to this indictment than others is discussed below. 
(b) An inspection of the table shows that the values of the 
coefficients vary a great deal for different mazes. The average 
correlation (time, errors, and trials combined) for mazes 4 and 5 
is 0.19 higher than that for any of the other variables listed. This

shows that the scores in these two mazes are to a much larger ex- 
tent the products of individual differences.in ability than are the 
scores in the other mazes. These average coefficients are listed 
in table 3. 
(ec) In order to show the relationship between the three dif- 
ferent criteria and the size of the correlations, the coefficients of 
table 2 have been ranked and put in tabular form in table 4. 
The table shows that the three criteria agree remarkably well 
when extremes are considered. The agreement is not so close 
for those coefficients which are between the extremes. However, 
out of a possible displacement of 8 places, the displacement be- 
tween trials and time is never more than 4, between trials and 
errors never more than 4, and between time and errors never 
more than 5 places. On the basis of this and the fact that there 
 
-P-A-G-E-19

is practically no difference in the averages of the correlations, 
using time, trials, and errors, respectively, it is apparent that 
there is no difference among the three in the way that they are 
affected by individual ability and chance.

this section are those relating to the inter-correlations of the 
scores in the repeated mazes (1A, 2A, and 4A). These coeffi- 
cients are presented in table 5. 
These coefficients are lower than the corresponding correlations 
in table 2, except for two cases, namely, mazes 2A and 4A with 
trials and errors. However, the increase in:these two cases is 
 
-P-A-G-E-20
  18 WILLIAM T. HERON 
so slight as to be negligible, and furthermore, none of the corre- 
lations indicate a real relationship, according to the criterion of 
four times the probable error. These correlations, therefore, add 
further evidence in support of the conclusion that, in general, 
individual differences in maze ability have little influence in the 
production of the scores in maze learning. 
It is possible, however, that if maze 5 had been repeated as 
well as maze 4 that they would have correlated practically as 
closely as they did when given for the first time. The indications,

from the data at hand, are, however, that this would not have 
been the case, since mazes 1 and 4 gave an average correlation 
for the three criteria of 0.40 in the original learning and in the 
relearning a corresponding average of only 0.20. A possible ex- 
planation of this is the fact that the data were much more ho- 
mogeneous in the relearning than in the original learning, owing 
to the presence of positive transfer. 
C. Correlations of the scores made in the original learning of the 
three mazes with the scores made in relearning the same mazes. A 
third source of material bearing on our first problem is the cor- 
 
-P-A-G-E-21
ABILITY VS. CHANCE IN LEARNING STYLUS MAZE 19 
relation between the scores made in the original learning of 
mazes 1, 2, and 4 and the relearning of the same. These data are 
presented in table 6. 
The data in this table show the same tendency as that already 
discovered in table 2, namely, that individual differences in 
ability have a more important rdle in determining the scores in 
some mazes than in others. The table shows that maze 4 and 
its repetition 4A correlate the highest for every criterion. Maze 1 
and 1A are the second best, while the coefficients for mazes 2 
and 2A are practically no better than zero. The table further 
shows that under these conditions, contrary to that which was 
found above (see page 16), the different criteria are not equally 
affected by the two opposing factors of individual ability and 
chance, and, furthermore, that no one criterion is affected in a.con- 
sistent manner for all mazes when individual coefficients are con- 
sidered. On the average, however, trials is the least affected by 
chance. The average correlation for that criterion is 0.59. For 
errors it is 0.40, and for times it is 0.27, disregarding in every 
case the coefficient for mazes 2 and 2A, since they are uniformly 
of no value. 
8. The susceptibility of different individuals to chance influences 
The correlation coefficients, presented above, show that in- 
dividual ability and chance have a reciprocal influence on the 
scores in maze learning when the group is considered as a whole. 
The question which arises, then, is how nearly the scores of all 
individuals are affected in a similar manner by these two factors. 
In order to determine this the scores of the individuals were ranked 
in each of the five mazes, and the maximum and average varia- 
bility of each subject calculated. The maximum variability was 
found by subtracting the lowest rank which the individual ob- 
tained from his highest. The average variability was obtained 
by subtracting every rank from every other rank and averaging 
the differences. The average rank of each individual was also 
obtained in order to find if there is any relationship between the 
average relative efficiency in the five mazes and variability. These 
three values are shown in table 7 for trials only, since it was not 
thought profitable to go through the same process for all criteria.

Table 7 shows that all individuals are not equally affected by 
chance, i.e., some individuals are more or less consistent than 
others. This is indicated by the range of average variability 
which is from 3.5 to 41.8 with the average at 24.2. The range 
of maximum variability is much greater, being from 8 to 84 with 
the average at 42.2. 
The average variabilities fall upon a normal distribution curve 
and the maximum variations show the same tendency, although 
to a lesser extent. The distribution of the average variabilities 
is shown in table 8.

The figures in table 8 show that there are a few cases which 
are extremely variable or inconsistent and a few which are ex- 
tremely consistent. If we regard an average variability of 10 
points or less as very consistent there are four cases which would 
fall into such a group. Likewise, if we consider that a variability 
of over 36 points is extremely inconsistent, than 9 cases would 
fall into that group. The great majority of cases, however, 
range around the average. Thus there are 56 cases (about two- 
thirds of the total group) whose average variabilities range be- 
tween 16 and 30 points. The other 21 cases of the 90 lie between 
the extreme and average groups. 
The question of the relationship of variability and efficiency 
or in other words, the consideration of whether the good, poor, 
 
-P-A-G-E-25
  ABILITY VS. CHANCE IN LEARNING STYLUS MAZE 23 
or mediocre subjects in maze learning are the more variable, may 
be dealt with by comparing the relative size of each individual’s 
average rank with the relative size of his maximum or average 
variability. In order to facilitate this comparison the individ- 
uals are arranged in table 7 in the order of their average ranks. 
To facilitate still further the comparison, the 15 most consistent 
individuals and the 15 most inconsistent have been put in a 
separate table together with the rank of their average ranks. 
These data are presented in table 9. In this table the figures in 
the first column are the numbers of the respective subjects, 
those in the second column are the ranks of each subject’s average 
rank in the five mazes, and the figures in the third column are the 
ranks of each subject’s average variation. Thus, for example, 
in the case of subject 21, 3 in the second column means that his 
average rank was the third lowest in the group of 90 subjects, 
and 1 means that his average variation is the lowest in the group. 
The results in table 9 show that the subjects who have a very 
high or very low average rank tend also to be the less variable. 
This is, of course, to be expected since in order to have a low aver- 
age rank, the individual’s ranks in most of the mazes must also 
be low. Consequently, this would tend to result in a low varia- 
bility. Likewise, the individual who has a very high average 
rank must have high ranks in the majority of the mazes with 
the result that his variability would also be low. 
Those subjects who are very inconsistent vary a great deal in 
respect to their average rank in the mazes. They hold relative 
positions in efficiency in maze learning which range between 8 
and 70. The evidence shows, then, that, when extremes are not 
considered, an individual may make relatively good or relatively 
poor records on the average in maze learning and show a very 
great degree of variability or inconsistency between separate 
mazes. There can be said, therefore, to be little relationship 
between efficiency and variability except in the cases of the ex- 
tremely efficient or inefficient subjects, where a relationship may 
be anticipated on a priori grounds.

4. Conclusions 
Our concern, up to this point, has been a consideration of 
the influence of differences in ability versus chance on the in- 
dividual scores of subjects in learning mazes. Our results have 
shown (1) that the’ two factors under investigation vary with 
the pattern of the maze in the respective parts which they play in 
 
-P-A-G-E-27
    
ABILITY VS. CHANCE IN LEARNING STYLUS MAZE 25 
the determination of such scores. They also show (2) that in no 
case is individual ability very much more influential than chance, 
but (8) that in some cases chance is very markedly more influ- 
ential than individual ability. It has also been shown (4) that 
individuals differ in the degree or relative consistency which they 
exhibit in maze learning, and (5) that there is little relationship 
between consistency and efficiency. 
IV. THE RELATIVE INFLUENCE OF DIFFERENCES IN INDIVIDUAL 
ABILITY AND CHANCE UPON GROUP AVERAGES 
OF SCORES IN MAZE LEARNING 
The problem to be considered in this section is one which nat- 
urally follows upon the outcome of our consideration of the rel- 
ative influence of differences in ability and chance upon scores 
in maze learning. Since, it was found that both of these factors 
are influential in the production of such scores, it is necessary 
that we should consider the way in which the two factors will 
interact when the scores are combined into averages. The prob- 
lem, which is two-fold, may be stated specifically as follows: 
first, what is the possibility of summing scores in maze learning 
in such a way that the differences in the several averages of such 
sums will be mainly due to differences in maze learning ability 
of the subjects who compose such groups, and, second, what is 
the possibility of summing several groups of the same scores in 
such a. way that the differences in the averages of such sums will 
be chance differences and not assignable to any known factor. 
The two aspects of the problem will be treated separately. 
1. What is the possibility of summing scores in such a way that the 
differences in the several averages of such sums will be mainly 
due to differences in the maze learning ability of the subjects who 
compose such groups? 
This aspect of the problem arises from the fact that differences 
in individual ability are not sufficiently great to cause the rank- 
ings of the scores of subjects in maze learning to be constant 
from maze to maze. If the rankings were constant in maze 
learning, then, it is obvious that the averages of two or more
-P-A-G-E-28
26 WILLIAM T. HERON 
groups, selected upon the basis of their efficiency in any maze, 
would retain their same ralative positions in all mazes. 
On the other hand, if the rankings of the same subjects in 
several mazes are not constant, then several possibilities present 
themselves with regard to the averages of two or more groups of 
such subjects selected upon their efficiency in any one maze. 
For example, let us suppose that the scores in mazes R, S, and 
T for subjects A, B, C, and D are as follows: 
  
  SUBJECT MAZE R MAZES. maze T 
A 10 8 12 
B 16 12 20 
Cc 20 20 13 
D 26 14 15 
  
The averages, then, of two groups divided upon the basis of 
their efficiency in maze R would be 13 and 23, respectively. The 
averages of two groups, each of the same constituency, in maze 
8S would be 10 and 17, respectively. The correlation between 
the ranks of the scores in the two mazes is about 0.60. Here, 
then, is a case in which differences in ability are not great enough 
to overcome completely the influence of chance in the production 
of the individual scores, but are, nevertheless, sufficiently powerful 
to force the averages of the two groups into the same relative 
position that the averages of the same groups occupy in another 
maze, where, by reason of the method of selection, individual 
differences and chance have been combined to give such averages 
their respective positions. In such a case, however, we cannot 
say that the difference in the averages is an accurate measure 
of the difference in the ability of the two groups, since chance 
may influence the difference in the averages, without causing 
them to inter-change positions, for instance, by lowering the 
score of A in maze § or increasing the score of C. 
When mazes R, and T are considered, however, the situation 
is different. Here the averages of the two groups are 16 and 14, 
respectively, and the correlation is 0.20. In this case, individual 
differences in ability, while sufficiently great to produce the cor- 
 
-P-A-G-E-29
  ABILITY VS. CHANCE IN LEARNING STYLUS MAZE 27 
relation of 0.20, were, nevertheless, unable to cause the averages 
to retain the relative position which they occupy in mazes R 
and §. 
In this section, a group of 90 subjects, for whom records were 
available in five mazes, were divided into smaller groups of 
varying sizes upon the basis of their efficiency in maze 4, for each 
of the three criteria separately. It has already been indicated 
that the results of this method of division are influenced by 
both chance and individual ability. . This follows from the fact 
that it was found (within the limits of this experiment) that indi- 
vidual ability and chance are both responsible in a reciprocal de- 
gree for the scores of individuals in maze learning. Therefore, 
the fact that a person ranks first in maze 4 is not a certain in- 
dication that that person has the greatest maze learning ability, 
but only that he, together with those individuals who rank near 
the first, tend to have greater ability to learn mazes than those 
persons who rank lower. Consequently, the difference between 
the averages of two groups of individuals, one of which ranks 
higher than the other in maze 4, must not be taken as an abso- 
lute measure of difference in ability of the two groups, but it 
does indicate a difference in ability when it is found that the aver- 
ages of the same groups in other mazes retain their same relative 
positions. 
It also follows from what has been said of the reciprocal rela- 
tionship between individual ability and chance, that the larger 
the groups into which a limited number of subjects are divided 
the greater is the probability that the differences in the averages 
of such groups will represent differences in maze learning ability, 
for the larger the number of subjects in a group the greater is 
the range over which chance may operate and still not displace 
the individual from the group in which his particular degree of 
ability would place him were it the only factor involved. 
In the present section, the group of 90 subjects was divided into 
smaller groups of different sizes as follows: 
A. The group was divided into fifths. This division makes 
five groups of 18 subjects each. 
B. The group was divided into thirds. This division makes 
three groups of 30 subjects each.  
-P-A-G-E-30
  28 WILLIAM T, HERON 
C. The group was divided into halves. This division makes 
two groups of 45 subjects each. 
As has already been mentioned, these divisions were made sepa- 
rately for each criterion and were made on the basis of the re- 
spective subjects’ efficiency (i. e., size of score) in maze 4. 
When each of the 90 subjects is included in one of the several 
groups, the results show (1) that it is possible to find groups, 
the differences in the average scores of which indicate differences _ 
in maze learning ability of the groups. (2) That these groups 
may be composed of as few as 30 subjects, but the differences are 
more indicative of differences in ability if 45 subjects are used 
per group. (3) That the subjects who make extremely low or 
extremely high scores (especially the latter) in maze 4 tend to 
make similar scores in other mazes more often than do those sub- 
jects whose scores rank around the average in maze 4. The 
results leading to these conclusions are presented below. 
A. Results for groups of 18 subjects each. ‘The averages of each 
of the five groups for each of the five mazes are given in table 10. 
The numbers in parentheses are the ranks of these averages for 
each maze. 
The data in this table show that there is a greater tendency 
for the averages to keep their relative positions than for them 
to fluctuate. The amount of fluctuation issummarized in table 11. 
The maximum number of fluctuations possible for any one fifth 
for all criteria is 12, and the maximum number of places of pos- 
sible displacement is 4. Thus it is seen that the number of fluc- 
tuations actually present is, in general, rather small as com- 
pared with the possibilities, although the fact that chance would 
operate to reduce the maximum number of probable fluctuations 
is not considered. Trials show a greater consistency than either 
of the other criteria, there being only one displacement with it, 
and that being merely the interchanging of the ranks of the third 
and fourth fifths in maze 2. 
The data also lend support to the conclusion that the extremes 
fluctuate less than the average. Especially is this true of those 
subjects who make extremely high scores in maze 4 (i.e., the fifth 
fifth) who have only one fluctuation to their credit.

90 subjects has been divided into two groups in such a way that 
one group has on the average more maze learning ability than the 
other, although, for the reasons already pointed out, we can say 
practically nothing concerning the degree of difference between 
the two. | 
It has been shown above that when two groups of 45 subjects 
each (selected from 90 subjects on the basis of their scores in one 
maze) are considered, the differences in the averages of such 
groups denote actual differences in the average maze learning 
abilities of those groups. The question then arises as to how 
 
-P-A-G-E-33
  ABILITY VS. CHANCE IN LEARNING STYLUS MAZE 31 
nearly such differences in averages represent a difference in the 
maze learning ability of each separate individual composing the 
respective groups. To illustrate: Suppose that the four indi- 
viduals A, B, C, and D have scores of 8, 16, 17, and 31 respec- 
tively, in the maze upon the basis of which they were divided 
into two groups. Then A and B would compose one group with 
an average score of 12 while C and D would compose the other 
group with an average score of 24. In another maze, however, 
the scores might be respectively, 10, 16, 16, and 34. Then the 
averages of these two groups, in order, would be 13 and 25. The 
averages in the two mazes would retain their same relative posi-

tions. If several more mazes were added with the averages still 
behaving in the same manner, we would say that the differences 
in the averages represent real differences in the maze learning 
ability of the two groups. But the example shows that this dif- 
ference may be due to special cases, in this instance to subjects 
A and D, and that subjects B and C are possessed, for all prac- 
tical purposes, of the same ability. Consequently, while the 
groups of which they are parts differ in ability, still these par- 
ticular subjects do not share in that difference. 
It is necessary then that an attempt should be made to de- 
termine, whether the fact that the averages of the two groups 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
  32 i WILLIAM T. HERON 
of 45 subjects each remain in their same relative position for five 
mazes is made possible because each subject of the group shares, 
in some measure, the responsibility for this result, or whether 
only a few individuals are responsible for it. 
We have tried to throw some light upon this problem in two 
different ways: (1) The averages of each of the two groups for 
each of the five mazes have been plotted and their standard de- 
viations laid off on each side. Then by observing the amount of 
overlapping, one may determine, to some extent, the number of 
cases which are responsible for the difference in the two averdges 
in question. (2) The number of individuals who remain con- 
sistently in either one of the two halves for all five mazes was found 
by the comparison of the ranks of each individual in each maze. 
This gives some indication of whether there are certain individ-— 
uals who tend consistently to keep the averages of the various 
groups in the same relative position for all mazes. 
First let us consider the plots of averages and standard devia- 
tions. In these graphs which are shown in figures 6, 7 and 8, 
the different mazes are represented on the base line, and the values 
on the vertical axis represent either trials, time or errors. The 
broken heavy line connects the points which represent the aver- 
ages of the half making the higher score (more time, trials, or errors) 
in each maze. The solid heavy line connects the corresponding 
averages for the group making the lower record. The standard 
deviations are laid off on each side of the averages, and connected 
by lightly drawn lines of a similar form to that of the line con- 
necting the averages of which they are the deviations. The 
distance, then, between the two lightly drawn lines of the same 
form represents the range which includes two-thirds of the cases 
included in the average. Consequently, by comparing the over- 
lapping of the areas inclosed, respectively, by the lightly drawn 
solid and broken lines, it is at once apparent how much the differ- 
ences in the averages is due to a general tendency of the group as a 
whole or to extreme cases. An inspection of the graphs shows 
that this overlapping is so great in all cases, except maze 4 
(which was used as the basis of division of the group) that it 
must be concluded that the difference in the averages is largely

  due to extreme cases, i.e. those individuals who make very high 
or very low scores. 
Let us then consider the problem (2) with reference to the 
number of individuals who remain consistently in one or 
the other half for five mazes. While the overlapping of 
the areas enclosed by the standard deviations indicate that ex- 
treme cases are mainly responsible for the differences in the aver- 
ages of the two groups of 45 subjects each, yet it is obvious that 
the subjects who are at the extremes in one maze are not 
necessarily the same subjects who are at the extremes in another 
maze. Consequently, it is not possible to separate out a group 
of subjects making extreme scores and show that they are the 
particular subjects who are mainly responsible for the fact that 
the averages of the two groups retain their same relative positions. 
It is possible, however, to select a group of subjects from each 
half, whose scores remain consistently in the same half, and who 
are, therefore, ore responsible for the relative positions of the 
averages than those subjects whose scores fluctuate from one half 
to the other as succeeding mazes are considered. The subjects, 
then, whose ranks in any maze were never below 45 were removed 
from the half having the lower score, and the subjects whose ranks 
in any maze were never above 46 were removed from the half 
having the higher score. It was found that for errors 20 subjects 
were consistent in this way, 10 in the lower half and 10 in the 
higher half. For time there were 22 subjects showing the same 
consistency, 10 in the lower half and 12 in the higher. For trials 
there were 21,9 in the lower and 12 in the higher. It was also 
found that the scores of these subjects tended toward the ex- 
tremes in the majority of the cases. 
In order to determine the precise effect which such cases have 
upon the relative positions of the averages of the halves, the 
averages were computed with their records removed. In table 
14 a comparison is given of the averages obtained in these two 
different ways,—in terms of the difference between the averages 
of the first and second half then computed with the consistent 
cases included, and the difference between the two halves when 
such cases are removed. |
-P-A-G-E-39
  ABILITY VS. CHANCE IN LEARNING STYLUS MAZE 87 
Table 14 shows that the removal of the records of the consist~ 
ent cases results in (1) a reduction of the differences between the 
averages of the first and second halves, and (2) in some cases the 
relative positions of the averages are reversed as indicated by the 
minus signs. These facts lead to the conclusion that the differ- 
ences in maze ability, as indicated by the averages of two groups 
of 45 subjects each, selected from a group of 90 on the basis of 
their efficiency in one maze, is due to a large extent to a few 
subjects, and, consequently, does not indicate that every subject 
in one group is superior in maze learning ability to every sub- 
ject in the other group.

The data in this section have shown that it is possible to divide 
a group of 90 subjects into two groups of 45 subjects each in such 
a way that the difference in the averages of such groups will repre- 
sent a difference in the average maze learning ability of the groups. 
This fact would be of some significance were it desirable for 
some reason to use in an experiment two groups of unequal ability, 
2. What is the possibility of swmming scores in such a way that 
the differences in the several averages of such sums will be chance 
differences and not assignable to any known factor 
This aspect of the problem possesses much more immediate prac-~ 
tical significance than the aspect just discussed. In learning ex- 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
  38 WILLIAM T, HERON 
periments it is practically always necessary to have at least two 
groups of subjects, one the control group, and the other the group 
which is to be submitted to the variable condition. It is essential 
that these two groups should be of the same average ability, i.e., 
if they were tested under the same conditions, they should have 
average scores the difference between which could be accounted 
for by chance. If this is not the case, and the difference in the 
average scores under the same conditions is due to an actual dif- 
ference in ability between the two groups, the results will be af- 
fected in one of the following ways: 
(a) If the variable condition tends to increase the scores 
and it is introduced into the group which possesses the lesser 
ability, the effect of the factor will be exaggerated as judged by 
the results. ! 
(b) If the same variable factor is introduced into the group 
with the greater ability, its effects will be underestimated, or it 
will have no apparent effect whatsoever. 
(ec) The converse of the above statements would be true if the 
factor tended to decrease the scores instead of increasing them. 
(d) If the variable condition had no actual effect whatsoever, 
then it would be judged to be detrimental or beneficial to the 
learning process according to which group it had been given. 
Thus, under any circumstances, unless the groups which are 
used are of equal ability, the results of a learning experiment 
will be misleading, except in the few cases that it is possible 
to use the same group for both test and control purposes. 
In this section the data were treated by the following method. 
Each subject’s number was placed upon a slip and all put into a 
box and thoroughly mixed. They were then drawn out into 
two piles, alternate slips being placed in the same pile. If then 
these two groups were of the same ability, the difference between 
the averages of each should be very small, and the averages 
would inter-change position from maze to maze. If the two 
groups were of unequal ability, the averages would retain their 
same relative positions and the differences between them would 
tend to be larger.

each criterion. Such a procedure would be useless in this in- 
stance, since a chance drawing is just as much chance for one 
criterion as another. In this table, those cases in which the 
averages inter-change positions are italicized. 
These results are not definite in the sense that they show that 
the differences between the groups, obtained in such a manner, are
-P-A-G-E-42
  40 WILLIAM T, HERON 
entirely due to chance, on the one hand, or to differences in maze 
ability on the other. They indicate, rather that both of these 
factors are at work, and apparently which is the more influential 
in any one drawing is a matter of the chance grouping of certain 
cases together. For example,in D 1 the two groups unmistakably 
show a difference in ability so far as errors and trials are concerned, 
and there is only one reversal of the positions of the averages for 
time. If D 2 is considered, however, there are two reversals for 
errors, one for time, and one for:trials. Similar situations can 
be found if the results of the other drawings are examined. This 
would indicate that 45 subjects in a group, selected by chance, are 
not enough to be certain that several such groups are of the same 
ability. 
Such a conclusion, as the above, that 45 subjects in a group are 
not a sufficient number to make sure that several such groups are 
of equal ability, is rather startling when one remembers that in 
most experiments 25 or fewer subjects are used. The situation 
becomes even more interesting when a consideration of all the 
drawings together shows that maze ability is the more important 
factor in the production of the averages of the chance groupings. 
If chance were the only factor acting, we would expect that the 
averages would change position in two-fifths of the cases.® 
On this assumption there should be, for any one criterion, 12 
changes in the positions of the averages when all drawings are 
considered. If the results are examined, however, it will be found 
that chance was able to accomplish 50, 66, and 25 per cent of 
what would be expected of it for errors, time, and trials, respec- 
tively. In other words, chance was able to accomplish, on the 
average, 47 per cent of that which it was anticipated that it 
should do were it the only factor operating. 
However, if chance operated alone, it would be expected to 
do more that simply cause a change in the relative positions of 
the averages. The supposition is that, in all probability, the dif- 
5 Th's number is two-fifths instead of one-half because there are an odd number 
of mazes and in marking the cases which reverse position, I have always marked 
the minority because there is no fixed point of reference. Consequently, the 
greatest number of reversals for any one criterion in any one drawing is 2.
-P-A-G-E-43

ferences between the averages would be less were chance alone 
responsible, than they would if differences in maze ability were 
also responsible. If, then, the average percentage differences 
found between the averages when the group was divided upon the 
basis of the efficiency of the subjects in maze 4 are compared 
with the corresponding values for chance groupings one may ar-~ 
rive at some notion of the relative influence of chance and differ- 
ences in maze learning ability under the two methods of selection. 
This comparison is made in table 16. The values under (A) in

half, found in table 13, by the differences in the averages of the 
two halves which are given under (A) in table 14. The values 
under (B) in table 16 were obtained by averaging the results of 
the six drawings as given in table 15. 
The percentages in table 16 show that in every case the dif- 
ferences between the averages are less when the groups are se- 
lected by chance than when they are selected on the basis of 
efficiency in one maze. In some cases this difference is very 
marked (maze 4 should be excepted since for method A the se- 
lection was made on the basis of the scores in that maze).

The data indicate that chance is playing a much greater part 
in the selection by lot than by that method discussed in the 
former section, and the probability is that if the groups could be 
increased in size still further, chance could be shown to be al- 
most entirely responsible for the differences in the averages as 
judged by the number of times that the averages fail to retain 
their relative positions and by the size of the differences between 
them. 
It was shown, when the groups are divided on the basis of effi- 
ciency in maze 4, that the elimination of the cases which were 
consistent within halves destroyed, to a large extent, the degree 
of certainty with which it could be said that differences in the 
averages of the two groups represented differences in ability 
of those groups. This was interpreted to mean that these par- 
ticular cases were more responsible for such differences than were 
the other cases in the groups. The same problem arises with ref- 
erence to the differences in groups which are selected by chance, 
since we have found that such differences are more to be accounted 
for by actual differences in the ability of the groups than by 
‘chance. 
It is not unreasonable to suppose that the same cases which 
‘were responsible for the constancy in position of the averages 
when the groups were selected upon the basis of efficiency, might 
also be responsible for the similar result when the groups are 
selected by chance. It will be remembered that the number of 
these cases was between 20 and 25, and that the great majority 
of them were either extremely good or extremely poor in the 
majority of the mazes. The remainder of the cases tend, then, 
to be more nearly around the average for the group, i.e., they 
tend to be much more homogeneous. It is obvious, therefore, 
that if such a condition existed to an absolute degree that a chance 
division of the homogeneous group would result in two groups of 
‘equal ability. But, since the cases which are consistent within 
halves tend to be extremes, it would be necessary, in order to 
divide the total group into two groups of equal ability, that there 
‘should be in each of two such sub-groups an equal number of 
each of those subjects who are consistently low and of those who
-P-A-G-E-45
  
  ABILITY VS, CHANCE IN LEARNING SI'YLUS MAZE 43 
are consistently high. Since there are only about 20 to 25 of these 
subjects, approximately equally distributed at each extreme, it 
follows that the probability of getting an equal number of each 
in each group is rather small. _Consequently, the probability 
that the averages will show the influence of chance alone is re- 
duced to just the extent that this smail group of subjects is not 
equally distributed. 
Of course, this reasoning is based on two assumptions: (1) 
that the cases which are consistent within halves are the extreme 
cases, that is they are either very poor or very good in all mazes, 
and (2) that the group which is left when they are removed is 
homogeneous to a great degree. These conditions, in the pres- 
ent data, are not perfectly realized. Therefore, it is necessary 
to remove the cases which are consistent within halves and make

chance drawings of the remaining cases. Since these cases are 
not necessarily the same for all criteria, it is necessary to deal with 
each criterion separately. The results are shown in table 17. 
The results show that the reversals in the positions of the 
averages for errors and time are what would be expected if chance 
were the only factor operating, i.e., they reverse in two-fifths of 
the cases. Trials, however, still show the influence of differences 
in ability between the groups. 
In order to determine if the results for trials would persist 
in other drawings, five more were made with the following results 
in table 18. 
The results in table 18 together with the results for trials in 
table 17 show that there were 6 reversals in the positions of the 
averages of groups selected by chance with the cases consistent. 
 
-P-A-G-E-46

within halves removed. If chance were the sole factor operating 
12 reversals would be expected. Consequently, chance may be 
said to be 50 per cent effective under these conditions as com- 
pared with 23 per cent effectiveness when the consistent cases 
are not removed. Therefore, it may be said that the cases which 
are consistent within halves are responsible to a large extent for 
the failure of the averages to reverse positions in chance drawings, 
as much as they should, were chance the only factor operating.

3. Conclusions 
In this section we have been concerned with the relative 
‘influence of individual ability and chance upon the averages of 
‘groups of scores in maze learning. Our results have shown that 
(1) when a group of 90 subjects is divided into two groups of 45 
subjects each on the basis of the relative efficiency (as judged by 
the size of the scores) of the respective subjects in one maze, 
the difference in the averages of such groups in each of five 
mazes represents a difference in the average maze learning ability 
of the respective groups; and that (2) this average difference 
in maze learning ability is principally due to a few subjects who 
are consistently poor or consistently good as measured by the 
magnitude of their scores in the several mazes. The results 
have further shown that (3) it is impossible (within the limits of 
this experiment) to divide the same group of 90 subjects into 
two groups of 45 subjects each in such a way that the differences 
between the averages of the two groups in each of the five mazes 
can be said to be entirely a chance difference, and (4) that 
 
-P-A-G-E-47

the differences in the averages of two such groups, selected by 
chance, become more nearly chance differences when the cases 
consistent within halves are removed and the chance drawings 
again made. 
Vv. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SCORES IN LEARNING 
THE MAZE AND THE SCORES IN LEARNING THE 
RATIONAL LEARNING PROBLEM 
Considerable interest has been manifested by psychological 
and educational writers as to whether an individual possesses 
a general learning ability or a composite of special abilities. 
The principal discussions have been of a theoretical nature al- 
though some incidental experimental work has been done on the 
problem. The method used is that of correlating the scores in 
two or more types of problem, in an attempt to discover whether 
individuals who are rapid learners in one type of problem are also 
superior in other types. If this is the case, the data would be 
interpreted in favor of a general ability, while if the subjects are 
sometimes superior and sometimes inferior to other members of 
the group, the evidence would be in favor of special abilities. 
In dealing with this problem we have correlated the scores of 
subjects in maze learning with their scores in the Peterson Ra- 
tional Learning Test (described above). Before presenting these 
data a summary will be made of the results of similar® experi- 
ments. 
1. Historical summary 
About 1904, Henderson (5) obtained records for 12 graduate 
students in three tests of memorizing connected material. The 
5 Some of this historical material might have been very well summarized when 
we were dealing with the correlation between mazes, as having greater reference 
to that problem than to the problem which is at present under consideration. 
This is, of course, a matter of opinion. Consequently, the material summarized 
as relevant to the first problem, the correlation of mazes, was limited to other 
investigations dealing also with the correlation of mazes. The other material 
has been summarized under the heading of the present problem, although, in the 
final discussion, some attempt will be made to apply it also to the problem of the 
correlation of mazes.
-P-A-G-E-48
  46 WILLIAM T. HERON 
materials used were passages from (1) ‘‘The History of the Jews,” 
(2) ‘The Dutch Homestead,” (3) “The Stages in the Develop- 
ment of Human Theory.”’ The students were allowed to read 
each passage for three minutes, and then were asked to repro- 
duce as much as possible in writing, paying especial attention to 
the reproduction of the ideas rather than the words. The cor- 
relation of the first reproduction between materials numbers 1 
and 2 was, r = 0.61; between 1 and 3, r = 0.85; and between 2 
and 3,r = 0.50. 
Henderson says that “‘a decided tendency for those who did 
well in one passage to do well in the others is evident. Especially 
is this relation close in the learning of the passages on the Jews 
and Comte’s philosophy.” 
With another group of students (18 undergraduates) to whom 
passages from “‘Cicero” and the ‘History of the Jews” were 
read, there was a correlation between the amounts reproduced of 
r = 0.34. 
Thorndike (6), in 1910, published an article in which he gives 
the correlations (using 38 educated adults for subjects) between 
(a) “the ability to remember a list of twelve words from a single 
hearing, at a rate of approximately one per second, long enough 
to write them immediately at the close of the reading; and (b) 
the same ability in the case of a list of five three-place numbers. 
There were five lists of (a) and five lists of (b).’”’ All the tests 
were given within one hour. 
The results show that the obtained ‘‘raw’’ correlation between 
(a) and (b) is0.44 +1. ‘The mixture of the two sexes and the 
testing of the two traits in the same hour tend to make this higher 
than the relation between the general ability to remember word 
lists and the general ability to remember three-place number 
lists. On the other hand, there is the attenuation due to 
variation, in both (a) and (b), of the results from five tests 
from the person’s true ability. I estimate that correction for 
all three would result in a correlation of about 0.54. The rela- 
tion between (a) and memory of lists of 12 single digits was 
found to be 0.6, eight independent records of each being used. 
Correction for attenuation raises this to 0.7-. So, until more 
 
-P-A-G-E-49
  
  ABILITY VS. CHANCE IN LEARNING STYLUS MAZE 47 
adequate measures are made, we may accept as the most likely 
fact that, in such a test of brief retention, a variation in the con- 
tent from words to numbers reduces the correlation from 1 to 
about §. Even if the reduction should prove to be only 3, the 
fact would still be very strong evidence of the dependence of 
efficiency of memory upon content and of the specialization of 
mental functions in general.”’ 
Thorndike (7) in a later article (1916) presents data which 
“give some information concerning the relation of ability to im- 
prove in one mental function to ability to improve in other func- 
tions.” He used 15 subjects and the correlations which he ob- 
2 
tained by the formula r = 2 sin (>) where p = 1 — Alri 6 n(n?—1) 
Gain in canceling with gain in adding r= 0.10 
Gain in canceling with gain in mental multiplication r = 0.29 
Gain in canceling with gain in typewriting ~ r= 0.10 
Gain in adding with gain in mental multiplication r= 0.25 
Gain in adding with gain in typewriting r= 0.12 
Gain in mental multiplication with gain in typewriting r = 0.07 
Probable error in all cases = 0.15 
Thorndike estimated that if these correlations were corrected 
for attenuation, ete., that they would be raised about 20 per cent. 
He also found correlations between the gain in canceling 2’s and 
the gain in canceling 3’s of 0.77; between the gain in addition 
(trial 1) and gain in addition (trial 2) of 0.81; between gain in type- 
writing (first period) and typewriting (second period) of 0.80. 
A study from the University of Wisconsin by Faye Bennett (8) 
in 1916 gives correlations for two professors, four graduate stu- 
dents, and three seniors between the learning of different sorts 
of material. She used two classes of material, connected and 
disconnected; and two methods of presentation, auditory and 
visual. The subjects were ranked for each method of presenta- 
tion according to the average number of repetitions required by 
each to learn four series of ten units of the different types of 
material. 
In allowing for errors, one repetition was added for each substitution, 
omission or addition; one-half repetition was added for each trans- 
position; and one-half repetition for each error of one letter in nouns 
and syllables, and of one digit in the numbers. 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
48 WILLIAM T, HERON 
The connected material was made up of prose, consisting of 
one description, one narration, and one exposition for each method 
of presentation. The disconnected material consisted of syl- 
lables and numbers. 
In the visual tests the observers read and re-read the selection 
silently and by the whole method, until it was memorized so that 
it could be reproduced in writing. The time required was taken 
by the experimenter while the number of repetitions was recorded 
by the observer.

In auditory presentation, the material was read to the sub- 
ject until he said that he could reproduce it. This led to a great 
deal of under-learning. The score then was the time required 
to learn plus ten seconds for each error. 
The correlations (rank method) which she obtained, of interest 
to us, are as follows in table 19. 
Pyle (9) in 1921 in his book the ‘‘Psychology of Learning”’ 
gives the average inter-correlations for six different learning prob- 
lems. ‘These problems were of the following nature: 
   
-P-A-G-E-51
  ABILITY VS. CHANCE IN LEARNING STYLUS MAZE 49 
1. Card sorting. This consisted in distributing 150 numbered 
cards into trays numbered to correspond. There were 30 trays, five 
in a row and six rows so that five cards belonged to each tray. One 
experiment consisted of sorting the 150 cards into the appropriate 
trays. : 
2. Marble sorting. 96 marbles of different colors and sizes had to 
be distributed into six different receiving boxes by means of a compli- 
cated machine demanding the use of both hands and feet. 
8. Digit substitution. In this problem digits were to be substituted 
for symbols, and vice versa. 
4. Alphabet substitution. This test consisted in converting the 
alphabet into arbitrary symbols, 
5. Nonsense syllables. A list of ten nonsense syllables was presented 
visually at the rate of one per second. And the presentation was con- 
tinued until the subject could correctly reproduce the list in writing. 
6. Mirror writing. The subject must write, using a mirror reflected 
stimulus, a copy which would appear normal in the mirror. 
Most of the experiments were repeated with several different groups 
of subjects. There were usually about 75 in a group. The learning 
capacity of each student for each type of problem was determined, 
and all possible correlations were computed, 41 in all. The results 
are very constant. Only the averages are given here. 
Only one correlation could be computed with mirror writing, and 
that was with learning nonsense syllables. Between these two tests, 
the correlation was 0.505, and is included in the averages as given for 
nonsense syllables. 
Lyon (10) has also contributed some results to this inquiry. 
He says, : 
An individual who is a quick learner of one sort of material tends, 
upon the whole to be a quick learner of other sorts also. 
He used prose, poetry, digits, nonsense syllables, and words, 
and found that, 
Some individuals stand consistently high and some consistently low. 
There is, however, a good deal of shifting from one material to another, 
and this shifting finds expression in the coefficient of correlation between 
the ranks in the two materials. As computed by the rank-difference 
method, the average correlation between the speed of learning any 
two sorts of materials is, for this group of subjects, 0.51.  
-P-A-G-E-52
    
50 WILLIAM T. HERON 
The group in question was comprised of 25 subjects. For a 
group of 17 other subjects he found a correlation of 0.42 
I have taken the rankings which he gives of 24 subjects in the 
time required to learn different materials, and have computed 
inter-correlations by the Spearman Foot-Rule method. These 
coefficients were then converted into the Pearson r by means of 
the table given in Rugg (11), in order to determine how nearly 
the average correlation which Lyon gives represents what may 
be expected to exist between any two kinds of material. These 
ote are given in table 21. 
Somewhat lower correlations were found between other kinds 
of learning problems by Haught (12). He gives the inter-cor- 
relations of four different learning problems. These problems 
are (1) the rational learning problem, as used in the pres-

  ent experiment, (2) the rational learning problem as modified by 
Haught,| (3) checker puzzle, and (4) the Tait labyrinth puzzle. 
For a detailed description of these problems, the reader is referred 
to Haught’s monograph. They are, however, “of such a nature 
that the subject may solve them either by the hit-and-miss method 
or by a reflective method.” Haught gives the inter-correlations 
of these problems when all the various criteria recorded in the 
progress of the learning of the problem (such as trials, errors, and 
time) are equally combined. These correlations (r coefficients) 
are shown in table 22. 
Very little work along this line has been done with animal sub- 
jects. ‘Three coefficients, however, may be given. ‘The first of 
these was found by Bagg (4) whose work has already been men- 
tioned in another connection. He gave 93 mice 17 trials in the 
mazeand some time later 25 trials in the multiple choice apparatus. 
   
-P-A-G-E-53
  ABILITY VS. CHANCE IN LEARNING STYLUS MAZE 51 
He correlated the time for the last 15 trials in the maze with the 
time for the last 23 trials in the multiple choice problem and 
found a coefficient of 0.11. 
The present writer (13) ran 22 white rats one trial per day for 
six day's in the problem box. . They were then allowed to rest for 
sixty days, at the end of which time they were run for six days in the 
maze, one trial per day. The correlation between the total time 
in the problem box and the total time in the maze was 0.006 
(rank method), and that between total time in the problem box 
and distance (errors) in the maze was 0.093. 
It is difficult to make any general statement with reference to 
the above experiments. In several cases, for instance the work 
by Henderson (5), Thorndike (7), Bennett (8), and Heron (13), 
TABLE 22 
Inter-correlations of different problems (from Haught); number of cases = 74

the number of subjects was too small to warrant any generaliza- 
tions. It seems evident that the degree of correlation is largely 
a function of the problematic situation involved, though the fact 
that there are only two negative correlations (and those with audi- 
tory presentation) in all those listed above would point to the 
conclusion that there is some general factor influencing all of 
them, ‘There is considerable variability in the correlations, even 
in the few cases where the same material was used. By convert- 
ing Bennett’s correlations into r coefficients, it was found that 
her correlations between digits and nonsense syllables became 
0.43 as opposed to Lyon’s for the same material of 0.59. On the 
other hand, Bennett’s correlation for nonsense syllables and prose 
_ is 0.80, while Lyon’s is only 0.70. However, these two experi- 
menters agree in that both got lower correlations with digits and 
syllables, than with prose and syllables. If a sufficient number of 
such relationships could be determined, then it would be possible to
-P-A-G-E-54
  52 
make an nalysis of the causes of the correlations. WILLIAM T. HERON 
For example, 
in the above case, it would appear, a priori, that there is a closer 
relation between the materials in the case of syllables and prose, 
than in the case of digits and prose. Whether such factors are 
effective and the kind or degree of similarity necessary to cause 
a high correlation, can only be found by consistent work on the 
  
  
  
    
  
    
  
  relation between scores in different problems, when enough cases 
are used to justify correlations. In the present experiment, we 
have sought to further this inquiry by correlating the standings 
of 60 subjects in maze learning with their scores in a rational 
learning test.

2. Results of present experiment 
The data in this section support the conclusions, (1) that there 
is pract 
learning cally no relationship between maze learning and the 
of the rational learning problem; (2) that there is a 
relatively high degree of relationship between the scores in the 
two rati

nd each of the two rational learning problems. They are the correlations between the five original 
   
-P-A-G-E-55
  ABILITY VS. CHANCE IN LEARNING STYLUS MAZE 53 
A glance at the table will preclude the necessity for discussion. 
The only evidence of relationship, as shown by the correlations, 
are those between R.L. 2 and maze 4 for time, between R.L. 2 
and maze 5 for time, and between R.L. 1 and maze 4 for trials, 
R.L.1 and maze 5 for time, and between R.L. 1 and maze, 1 for time. 
Since there is no consistency and since these four coefficients just 
barely conform to the criterion of reliability, little evidence is 
forthcoming that there is any relationship whatsoever between the 
records of subjects in individual mazes and the rational learning 
problems. 
It was thought possible that the coefficients might be raised 
by summing the scores in the mazes and correlating them with 
the sum of the scores in the rational learning tests. This was 
done with the results that for time the correlation was 0.36 + 0.08, 
for trials 0.20 + 0.08, and for errors 0.01 + 0.08. Thus, it is seen 
that this method of treatment does not appreciably change the 
magnitude of the correlations. The only possible exception is 
that of time, but still there is, even there, no very great rela- 
tionship shown. 
An investigation of the relationship between the two rational 
learning tests showed that the correlations between those two 
tests were 0.58 + 0.06 for time, 0.48 + 0.06 for trials, and for errors 
0.57 + 0.06. This shows that there is a real relationship between 
the records. in these two tests which is consistent for all criteria. 
This fact, together with the fact that mazes 4 and 5 also cor- 
related, and the further fact that there was no correlation between 
these mazes and the rational learning tests, indicates that Thorn- 
dike’s contention that there are specializations of mental func- 
tions is justified by the present experiment. This follows as a 
logical conclusion from the consideration of these three sets of 
correlations, because the correlation between the mazes indi- 
cates that there is a function common to them, and the correla- 
tion between the rational learning tests indicates a function, like- 
wise, common to them. Now, if these functions were the same, 
it follows with a very high degree of probability that the correla- 
tion between the two sorts of problem should also be only slightly 
less than 0.50. It is, of course, true that chance would tend to

reduce such a correlation, but if the abilities are the same, it 
should he reduce it an appreciable degree, since it has already 
reduced the correlation within each separate problem. 
VI. GENERAL DISCUSSION 
Probably the most striking fact presented in this paper is 
that certain mazes correlate relatively much higher among them- 
selves than do others. I believe that an explanation of this fact 
may be found in the patterns of the mazes which have been used. 
This is the proposition that I wish to state in the succeeding 
paragraphs. 
The maze is spoken of as a ‘trial and error’ problem. The term 
‘trial and error,’ however, is very general and it only acquires 
significance if the problem to which it is applied is analyzed 
further. When a subject is placed in the maze situation for the 
first time, it is necessary for him to adopt this method, because 
there is no other possibility of solution available. The ‘trial and 
error’ method may, however, bring about the learning in one of 
two ways: (1) the subject may arrive at a generalization by use of 
which he can run the maze without further difficulty, and with- 
out accurate knowledge of the details of the pattern, or (2) he 
may learn in detail the pattern of the maze, knowing just which 
way to turn at each stage of the passage through the apparatus 
and in this way finally arrive without error at his objective. 
Which method is adopted will depend, in a large measure, 
upon the pattern of the maze which is given to the subject. If 
the reader will turn back to the drawings of the mazes used in 
this investigation, he will find that it is possible to formulate a 
generalization which, if consistently followed, will enable him to 
run any one of the first three mazes without any previous know]- 
edge of them whatsoever. This generalization may be stated 
as follows: always go as far as possible and press firmly against 
each succeeding side which interrupts progress, allowing your 
hand to follow its own own course under these conditions. 
It was obvious to the experimenter that practically every sub- 
ject made this generalization, either consciously or unconsciously, 
at some time during the progress of learning these mazes. In     
  
   
-P-A-G-E-57

many cases, after having learned maze 2, this method would be 
consciously realized by the subject and he would comment upon 
it. In such.event, he was cautioned, of course, against telling 
any one else. It is apparent that once the generalization comes, 
there is no further learning involved in running the maze. No 
subject, however, could tell definitely whether this method would 
work in any maze which he had just started until he had experi- 
mented with it. In some cases the subject would assume that 
the method would be successful and use it upon the first trial, 
consequently he would perform four perfect trials (the criterion 
of mastery) without making any errors. This was especially 
true in maze 2 and happened occasionally in maze 3. The less 
frequent occurrence of these errorless records in maze 3 is prob- 
ably due, judging from comments of the subjects, to the difficulty 
in maintaining the ‘‘sense of direction” in such an intricate series 
of turns. 
I believe that this peculiarity in the patterns of the mazes 
(especially maze 2, since it has also relatively few turns) is suffi- 
cient to account for the low correlations of mazes 1, 2, and 3 as 
compared with mazes 4 and 5 which the subjects could not run 
by rule, for it is well known that, among a group of individuals 
who are on about the same plane with respect to intelligence and 
. relevant past experience, the time required to make a generali- 
zation is largely a matter of chance. 
Likewise, it is probably true that no ‘trial and error’ problem, 
even though it is not capable of being solved by a generalization, 
will ever correlate very highly with other problems of similar kind 
or itself. In fact the term ‘trial and error’ itself indicates that 
there are a number of alternatives, one of which is right and the 
others wrong, and that the individual must discover by chance 
which is the correct one. 
Furthermore, it may be said that no learning problem is likely 
to correlate as closely with itself or similar problems as do many 
tests, such as the tapping or Porteus maze tests which are simply 
indicators of a given ability, rather than measures which include 
progressive acquisition of methods directed towards a definite 
criterion of mastery.
-P-A-G-E-58
56 WILLIAM T. HERON 
The reason for this is that all learning problems necessarily 
involve a choice and whenever choice is possible then chance 
may operate. Of course, in some learning problems such as 
memorizing a list of words, the choice is not as great as in other 
problems such as the maze. I have already indicated that in 
the learning process there are two different types of activity com- 
bined in a more or less equal proportion. These are the processes 
of exploration and fixation. The relative proportion of these 
two processes will vary with the problem to be learned. Those 
problems in which there is a relatively large amount of exploration 
as compared to fixation are the most subject to chance influence 
and, consequently, the scores of individuals in such problems are 
of little value in predicting their scores in some other problem. 
A typical example of this sort of problem in maze 2. The pre- 
liminary exploration process in such a problem results in an im- 
mediate solution which requires but little effort to fixate. A 
problem at the other extreme is the problem used in the ordinary 
memory experiments (e.g., learning lists of words). In such a 
problem the principal process involved is one of fixation and the 
range of exploration is relatively very limited with the result 
that scores in such problems have greater predictive value. 
Some experimental evidence for such a conclusion may be found 
in the fact that the correlations between problems of memoriza- . 
tion, such as those given in table 21, are relatively much higher 
than the correlations between mazes. On the other hand, there 
are problems which stand midway between these two extremes 
in the relative amount of exploration and fixation required to 
learn them. Examples of such problemsare those used by Haught 
(see table 22). With these the correlations tend to be lower than 
for those problems in which fixation is the primary element. Of 
course, it is understood that the opportunity for the entrance of 
chance factors is not due entirely to the nature of the problem, 
but a large number of such factors may be the consequence of 
extraneous influences, such as noise, ete. They are partly due 
also to the subjective conditions of the subject, the method of 
taking data, ete. 
 
-P-A-G-E-59
    ABILITY VS. CHANCE IN LEARNING STYLUS MAZE 57 
Reasoning of this sort must, however, be done, for the most 
part, on an a priori basis, because, as yet, enough consistent work 
has not been done on the subject so that one may speak from the 
empirical results. It seems possible however, that different learn- 
ing problems could be ranked on the basis of the relative influence 
of chance and individual ability upon their solution. Until 
that is done we cannot say empirically that any particular prob- 
lem, for instance the maze, is any more or less subject to chance 
than are other learning problems. 
VII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 
The argument and results of this investigation may be sum- 
marized under three headings. 
A. The relative influence of differences in ability and chance upon 
the individual scores in maze learning 
The method of attack upon this problem was the correlation 
of the scores made in learning or relearning a number of mazes. 
The supposition was made that the values of the correlations so 
obtained would show the relative influence of chance and indi- 
vidual ability upon scores in maze learning, since chance, acting 
alone, would, tend to make such correlations approach zero, while 
individual ability, acting alone, would tend to produce perfect 
positive correlations. 
A summary of the correlations which were obtained follows: 
The average of the inter-correlations of all five mazes (all criteria 
included) is 0.32, and the range is from 0.02 to 0.65. The average 
inter-correlations of the scores made in relearning three mazes 
is 0.17, and the range is from 0.00 to 0.25. These correlations were 
interpreted to mean: 
1. That chance and individual ability are both influential in 
the production of scores in maze learning. 
2. That these two factors vary with the pattern of the mazes in 
the respective parts which they play in the determination of the 
scores in maze learning. This follows from the fact that mazes 4 
and 5 invariably correlate much more highly than do any of the 
other variables. The correlation between the scores in the learn-
-P-A-G-E-60
58 WILLIAM T, HERON 
  ing and relearning of maze 4 was also relatively high (maze 5 
was not relearned), while maze 2 tended to correlate relatively 
low with other mazes and the correlation for the scores made in 
learning and relearning it was practically 0.00. 
3. That in no case is individual ability very much more influ- 
ential than chance. This is indicated by the fact that only a few 
of the correlations are much higher than 0.50. 
4, That in some cases chance is very markedly more influen- 
tial than individual ability. This is indicated by the largenumber 
of correlations which are very low some of which are even less 
than 4 times their probable errors. 
In order to find if each individual’s score was affected to the 
same degree by chance, the average and maximum variation of the 
ranks of each subject’s scores in the five mazes were determined. 
The supposition was made that the greater the variation of the 
individual’s ranks from maze to maze the more is chance operating 
in the production of his scores. These values were found to vary 
greatly for different individuals, although the great majority of the 
group ranged around a central point between the extremes. The 
range of individual differences in susceptibility to chance influences 
can be indicated by the range of average variability. This was 
from 3.5 to 41.8 with the average at 24.2. 
A further effort was made to determine whether there is any 
relationship between efficiency in maze learning and variability. 
This was done by comparing the individual’s average rank in 
learning five mazes with his average variability. No definite re- 
lationship was found except at the extremes where it would be 
expected upon a priori grounds. 
B. The relative influence of differences in individual ability and 
chance upon group averages of scores in mage learning 
This problem is an outgrowth of the results obtained by cor- 
relating scores in maze learning. Since such results show that 
chance and individual ability have a reciprocal influence upon 
such scores, it is necessary that one should determine how these 
two factors will interact when scores are combined into group 
averages.

    ABILITY VS. CHANCE IN LEARNING STYLUS MAZE 59 
Two methods of attack were used upon this problem, (a) the 
total group of 90 subjects was divided into smaller groups on the 
basis of the subjects’ efficiency in maze 4, and the average scores 
of such groups found for all five mazes; and, (b) the total group 
of 90 subjects was divided into smaller groups by chance selections, 
and the averages of such groups found for each maze. 
By means of method (a), an effort was made to find two or 
more groups of unequal ability, as indicated by the average scores 
of such groups retaining their same relative positions for all five 
mazes. The results show that (1) when the total of 90 subjects 
is divided into groups of 45 each that the two groups so obtained 
are of unequal ability when such inequality is judged on the basis 
of the above criterion. 
It was further shown that (2) the average difference in maze 
ability of the groups is due, for the most part, to a limited number 
of subjects within each group. These subjects were found to be 
those who remained consistently in one or the other of the halves 
in all five mazes, since when their records were removed the aver- 
ages show the influence of individual ability to a much lesser 
extent. 
By means of method (b) an affort was made to obtain two or 
more groups of the same ability, as indicated by the averages of 
such groups fluctuating in their relative positions from maze to 
maze. The results show that, within the limits of this experiment, 
it was not possible to find groups which could be said definitely 
to be of the same ability. However, when the. total of 90 sub- 
jects was divided into groups of 45 each, the two groups thus ob- 
tained were much more nearly of the same ability than when the 
same group of 90 subjects was divided into two groups of 45 sub- 
jects each by method (a). 
This difference in the averages of groups selected by chance was 
also found to be due to some extent to the same cases which were 
responsible for it when the group was divided by method (a).

C. The relationship between the scores in learning the maze and the 
scores in learning the rational learning problem 
This problem is distinct from those which have been under 
consideration and is concerned with the question of the kind and 
degree of relationship between the ability to learn the maze and 
the ability to learn a more reflective type of problem. The 
method of attack was again that of correlation of the scores in 
the two types of problem. The results show that the relationship 
between the abilities required to learn the two problems is very 
small but in the majority of cases it is positive. This is indicated 
by the fact that the highest correlation obtained is 0.30, and that 
all coefficients which are four times the probable error or more 
(of which there are five) are positive.

Personnel Research Series 
This series has been created by Personnel 
Research Federation to carry into the field 
of book report and monograph publication 
the type of service already established in 
the periodical field by the Journal of Per- 
sonnel Research. 
The present volume constitutes the first 
number of the Personnel Research Series, 
which has been created to facilitate the 
publication of the work of members of Per- 
sonnel Research Federation, and of others 
contributing to the study of personne! 
problems. As such it is a pleasure to call 
attention to some of its special character- 
istics; the fact that it advances definite in- 
formation in one field of personnel activity, 
the fact that it illustrates the development 
of a method and extends its use, the fact 
that it presents its procedure, methods and 
conclusions through the medium of a 
straight-forward and readable exposition, 
the fact that it will be welcomed with inter- est not only by the technicians in personnel 
research but by an important industrial 
group as well, and the fact that it is the 
result of a codperative effort on the part of 
an academic and an_ industrial group. 
These are features which it is hoped will be 
matieinel in subsequent numbers of the 
eries. 
The Series will be issued in a form that 
will be convenient as to size, legible as to 
type and reasonable as to prices, the inten- 
tion being to give each volume the widest 
possible circulation, both among those 
interested in research work and those en- 
gaged in practical personnel administra- 
tion. While edited under the auspices of 
Personnel Research Federation, the Series 
will not be an integral part of the Journal. 
Each number of the Series will be issued 
separately. Probably the differences in 
length and printing cost will make neces- 
sary varying prices.

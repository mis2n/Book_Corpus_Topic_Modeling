PREFACE TO NINTL. «DITION. 
In making revisions for this edition, the importance 
of school diet, so perplexing to many mothers, has 
made it necessary for me to add a chapter upon School 
Luncheons to the suggestions in previous issues of 
this work. The present public discussion concerning 
the value of the pasteurization of milk has also caused 
special revision of the statements made herein concern- 
ing the use of this method as a safeguard only. The 
absolute necessity always exists for public provision 
for a pure, clean, milk supply as the one thing 
requisite. Pasteurization is regarded by the most 
eminent members of the medical profession as a safe- 
guard only when used under special conditions. This 
fact has been emphasized in this book since its first pub- 
lication. I desire to acknowledge the courtesy of the 
John C. Winston Company in granting the privilege 
of using material from one of my other publications 
concerning School Diet, which has received the ap- 
proval of such experts as Roland Godfrey Freeman, 
M.D., of New York City, and Samuel Train Dutton, 
of the Horace Mann School, Columbia University.

PREFACE TO EIGHTH EDITION. 
In making revision, later authorities have been con- 
sulted, eminent physicians conferred with, and the 
home difficulties of mothers and nurses still more 
steadfastly kept in view in the hope of further aid- 
ing those who need to be relieved specifically in the 
regulation of dietetic practice. 
The welcome accorded the book, both here and 
abroad, by the medical press as well as by the pro- 
fession, and the urgent request of my publishers, led 
me to make this revision and all changes have been 
carefully made with due consideration for professional 
requirements.

PREFACE, 
Tue substance of a number of papers that have 
appeared during the last two years in various journals * 
has been embodied in this book upon the request of 
members of the medical profession, mothers, and others 
interested in children. ‘These articles have been care- 
fully revised, and much additional material has been 
used, All statements made are based upon facts ac- 
cepted very generally by scientists and physicians both 
here and abroad, where the greatest amount of original 
research has been made, and authority for these facts, 
when not credited in the text, may be found in the 
works of the following writers, which have been studied 
very carefully, in connection with much other reading 
relative to the subject: “ Pediatrics,’ T. M. Rotch, 
M.D.; “Infant Diet” and “Therapeutics of Infancy 
and Childhood,” A. Jacobi, M.D.; “Food in Health 
and Disease,” J. Burney Yeo, M.D., F.R.C.P.; “ Diet 
after Weaning” (Keating’s “ Cyclopedia”), by Samuel 
S. Adams, A.M., M.D.; “The Mother’s Work with 
Sick Children,” Professor J. B. Fonssagrives; “ Prac- 
tical Dietetics,” W. Gilman Thompson, M.D. 
The purpose of this book is to offer in a practical 
form a few suggestions concerning the application of

the principles of dietetics to feeding in the nursery and 
throughout the period of childhood. 
It is also hoped that the book will meet the require- 
ments of practitioners, who rarely have the time to 
direct in detail the management of children’s diet. It 
is not the intention of the author to advise where a phy- 
sician is needed, but rather to suggest to the mother or 
nurse when he should be sent for, and how he may be 
aided in his efforts by the exercise of intelligence and 
judgment in the selection and preparation of foods 
indicated for various ages and varying conditions of 
illness and convalescence. Owing to differences of 
temperament and constitution, each case needs indi- 
vidualization: hence, when there is the least doubt, 
even in conditions of health, a physician should be 
consulted without delay. In the hope, therefore, that 
when a physician is available the counsel given will 
he explicitly followed, this little book is earnestly com- 
mended to mothers and those in charge of children, as 
well as to physicians who may wish to be relieved of 
the tediousness of making specific the general laws 
regulating dietetic practice. 
The author is deeply indebted to T. M. Rotch, M.D., 
Boston, for the use of his book “Pediatrics,” and to 
Samuel 8. Adams, M.D., Washington, Leroy M. Yale, 
M.D., New York, and Edgar Dubs Shimer, Ph.D., 
Professor of Psychology, New York University, for 
suggestions and assistance in revision of manuscript 
and proof, ¢

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS 
TO PHYSICIANS, 
The feeding of children is the foundation of citizen- 
ship. Unless this be done in accordance with their 
needs the whole super-structure of preventive medicine 
cannot stand. It has been proven that the most 
important formative period of the human being is the 
first three months of life. It should be obvious that 
the delicate embryonal structures of infants, which 
later acquire amazing tolerance to hurtful agencies, 
demand the utmost solicitude while beginning to 
adjust themselves to external influences. 
Of all these influences none compare in potentiality 
to the food supply. The structures of all infantile 
organs, especially those concerned in Digestion and 
Elaboration, are aggregations of cells newly emerging 
from the simplest of primitive forms. The nervous 
control mechanisms are barely able to functionate, with 
little capacity to provide resistance to irritants other 
than normal. They are capable of dealing admirably 
with suitable materials ; but if those presented are unfit 
the strain put upon the whole organism is out of pro- 
portion to the powers of resistance and something 
fails, gives way. If these strains are too severe or 
prolonged, damage thereupon ensues either to structure 
or physiologic habit, which can never be repaired. 
The individual is thereby rendered incapable of that 
', marvellous conservation and attunement to opposition

which otherwise is acquired, and sinks to a lower plane 
of vitality than that of which the inherent powers are 
capable. 
The substitute feeding of infants has been placed. 
_ upon a firm foundation by Jacobi, Rotch, Chapin, Holt 
: and others, constituting an epoch in the history of medi- 
+ eal research. No single clinical principle compares with 
* this in importance to the human race; it is a triumph 
of practical adaptation of physiologic teachings. Never- 
theless it is still far from perfect, and moreover it was 
foreshadowed by the researches of others, among whom 
Mrs. Hogan is one of the earliest and most conspicuous 
students. Fifteen years ago she recognized the need 
for accurate substitute feeding, made a study of scien- 
tific laws governing this procedure, and offered prac- 
tical suggestions, the nature of which, in most essential 
particulars, is the rule of conduct to-day. 
Rotch was the prophet of accurate percentage feed- 
ing, and others elaborated or modified his teachings. 
The belated consciousness of many who saw the 
urgency of this measure and had partly grasped the 
principles were thus forcefully impressed. It proved a 
beacon light, a great stimulus whereby many lives, and 
more constitutions, were saved. The most valuable 
result of all this is that fuller attention is now given to 
the accurate adjustments of individual food demand to 
supply. The way to solve the problems of nature is 
to get the actual facts, in all their bearings, determine 
the principle on which they stand, and then teach, as is 
done in “ How to Feed Children,” the simplest means 
of accomplishment. 
Nearly all forms of animal life require for their sus~

tenance due proportions of fats, proteids, carbohydrates, 
inorganic salts, mineral matter and water. These are 
derived from plants or from other animals ; it remains to 
‘determine the form and sources from which they can 
best be supplied. A young animal passing from the 
single initial cell through the various stages of embry- 
onal, infantile and adult life exhibits wide varieties of 
organic capacities and adaptabilities. For each one the 
demands for chemical substances are similar, yet it makes 
a vast difference in what form these are met. We need 
to know as much as possible of the governing biologie 
principles and variants, much more than we now do; 
but so far our one safe guide is experience, modified by 
wisdom, and illumined by science, but not wholly guided 
by scientific findings because they are not yet perfected, 
nor will they soon be. In this respect Mrs, Hogan’s 
book has received the support of the medical profession ; 
and twenty leading medical journals endorse its use 
amongst physicians, mothers, teachers of domestic ser- 
vice, and nurses, as the safest book of its kind to 
recommend. Mrs. Hogan fully recognizes the physi- 
cian’s prerogative and responsibility and all her teaching 
is complementary to his work. 
The only safe perfect food supply for the young is 
the mother’s milk; whoever else—parent, physician, 
nurse or meddlesome bungler—attempts to suggest 
otherwise commits a grievous sin. Unfortunately it 
is the innocent helpless babe who suffers, not the repre- 
hensible adult, influenced by ignorance or malice. Sub- 
stitute feeding, now developing into a fairly safe 
measure, is by no means an unmixed blessing. It 
serves as an excuse for many mothers to neglect that

highest of her duties which ought to be cherished as 
the loftiest privilege. When circumstances make 
this normal food supply impossible then we must do 
the best we can, but the problem is always a complex 
one fraught with hourly perils. In this connection a 
_ faithful physician will most appreciate the help offered. 
. the profession in this modest little book, so eminently 
’ fitted to meet the requirements of practitioners as well 
as mothers. 
After the digestive tract has passed through the evo- 
lutionary period of adaptation to milk, or its equiva- 
lents, it gradually acquires capabilities of utilizing 
foods similar in character to that of the parents. So 
much attention has been centered of late on the per- 
fecting of close imitations of human milk that the 
period of transition to later digestive conditions is 
often neglected. It is this problem with which the 
present book is designed chiefly to deal. Whereas the 
earlier weeks of the infant’s life are of the most fate- 
ful significance, mistakes made here are totally irre- 
coverable and only partly remediable, yet the errors of 
the later years are only second in importance. The 
child is not a small adult, it still retains embryonal 
features compelling the utmost care while passing 
through phases of inherited or temporary incapacity. 
Whether or not a child shall become a vigorous 
adult depends almost solely upon its nutrition in the 
earlier months of its life. Other factors do enter into 
the problem, but digestion and assimilation stand 
immeasurably at the head. If the food be lacking in 
certain essential particulars, digestion cannot take place 
without discomfort or pain, and thereby otherwise per- 
es

fect hygienic conditions are made of small efficacy. 
Hence the exceedingly frail and vulnerable life is 
assailed in such fashion that small chance remains for 
it to acquire the necessary vitality or resistance to enable 
it to withstand the onslaughts of disease to which it is 
unceasingly exposed from birth to exit. The child 
must be so fed as not only to escape the immediate dis- 
comforts of acute indigestion, diarrhceas, etc., but the 
remote dangers of nutritional diseases, rickets, maras- 
mus, scurvy and the degenerative disorders. 
The digestive powers of the infant are designed chiefly 
to accept animal food. It is not till later, perhaps the 
fourth or sixth month, that starches can be assimilated, 
nor till the slow gradual development of the various 
tissues and organs (so much less rapid in the human 
young than in animals), that the higher degrees of dif- 
ferentiation and elaboration are attained which distin- 
guishes man. The use of predigested starches as dilu- 
ents in substitute feeding, as recommended by Chapin, 
is another matter ; it serves a valuable purpose. 
The process of the eruption of the teeth is the guide 
in great measure of this progress. It is obvious that 
food which requires minute mechanical subdivision 
should not be used until there is provided the necessary 
tearing and grinding machinery. Wherefore it is plain 
that only fluids are suitable for the infant till the 
growth of the teeth is well established. The size of 
the stomach at birth is so small that the amount of 
food taken at each feeding must be in proportion. If 
too much is given at a time to overfill this organ the 
excess is either regurgitated in a natural unloading, or 
it remains to vex and distress the intestines, producing
-P-A-G-E-16
6 INTRODUCTORY REMARKS TO PHYSICIANS. 
more or less discomfort or illness. Again, in infants, 
so simple is the character of the mucous surfaces of 
the stomach and intestines, and their glandular secre- 
tions, that only the least complex and best adapted food 
can be safely or continuously accepted. 
If other and less suitable substances are ingested, it 
iis a question rather as to how little disturbance they 
may cause, than whether hurtfulness may be escaped 
or no, Starvation does not mean that a child fails to 
get enough food, but the right kind of food, in the 
right condition, and in proper amounts, and at suit- 
able intervals. An infant, or even an older child, 
would starve in the abundance of a well-filled pro- 
vision shop, fully stocked for the feasting season of 
Christmas, if left to its own devices and selection. 
Many children, and even youths, do die from this pre- 
_Cise cause in families abundantly able and willing to 
provide plentifally of all the essential articles of diet, 
but who, through ignorance or carelessness, fail to put 
this food into such form as fits it to their wants, 
Especially is this true-if the digestive capacity becomes 
impaired through whatsoever causes. There are all 
the chemical elements needed for human food in the 
ordinary dinner of a healthy laboring man, but it 
would be cruel to limit his baby to a happy-go-lucky 
selection from its component parts. Yet, in great 
measure, this is constantly done. When those of us 
who have opportunity to see just how this dinner is 
prepared, how pitiably ignorant the ordinary house- 
wife is revealed to be in the rudiments of the cooking 
art, the only wonder is that so many babies survive to 
become in turn bread-winners like unto their fathers,
-P-A-G-E-17
INTRODUCTORY REMARKS TO PHYSICIANS. 7 
and to resemble them in size, shape and digestive capa- 
city. 
I am often led to the conclusion that one of the most 
constant sources of infant mortality is the imbecile 
pride, so common among fathers of high or low 
degree, in the capacity of their children to “eat any- 
thing on the table,” just as they do themselves. In our 
everyday practice, we physicians meet with this as a 
cause of, at the least computation, one-half of the 
cases of illness among little children. In the nursery, 
influenced by chance counsel of ignorant, unthinking 
or conceited folk, are made, of much the same mater- 
ials, fature heroes or whining invalids. 
One point of greatest importance, constantly neglec- 
ted, should never be lost sight of. The sine qua non 
of digestive competence, in young or old, is deliberation 
in the act of eating. Unless full insalivation is 
secured, along with complete mastication of the solid 
matter, there must follow various forms and degrees 
of digestive derangement. Children, especially older 
ones, frequently bolt their food, thus laying the foun- 
dation of endless future discomforts. Habits formed 
in the plastic stage are despotic; they safeguard or 
they endanger health. In the nursery these habits 
must be initiated aright. Milk is a solid in the sto- 
mach and should be eaten, not drunk. It is best to teach 
the older child to take milk from a spoon and slowly. 
The use of nipples with a wide opening permitting a 
flood to rush into the stomach is a fertile cause of 
dyspepsias. Impatient nurses or mothers cause more 
troubles than the whole profession of medicine in a 
life time can cure.

8 INTRODUCTORY REMARKS TO PHYSICIANS. 
Mrs. Hogan’s book has passed through: many edi- 
tions, each one exposed to the scrutiny of the reviewers, 
who have found little to criticise and much to 
commend. Especially have the medical journals com- 
mended it, individual physicians have lauded it highly, 
in the press and in private letters to the author. The 
chief features are sufficient scientific accuracy and emi- 
nent practicability and, above all, adaptability to cur- 
rent needs. It is more detailed than a physician would 
be likely to write, hence it is better adapted for the 
mother and none the less to be welcomed by the physi- 
cian; most of us know too little of how to choose and 
prepare foods for children, and few how to arrange a 
daily or weekly menu for those well or ailing.

HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
CHAPTER IL 
Reasons why Mothers should study Dietetics. 
THE study of dietetics as applied to the nursery 
and the period of childhood is constantly brought to 
the notice of mothers. A practical application of 
theory to individual needs is of great importance 
whatever system of feeding is decided upon. The 
usual hap-hazard method is founded on ignorance.—* 
Some knowledge of the physiology of digestion is 
necessary to select the foods that are suitable for the 
requirements of infants and growing children. All 
parents should understand that the rearing of a child 
is fraught with great responsibility, which it is crim- 
_ inal to avoid, It is too frequently the custom among 
° Bdilts-to- think that what is. provided 1 ‘for “themselves 
in the way of food.may--be.given. with impunity - to 
_children. They forget that the food an adult can re- 
ceive and. assimilate does harm to the tender organs 
ofa child,—organs that depend. very largely for their 
development upon a proper selection and administra- 
tion of assimilable foods. _Carelessness and ignorance 
at this period of life.are quickly followed by perni- 
Clous results. The treatment of almost all diseases of 
the digestive organs in children requires the special

study of foods and of hygiene, and many of them 
may be avoided by care in this direction. Any mother 
who will study the nature of food products, whether 
nitrogenous, carbonaceous, or mineral, their propore 
tions of waste and water, those needed to build tissue, 
furnish heat, purify the blood, etc., will comprehend , 
at once the value of dietetic knowledge in the selection 
and preparation of wholesome food for her family._: 
This knowledge is the foundation of sound practical 
dietetics (Burnet), and the subject is one of universal 
importance. A nourishing diet must be supplied 
  “every set of muscles into. play ; want of sulficient exer- 
cise diminishes tissue-change. During this early period 
of life larger supplies of certain food elements are 
required than in adult life, when physical growth has 
ceased and bodily activity has grown less, It must 
also be understood that under various conditions in 
the life of the same child different foods and. quantities 
will be required.—The diet must be adapted to the 
power ‘of the constitution at the time, and it must be 
of the highest nutritive value possible for present 
(digestive power. If the child’s digestion is normal, 
and its life an active and out-of-door one, it can as- 
similate more and stronger food than if, from variations 
”’ in climate and other causes, it leads a more quiet life ; 
and if for any reason its digestion is not up to its 
normal standard, consideration must be given particu- 
larly to quantity. It must be remembered that through 
repair eating is intended to balance, not to increase,
-P-A-G-E-21

the waste caused by the constant action and change 
going on in the organs. This waste, if not fully coun- 
terbalanced, will soon cause suffering and illness, but 
the mistake so constantly met with of overfeeding 
must have the right ratio of protein, fats, and carbo- 
“hydrates ; enough proteids (eggs, milk, meat, etc.) must 
‘other | constituents of food to give energy, to keep the 
‘body warm and to enable it to do its work. The 
amount of nutrition required in every instance must 
be carefully considered. One of the most important 
reasons for this is that energy must not be wasted in 
getting rid of superfluous material, as organic disease 
may result. A little food thoroughly digested is far 
better than much that is half digested. ~ 
It is always necessary to understand how to supply | 
as nearly as possible the same materials that the body | 
is regularly losing, as, for instance, when we give heat- ; 
forming food in cold weather and liquid in hot weather. 
Drink constitutes food as well as what we eat. As each 
nutritive ingredient serves its own peculiar purpose, it 
can readily be seen why it is necessary for a mother to 
understand something of the elements of food and their 
-petion, 
She should also be able to detect immediate needs 
in individual cases, as, on account of proximity, she is 
generally the only one who notices the daily variations 
in conditions requiring daily modifications of diet. 
Whilst 2 mother need not actually cook the food re- 
quired, she should know just what to select under 
certain conditions, and exactly how to have it prepared, “eo
-P-A-G-E-22
12 HOW T0 FEED CHILDREN. 
Further, she should not only be able to note by results 
that her directions have been carried out, but also be 
willing, if necessary, to see to it personally that this is 
done. A little supervision, judiciously applied, will 
frequently prevent. difficulties that are likely to occur 
as a result of carelessness upon the part of servants. 
Q She should understand the changes needed in health, 
illness, and intermediary stages. In illness, this knowl- 
edge would allow her ably to supplement the efforts of 
the physician, and in cases of slight indisposition she 
would frequently seize the opportunity for overcoming 
ailments which, uncared for, might prove scrious. For 
instance, if she recognized the fact that the eliminative 
processes were hampered, she would cut down albu- 
minoids: thus, in cases of constipation the supply 
of fruit, vegetables, cereals, etc., would be relatively 
greater in menus than that of milk, eggs, meat, etc. 
(proteids). Again, as the preparation, intervals, and 
amounts in feeding children are of equal importance, 
she would know that with ailing children she must 
feed more frequently and less at a time; that the 
food must be more daintily prepared and be more as- 
similable than that required in health ; and she would, 
consequently, pay particular attention to these require- 
ments. In cases of illness she would realize that 
success in treatment depends very largely upon the 
trouble taken in the combination and preparation of 
the foods that are allowable, so as to give as varied a 
diet as the necessary limitations will permit. Tem- 
perament would be considered, and tastes and likings 
consulted, all of which are of great importance in the 
digestion of food. Naturally following as a result of
-P-A-G-E-23
WHY MOTHERS SHOULD STUDY DIETETICS. 18 
such study, the fact would be discovered that mora 
liquid food should be used than is « 
solid. The giving of water is one 0 
portant, features in.infant feeding. Miuuy wove 
require it, and it is healthful at all times, unless in 
rare stages of illness, when it might be forbidden by 
medical authority. It is not unusual to deprive in- 
fants almost entirely of water because they drink milk. 
The fact is overlooked that milk, though a liquid out 
of the body, becomes in the stomach a solid food 
containing all the nutriment required for an infant’s 
normal growth. Irregular action of natural laws is 
not infrequently a result of this deprivation, and can 
easily be corrected by the use of what appears to many 
to be an excess of water. 
Among the uneducated, strong in the old theory of 
teething being the necessary cause, it is a very common 
custom to look tolerantly upon serious infantile ail- 
ments. “Errors in diet, and consequent disorders of 
digestion, which frequently give rise to violent con- 
vulsions in infancy, would occur less frequently if,” as 
has been aptly said by a physician, “for ‘teething’ we 
would read ‘stomach and feeding, and if we would 
always consider whether these are at fault, we might, 
although proving disagreeable and troublesome at 
times to the mothers and nurses, do more good to the 
suffering infants.” 
If food is not such as the digestion can master, it is 
‘useless and can only do harm. Not being turned to 
proper account, the blood receives no new supply, and 
is impoverished ; there is no nourishment given for de- 
velopment of body, and inherited tendencies to various 
2

diseases are encouraged by those whose duty it is to 
provide food of nutritious quality and to see that it 
is carefully administered. Many of the diseases to 
which children are liable would disappear under strict 
supervision of hygiene and diet, especially the various 
intestinal disorders, including many resultant throat, 
-eatarrhal, and nervous troubles. Nature resents care- 
‘lessness, and is relentless in her punishments. What 
the doctor calls cholera infantum, rickets, or marasmus, 
etc., and the mother is inclined to consider a dispensa- 
tion of Providence, is only too frequently the direct 
result, of violations of the most common laws of 
domestic science. 
This problem is always before the physician. Food 
and hygiene have entered so largely into the study of 
medicine that preventive medicine has become one of 
the features of the day, and departments for this study 
have been, and are being, opened in the most promi- 
nent universities in all countries. The truly success- 
fol physician is he who carefully studies the chemical 
properties of different foods and their application, and 
who not only understands but makes use of this knowl- 
edge in his practice. Much of his effort may be wasted, 
however, owing to lack of knowledge upon the part of 
those directly interested. ) Directions may be given with 
preston, hut the wnttifaed mother or nurse will fre- 
/ quently err by not carrying out instructions exactly 
as given, and thus often retard the recovery and pos- 
sibly endanger the life of the patient. 
~~The'whole study of nursery dietetics appears to be 
a vast one, yet it resolves itself into a few simple and 
generally acknowledged facts. For an infant, whatever

is given as a substitute must resemble its natural food 
as closely as possible. That this can be done has been 
shown by expert analyses, and this fact is conceded by 
all leading specialists upon the subject. 
A legal enactment in France prohibits the giving of 
any form of solid food to infants under one year of 
age without the authority of a prescription from a 
qualified medical man. ‘The employment of the rub- 
ber tube for nursing-bottles is also forbidden, as it is 
almost impossible to keep it clean. The passage of 
this law is due in great measure to the efforts of the 
Society for the Protection of Children, of which Dr. 
Rouchard is founder. The United States Department 
of Agriculture at Washington has also taken up the 
matter of infant foods in connection with reports upon 
tuberculosis. A circular is issued by this department, 
giving simple directions for the treatment by heat 
necessary to make milk a safe food for infants. The 
establishment in Boston, and later in New York, 
Philadelphia, and elsewhere, of the Walker-Gordon 
Milk Laboratories, opened a new field in the province 
of infant feeding, and results, as stated elsewhere, show -: 
conclusively the advantages that have been gained thus 
far. These and similar movements are important and 
practical, and they should fully demonstrate to the 
thinking mother the necessity for her study in this 
direction. 
Following infancy comes the more difficult period 
of childhood, although not usually considered so, when 
necessary supplies of nutriment must be furnished to 
repair the constant waste caused by the active growth 
of the child. It frequently happens that a plump,
-P-A-G-E-26

vigorous-looking infant develops into a thin, unhealthy- 
looking child. / It is at this time that the constituents 
of various foods for practical results should be thor- 
oughly understood, the amounts necessary for various 
periods should be comprehended, and methods of ad- 
ministration and preparation should be closely studied. 
No amount of general knowledge will be of service at 
this period ; special study is required. The laws of 
heat and change of tissue by applied heat must be 
learned. The proper proportion of albuminoids, salts, 
starches, and sugar must be considered under different 
conditions. The relation of fat to food as an aid to 
digestion, under what conditions to use it, and in what 
form and quantity to apply it, whether as cream or 
butter, olive or cod-liver oil, must all be carefully 
studied. In selecting the food for a growing child 
special diet lists must be consulted, and they must 
be reliable. It is in this connection principally that’ 
. the mother will find of value her knowledge of the 
chemistry of foods, the science that tells us what things 
are made of, and how their elements combine with 
others to produce certain fixed results. Knowing the 
chemical composition: of foods, she can use her knowl- 
edge to provide palatable dishes with no loss of nutri- 
ment. Indeed, if she possesses elementary knowledge 
only, she can economize time, labor, and money. 
Constant suggestion in this field may prove of un- 
told value when sufficiently practical to guide the 
mother in her selection of menus from lists of foods 
that have been dietetically considered and given as 
suitable for the requirements of a child in average 
health and condition. Foods that are especially suita-

ble for various forms of illness should be included in 
these lists, and recipes allowed should be only those 
that have been tried and found advisable, considered 
in every way, from a practical as well as a dietetic 
point of view. Such specific knowledge, if thoroughly 
comprehended and followed with intelligence, would 
aid physicians materially in their efforts to lay for 
children a firm foundation for the future. my 
Following the period of childhood comes the time 
for the study of estimating correct quantities and 
proper selections of food to be used in regulating the 
diet suited to the individual needs of girls and boys 
approaching maturity, the excesses to be avoided by ; 
those of sedentary habits, and questions of similar .’ 
import. “ 
Relative to this whole subject Sir Henry Thomp- 
son, a noted English physician, and an authority upon 
dietetics, says, “I have come to the conclusion that 
more than half the disease which embitters the middle 
and latter half of life is due to avoidable errors in 
diet (to which might be added, ‘more particularly in 
early years’), ... and that more mischief in the 
form of actual disease, of impaired vigor, and of 
shortened life accrues to civilized man. . . from 
erroneous habits of eating than from the habitual use 
of alcoholic drink, considerable as I know that evil 
to be.” 
General knowledge is of very little use in this study 
beyond directing attention to the need existing for 
special knowledge. What appears to be one of the 
most practical phases of this many-sided subject is 
that this special knowledge must be supplied to

mothers by scientists, by physicians, and by those 
among the laity who are sufficiently interested in the 
subject to assist by giving data secured through per- 
sonal experience. The science of household affairs 
must be understood if reform is to be looked for. 
Endowments must be made to enable scientists to 
make researches of the highest order. Simplified re- 
sults may then be given to the public in such a manner 
that they will be assimilable and readily comprehended 
by the average intellect. Schools, public and private, 
should not overlook the importance of this study. 
Then all mothers and home-makers in the land, our 
indirect nation-makers, will easily come to understand 
the underlying principles involved, and will apply 
this knowledge in such a way as to benefit all who 
are dependent upon their efforts. Herbert Spencer 
says, “Perhaps nothing will so much hasten the time 
when body and mind will both be adequately cared 
for as a diffusion of the belief that the preservation 
of health is a duty. Few seem conscious that there 
is such a thing as physical morality. Meu’s habitual 
words and acts imply that they are at liberty to treat 
their bodies as they please. The fact is, all breaches 
of the law of health are physical sins. When this is 
generally seen, then, and perhaps not till then, will the 
physical training of the young receive all the attention 
it deserves,”

Infant Feeding. 
Natural Feeding—Food for Mothers—Wet-Nurse—Substitute Feeding 
—Modification of Milk—Purpose of Milk Laboratories—Weaning. 
T. M. Rorcu, M.D., of Boston, Professor of Dis- 
eases of Children at Harvard University and author 
of “ Pediatrics,” says, “Just as the highest aim of 
medical art should be directed to the province of pre- 
ventive medicine, so the highest and most practical 
branch of preventive medicine should consist of the 
study of the best means for starting young human 
beings in life... . It isa proper or and improper 
nutriment which makes or mars the perfect’ 
coming generation. . . . We should be guide 
nature has taught us throughout many ages _ _._., 
ing the form of nutriment suitable for an especial 
period of life.” Because of Dr. Rotch’s high stand- 
ing and vast experience, his statements command rec- 
ognition everywhere, and, with his permission, many 
of his most recently expressed views are embodied in 
the present chapter. 
The superiority of human milk to all other kinds of 
infant food is universally acknowledged. Dr. Rotch 
has divided the nutrition of young human heings into 
three distinct nutritive periods, corresponding to the 
stages of their development. The first period consists 
of the first ten or twelve months of life, and it is at this 
19
-P-A-G-E-30
20 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
time that human milk must be considered. Mother’s 
milk, when of good quality, which must be determined 
by results, is conceded by all to be the most desirable 
food for infants, The younger the infant the more 
important the breast nursing, as it is extremely difficult 
"; to prepare a food that will agree at this age. Every 
effort should be made to nurse a child for at least three 
or four months. A large number of infant, 
prived unnecessarily of their natural food. A 
edge increases this will, undoubtedly, occur tess tre— 
quently. Mothers do not err usually from lack of 
feeling, but from want of knowledge as to ways and. 
means. In no respect is there seen more lamentable 
ignorance, and maybe carelessness, than in this direc- 
tion. Mothers rarely know the conditions requisite for 
the satisfactory nursing of a child. To nurse a child 
 hormally, a mother should be strong and healthy, of 
yan even, happy temperament, desirous of nursing her 
infant, and she should have time to devote herself to 
vacthis special duty during the whole period of her lac- 
tation, She should have a sufficient supply of millx, 
and should be willing to regulate her diet, her exer— 
cise, and her sleep according to the rules which will 
best fit her for her task. These may be said to be 
the ideal conditions for the nursing of an infant. It 
is true that women who are far from vigorous nurse 
their infants with seemingly good results, and that a 
frail, delicate-looking mother may have an abundant supply of good milk. These are exceptions, however, 
which make the principles just stated all the more 
true. Emotional mothers do not make good nurses, With few exceptions, the mothers who have uncon

trollable temperaments, who are unhappy, who are 
unwilling to nurse their infants, who are hurried in 
the details of their life, who are irregular in their 
periods of rest and in their diet and exercise, are 
unfit to act as the source of food-supply for their in 
fants. Even if their milk happens to be sufficient i: 
quantity, it will probably be so changeable in quality 
as to be a source of discomfort, and even of danger, 
rather than the best nutriment for their offspring. The 
influence of emotion on mother’s milk is very great: 
in some cases it acts as a direct poison. It is far better 
for such mothers not to attempt to nurse if they cannot 
regulate their lives, but to adopt some other method of 
feeding. It is of still greater importance that mothers 
who aré suffering from some chronic disease, or one 
which their infants may directly inherit, should 
up all thought of nursing. A nursing diet shoul: 
include too much meat and solid food ; an abutiuaue 
light diet should be given at first,—milk gruels, soups, 
vegetables, bread and butter, and after the first week 
a small amount of meat once a day. Increase the 
diet with exercise, using plain but nutritious foods, 
taking regular meals, and frequently additional ones 
of milk, cocoa, ete. Use no stimulants ; malt extracts 
are useful; drink milk at night. The food of a 
nursing woman is closely connected with that of her 
infant. Idiosyncrasies must be looked for, and if cer- 
tain articles disagree with certain women, and con- 
sequently with their children, they should be omitted 
from their dietaries, but they need not be forbidden to 
all women on this account. , 
“For the average woman, a plain mixed diet, with 
vo
-P-A-G-E-32
22 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
a moderate excess of fluids and proteids over what she 
is normally accustomed to, will, as a rule, give the best 
results.” (Rotch.) 
Exercise is important in regulating the constituents 
of human milk. It is to be taken according to the 
strength of the woman in question. A walk of one 
or two miles daily, or an equal amount of similar 
exertion, is necessary in almost all instances to reduce 
the proteids in human milk to the proper proportion. 
. Mothers frequently wonder why their children have 
colic, when the reason is to be found in their own 
sedentary lives. This is very well illustrated in a case 
cited by Dr. Rotch, of an infant that was being nursed. 
by its mother, who was healthy, and who had an 
abundance of breast-milk. The infant during the 
first two months of its life nursed well, throve, and. 
:-was perfectly quiescent in its daily life. When it was 
‘three months old the mother was very much worried. 
_. by some trivial family matters, and did not take much 
‘lexercise. The infant now began to have colic, and, 
although it gained in weight, it was very restless, and. 
cried continuously. The indications for treatment, as 
shown by an analysis of the mother’s milk, were to 
lessen the amount of mental disturbance in the mothexr 
and-to make her exercise more. The mother followed 
directions, and the infant improved. After a few 
days the unfavorable symptoms returned, and it was 
found that the mother had not been exercising, and was 
again mentally disturbed. Suitably modified labo 
ratory milk, containing a very much smaller percent— 
age of proteids than the analysis of the mother’s milk 
showed, was then used, and the child digested the food .
-P-A-G-E-33
INFANT FEEDING. 23 
perfectly, had no colic, and gained in weight. Later, 
a change to a wet-nurse was made, with ensuing diffi- 
culty, as her milk had too high a percentage of proteids. 
The child became ill, lost weight, and its bowels were 
affected. At last the mother decided to return to the 
use of the laboratory milk, which was given low 
in proteids ; in twenty-four hours improvement was 
marked, and from that time on gain was steadily made. 
This is only one of the many interesting accounts of 
the work being done by physicians with the aid of 
milk laboratories. 
Mother’s milk may vary in quality and quantityé 
Frequent analyses should be made; this can be done 
by any physician, approximately, by the use of the 
method devised by Dr. Holt. The apparatus is inex- 
pensive and of assistance to those physicians who are 
endeavoring to solve the problem of infant feeding, 
but who may be beyond the reach of laboratories and 
other opportunities afforded in large cities. It is of the 
utmost importance for any nursing mother to have an 
analysis made of her milk when the child is thriving, 
that in the event of her sudden death, illness, or ab- 
sence the same constituents of food may be provided, 
thus avoiding all risk of illness to the child from a 
change to an unsuitable substitute food. It should be .~” 
the duty of every family physician to see that this is done. Lb 
Human milk may be considered as representing’ 
a combination of foods. Experience shows that the 
digestive capabilities of infants differ just as do those 
of adults, and that nature provides a number of varie- 
ties of good human milk adapted to the various idio- 
syncrasies of infants.
-P-A-G-E-34
24 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
“Young animals at birth begin to receive their 
nourishment immediately, and a corresponding increase 
in their weight takes place from the first day of life. 
The human infant, in like manner, should begin with 
/ its nursing early, getting what it can from the breast 
until the full supply of milk has come. In this way 
" it will not be likely to have a large initial loss of weight 
to regain. . . . Every hour, every day, is of the utmost 
importance in the early days of life, and, provided it 
can be done without detriment to the condition of the 
mother, the sooner the infant is put to the breast the 
better. If, during the first two or three days of life, 
it is restless and evidently hungry, on account of the 
\ mother’svinability to supply milk, one to two drachms 
\ of a five per cent. milk-sugar solution, made by dis- 
4, solving milk-sugar in sterilized water, should be given 
“\.at intervals of two or three hours.” If the mother’s 
milk is delayed still longer, something additional must 
be given to the infant, and if the food cannot be ob~ 
tained from a milk laboratory, the proportions for 
home preparation should: be exactly specified by the 
physician in charge. 
The intervals constitute a very important part of 
the mavagement of breast feeding where the quantity 
i CASt itself. should be defi- 
nitely stated to the mother at different times through- 
out the nursing period, and should be adhered to. 
The table given by Dr. Rotch as an average rule, 
with the caution that the intervals of feeding be made 
to correspond to the stage of development of the indi-~ 
vidual, is as follows:

Note that night feedings are omitted at two to 
four months. The mother may thus have continu- 
ous sleep at night and get the rest necessary for condi- 
tions requiring it. Too frequent nursing renders milk; 
too solid, lessens the water, and gives the child colic ; 
too long intervals make the milk too watery to give 
nutrition. The importance of regularity at proper 
intervals cannot be overestimated for the comfort alike 
of mother and child. An infant should nurse about ~~~ 
fifteen minutes; this will be found to be usually long 
enough to empty one breast, which should be sufficient 
for one feeding. A period of nursing longer than the 
usual fifteen or twenty minutes before the child is 
satisfied should make us suspicious that the milk is 
lacking in quantity, which can be determined by 
weighing the child before and after nursing, at dif- 
ferent nursings in the day, before reaching conclu- 
sions. Increase of weight is the best evidence as to 
nutrition. Dr. Edward P. Davis says a child may 
gain by proper food from a half-ounce to an ounce 
daily for the first four or five months, and half the 
amount for the rest of the year. The appearance of 
B 3

the stool is also an evidence of nutrition. In an in- 
fant it should be half solid, bright yellow, and free 
from partially digested milk. 
In certain cases the mother’s nipple is so small or 
depressed as to give trouble in nursing. Nipple shields 
will sometimes be of assistance. In cases of extreme 
pain a little patience for a few days will bridge the 
difficulty and prevent the loss of the child’s greatest 
blessing. Bathing with cold water before and after 
nursing keeps the tissues in healthy condition. In 
cases where the child cannot obtain its food through a 
shield or from the breast from lack of suction power, 
the breast-pump becomes of value. The practical 
deductions to be drawn from known experiments 
demonstrate that in cases of illness of the mother or 
unavoidable absence from an infant the breast-pump 
may be used regularly to relieve the breast of the 
mother until such time as she may resume nursing, 
whilst the babe may be fed according to the analysis 
which the physician should have made beforehand and 
readiness for reference under the possibility

8 aust be used very carefully. TLaxative med~ 
vill frequently affect a child, and they should 
«.wayo be given with caution. Dr. Rotch speaks of 
one iustance of a mother’s drinking porter every day, 
which caused her nursing child to vomit for weeks. 
She stopped taking it, and the vomiting of the infant 
ceased. 
‘The return of menstruation does not necessarily in- 
dicate that there should be cessation of nursing. The only disturbance which is likely to arise is a slight

attack of indigestion, which will in all probability dis- 
appear under normal conditions in a day or two. If 
this is not the case and the milk appears to disturb the 
child’s nutrition continuously, a physician should de- 
Ne whether weaning is necessary. 
Pregnancy is not compatible with nursing; hence 
weaning is imperative, but if a child is delicate or ill, 
it must not be done suddenly. Five or six weeks 
should be taken to do it, using modified milk prepared 
according to an analysis of the mother’s milk that 
should have been made before the disturbance arose. 
SA If at any time the mother’s milk seems insufficient, 
it may be supplemented with properly modified milk 
by one or two feedings a day at any age, from six 
weeks up, it necessary. So long as a child gains in 
weight, nursing may be continued up to eight or ten 
months, according to the season of the year; if, how- 
ever, the child does not gain, substitute feeding may be 
used at any age, but the substitute food must be made 
to resemble the mother’s milk as closely as possible. 
If teething is delayed, it is an evidence of poor breast- 
milk, and substitute feeding should then be begun. A 
well-nourished child should grow about eight inches 
the first year (or nearly three-quarters of an inch 
every month) and four inches the second year (not 
quite half an inch a month). An infant should 
double its weight in six months, and treble it in a year. 
It should be weighed and measured monthly. If it 
does not increase at the rate of about one pound a 
month the first year, and about twelve ounces a month - 
the second, it is advisable to see to its nutrition, which 
will, in all probability, be found to be at fault. A

28 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
nurse should cease nursing if these conditions are not 
present. Premature children should increase in the 
same ratio. 
The employment of a wet-nurse requires careful 
consideration, and should be done under a physician’s 
advice only. All the points which have been referred 
to for successful maternal nursing are of equal signifi- 
cance in the case of a wet-nurse. For many reasons, 
such as expense, difficulty in securing one whose milk 
will agree, hereditary taint, ungovernable temper, etc., 
this method of feeding is usually out of the question ; 
hence indirect substitute feeding must be instituted in 
the majority of cases. If a wet-nurse is employed, 
her diet and habit of life should remain as nearly as 
~-e*hle like what she has been accustomed to. 
der all circumstances, even if a mother is healthy 
he milk good, by the end of the first year wean- 
aould have been accomplished. Unmodified cow’s 
and starch in some form are much better adapted 
to the child at this time, and should be substituted for 
mother’s milk. If a child has been properly weaned, 
m easily digest them at this age. The presence of 
or eight incisor teeth allows a change to be made ~+ she food, and the use of starchy foods follows, but it is usual for children to be unable to digest these 
foods to any extent until the last two or three months 
ofthe” first year.~'The period of nursing may be shortened or lengthened, by a month or two, according to the season of the year, the coming of the teeth, or the condition of the child from illness or convalescence. 
Under such circumstances it may be wiser to feed the infant from the breast during summer, and to wean it

in cool weather, before or after the hot season, accord~ 
ing to the individual case. It is also preferable to “~~ 
wean when the child is not cutting teeth, as disturb- 
ances may arise. Sudden weaning should never occur ; 
sufficient time should be taken, and the food substi- 
tuted must be gradually given. If home modification 
of milk is depended upon, give one bottle in place of a 
nursing for a few days, watching the child carefully to 
see if the new food agrees; then two bottle feedings, 
replacing two nursings, preferably one in the morn- 
ing and one in the afternoon; after a few days three; 
and so on until every meal is given from the bottle. a 
If the milk is properly modified, weaning should be “~~ 
a very simple matter in ordinary cases. Dr. Rotch 
says the method he finds safest and best is used in 
connection with the milk laboratory. If an infant 
is thriving upon its mother’s milk, he has the milk 
analyzed, and sends for the same percentage of the 
elements in the substitute food to be used. After 
using this for a few days, if he finds the milk agree- 
ing with the infant, he changes the constituents grad- 
ually, with the object of gradually combining these 
percentages in such a way as to correspond to the 
percentages of the elements of unmodified cow’s milk. 
He shows how this is easily and precisely accomplished, 
and fully explains the use of milk laboratories where 
such exact methods are followed. At the tenth or 
eleventh month, before the breast-milk has been en- 
tirely withdrawn, starch in some form, as advised by 
the physician, should be added to the milk, and, if it 
agrees, the breast can be altogether replaced by substi- 
tute feeding.

Idiosyncrasies must be looked for in infants as well 
as in older children, and a physician’s advice is always 
necessary when deciding what method of feeding is to 
be adopted. It does not frequently occur to mothers, 
when a reliable physician is not available, that opinions 
can be secured by letter, from undoubted authorities, 
upon simple points which do not involve complieca- 
tions, yet which are sufficiently disturbing to one who 
is conscientious and who may not want to decide upon 
them for herself. With the great facilities offered 
by mail and express, it is entirely practicable to feed 
a child artificially, if in average health, according to 
the laboratory methods, even at a distance. Many 
persons who realize the necessity for skill when thus 
situated would undoubtedly be willing, were the method 
indicated, to secure freedom from responsibility in the 
ecision of important matters where it is possible. 
[ap-hazard infant feeding by mothers and nurses 
aould be entirely done away with; they must learn 
that they are ordinarily in no position to decide for 
themselves upon so important a question, and they 
should gladly follow the lead of physicians who are 
making constant efforts to put these matters on a safe 
and scientific basis. If those in charge of children 
can ever be brought to understand how little they know of the subject, there will be a great step in advance made in infant feeding, for not only will the safest methods be discovered, but they will be followed, which is not the case as matters stand to-day. Children, especially infants, are fed in the most careless manner, unless, perhaps, in some exceptional instances where a careful mother may rely upon the opinion of one

who knows, instead of presuming to know it all her- 
self, 
Too much stress cannot be laid upon the necessity 
in infant feeding for mothers to consult physicians in 
regard to substitute feeding, and all important changes 
to be made, and equally upon a strict following to the 
letter of all directions given, not relying too implicitly 
upon others for supervision where personal attention 
is necessary. If this be done, the physician will be 
aided, not hindered, as he now so frequently is, in his 
efforts to reduce infant mortality and increase the 
strength of those who survive. 
/ Proprietary artificial foods are entirely unnecessary 
when cow’s milk and cereals may, with the requisite 
knowledge, be prepared at home. They are a useless 
expense for older children, unsuitable for infants, and 
altogether the weight of opinion is against their use. 
If in weaning a child the laboratory method or home 
modification cannot be depended upon (for unavoidable 
reasons) the Fairchild process of peptonization should 
be carefully tried at any age or season, one bottle 
taking the place of a nursing at first, two in a few 
days, and soon. In eases where a physician or labo- 
ratory methods are not available, this process should 
always be used for infants hand-fed from the first be-

upon casual observation. The true test is shown in its 
resistance to the various forms of disease sg- generally 
supposed to be children’s necessary siete, Many 
of them result from carelessness,-aid are called chil- 
dren’s diseases only because at this period of slight 
resistance the greatest amount of ignorance and care- 
lessness is usually displayed, with consequent disas- 
ter to the little ones. As the knowledge of hygiene 
and dietetics in the nursery becomes more general, 
the infant’s chances of life will outweigh those of 
death. 
‘Some modification of cow’s milk is necessary for 
substitute feeding. It is the universal source of sup- 
ply for this purpose, and, as Dr. Rotch says, the 
various foods used are merely adjuvants of cow’s 
milk, which does away with much misapprehension 
concerning the apparently successful results of in- 
numerable foods. What he says further upon this 
subject might be studied with profit by every one 
interested in the welfare of children : 
“Tt would seem hardly necessary to suggest that 
the proper authority for establishing rules for substi- 
tute feeding should emanate from the medical pro- 
fession, and not from non-medical capitalists. Yet, 
when we study the history of artificial feeding as it is 
represented all over the world, the position which the 
family physician occupies, in comparison with that of 
the venders of the numberless patent and proprietary 
artificial foods administered by the nurses, is a humili- 
ating one, and should no longer be tolerated. 
“If we are abreast of the times, if we but recognize 
and do justice to the work which has lately been done

34 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
by our own profession, we surely will not hesitate to 
telegate to oblivion the statements of the food proprie- 
tors, which on box and can, on bottle and printed cireu- 
lar, attempt to stem the slow but inevitably progressing 
wave of scientific investigation. 
“It may be well to bear in mind that the attempts 
which in the past have been made to manufacture 
cheap foods have been markedly failures. We must 
first, regardless of expense, learn to produce by modi- 
fication a perfected substitute food, and not endanger 
the success of our undertaking by allowing the mer- 
cantile side of the question to cripple us in the use of 
costly methods, which, however, we know to be the 
best. We should, in fact, remember that the human 
milk, which we are endeavoring to copy, far from 
being a cheap product, is a very expensive one. 
“My own opinion in regard to patent foods, as a 
whole, is that they must necessarily be unreliable. 
They are thrown on a market where the competition is 
extreme, and when once they have been advertised into 
public notice I cannot but feel that irregularities and 
changes—slight, perhaps, in the eyes of the makers—— 
may unintentionally creep in and carry their composi-~ 
tion still further from that of the standard, human mill. 
“Analyses show that there ‘is a lack of uniformity 
in these foods from year to year, and that original 
claims are apparently forgotten or allowed to give 
way to cheaper production. In fact, as my experience 
in the feeding of infants increases, and as I examine 
year by year the effects of the different foods on in- 
fants, I am strongly impressed with the belief that with our present physiological, chemical, and clinical
-P-A-G-E-51
Z INFANT FEEDING. 35 
knowledge all the patent foods are entirely unneces- 
sary. The claims made for them are not supported by 
_ intelligent and unprejudiced investigation.’ Those who 
manufacture them are not in a position to judge cor- 
rectly concerning them. The merit at times of their 
apparent success does not belong to them, but to ac- 
companying circumstances. They do great harm by 
impressing upon the public the false idea that a cheap, 
easily prepared food is for the good of the infant and 
is better than anything that can be procured elsewhere. 
They vary too greatly in their analyses to keep even 
within the acknowledged varying limits of human 
milk. It is therefore high time for physicians to ap- 
preciate exactly how inefficient in themselves and how 
misleading in their claims are these artificial foods, 
and also in what a false position, as the protector and 
adviser to the public, our profession is placed whenever 
it lends itself to even a toleration of their use. I 
speak of them here simply because there is no doubt 
that they are kept in the market by the physician 
rather than by the manufacturer. The latter is only 
doing what any capitalist interested in a business ven- 
ture would do. The former, it seems to me, is, per- 
haps unintentionally, aiding the business interests of 
others at the expense of his own future reputation as a 
scientist. It makes little difference to physicians as to 
what is claimed for these foods when they are placed 
in the market. It makes a great difference what the 
mixture contains when given by the mother to the 
infant according to the directions on the label. For 
instance, a food may show by its published and certi- 
fied analysis a fair percentage of fat or sugar, and yet
-P-A-G-E-52
36 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
this same food when diluted for the infant’s feeding 
may have these constituents reduced far below the 
reasonable limits of nutrition.” Dr. Jacobi calls con- 
densed milk a beneficent makeshift for those who 
cannot get good milk. 
/Yt is not generally known that every year in the 
nited States alone thousands of children die for want 
of care in the preparation and administration of their 
food. (Until within the past few years very little 
attention was given to the purity of milk or to the 
ssibility of keeping it sweet for any length of time? 
nfected milk is one of the chief sources of con- 
tagion in consumption, scarlet fever, diphtheria, and 
kindred diseases. The proper care of milk demands 
purity of source, cleanliness in handling, and quick 
and careful transportation.~; Failing these, the appli- 
~~eation’ of heat is thé only safeguard left to the mother 
to protect her child. Statistics show that in hospitals 
where this method has been introduced the death-rate 
of children, particularly of infants, has wonderfully 
decreased. This is not surprising when one hears that 
a single microbe, like the hay bacillus—found in all 
stables—is so prolific that at the end of twenty-four 
hours its descendants will be more than ten billions in 
number. This fact alone shows one immense ad- 
vantage to be gained by the application of a sufficient 
degree of heat to kill all dangerous germs. The fact 
is generally conceded that pure milk will prevent 
much infant disease and mortality, and bacteriologists 
have fully demonstrated the necessity for this process 
by showing that milk is rarely pure. The milk which 
is now received from the farms connected with the   
-P-A-G-E-53
INFANT FEEDING. 37 
milk laboratories is practically so free from bacteria 
that it need not be pasteurized in the winter months ; 
and often, also, in the summer it will remain fresh, 
except in exceptionally warm weather, or when it has 
to be transported a long distance (Rotch). 
Dr. Chapin says that in six hundred infants whose 
cases were studied, nearly all the troubles were acquired 
and not hereditary. “ While a tendency to constitu- 
tional disease may be inherited, it is the bad surround- 
ings and the faulty conditions of life that powerfully 
predispose to illness,” the chief sources of difficulty 
being poverty and ignorance. He says the waste of 
child-life in densely populated centres, especially in 
New York, is enormous. In the year 1893 the bodies 
of three thousand and forty-two children under five 
years of age were received at the morgue, and nearly 
all were buried in Potter’s Field, killed by poverty 
and ignorance, want of proper diet and care, In 
France, out of two hundred and fifty thousand infants 
that die annually, one hundred thousand might be 
saved by careful nursing, says M. Rouchard, President 
of the Society for the Protection of Children, This 
knowledge caused the passage of the bill forbidding 
the use of solid food for infants under one year of 
age, unless advised by a physician. A few facts like 
these will show to the educated and thoughtful woman 
why this particular branch of knowledge should spread 
until its influence takes effect in a marked degree upon 
the health of the children of the poor in large cities, 
who now have to struggle as best they can against 
sour milk, heat, dust, tenement-life, and all the evils 
and discomforts that attend the very poor, absence of 
4

38 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
cleanliness being generally the greatest evil. Those 
engaged in visiting the poor in cities where ignorance 
reigns supreme, reveal pitiful cases of poverty, care- 
lessness, and ignorance. Baby’s milk is left uncovered 
all day long in the stifling atmosphere of one living- 
room, or is placed with other food in a sink, which 
becomes the refrigerator for those who cannot afford 
ice, and here absorbs germs by the million. 
The underlying truth of all the past and present 
agitation concerning the purity of the milk-supply and 
the problem of substitute infant feeding is that both 
have been sadly neglected for many years, with the 
pitiful result of a vast amount of suffering and many 
premature deaths of children from one to five years of 
age, especially during the hot summer months, when it is 
80 difficult not only to secure a pure supply, but also to 
protect the milk upon which these little ones depend. 
Comparatively few people stop to consider how quickly 
dangerous changes take place in this important article 
of food, and how readily it becomes contaminated by 
absorption of various volatile substances. This is par- 
ticularly true of those who have the immediate charge 
of milk. It is appalling to any one understanding 
the subject and its bearings to see the carelessness that 
is frequently displayed by the milkmen, maids, and nurses, all of whom play so important a part in infant dietetics, Is it any wonder that philanthropists, scien- tists, and physicians have combined in solicitous effort 
to provide a pure supply of milk and to show how it should be properly administered to save helpless and suffering infants? The subject is of infinite impor- tance, and the truths concerning it should be iterated
-P-A-G-E-55
INFANT FEEDING. 39 
and reiterated until satisfactory evidence has been 
given that persistence has been of some avail in 
changing existing conditions that are a reproach to 
our people and a menace to our health as a nation. 
Medical science has made important and rapid prog- 
ress in this direction, as is evidenced by the work 
done by Drs. Jacobi, Rotch, Holt, and many others, 
and by the establishment of milk laboratories where 
a child’s food may be called for by prescription and 
be prepared with the same care as is ordinarily sup- 
posed riecessary for medicines only. 
A brief outline of the work possible to be done with 
the assistance of these laboratories is as follows: the 
cows supplying the milk receive the care required to 
provide as pure a milk as it is possible to procure; the 
milk is properly handled and cared for; the cream is 
separated from the milk by a separator specially 
adapted to the purpose; other ingredients, such as 
cereal jellies, lime water, boiled water, etc., required 
for the modification of milk, are held in readiness, and 
all the materials used are clean, sterile, and exact in 
thei: percentages ; the physician making use of labora- 
tory methods calls for certain percentages of foods re- 
quired in the especial case he has in charge; the milk 
modifier simply follows directions. Dr. Rotch says, 
“ An opportunity has for the first time in the history 
of medicine been presented for the physician to carry 
out his own methods, for the first time to be judged 
on a fair basis. In this way only can each clinical 
observer, when lacking in success, be sure that it is the 
fault of the food he is giving, and not because the food 
has varied from what he supposed he had ordered.”
-P-A-G-E-56
40 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
Each day’s feeding of each individual infant is re- corded. During a period of three years Dr. Rotch was able to test the value of this method by the feed- 
ing of nearly three thousand infants, and his data in the practical use of this system at the time was gath- ered by about four hundred physicians. He says he believes a new era has been entered upon in the prov- 
ince of infant feeding which will enable physicians to produce results that have never before been obtained. 
\ The first milk laboratory for the exact modification 
of milk that has been established in the world is the . One that was opened to the public in 1891 in Boston, 
“under the name of the Walker-Gordon Laboratory. 
Since that time others have been established in New York, Philadelphia, ete. 
For those who are beyond the reach of these labo- ratories, except by correspondence, Dr. Rotch has formulated a plan for the modification of milk at homie, which is clearly explained in “ Pediatrics.” 
Hf mothers will study this plan practically they may materially aid. physicians who are away from labora- tories in arranging a substitute food that will be likely to agree'with the infant-in question. It would be a very simple matter for any mother (relying upon her family physician for assistance in regulating ingre- dients) to follow these directions, if only in a general way, with advantage to her child, as they are based upon purity of source and handling of an infant’s food, and caution and exactness in preparing, administering, and changing from one kind of food to another. Dr. Jacobi says a good food for a baby does not mean one which simply does not kill, (itis one which permits a

child to grow up healthy and strong. To perfect a 
substitute food exactness is required. This is made 
possible by laboratory methods. The apparatus re- 
quired for home modification can be procured from the 
original laboratory in Boston, or from those in New 
York, Philadelphia, etc. It consists of a home steril- 
izer, a thermometer to indicate the heat within the ean, 
tabes for the milk, a roll of aseptic, non-absorbent 
cotton for stoppers, a cozy, an 84-ounce glass graduate 
divided into half-drachms, a milk-sugar measure, hold- 
ing 3g drachms, which obviates the expense of having

the milk-sugar put up in packages by the apothecary, 
and is sufficiently exact to regulate the sugar per- 
centages in the mixtures likely to be directed by the 
physician (if preferred, one pound may be divided into 
thirty-five packages, one package to be used instead 
of a measureful), and, finally, a glass siphon, which is 
a very necessary adjunct in preparing an infant’s food. 
“Tt should be a glass tube one-quarter to one-half 
inch in diameter, and it can be bent in a gas-flame. 
The end out of which the milk is to flow should be at 
least six inches longer than that which is to be inserted 
in the jar. To operate the siphon, fill with boiled 
water, close the longer end with the finger, invert the 
siphon, and place the shorter end in the milk (at the 
bottom of the jar). Then withdraw the finger, and 4*

42 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
the water followed by the milk, will run out of the 
long arm of the siphon. Do not use the mouth to 
start the flow of the milk through the siphon under 
any circumstances.” (Rotch.) 
Every direction must be followed with care as to hey 
minutest detail. Herd milk is preferable to that o 
one cow; the cows should be of common breed, and 
such as give a moderately rich milk; the milk should 
be drawn with clean hands; the udders and teats of 
the cows should be cleansed, and the cows should be 
milked in as clean a place as possible ; the milk should 
be thoroughly strained through sterile gauze or cotton 
and rapidly cooled in ice water in a jar covered with 
a sterile cloth (Jacobi), 
The jar is then sealed tightly, as you would for pre- 
serving, and is left in the ice water for six hours, care 
being taken that the water does not fall below 1.66° 
C. (85° F.). City milk as delivered in jars should be 
siphoned, in the manner already described, when re- 
ceived, as the cream has already risen. It is possible 
in many cities now to secure certified milk ; this should 
be used in preference to ordinary city milk, which is 
frequently twenty hours old by the time it reaches the 
consumer. 
At the end of the time required for the rising of the 
cream, siphon out carefully from the bottom of the jar 
with the siphon described three-quarters of the milk ’ into a clean glass vessel, leaving half a pint of cream. Satisfactory substitutes for the siphon are Chapin’s 
flat-bottomed dipper, or, still better, a dipper with a conical bottom. When none of these mechanical de- vices is to be obtained, the upper layers may be care~

fully poured off. One of the chief difficulties in making 
accurate home modifications lies in the uncertainty as 
to what percentage of fat is actually present in the 
cream. If cream of a definite strength and fat-free 
milk are obtained from the milk laboratories, the per- 
centage modification of milk can be made within very

small limits of error (Rotch). Such milk and cream 
can be shipped long distances in sealed glass jars, and 
whenever possible should be used for home modifica- 
tion. You now have in a separate vessel the milk

five minutes, which, with some fresh lime water and 
the milk-sugar in packages or measure, prepares you 
for following your physician’s advice as to percentages. 
Inasmuch as every child requires different percent- 
ages in the same way that every adult needs food suited 
to his capabilities in various directions, it is manifestly 
impossible to give a routine mixture, and this part of 
infant feeding should always devolve upon the family 
physician. Dr. Jacobi says an infant’s food ought to

be mixed with large quantities of water, and he advo- 
cates a plentiful addition to all children’s food. He 
says a small amount of starch is digested at the very 
earliest. age, and recommends barley water and oatmeal 
water as diluents. Dr. Westcott, of Philadelphia, has 
constructed a device for rapid calculations of percent~ 
ages that Dr. Rotch calls ingenious and simple. The 
above directions are given in the hope that mothers 
and others of the laity who are in charge of children
-P-A-G-E-63
INFANT FEEDING. 45 
will realize the necessary of going hand-in-hand with 
physicians who are working faithfully to reach a safe 
basis for infant feeding. Mothers and nurses can aid 
materially in this work if they will only take the 
initiatory steps and make themselves competent assist- 
ants in work of this kind. 
Dr. Seibert, of New York, has recommended a 
system of filtering through a thin layer of clean ab- 
sorbent cotton, which plan admirably replaces in 
families the centrifugal method of large milk estab- 
lishments. A writer on this subject in the New 
York Medical Journal speaks of the gross filth that 
is removed by this process, and says, “It not only 
keeps dirt out of the nursing-bottle but also out of 
the alimentary canal of the infant, where, not being 
digestible, it is reinfected and can only do harm.” It 
is said that the bacteria in milk are reduced in num- 
bers one-half by this method of filtering. Dr. Seibert 
has had made for the purpose carefully prepared cotton 
disks and funnels. 
Taking it for granted that the above directions have 
been followed, and that the physician has given the 
formula required for immediate use in the case of 
whatever infant is being fed, the next point to be con- 
sidered is the purity of the milk that is to be used. In 
some exceptional places, and under some exceptional 
circumstances, milk may be so well cared for as to be 
comparatively free from bacteria, and the cows may 
be known by test to be free from tuberculosis, but in 
the majority of instances this cannot be relied upon, 
and it may then become necessary to heat the milk to 
75° ©. (167° F.), a temperature sufficiently high to kill
-P-A-G-E-64
46 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
those developed bacteria which would be of any harm 
to the digestion of the infant, and at the same time low 
enough to prevent changes that are now acknowledged 
by nearly all physician to be undesirable in an infant’s 
normal. food,—changes that are caused by the tempera- | 
ture (212° F.) formerly advised for the destruction of 
germs existing in milk. The temperature of 75° cg 
(167° F-.) allows the milk to remain practically fresh, 
uncooked, and sterile. The higher degree of 100° C. 
(212° F.) may be used in case of journeys, and when 
the milk, for unavoidable reasons, must be kept for a 
period longer than twenty-four hours ; but for ordinary 
usage in the family this temperature need not be con- 
sidered, unless under a physician’s advice; as, for ex- 
ample, in cases of summer complaint in early infancy, 
when the higher temperature might be desirable. The 
degree of 167° F. may be applied to the entire mixture 
of ingredienis called for, including the lime water, which 
is changed by the higher temperature of 212° F. ; hence, 
in the event of 212° F. being used, the lime water must 
added to. each feeding when it is given to the child. 
There are various devices offered for the application 
of an exact degree of heat to milk, notably the Walker- 
Gordon laboratory sterilizer, the Arnold steamer, Dr. 
Freeman’s pasteurizer, one designed by Dr. Decker, 
of Kingston, New York, and that of Dr. Seibert rec- 
ommended by Jacobi. Exact directions are given with 
each, and:any one of them may be readily procured by 
any druggist. If great precautions are taken to guard the milk and cream the mixture made from them need 
not be pasteurized or sterilized. In many cases, how- 
ever, the physician may deem it safer to heat the milk,

especially when he is treating a case of gastro-enteric 
disturbance, or when in hot weather it is necessary to 
transport the food a long distance (Rotch). If heating 
is ordered, any of the pasteurizers mentioned may be 
used. 
Dr. Rotch says, in “ Pediatrics,” when an infant has 
a delicate digestion or is sick, it is often better to heat 
the milk to 68.3° C. (155° F.). This temperature is 
sufficient to kill those developed bacteria which would 
be of any harm to the digestion of the infant, and at 
the same time is below 72° C. (161.6° F-), the point 
at which coagulation of the proteids is supposed to 
take place. We thus obtain a practically pure, fresh 
milk, uncooked and sterile. . . . If the milk is to be 
sent an unusually long distance, if the weather is hot, 
or if the milk-supply has to last more than twenty- 
four hours, a higher degree of heating can be used. . . . 
100° C. (212° F.) is a temperature used for these 
purposes at the laboratory. When, again, we wish 
the milk to be absolutely sterilized, as may be the 
case when we are preparing it for an ocean voyage 
or for a trip across the continent, not only a high 
degree of heat [100° C. (212° F-.)], but two or three 
heatings, with intervals of twenty-four hours, a 
necessary for this complete sterilization. ... Te 
minutes is often a sufficient length of time to kill dv 
veloped bacteria and make this especially protected 
(laboratory) milk practically sterile. Experience, how- 
ever, has proved that during transportation the milk 
is often exposed to temperatures conducive to the 
further development of bacteria, and that practically 
the bacteriological results which we obtain in the labo-
-P-A-G-E-68
48 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
ratory do not entirely hold when the milk is exposed 
to these varied conditions of transit. As a rule, there- 
fore, from twenty to thirty minutes is the proper time 
to heat mixtures of modified milk sent from the labo- 
ratory. 
The Freeman pasteurizer was designed very accu- 
rately for household convenience by Rowland Godfrey 
Freeman, M.D., of New York, and does not require 
the use of a thermometer, as a definite temperature is 
reached by the process. 
  
     Both sterilization and pasteurization have con- 
quered a fair standing in the popular mind. Unless, 
however, there be a rational time limit the practice 
may become dangerous ; the decomposition of the milk 
by oversterilization I: have discussed before; scurvy 
and other ailments may be its results. In New York 
the writings and practical instruction of Dr. Rowland 
Godfrey Freeman have been of great advantage, par- ticularly to its poor population. He insists upon
-P-A-G-E-69

pasteurization as a sufficient method of safety. The 
apparatus devised by him is thoroughly appropriate. 
As the adviser of Mr. Nathan Straus in his successful 
endeavors to supply thousands with a safe article of 
food, he has benefited the city and aided in setting an 
example which should and will be imitated” (Jacobi’s 
“Therapeutics of Infancy and Childhood ”). 
A recent description of this great charity gives some 
startling figures in this connection. According to Dr. 
Edson, from one to two per cent. of the. cows of the 
great dairy state of New York have tuberculosis, and 
he says that all milk coming to the city should be 
sterilized before it is sold. * 
“Mr. Straus’ work,” says Dr. Edson, “has beer 
great value in educating the people to the danger 
using raw milk. He has reached a class of people 
which has very little knowledge of the dangers of raw 
milk.” Eminent scientists and physicians were con- 
sulted by Mr. Straus when this charity was first estab- 
lished years ago, and to-day the great work goes on 
uninterruptedly. Other cities have adopted the sys- 
tem. Physicians and public institutions eulogize it, 
and now comes news from Europe that England, 
Germany, and France are inaugurating the same kind 
of work. It is expected that New York City will 
soon have a public extension of this work. At this 
date of publication, May, 1909, discussions, for and 
against such extension, are being presented by the 
New York Herald. See preface.

being established in Paris, with the first sessions to be 
held October 21 and 22. The methods ruling in 
Straus’ establishment are as follows: The purest coun- 
try milk available is heated to 167° F. for twenty 
minutes, cooled rapidly with ice, and sent to the vari- 
ous depots: No. 151 Avenue C, No. 241 East Fifty-

twelfth Street; Recreation Pier, Barrow Street ; Rec- 
reation Pier, West Fiftieth Street ; and Educational 
Alliance Roof Garden. 
Work in laboratory and depots begins at four o’clock 
each morning, and during all the long, hot, early 
hours of the day crowds of children and mothers with 
babies in their arms or infants at breast come for this 
life-giving milk. 
A physician is in charge of the laboratory. Besides 
attending to the pasteurization of the milk and its dis- 
tribution, he visits the fifteen milk depots every day and examines and prescribes free of charge for the sick ones, thus materially increasing the already great value of this work for the poor. 
The milk is given free to the poor and sold at less than cost to those who wish to buy. In the parks it 
is sold at a cont a glass or five cents a quart, at the stations in bottles of sizes holding three, six, : and eight ounces—truly a magnificent example and a practical

charity, and one deserving of imitation, as pointed out 
by Dr, Jacobi three years ago, if properly conserved. 
The care of bottles, nipples, ete. is naturally an 
important part of infant feeding. The seamless nip- 
ples made in Philadelphia, and described by me some 
years ago in “ Babyhood,” are remarkably easy to 
keep clean, They are very smooth, care-

its food too fast), easily cleaned, and they |

they should be kept in a covered box or 
dish, or wrapped up in a clean napkin, 
and just before using them they should 
be dipped in boiling water. This must 
not be omitted. The usual plan is to

is preferable. 
The “ Hygeia” nursing device marks a step in ad- 
vance in nursery bottles and nipples, as may readily 
be seen from the accompanying illustration. It was 
designed by a physician * to resemble in every possi- 
ble respect the natural source of an infant’s food, and 
the greatest evident advantages are the ease with which 
both tip and bottle may be cleansed, the doing away 
with both funnel and brush, the resemblance to the 
mother’s breast (as a child frequently refuses the bottle, 
when being weaned, on account of the size of the

nipple), and the slow feeding resulting from the care- 
fully punctured holes. . 
Milk-bottles can be thoroughly cleaned by rinsing 
first with cold water, then washing with hot soapsuds 
and a bottle-brush that is clean. The brush requires 
as much care as the bottles, a fact that is sometimes 
overlooked. Rinse the bottles, both inside and out, in 
an abundance of flowing clean water, preferably under 
the cold-water faucet, and examine each bottle care- 
fully to see that there is no cloudiness or speck of 
milk remaining. They may then be placed in the rack 
and set in a moderately hot oven for an hour, when 
they will be sterile and ready for use, or they may be 
put over a fire in a boiler filled with cold water, to 
boil for half an hour, when they should be carefully 
drained and kept free from dust. Experiment will 
show that the oven method is preferable, as the bottles 
are dry and ready to be put away when removed from 
the oven. Care should be taken to cool the oven 
slightly by opening the door a few minutes before re- 
moving the hot bottles. This will prevent the cracking 
that might result upon sudden exposure to the colder 
ir of the room. 
fter an infant has been fed, the empty or half- 
empty bottle of milk should not be allowed to stand 
for any length of time. It should be emptied directly, 
or as soon as possible, and be rinsed with cold water.

frequently the presence of a baby in the house insures 
the appearance at all times and in all places of half- 
empty or unclean-looking milk-bottles, which un- 
doubtedly cause much of the illness usually ascribed 
either to the visitation of Providence or to a sup- 
posedly impure supply of milk. Careful observation 
will convince many that not one cause alone is the 
‘source of evils met with constantly in infant feeding. 
S The intervals in substitute feeding must be care- 
‘ally considered. Dr. Rotch’s table for intervals in 
breast-feeding (p. 25) applies equally to substitute feed- 
ing. His table for amounts is as follows :

ing an organ s0 easily distensible as the stomach that it 
is wiser to give too little 1ather than too much food in 
the early days of life. An unusually heavy child 
might require a little more ; for instance, a child weigh- 
  ing ten pounds at birth would, according to tables 
regulated by weight, require 1} ounces instead of 1 ounce at a feeding, if in a healthy condition ; but this the attending physician should determine. Dr. Rotch 
advises the use of a set of graduated feeding-tubes
-P-A-G-E-75
‘INFANT FEEDING. 55 
during the more important periods of growth, for the 
purpose of continually impressing upon the mother and 
the nurse what the physician often has the opportunity 
of telling them only at the beginning of the nursing 
period,—namely, that the error is in giving too much 
food rather than too little. This error naturally re- 
sults when, as is commonly the case, the usual eight- 
ounce nursing-bottle is used at the very beginning of 
infantile life ; but care can prevent such error. 
He says he has found that he can easily convince 
most mothers of the mistaken zeal of nurses who 
advocate giving the young infant large amounts of 
food, by showing them the size of the infant’s stomach 
at birth (A) and comparing this small tube (B) which

of well-established principles in infant dietetics, and 
ignoring the fact entirely that it is unsafe for the laity 
to decide upon so important a question, it is to be 
hoped that they will at least bear in mind the follow- 
ing facts: That it is frequently advisable (1) to in- 
sure purity of milk by heating to about 167° F. from

   twenty to thirty minutes; (2) to cool it quickly and keep it cool and covered ; (3) to dilute each feeding with boiled water, barley water, or oatmeal water, for the first nine or ten months of the first year of an in- fant’s life, beginning with at least half the diluent to half milk for an infant one month old ; (4) to use top milk so the proper proportion of sweet cream may be

present in each feeding ; (5) to add milk or cane-sugar 
and a little salt, according to your physician’s direc- 
tions; (6) and to add carefully prepared cereal foods 
as soon after eight months as your physician will 
allow, 
TE, however, the whole duty owed to children 
is fully appreciated by those in charge of their 
welfare, all uncertain methods will be avoided and 
every point relating to the feeding of a child, from in- 
fancy to adolescence, will be carefully considered and 
its importance be fully estimated. Dr. Rotch says 
truly that the subject is a great one, worthy of the 
attention of the greatest minds of the age, and that 
the responsibility of discussing so serious a question 
is a grave one, that should be taken up carefully and 
dealt with broadly. He says “the preventive medi- 
cine of early life becomes pre-eminently the intelligent 
management of the nutriment which enables young 
human beings to breathe and grow and live.”

Cereals, Bread, Biscuit, and Cake. 
\ CEREALS. 
EREALS are a necessary food for growing children, 
as they are rich in the constituents required for energy 
and for tissue-building, and promote fine muscular de- 
velopment. As more of tissue food is needed when 
the body is growing rapidly than in adult life when 
repair alone is called for, cereal foods must not be 
neglected at the proper time. Starch being the pre- 
dominant constituent, it is evident that great care must 
be-exercised in cooking the various grains allowable in_ 
the_nursery, always keeping in view the fact that a 
double boiler of agate or porcelain is necessary, and 
that long cooking increases digestibility, It is im- 
portant to know what you want to accomplish when 
cooking cereals, . @u starchy foods should be cooked 
long enough to be put in a condition to be easily acted 
upon by the digestive juices. The purpose in pre- 
paring them is to secure the Barsting of the granules 
and the liberation of the starch by the highest tem- 
perature it is possible to reach, that it may be acted 
upon by the heat and be partially changed into a sub- 
aa nit tte which is easily digested. .An extpémely high and prolonged temperature is required fox this change, without oe cereals are not nu- 
tritions and are likely to chuse digestive troubles, 58
-P-A-G-E-79
CEREALS. 59 
Starch foods imperfectly cooked undergo. formentation, ) 
erefore it is necessary that this method of cooking 
grains be followed for the nursery. Diastase, a sub- 
stance found in growing grains and used in malt ex- 
tracts, is sometimes used for this purpose, especially 
for children who are ill or convalescent, as it effects a 
more complete change of the starch, thereby saving an 
appreciable amount of force in the alimentary tract, 
but it should be used by medical advice only, as a 
healthy child, if properly fed from the first, should 
not need it. 
The following cereals are all suitable for nursery 
use: granulated or crushed wheat, which is an all- 
year-round food, possessing no fat, and requiring cream 
to make it a perfect winter food; cornmeal, a winter 
food, food, which builds up strong tissues and is useful in 
constipation ; purified or cooked gluten, the latter of 
which is always ready for use; oat flour, from which 
a delicious blanc-mange can be nade; erashed barley, 
which, when properly cooked in milk or water, is an 
easily digested nursery food, and when mixed with 
gluten, half and half, stirred into cold water, and 
afterwards well cooked, is extremely palatable; farina, 
which when subjected to high heat in preparation be- 
comes a desirable and nutritious nursery food, used 
either as a gruel, a porridge, or in desserts. 
The list of cereal preparations to be found for sale 
is endless, but for nursery use one need not go far to 
find a few perfectly prepared foods of this class that 
are assimilable when properly cooked, and which will 
supply the needs of growing children in variety as’ 
well as in constituents. Being heat-producers, they

should be used carefully in warm weather ; (wie 
____hominy, rice, gluten, barley, rye, and wheat~prepara-, 
tions are the most desirable, as they possess. little or 
no fat. “ 
Farinaceous foods should not be used at all during 
the first year, unless by medical advice, and they must 
be used very cautiously even in the second year, when 
milk should still predominate as a food. 
Oatmeal is the usual cereal to begin with in the 
nursery, as it coiitains all the necessary elements for 
growth, including fat, but for this very reason, if the 
use of cereals is begun in warm weather, wheat is pref- 
erable. When cereals are first given to children after 
an exclusive milk diet, difficulty in digesting them is 
sometimes experienced. The change must be made 
very gradually. Fairchild’s peptogenic powder may be 
used in a very simple and satisfactory way with cereals 
if any trouble is manifest, by sprinkling it lightly 
upon porridge or any starchy food, using care to have 
the food warm—not hot. When used in this way it 
should noé be relied upon for any length of time, but 
should be gradually discontinued as strength for digest- 
ing starchy foods increases. A little observation will 
soon show whether it is advisable or necessary, Where 
there is doubt the child’s physician should be consulted. 
When used in this way it should be considered a tem- 
porary aid only. 
For preparing cereals the proportions of water, 
milk, salt, ete., may readily be learned from any cook- book, or froma little experience, individual preferences requiring various amounts for the consistency desired. Personally, I prefer the use of a larger proportion of

water than is usually given. ‘They should be served 
preferably with salt and cream; however, in cases of 
particularly active digestion and where dietaries are 
well regulated a little pure sugar (granulated) may be 
allowed. 
BREAD AND BISCUIT. 
The government reports of the adulteration of bread 
with alum, sulphate of copper, ammonia, flours other 
than wheat, inferior grades of flour, damaged pease, 
ground rice, cornmeal, etc., should be sufficient to con- 
vince the most sceptical mother that(for ‘nursery_use. 
well-made home-made bread is infinitéty preferable to 
ofdiiiaty baker’s bread. According to these Same" re> 
  white flour of commerce was considered the most de- 
sirable, but during recent years, with the advances 
made in the study of dietetics, the nutrient value of 
the gluten of the wheat grain has become appreciated, 
ana improved methods of milling have been adopted, 
which prepare wheat in such a way as to preserve the 
dark layer of gluten which, when remaining in the 
flour, changes its color from white to brownish yellow. 
This gluten is a necessary constituent for the perfect 
food that wheat should be, containing as it does all the 
elements that form muscle, blood, and brain, being de- 
ficient only in fat, which may be supplied, if desired, 
by the use of oat flour, in the proportion of one-third, 
but for general use for bread in the nursery there is —

bread is vastly to be preferred to that made from the 
whiter flours of less nutrition, as it supplies nutrients 
usually received by adults through other articles of 
food. Well-baked. cornmeal bread or muffins-may~be 
used, at certain ‘ages, in fall and winter, a8 ‘an occa— 
sional variation, as cornmeal is heating, noutishing, 
and easily digested, but care must be taken to have the 
meal fresh, aiid’ not to use the bread when freshly 
baked} ti fact, all bread for the nursery should be at 
leastone day old, and should be thoroughly baked. 
Very few people of the present day realize or will ac- 
knowledge how many intestinal disorders are caused 
by the use of new bread, hot biscuit, etc. Their use 
should be strictly forbidden in the nursery, and well- 
made bread or cake is always improved by being kept 
wrapped in a cloth—in a perfectly dry covered..box: 
tin being better than ‘wood, as it does not grow musty. 
Good bread should possess moisture, but not noticeably 
80. It should be of a yellowish-white color, and have 
asweet, nutty flavor. It should also be of such a con- 
sistency as to crumble very easily. Practical experi- 
ence is the best teacher when one is endeavoring to reach 
these conditions. 
The gluten flour advised above absorbs more water 
than ordinary starchy flours, and needs less yeast. 
Brewer’s yeast, which gives a good flavor on account of the hops used, or good home-made yeast, is not undesirable, but in these busy days no one need hesi-~ tate to save time and trouble by using the commercial compressed yeast of deservedly good repute, as it an-
-P-A-G-E-83

swers every purpose. Heated milk may be used for 
mixing instead of water, if preferred, but a very good 
bread may be made very easily as follows, according to 
a recipe given by a cook who learned her art in Ireland. 
Her method reverses the usual directions in regard to 
the temperature of the oven, which, judging from the 
delicious results, is a very sensible procedure. The 
ease with which the bread is made will commend it to 
the busy housewife. Begin in the morning: 
Flour, three quarts, sifted in a large bowl ; 
Salt, two heaping tablespoonfuls ; 
Sugar, four heaping tablespoonfuls ; 
Water, or milk and water, two quarts, lukewarm ; 
Yeast, one cake ; 
Lard, three heaping tablespoonfuls. 
Put the salt, sugar, and lard into the flour, and rub 
the lard fine by crumbling it lightly between the hands. 
Use warmed flour, especially in winter. Flour should 
always be warm for best results in baking. A good 
plan is to keep constantly on hand near the fire a bag 
or covered pan of well-dried flour for bread, cake, or 
biscuit. Dissolve the yeast in the warm water, and 
pour it over the flour, mixing with the hands; then 
sift in gradually a quart or more of flour, adding until 
the dough can be turned out on the board. Knead 
lightly from ten to fifteen minutes, adding flour until 
the loaf does not stick to the board. Put it back in 
the bowl, cover lightly, and let it rise in a temperature 
of about 75° F. for three hours. Cut into loaves 
and put into buttered pans, letting them rise on the 
rack above the range, or in a place of equal tempera- 
ture, for half an hour, when they will be ready to be
-P-A-G-E-84
64 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
placed in a moderately quick oven. After half an 
hour, as the bread rises in the oven, increase the heat 
slowly to the end of the time required to bake the 
loaves. The time to be allowed for baking an aver- 
age-sized loaf is one and a quarter hours. The usual 
plan in baking bread is to begin with a temperature 
of 400° F., gradually lowering to 250° F., with the 
frequent result of a loaf of bread that is soggy in the 
inside and very hard on the outside. In the above 
method the reverse is the case. The result should be 
dry, well-baked, evenly browned loaves of bread, that 
still retain enough moisture to keep them as they 
should be. The use of an oven thermometer is advised. 
The art of making good bread is certainly one of 
the most important cooking processes to which atten- 
tion should be directed in the present era of reform in 
ietetics and household science. The digestibility of 
bread and its nutritive properties depend very largely 
upon the mode of preparation and the kind of flour 
employed. (Yeo.) Coarse meal breads are unfit for the 
nursery, as they are usually"héavy and indigestible. 
Bauer observés’ of bread made of coarse, adhesive 
meal, “Such adhesive breads are very imperfectly 
utilized by the human organs of digestion, since the 
irritation they cause to the mucous membrane of the 
alimentary canal leads to a rapid progress and early 
evacuation of its contents.” This explains the occa- 
sional use of such bread for adults, but other methods 
should be employed in the nursery for a difficulty 
which need not exist with the proper care of diet. ‘The use of bread made from the whole grain meal 
“about be exicouraged fOr children, for the following   
-P-A-G-E-85

reasons: they must be restricted in a meat diet, there- 
fore such bread supplies a much-needed addition; it 
contains forty instead of twenty per cent. of gluten, 
and contains twice as large a proportion of certain 
salts—chiefly phosphates—as white bread; it con- 
tains also the laxative fatty matter upon which great 
dependence is placed when arranging a dietary for 
children. 
Some idea of the proportions of nutrients in beef, 
oysters, and flour may be gained from the reports of 
the Storrs’ School Agricultural Experiment Station, 
Connecticut, where Professor Atwater, whose diet 
articles have explained much that has hitherto been 
but vaguely understood, conducted experiments that 
mark this era as an important one in domestic 
science in its relation to dietetics. He says that 2 
quarter of a dollar invested in the sirloin of beef at 
twenty-two cents per pound pays for one and one- 
seventh pounds of the meat with three-eighths of a 
pound of actually nutritive material, which would 
supply 1120 calories of energy—i.c., heat—to keep the 
body warm and give muscular power for work. The 
same amount of money paid for oysters at the rate of 
fifty cents per quart secures but two ounces of actual 
nutrients, 250 calories of energy. But in buying 
wheat flour at seven dollars a barrel, the twenty-five 
cents pay for six and a quarter pounds of nutrients 
and 11,755 calories of energy. 3500 calories are 
said by Professor Atwater to represent the American 
standard for the fuel value to be derived from a proper 
dietary for a man with moderate muscular work. It 
is of importance that facts like these should be gen- 
6 6* E
-P-A-G-E-86
66 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
erally known, as this knowledge is one of the first 
steps towards dietary reform. ‘ 
Points to remember in buying flour and baking 
bread are that a good bread flour does not cake in the 
hand when squeezed, that kneading must .be done 
lightly to keep the bread porous, and that the temper- 
ature for the rising of the sponge should be from 70° 
to 80° F., not higher. 
7 The use of bread in the nursery may begin as early 
as twelve months if a sufficient number of teeth are 
‘" present, which should be the case at this age.) Dr. 
Rotch says, “Good butter on the bread may usiially be 
allowed at sixteen months.” 
In some form, at the ages indicated, bread or biscuit 
should be given at each meal,—i.c., stale bread or crust 
of French bread, zwieback, toast, and Graham bread, 
or soda, oatmeal, Graham, gluten, or educator biscuits. 
These are all permissible when they can be chewed 
thoroughly. Oatmeal and Graham biscuits belong 
to laxative foods, and should be used accordingly. 
Jerome Walker, M.D., pertinently says, in regard to 
this subject,* that “probably, with the exception of 
candy, no article that is eaten is so much abused as the 
animal-biseuit. Before these biscuits were introduced 
children were content with a few butter, soda, milk, or 
even ordinary sweet biscuits at one time, but now the 
child is anxious to eat a number of animals. The 
biseuit-maker, detecting this propensity in children, 
furnishes a wonderful assortment of animals, and the 
child is eager to eat one, at least, of each kind pur- I EEO OF Cac Stn’ PUY

chased. The mother thinks these animals are so nice 
for the children to play with that frequently she sends 
out for a half-pound or a pound, and gives them to 
the child to keep him_quict as he is trundled along 
in his carriage. What is the consequence of so much 
sugar and starch? It perverts the appetite, teaches 
the child to reject soups, broths, bread and butter, and 
milk, and to prefer sweets and pastries, and also in- 
duces starchy dyspepsia.” 
The use of zwieback (twice-baked bread) can be 
thoroughly recommended. It possesses the advantage 
of being more easily digested than ordinary bread on 
account of the complete conversion of the starch into 
dextrine as the result of the double baking. 
The following recipe may be used for zwieback, for 
a change from that made from ordinary home-made 
bread : 
MORAVIAN CAKE. 
This is best when started in the morning, unless the 
last rising can be attended to very early in the morning. 
If this can be done, set the sponge about five o’clock in 
the evening, using one cup of potatoes mashed in one 
cup of the water in which they were boiled, one cup of 
sugar, one-half cake of yeast dissolved in a little warm 
water, with flour enough to makea thick batter. Cover 
and keep in a warm place (about 80° F.); beat oc- 
casionally during the evening, and at ten or eleven 
o’clock mix in the batter one cup of sugar, three eggs, 
and three-quarters of a cup of lard and butter, a pinch 
of cinnamon, and enough flour to stiffen, kneading it 
well into a dough that will not stick to the sides of the

to 75° F., until early in the morning, shape into loaves 
or any form desired, let rise for half an hour, spread 
the cake with a sauce made of a cup of sugar, one 
tablespoonful of hot water, a small piece of butter, and 
enough cinnamon to darken the sauce, and bake in a 
moderate oven. 
The above may be used as sweet bread, cake, or 
toast. By cutting it into thin slices, buttering it lightly, 
and browning delicately in the oven, you have a deli- 
cious change for the frequently stereotyped nursery 
menu.

CHAPTER IV. 
Broths and Soups. 
THE first point to impress well upon the mind in 
making broths and soups for the nursery is that good... 
material must be used, and that the meat must be 
treated i in such a manner as to extract the nutritious 
juices. This cannot be done by using hot or boiling 
water, which, incredible as it may seem to ‘those who 
know better, is frequently done. Cold_salted_ water 
_inust be used, and the meat should be. “allowed to-stiak 
in “in the wat e water for several hours before it is subjected to, 
heat. Even then it should only simmer (not exceed- 
ing 160° F.). At the last it may be boiled for one 
or two hours to dissolve the gelatin of the bones, 
etc., if they are used, but this is not necessary, as 
chopped lean meat is preferable for nursery use, and 
a continued low temperature without boiling will pro- 
duce a very nutritious broth. The time for simmer- 
ing may be regulated by the requirements of the 
household, the minimum time being two hours. If 
the broth is to be used the same day, it is well to have 
the meat delivered at an early hour, as this will allow 
ample time for the entire process before the hour of 
nursery dinner, using ice for cooling and skimming, 
which must be carefully done. It is preferable, how- 
ever, to have it made’ the day previous, as then every 
‘particle of fat can be removed. Fat plays a very

important—part-in-nursery diet, but it is not. tobe 
served floating upon poorly made soups. The greatest 
care should be exercised in this direction. 
Chopped lean beef’ or mutton (from the neck ‘prefer- 
ably), a half-pound daily, with one pint of water, 
different vegetable seasonings, with a little veal added 
to the broth occasionally, should give sufficient variety, 
with the addition of milk and chicken broths, for -he 
requirements of any nursery, Yet, if for any reason 
itis desirable to have something different, there are 
many well-recommended recipes from which to select. 
or cBildren over fourteen months of age rice, tapioca, 
barley, or sago may be added to beef or mutton broth, 
half a tablespoonful to the pint, but it must be thor- 
oughly cooked. Different vegetables may be added 
. Tn the same way, to give variety for children 
over two and a half years old, spinach, celery, onions, 
and cauliflower being especially useful from a dietetic 
stand-point. Macaroni in its various forms may also 
be used as an addition, and makes a pleasant change, 
If, in making broths, the measure given is reduced by 
cooking, add sufficient water to keep to its original 
quantity. When using parsley for seasoning, do not 
mince it in the usual way. Children will frequently 
object to it, and by using a bunch uncut the same 
result will be attained. This applies as well to celery, spinach, cauliflower, and onions, Children have been educated to eat these vegetables without any trouble 
beyond first introducing them into some favorite soup, 
not using too much at first, and having even that 
pressed through a purée sieve, gradually increasing 
the quantity until the taste is acquired. This is not

always necessary, as in some instances the little ones 
take kindly to and enjoy them from the first. The 
suggestion is given for those mothers who find diff- 
culty in getting children of three or four to eat juicy 
vegetables, which are an important adjunct to nursery 
fare. Dr. Yale says,* “The value of these vegetables 
is not so much from their nutritiousness, whietris“Hot 
very-high, as because of the salts they contain, and. be- 
catise they are palatable to many. “By Yedson of the 
salts, they are useful as preventives of scurvy, a dis- 
ease, however, not common in childhood, except when 
the diet has been particularly restricted. They should 
all be very thoroughly cooked, and if passed through 
a purée sieve will generally agree. But for some 
digestions the flatulent tendency of the onions and 
cauliflower cannot be gotten rid of even in this way.” 
Cooks should be instructed to save all the water in 
which..these vegetables have been boiled (taking it 
for granted that they have previously been properly 
washed), as there is nothing more delicious to add to 
stock than these flavored waters: They can also be 
utilized in making milk broth, which is nutritious as 
well as stimulating. Many an adult who dislikes 
milk, hot or cold, would be surprised, were he to try 
it, to find how palatable a well-seasoned hot milk 
broth can be, and how quickly it drives away that 
tired feeling which is the natural result of a busy 
da:

close cover is also necessary to prevent evaporation 
and to keep out the dust. 
The following recipe, given for a nutritious beef 
broth, will prove a comfort to busy mothers, as chil- 
dren rarely tire of it, and it can be made in quantity, 
keeping perfectly in a cool place. There is then very 
little labor connected with this portion of the dinner 
to be prepared daily beyond changing the seasoning 
from day today. Another point in its favor is that 
it may be taken from a cup or glass, consequently the 
busy mother is free to attend to the remainder of the 
dinner, or to take a moment’s rest while the little ones 
are enjoying their broth. Young children are gener- 
ally better able to handle a cup or glass carefully than 
a spoon, These things may appear trifling to many, 
but a little rest is a priceless boon to a tired mother, 
who too often pays little attention to her own require- 
ments in any direction. 
BEEF BROTH. 
/ The materials needed are chopped lean beef, cold 
salted water, in the proportion of a pound of meat to 
a quart of water for children two and three years of 
age, and a pint of water and one large onion cut into 
ieces for children over three, Soak the meat, and 
if used, in the cold. water for two hours at least 
(six is better) in the vessel in which it is to be cooked, keeping it on ice or in a cool place during this time. 
‘Then set it upon the back of the range, or, if it is to 
be made upon a gas, alcohol, or oil stove, use a double 
boiler, and keep the heat moderate by regulating the flame. Keep the vessel covered, and allow the broth         
-P-A-G-E-93
BROTHS AND SOUPS. 93 
to simmer, keeping up the original quantity of water 
for three hours at least. Let it cool overnight, remove 
the fat in the morning, and keep covered in a cool place 
until needed. If this is done, and the entire quantity 
is reheated to the boiling-point every time that some 
of it is used, it can be kept in winter for several days. 
A double boiler may be used very satisfactorily in 
making this or any other meat broth. 
The variety of seasoning should be considered when 
preparing the dinner for the general household, as labor 
is thus economized. For instance, if spinach is to be 
cooked for late dinner, a portion of it pressed through 
@ purée sieve, with some of the water in which it was 
boiled, should be saved for the children’s broth next 
day, care being taken to have it put on ice in china, 
glass, or agate, closely covered. (Spinach to be delicate 
must be boiled rapidly in a large quantity of water.) 
{ ‘There will be no danger of the little ones’ growing tired 
| of an endless succession of plain meat broths, if the 
; vegetables allowable in the nursery are used in this 
‘way for variety. 
Alternate the above for children over three years of 
age with any of the following soups, as they may fill 
in with the general household cooking; but it is ad- 
visable to have the beef broth on hand at all times to 
be provided for emergencies.

sieve into the water in which they were boiled, using 
an agate saucepan, adding sufficient boiling water to 
make a quart. Season with salt, add the milk, rub 
the butter and flour together, and stir into the soup, 
bringing it to the boiling-point, stirring all the time. 
Serve hot, as a tepid milk soup is abominable. By 
the time the little ones are ready to take it the tem-

Jelly, eto. CHICKEN BROTH. 
Cut up a fowl (not a young chicken) into small 
pieces, rejecting the fat and skin unless the latter is 
white and tender, cover with cold water, and simmer 
gently for six hours. Cool overnight, and remove 
the fat. A four-pound chicken will make two quarts 
of broth. A little gelatin dissolved in every cupful 
is useful in cases of convalescence, especially during 
digestive difficulties, and it may be used generally in 
the nursery. The broth may also be thickened with 
starch, flour, or arrow-root. 
/ Cie ilk is a particularly delicate preparation, 
and can be made-readily from the above if the broth 
has jellied. If not, it must be further reduced. Put ia saucepan a stalk of white celery and a stalk (not 
cut) of parsley with a little salt, add a pint of the 
chicken jelly with some of the meat, and boil until it falls from the bones. Strain and add the same quan- 
tity of fresh milk, presupposing that the pint of chicken broth has been kept intact. Bring this to the boiling- 
point several times and strain into a cup. This is

very nutritious, and forms a slight variety. (Trained

BARLEY BROTH. 
This broth is also very desirable for nursery use. 
Take the best end of a neck of mutton or lamb, cover 
with two quarts of cold water, and add a teacupful of 
rushed barley. Let it stand upon the back of a hot 
range’ for an hour, then move it forward, adding at 
this time the vegetables desired, cut nto small pieces, 
and let it simmer for five hours. 
Cool overnight. Skim and season with salt. It is 
almost impossible to skim mutton broth thoroughly 
unless it has stood overnight. Any one trying to do so 
will be easily convinced of the truth of this statement. 
I. Burney Yeo, M.D., says, “Soup at the beginning 
of the dinner has been objected to on the ground that 
it diminishes digestive power by diluting the gastric 
juice, and this objection is valid if a large quantity 
of badly made soup is taken. But it does not apply 
to a small quantity—four to eight ounces—of well- 
made clear soup. Such a fluid disappears quickly on 
reaching the stomach, as it is rapidly absorbed by the 
blood-vessels, and interferes in no way with the gastric 
juices. Its value at the commencement of the meals 
depends on the fact of its rapid absorption and en- 
trance into the blood, so that the hungry man is 
quickly refreshed.” 
This will explain to many the need of well-made 
soups, and will also indicate why the preference exists 
for the lighter broths, unless, as occasionally happens, 
the soup is made the principal feature of the meal, 
which should not occur in the nursery.

object in cooking meats is to retain as much 
nourishment and flavor as possible}and the process is 
directly opposite to that for niaking soup, a low tem- 
perature being required for the latter, while a very high one ig necessary for the former, to coagulate quickly 
the albumen on the outside surface and thus confine 
the nutritive juices within. 
o There are many methods of cooking meats for gen- 
“eral use, but for the nursery it is desirable to broil, boil, or roast,}with the preference for broiling, because 
it gives the best’ results in point of delicacy, and, if 
properly done, will be found in every way to be the 
most satisfactory. For the sake of convenience alone, 
broiling may well be considered and preferred, as mid- 
day dinner for adults is rapidly disappearing, and to 
roast or boil large joints of meat for possibly one 
child’s dinner is not generally feasible. 
Left-overs” are decidedly not to be used in the 
roe Jif for no other reason than that in many houses 
cooked“and uncooked foods of various kinds are kept in uncovered dishes from day to day in one common 
refrigerator or closet, absorbing unwholesome germs 
from surroundings that, to say the least, are not sani- tary. That such difficulties may be avoided, where the mother for sufficient reason is unable to supervise 16 ‘

affairs in her own kitchen, it is always safer to direct 
that the meats given to the children be broiled, unless 
the arrangements of the house will allow for meat that 
roasted or boiled in time for the nursery dinner. 
lection of meat that has been properly hung is 
tant as the cooking. It should be hung for a 
period varying from seven hours to six days. A 
reliable meat dealer is a necessity when one is buying ~ 
for the children. He is in a better position, and better 
able to judge and select, than the average householder, 
and it is a comparatively easy matter to interest him 
in the wants of the children and the necessity for the 
exercise of great care in selection. It is rather a diffixy 
cult matter to choose a good cut of meat. Yeo says 
that which contains much fat is generally less digest- 
ible and less palatable than lean meat; fat there is “ 
less nutritive value and more gelatin in the meat of 
young animals than in that of mature ones and that 
undoubtedly the most nutritious of animal 
nd is used most extensively. The best por- 
wr nursery use are from the™Toin for broiling, 
auu som the neck, ramp, or first and second cut 
of the round for other uses, which will be indicated. 
This selection is independent of joints for roasting or 
boiling. Either a sirloin, porterhouse, or tenderloin 
steak is most suitable for broiling, and it should be cut 
from one to two inches thick—two inches is better—to 
keep the meat juicy. Trim off the fat, wipe with a 
clean damp cloth, place in a heated wire broiler which 
has been greased to prevent sticking, and hold directly 
over a glowing bed of coals. A live fire is necessary, 
not one that has begun to cool. It is quite an art to 
7s
-P-A-G-E-98
78 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
prepare a fire for broiling that will keep clear and hot 
to the end of the process. No stint of oval is to be 
allowed for one hour at least before the fire is needed. 
It is a good plan to direct servants to see to it or to 
attend to it personally at twelve o’clock for one o'clock 
dinner, that the fire is clear at the bottom, that enough 
fresh coal has been put on, and that it is then allowed 
to burn by regalating the draughts so that it will be a 
bed of glowing coals when required. The steak should 
be turned five or six times during the first minute, that the outer sealing may be quickly done; then the 
broiler must be held farther away, and the meat fin- 
ished more slowly, turning at this stage once every 
half-minute until the meat is done. It should be pink 
and juicy inside, but not raw, as we so frequently find 
it when served as so-called rare meat in hotels or res- 
taurants.° Seven to ten minutes over a good fire will 
usually cook to perfection a steak from an inch and a 
half to two inches thick. Have the plate upon which 
it is to be served warm (not hot), season the meat with 
salt, and use care in handling it that the surface may 
not be broken and the juice lost. For wursery use, 
salt is the only condiment allowable. Never use melted ~butter on the meat j all the butter required by children 
should be taken as cold as possible upon the bread that is eaten, not upon meat or vegetables (except in cream 
sauce, as indicated elsewhere), if freedom from indiges- tion is desired. When broiling thin steaks, or a ten- derloin which may not be very juicy or of good flavor, 
it is a good plan to lay a thin piece of round steak upon both sides‘of the tenderloin before broiling, and thus get a delicious steak, discarding, of course, the
-P-A-G-E-99
BOILED MEATS. 79 
outer pieces, the juice of which has entered the middle 
steak. 
Scraped beef makes an acceptable change, either 
cooked or raw, when allowed by the family physician, 
and it may be used at an earlier age than meat is usually 
given. Use a thick cut from the tender part of the 
round or rump, scrape off the pulp with a silver knife, 
rejecting the tough fibre, and mould it into cakes 
about an inch thick; then broil on an oyster broiler 
as you would an ordinary steak. When for any rea- 
sou it is inconvenient or impossible to broil a steak or 
scraped meat, heat thoroughly a thick iron or steel 
pan, sprinkle salt over it to prevent sticking, and 
cook the meat in the same manner as if using a solid 
broiler, turning with a knife or spoon, not a fork, 
that no juice may escape. Turn quickly at first and 
have the pan scorching hot, then moderate the heat, 
and finish more slowly. Very good results may be 
obtained in this way. Do not put fat into the pan, as 
is so frequently done. 
The above directions apply as well to the broiling 
or panning of lamb- and mutton-chops, which should 
also be cut thick and be well trimmed. It requires 
from four to six minutes to cook 4 chop one inch thick. 
Mutton is supposed to be more easily digested than 
beef. It takes three hours to digest broiled beef-steak, 
three hours and a half for roast beef, and four for that 
which has been fried. The conclusion to be drawn is 
evident. 
BOILED MEATS. 
<_, When boiled meat is desired, use water that is boil- 
fs rapidly to seal the meat, as one of the first results —
-P-A-G-E-100
80 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
of putting meat into water that does not boil is that 
some of the valuable ingredients of the meat pass into 
the water. By having the water boiling rapidly this is prevented, and by continuing the boiling for five 
minutes the meat has a protective covering formed 
about it that keeps it juicy and nutritious. It should 
then be cooked at a considerably lower temperature, 
about 160° F. It may be a little higher, but should 
not be much less. This method applies to boiling 
poultry whole, as well as to beef, lamb, or mutton. 
‘When boiling beef, allow from twenty to forty min- utes to the pound, according to the quality of the beef. For a boiled leg of lamb or mutton allow 
fifteen minutes to the pound. Lamb is best when 
used within several days after killing, as it is in season 
after warm weather begins, from April to September, 
when it is difficult to keep it longer. Mutton may 
hang for three or four weeks in cold weather, and it will be improved by the hanging. 
; MEAT STEWS. 
A dainty and wholesome little meat stew may be le for the nursery as follows: Cut a tender piece of beef, lamb, or mutton into small squares, rejecting all fat; just cover it with boiling water and allow it to simmer until very tender, adding in the beginning either a bit of onion, a sprig of parsley, a stalk of celery, a few leaves of spinach, or a few small pieces 
of cauliflower, for flavoring, and add a very few small 
squares of potato; season with salt when nearly done. If the child for whom this is prepared likes the vege- tables mentioned, and is old enough, they may simply

be cut into small pieces ; if not, they should be pressed, 
when tender, through a purée sieve. Zwieback, broken 
into small pieces (mere crumbs), is a very nice addition 
to either a stew of this description or to the broths 
which frequently take the place of meat for very 
young children just beginning upon a mixed diet. A 
stew of this character, a dish of spaghetti, good bread 
and butter, and some light dessert, like cup custard, 
’ will make a satisfactory dinner menu for a four-year- 
old. The stew in this menu supplies the salt-giving 
' food required.

either beef, mutton, or fowl, see that the oven is very 
hot to begin with (in these days of ranges it is to be 
regretted that ovens must be used instead of spits), 
cooling it slightly after the sealing ot the surface has 
been done; then baste carefully, or use a double pan,

utes, using boiling salted water at first ; then cool and 
put away until needed. To complete cooking them 
for children, cut them into small squares and stew 
them carefully in a sauce prepared as follows: Rub 
a teaspoonful of good butter into a tablespoonful of 
flour, using one cup of milk or cream; heat the milk 
in a double boiler, add the thickening (stirring it in 
carefully), the sweetbreads, and a little salt. Stir con- 
tinuously until both sauce and sweetbreads are cooked, 
which will be in about fifteen minutes,—in ten if made 
in a single saucepan. The double one is preferable, 
as it prevents scorching. Any sauce containing milk 
and flour should be made in a double boiler or in a 
small saucepan fitted into the top of a teakettle. Care 
must be taken to cook the sweetbreads the required 
time only, as longer cooking is likely to harden them. 
ch peas, if tender, may be used with these for 
ildren over four when digestion is normal.” A little 
beef broth, sweetbreads, either prepared as above or 
broiled, with peas or stewed celery, bread and butter, 
boiled rice, and a simple dessert, would be a satisfac- 
tory menu for the age mentioned, and, with the ex~ 
ception of the peas, perhaps, it might be given at 
three and a half. under average conditions.

fectly fresh, as it is of great importance that stale eggs 
should not be used. A fresh egg will sink in salt water 
(one tablespoonful of salt to ten of water) and in pro- 
portion to its age it approaches the surface. Every 
woman thinks she can boil an egg, no matter how 
unskilled she may be in other branches of cooking, 
yet it is perhaps the least understood of all processes 
of making foods digestible by proper treatment. The 
usual method is to drop the egg in boiling water, which 
is allowed to continue boiling for two, three, or four 
minutes, according to the taste of the consumer. The 
result is either an almost raw egg or one with a hard 
white and uncooked yellow, and, generally speaking, 
the whole egg, when cooked in this way, is tough and 
indigestible, unless it is eaten almost raw. Sufficient 
boiling water (about a quart) should be set aside for a 
few moments, when it will be of the temperature re- 
quired. It should then be poured over several eggs in 
a good-sized saucepan, which should be covered and set 
back upon the range from eight to twelve minutes, ac- 
cording to whether they are liked very soft or not. 
These eggs are milky-looking, soft, cooked all the way 
through, and are easily digested. Dr. Thompson gives 
an excellent way for cooking eggs, as suggested by 
Henry.* Immerse a teacup in boiling water until it 
becomes thoroughly heated. It is then removed and 
the egg is broken and dropped into it, and the cup may _ 
be wrapped in acloth. Sufficient heat is retained by it 
to cook the egg without water and to remove any raw 
taste.

FISH. 
Fish, if fresh and of the right kind, is an exocllenb, 
food for the nursery. It is of great nutritive value, | 
and is Jess stimulating than meat.’ Being digested

”” yaairs to supplement a child’s dinner when fish is given 
instead of meat. Children who are unable to take 
much active exercise should have fish and broths more 
frequently than meat, as fish is especially indicated for 
persons of sedentary habits. 
Fish should be scaled and cleaned as soon as they 
come from market, washed quickly, and put in a cool 
place, not on ice, but near it if possible. The white- 
fleshed fish are the only kind to be considered in this 
connection, and the flesh should be firm and hard. If 
it is flabby it is unfit for use for child or adult, The 
German method of selling fish alive might well : introduced in this country.

utes, seasoned with salt, and added to the cream sauce 
mentioned. 
For broiling, turn the flesh side to the fire first, then 
the skin, taking care not to scorch the latter, which is 
very quickly done if care is not taken. 
OYSTERS. 
7 the soft part of oysters may be freely used in the 
nursery for children over three years of age. They 
are very nutritious, and are greatly desired as an ap- 
petizer and for variety. The soft part is easily di- 
gested and may be given raw to any child who takes 
meat and broths. ' The juice may be given earlier, in 
“giiall quantity, but it is a frequent occurrence for a 
child under five to refuse to eat oysters offered in any 
way, They are a very acceptable addition to an ordi- 
nary milk soup when chopped fine, after the hard part 
has been removed. Care must be exercised as to 
season; they are frequently placed upon the market 
before they are in good condition, and just as fre- 
quently they are kept for sale longer than is desirable. 
‘The season is supposed to be from September to April, 
but it is safer for children to consider it from October 
to March, unless cold weather has come early or con- 
tinues exceptionally late. Oysters should always be 
kept in the shell, in a cool place, until they are to be 
used.

the same way.

Inorganic Salts in Food. 
VEGETABLES. FRUIT. 
Common salt (chloride of sodium) is one of the 
most important ingredients of food, and its entire ab- 
sence would be speedily fatal. -\ It is the only condi- 
ment needed by children, and~ ‘they will occasionally 
like a little in the water which they drink, as it 
seems to stimulate a delicate appetite. Experimental 
results have shown its necessity inthe process of nu- 
trition. It certainly makes digestion easier by ren- 
dering foods savory, and consequently causing diges- 
tive juices to flow freely. It is in all foods, but.said 
not to be in sufficient quantity, therefore it must be 
added, especially to foods containing potash, as pota- 
toes, for instance. The reverse is also true, as in a 
salt meat dict scurvy develops unless potash is supplied 
in the form of potatoes, ete., but, as salt meat has no 
place in nursery diet, this is simply of interest in a 
general way. A young child who eats potatoes freely 
will frequently be found to crave large quantities of 
salt, and will often eat it surreptitiously, possibly much 
to the astonishment of its guardians. This points 
directly to reform in the child’s dietary. The desire 
will disappear if the use of potatoes is reasonably lim- 
ited. Potatoes should never predominate in nursery... 
menus ; 3 tice, macaroni, etc., should be used for variety.

Cow’s milk contains more potash than mother’s milk, 
which explains why food specialists advise the use of 
salt with cow’s milk. The relations of the different 
inorganic salts to one another in the nourishment of 
the child are of great importance, and it is a well- 
known rule in dietetics to supply them with great care. 
A farmer’s wife follows this principle when she gives 
young chickens the mineral salts they need in the form 
of oyster- and egg-shells or lime, but she may not no- 
tice that her child, from the lack of these same salts 
in its diet, is developing rickets,—a disease which Eus- 
tace Smith says is one of the most preventable yet one 
of the,most common. It appears among rich and poor, 
as a result of a poorly balanced dietary. Dr. Uffel- 
mann says,* “ Deficiency of inorganic salts in the food 
of growing children, easily overlooked by their ; 
dians, is a frightful source of nutritive disorder. 
ficiency of lime especially tends to result in rickets.” Eustace Smith says, “Rickets does not produce mal- 
nutrition, but malnutrition produces rickets.” As these 
remarks indicate, besides forming tissue, these salts 
are especially important in forming other teeth and 
bone, and an immense amount of the latter is formed 
during childhood. We are told that it is not until the 
end of the twelfth year that the cartilage entering into 
the formation of bone has become converted into true 
bone tissue, which fact will show to mothers the pre- 
eminent importance of supplying foods containing the 
required salts not only during the nursery period, but also during the following time, commonly called the eee

school period. Not only at this time, but even before 
the birth of a child his inheritance may be strength- 
ened by a suitable dietary for the expectant mother, 
which should contain a full supply of phosphates and 
the necessary constituents for a well-balanced dietary, 
as indicated elsewhere. Nature does not err. | Insti

course having been followed during the life of the 
parent—must show to mothers that the need is imper- 
ative for close study of domestic science as applied to 
this and other questions of similar import. Good 
habits of eating are easily established in the nursery 
by the use of tact and care, or by firmness, if necessary, 
but with a right beginning this is rarely necessary. 
The practical application of the use of foods con- 
taining salts is, as nature indicates, to give to a child 
for the first year, unless advised to the contrary by a 
reputable physician, milk properly modified, and milk 
only, which contains all the salts and other ingredients 
necessary for normal growth. As stated elsewhere, 
this is a law in France, made to prevent infant mor- 
tality. Then add cereals very gradually, and well- 
made bread, not supplying farinaceous foods to excess,

which is of too frequent occurrence, and one of the 
first stumbling-blocks when changing from milk to a 
mixed diet. Milk should still be the chief article of 
food until eggs, broths, meats, macaroni, vegetables, 
and fruits, following in their order, have taken the 
places indicated elsewhere in nursery dietaries. When 
changing from a milk diet containing salts to a mixed 
diet which shoud contain them, owing to lack of know]- 
édge, or perhaps of thought, the foods containing them 
(vegetables, fruits, etc.) are frequently omitted alto- 
gether, with the results enumerated above as a natural 
sequence (scurvy, ete.). It must never be forgotten-by 
mothers that salts are invaluable as adjuncts to a con- 
centrated diet] such as meat, eggs, etc., producing, in 
addition to their other functions, the necessary waste 
required for regular intestinal action. Their use in 
the order allowed in the nursery is fully indicated 
elsewhere, and practically illustrated in the selection 
of menus. Many. mothers will say, “But I don’t 
need any dietetic rules for my baby of eighteen months 
or two years, He eats everything and is quite well.” 
L, Emmett Holt, M.D., says he has had quite a large 
experience with those children who “ate everything” 
and seemed to relish it, and has followed a number 
of them to their graves as the ultimate result of such 
unreasonable and inconsiderate practice. 
THE USE OF VEGETABLES IN THE NURSERY. 
Spinach.—§pinach, which is a wholesome vegetable. when properly cooked, acts_as_a-useful aperient, and is frequently prescribed for habitual constipation. It should be well cleaned, cooked in an abundance of

salted. boiling water, and for young children pressed 
through a purée sieve. It may be served with or 
without a little cream. When prepared in this man- 
ner it will produce no irritation, and is a vegetable 
that may be used frequently in nursery menus, in 
broths, or alone. It may be used for children two and 
a half years old. 
Onions.—The onion is valuable in several ways. 
It adds flavor to foods, and is slightly laxative. The 
Freiich consider a purée of onions a great restorative 
in debility of digestion. Lither the Spanish or Ber- 
muda onion is preferable for the nursery. It should 
be boiled tender in stock or water and served with 
cream sauce, or baked, wrapped in a buttered paper, 
in a moderately heated oven. When made into a 
purée it is a satisfactory addition to a dinner con- 
sisting partly of starchy foods, like rice or potatoes, 
supplying the fat necessary for these vegetables in the 
butter added to the milk or cream in the sauce to be 
used with the purée. As onions belong to the variety 
of vegetables that contain little starch or sugar, a 
sweet: dessert, like wine jelly, should be used with any 
menu calling for this vegetable. They may be used 
with care for children over three, watching for indi- 
vidual idiosyncrasies. 
Celery.—Celery is both wholesome and. digestible 
if, io good condition. It may be eaten uncooked. by. 
children over six in very small quantities, as a single 
tender slip at dinner, and this well scraped, unless from 
the heart of the stalk. ‘The outer stalks should all be 
scraped, to free them from the indigestible covering of 
cellulose, or woody portion, which is harmful for even

an adult. For general use in the nursery it should be 
stewed. Care should be taken to use the water also in 
which the celery has been boiled. This may be done 
by giving it as a broth, or by using it in making the 
sauce to serve with the celery. 
Stewed Celery.—Cut off the tops of a bunch of 
celery; putting aside some of the tender and perfectly 
fresh portions for use for the general household. Cut 
the stalks into small pieces, first scraping them well. 
Boil quite tender in salted boiling water, just exough 
to cover the celery. It will take from twenty-five to 
thirty-five minutes over a quick fire. Serve plain, or 
with the usual cream sauce, made, however, from half 
celery water and half milk instead of all milk. Ex- 
perience will show that the tops usually require a 
longer time to cook than the stalks. For nursery diet 
the tender portions also should be used. The addition 
of a white stock would make a pleasant change, espe- 
cially if made of chicken, veal stock being not quite 
8o desirable for the nursery, Allowable at two and a 
half years of age, 
Cauliflower.—This vegetable is both delicate and 
digestible, and a tablespoonful may be eaten for dinner 
by a child over three years of age. It should be taken 
plain or with cream sauce, not with melted butter, which is never to be allowed on the nursery table. It is very nice when cut in pieces and stewed tender in beef stock or in chicken broth. Its preparatory cleansing must be very carefully done, a preliminary soaking, 
head down, being the first step. 
Garrote.—If very young and tender they may be 
used very carefully for a child over five. Boil them
-P-A-G-E-113
INORGANIC SALTS IN FOOD. 93 
soft enough to press through a purée sieve, and serve 
a small quantity in broth or seasoned with hot cream 
and salt. They may also be tried, but cautiously, 
when cut in very small squares, served plain or not, 
as preferred. 
Peas and Beans.—Dried peas may be used for 
children three to four years old if first soaked for 
twenty-four hours, cooked very soft, and pressed 
through a purée sieve. Fresh peas, if picked the 
day they are to be used, may be added to the dietary 
of a child of two and one-half years, but they should 
be very young and tender. They must be boiled 
rapidly from: ten to twenty minutes in boiling salted 
water—just enough to keep them from burning—in a 
closed granite saucepan, remembering that for all vege- 
table cooking, in fact for all cooking in the nursery, 
porcelain or granite utensils should be used inva- 
riably. 
Very young beans, or a purée of dried beans, may | 
be ttied cautiously for children over three. For best 
results both peas and beans, when fresh, should be 
cooked as soon as possible after picking. The use of 
these vegetables must be watched closely for indica- 
tions pointing to assimilation or non-assimilation. It 
must not be overlooked that they supply a moderate 
amount of proteids, hence less meat should be used 
with a menu containing either peas or beans. A 
practical method for trying a new vegetable is to re- 
serve its use for a time when the child is in perfect 
condition, digesting its food easily, and when the menu 
contains nothing but food that has been tried and found 
to agree. The chances are then that if any trouble
-P-A-G-E-114
94 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
arises it may be traced to the exact cause. Caution 
should always be the watchword in the nursery. 
_-fsparagus-—Asparagus possesses diuretic praper- 
_ ities, and is a vegetable strongly recommended fer nit 
sery use, especially when in season. For children, only 
the tips should be used, boiling them tender in boiling 
salted water, and serving either plain or with cream 
sauce. They may be used for children two and a half 
years old. 
Tomatoes.—Tomatoes are not to. be eaten when 
milk is in the dietary. If given at all, it should be 
after a child has reached five years. They should be 
cooked slowly for several hours in a porcelain or agate 
vessel, strained, and thickened with a little barley, 
wheat, or rice flour, or a few grated bread crumbs 
or grated biscuit. Season when preparing with 
sugar, salt, and a teaspoonful of onion juice. Raw 
tomatoes must be used very cautiously, and not until 
a child is five years old. The seeds and skin should 
be discarded and the tomato should be fresh-picked 
and just ripe. An under- or over-ripe tomato is dan- 
gerous food. Tomato jelly may be tried for chil- 
dren over three if made from strained cooked toma~ 
toes and gelatin, the latter to be used in the usual 
way. 
Beets.--Beet- root isa valuable vegetable, an- appe- 
tizer, and belongs to the class containing sugar. This 
knowledge_is of importence™fir “Selecting menus that 
should contain the proportionate amount of the neces-. 
sary constituents. It is not indigestible unless tough 
and stringy. Very young beets may be cooked tender 
in boiling salted water in less than an hour. Care 
 
-P-A-G-E-115
INORGANIC SALTS IN FOOD. 95 
must be taken to wash the root without bruising it, 
and to cut off the top at least an inch from the beet, as 
this will prevent the loss of the juice that is desirable. 
Serve plain, cut in dainty squares or slices. They may 
be added to the diet of a child five years old, with 
caution and moderation. 
Apple Sauce.—This really comes under fruits, but 
it may be given at dinner in place of a vegetable at 
those seasons of the year when young fresh vegetables | 
are difficult to find. It should be prepared very care- 
fully. As quickly as the apples are pared and cored 
they should be dropped into cold water to prevent dis- 
coloration. When ready for cooking, put them into a 
double boiler of agate or porcelain, an earthen jar set 
in a pot of water, or in a nursery cooker, and steam 
until tender, adding no water to the apples. When 
done, beat up with a silver fork or spoon, and add a 
little sugar and a little lemon juice if liked. . Cinna- 
mon, delicately sifted over the surface, is a pleasant 
addition. If preferred, the sauce may be made, if 
done carefully, in an agate saucepan, using just enough 
water to reach the top pieces of apple (do not cover 
them). If pressed through a purée sieve it should be 
of agate, as one of tin destroys the delicate flavor of 
the apple. This sauce may be given to a child after 
it is eighteen months old. : 
Brussels Sprouts.—Brussels sprouts, when very 
tender and perfectly fresh, may be carefully used after 
a child is six years old. They must be boiled ten- 
der in salted water, and served plain or with cream 
sauce. . 
Corn.—Corn for the nursery should always be used
-P-A-G-E-116
96 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
as a purée, or boiled on the cob in boiling salted water for ten minutes, the tender part to be pressed out with 
the back of a knife after scoring. This may be given 
to a child of three, as, being freed from its indigestible 
covering, it will not irritate. As the child grows older, 
the corn may be grated and served in the form of a 
corn pudding or omelet. 
There is probably no other rule so important for 
infant diet as that which regulates the amount of starch 
to be given toa child. Of the starchy foods allowed in the nursery for dinner, rice, potatoes, and macaroni 
are the most important. They are palatable foods and 
are easily digested if properly prepared and adminis- 
tered at the right age. 
Rice.—Rice_ is not. suitable in itself as a solefood. It is lacking in fat and salts, and is poor in nitrogenous 
substances, but the starch which it contains (its chief 
constituent) is easily digested, and it is, therefore, a 
very valuable food when mixed in proper proportions 
with articles of food that are rich in fat and albumi- 
noids. It should not be given freely to a child until 
after two and one-half years, using it in broths from 
eighteen months to this age. A very satisfactory way 
to prepare rice for children is to wash it well, soak it 
overnight in cold water, and boil rapidly in an abun- 
dance of boiling salted water for twenty minutes, The grains will swell, and they are easy to digest. If the preliminary soaking is overlooked, wash the grains well and drop them gradually into the boiling water, care being taken to keep the boiling continuous while 
this is done, and boil rapidiy for thirty minutes, stir- ring once or twice with a fork to keep the grains from

sticking to the bottom. When done, whichever method 
is followed, pour the rice into an agate sieve, let a 
quantity of hot water run through until it runs clear, 
and then set the sieve upon a plate in the oven until 
the rice is perfectly dry. This is a very good way to 
prepare it for breakfast for occasional use in place of 
oatmeal for the summer months, serving it with cream 
and a little sugar or salt as seems most advisable. 
Steaming is the method usually advocated for cooking 
rice. Inasmuch as the starch in rice is very easily 
digested, long cooking is not so necessary as when 
cooking oatmeal, etc. ; and as in selecting a child’s menu 
we do not depend upon the small amount of proteids 
found in rice (which are said to dissolve in boiling), 
the above method, judging by results, seems to be 
practically preferable, although steaming may be con- 
sidered so theoretically. 
Potatoes.—The potato is a salt-giving starch vege- 
table, to be.eaten with lean meats or other nitrogenous _. 
foods. It is three-quarters water, and prevents con- 
centration in food. The remaining quarter is nearly 
all starch. Care should be exercised in the selection 
of potatoes, those that are yellowish white being pre- 
ferred. The fact that it takes three and a half hours 
to digest boiled potatoes, and two hours for those that 
are properly baked, will indicate at once which method 
is preferable for the nursery. The desired temperature 
for cooking starchy foods can be reached in the oven 
with care, and a potato of medium size should be baked 
in from thirty to forty-five minutes. When donein this 
way, they may be given occasionally with dish gravy 
from roast beef, roast mutton, or broiled beefsteak, or 
a 9a.
-P-A-G-E-118
98 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
with salt and cream, to a child of eighteen months ; but 
it may be safer to wait a little while longer, according 
to the condition of the child. The potash in potato, 
which is an important salt and soluble in water, is not 
lost when potatoes are baked. ‘For this reason, when mashed potatoes are desired for children, they should 
either be steamed in a steamer or a closed colander 
placed over boiling water, or be boiled in the skin. 
When done, they should be lightly beaten with a fork, 
and a little cream and salt added. If properly cooked 
in this way a potato will assume a mealy or floury ap- 
pearance, and boiled potatoes should never be used in 
the nursery unless done in this way. 
Macaroni, etc.—Macaroni, spaghetti, and vermi- 
celli are all preparations of flour, supposed to be made 
from hard Italian wheat, rich in gluten. Sir Henry 
Thompson observes of macaroni, “It is certainly to 
be lamented that so little use is made in our country 
of Italian pastes. Macaroni in all its forms is, in 
fact, an aliment of very high nutritious power, being 
formed chiefly of gluten, the most valuable part of 
the wheat, from which the starch has been removed. 
Weight for weight it may be regarded as not less 
valuable for flesh-forming purposes in the animal 
economy than beef or mutton. Most people can di- gest it more easily and rapidly than meat ; it offers, therefore, an admirable substitute for meat, particu- 
larly for lunch or mid-day meals.” It must be selected with care, as there are many imitations in market which 
contain little gluten and much starch. To prepare it for the nursery add about ten sticks of macaroni broken into small pieces to a quart of boiling salted

water, dropping the pieces in one by one, that the 
water may continue boiling. Boil gently for twenty 
minutes, drain thoroughly, and put it back in the 
saucepan, adding cream or a pint of milk thickened 
with a teaspoonful of flour rubbed smooth in a tea- 
spoonful of butter, and allow it to simmer for another 
twenty minutes. Enough milk or cream’ shoud be 
allowed to cover the macaroni well when done with. 
the cream sauce which results from careful simmering. © 
Spaghetti may be prepared in the same way. Vermi- 
celli is to be used as an addition to broths, but there 
is no reason why it also should not be prepared, as 
directed above. 
If any of the vegetables mentioned disagree, upon 
careful. observation, with children possessing certain 
inherent peculiarities, their use should be postponed 
until after the second teeth have appeared. It is 
always advisable to watch for indications of habitual 
nonsassimilation of certain foods, and, if necessary, 
not to use them until later years, when a more liberal 
dietary in many respects may be allowed. 
Salads dressed with olive oil may be given after 
second dentition; the oil is a valuable nutrient, and 
the fresh green supplies an important part of a grow- 
ing girl’s or boy’s requirements. 
THE PLACE OF FRUIT IN THE NURSERY DIET 
The use of fruits in-nursery~ dietetics ‘is of the 
greatest importance. They contain a very large pro- 
portion of water, but {fier chief food value lies in 
the sugar, acids, and salts which they contain, which

100 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
testinal action, and correct tendencies to constipation. 
They are especially adapted to the nourishment of the 
brain and nervous system. 
The selection and use of fruit demand careful con- 
sideration, and it must be used moderately at all times, 
as any excess tends to intestinal irritation. The seeds, 
pulp, and| @llalar parts are usually the disturbing ele- 
ments. The juices are, as a rule, perfectly wholesome, 
and may be used S6tiie time before solid fruits may be 
given. The Laneet says, “Nothing is more essential 
to learning \than frequent reiteration. . .. It might 
be supposed that by this time every one understood 
» the importance of observing particular care in the se- 
lection of a summer dietary, especially as regards fruit. 
Hardly any question of domestic management is either 
more vital or more elementary, yet error continually 
arises in this connection in the simplest way. A few 
days ago a child died soon after eating strawberries. 
Why? Because the fruit had been purchased two days 
previously, and, as was only to be expected, when eaten, 
was in a state of decay. It is impossible to resist the 
impression that neglect had something to do with the 
sad result in this instance. Luscious fruits are partic- 
ularly Hable to putrefactive change, and such thrifty 
Processes a5 exposure to a cold and dry air, spreading out, and the like, suffice only to postpone decay for a 
brief period. We cannot do better than point to the incident above mentioned in order to remind the 
vender and purchaser alike that freshness is the only certain guarantee of safety when any succulent fruit forms an article of diet. We have not forgotten that 
another hardly less serious danger of the season awaits
-P-A-G-E-121
INORGANIO SALTS IN FOOD. 101 
those who indulge in fruit which is under-ripe. In 
this case taste as well as judgment commonly inter- 
poses a caution the importance of which can hardly 
be exaggerated. Yet here, also, the consequences of 
neglect have too often been sadly apparent.” 
As may be inferred from the above remarks, it.is-ef 
the first importance that fruits be fresh, ripe, and- in 
good condition. They must also be delicately handled, 
as their greatest value lies in the juice they contain, 
which may readily be lost in whole or in part by care- 
less handling. A child two and a half years old may 
usually be allowed the juice and pulp of a sweet ripe 
orange; no amount of sugar will correct the acidity 
of a sour orange, in a wholesome way, for nursery 
use. The juice of a sweet orange is indicated in 
feverish conditions, and it may be freely used under 
almost all circumstances after a mixed dietary has 
begun. It is well to remember in giving all fresh 
fruits that the best time is to give them for break- 
fast or for early dinner, as all fruit allowable for 
supper should be cooked. It should also be remem- 
bered that when fat and meat form a considerable 
portion of the menu, fresh fruit should be carefully 
given; therefore, in winter menus, when fat and meat 
are necessary for dinner, it is advisable to use fresh 
fruit for breakfast and puddings, etc., for dinner des- 
serts, In summer, when meat and fat should be 
sparingly used, fresh fruit may be given for both 
breakfast and dinner; never for supper at any season 
of the year. Baked apples may be used frequently 
after a child is two years old. Dr. Rotch says a 
baked apple may be given at the evening meal when a 
g*

102 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
child is fourteen to fifteen months old, or for variety 
the apple can be made into a simple sauce, never, how- 
ever, having the sauce made with much sugar. The 
pulp of a raw apple, scraped with a silver spoon or 
knife, may sometimes be given for breakfast. Apples, 
cooked or raw, are particularly useful with a concen- 
trated diet (beef broth, eggs, etc.), and if properly 
selected they are easily digested. As a rule, a child 
who is delicate and has little appetite for breakfast 
will rarely turn away from a juicy baked apple daintily 
served. For eating raw, a highly colored apple, with 
rosy, sugary flesh, is most digestible, if care is taken 
to see that it is properly masticated. Any really ripe 
apple may be used with safety if peeled and scraped. 
The juices of almost any fruit may be used at two and 
a half years, either as a drink or with the varieties 
of desserts or farinaceous foods allowed. Cherries, 
grapes, raspberries, strawberries, blackberries, pine- 
apples, and similar juicy fruits are suitable for this 
purpose. These juices may be prepared in the follow- 
ing manner, and possess the advantage of being ready 
for use at all seasons of the year. Express the clear 
juice of the fruit in the usual way, and boil it with a 
small quantity of sugar, about a quarter of a pound 
to a pint of juice. Boil fifteen minutes, stirring con- stantly, and skim as long as any scum arises. Then strain, put in bottles or jars, and seal. fie ne child is two and a half years old, stewed

quently much too concentrated or too starchy, keeping 
a child dull, sluggish, and unhappy. 
The following fruits may be used after three years 
and a half, according to the child’s power of digestion. 
Cranberries, which rank as an antiscorbutic and an 
astringent, may be given in the form of a sauceor & 
drink, They should be strained when used in the 
nursery. To make a cooling, refreshing drink, boil 
the berries in water double the measure of the berries. 
Boil until the juice has been thoroughly extracted, 
sweeten with one-half pound of sugar to a quart of 
juice, boil ten minutes, bottle, and seal while hot. 
This must be largely diluted. 
Strawberries are wholesome for nearly every one 
when fresh and ripe, if taken in moderation, but results 
must be carefully watched for individual idiosyncrasies. 
Some physicians recommend their use as early as two 
years and a half, but it is better to err on the safe side 
and “make haste slowly.” 
Dates and figs are highly nutritious, much more so 
than many other fruits, and in large quantities they are 
usually aperient. Children generally like dates when 
seeded, pressed flat, and served with a slice of buttered 
brown bread or saltine crackers. 
Bananas are nutritious, but indigestible unless very 
ripe, when they are nearly all sugar, and it may be as 
well to postpone their use until children reach six years 
of age. They should be well chewed. . 
In this connection it may be well to mention some 
uses to which bananas are put. While awaiting my 
turn in the office of a prominent New York physician 
for children one day, I saw a mother, with a child ap-
-P-A-G-E-124
104 HOW T0 FEED CHILDREN. 
parently two and a half years old, leave the house for 
a few moments, to get something, as she said, to quiet 
the child, who was crying. As she went out she re- 
marked to the servant at the door that she had brought 
the child to the physician because he wasn’t well,— 
wouldn’t eat. She returned in a few moments, and 
the child was eating a so-called “ripe” banana. The 
skin was green, I felt impelled to send word to the 
physician to this effect, as her turn preceded mine, but 
T did not do it, nor can I tell why. I think the hope- 
lessness of convincing such a mother prevented me, 
and both the child and the physician had my sym- pathy, for obvious reasons. 
I have seen children only two years old munching 
away contentedly at dead-ripe bananas. One was the 
child of an Italian fruit vender, and she was the pic- 
ture of health and content. Her mother assured me 
that the child ate them daily, and had never been ill. 
T questioned her closely, but could find no evidence of 
bad effects. The child was a sturdy little thing, and 
looked perfectly well. Reflection led me to believe 
that the secret of it all was that thrift would prevent 
her parents from giving her the sound bananas of 
market value, and the child was allowed to eat those 
only that were really ripe, and consequently she did 
not suffer as she would have done had they been other- wise. Really ripe bananas, being chiefly sugar, are 
easily digested, and under certain conditions are an excellent food. When not really ripe, they are ex- 
tremely indigestible. A ripe banana in the tropics is an entirely different fruit from the banana sold else- where as being ripe, To those mothers who insist upon
-P-A-G-E-125
INORGANIC SALTS IN FOOD. 105 
feeding their children upon green bananas, the above 
remarks may be of interest. 
Pears, when ripe, may be used carefully, but they are 
not'to be preferred to other fruit for the first five years, 
as, in the opinion of many, they require a long time 
for digestion, and being decidedly laxative, if not 
properly digested, they are likely to give trouble. 
Peaches may be used from eighteen months up, when 
fresh and ripe and prepared carefully,—that is, pared 
immediately before eating. Dr. Rotch says a ripe 
peach, when in season, may often be given with benefit 
during the second year, especially if the infant is in- 
clined to be constipated. They should always be pared 
for nursery use, as should every skin fruit, like the 
pear, apple, plum, etc. They must also be thoroughly 
washed before using. Diphtheria has been known to 
be carried by unwashed apples, and even if no con- 
tagion exists there is something decidedly unpleasant 
in the thought of eating fruit that has been handled 
constantly by unwashed hands from the time of pick- 
ing, through transit, until it reaches the table. Even 
dates and figs suffer no appreciable loss by being 
quickly but carefully washed and dried over a range 
or in the sun, and they are infinitely more appetizing 
when treated in this way. Sterilized or boiled water 
should always be used for this purpose. 
Grapes occupy an intermediary position, and may be 
used medicinally in many cases, under the guidance, 
however, of aphysician. They.are very rich in sugary 
both in the fresh and in the dried form (raisins), and are 
easily digested when fally ripe. They are particularly 
useful in convalescence and in anemic and catarrhal
-P-A-G-E-126
106 HOW T0 FEED CHILDREN. 
conditions. The skins and seeds of all grapes must be 
rejected ; the pulp, also, of many of them, chiefly on 
account of the seeds they contain. The pulpof Tokay, 
Malaga, and similar grapes may be eaten freely. Grape 
juice is especially refreshing, and is liked by all chil- 
dren. It may be given among the first fruit juices 
allowed. A pleasant way ¢o prepare grape juice for 
young children is to use a fruit-press (a press that 
is used for mashing potatoes will answer very well), 
putting pulp, skin, and all into it and expressing the 
juice, which may be given clear or diluted for dessert 
or as a cooling drink in hot weather whenever and in 
whatever quantity desired. In this way some of the 
valuable ingredients of fruit may be added to a child’s 
dietary long before the use of solid fruit is allowed. 
The use of these fruit juices corresponds, in the order 
of the menus indicated, to the use of the vegetable 
waters spoken of when making meat broths, which may 
also be used. before even vegetable purées are allowed. 
Blackberries are an astringent fruit, and theymust__ 
be perfectly ripéto be eaten in their natural state. 
The usual blackberry in market is unripe, although 
black, and is unfit for food unless cooked. The berries 
are not sweet when in this condition, and if eaten they 
will easily cause a period of indigestion. A very good 
jelly may be made by using gelatin soaked in black- berry juice instead of cold water, in the proportion of 
a box of gelatin to a pint of juice, adding one cup of sugar and three cups of boiling water. Boil, strain, 
cool, and keep in covered jars or tumblers. This 
wethod, with the variations called for by the different fruits in the way of sugar, flavoring, ete., will be found
-P-A-G-E-127
INORGANIC SALTS IN FOOD. 107 
an excellent one for the use of all fruits. Cherries, 
pineapples, prunes, oranges, apples, grapes, raspberries, 
currants, and rhubarb are all to be recommended in 
this form. A further variation may be made at any 
time by adding the whites of eggs in proportion to the 
quantity made (as, for instance, two to four whites to 
one box of gelatin), beating the whites stiff, and whip- 
ping them into the fruit jelly a little at a time before it is 
quite firm. This may be eaten plain or with sweet cream. 
Corn starch and blanc-mange may be varied by cook- 
ing them with fruit juices instead of milk, to be served 
with milk or cream. 
The white of egg beaten very stiff and slightly 
sweetened, or whipped cream, either of them to be 
used with the addition of fruit or fruit jelly, is a 
dessert that is simple, easily made, and one that. not 
only pleases the eye and palate, but possesses desirable 
nutriment as well. 
Whilst the selection of a fruit or fruit dessert may 
seem the least important portion of the nursery menu, 
it does not occupy this position, as, if used at all, it 
must be considered in connection with the idea carried 
out in selecting the entire menu for the meal. We 
must always remember the rules to be followed in 
health in regard to proportionate quantities of food 
containing albuminoids, starches, fats, and sugars,—one 
supplementing the other. Under other conditions than 
those of health an entirely different plan must be fol- 
lowed, as special conditions call for specially directed 
nutrients, and at such times fruits and vegetables are 
not desirable, unless recommended by some one of un- 
questionable authority,—i.e., the family physician.

CHAPTER VII 
Laxative Foods. 
THERE is a constant demand among mothers for 
authoritative knowledge concerning the laxative foods 
and medicines that may be safely used in the nursery, 
and of methods that are calculated to relieve the actual 
state of constipation. One mother writes that she 
gives to her child a teaspoonful of castor oil every day 
with no permanent relief whatever, a result to have 
been expected, although she did not know it. A safe 
rule to follow in regard to castor oil is to give it only 
when it appears to be positively necessary to cleanse the . 
intestinal tract of matter that is dangerous,‘as in cases 
of severe diarrhea, cholera infantum, etc. It is then 
in all probability the first thing to do, but it should 
even then be given under a competent physician’s direc- 
tions if possible, and be purchased at a reputable phar- 
macist’s. (The prevalent abuse of laxative medicines 
cannot be much deplored and inveighed against. 
Let.mothers first watch the food of their children ; then 
see if it.is assimilated, and if not, try to make it so by constant care and supervision. Experience will soon 
educate any ordinarily intelligent woman sufficiently to show her whether her child’s food is being properly digested or not. If food is too concentrated, as in a 
milk, meat, or egg diet, there is little waste. This is
-P-A-G-E-129
LAXATIVE FOODS. 109 
a frequent cause of constipation. \By supplying the 
bulk in food required by the use of tereals, vegetables, 
and fruits, as indicated in dietaries, with a sufficiency 
of water to drink, this condition can usually be cor- 
rected. “Use water freely, internally as well as exter- 
nally, “Keep the children regular as to time for stool, and 
the ery for laxative medicines for nursery use will in 
all probability become a thing of the past. Nature 
has provided sufficient in food to prevent trouble in 
this direction; why not take advantage of the fact? 
Directions are frequently given very generally with 
no specific statement as to just what is to be done. 
Let mothers who have constipated children study lists 
of foods advised in well-known dietaries, and remem- 
ber always that bulk in food, water,—an abundance | 
of water,—and massage at the same hour every day 
(rubbing the abdomen gently for five minutes with 
the palm of the hand, using about a teaspoonful of 
_ warm olive oil) will frequently cure the most stubborn _| 
case of constipation. 
Foods that are decidedly laxative and allowable for 
children are ripe peaches, stewed rhubarb, stewed or 
dried prunes, figs, dates, oranges, apples, oatmeal por- 
ridge, bran mush, Indian meal mush, whole meal 
bread, rye and Graham bread, all cereals made of the 
whole grain, tomatoes, spinach, boiled Spanish onions, 
etc. Dr. Thompson * says constipation may result 
from. one or. more of the following causes, which are* 
related to diet: 
1. Insufficient quantity of solid food. 
  * Practical Dietetics. j
-P-A-G-E-130
110 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
. Too highly nutritious or concentrated food. 
. Insufficient fluid. 
. Astringent food and drinks. 
. Indigestible food. 
- Lack of digestive fluids. 
. Irregularity in diet. 
Obstruction from overeating, especially in chil- aaa Ppwn 
dren. 
9. Lack of peristalsis (movement of the intestinal 
wall). 
10. Lack of exercise. 
All vegetable and cereal foods, by supplying bulk, 
vegetable acids, and salts, help to correct this ten- 
dency. He advises the early use of fruits as whole- 
some and highly beneficial if taken in moderation, 
and he says that cooked fruits may be eaten with any 
meal, but when fruit is eaten for special dietetic pur- 
poses its effect is generally more pronounced if taken 
alone. Children should take it at the commencement 
of meals, or about half an hour before breakfast, with 
a glass of water. When used in this way the effect 
upon the bowels is more marked. Prunes, being de- 
cidedly laxative, may be used advantageously two or 
three times a day to correct a sluggish condition, giving 
but a few ata time, either dried, stewed, or freshened 
as directed in another chapter. Care should be exer- cised in selection, the largest fruit being the most de- 
sirable for several reasons, one of which is cleanliness, 
as any experienced housekeeper knows. , Figs are also decidedly laxative, and if taken before break fast, either stewed or plain, will often cure constipation. 
“ Molasses and honey added to bread are laxative.
-P-A-G-E-131
LAXATIVE FOODS. lit 
“Gingerbread, especially for children, is sometimes 
efficacious. 
“Grape juice is somewhat laxative. 
“ Olive oil or cod-liver oil, if taken at bedtime into 
an empty stomach, is laxative for some persons, espe- 
cially children. 
“With many persons having imperfect digestion 
raw fruits disagree, and since their laxative properties 
are not much weakened by being cooked, it is better to 
eat them in that form. 
“ A few fruits, like the banana, are apt to cause con- 
stipation. . 
“ Owing to the prevalent idea that fresh fruit relieves 
constipation, patients occasionally eat too much of it, 
with the result of producing dyspepsia, and increasing 
their original trouble.” 
Laxatives should be given to the mother when con- 
stipation in herself causes this habit in nursing infants. 
Water may be given to the infant as an aid. 
Copious draughts of water are most important aids. 
If taken slowly, water may be taken in moderation 
with meals, and a sufficient quantity should also be 
given between meals, before breakfast and after supper. 
It seems to be a difficult thing to impress sufficiently 
upon those in charge of children the importance of the 
use of water. In one instance brought to the writer's 
notice, a physician was hurriedly called ten miles away 
at midnight to see an infant that was apparently very 
ill. He suggested giving the child some water to drink, 
which was done. The child slept, and there was no 
further difficulty. The mother said her physician had 
never even hinted at the necessity for giving an infant
-P-A-G-E-132
112 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
water. This may seem incredible, but it is only too 
true that cases of this kind occur constantly. The 
physician takes it for granted that the mother’s com- 
mon sense would suggest the use of water to drink 
from the beginning, and, on the other hand, the mother 
waits for specific directions in every detail, and fre- 
quently follows only those that suit her convenience. 
One very hot day in July, when passing through New 
York, I met a mother with a erying baby, fifteen days 
old, upon an open street car. The child was simply 
suffocated. It had a veil over its face, a wool coat 
and cap, and an unbearable amount of other clothing 
upon its poor little body. I ventured to suggest to the 
mother that the child was crying from the heat. She 
looked surprised, said she feared it would catch cold, 
but she acted on the suggestion, took off the veil, un- 
buttoned the coat, removed the sleeves from the child’s 
arms, and untied the cap. The child was quiet at 
once. I then asked her if she gave the baby water to 
drink. She looked surprised again, and said no. I 
told her a few simple things necessary for baby’s com- 
fort, and, saying, “That is good to know,” she thanked 
me. so gratefully that I became more than ever con- 
vineed that many mothers would do better if things 
were made more simple for them, that they might un- 
derstand more readily without the mental effort to 
which many are unaccustomed. 
Dr. Alfred K. Hills * says that water not only helps 
to clean the stomach of its contents and aid in the di- 
gestion of food, but when taken up by the blood- aa 
* New York Medical Times.
-P-A-G-E-133
LAXATIVE FOODS. 113 
vessels aids in normal nutrition, removes effete matter, 
and relievescongestion. He says the refreshing draught 
of fresh, cool water should not be withheld from pa- 
tients; that it should be constantly offered to them ; 
that in acute catarrh of the stomach there is no agent 
which gives so prompt and durable relief as water, 
sipped as hot as it can be borne. Many cases of dis- 
ordered digestion are due entirely to lack of sufficient 
water. A baby should be offered water six or seven 
times a day. For older children, it should be remem- 
bered that water is needed according to activity and to 
bodily temperature,—the greater the activity the greater 
the need for water. . 
A child weighing forty pounds should drink at least 
twenty ounces of water a day, and hot weather calls for 
more. Let every mother impress thoroughly upon her 
mind the fact that if her child becomes constipated, 
she should endeavor first to correct the trouble by the 
methods indicated above, with the use of massage at a 
regular hour every day, and if necessary a daily enema 
of warm water containing a little salt, before flying to 
the relief offered by preparations that claim to be effi- 
cacious under all circumstances and conditions. A 
very forcible illustration of the inefficiency of so-called 
laxatives is brought to my mind in the case of a child 
who was treated medically for more than a year for 
what appeared to be stubborn constipation. It ran the 
gamut of all the best medicaments to be had, with no 
permanent relief. The mother eventually, in despair, 
abandoned all medicinal treatment, gave a daily enema 
of salt and water, daily massage at a regular hour, in- 
sisted upon a regular time for stool, saw to it person-

ally that the child had a bountiful supply of drinking 
water and laxative foods, such as are indicated, with 
the result of correcting a habit that never returned, 
and that at one time caused grave apprehension both 
upon the part of the mother and physician, whose re- 
liance upon medicine instead of dietetics and hygiene 
evidently caused all the trouble.
-P-A-G-E-135
CHAPTER VIII. 
Nursery Desserts. 
Dr. Urre_mann says that in constructing the diet 
of the child it is important to remember at the outset 
that it requires much less variety of food than do grown 
persons. No sweets or other delicacies aré required to 
gratify the palate. The child at the breast receives the 
same food day after day, and only one sweet,—sugar. 
Children two or three years old thrive on a uniform 
fare of milk, bread, and meal, and the pleasures of the 
table do not agree with them. Dr. Mary Putnam 
Jacobi says these pleasures are not appreciated until 
much later in life. 
Mothers, however, for varying causes, frequently 
meet with the difficulty of catering to a capricious ap- 
petite, the desire for change of foods, etc.; therefore 
‘ fa simple dessert will tempt a child to eat a suffi- 
cient meal, it should, no doubt, be given, as with care 
‘it may be made to contain a large proportion of the 
putriment required for each meal, and prove a valua- 
ble supplement to a child’s menu. In reply to a query 
Gerning ice cream for children, Dr. Yale says * that 
a great distinction is to be made between those who 
can and those who cannot eat sweets. He says, “There 
is a very large class of people who cannot safely eat

* Nursery Problems.

116 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
much of certain things (sweets, starchy food, jncluding 
bread, potatoes, and many others seemingly harm- 
less) without sooner or later suffering for it in some 
way. This group of persons are called the gouty. 
They are relatively more abundant among the head 
workers than the hand workers. The offspring of such 
persons early show this inability to dispose properly 
of sweets, and to such children even ice cream is not 
harmless. It is a natural desire to give pleasure to 
our children in simple gratification of their palates, 
and the rule we give to those asking advice is, ‘See 
that the ice cream is of a really simple kind; give 
it in small quantities at rare intervals, say at Sunday 
dinner or some other easily remembered time; watch 
to see if the next two or three days are as free from 
indigestion or from fretfulness as other days, and from 
other evidences of disorder.’ We speak at length re- 
garding the ice cream because this involves the whole 
principle of sweet eating.” ‘ 
We quote at length from the same practical stand- 
point. If no sign of indigestion, such as acidity or 
flatulence, follows the moderate use of sweets within 
two or three days, they are harmless. Let it be noted 
that the mischief from sweets is not immediately ob- 
served. 
   
   It must never be forgotten in the application of food 
] rinciples that the chief value of food lies in its digesti-. . 
lity, not in what it contains; hence the need for careful observation of individual idiosyncrasies. It is impossible to give specific directions in any connection 
that would suit every case. Suggestions only can be given, and the intelligent mother will, in following
-P-A-G-E-137
NURSERY DESSERTS. 117 
them up, be able to detect needs she might not other- 
wise have noted, and will also be able to supply them. 
The following recipes have been tested, and may be 
used for any child in fair health, as soon as simple 
desserts are ordinarily allowed, which, under average 
conditions, is after two or two and a half years. For 
the earlier desserts, fruit juices, which are among the 
first to be given, have already been discussed. 
JUNKET AND CUSTARDS. 
/Sonket, made with essence of pepsin (Fairchild’s), is 
one of the first solid desserts to be recommended, and 
inmay be given at eighteen months, as it contains a 
large amount of nutriment, is easily digested, and is 
usually very acceptable. It can be varied for later 
years in several ways,—by the use of beaten raw egg 
stirred in the milk, or by using any flavor that is not 
acid. A baked apple is also one of the first desserts 
allowed.” A sound ripe apple baked properly is an 
easily digested delicacy, taking but an hour and a half 
for preparation in the stomach for assimilation. It is 
nourishing, a stimulant, and altogether a food to be 
commended for nursery use, and it may be used as 
one of the first important changes when making addi- 
tions to a child’s dietary of milk and cereals. As 
stated elsewhere, Dr. Rotch allows it to be used from 
the fourteenth to the fifteenth month. 
A very satisfactory way to bake an apple for nursery 
use is to peel and core it carefully, pour a cup of cold 
water over it, sprinkle lightly with sugar, cover closely, 
and bake until tender in a moderate oven. If carefully 
done, it should be as juicy and soft as jelly.
-P-A-G-E-138
118 HOW T0 FEED CHILDREN. 
Among, the lighter desserts are whipped cream and 
soft custards. These are easily prepared, and give 
~ sufficient variety until a child is three years old, when ice cream, rice pudding, orange float, tapioca, farina, 
and the various milk puddings may follow in their 
order. 
The chief point to remember in the selection of des- 
serts is that when the child has a full menu for the 
earlier part of the dinner—e.g., meat or broth, one 
cereal (rice), one juicy vegetable (purée of spinach), 
and bread and butter—a fruit or a light dessert is called 
for. But when for unavoidable reasons the main part 
of the dinner is light, as, for instance, bread and butter 
and beef broth, a substantial dessert should be chosen, 
—1.e., rice or tapioca pudding, milk jelly or cup custard, 
all of which contain the constituents of a varied diet, 
and thus supplement what would otherwise be an in- 
sufficient meal, When carrying out this idea, eggs 
should be added to the milk puddings, omitting them 
when lighter desserts are needed. 
Soft or cup custards may be made white or yellow 
by using or omitting half of the egg. They may also 
be colored and flavored with fruit juices, as cherry, 
prune, raspberry, etc. The proportions for a white 
cup custard would be the whites of three eggs to a 
pint of milk, and one or two whole eggs for the yellow for the same quantity of milk. When using fruit 
juices for custards take less milk in proportion to the 
quantity of juice used. Always use hot milk when adding the sugar and salt, and for a soft custard stir in a Gouble pan or boiler until it thickens, using more milk than ig called for in a recipe for cup custard. A
-P-A-G-E-139
NURSERY DESSERTS. 119 
soft custard should boil three minutes. A cup custard 
should be poured into cups, set in a pan of hot water, 
and baked twenty minutes in a hot oven. 
Gelatin may be used in the nursery in a variety of 
ways,. Dissolve one-half box in one pint of water, 
one-half cup of sugar, and one-quarter pint of fruit 
juice, using lemon and orange, currant juice and lemon, 
prune juice (one pound of prunes to a quart of water 
boiled to a syrup), grape juice, blackberry syrup, or 
one made from cranberries, remembering the astringent 
properties of both blackberries and cranberries and 
the laxative quality of prunes. Boil the mixture, with 
whatever flavor, strain and cool on ice—covered, as 
gelatin readily absorbs germs, odors, etc. 
on jelly made according to these directions, fla- 
vored with orange, vanilla, or lemon, and whipped with 
cream before it is quite firm, is a delicate and appetizing 
dessert. 
Whipped. cream flavored with prune juice, or with 
a small quantity of dry cocoa, is another dainty dessert. 
Grape sauce, or jelly made with gelatin, is espe- 
cially refreshing to convalescents. 
A simple fruit jam, made without the seeds or skins 
of the fruit, may be used occasionally with bread and 
butter for children over three years of age. 
As mentioned before, these desserts can be easily 
made by any plain cook. The value of the sugges- 
tions lies in the variety that may be given to two 
seemingly conventional desserts,—custard and gelatin. 
Milk puddings may be equally varied by using a 
little judgment, a little experimenting, and by choosing 
simple, sweet ingredients, such as tapioca with fruit,
-P-A-G-E-140
120 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
Yice with or without eggs, barley flour with orange 
flavoring, bread crumbs or bread soaked in milk with 
chocolate or apple and eggs added, ete. 
Trish moss, dissolved and used with corn starch, 
made into blanc-mange is a pleasant change. Add 
chocolate to the ordinary recipe for blanc-mange, and 
serve with sweet cream, for another variation. 
Milk jelly is the only dessert mentioned that may 
not be generally known. It is said to be retained by 
the most sensitive stomach, and will nourish when 
almost nothing else will be tolerated. 
Heat one quart of milk, then add and stir until 
dissolved one pound of granulated sugar; add an 
ounce of gelatin dissolved, and allow the mixture to 
boil for ten minutes. Before straining and cooling, 
add the juice of three lemons or any flavoring desired. 
Pour into cups, cover, and keep in a cool place. 
With the varieties suggested, and the long list of 
stewed fruits and fruit juices that may be used, it 
seems incredible that mothers will persist in feeding 
their little darlings with sweetmeats, doughnuts, cookies, 
heavy rich cakes, preserves, and canned fruits, even, 
as the writer has seen, going so far as to give them 
tea and coffee, with no consideration whatever for the 
delicacy cf the child’s digestion.
-P-A-G-E-141
CHAPTER IX. 
Summer Diet. 
Am this season of the year, if at no other, should 
excellence in the preparation of simple foods be the 
. Tule, more especially for the use of children. Elabora- 
tion should give way to simplicity ; indeed, in the nur- 
sery elaboration should never appear. A steak or a 
chop perfectly broiled, well-baked bread, pure milk, 
heated or modified as required, carefully selected fruit, 
- vegetables that are well chosen and properly prepared, 
and the avoidance of sweets and pastry, will prove 
potent factors in carrying a flock of little ones safely 
through the hot months of July and August. As I 
have frequently said, too much attention cannot. be 
given to the care of milk, heating at.107°-E.-being the 
only safe plan, and one not to be lightly set aside from 
considerations of convenience. This is imperative for 
nursery health when the ordinary milk-supply must be 
depended upon, as scarcely a month passes that we do 
not hear of an outbreak of diphtheria, typhoid or 
scarlet fever, etc. It is not imperative when certified 
milk or other really pure milk can be procured. If 
in doubt about the milk supply, follow a physician’s 
advice in regard to the heating process, in order that 
the milk which is or should be the base of the greater 
portion of nursery food may be sweet and safe to use 
for a child of any age. 
Proper preparation of ilk j is equally important at
-P-A-G-E-142
122 HOW T0 FEED CHILDREN. 
this period. It will not do to risk the dangers of 
cholera infantum by lack of care in this direction. 
The basis of human milk must be reached in some 
way for very young children. Analyses have shown 
how this can be done, and there is no longer any reason 
why an infant’s chances of death in summer should be 
80 great as they have been. 
Physicians may now be found in every direction who 
pay especial attention to children’s diet, and who will 
gladly show any mother how she may safely reach the 
basis of human milk. It is to her discredit if she does 
not take advantage of this fact, notwithstanding the 
usual advisory remarks of her neighbor as to giving baby 
undiluted cow’s milk, etc., because she did and because 
her mother had done so before her. Such an adviser 
never mentions the periodical attacks of indigestion 
constantly met with, especially during the much-dreaded 
and taken-for-granted second summer, which need not 
be the bugbear it is if attention be given to an infant’s 
needs in regard to pure and properly prepared milk and 
other foods, to hygiene, and the use of sufficient water. 
It seems necessary to iterate and reiterate the facts con- 
nected with the use of water in infant feeding, as it isa 
feature that is too frequently underestimated. (Many a 
child’s suffering has been relieved by a few teaspoonfuls 
of boiled water that has been cooled (not iced), and 
given at frequent intervals during a hot day} This 
should be the rule, not the exception, from birth. Chil- dren a few years old need a great deal more; a pint a 
day is not too much for a five-year-old child, and 
during very hot weather, when perspiration is excessive, the need is even greater.

(child is overfed if it cannot digest its food > hence if 
there is trouble of this kind either the food should be 
changed, or the child should not be fed at all for a short 
time, according to its condition. Frequently, after a 
meal has been omitted and a concentrated, easily assim- 
ilable food been given instead, as, for instance, a cup of 
peptonized milk, all signs of trouble will vanish. The 
use of this milk in summer must be emphasized, for many 
reasons, It may not be possible to procure laboratory 
. Afiilk ; the Fairchild process is easy, and for convales- 
cents and ailing children it isan invaluable aid. There 
is every reason in favor of its use for infants who must 
be fed artificially from birth, when laboratory milk pre- 
scribed by a physician is not to be had, as it resembles 
very closely the natural food of which the child has been 
deprived, and it does away entirely with the use of the 
pernicious, starchy, so-called infant foods that flood the 
market. (The approach of warm weather always brings 
to the thoughtful mother the consciousness of increased a Another point to remember at this tl is that a 
care) as this is the season requiring the exercise of much 
f forethought in regard to the diet of the little ones. 
This is particularly true in regard to food for older 
children in the summer-time, a trying period for the” 
one who provides, not so much in finding variety, 
asin being able to make the proper selections from 
the tempting supply of fresh fruits and vegetables 
offered, and in discarding the foods that are unsuitable 
for the hot months. Oatmeal, the reliance of many for 
breakfast in winter, must now be frequently discarded, 
as it often proves too heating. It may occasionally 
be used, however, in the form of oat jelly for children

124 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
who are very fond of oatmeal, as some will not eat 
hominy or wheat. The latter is a perfect summer 
cereal if well cooked, and efforts should be made to 
teach children to eat it by preparing it in an appetizing 
manner, serving it daintily, ete. As eggs may be used 
but two or three times a week, the breakfast menu in 
summer taken all together is the first: stumbling-block, 
and one likely to give trouble if not considered care- 
fully. Almost all children, especially those of a ner- 
vous temperament or an anemic type, are better for 
having had a hearty breakfast and one of sufficient 
variety to tempt the appetite. If mothers will step out 
of the beaten track and provide dainty dishes that are 
not looked for at this hour, they will be surprised to see 
how quickly their efforts will be appreciated. In sea- 
son, for children over five, a few sound, perfectly ripe 
strawberries (only four or five), with the hulls on,—the 
berries should be sweet enough to eat without sugar,— 
or half a dozen large cherries (oxhearts), perfectly ripe, 
laid upon the fruit-plate for the beginning of the meal, 
followed by dainty slices of well-baked, whole-meal 
bread and butter, and half a dozen asparagus tops that 
have been boiled tender in salted water, with a glass of 
cold or warm beef tea as preferred, anda spoonful of 
well-boiled and well-seasoned rice, will make a most 
satisfying and appetizing variation from the usual menu 
of eggs, oatmeal, potatoes, etc., and it will be one that a child will be sure to enjoy. 
Dainty serving is one of the most important ad- 
juncts in nursery feeding.) If the fancy of a child is pleased, he will, in all probability, eat most heartily. 
On a very hot morning I frequently find that I can

invite sufficient appetite by building engines or toy 
houses, ete., of small pieces of bread, well buttered 
with old butter. A little lump of butter is placed on 
each piece of bread, not spread on in the usual nursery 
style, which, to say the least, is not inviting; a very 
few crisp bits of fat broiled bacon may here and there 
take the place of butter. This may all be put upon 
a decorated plate to suggest a story to the child. I 
have often seen a delicate child, one of the kind who 
would rather play than eat, take unconsciously a satis- 
factory meal while he was being entertained with an in- 
teresting story about a dear little cherub on his plate who 
was pictured as eating an apple. I have seen this same 
child drink glass after glass of milk when it was served 
in a wineglass with a stem, whereas he would invari- 
ably refuse milk if it was given in a cup or a tumbler, 
saying he was not hungry. There is a fitness of things 
that must be considered when feeding children, and at 
no time is it more necessary than in summer, when the 
intense heat tries the temper even of adults, who are 
certainly more resistant than children to the various 
climatic changes to which we are usually subjected.

as to the appetite, of a fretful child who has probably 
been awakened too early by the heat, or who has passed 
a restless night for the same reason, than the sight of 
a prettily laid breakfast table,—flowers, fruits, and 
some little surprise at his plate to charm away his 
languor? A dish of cold snow pudding, which con-

tains ingredients that are all beneficial for a child 
(gelatin, ,eges, fruit juice, etc.), will work like a 
charm. {A glass of milk and a few dainty fingers of 
bread and butter will complete a satisfactory breakfast 
for hot weather? It is well to remember in shidsum- 
mer-time that a light early breakfast is preferable to a 
heavy later one, if it is supplemented by a glass of 
milk or of beef tea, with a few biscuits or a piece of 
zwieback, to be given midway between breakfast and 
dinner. Beef broth or cocoa should be given instead 
of milk to drink when cherries or strawberries are 
taken at breakfast. When cherrics are given, they 
must be in perfect condition, and results must be care- 
fully noted. Unless stewed, they are frequently not a 
safe fruit until after second dentition. 
Tapioca is of great value in summer diet, It may 
be used in a variety of ways for any meal in the day, 
either for dinner dessert or for the main portion of the 
breakfast or supper meal. 
urin ig very. hot weather meat should be sparingly 
used ; broths, eggs, milk, and macaroni should take its 
Place. Baked potatoes and rice are preferable for 
starchy foods at this season. Rice possesses no fat, and 
potatoes are nearly all water. 
Great care is. necessary to cook potatoes properly, 
As stated before, they should be baked in a very hot oven, one that is hot enough to bake a potato of mod- erate size in half an hour if possible. Rice also should be subjected to steady rapid boiling for thirty minutes, then treated as directed on page 94, so that each grain may be double its first size and distinct from every 
other. The pasty concoction served frequently to chil-

dren as boiled or steamed rice is an abomination, and 
not to be tolerated in any well-regulated nursery. 
For dinner menus in summer use well-made.broths. 
and soups, an occasional chop, a tablespoonful of scraped 
beef pulp that has been lightly broiled, or a piece of fish, 
broiled, boiled, baked, or creamed, never fried, prefer- 
ably broiled, remembering to give broths and fish more 
frequently than meat, and using well-boiled macaroni 
or spaghetti with a dinner menu that is minus meat, 
and rice and potatoes with broths and fish. Fish,.to. 
be useful in the nursery, as stated elsewhere, must be 
fresh and of the right kind. Being Jess stimulating 
and more easily digested than meat, it may be used 
frequently during summer. Only the white-fleshed fish 
should be used, and the flesh should be firm and hard. 
For variety, it may sometimes be creamed as directed on 
page 82, and served with white sauce in which beaten 
egg has been stirred. A piece of broiled or creamed 
fish with good bread and butter, a little honey, and a 
glass of milk will make a satisfactory and easily pre- 
pared dinner for a hot day, supplying every constituent 
that is needed. Another equally desirable, easily pre- 
pared summer menu is a spoonful of broiled scraped 
beef, with steamed or boiled rice over which a fruit 
juice or a vegetable sauce or purée has been poured. 
This, with bread and butter, will give a very simple yet 
satisfactory meal. Children frequently enjoy having 
only one or two dishes at a time, especially if they are 
favorite dishes. It requires very little forethought to 
select menus that will give them what they like, yet at 
the same time what they require. It is a mistake to 
suppose that children desire daring their earliest years
-P-A-G-E-148
128 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
a great variety of food at every meal ; nor do they need 
it. A little observation of their manner of receiving 
the announcement of a new dish, as compared with the 
shout of delight upon the appearance of an old favorite 
that has probably not been seen for several days, will 
demonstrate to any mother the truth of this assertion. 
During hot weather it is well to remember, for many 
and obvious reasons, to give less variety at a time, and 
to have the articles well prepared and well combined, 
not in the least neglecting the use of foods containing 
salts (fruit and fresh vegetables). ‘Jor dinner menus 
in summer, use meat, fish, and eggs alternately, never 
together; with them use one starchy. food, as baked 
potato, rice, spaghetti, etc., and one food supplying salts, 
either fruit or vegetables, sometimes giving the latter 
class of food as directed above, in the form of a fruit 
sauce or vegetable purée over rice, etc. When con- 
structing summer menus select broths instead of meats 
for use with macaroni or spaghetti, which are part 
proteids, but in menus calling for starchy foods like 
Tice and potatoes, select meats and fish (proteids) alter- 
nately, and complete both menus with some salt-giving 
food (fresh vegetables or fruit). A vegetable purée is an 
especially desirable summer food (page 88). Blanc- 
mange may be made from farina, from wheat (cooked 
very soft and pressed through a purée sieve), from rice, 
tapioca, or gluten. When served with fruit juice or 
sauce, it makes a pleasant change, and one that is usually enjoyed by the little ones. 
Avoid at all times, but especially in summer, the_.. 
use of sweets that are ctoying; over- or under-ripe 
fruit, stale vegetables, and too much meat. Carbo-
-P-A-G-E-149
SUMMER DIET. 129 
hydrates (sugars and starches) should be given in the 
proportion of four to one of proteids (meat, eggs, etc.). 
When corn is young and tender, a corn omelet, with 
bread and butter and a glass of milk, makes.a satisfac- 
tory dinner for a hot day. Score the grains of corn 
through the middle, and press out enough pulp to flavor 
an omelet. Use the recipe given elsewhere for a tender 
omelet (page 172), putting in the vegetable pulp just 
before folding, as it requires but a few minutes for cook- 
ing. Do not allow the omelet to get dry. It should be 
moist and soft when served. This is delicious when 
properly cooked and well seasoned. Purée of stewed 
onions, or a teaspoonful of raw onion juice, or grated 
onion, or any other vegetable allowed in the nursery, 
may be used instead of the corn pulp for making these 
omelets. This plan of only one or two dishes for din- 
ner should not be followed continuously. It is sug- 
gested for the occasional relief of the busy mother who 
at this season of the year finds herself overtaxed, and 
she must receive her due share of consideration in all 
these matters, as a child’s well-being, not only physically 
but mentally, depends upon the mother’s condition. An 
occasional use of this plan prevents satiety also upon the 
part of the child. 
Macaroni or spaghetti, boiled tender first and then 
simmered in beef broth, cream, or milk, is a perfect 
one-course dinner for a child, and one that is usually 
appreciated, A glass of milk and bread and butter 
should be given with it. 
Desserts in summer may frequently be supplementary 
foods. By this I mean that eggs, rice, tapioca, milk, 
ete,, may be freely used in desserts, and this portion of 
9 I
-P-A-G-E-150
130 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
the meal may contain a large share of the nourishment 
required for the entire meal. In this form these ingre- 
dients are easily digested, and the other part of a menu 
containing one of these desserts need not be so heavy 
as in cold weather, thus somewhat relieving digestion 
at a time when relief is required. 
‘What to give to the children for supper, especially in 
summer, may seem a trifling matter, yet it is really of 
the utmost importance. A child’s rest at night depends 
very largely upon what it has had to eat at this meal. 
Two safe rules to follow are, never to give a heavy sup- 
per, and never, if possible, to give it later than five or 
half-past five o’clock, until a child is six years old, thus 
leaving an hour and a half to intervene before it is time 
for the nightly sponge, which is so refreshing before 
bedtime in hot weather, and which, with a well-selected 
supper, induces sleep in defiance of the heat, however 
oppressive. I find it is not unusual for mothers to give 
the evening meal to their little ones as late as half-past 
six or seven o’clock, in some instances as late as half- 
past seven, for their own convenience, and yet they will 
visit physicians regularly and ask advice as to what 
should be done to make their children sleep soundly, 
complaining that they are restless, wakeful, easily dis- 
turbed, ete. A child who has had a simple and early 
supper will be found, if well, to protest against being 
disturbed, and will want to sleep: It is possible and very desirable to. give even a baby its ten or eleven 
o’elock bottle, which should be its last feeding for the 
night, without thoroughly awaking it (page 163), thus encouraging the habit.of continuous sleep from seven to 
seven, which once established is the greatest boon that
-P-A-G-E-151
SUMMER DIET. 131 
a tired mother can ask, and is of equal benefit to the 
child. 
Sleeplessness or disturbed sleep in a child points 
either to a faulty regimen or is the forerunner of dis- 
ease, and it invariably needs attention and correction. 
Ti is one of the safest indications for the mother who 
watches closely the condition of her child. 
The old-fashioned bowl of bread and milk cannot 
be improved upon for a child’s supper, if the milk be 
“sweet and the bread well baked and made of good 
flour. A half-dozen prunes added, stewed or fresh- 
ened as directed on page 175, will make as satisfactory 
a supper as it is possible to find for a child over two and: 
a half years of age. Graham biscuit in place of the 
bread, with clarified apples made according to the recipe 
given, is another simple yet desirable summer menu. 
An occasional dish of rice and milk or a baked potato 
is frequently suggested, and may be admissible, but it 
is much wiser in hot weather to reserve rice for break- 
fast—to be used instead of the more’ heating cereals—- 
and baked potatoes for dinner. With well-cooked rice 
or wheat for breakfast, potato, macaroni, or spaghetti 
for dinner, and the occasional use of farina or tapioca, 
the matter of starchy foods in summer should be pretty 
well covered, leaving supper menus to be supplied with 
dishes that are more simple and more certain of not 
disturbing a night’s rest. 
The use of stewed fruit is to be advocated for_all 
times and all seasons of the year, after two “and one- 
half’ years, and if fruit at all be given at the evening 
meal, it should be cooked. Fresh fruit should never 
be given to children after dinner. I have frequently
-P-A-G-E-152
132 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
heard this question discussed, and many mothers are in 
favor of giving it later in the day, but I cannot alter my 
opinion that fresh fruit should not be given to young 
children later than at the one o’clock dinner. There 
is no necessity, at any rate, for doing so, as any child, 
if treated wisely, will care far more for his bread and 
milk or Graham biscuit and milk than for all the fruit 
you may offer him. I frequently find that even the 
dish of stewed fruit is not appreciated so much at 
supper-time as at breakfast, at which time it is often 
eaten with great relish and is usually the first dish to 
be called for. After discovery of this fact, I fre- 
quently changed my nursery menus in this direction, 
omitting the use of any kind of fruit at supper-time 
unless it was asked for, giving stewed fruit for break- 
fast, and reserving fresh fruit for dinner menus in 
summer, when little meat or fat is used. In this way 
I found it easier to adapt the use of fruit in some 
form to nursery menus containing milk dishes, which 
sometimes cause trouble when fresh fruit is used in 
the same menu. At the risk of being tedious it seems 
advisable to lay stress upon points like these, even 
if they do appear to be self-evident. Milk should, for 
instance, form a large portion of the breakfast menu, 
and with such use of milk it is usually very much better 
for children under five to have stewed fruit instead of 
the average so-called ripe fruit that is sold so often in 
our markets. For this reason chiefly I prefer using at 
breakfast-time fruits that have been stewed, as less 
likely to. cause trouble, and fresh fruit that is really 
Tipe for dinner, when milk is usually omitted from the menu, This rule is not an inflexible one, however,
-P-A-G-E-153
SUMMER DIET. - 133 
and any mother who is sure of the condition of the 
fruit she buys—that it is perfectly fresh, sound, and 
ripe, not over- or under-ripe—may follow the usually 
suggested plan of fresh fruits for breakfast and stewed 
fruits for supper, with puddings, etc., for desserts for 
dinner. I have, however, found the other plan per- 
fectly practicable, and a great relief in hot weather. 
A pleasant addition in summer to a supper of bread 
and milk, or to a glass of milk, for a child over a year 
old, is a tablespoonful of Mellin’s Food, stirred into 
the cool milk, where it will not dissolve, and will 
please the palate, inasmuch as it tastes like molasses 
candy. Itis a valuable but somewhat expensive sup- 
plementary food for growing children. I have fre- 
quently seen two children of five eating it dry with as 
much enjoyment as I have seen others show when eat- 
ing candy, and certainly it was with less detriment to 
themselves than if they had been indulging in the use 
of what should have small place in nursery dietaries, 
—ie., candy. An ideally trained..child.of-three-or 
four should know nothing of the existence of candy.as 
candy, but in these days of careless nursery-maids and 
equally careless friends and relatives it is difficult for 
the most careful mother to protect her little ones, and 
it is not unusual to see even a two-year-old child with 
sticky face and fingers and the inevitable stick of 
candy, the panacea for all ills, When the abuse of 
candy as a bribe in training children is fuily compre- 
hended by our nursery and educational reformers, they 
will be sure of one of the causes of -certain results 
deplored, and know at least one way in which to direct 
reform.

and it should never be neglected, especially in summer. 
A child four or five years old should drink at least 
half a pint of water between five o’clock supper and 
seven o’clock bedtime. The habit of drinking water 
both morning and evening can be cultivated with a 
little care, and it is a habit of great importance through- 
out life in its result upon sluggish conditions. That 
this fact is not fully appreciated is evidenced by the 
constant cry in the nursery for laxative medicines, 
which are used and advised far too frequently.

CHAPTER X. 
Travelling Outfits and Precautions. 
How to keep children strong and well under con- 
flicting circumstances is one of the questions constantly 
met with, thought about, and talked over by interested 
mothers. It is comparatively easy to find out just what 
is the right thing to do, but very frequently it is ex- 
tremely difficult to do it. One mother without a ser- 
vant, for instance, might like to sponge her child of 
three before putting it to bed at seven, but this hap- 
pens to be the time she is obliged to devote to the prepa- 
‘ration of her husband’s dinner. What is she to do? 
Another mother knows her child would be the better 
for a morning sponge before breakfast, but it is im- 
possible to give it to him, as she must prepare this meal 
for the remaining members of her family ; and so on 
ad infinitum. 
These are but common illustrations of what is met 
with every day, in every direction, and in these days 
of children’s rights there is much to be said upon the 
mother’s side. She owes it to her children as well as 
to herself to keep perfectly well. They will need her 
influence more and more the older they grow; there- 
fore, if circumstances prove too strong at times to 
allow for the ideal care of children without the sacri- 
fice of the mother’s health and well-being (mental wear 
and tear being considered as well as physical), by all 
185
-P-A-G-E-156
136 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
means let the children when in average health take their share in the sacrifices that must be made. Deli- 
cate children, and those who are ill, it is obvious, can- 
not be considered in this connection, as everything must be made subservient to their needs for the time, but when children are well, let them help make the burden 
lighter ; for burden it undoubtedly is for many mothers who are physically weak, and who may have no relief 
from one year’s end to the other, or have spasmodic 
help at best. A little wholesome neglect as to a child’s 
dress and as strict adherence as is possible to method in 
sleeping and feeding will help to ease the mother’s way, 
and will prove wonderfully important factors in making 
the work less laborious when several children are to be 
cared for by one pair of hands. 
At no time does there seem to be so much difficulty 
in adjusting circumstances as when travelling, and as under the best regulations in the nursery it is some- 
times necessary to travel with very young children, it 
may be of interést to consider the comfort of what 
might be called an emergency travelling-bag, so de- 
signed, with the contents well considered as to possible 
needs, that it takes up very little room, is not too heavy 
to handle constantly, and, above all, is the greatest pos- 
sible convenience a mother can have under trying-cir- 
cumstances. Tn this bag it is advisable to carry a few 
simple home remedies, such as a small box of mus- tard, a box of mustard leaves, soda mint tablets, a bottle of white vaseline for chafing, etc.; lanolin for head and chest colds; gluten suppositories or-a_boitle of fluid magnesia (to be used only when absolutely 
necessary, actording to the age of the child, a tea-
-P-A-G-E-157
TRAVELLING OUTFITS AND PRECAUTIONS. 137 
spoonful of magnesia for“an infant, or a suppository 
for a child of older years); chalk mixture for diar- 
rhoea ; a vaporizer and benzoinol for catarrhal colds, a 
hot-water bottle, and, above all, a fever mixture that 
has been prescribed by a physician as suited to the age 
of the child. Although these articles are easily procured 
at almost any place, it is better to carry them along, 
as they take up little room, and when needed they are 
wanted instantly. Sudden indispositions and the first 
symptoms of illness are what a mother must prepare 
for at all times, whether at home or travelling, that she 
may be able to act promptly whilst waiting for the 
arrival of the physician, who may be beyond imme- 
diate reach. For this reason it is well to pay special 
attention, for a long journey, to supplementary foods, 
to be taken, with a sufficient supply of prepared milk, 
in this bag of comfort. 
The independence given by a small alcohol lamp 
and a pint aluminum cup for heating milk or-water will 
never again be underestimated by any mother who has 
tried carrying these things with her when travelling 
for any distance, or when away from home for even a 
day or two, For a day’s journey with, or a day’s ab- 
sence from, a bottle-fed baby, milk that has been pre- 
pared for the purpose at a milk laboratory, such as may 
be found in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, etc., 
should be provided if possible ; but, if not attainable, it is 
practicable and convenient to prepare in the morning 
enough feedings of milk, using peptogenic milk powder, 
to carry the child safely through the entire day. For 
a longer journey, when fresh milk can be procured 
every morning or at short intervals, this process of pre 
12*
-P-A-G-E-158
138 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
paring milk may be followed whenever necessary or 
convenient if the milk powder and lamp be carried 
along. This powder is useful also in cases of sudden 
attacks of indigestion or bowel complaint, when pep- 
tonized or partially peptonized milk should be the only 
food. until a physician is available. It is also a safe 
and satisfying food tor travelling convalescents or deli- 
cate children. When it is impossible to get fresh milk 
to use with the powder or to get the laboratory milk, 
take a sufficient number of bottles of prepared top 
milk,—done by the higher temperature of 190° to 212° 
F,., that it may remain sweet for the time required,— 
allowing room in each bottle for the addition of the 
hot water needed, which will warm it sufficiently for 
use. A physician should direct as to quantity for dilu- 
tion. The water should be heated over the alcohol 
lamp (boiling it to be sure it is pure), and be added 
with whatever is especially required at the time of 
feeding. The use of top milk supplies the neces- 
sary cream, which is difficult to get when travel- 
ling. When undiluted milk is to be given to older 
children, it is only necessary to place the bottle very 
carefully in the cup of heated water until the lower 
portion is quite hot; then, on shaking the bottle, the 
milk will be found to be of the required temperature. 
Another source of difficulty in travelling is to keep 
the nipples sweet. The seamless nipples alluded to 
elsewhere will remain sweet under all ordinary cir- 
cumstances. “They can be washed as clean as a glass or 
a cup, for the surface is very smooth. 
In this manner, with very little trouble, a mother may travel quite comfortably with a young baby. By

having and using her own appliances she is indepen- 
dent of indifferent hotel accommodations in the way 
of food, and, above all, she is freed from the use of 
“refrigerator” milk. By this I mean milk that has 
been standing all day, possibly uncovered, in a re- 
frigerator that is generally lacking in point of clean- 
liness, and which contains a variety of foods, each 
contending with the other for prominence in the flavor 
that is being given to the milk, At one time, in the 
dining-room of a very well known New York hotel, I 
ordered some milk toast for my boy’s supper. When 
it came it gave evidence of milk having been used that 
was on the point of what is usually termed souring, 
the curd having separated during heating. The milk 
had, of course, reached a condition that was unsafe for 
a child’s food long before it was used for the purpose I 
called for, yet I had taken the precaution to interest 
the waiter sufficiently to see to it personally that sweet 
milk should be used. I then ordered a glass of milk 
to be served scalding hot. This time the milk was 
sweet; yet I was assured that it was taken from the 
same supply for both purposes, which was manifestly 
untrue. 
When children are old enough to go to hotel or res- 
taurant tables, it is advisable to have all milk that bis 
served to them brought upon the table steaming hot. 
Let the little ones wait, even if hungry, until it has 
cooled sufficiently for drinking, and you will have 
the satisfaction of knowing that it is at least a com- 
paratively safe food. Early in the day it is reasonably 
safe to depend upon the usual supply, if care is taken 
to have the milk served hot, but later the danger of
-P-A-G-E-160
140 HOW T0 FEED CHILDREN. 
contamination is always present ; hence for travelling 
children, who should always be carefully fed, it is ad- 
visable to be prepared for emergencies by carrying a 
sufficient quantity of prepared milk. Some years ago, 
when going to a hotel in a vicinity where I was uncer- 
tain of the milk-supply, I took with me twenty-seven 
bottles of prepared milk perfectly fresh when heated. 
These bottles were packed in a tin bath-tub and carried 
safely. I was thus able to take time to find sweet milk 
for our daily supply, and also incidentally to feed a few 
hungry babies who would otherwise have gone supper- 
less to bed, owing to the souring of the hotel supply 
upon which the mothers of these babies had depended. 
Precautions like the above give very little trouble, and 
the comfort they bring in their train is ample compen- 
sation for the small amount of labor involved. 
When travelling, avoid the free use of fresh fruits 
and vegetables. for. children who have reached the age 
to take them when at home. ‘The safest menus, and 
those least likely to cause trouble, may be selected from 
foods like bread and milk, eggs, cereals, stewed fruit, 
and broiled chops or steak for breakfast,—biscuit or 
bread broken into hot milk for supper, allowing stewed 
fruit or bread, butter, and syrup, with milk to drink, 
for older children, and for dinner a chop or bit of roast 
beef, a baked potato, if mealy, and well-boiled rice or 
macaroni, with a perfectly ripe peach, apple, or some 
other wholesome fruit for dessert. These are usually 
safe foods, and are easily procured, as a rule; but if by chance you cannot get them, fall back on your emer- 
gency bag, which should contain Graham or educator 
biscuits and prepared milk, which will make an all-
-P-A-G-E-161
TRAVELLING OUTFITS AND PRECAUTIONS. 141 
sufficient breakfast or supper, and a bottle of some good 
beef-juice preparation and a small bottle of Zinfandel 
or Muscatel grape juice, with good bread and butter, 
will help the little ones along very satisfactorily for 
dinner until it is time for another trial of the fare 
offered as good by some affable landlord. Whilst not 
being a full menu, it is at any rate infinitely preferable 
to giving the child just what happens to be procurable, 
whether it be baked ham or fried egg-plant. Incredible 
as it may seem, I have heard of children of three eat- 
ing these things. I have also seen them drink beer, 
and have been looked upon in the light of a faddist 
for protesting where I was not properly introduced. 
Adults may, and will, take dietetic risks, but itis hardly 
safe to allow the little ones this liberty. The chances 
are that bitter regret will follow such indulgence. 
The use of ice water, and the eating of candy and 
cake between meals, are sources at all times of much 
mischief, but especially when travelling. Why the 
ordinary traveller rushes immediately for the water 
cooler, as I have seen him do scores of times, is beyond 
my ken. The ice-water.habitis.one_of our-greatest 
evils in a dietetic way, and with so glaring an example 
on the part of adults, why should we wonder that the 
children want to do likewise? They must be taught 
to abstain. Boiled water cooled on the ice and left 
covered in a convenient place within reach of the little 
ones will soon be taken in preference, at home, with but 
little care upon the part of the mother to establish this 
habit. For use on thetrain, a bottle of properly diluted 
grape juice will be very refreshing, and it will occa- 
sionally prove a valuable supplementary food to a
-P-A-G-E-162
142 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
restricted dinner menu, supplying the necessary salts so frequently omitted from the ordinary bill of fare. 
A word of caution about the use of drinking glasses 
provided on trains, etc., should be heeded. They 
should never be used, as too many evils follow. A 
small graduated glass should be taken along, as it occu- 
pies little room, and is useful in many ways. 
The above suggestions embody but a few of the many 
ways in which a mother may anticipate her needs when 
she expects to be beyond immediate reach of the various 
comforts and necessities that serve to make a complete 
nursery. Every case needs individualization, but let it 
be remembered chiefly, when travelling, that possible 
contingencies requiring immediate action are the things 
to be provided for, according to the conditions existing 
for the child or children under consideration.
-P-A-G-E-163
CHAPTER XI 
Fat in Food. 
Dr. Jacozt very wisely remarks that to understand 
only a small part of what is known on the vast topic 
of the development of infant life the mother must 
consult not one little volume, but many big books. If 
parents desire normal development,—i.e., sound teeth, 
strong bones, good digestion, firm flesh, and ruddy 
color,—let them not neglect the use of the proper con- 
stituents of food during the least resistant period of a 
child’s life, when many “ so-called” children’s ailments 
develop. 
One phase of this subject that should be more fre- 
quently considered than is usual is in regard to the 
use of fats in food for infants and growing children. 
According to all leading dietists, fat plays a most im~ 
portant partin nutrition. A pound of fat-givestrenrly

when fat is mixed with proteids in the stomach, as in 
the form of cream with the caseine of milk, digestion 
is made easier. 
As a result of experiments made in regard to the 
addition of fats to dietaries, tissue-waste is shown to 
be lessened, and. fat may therefore be regarded (ss an

“albumen-sparing” food. Bauer says, “If flesh alone 
be given, large quantities are required in order that 
nutrition and waste may balance one another, but if 
fat be added, the demand for flesh is less.” These 
statements will suggest to the mother the importance 
of its use for young children, to whom little meat is 
given, and who need much heat-giving food to main- 
tain body temperature and provide a reserve of force- 
producing material to meet the demands made by their 
constant activity and rapid growth. 
If either the various formule given by physicians 
for the modification of milk for infants, or the constit- 
uents of many proprictary infant foods, are studied, 
they will be found to indicate almost invariably the 
use of fat in the form of cream. This is usually in- 
sisted upon as an absolutely necessary ingredient,and 
it is done because analyses have shown that mother’s 
milk contains fat in a certain proportion to other in- 
gredients, which is one reason for the modification of 
milk; hence it will readily be seen why infant foods 
call for fat. Unfortunately, the majority of proprie- 
tary infant foods endeavor to reach a resemblance to 
mother’s milk in this particular only, of which more 
is said in another connection. Burnet speaks of the 
fatty constituents of food as being wanted in one type 
of children,—the slim and thin, with a strong dash of 
the nervous in their composition, In these cases there 
can be no doubt of the value of the use of an easily 
digested fat.

ceptable to the palate, and it is not often that children 
will refuse it. Many instances might be given showing 
how they have learned to like it sufficiently to relish it. 
In one instance brought to my notice, a boy of four, 
when suffering from a head cold, would frequently sit 
up in bed during the night and call, “My nose is 
tight; I want my coddy,” so great was his reliance 
upon this simple medicine. When in the form of an 
emulsion, it may be more pleasant to take. Inasmuch 
as a medicine, however simple, is useful only when 
properly used, it is necessary to know under what cir- 
cumstances to give it: hence in this connection, as in 
nearly all other particulars concerning the health of 
children, a physician’s advice is necessary. Professor 
Fonssagrives indicates its use during the most active 
periods of growth in children, when care and pre- 
cautionary measures must be redoubled. He says that 
mothers should feel anxious over impetuous develop- 
ment, which is never devoid of danger ; that the man- 
ner in which a child’s growth progresses is an excellent 
measure of the strength of his constitution and of the 
wisdom of the hygiene to which he is subjected ; that 
perfect harmony should be maintained between the 
various organs if possible, and even if difficult to ac- 
complish the effort should be made. He says expen- 
diture of force should be moderated and resources 
increased when rapid growth is noticeable, muscular 
activity be restrained, and very active kinds of exercise 
be replaced by those more passive ; that more than the 
usual amount of sleep should be taken ; that good and 
substantial food should be provided, aiming at nutrition 
and assimilation by giving plenty of air and sunshine;

and that a sojourn in the country and cod-liver oil 
are precious resources at such a time, if possible to 
be had. The use of the oil does not usually interfere 
with a plentiful supply of milk. It is always well to 
allow short intervals in its administration, and it is 
advisable to give small doses at first, as one spoonful 
well digested is better than four spoonfuls not digested. 
It should be given either with or about an hour after 
meals. The latter is the best time theoretically, as 
digestion has then so far advanced that the oil will not 
be retained in the stomach, but will be passed on to be 
digested with other fatty constituents of food. When 
taking it, a child should exercise and be in the open 
if possible. 
The use of fat, in the form of good cold butter, 
sweet: cream, or good olive or cod-liver oil, is indicated 
in catarrhal conditions. An easily digested fat moder- 
atély used during all seasons of the year except sum- 
mer and the warm days of spring and fall produces a 
resistance to colds in our ever-varying climate, and 
occasions no disturbance if given with care. Olive 
oil may be supplied very pleasantly with salads, but it 
should not be used in this combination before the school 
period of life,—ie., from eight years to adolescence. 
Fat in the form of cream in food for infants is so gen- 
erally advised that it need not be considered” in’ this 
“connection. Dr. Rotch has suggested cream as a de- 
sirable fat for children of all ages, and under certain 
conditions as preferable to any other fat. Itis certainly 
the most agreeable form in which fat may be prescribed 
for children, as is shown by the readiness with which 
it is usually taken. Care must be had, however, to give
-P-A-G-E-167

that which is perfectly sweet. Centrifugal cream that 
has been separated from the milk within a few hours of 
milking seems to be the most desirable, and it may be 
had at the Walker-Gordon laboratories in Boston, New 
York, Philadelphia, Chicago, etc. When this is not 
attainable, fresh milk should be rapidly cooled in ice, or 
spring, water, then immersed in cold water for several 
hours in covered vessels or wide-mouthed covered glass 
jars, from which the cream may be dipped or siphoned. 
The centrifugal cream has the advantage, however, of 
being freed by the process from much dirt and other 
matter that is foreign and also dangerous to milk. 
Many mothers still cling to the old-time notion of 
cream being too rich a food for children, and of milk 
being more easily digested than cream, and it is sur- 
prising to see how slowly they realize the necessity for 
supplying this form of fat in the food of an infant or 
a growing child. A half-cup of sweet-cream with the 
cereal to be used every morning in nursery feeding 
will go far towards meeting the requirements of-condi- 
tions calling for the use of fat in food, and it is a mat-— 
tef that should always be kept in mind by both physi- 
cian and mother in regulating dietaries for rapidly 
growing children,

CHAPTER XIL 
Diet for the Approach of Cool Weather. 
THE approach of cooler weather is the herald for 
the modifications in diet that are necessary for keeping 
a child resistant to sudden variations of temperature, 
for supplying sufficient warmth, and for providing 
energy to meet the activity induced by the pleasant 
change from the enervating months of summer. Any 
observant mother will see at once how quickly her 
children have been influenced by this change, how 
much more active they have become, and how appetite 
has improved; hence the necessity for a fuller diet. 
_ Oatmeal may now be used for breakfast, served with 
“cream; this combination, containing fat and starch, 
“supplies heat. A moderate amount of sugar is per- 
‘ missible, and some physicians say advisable, in cool 
weather if digestion is good, but it must not be given 
to children who are in the habit of eating quantities of 
candy between meals, as in all probability they receive 
far more sugar than they can digest, and it would be 
Tuinons to give them more. Dr. Rotch says, “The 
infant should never be given cake or candy, even to 
taste: I think that it is necessary to state this very 
decidedly, because it is an erroneous view which is held 
by most mothers that it can do no harm to give occa- sionally to an infant in its second year of life, or toa 
young child, a little candy or a little cake. This may

be true so far as the immediate effect these articles may 
have on the digestion is concerned, but it is of far more 
importance that the infant should not have its taste 
perverted from those articles of diet which are best for 
its nutrition. These new articles appeal more strongly 
to its sense of taste, and allow it to know that there is 
something which tastes more agreeable than the food 
which it is accustomed to have. When an infant has 
acquired a taste for cake or candy, it will cease to 
enjoy the food by which its development will be best 
perfected. It is, in fact, kinder to the infant never to 
allow it to taste cake or candy. When these articles 
are withheld, it will continue to have a healthy appe- 
tite and taste for necessary and proper articles of 
food.” A. very satisfactory way of giving sugar on 
oatmeal to a child who has already acquired the habit 
is to sprinkle it lightly over each spoonful, using a 
large salt-shaker. A trial will show that less than a 
teaspoonful will be required for an entire saucer of 
porridge, if care is given to the shaking. The least 
possible shake will usually suffice. This suggestion is 
intended to help those mothers who perhaps may have 
unwisely allowed their little ones to eat cereals bounti- 
fully sprinkled with sugar. So far as possible, it is 
safer to keep a child from knowing anything about 
eating it with food of any kind, but if the habit has 
once been formed, try regulating it in this way, and 
see if the child will not infinitely prefer the sweet gritty 
taste of the few granules he gets by sprinkling each 
spoonful immediately before he eats it to eating a 
syrupy concoction of porridge, milk, and a larger 
quantity that has dissolved. I have seen a child of

seven call for lump.after lump of sugar fora small cup 
of cocoa simply because each lump dissolved. before she 
could taste it, and she had no idea whatever of what 
sweet really meant. I have frequently seen this fact 
clearly demonstrated. I have also seen a child eat 
very contentedly a whole dish of oatmeal and cream 
minus salt or sugar, never missing the sugar, although 
accustomed to a little, because he was too intent upon 
something else to think of the action required to shake 
it over each teaspoonful of porridge. By simply watch- 
ing children as they eat, I have come to the conclusion 
that it is not necessary to sweeten foods to any great 
extent to gratify their palates, even if they have ac- 
quired the taste. If they must have sugar, let them 
have it just as it comes from the grocer,—a Jump after 
dinner for dessert, or on special occasions, as a supple- 
ment to an unsatisfactory meal, it may be sprinkled 
very lightly upon a piece of bread and butter. When 
sugar is handled carefully, it may be made a very im- 
portant article of food, as with good digestion it gives 
heat and energy and is easily assimilated. Efforts 
should always be made to supply it largely in its natural 
state, as in fruits, etc. 
C¥or chilly days cornmeal mush may also be used for 
breakfast.) The use of wheat and hominy need not be 
abandoned, but Gatmeal and cornmeal may now be 
used for the variations needed in the more liberal and 
heat-giving dietary required for cooler weather) An 
occasional baked potato is a pleasant addition to the 
fast menu (supplying starch and salts), or a baked 
pple served with top milk or pure sweet cream if able, leaving this menu to be very simply com-

pleted with bread and butter and a dish of rice or 
hominy, the starch element (carbohydrates) necessary 
to make a perfect combination, The apple is to be 
peeled before baking (page 115). Graham or corn- 
meal muffins, if thoroughly baked and made thin 30 
that they are nearly all crust, will be enjoyed ir @ol 
mornings, and if made in this way they will be far 
~~yiore wholesome than stale bread that has been poorly 
baked. ‘Too frequently the only virtue, so called, of 
one-day-old bread is the fact that it is stale. When 
muffins are crisp and dry throughout, they are appe- 
tizing and wholesome. They should not be given toa 
child when hot enough to melt the butter used, but 
when they are cool enough to put butter on in small 
pieces they will answer every purpose of good bread, 
and prove a pleasant variation. It must not be over- 
looked that muffins of whole or Graham meal would 
supply a fair proportion of the necessary constituents 
of a well-ordered menu, containing starch and pro- 
teids, also fat in the butter used. Hence a very com- 
plete little breakfast may be made of whole-meal bread 
and butter or whole-meal muffins and butter, supple- 
mented with a glass of milk and something supplying 
sugar and salts, as stewed fruit, for instance. Anyone 
who is familiar with the action of intense dry heat 
upon starch will readily understand why the above is 
practicable for the nursery. As muffins are ordinarily 
prepared, they are not allowable for children’s diet. 
Not enough attention is given to making meals ap- 
petizing for children who have reached an age that, 
to say the least, is somewhat discriminating. A child 
of five is fully able to enjoy excellent cooking. By
-P-A-G-E-172
152 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
this I mean simple articles well prepared. I have 
known one child who was taught to eat very simple 
food which was always prepared with great care. He 
invariably showed lack of appetite and little enjoyment 
of meals when away from home unless his mother 
directed the preparation of his food, and his frequent 
remark was, “Mamma, I like your cooking best.” Yet 
nothing was ever said in his presence to give rise to 
comparisons. This child was not yet five years old. 
For dinner menus in cooler weather a more_liberal 
allowaticé 6f starchy foods may be used, such as pota- 
toes, rice, purées of peas and beans, with tapioca and 
corn starch for desserts; instead of the broths, meats 
may be used every day, and fish occasionally in summer ; 
puddings may now appear for desserts alternately with 
fruits, not forgetting that salts must be supplied in these 
menus by giving a green vegetable in connection ; as, 
for instance, rare roast beef (proteid), baked potato 
{starch and salts—carbohydrate), dish gravy, purée of 
spinach (salts), with wine jelly for dessert; or, as a con- 
trasting menu, roast lamb (proteid), rice (starch —served 
with salt and cream to supply fat lacking in rice), dish 
gravy, with some wholesome fruit, fresh or stewed, for 
dessert, thus supplying the necessary salts. Supper 
menus should continue the same as those indicated for 
summer use, allowing the child to satisfy his appetite by 
takiig’asinuch bread and milk as he desires, or what- 
ever else is given in its place. It can never be insisted 
upon too much that children should have light suppers, 
and that digestion should have its hardest work to do 
during the day, before evening comes. If care is taken 
in this direction, sleep will be sound and rest will be

refreshing, There is no more perfect food combination 
for a child’s supper than a bowl of bread and milk ; 
in many nurseries this fact seems to be entirely over- 
looked. It is easily prepared, contains all the ele- 
ments necessary for a perfect food, and deserves a prom- 
inent place in a child’s dietary, provided the milk 
be pure and the bread wholesome. Jf by any un- 
avoidable circumstance a child has been deprived of a 
sufficient amoufit of nourishment during the day, as 
sometimes happens when travelling, and a capricious 
appetite interferes with the enjoyment of the bowl of 
bread and milk for supper, try a raw egg beaten up very 
light, with a breakfast-cupful of milk, a littlesugar, and 
a pinch of cinnamon added. This, with a piece of bread 
and butter, will make a full and easily digested meal, 
and is allowable for the evening meal under special 
circumstances. 
This is a fact to remember when one is away from 
home with children, and is, through disinclination to 
give trouble, subject to dietetic difficulties that fre- 
quently seem insurmountable.
-P-A-G-E-174
CHAPTER XIIlL 
Nursery Dietaries and Menus. 
Mixx, an infant’s first food, represents the four 
classes of foods,—proteids, carbohydrates, fats or hydro- 
carbons, and_inorganic foods, as salts and water, Inas- 
much as each meal given ¢6 a child after weaning must 
represent these different classes, it is evident that the 
simple principles underlying dietetics must be care- 
fully considered in the selection of menus. Simplicity 
must be the rule, one food of each class being usually 
sufficient to constitute a satisfactory meal. One of the 
greatest difficulties experienced is in the provision of 
sufficiently varied menus. This must be done that ap- 
petite may be stimulated to assist digestion. “Constant 
repetition of any food causes indifference,.nio matter 
how much it may have been enjoyed at first.) 
Taking it for granted, therefore, that those in charge 
of children understand thoroughly the principles of 
dietetics, there is still a great deal of study required for 
the selection of wholesome combinations. The follow- 
ing illustrative menus are intended to give assistance 
in this matter, either directly or by suggestion. They 
may be interchanged to suit the general house-supply, 
vegetables being used according to season, and care 
being taken to follow explanatory notes as to com- 
binations. But sufficient variety is given to obviate 
even this labor in constructing a varied dietary for a

child for each season. A little judgment and intelligent 
consideration can, however, carry still further the prin- 
ciples involved, if desired, by the study of the given 
proportions and combinations of the cereals, green and 
starchy vegetables, broths, meats, fats, and fruits, in 
their relation to the menus, and by the regulation of 
quantities according to the age and condition of the 
child. It will be noticed that quantities are men- 
tioned at times when certain foods are to be limited 
at each meal, leaving the others to be taken according 
to the appetite of each child. if a child is accustomed _ 
to regular, simple meals, its appetité may be trusted to _ 
regulate amounts: If, on the contrary, it has been fed 
“a little of evéFything,” and has been allowed to eat 
candy, efe., between meals, this point must be carefully 
considered, and an effort must be made to bring back 
the child to simple tastes and regular habits, by omit- 
ting the foods forbiddep for children and by giving no 
food between meals. (re amounts indicated should 
vary in accordance withthe age, weight, and condition 
of the child. It is evident that an active child needs 
more than one who is passive. Phe safest rule to fol; 
low.is to give, so far as possible,a-single-representa~ 
tive of each class of food at each meal }\to give little 
meat and sugar, and to complete the quantity required 
for each meal with broths, starchy vegetables, and either 
green vegetables or else fruits. When constructing a 
menu for a child, keep constantly in view the propor- 
tions required of the various classes of foods. 
All the dishes indicated in the following menus may 
be easily prepared by any one understanding the prin- 
ciples of cooking if care be given to the dainty prepa-

ration of the articles called for, and if scrupulous clean- 
liness (one of the most important factors in nursery 
cooking) be observed. Broths must be well skimmed 
after cooling. If made hurriedly, as may happen occa- 
sionally from necessity, and the broth is made from 
lean meat, it isa very simple matter to cool it suffi- 
ciently by placing it on ice or in cold running water, 
first skimming with a spoon, and then using a piece 
of clean blotting-paper or some large crumbs of bread; 
the latter will absorb the remaining beads of grease 
fairly well, and they do not leave an unpleasant taste, 
as the blotting-paper occasionally does. The use of fat — 
when in the form of cream or butter is advisable for a 
child, but itis decidedly not allowable when in the form 
of floating particles of grease upon the top of poorly 
made soup. 
Season carefully during the process of cooking. 
Things are tasteless and insipid if not seasoned at the 
proper time, and a child’s palate is as sensitive as that 
of the trained adult’s, even more so in some respects. 
It must be remembered that relish of food aids diges- 
tion. Children’s diet is usually too one-sided, contain- 
ing too much fat, starch, and sugar, and too little 
protein. Demme says that starchy food taken in too 
great quantity causes the white blood-corpuscles to pre- 
dominate over the red. This may serve to show to some 
mothers why their children are pale-faced and anemic.

should be more relied upon for variety than is usual. 
The error of using potatoes every day, instead of vary- 
ing with other starchy foods, is one of the most com- 
mon to be met with in the nursery. The starch of a 
properly cooked potato is easily digested, but too great 
reliance is usually placed upon its supplying a large 
share of the nutriment required in a well-balanced 
menu, whereas the fact of potatoes containing three 
parts of water to one part of starch shows the fallacy 
of this conclusion. They are useful for supplying salts 
in restricted dictaries: for instance, if vegetables or 
- fruits are not obtainable, they may be depended upon 
to supply some of the salts necessary for a well-bal- 
anced menu and at the same time provide starch and 
prevent concentration. The fact that the starch of 
potatoes is easily digested makes them a fit food for 
very young children ; therefore, if not abused,—that is, 
if not relied upon for every-day use to supply enough 
nourishment for a whole meal,—they are a valuable 
nursery food. It is often supposed that a baked potato 
makes a complete meal, when in’ reality it is a very 
meagre one unless supplemented by good whole-meal 
bread and butter and a glass of milk, or a chop if white 
bread is used instead of whole-meal bread. Macaroni 
owes much of its high nutritive quality to the gluten it 
contains, the presence of which, in addition to its other 
constituents, explains why it may be used as indicated 
elsewhere (page 127) for one-couzse menus, represent- 
ing as it does every class of food, being a little deficient 
only in fat as compared to wheat flour and oatmeal. 
This is corrected by the use of cream, or of butter and 
milk, in cooking (page 96). The usual custom is to

boil it in cold water, with the general result of # pasty, 
tasteless mass that certainly requires, to make it at all 
palatable, the addition of the cheese and tomato sauce 
so frequently used. If it is boiled tender in salted 
boiling water, dropping in a small piece at a time so 
that the water shall not cool, (page 96), this pastiness 
and tastelessness will be avoided, and the macaroni 
will have the rich, nutty flavor that gluten foods should 
always possess. 
There are numberless ways of varying nursery menus 
in a perfectly simple and wholesome manner, and there 
is no part of the study of domestic science that will more 
amply repay the thoughtful and painstaking mother 
than that relating to the pleasure, comfort, and well- 
being of her children. 
Dr, Thompson’s General-Rules for Feeding Young _ 
Children, given in “Practical Dietetics,’ are concise 
and comprehensive, as may be seen from the following : 
1. Allow time for meals, 
2. See that the food is thoroughly masticated. 
3. Do not allow nibbling between meals. 
4. Do not tempt the child with the sight of rich 
nd indigestible foods. 
5. Do not force the child to eat against its will, but 
xamine the mouth, which may be sore from erupting 
' eeth, and examine the food, which may not be properly 
: cooked or flavored. If good food is refused from 
peevishness merely, remove it, and do not offer it again 
before the next meal-time. 
6. In acute illness, reduce and dilute the food at once. 
7. In very hot weather give about one-fourth or 
e-third leas food, and offer more water.
-P-A-G-E-179
NURSERY DIETARIES AND MENUS. 159 
Dr. Rotch, of Boston, says the nutrition of young 
human beings may be divided into three distinct nu- 
tritive periods, corresponding to the stages of their de- 
velopment. The first period consists of the first tem 
or twelve months of life, during which time milk is 
the food considered. The second period comprises 
the second and third years, and the third period the 
remaining years of childhood, He says, ‘The science 
of feeding depends almost exclusively, in addition 
to the general principles of which I have already 
spoken,* on the knowledge of what elements of the 
food are required by the growing tissues in these nu- 
tritive periods, and also on the time when the various 
digestive functions are ready and able to dispose of 
them.” Dr, Rotch’s remarks concerning these periods 
are very readily understood, and they cover the ground 
in a concise, simple, and authoritative manner. The 
first period is spoken of in another connection (page 19). 
He says of the second period, from the twelfth month 
to the twenty-eighth or thirtieth month of life, that 
this is about the second half of the period which we 
are in the habit of calling infancy ; and it also includes 
the time when the last four teeth of the first set appear. 
He says further, “In this second nutritive period the 
element of variety in the food becomes important. Tt 
is undoubtedly izportant that the actual nutritive 
values of the food which it is best to give to infants 
in this period be considered, but it is much more im- 
portant that special attention be paid to its variety. 
Foods should be given which, while containing a fair 
eee

160 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
percentage of nutritive elements, yet differ in the com- 
bination of these elements to such a degree that they 
fulfil the requirements of this period of life. It is 
best to increase gradually the variety of articles of ' 
diet from the twelfth to the twentieth month, always 
adapting the food to the especial infant. Thus some 
infants may be able to digest and assimilate propor- 
tionately large quantities of starch; others may both 
need and digest larger proportions of the proteids or 
of sugar than the infants first spoken of. 
“Between the twelfth and thirteenth months I am 
in the habit of giving the infant five meals during the 
day. At this time it is well to accustom it to take its 
food from a spoon, and as soon as possible to omit 
feeding from the bottle. The five meals should be 
arranged in the following manner : 
“For breakfast, bread and cow’s milk, slightly 
warmed. 
“For lunch, equal parts of oat jelly and cow’s milk, 
warmed, with a little salt added according to the in- 
fant’s taste. 
“This meal of oat jelly should be repeated in the 
middle of the afternoon. 
“Tn the middle of the day, broth of some kind, 
either chicken or mutton, carefully prepared so as to be 
free from fat on its surface, can be given with some 
bread. 
“The fifth meal should be given in the latter part 
of the afternoon, and should consist of bread and 
milk. 
“Tn some cases it is impossible to make infants 
swallow bread for a long period after the usual time
-P-A-G-E-181
NURSERY DIETARIES AND MENUS. 161 
of twelve to thirteen months. At times it is not until 
they are two and one-half to three years old that they 
can be induced to take bread. In these cases we must 
feed them according to our judgment of the individual 
case, 
“When the infant is fourteen to fifteen months old, 
some thoroughly boiled rice can be added to the broth 
in the middle of the day, and if it digests this well it 
can also have bread given with this meal. 
“When the infant is sixteen months old, it can have 
a small amount of butter on its bread. When it is 
seventeen to eighteen months old, it can have a thor- 
oughly baked white potato, mixed with butter and 
salt, added to its mid-day meal of broth, When it is 
nineteen to twenty months old, eggs can become part 
of its diet. 
“There are not many fruits which should be given 
to the infant in its second year. A baked apple 
can be given at the evening meal when the infant is 
fourteen to fifteen months old; or, for variety, the 
apple can be made into a simple sauce, never, however, 
having the sauce made with much sugar. When 
peaches are in season, a ripe peach can often be given 
with benefit, especially if the infant is inclined to be 
constipated. Other fruits should be avoided, as they 
are not necessary for the infant’s nutrition, and at 
times produce serious trouble. 
“The third nutritive period I have arbitrarily made 
to begin at about the thirtieth month of life. 
“ At this time it will be well to begin to accustom 
the child’s digestive functions to a still greater variety 
of food. In summer, the more easily digestible vege-

tables, such as squash, young peas, and young beans, can 
be given. The variety of fruits can also be increased at 
this period, but they should be cooked. The principal 
change which is to be made in the diet to which the infant 
has been accustomed is a very decided increase in the 
proportion of the proteid element of its food. This is 
accomplished by means of giving the child meat. The 
quantity of meat which should be given towards the 
end of the third year should be small at first, and 
should be given at intervals of a day or two. Meat 
as a regular article of diet for each day is not, as a 
rule, required until the child is between three and four 
years old. The kinds of meat which should be given 
in this early period of childhood are chicken, mutton- 
chop, roast beef, and beefsteak. These meats should 
be cut into small pieces, and a little salt added accord- 
ing to the child’s taste. It is well, during the latter 
part of the third year and the first half of the fourth 
year, to give the child an egg on one day and meat on 
the next. 
“When the child has reached the age of five or six 
years, we should allow it to have a somewhat more 
varied diet, but during the whole period of childhood 
up to the age of puberty the closest attention should 
be given to the regulation of the kind and the amount 
of food to be given to the child, and any deviations 
from the rules which I have just laid down are to be 
deprecated.” 
It should be particularly noted that meat is not 
given until after the second period,—i.e., after thirty 
months,—and eggs are withheld until the child is nine- teen or twenty months old. ,

The following menus are constructed upon this base, 
suggested by Dr. Rotch, and explanatory notes are 
introduced where it seems advisable. The hours for 
the five meals from twelve months may be arranged, 
as most convenient for the average household, as 
follows : 
TWELVE TO THIRTEEN MONTHS. 
7am. Early breakfast—a breakfast-cupful or a 
six-ounce bottle of warm milk; a piece of bread or a 
biscuit. 
9.30 a.a. Breakfast proper—two tablespoonfuls of 
oat jelly with the same quantity of milk, seasoned with 
a little salt. 
12.30 p.m. Dinner—a cup of chicken broth with 
stale bread crumbs; one tablespoonful of gelatin, 
flavored with orange juice (page 216). 
3,30 p.m. Repeat meal given at 9.30. 
6.30 p.m. Supper—one-day-old bread broken in 
warm milk (six ounces). 
Supper at half-past six gives time for the child to 
have a few minutes’ rest before going to sleep at seven. 
The child should be dressed for the night before re- 
ceiving this meal, that unnecessary handling upon a 
full stomach may be avoided. Half-past six is the 
time frequently advised for the first meal in the morn- 
ing, but, by judicious training as to sleep, seven o’clock 
will be found early enough, and if the habit of sleep 
is once fixed a child will not wake before this time, 
thus giving many mothers without nurses the oppor- 
tunity for sparing their strength a little in the early 
morning. It is also of great assistance under some
-P-A-G-E-184
164 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
circumstances to give the first meal from the bottle 
for a longer period than twelve months, as at this 
early hour much carelessness may be expected from 
ordinary servants in the handling of baby’s food, and 
unless there is a reliable nurse the mother must usually 
rise very much earlier than is necessary for other de- 
mands. The plan of having a bottle ready for warm- 
ing at seven o’clock in the morning will obviate many 
sources of trouble that are frequently met with, and, 
while not the ideal plan, it is practically much better 
than to allow servants an opportunity for careless 
handling of baby’s first meal for the day, which may 
readily change the tenor of that entire day’s atmos- 
phere. Breakfast at 9.30 for baby gives the mother 
time to take her own comfortably, to bathe her child 
at nine, and feed it at half-past, after which it should 
sleep an hour or more, and then be taken out for a 
while before dinner at 12.30. It may be taken out 
for an hour again after dinner, from which time it will 
be likely to sleep until its next meal at half-past three. 
From this time it should be kept awake until it is 
ready to be put to sleep for the night at seven, after 
being undressed and fed at half-past six. Dr. Samuel 
‘Adams, of Washington, says, “A young infant has 
nothing to do but eat and sleep. As soon as he is fed 
he will take a nap, and will probably sleep for an hour 
and a half. After the first year the naps become 
shorter and less frequent. During the second year a 
nap in the morning after breakfast, and one in the after- 
noon about one or two o’clock for an hour or an hour 
and a half, are usually sufficient, and these naps should 
be insisted upon for the rest of his mind and body
-P-A-G-E-185
NURSERY DIETARIES AND MENUS. 165 
and to enhance his growth and health. As the child 
attains the third year he can usually drop the morning 
nap. The afternoon one should be insisted upon very 
soon after the child has his noonday meal, in winter as 
well as in summer.” Some physicians advise a night 
feeding at ten or eleven, to be given until eighteen 
months. If so, the food may be given from a bottle 
without disturbing the child’s sleep by keeping to the 
same hour exactly and gently touching the lips of the 
child with the tip, lifting the pillow carefully at the 
same time. A child who is well is usually so sleepy 
that it will take the milk very readily without opening 
its eyes. At this time any necessary changes for the 
night may also be made, to avoid further chance of 
disturbance. Regularity in this method is certain to 
bring eventual success. If, during this early period 
of feeding, great care is given to the little points that 
appear to many to be trifling at the time, a fixed habit 
of sound sleep from seven to seven may be formed, 
that will prove one of the greatest blessings conferred 
upon a child by a wise mother.

teaspoonfuls of orange juice may be given, and a little 
later the soft pulp of two or three stewed prunes, or a 
baked or stewed apple.” (Holt.) 
As Dr. Rotch says, this is a sufficient diet for this 
period, and it is worse than folly for mothers to attempt 
at this early age, as is frequently done, to accustom 
their children to the use of everything and anything 
from the general table. There are many persons, again, 
who will follow a cautious course in nursery feeding 
to a certain point, and then undo all by a fitful lapse 
into carelessness. The remarks made in this connec- 
tion should be emphasized if the infant’s digestion and 
general nutrition are to be considered, and the parents 
should insist that no other articles of food be employed 
except such as are similar to those spoken of,—namely, 
the cereals in a variety of forms, according to the taste, 
judgment, and knowledge of cooking which exists. in 
the special household.

SUGGESTIONS FOR BREAKFAST IN SUMMER FOR CHIL- 
DREN FROM THREE TO FIVE. 
One only of the following articles, with cream and 
salt: Cracked wheat, rice, tapioca, breakfast hominy, 
gluten (containing little or no fat). 
One only of the following articles: Eggs boiled 
(covered with boiling water as directed, page 81); 
poached in salted water that does not boil; scrambled 
(ightly); omelet (eggs not to be separated for beating). 
For omelet use one tablespoonful of hot water to one 
egg instead of milk, as customary, beat about a dozen 
times with a fork, and cook quickly: the result will 
be a deliciously tender omelet. Broiled fish. Broiled 
bacon. Asparagus tops may be given frequently with 
any of the above articles. 
One only of the following articles: Stewed rhubarb 
(laxative), orange or lemon jelly (made with gelatin), 
strawberries (carefully given, noting effect), baked 
apple, gelatin pudding or calf’s-foot jelly, etc. 
SUMMER DINNER MENUS FROM THREE TO FIVE 
YEARS, 
1. Beef broth. Broiled fish, Baked potato. Spin- ach purée. A ripe, sweet orange for dessert, Bread and butter. 
2. Vegetable omelet made with chopped asparagus

tips that have been previously boiled tender; or, if 
preferred, a plain omelet and the asparagus served 
alone, with or without cream sauce. A small cup of 
a good digestible cocoa with educator crackers for 
dessert. 
3. Chop (lamb) broiled. Boiled rice, served with 
cream and salt, Bread, butter, and honey. Glass of 
milk if desired. In place of honey, fruit juice may 
be used. 
4, Mutton broth with barley. Boiled egg. Aspara- 
gus tips with salt, or stewed onion with cream sauce. 
A cup of junket or a cup custard, Bread and 
butter. 
5. Broiled beef pulp. Spaghetti with cream sauce, 
the sauce to be made as directed in a former article, with 
good butter, cream or milk, and flour. Four or five 
large prunes, stewed or simply freshened by soaking 
overnight in cold water, after washing well, may be 
given for dessert. Children who will not eat stewed 
prunes, or who have grown tired of them, will wel- 
come the above change. 
6. Purée of onion with beef broth, served either 
together or alone. Farina, cooked with salt and 
served with cream. Strawberry gelatin for dessert, 
using the clear juice only for flavoring. Bread and 
butter. 
7. Poached egg served on well-made toast. Cauli- 
flower tops, if tender, or a dish of apple sauce. A 
saucer of rice pudding flavored with cinnamon. The 
use of cauliflower and onion should be deferred to the 
latter part of this period of feeding, and results should 
be watched very carefully.

a raw apple. 
4. Hominy; cream ; whole-meal muffins, made ac- 
cording to recipe for cream muffins (page 209); baked 
potato; broiled fat bacon; milk; stewed fruit or white 
or Tokay grapes (no seeds or skins). 
Dinner menus for this period should be supplied 
with the proteids of foods in proper proportions (meat, 
game, fish, oysters, eggs, milk foods, broths, etc.) and 
with salt-giving foods (fresh vegetables and fruits), 
and supper should always include whole-meal bread, 
stewed fruits, and an abundance of milk. 
The following will serve as a sample dinner menu 
for the second dentition period: a cup of beef broth 
thickened slightly with oatmeal, or mutton broth with 
barley ; broiled fish, or lamb-chops, with green peas; 
whole-meal bread well toasted and buttered when cool, 
so that the butter will not melt; orange tapioca for 
dessert. 
Notice that there are proteids, to form bone for the 
teeth, in nearly every food prescribed, and that never- 
theless the salts and the starches are not omitted. The 
oatmeal in the soup contains proteids and salts; the 
fish, phosphates; the whole-meal bread, proteids and 
carbohydrates; the butter, fat; the orange, salts; the 
tapioca, starch ; and the peas contain proteids and salts. 
It must not be forgotten that the condition of a 
child’s second set of teeth.depends very largely on the 
kind of food taken during the years immediately pre- 
ceding second dentition.

vention is always better than cure; and early 
with prompt recognition and treatment of symptoms, 
in conditions not normal, is far better than to allow 
the development of fevers, rickets, marasmus, and other 
innumerable ills to which children are constantly sub- * 
jected unnecessarily on account of ignorance and care- 
lessness upon the part of those who are responsible. 
The late Dr. John 8, Parry, of Philadelphia, stated that 
more than one-quarter of all the children between the 
ages of one month and five years who came under his 
observation in the Philadelphia Hospital during a 
period of three years were rachitic. Dr. Gee, of Lon- 
don, says that of the patients under the age of two years 
who have come under his observation in the London 
Hospital, one-third were rachitic. 
“The digestion of an infant should never b be forced ; 
the true index may be found ‘by studying the. actions 
of the bowels. No method of feeding should be 
tolerated until the passages show that the food is 
being digested and appropriated.” * Quotations are

182 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
greatest amount of care in diet when there is the 
slightest sign of indigestion or need for medical ad- 
vice. A simple presentation of the physiology of 
digestion would undoubtedly serve to show to mothers 
why the need exists for this care in diet under all con- 
ditions, whether of health or of disease. It is usually 
supposed by writers that every one interested in die- 
tetics knows that digestion is the process that prepares 
food for absorption into the blood, and that by assimila~ 
tion the different elements of food are selected for their 
work in the body ; that the teeth chew the food, and the 
saliva moistens it, making a beginning by partially di- 
gesting the starch in food, and that the stomach continues 
the work, followed. by the intestines. But a clear un- 
derstanding of the rationale of this process is very rare 
among the laity. Inasmuch as every alimentary organ 
has its specific work to do, it must be plain that certain 
conditions call for certain foods ; that when digestion is 
faulty or disordered in any way, advice is necessary as 
to which class of foods are to be withheld and which 
are to be given : as, for instance, in typhoid fever there 
should be no tax upon the intestines, and foods must, 
therefore, be given that are easily absorbed and di- 
gested in the stomach, such as peptonized milk or beef, 
white of egg in water, koumyss, etc. 
Mothers frequently err grievously in one direction, 
no doubt from lack of knowledge, in not seeing the 
advisability of total abstinence from food in cases of 
doubt, at least until a physician can be called. It is 
always the safest plan to follow, and it is the only way 
sometimes by which absolute rest can be obtained for 
the diseased parts, Fonssagrives says, “The number
-P-A-G-E-203
DIET IN ILLNESS (483 , ) 
‘of cases of disease which can be arrested in children 
by instituting a preventive diet is almost incredible. 
In them the digestive functions are in a state of activity 
proportionate to the need felt by their system for air 
and growth, and they are invariably involved in any 
attack of disease. What, then, is more natural and 
more salutary than to give them rest at the outset of 
an indisposition; but what is less commonly prac- 
tised? This matter of diet has, in recent years, been 
the subject of very important research, and it is now 
sufficiently cleared up; but what I do maintain is that 
it is a question of the very greatest delicacy, which 
embarrasses educated physicians themselves, and con- 
sequently could not be authoritatively solved in the 
family.”* Again he says, “One other piece of advice 
to mothers, not less salutary, is to restrict the treat- 
ment of an indisposition to diet alone. It almost 
always suffices for a cure, and if the attack must end 
in a disease, the ground has been cleared, the phy- 
sician’s action facilitated, and future complications 
rendered less probable.” He gives the following 
recommendations to mothers : 
“Do not give food, even light food, in a condition 
of fever unless the physician has recognized its pro- 
priety. 
“Treat indisposition by diet, and begin it as soon 
as may be. 
“Observe the effects of articles of food, and pre- 
serve the motions to show to the physician. 
“ Always ask the physician in regard to the interval

184 HOW T0 FEED CHILDREN. 
which should elapse between the food and the medicine 
prescribed ; feed children chiefly at their habitual meal- 
times, and give them only liquid food after four or five 
o’clock in the evening. 
“Tt is more important to preserve, as much as pos- 
sible, the regularity of a child’s meals, even when 
taken with an acute disease. If it is only a broth, it 
is better to give it at the usual hours of eating, The 
disease of itself breaks in sufficiently upon established 
habits, without our intentionally adding to the disorder. 
“Note the likes and dislikes of patients in the 
matter of food, and do not insist upon dishes which 
disgust them, Nothing is less scientific than the ab- 
solute specification of the articles of food to be given. 
The physician should designate classes of food so that 
the mother may choose, within their limits, the par- 
ticular article which the child most desires. It has 
been said with reason that a dish desired is half di- 
gested, and it is true of all ages. Yet it must: be 
remarked that those mothers who understand the 
matter direct their children’s alimentary taktes into 
almost any channel they please, or divert their repug- 
nances by artifices known to themselves. They have 
nothing to learn in this respect. 
“Give only food of the very best quality and pre- 
wed with fastidious care.” 
Another frequent source of trouble is met with in 
te effort to bring about an adequate comprehension of 
we terms liquid diet, light diet, convalescent diet, ete. 
Directions are frequently given to mothers and nurses in this general manner. Nurses are supposed to know what these terms mean, but many mothers need infor-
-P-A-G-E-205
DIET IN ILLNESS. 185 
mation in this respect. One might think a broiled chop 
and a baked potato constituted a very light diet, whilst 
another would think it should be corn starch pudding, 
tea, and toast. Referring to this subject, the late Pro- 
fessor Gross, of Philadelphia,—to whose utterances the 
weight of authority has always been accorded,—once 
said, “The diet of the sick-room has slain its thou- 
ands and tens of thousands. Broths and slops and 
jellies and custards and ptisans are usually as disgust- 
ing as they are pernicious., Men worn out by disease 
and injury must have nutritious and concentrated food. 
The ordinary preparations for the sick are, in general, 
not only not nutritious, but insipid and flatulent. Ani- 
mal soups are among the most: efficient supporters of 
the exhausted system, and every medical man should 
know how to give directions for their preparation. 
The life of a man is his food. Solid articles are, of 
course, withheld in acute diseases in their earlier stages ; 
but when the patient begins to’ convalesce, they are 
frequently borne with impunity and greatly promote 
recovery. All animal soups should be made of lean 
meat, and their nutritious properties, as well as the 
flavor, may be much increased by the addition of some 
vegetable substances, as rice or barley.” 
Directions should be specific if they are to be of 
benefit. Mothers should ask physicians for definite 
directions, and insist upon having them, and then 
follow them to the letter. 
The usual acceptation of the term liquid diet implies 
meat broths, milk, whether peptonized or not, beef 
juice, gruels, barley water, white of egg, mulled egg, 
whey, wine and water, etc., all of which are to be -

-P-A-G-E-206
186 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
given under the direction of the physician, as it is 
during fevers and acute stages of disease that they are 
required. It is a difficult and important matter to 
determine the kind and quality required during twenty- 
four hours, the intervals to be allowed, and the tem- 
perature of the liquid foods to be given. 
Light diet is the term usually employed to designate 
the foods to be given during convalescence, and consists 
of very simple and easily digested foods. Fresh-laid 
eggs may be used when changing from the broth diet to 
solid food. They should be cooked in hot water as 
directed on page 81. Fonssagrives gives a method 
that he asserts to be infallible for making the whites of 
eggs milky in cooking, which he says is the proof of 
good cooking and the promise of easy digestion. It is 
to have a tumbler (or a cup) filled with water brought 
to the boiling-point, in which the egg is to be placed ; 
withdraw the glass or cup from the heat, and take out 
the egg when it can be done without scalding the fin- 
gers. .Eight minutes’ immersion in boiling water that 
has been taken from the source of heat and covered 
will usually be found to serve the purpose. Something 
depends upon the freshness of the egg. 
Light diet consists of everything included in liquid 
diet, fruit, such as grapes and oranges, boiled or poached 
eggs, dry and milk toast, all the soups allowed in the 
nursery, delicate puddings, scraped beef, the tender 
part of oysters, jellies made with gelatin, either sweet 
with fruit flavoring or wine, or not sweet, using salt 
with meat and chicken broths, ete. The change to 
light from liquid diet should be very gradually made, adding one new food at a time. The following rules,
-P-A-G-E-207
DIET IN: ILLNESS. 187 
suggested by Dr. Napheys, should always be observed 
in preparing, cooking, and serving food for the sick: 
“All the utensils employed should be scrupulously 
clean. Never make a large quantity of one thing at a 
time. Serve everything in as tempting and elegant a 
form as possible. Put only a small quantity of an 
article on a dish at a time. Keep milk and other deli- 
cacies on ice in warm weather. Never leave food about 
asick-room. Never offer beef tea or broth with the 
smallest particle of fat or grease on it, nor milk that is 
sour, nor meat or soup that is turned, nor an egg that 
is bad, nor vegetables that are underdone.” 
Convalescent diet differs only from the ordinary diet 
to which the child is accustomed in its extreme sim- 
plicity and the small quantities allowed. One or two 
foods only should be used at one meal. Bread, fresh 
eggs, fish, oysters, meat, and cooked fruits and a few 
of the most easily digested vegetables are the foods 
from which to select. Remember that the sudden sight 
of food is sometimes an appetizer, and that a conva- 
lescent will often eat what is brought to him unawares, 
and refuse to eat what he has himself been asked to 
choose, or deny that he has an appetite when food is 
mentioned. 
The following is a summary of practical points for 
use with children, as suggested by the remarks of R. 
W. Burnet, M.D.,* concerning foods in illness : Drink- 
ing hot water at bedtime and cold or hot in the morn- 
ing before breakfast for dyspeptic disorders ;—a tea- 
spoonful of malt added to a cup of milk when keeping 
———_—_ ee

-P-A-G-E-208
188 HOW T0 FEED CHILDREN. 
up milk diet for growing boys and girls who are 
anemic ;—the use of additional cream in food as a 
laxative ;—in mucous diarrhea to use farinaceous foods, 
such as arrowroot, tapioca, sago, with milk, white of 
egg, to give small quantities of food at short intervals, 
to keep the patient warm, the food to be neither hot nor 
cold, to be eaten slowly, a teaspoonful at a time, to use 
brandy if physician advises, and to use meat juice when 
farinaceous foods will not do;—in kidney troubles, 
often following scarlet fever, etc., to feed very lightly, 
to cut down albuminoids under the physician’s advice, 
to use milk as a sole diet for children in this trouble, 
and for convalescence to give the usual nursery menus 
minus meat ;—in scurvy, caused by restricted diet, if 
fresh vegetables or fruit cannot be had, to use lemon 
juice (purées are a useful form for vegetables in this 
trouble, and all softer foods of nursery dietaries). 
Anemia may occur in connection with all diseases. 
For dietaries for anemic children any of the nursery 
menus given may be used, with a glass of cocoa or 
beef’ tea half-way between meals, and before bed a cup 
of peptonized or malted milk (a teaspoonful of extract 
of malt to a cup of milk), Cream added to whey is a 
useful food for children of consumptive inheritance. 
They should early have salts of tender meats, vege- 
tables, and fruits, a sufficient quantity of milk, open- 
air life, little study, and an abundant and easily 
assimilated diet. Bronchitis requires a liberal dietary 
of light, nourishing food. Diphtheria requires abun- 
dant nourishment. There is danger of overfeeding in 
typhoid fever: milk should be carefully taken, and it should be peptonized when used. In diarrhea, gelatin
-P-A-G-E-209
DIET IN ILLNESS. 189 
and arrowroot, white of egg and water, peptonized 
milk, ete. are useful. Special dietaries must be given 
by the physician, as each case must be individualized, 
and he should be able to select the kind of food re- 
quired and the form in which to give it, and also to 
direct how it should be prepared. 
Inasmuch as children are frequently poisoned by 
eating sweets improperly prepared, or berries, or seeds, 
or by sucking painted toys, their treatment under such 
conditions becomes a matter very closely related to 
dietetics. Jane H. Walker, M.D., says,* “The first 
and most important thing is to make the child vomit 
as speedily as possible, . . . to tickle the back of the 
throat with a feather, and give large drinks of luke- 
warm water, or of mustard and warm water. <A tea- 
spoonful of mustard in a tumbler of warm water is 
very efficacious. Greasy or soapy water, if it is the 
readiest obtainable, does perfectly ; soapy water has 
the advantage that if the poisonous substance taken be 
an acid, it is an excellent antidote. See that the child 
is repeatedly nauseated, and then give it bland sooth- 
ing substances, such as white of egg beaten up, milk, 
barley water, or oil. These help if the poison has been 
of an irritating character, such as carbolic acid. 
“If there is great depression, stimulants must be 
given and hot-water bottles applied. The best stimu- 
lant is strong hot tea, because it is an antidote to many 
poisons. 
“Te there is great tendency to sleep, it must be pre- 
vented at all cost. This tendency generally shows that

opium in one of its numerous preparations has been 
taken, and sleep indulged in at this time will probably 
be the sleep that knows no waking. When the poison- 
ous substance that has been taken is known, the method 
of procedure differs with the particular poison.”

CHAPTER XV. 
a Diet for School-Children. 
- Yxo emphasizes the period of schogl-life as one of 
‘the most critical and important epochs in the life of 
\ children as regards adequate nutrition. He says that 
at this period there is not only continuous growth and 
development, but remarkable activity, which demands 
a complete and liberal dietary. Teachers in boarding- 
schools are apt to overlook this fact, and parents, as a 
rule, know little of the necessity for additional care at 
this time, with the result only too often of the founda- 
tion being laid for future disease, or of the undermining 
of strength that should be held in reserve for later life. 
~~ Both body and mind are undergoing rapid development 
(whi time, and the greatest care should be exercised. 
~The food must be abundant, and must contain suffi- 
cient proteids, starches, sugars, and inorganic salts to 
_-meet the constant demand for these constituents of a 
perfect food. It must be remembered that this is a_ 
~-period when digestion and assimilation are active. It 
_is a frequent custom among mothers of growing boys 
_ and girls going to school to jest about their immense 
appetites, and not only to jest, but actually to limit sup- 
plies of certain foods especially needed at this period. 
The custom of sending children to school upon a light 
breakfast or none at all, with a cold luncheon for the 
noon meal, is reprehensible to the last degree, Or, if
-P-A-G-E-213
DIET FOR SCHOOL-CHILDREN. 193 
a hot dinner is provided, the habit of rushing home at 
noon in a limited time to consume eagerly and rapidly 
the food which should be eaten leisurely and enjoyed, 
has 2, strong influence upon the integrity of the child’s 
health, and it should not be allowed under any cir- 
cumstances. If school laws are rigid, remember that 
parental authority should be absolute, and insist upon 
different hours; or, if nothing better can be done, keep 
the child away for the time required, irrespective of late- 
marks, etc. Such action, if concerted, would speedily 
bring authorities to the point of meeting existing needs 
in this direction. Do not forget that there is a lifetime 
G study and only part of one during which the physical 
nilding-up process can be regulated. To sum up the 
rales laid down by Yeo, Dukes, Thompson, and others, 
the foods required during this period are as follows: 
..Well-made whole-meal bread; as much butter as is 
‘desired; an abundant supply of milk all through 
adolescence; starches and sugars should be freely 
supplied (giving heat and force); meat-twice a day; 
_ fish for delicate feeders; green vegetables in abun- 
dance, either alone or in vegetable soups (to prevent 
eczema); suppers should be light, not stimulating ; 
the craving for sweets should be satisfied with mod- 
eration and wisdom in selection ; a free use of salads 
should be made; all cooking should be carefully 
looked after, and food should be. made savory and 
appetizing ; in fact, the rules given by dietists for 
early life should be carried out through the entire 
period of childhood to adult life, and, indeed, many. 
of the suggestions may be followed with benefit even’ 
then, 
13 WN
-P-A-G-E-214
194 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
Dr. Thompson says many children inherit feeble con- 
stitutions, such as the scrofulous, rachitic, and gouty, 
which must be combated through the whole period of 
childhood. He says such children are better at home, 
where they can be under. constant observation and 
proper dietetic treatment, or country schools can be 
found for them where such matters are made the sub- 
ject of special consideration. He speaks of the large 
number of cases of anemia and chlorosis seen in young- 
girls during or shortly after the attainment of the con- 
dition of puberty, and which he says are directly trace- 
able to malnutrition from faulty diet. This fact may 
serve to show to some parents why Providence, as they 
say, has so frequently afflicted their growing daughters 
with delicate health, which is more frequently their 
lament than their shame. I think it was Shirley Dare 
who said that the day will come when many forms of 
illness will be considered a discredit to those involved. 
As the knowledge of causes increases there will certainly 
come a less ready willingness to credit everything to a 
hitherto much-abused Providence. The patience of 
physicians in dealing with this class of diseases is a 
constantly growing marvel. Inasmuch as Dr. Thomp- 
son * has covered the subject of school diet so thor- 
oughly, liberal quotations are made (with permission) 
in the interest of our readers. 
“Girls take much less exercise than boys as a rule, 
and are more apt to become constipated. This diffi- 
culty may be increased by lack of sufficient fresh vege- 
tables or fruit in their diet, and if prolonged it is

DIET FOR SCHOOL-CHILDREN. 1g, 
enough in itself to cause anemia. The latter (anemia)*. 
may also be brought about by insufficient good animal 
food, It should be the imperative duty of every head 
niaster of a school for children to realize the responsi- 
bilities of rightly developing the physical constitution 
of those intrusted to his care, and to make a thorough 
study of the questions of dietetics involved. 
“An important consideration in school diet is to 
/-prevent monotony, which becomes so common from 
economic reasons, or more often from carelessness. It 
is much easier to yield to routine and force of habit 
or to leave the matter to the indiscretions of an un- 
intelligent cook. But a little study and thought ex- 
pended upon this subject can always result in furnishing 
variety in a wholesome diet without material increase of 
expense, 
“The hours for study and for meals should be so 
regulated that sufficient time should be allowed before 
each meal for children to wash and.prepare themselves 
comfortably without going to the table excited by 
hurry, and they should be required to remain at the 
table throughout a fixed time, never being allowed to 
hastily swallow their food in order to complete an un~ 
finished task or game. An interval of half an hour 
or more should intervene for recreation after meals, 
in order that digestion may be well under way before 
any mental exertion is required. Constant nibbling at 
food between meals should be forbidden; it destroys 
the appetite, increases the saliva, and interferes with 
gastric digestion. .The number of meals for children 
should be adapted to the age of the pupils. For young 
children from ten to twelve or thirteen years of age it
-P-A-G-E-216
hoe HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
“may be necessary to furnish food somewhat oftener 
than for the older ones. 
“Tf children live at a distance from their school, or 
if they are weak and easily fatigued and inclined to 
sleep over in the morning, their hours for study should 
be so adjusted that they are never obliged to hurry 
their eating in order to be on time for school work. 
The teachers should consider themselves quite as re- 
sponsible for regulating this matter as are the parents. 
“Children should never be hurried off to school in 
the morning with an insufficient and rapidly eaten 
fast. Their appetites are often poor at this hour 
from the effects of an ill-ventilated sleeping apartment, 
and if they are subsequently kept at school for five 
hours without luncheon they will be very ill prepared 
for mental work. Or they ride to school without 
exercise after a hasty breakfast, take a hurried cold 
lunch at noon, and perhaps a warmed-over late dinner, 
and at six or seven o’clock a fourth meal, after which 
they are expected to study and go to bed. 
“Tt is being more and more realized by teachers 
and the public in general that the breaking down of 
health at school is quite as often, if not oftener, due to 
impoverished nutrition than to overwork. 
~* A fact which is often overlooked in the dietetic 
treatment of growing children is that their digestive 
processes are so active that the stomach is emptied 
somewhat sooner than in the case of adults, and, their 
meals being promptly absorbed, it is natural for them 
to become hungry if the intervals between the hours 
of eating. are prolonged. In some schools, children are given their last meal of the day at six o’clock in
-P-A-G-E-217
DIET FOR SCHOOL-CHILDREN. 197 
the evening, and they may not breakfast until seven — 
or half-past seven or even later, leaving an interval of 
over thirteen hours during which they have no food at 
all. The evening meal is usually made light, on the 
ground that they can sleep better, and it is therefore 
sooner digested. Robust children can, perhaps, thrive 
on this treatment, but those less strong are injured by 
it. For some school-children of from ten to fourteen 
years of age it will be much better to give the evening 
meal later, at say seven o’clock, and the breakfast at 
half-past six or seven, and if they awaken hungry 
during the night there is no harm in their having a 
glass of milk and a cracker. 
“Very delicate children whose appetites are poor 
and who do not do justice to their regular meals 
should be given an extra allowance of hot broth or 
hot milk, or an occasional cup of chocolate, with bread 
and butter and rusk, between meals. 
“These general rules are applicable in cases of chil- 
dren who, during one or two years, seem to develop 
with extraordinary suddenness and rapidity, growing 
sometimes two inches or more in six months and at- 
taining a height quite disproportionate to their frames. 
The demands of this rapid growth must be met by 
proper nutrition, or serious subsequent impairment of 
vitality may result. Such children should have their 
meals made tempting by good cooking and pleasant 
variety as well as an agreeable appearance of the 
food. 
“Meat which is carved in unsightly masses, and 
vegetables which are sodden and tasteless, will be 
refused, and an ill attempt is made to supply the 
1*
-P-A-G-E-218
198 HOW TO: FEED CHILDREN. 
deficiency in proper food by eating indigestible candy, 
nuts, etc. Children often have no natural liking for 
meat, and prefer puddings, pastry, or sweets when 
they can obtain them, and it is the more important 
that meat should be made attractive to them at the 
age when they need it. 
“Tt is unnecessary to discuss further questions which, 
after all, must be controlled by tact and circumstances 
of individual cases, and the line must be drawn with 
care between making a child too fastidious on the one 
hand in regard to the nature of its food, and, on the 
other hand, impairing its constitution by monotony of

A SAMPLE DIET. 
‘If early rising is insisted upon, a child should 
never be set any task before breakfast, especially in 
winter, and if it is not expedient to serve a full break- 
fast at half-past six or seven, the child should be given 
a bowl of hot milk and bread, or a cup of cocoa with 
a roll, or other light food; breakfast may be served 
later after the first exercises of the morning, and should 
be a substantial meal with animal food in the form of 
either fish, or eggs, or cold meat of some sort, with 
porridge. of wheaten grits, or hominy with milk or 
cream and abundant sugar, also bread and butter, with some sweets in the form of jam, or marmalade, or

stewed fruit. Dinner, which should always be served 
near the middle of the day, should comprise meat, 
potatoes. with one or two green vegetables, and some 
form of sweet pudding. The supper, it is generally 
admitted, should comprise only easily digested articles 
of food, and such substances as pastry, cheese, and 
meats are better omitted. It should consist of either a 
porridge with milk or cream, or a light farinaceous 
pudding of rice, tapioca, sago, and the like, with bread 
and butter, and some simple form of présartel or stewed 
apples or prunes, or very light plain cake, or 4 good, 
bowl of nutritious broth with bread or crackers may 
be substituted for the porridge or pudding. It will: 
sometimes be found best to serve ‘this’ meal, at seven | 
o'clock or half-past seven, and if hungry ‘the! ghild, 
may be given a slice of bread and butter and a cup of” 
weak tea or coffee, mostly hot milk, at half-past five or 
six o’clock. : pas 
“Children need fat, but they do not digest meat fat 
well, as a rule, and are very apt to dislike it. They 
will often take suet pudding, however, when hot mutton 
fat wholly disagrees with them. 
“Milk should be freely supplied not only in the’ 
1 form of puddings and porridges, but as an occasional 
, beverage, and children should be made to understand 
__ that when hungry they can obtain a glass of milk, or a 
\ bowl of crackers or bread and milk, for the asking. 
‘~ «Fresh fish, eggs, and bacon are all wholesome and 
serviceable foods for children, and meat, as a rule, may 
be given twice a day, but not oftener. It may some- 
times be advisable to give it but once a day when fish 
or eggs are supplied; it should, however, always be

given at least. once daily, and better twice to rapidly 
growing children. Large, strong boys require a great 
deal of meat, and its use should not be stinted. The 
larger boys may eat from seven to nine or even twelve 
ounces of cooked meat as a ration, although many 
children may not require so much, the smaller boys 
doing well with from five to six ounces, and the older 
boys with from seven to eight ounces daily. 
“During midwinter, when fresh vegetables are almost 
unobtainable in severe climates, vigorous boys are apt 
to hayé too much meat given them, and Yeo calls atten- 
tion to the fact that eczema may be produced in them 
hy a too exclusive animal diet. 
“ Overeating should be guarded against. The habit 
of slow eating should be insisted upon. 
“Tt is well to allow children to play but moderately 
immediately after eating and to require no mental work 
of them at-.such times. 
“For some reason the diet in girls’ schools is apt to 
be much less carefully regulated than in corresponding 
schools for boys. This applies not only in the United 
States, but it has been found the common experience in 
England and France ; it is the more unfortunate, since 
girls, from their greater delicacy of constitution, espe- 
cially at the period of puberty, require more careful 
nurture. Differences in habits and exercise and out- 
door recreation, no doubt, in part, are responsible for 
the comparative lack of proper development in some 
girls’ schools as compared with boys’, but this should 
be Teongnized and regulated with as much care as the

children to avoid stimulating and highly seasoned food, 
and eating late at night. . . . Alcohol should be 
wholly forbidden.” 
The British Medical Journal says, in commenting on 
an article in the St, James’s Gazette, on the question 
whether “ parents underfeed their children,” that “ it is 
only too true that underfeeding prevails,—particularly 
in the girls’ school; not the underfeeding of necessity, 
but the semi-starvation due to ignorance or meanness: 
(fie fact would be revealed at once, and the great 
j benefit be conferred upon the life, health, happiness, 
{ and growth of children, if we could impress upon 
ts and teachers the value of scales and m 
. Every age has its normal height and weight, 
and every season and every year its normal rate of, 
growth. The diet may be inadequate in proportion to 
the work required to be done, especially where work is 
yequired before food, as in early morning lessons. . . - 
Insufficient care is taken at home, and still more at 
school, to provide an adequate variety in feeding. It is 
often the same, day after day, week after week, and year 
after year. The ontery against the feeding at schools, 
which arises from time to time, is frequently to be traced 
to this defect. Most of the causes of the underfeeding 
of children, both at home and at school, would disap- 
pear if the scales and measure were systematically 
resorted to, for they would instantly point out those 
children who were not thriving. Unnatural and un- 
reasonable restraints would be removed by parents and 
teachers, if hindrances to growth were so palpably 
presented to them.”

BEEF JUICE. 
Remove all fat and tissue from a half-pound of lean 
beef; broil over a clear fire from six to eight minutes ; 
cut the meat into small pieces, and squeeze out the 
juice with a meat-press or lemon-squeezer. Add salt. 
When warming, put the juice into a cup and set it in 
hot water, that it may not coagulate, as it will do if 
heated in the ordinary manner. : 
BEEF ESSENCE, 
Put one pound of chopped. lean beef, with a little 
salt, in a glass fruit-jar or in one of the porcelain com- 
partments of an Arnold Nursery Cooker, and see that 
the cover is tight. If the jar is used, place it in the 
oven in a pan of water or in an ordinary Arnold 
steamer and cook four or five hours, Strain the essence 
through a very coarse strainer, one that will keep back 
the meat-pulp only. 
BEEF OR MUTTON TEA. 
‘This recipe is adapted from Burnet, and is efficacious 
in cases of anemia, One pound of chopped beef or 
one and one-half pounds of lean mutton (chopped) ; 
no gristle or fat; ten drops of hydrochloric acid, and a 
pintof water. Put the beef and acid in the water, and 
keep it covered in a cool place for at least six hours, 
or overnight if possible. Simmer for two hours, strain, 
and salt, Remove all fat when cool. It may be used 
cold, or, if desired, it may be heated in a cup m warm 
water.
-P-A-G-E-224
204 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
VEAL BROTH. 
Veal broth is nutritious, and is the only form in 
which to use veal in the nursery. Use one-half pound 
of minced lean veal to one pint of salted cold water. 
Let it stand four hours, then simmer slowly (it should 
not reach the boiling-point) for two hours, strain 
through a coarse sieve, and skim when cool. 
MUTTON AND VEAL BROTH. 
Use one pound of meat, half mutton and half veal, to 
a pint of cold salted water, and proceed as above. Bar- 
ley or rice may be added, a tablespoonful of either, well 
boiled. Milk thickened with flour is a pleasant addi- 
tion to the above or to plain mutton broth. 
CHICKEN BROTH. 
Cut up a chicken, bones and all, into small pieces, put 
them over the fire in cold water, add a little salt, and 
simmer for six hours. Cool, remove the fat, and keep 
the jelly covered in a cool place. This yields a very 
strengthening soup, which may be made the base of 
many a delicate dish for children or invalids. 
CHICKEN CUSTARD. 
Use chicken broth instead of milk, with beaten eggs, 
in the same manner as when making cup custard, sea- 
soning with salt instead of sugar. Serve cold or warm, 
with or without thickened chicken broth. 
Burnet strongly advises the thickening of broths 
with arrowroot, boiled flour, ete. They may also be
-P-A-G-E-225
RECIPES. 205 
thickened with gelatin. Chicken broth is especially 
nice when done in this way. 
OYSTER BROTH. 
Chop six fresh oysters and heat them in an agate 
saucepan, Jetting the liquor which exudes from the 
oysters come to a boil. Add a very little hot water, 
season, and serve after straining. This is very nice 
with buttered crackers. 
CLAM BROTH. 
Put a few well-washed clams in a clean pan in a hot 
oven, or in a steamer over a hot fire. When they open, 
drain off the liquor and add an equal quantity of hot 
water. Season to taste and thicken with grated cracker, 
if desired, or serve plain with buttered crackers. 
POTATO SOUP. 
Peel one dozen potatoes and one onion and cut them 
into small pieces. Cook them tender in a quart and 
pint of beef-stock, plain water, or vegetable water (page 
69), and rub the potato through a purée sieve. Add 
salt and a half-pint of hot cream. Beat lightly, and 
serve with bits of zwieback or dry toasted bread broken 
into small bits into the soup plate. 
SAVORY JELLY. (Adapted from Burnet.) | 
Take half a chicken, one pound of neck of veal, one 
pound of lean beef (from under the shoulder is the 
best part for beef tea, ete.). Separate the joints of the 
chicken, then cut all the meat—beef, veal, and chicken 
18

206 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
——into very small pieces; put the whole in an earthen 
covered vessel with two quarts of water and enough 
salt to season ; stew gently in the oven for five or six 
hours ; skim, strain, and keep cool. This is a very 
nutritious jelly, and it may be made very easily in the 
“Nursery Cooker” mentioned before. 
ROAST BEEF GRAVY. 
The thick brown essence in the pan, called ozmazome, 
should be dissolved in a little water after the fat has 
been poured off. It may then be thickened and sea- 
soned in the usual manner. Gravy made from fried 
meats must not be used in the nursery. 
A HOME-MADE MEAT POWDER. 
Dr. W. R. Huggard (Muenchener Medicinische Wo- 
chenschrift) gives a convenient method of preparing a 
powder from meat to be used as a nutrient. Lean meat 
is cut into small pieces; these are dipped into boiling 
fat for a few minutes, until the surface is browned, 
then taken out and drained ona sieve. They are then 
cut into fine pieces and dried in an oven for twenty- 
four hours with a slow fire. The meat thereby becomes 
dry and brittle, and may be easily ground in a coffee- 
mill. By this process of roasting it has lost four-fifths 
of its weight. This meat powder has a pleasant taste, 
and may be used in various ways, as in hot water, 
mixed with mashed potato, on bread and butter, as a sandwich, in soup, milk broths, etc. It is very easily 
digested, is tolerated by the most delicate stomach, and 
may be kept, if dry and excluded from the air, for a long time.

EGG CUSTARDS WITHOUT MILE. 
Ingredients required.—Four eggs, two tablespoonfals 
of sugar, the juice of an orange or a lemon, or a tea- 
spoonful of vanilla. 
Beat the yolks well with the sugar, and pour them 
into a double boiler. Stir over the fire until the mix- 
ture thickens, then add the flavoring and the whites of 
the eggs, which should have been previously beaten to 
a froth. Stir a few minutes longer, and pour into 4 
mould and cool. These custards may be made also 
with salt, meat juice, celery, or chicken broth for a 
pleasant variation. Inasmuch as there is always great 
demand for new dishes that are not sweet, it may be 
well to remember that this plan may be followed with 
tapioca, sago, rice, and many other farinaceous foods that 
are generally used in sweet puddings if used atall. It 
requires very little originality to make a palatable and 
wholesome dish of any of the above-mentioned articles 
without following the stereotyped plan of sweetening 
and flavoring. The following recipe is an illustration 
of this method : 
TAPIOCA WITH CHICKEN OR MEAT JELLY. 
‘Wash one-half cup of tapioca, and put it into & 
double boiler with one-half cup of cold water. Let it 
absorb the water, then add a pint of chicken broth, 
milk jelly, or any meat infusion, and cook until the 
tapioca is soft and clear. Season with salt, and mould. 
Serve hot or cold as preferred. For another change, & 
well-beaten egg’ may be stirred into the tapioca when 
it is taken from the fire. These moulds are very e™-

petizing when served with a little of the same broth 
or essence that has been used in making the jelly if 
thickened and daintily seasoned. 
A SAVORY BREAKFAST CUSTARD. 
Fill a custard cup lightly with bread crumbs, and, 
if convenient, add a little minced chicken. It is 
equally good without. Beat an egg, add a little milk, 
season, and pour the mixture into the cup over the 
crumbs. Bake in the oven in a pan of hot water for 
but a few minutes, as eggs must be lightly cooked to 
be digestible. 
POACHED EGGS. 
To poach eggs for the nursery, drop them in steam- 
ing water that has just stopped boiling, having added 
sufficient salt to taste before putting the water on to 
boil. Set the water containing the eggs back upon the 
stove. From five to eight minutes will cook them 
sufficiently. Eggs poached in this way and served on 
toast are further improved by the addition of chicken 
broth slightly thickened. 
CEREALS. 
Malted Gruel. (Adapted from Thompson.) 
Gruel should be well boiled and kept free from 
lumps, using a strainer if necessary. When cool 
enough to swallow, add a tablespoonful of malt extract 
to a pint of gruel. In a few minutes the gruel will become thin from the conversion of the starch into maltose, All farinaceous foods can be treated in this way.
-P-A-G-E-229
RECIPES. 209 
Oatmeal Gruel. 
Four tablespoonfuls of rolled oats, one-half tea- 
spoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of sugar (if directed by 
the physician), two cupfuls of boiling water, two cup- 
fulsof hot milk (or four cupfuls of water and no milk), 
Pour the boiling water on the oatmeal, salt, and sugar, 
if used, and cook in a double boiler for three hours, or 
cook in an agate saucepan for one hour, stirring fre- 
quently, if a saucepan is used, and adding water to 
keep to the original quantity. Strain to remove the 
hulls, and add the hot milk, bringing all to the boiling- 
point. If no milk is used, add all the water in the 
beginning. 
Two tablespoonfuls of oatmeal and two of Graham 
flour, with salt, a pint of water, and a quart of milk, 
make a pleasant change in gruels. Cook the water, 
salt, and meal for one hour in a double boiler or 
steamer; then add a quart of milk and scald or steam, 
according to the vessel used, for a few minutes only. 
‘Strain and keep cool. 
If gruels are to be malted they need not be cooked 
so long as for ordinary use. One hour in a double 
boiler, or half an hour in a saucepan, is sufficient. 
Barley Gruel may be made in the same way as oat- 
meal gruel, using barley that has been ground fine in 
a coffee-mill. 
Farina Gruel is made in the proportion of two 
tablespoonfuls of farina to two cupfuls of water and 
two of milk, with salt to season ; but it does not need 
long cooking, as it is partly prepared. Half an bour 
is enough for the whole process.

Arrowroot Gruel—One tablespoonful of arrowroot, 
one-half teaspoonful of salt, one cupful of milk. 
. Wet the arrowroot with a little cold water, add a 
cupful of boiling water, and boil ten minutes; then 
add the milk and bring again to the boiling-point. 
Strain and keep cool. 
Oatmeal Porridge. 
Three tablespoonfuls of rolled, ground, or crushed 
oats, one pint of boiling water, one-quarter teaspoon- 
fal of salt. Steam for two hours or longer in 4 double 
boiler or “ Nursery Cooker,” which is desirable for all 
preparations of cereals, and is especially designed for 
nursery cooking. The vessels in the “Cooker” are 
porcelain-lined, which is a great advantage. 
Oatmeal porridge is very appetizing when served 
cold in mould shapes, and it will frequently be eaten 
in this way when it would be refused if served in any 
other form. Wariations may be made by using farina, 
cracked wheat, browned rice (browned in the oven 
before steaming and moulding), hominy, arrowroot, 
etc., giving further change for older children by 
serving occasionally with fruit juice instead of cream 
or milk, 
Wheat Porridge requires two tablespoonfuls of wheat 
to a pint of salted water, and it should be thoroughly 
boiled or steamed in a double boiler or a “ Cooker,” two 
hours ‘being the shortest time to be allowed for the cooking of any porridge. 
Hominy requires the same proportions, and should 
be cooked for the same length of time. 
Cornmeal Mush (to be used warm or moulded, for
-P-A-G-E-231
RECIPES. 211 
supper or bréakfast, with milk or a little good syrup) 
should be cooked very carefully in a double boiler or 
steamer for the time given for the cooking of all cereal 
porridges, and it should be free from Jumps when done. 
A very good plan to follow when cooking co! 
or bran mush is to sprinkle the meal into a saucepan 
of boiling water from a. fine sifter, stirring all the 
time, before putting it into the steamer, as freedom 
from lumps depends upon the even admixture of the 
water and the meal. 
Farina Porridge requires three tablespoonfuls of 
farina to a pint of hot salted water, and it should be 
cooked at least an hour in the steamer or double boiler. 
Oat Jelly. (Rotch.) 
Four ounces of coarse oatmeal are allowed to soak 
in a quart of cold water for twelve hours. The mix- 
ture is then boiled down so as to make a pint, and is 
strained through a’fine cloth while it is hot. When it 
cools a jelly is formed, which is to be kept on ice 
until needed. Different proportions of this jelly can 
be used, but usually it is best to begin with equal parts 
of jelly and cow’s milk. When needed, this mixture 
is warmed and a little salt is added. 
CREAM MUFFINS. 
To make one dozen, beat up one egg very light; 
mix it with four tablespoonfuls of rich sweet, cream,’ 
alittle salt, and a scant half-cupful of milk. Sift in: 
slowly one and a quarter cupfuls of whole-meal flour. © 
and two teaspoonfuls of a well-selected baking-powder.
-P-A-G-E-232
212 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
Bake in a very quick oven (about fifteen minutes 
should suffice), putting very little batter into each 
muffin-pan, that the muffins may puff up and be 
nearly all crust, as they should undoubtedly be for 
nursery use, 
Graham and Cornmeal Muffins may be made in the 
same way, using Graham or corn flour in the place of 
whole-meal flour. . 
Cornmeal Muffins are delicious when made with 
half cornmeal and half hominy (breakfast hominy, 
well cooked). Stir a teaspoonful of sweet butter into 
three-quarters of a cup of hot hominy ; add the egg, 
‘salt, cream, and milk ; then stir in three-quarters of a 
cupful of corn flour and the baking-powder, and bake 
as directed above, remembering to keep the mixture 
of a consistency to pour easily, as in this way the 
muffins will be light and crusty instead of heavy and 
indigestible. 
APPLE BREAD. 
A very light, wholesome, and palatable bread is made 
of apple-pulp and flour. The apples are pared, boiled, 
and beaten to a pulp. The usual quantity of yeast is 
employed as in making ordinary bread, and is beaten 
with flour and the warm apple-pulp. It is allowed to 
rise, and in fact the process is the same as usual. Very 
little water is requisite. This bread is highly relished 
by children, (Household, of Boston.) 
sO MAPLE MOLASSES GINGERBREAD, 
. One cupfal of boiling water, a piece of butter the size of an egg, one cupful of maple molasses, one-half

teaspoonful of soda, one-half teaspoonful of ginger, 
two cupfuls of flour. Common molasses may be sub- 
stituted for the maple molasses, but the flavor will not 
be the same. (Household.) 
A WHOLESOME SPONGE-CAKE, 
First sift the flour and sugar. Whisk the whites of 
the eggs stiff. Beat the yolks of the eggs very light in 
a large bowl, then stir in very gradually the sugar and 
a tablespoonful of milk; add the whites, blending all 
well before gently stirring in the flour and a heaping 
teaspoonful of baking-powder. Bake in a well-but- 
tered mould for one hour in a moderately quick oven. 
The proportions for a small cake are three eggs, one 
and a half cupfuls of flour, and one cup of pulverized 
sugar. The batter should pour easily. 
RICE PUDDING WITH EGGS. 
As eggs should be cooked lightly to be digestible, 
they should not be added to farinaceous or milk pud- 
dings when first mixing, as is the usual custom. For 
rice pudding steam the rice tender in milk, using four 
teaspoonfuls of rice to a pint of milk ; allow it to cool 
for a few minutes before stirring in two well-beaten 
eggs, which should not curdle, but should be partly 
cooked by the hot rice. Sweeten to taste, and add 
vanilla, lemon, or any flavor desired. Grated nutmeg 
is very nice, Brown lightly and very quickly in a very 
hot oven. The above may be varied by pressing the 
rice through a purée sieve when hot. Add the eggs 
and flavoring, omit browning, and steam the whole 
mixture for only a few minutes in a double boiler.
-P-A-G-E-234
214 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
The yolks also may be omitted if a white pudding is 
desired, using four whites in place of two whole eggs. 
This need not be steamed after mixing if the whites 
have been beaten stiff. 
RICE PUDDING WITHOUT EGGS. 
Put two tablespoonfuls of rice into two cupfuls of 
sweetened and flavored milk, and set it in a moderately 
hot oven.. Stir every fifteen minutes at first, and every 
half-hour while the top forms. Any good cook under- 
stands the process, which, if carefully followed for two 
hours, produces a creamy, slightly brown. pudding that 
is invariably relished by children. A few raisins may 
sometimes be added for children over five years old. 
SNOW PUDDING. (Burnet.) 
Put into half a pint of cold water half a package of 
gelatin; let it stand one hour; then add one pint of 
boiling water, half a pound of sugar, and the juice of 
two lemons, Stir and strain, and let it stand, covered, 
in a cool place all night. Beat the whites of two eggs 
"very stiff, and then beat them well into the mixture. 
Pour into a mould. 
BREAD PUDDING. 
Soak one pint of fine bread crumbs in a pint of milk 
until soft, add three tablespoonfuls of cocoa dissolved 
in a little water or a dessertspoonful of vanilla for 
flavoring, three well-beaten eggs, a cupful of granulated 
sugar, and another pint of milk. Either plain or 
whipped cream is very good with this pudding.

BROWN BETTY. 
Alternate layers of sliced apples and dry bread 
crumbs, just enough crumbs to cover the apples. Add 
bits of butter, sugar, and ground cinnamon. Do this 
until the pudding dish is full, having bread on the top. 
Pour half a cup of molasses or milk and half a cup 
_of water over the whole, set the dish’in a pan of boiling 
water, and bake in a moderately hot oven for three- 
quarters of an hour. Serve with cream. 
FRUIT TAPIOCA PUDDING. 
Boil one-half cupful of pearl tapioca in one quart of 
boiling water until soft and transparent. Add one-half 
teaspoonful of salt and one-half cupful of sugar ; pare 
and core three tart apples, or three pears, and fill the 
centres with sugar and a little cinnamon or cloves ; put 
in a baking dish, pour the tapioca around them, and 
bake until the fruit is tender. Serve hot or cold with 
cream. : 
STRAWBERRY CUSTARD. 
Make a boiled custard with the yolks of five eggs, 
one quart of milk, one-half cupful of sugar, and one- 
half teaspoonful of vanilla. Crush and strain one 
pint of berries, and mix with them one-half cupful of 
powdered sugar. Gradually beat this into the well- 
beaten whites of four eggs. If the fruit is very acid, 
more sugar will be required. Serve the custard in 
small glass cups, and pile the strawberry float on top.

RASPBERRY BLANC-MANGE. 
Any blanc-mange may be made with fruit juice 
according to the following directions : 
Into a pint of boiling fresh milk stir two table- 
spoonfuls of corn starch made smooth in a little cold 
milk. While thickening, add two tablespoonfuls of 
- sugar and one-half cupful of raspberry juice, and turn 
into a double boiler, where it should be steamed for 
half an hour. Place in moulds (tiny cups are desirable 
for nursery use), cool, and serve with sweet cream. 
CHERRY JELLY. 
Use one pint of cherry juice instead of cold water 
to soak the required amount of gelatin; add the juice 
of two lemons, two cups of sugar, and three cups of 
boiling water. Some may prefer a trifle more sugar. 
Sweeten to taste, and seal in jars or tumblers. 
RHUBARB AND ORANGE JAM. 
Allow one quart of finely cut rhubarb, six Valencia 
oranges, and the same weight of sugar as of fruit. 
Peel the oranges, remove as much of the white pith as 
possible, divide them, and take out the pips. Put the 
pulp, half the rinds, and the rhubarb, peeled and cut 
up, into the scales, weigh, and allow the same quantity 
of sugar as of fruit. Then put all into the preserving 
kettle, bring to a boil, skim, and simmer for an hour, 
or until done, 
DATES AND OREAM.

whipped cream, and stand aside in a cold place for 
thirty minutes before serving. You will have a dainty 
and wholesome dessert that can be eaten by the chil- 
dren of the family. 
Dates and figs may be washed, soaked overnight, 
and stewed slowly, adding a little lemon juice if liked. 
JELLIED APPLES. 
Pare and slice thin a dozen or more tart apples. 
Place in a pudding dish alternate layers of apple and 
brown sugar, and a sprinkling of cinnamon, and when 
the dish has been filled in this way, pour over it one- 
half cup of water. Lay a buttered plate over the top, 
and cook slowly for three hours. Set in a cold place, 
and when ready turn out into a glass dish. Whip half 
a pint of cream and pile it up around the jellied apple. 
APPLE snow. (Adapted from Davies.) 
Reduce two apples to pulp, press this through a 
sieve, sweeten, and flavor. Have ready the whites of 
two eggs, beaten stiff. Beat the apple~pulp to a froth, 
and whisk the two together until they look like stiff 
snow. 
RHUBARB JELLY. 
To be made in May. Wash the stalks, and cut 
without peeling; cover with cold water avd simmer 
until soft. Then proceed in the usual manner, letting 
the juice drip through a jelly-bag ; do not squeeze. Use 
one pound of sugar (granulated) to a pint of juice, and 
boil fifteen minutes. Heat the sugar in the oven, stir- 
ring frequently ; add it at the end of the fifteen min-

utes’ boiling, and stir until it comes to a boil. Strain 
through cheese-cloth, pour into jelly-tumblers, and 
cover with melted paraffin, a second layer after the 
first has cooled. 
RHUBARB MOULD. (Davies.) 
One quart of red rhubarb cut in pieces, put into a 
covered saucepan. Let it boil until it is a pulp; soak 
half an ounce of gelatin in cold water, pour just enough 
boiling water over it to dissolve it; add to it the rhu- 
barb, with sugar to sweeten ; let it boil fifteen minutes ; 
add a few drops of essence of lemon. Butter a mould 
and pour in the rhubarb, Next day dip the mouid in 
hot water, and turn out on a glass dish, 
RHUBARB JAM. 
Rhubarb jam is desirable for nursery use, and may 
' be made in the proportion of a pound of sugar to a 
pound and a quarter of rhubarb, adding a little lemon 
peel. Boil one hour after the sugar has dissolved. 
ORANGE JELLY. 
Dissolve three-fourths of a box of gelatin in one and 
one-half pints of water; add one-half pint of orange 
juice, sugar to sweeten, and the juice of one lemon. 
Boil, strain, and cool, and keep covered until used. 
SAGO JELLY. 
Soak one cup of sago overnight in one pint of cold water. In the morning add one pint of boiling water. Boil in a double boiler one hour ; add one teaspoonful
-P-A-G-E-239

of salt, one cup of sugar, and one teaspoonful of lemon 
juice. (Trained Nurse.) 
PRUNE JELLY. 
Cover one pound of prunes with one quart of water ; 
cook slowly. Add sugar to sweeten, and one-half box 
of gelatin dissolved in a pint of water and boiled. 
Strain, cool, and keep covered. 
CLARIFIED APPLES. 
Prepare the apples as for sauce, in even-sized pieces, 
and simmer until tender in the boiling sugar and water, 
turning the pieces once, using a flat agate saucepan, from 
which it is easy to remove the pieces of apple without 
breaking them as they become tender. Use a half-pint 
of sugar to a quart of water for the syrup. Cook the 
syrup for ten minutes after the apples have been taken 
out, then pour it over them, sprinkle with cinnamon, 
and let them cool in the syrup, Orange or lemon 
juice may be used for flavoring. : 
APPLE WATER. 
Mash two large tart apples that have been sprinkled 
with sugar and baked tender and slightly brown, and 
pour over them a pint of boiling water ; Jet stand cov- 
ered in a cool place for an hour or two, strain, and use. 
IRISH MOSS TEA. 
Take a handful of Trish moss that bas been washed. 
and drained ; pour cold water over it, and let it simmer 
on the back of the stove until it is dissolved ; then strain 
and mix with lemon juice and sugar. This is said to
-P-A-G-E-240
220 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
be excellent in rheumatic affections. If oneis troubled 
with a dry, hacking cough at night, it will often give 
relief if kept near the bedside and frequently sipped. 
FRUIT SAUCE. 
Mash a quart of ripe fruit; beat it, sift a cupful of 
sugar over it, and set away ; if the fruit is very sweet, less 
sugar will be required. About ten minutes before the 
sauce is needed, set it over the fire and stir constantly 
when heated nearly to boiling, turn it about the base of 
the pudding, which has been placed in a deep platter. 
If the pudding boiler has a tube in the centre, as it 
usually has, there is, of course, a hole in the centre of 
the pudding, and this may be filled with the fruit 
sauce, which is, by the way, as attractive in appearance 
as it is delicious in taste. 
MARSHMALLOW DROPS. 
This is a confection greatly relished by many, health- 
ful and unobjectionable. It can be made quite con- 
veniently at home; if the best of materials are used 
and care is exercised, the product will be fully equal to 
any that the market affords, and it can be made at any 
time and in any quantity to suit the occasion. Few 
people have an idea of the ingredients used or of the 
manner of their use, but here is the whole secret: A 
half pound of gum arabic is to be dissolved in a pint 
of water 5 strain the solution, to remove any specks or 
organic matter contained in the gum, then add one- 
half pound of white sugar; place the whole over a moderate fire, and stir continually until the sugar is 
dissolved anda honey-like consistency is reached ; then

add, little by little, the whites of four eggs, thoroughly 
beaten, and stir the mixture till it becomes thin and 
will no Jonger adhere to the finger. The marshmallow 
factor is added by flavoring with as much tincture of 
marshmallow as may be desired. The compound is 
then poured into a tin or earthen vessel which has 
been lightly covered with powdered starch ; when cool, 
it is cut into squares, which are also dusted with the 
starch, and the process is completed. (Good House- 
keeping.) ORANGE SYRUP, 
Squeeze the juice of thin-skinned oranges through 
asieve, and to every pint add one and one-half pounds 
of powdered sugar and the juice of one lemon. Boil 
the syrup fifteen minutes, and skim as long as any 
scum rises, Strain it, bottle, and seal up tight, and 
it will keep a long time. Added to a glass of water 
it makes a delicious drink for an invalid. 
LIME WATER, 
Lime water is easily made at home for nursery use 
by putting a piece of unslaked lime the size of a walnut 
into two quarts of filtered water in an earthen vessel, 
and stirring thoroughly ; allow the mixture to settle, 
and pour off the clear solution as required for use, re- 
placing the water and stirring up as consumed. (Yeo.) 
RICE WATER. 
This is a useful drink in dysentery, diarrhoea, ete.: 
Wash well one‘ ounce of rice in cold water, then 
soak for three hours in a quart of water kept at @

tepid heat, and afterwards boil slowly for an hour and 
strain. It may be flavored with lemon peel, cloves, or 
other spice. (Pavey.) 
RICE MILK. 
Soak one ounce of rice for twelve hours, wash it 
quite clean, and drain it. Add the soaked rive toa 
pint of boiling milk, with half a teaspoonful of salt 
and sugar. Stir well and cook slowly for one hour. 
Rub through a hair sieve. Sago or tapioca may be 
substituted for rice. (Yeo.) 
BREAD JELLY. 
Take four ounces of bread crumbs two or three days 
old, soak in cold water for six or eight hours, then 
squeeze all the water out of it (lactic acid and other 
peccant matters are thus removed). Place the pulp in 
fresh water, and boil gently for an hour and a half 
to break up the granules of starch and promote its 
conversion into dextrin and glucose. Rub this semi- 
fluid gruel through a fine hair sieve; when cold it forms 
a smooth jelly. It will not keep long. (Yeo.) 
MULLED EGG, 
To be used in diseases in which the symptom of 
cough shows a certain degree of persistence, It is 
simply an emulsion of the yolk of egg in warm water, 
sweetened and seasoned to taste. It is prepared, as is 
well known, by mixing powdered sugar, the yolk of 
an egg, and a coffeespoonful of orange-flower water, 
adding boiling water gradually while stirring the mix- ture. (Fonssagrives.)

KOUMYSS. 
With a little attention to some important details, 
koumyss may be readily made by any one, the sole in- 
gredients requisite being milk, sugar, and yeast. A 
clean quart bottle is filled three-fourths full of per- 
fectly fresh milk, and to this is added a tablespoonfal 
of fresh brewer’s yeast, or one-fourth of a cake of 
compressed yeast, and a tablespoonful of white sugar. 
The bottle is thoroughly shaken, and then filled with 
milk to within two or three inches of the top, and again 
shaken. It is then tightly corked with a cork that has 
been softened by soaking in hot water, and for this pur- 
pose a corking machine should be employed. When 
the cork is driven home it is properly tied down. 
The bottles are now placed in an upright position in 
a cold place, at or near the temperature of 52° F., 
where they should remain two or three days. They 
are then put on their sides in a cool cellar or refriger- 
ator. Koumyss is at its best probably when five or six 
days old, but can be kept indefinitely at a temperature 
not exceeding 52° F. - (Frederick P. Henry, M.D.) 
WINE WHEY. 
Boil a quart of milk, add to it half a pint of wine ; 
put on the fire till it boils again, then set aside till the 
curd settles; pour off the whey and sweeten to taste. 
It is said that good country cider is as nice as the wine. 
(Trained Nurse.) 
BARLEY WATER WITH WHITE OF EGG. 
Take a tablespoonful of coarse barley and wash well 
with cold water, rejecting the washings. ‘Then boil for

an hour or more with a pint and a half of clean water, 
in a covered vessel or saucepan. Add a pinch of salt 
and enough sugar to render palatable, and strain. To 
four or six ounces of barley water thus prepared add 
the white of one egg. 
The value of this preparation in gastro-intestinal 
inflammation and irritation is not easily overestimated. 
In the enterocolitis (inflammation of the small intes- 
tine and the colon) of very young infants its exclusive 
administration for thirty-six or forty-eight hours will 
often relieve when all other measures have failed. (J. 
Hobart Egbert, M.D.)

CHAPTER XVIL 
School Luncheons. 
Tux editor of the well-known household column in 
the Philadelphia Ledger discusses the question of school 
lunches in a thoroughly practical manner, and as the 
problem is an important one in connection with food 
for growing children, I will give you the salient points 
of her article. 
_ She says: “So much attention is now being given 
to the scientific value of foods that no intelligent 
housekeeper needs to be reminded of the fact that 
age and occupation must be taken into considera- 
tion when preparing the daily menu for the mem- 
bers of her family. 
J é problem becomes an important one when 
we realize that upon the food of our children depends 
their healthful development, and that upon this depends, 
in a large measure, the future of the state. 
ee we know that the right food, chemically 
considered, and not the most delicious or tempting, is 
the basis of all growth, mental as well as physical, the 
importance of the subject in regard to children becomes 
overwhelming. 
“The majority of the children who are soon to be 
men and women, fathers and mothers, in their turn, are 
now being educated in our public achools, and threaded 
through and through the school communities are chil- 
dren who represent hundreds of thousands of homes 
16 . 225
-P-A-G-E-246
226 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
where proper food is never thought of, and where such 
a matter as getting a given amount of nourishment for 
a given expenditure is never considered. 
“Boston, some years ago, turned its attention to 
these facts, and, as a matter of experiment, decided to 
assume some control of the noon luncheons of the higher- 
grade schools. { It was hoped by this to improve the 
nutrition of children, and indirectly to improve 
home conditions, where the need existed, by educating 
the boys and girls to\a higher standard of living, cook- 
ery, and cleanliness. 
“Other cities, East and West, have watched the 
experiment with interest, and have offered the Hub 
the flattery of imitation more or less close, and in most 
of the higher schools are well in line for the new order 
of things.” 
The state of things in the Philadelphia Normal 
School for Girls is best described in a letter sent the 
Household by a woman in charge of the luncheons 
served there: 
“We have demonstrated,” she writes, “that the 
average schoolgirl, in spite of the fact that she has 
been accused of a special predilection for pickles, pret- 
zels, and sweets, does appreciate a wholesome, hygienic 
luncheon. A large basement room of the building 
has been fitted by the committee of the school with 
tables and stools and a long Iunch-counter at one end 
of the room. Other tables have been placed in the 
corridor in order to seat as many as possible, although 
the capacity is even now wholly inadequate. Another 
room with separate counters accommodates the’ pupils of the School of Practice.
-P-A-G-E-247
SCHOOL LUNCHEONS. 227 
“The success of the new arrangement has more 
than satisfied all the hopes of the committee of the 
faculty who have the matter in charge. Quarter before 
twelve Iuncheon is ready, four attendants standing 
behind the counter, to serve the students as quickly as 
possible. About five hundred buy either a part or 
all of their luncheon. 
“The menu each day consists of soup, cocoa, sand- \ 
wiches, milk, fruits, rusk, biscuits, and cakes of differ- | 
ent kinds, The soup varies each day, as well as the 
sandwiches and cakes. Great care is given to keeping / 
the soup and cocoa hot. 
“During the warm weather ice-cream was served 
every day ; now it appears but twice a week. Whole- 
wheat bread has been introduced, and is rapidly grow- 
ing in favor. Believing in the old adage of the horse 
who couldn’t be made to drink, the committee decided 
that some concessions must be made at first, and that 
only gradually would the more wholesome articles be 
given preference. That time is rapidly approaching. It 
is more often now that cakes are seen on the counter - 
after unch is over, where formerly it was sandwiches 
and fruit. 
“Since many students bring a part of their hunches, 
the food purchased does not, of course, indicate alto- 
gether the quality of the luncheon actually eaten. 
Fifty sandwiches a day seem # small number to sell to 
so many, but probably most of the girls bring this 
substantial part of the lunch from home. 
“Tt is the hope of those now serving the lunch 
prepare hot dishes other than soup for the same p 
in order to give as much variety a8 possible.”    
   
 
-P-A-G-E-248
228 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
‘The committee on hygiene of the Boston School 
Board (which committee, by the way, should be dupli- 
cated on every school board) went a step further in 
securing an order to the effect that only such food as 
was approved by it should be sold in the city school- 
houses. Then they placed the task of supplying suit- 
able lunches with the New England Kitchen (an insti- 
tution somewhat similar to our College Settlement 
Kitchen), and although at first private funds were 
needed, the experiment soon proved its success by 
becoming self-supporting. 
The beneficial effects of these simple, hearty lunch- 
eons on the mental vigor of the students and their 
appreciation of their value were practically shown 
during the school year and fully reported. A notice- 
able benefit was reported by the parents also. 
The Household editor says, pertinently : “ With all 
these favorable and encouraging results, why are these 
experiments not repeated in every one-session school 
in the country ? 
“Although our cities and towns do not yet admit, 
as those of the more paternal governments have done, 
that their responsibility for the children while in school 
includes the care of the body as well as of the mind, 
yet this responsibility is being somewhat recognized 
when the newest high-school buildings are planned 
with kitchen and lunch-rooms, But furnishing the 
equipment: is but the first step ‘in the right direction, 
and placing the work of supplying food in the hands 
of any one individual is but the second. Even should 
the city or town assume the financial responsibility of 
these luncheons, the plans would be incomplete with-
-P-A-G-E-249
SCHOOL LUNCHEONS. 229 
out some one to set a standard of quality and cleanli- 
ness, to insist that the food must be not only attractive, 
but of good nutritive value, suitable for the children 
and served in proper fashion. Some one, too, must 
have strength of mind to stand firm for the principles 
involved, even if the boys ‘go on a pie strike,’ a8 
happened in a neighboring city, or if the bakeshop 
around the corner hangs up a sign that reads ‘ Here 
you can get what you want, and not what the city says 
you must have.’ 
“ And the educational side is not the least of the 
work, while the mothers still ask, ‘Why are you not 
willing to sell pies?’ 
“The Iunch may be sent, as in Boston, from 
one central station, or it may be largely prepared. 
in the school kitchen, Each method has been 
successfully tried, and each has its own special 
advantages; but under either or any condition, the 
essential point is the maintenance of a high stand- 
ard of cleanliness and quality by some one with 
a broader point of view than is possible to the |“ 
person who comes directly in contact with the children 
at the lunch-counter. 
“ Te there any doubt that a broad~minded educated. 
woman is the one best fitted to hold that standard for the 
community, or that this work is worthy of her efforts ? 
“Tt may seem prosaic, and it will be full of petty 
details, but it has its inspiring side also in the 
consciousness that it may bring an influence of — 
far-reaching effect on the physical and, conse- 
quently, mental and moral vigor of the men and 
women of the coming generation.”
-P-A-G-E-250
230 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
Professor Dutton, in response to a personal request 
for the same, writes in regard to this question as 
follows : 
“ The lunch-room becomes at once a central factor in 
any well-conducted school. .” Its importance is increased 
by the fact that the breakfast is often too hastily eaten, 
and hence is insufficient to sustain the child during the 
entire morning. 
“The Horace Mann School is equipped with a 
lunch-room large enough to seat three hundred pupils 
at tables. Connected with it is an ample kitchen 
equipped with the necessary steam tables, ranges, urns, 
etc., for keeping food hot. The children in the ele- 
mentary school occupy the lunch-room from 11.30 
A.M. to 12 m.; the high-school pupils from 12.15 to 
1 P.m.; and after that the students of Teachers’ Col- 
lege are admitted. It is under the same general man- 
agement as the Columbia University lunch-room, and 
while the ideal has probably never been reached in 
such matters, the dietaries provided are nutritious and 
wholesome. Many pupils prefer to bring from home 
a portion of their lunch, as, for example, 4 sandwich 
or bread and butter, and to supplement this with a cup 
of hot soup or bouillon, with, perhaps, a cup of cocoa 
or a glass of milk. As the pupils enter the lunch- 
room each one takes a tray, and, passing along in 
front of the counter, takes what he desires, and 
pays for it at the cashier’s desk. The only thing 
needed is to secure greater perfection in the selec- 
tion and preparation of the daily menu, A com- mittee, consisting of the teachers, college physician, 
and the principals of the high and elementary schools,
-P-A-G-E-251
SCHOOL LUNCHEONS. 231 
has this matter in charge, and is working in oo-op- 
eration with the caterer. 
“The health of the pupils is singularly good, and 
the success of the school in its various athletic eater- 
prises is marked, Doubtless, some of the credit for 
this should be awarded the lunch-room. ‘The large 
expense devoted to this feature of the school is only & 
recognition of the principle, now 50 well established, 
that physical health transcends all other considerations 
in the rearing of children, and that a school must 
manage its affairs with this idea in view.” 
The growing interest felt now throughout the coun- 
try in the subject of the food and nutrition of man 
brings about the question: What place should this 
work take in the schools, and to what extent can it 
be introduced ? / 
In presenting the history of the movement that 
brought the teaching of cooking into the public schools 
of New York City (see Government Bulletin No. 56, 
. United States Department of Agriculture), I endeav- 
ored to show the pedagogical as well as the practical 
value of this branch of manual training. Dr. True, 
director of the office of experiment stations, says, in 
regard to the subject of instruction in cooking, that, 
this branch of manual training, as introduced into 
public and private schools, is steadily increasing in the 
favor of many school officers and of the people who 
support and patronize the schools. It has been found: 
possible to adjust the relations of the practical exer, 
cises to the general educational features, so as to main-" 
tain the interest of pupils in the mere routine processes 
of education, but at the same time to furnish them, with
-P-A-G-E-252
S52 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
some degree of practical skill and knowledge of direct 
suiility to them in the various industries on which the 
livelihood of the masses of our population depend, 
Much of this work has been done in co-operation 
with social settlements ; special effort has been made in 
the attempt to acquaint the public with the practical re- 
sults of such work, and such reports show the necessity 
of a more thorough training, from a broad standpoint, 
of teachers of domestic science. They also show to 
those who are vitally interested in the progress of com- 
mon schools in country districts something of the organ- 
ized effort which is being made to adapt the course of 
instruction in our city schools to the actual needs of the 
children. 
Would it not be possible for the hygiene committees of 
school boards to correlate the cooking school attached with 
the school-lunch question? Would it not be possible for 
cooking classes to be held at such an hour as to make it 
practicable to prepare the luncheons needed for the chil- 
dren, thus centralizing efort,and not only utilize the ped- 
agogical and utilitarian value of such training, but also 
keep in view the economical aspect, while providing the 
children with what, of necessity, would prove of immense 
benefit when considered from every standpoint? Such 
concerted work in the schools could be made to reach 
out and meet the efforts toward practical issues that are 
being made by associations like the Home Improvement Club, which is meant to improve the east-side homes in New York; the Household Economic Association, 
which does good work in the tenement districts in New 
York throngh its classes for teaching cooking; the Hartley House work and other similar efforts made
-P-A-G-E-253
SCHOOL LUNCHEONS. 233 
throughout the United States, notably that of Henry 
Tibbits in Chicago. 
Professor Dutton writes also in regard to school 
gardens and their corollary, home science teaching, as 
follows : . 
“Happy is the child born and nurtured in the coun: 
try, where grass and flowers are his ordinary compan- 
ions; where in field and forest he sees all kinds of life, 
and is daily learning from Mother Nature the rich and 
subtle lesson she has to teach. 
“ How difficult in town and city to make up this 
loss to children whose environment is a dreary waste of 
paved streets and houses of brick and stone. A box in 
the window or an occasional bouquet of flowers from the 
greenhouse is but a poor substitute for the grand out- 
of-doors which the country child enjoys. 
“Surely, a people so wealthy, so intelligent, and so 
generous, will soon devise some means of permitting our 
city children to experience and enjoy Nature in her 
larger and more health-giving phases. The school 
garden is likely to become here, as it already has in 
Europe, a feature of early: school life. In many of 
our larger towns and cities it is perfectly feasible to 
secure vacant lots of land at small expense for this 
purpose. In New York the problem seems more diffi- 
cult. With the transit facilities promised for the near 
future, it may become possible to institute weekly or 
bi-weekly half-days in the country for the boys and 
girls who are old enough to go, under the direction of 
their teachers. Large tracts of land should be leased 
or bought on Long Island, in New Jersey, or in Con- 
necticut, for school gardens. These gardens should
-P-A-G-E-254
234 HOW TO FEED CHILDREN. 
be in charge of competent persons. The planting 
should be widely differentiated, the simpler work being 
done by the younger children, and the more difficult 
and complex by the older. For such municipal effort 
for the betterment of children, trolley cars should be 
free. The vacation school problem would then be 
largely simplified, and its value greatly enhanced. Na- 
ture study would become real and not artificial. The 
child of the tenement house would know the world of 
his ancestors, and would have his choice of life’s 
opportunities greatly widened. 
“Tt is safe to predict that leading the growth of our 
cities out to Nature and up to Nature’s God will tend 
to promote health and happiness, and will lessen dis- 
comfort and crime.” 
Unification of effort and systematic basic work in 
school conditions could easily bring about such 2 con- 
summation, and every thinking person must certainly 
concede the necessity for such unification. 
When facing difficulties such as are already granted 
to exist in present food conditions of school children, we 
must find the quickest and easiest way out of difficulty in 
order to achieve results. Theory must be instantly re- 
duced to practice ; the lack of this is one of the crying 
evils of to-day in the study of home science, and a word 
of caution might well be extended to those teachers of 
domestic science who fail to keep the ends in view, the 
material they are dealing with, the means at hand, the conditions and fluctuations, the proper selection of means, 
and the proper application of means. :

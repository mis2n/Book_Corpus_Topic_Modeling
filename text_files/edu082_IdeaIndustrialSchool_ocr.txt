  TRANSLATOR’S NOTE 
HE present work of Georg Kerschen- 
steiner should be extremely acceptable 
to the educational world at this time. It is 
a concise and definite statement as to what 
is meant by industrial education. He was 
prompted to write it because of the danger 
of misunderstanding the real meaning of in- 
dustrial education both on the part of its 
opponents and on the part of its supporters. 
We have need in America of being reminded 
once again of the ideal that industrial edu- 
cation seeks to realize. 
The Appendix applies of course to work 
in Germany and should not be taken as a 
model for this country. It is nevertheless 
of great interest, showing what has been 
achieved with first-grade children in Munich, 
and it is for that reason that I have retained 
it in the English translation.

PREFACE 
N January 12, 1908, I was invited by 
the Board of Education of the Canton 
of Zurich to give an address in St. Peter’s 
Church in Zirich on the occasion of the 
celebration of the one hundred and sixty- 
second anniversary of Heinrich Pestalozzi’s 
birthday. I chose as my subject “The 
School of the Future in the Spirit of Pes- 
talozzi,”’ and I called this school an indus- 
trial school, What I had in my mind at 
that time I put in the form of a sermon, as 
suitable to the purpose of the hour and to 
the sacredness of the place. At that time 
I was not concerned with formulating logi- 
cally my ideas, but rather with touching the 
hearts of my hearers and inspiring them with 
an old, but still unattained ideal. 
It is four years ago since that took place. 
The expression “industrial school,” which is 
older than the works of Pestalozzi, has since

that day become a battle-cry. It was as if a 
sudden light had been shed upon the weak 
spot in our public school system, including 
our elementary and high schools —a weak- 
ness that had been for a long time more or 
less clearly felt. But that was only an illu- 
sion. For the numerous pedagogical mis- 
takes and contortions that that battle-cry 
brought forth in theory and in practice 
showed only too clearly how superficially and 
mechanically the spirit of the industrial school 
had been understood. It showed, too, how 
many ideas, vague and of doubtful value, 
began to cluster round the idea of an indus- 
trial school. I need only to refer here to 
the almost universal confusion of manual 
and intellectual work, or again to the effort 
towards concentration, based upon a false psy- 
chology, which proposes to divide up into 
a thousand pieces certain naturally united 
departments of learning, in order to present 
them to the student in a purely arbitrary 
connection without any real intellectual com- 
bining factor, “ guo omnis doctrina ingeniarum
-P-A-G-E-9
  Preface ix 
et humanarum artium continetur.’ (Cicero, 
“De Orat.,” III, 6. 21.) 
To try to correct these mistakes and end 
these contortions, the “ Bund fur Schulre- 
form”’ chose the vocational school, as sub- 
ject for discussion, at its meeting in Dresden 
on October 6-8, 1911, and invited Superin- 
tendent Gaudig and myself to read papers on 
the idea of the vocational school. These 
papers were to be followed by a free discus- 
sion, and it was hoped that this would help 
in making the idea clear and unambiguous. 
I accepted the invitation gladly, for it gave 
me an opportunity to give scientific expres- 
sion in a carefully prepared paper to thoughts 
which have been in my mind for many, many 
years. 
This work I am now publishing, and I 
hope that it will protect the development of 
our public schools, both elementary and high, 
from committing errors which would be far 
more dangerous than the sins of the old 
“book school.” This present work of mine 
is much longer and much more logical than

my speech of the rath of February, 1908, 
and a comparison of the two will show that 
here I give examples of what I mean, where 
formerly I merely laid down the principle. 
I was surprised that my speech of the 12th 
of February, 1908, gave occasion to a writer 
to claim for himself priority in this idea of 
a vocational school. Since I have never 
claimed the originality of this idea, I need 
give no answer. But I should like to state 
that the idea of a vocational school is as 
old as the theory of education. (Cf. Plato, 
“ Leges,” pp. 819 ff., Burnet’s Oxford Edi- 
tion.) Now ideas only become alive when 
they have been tested as to the possibility 
of their realization, by thinking them out 
logically to their consequences, and by suit- 
ing them to the forms of our present-day 
existence.

Idea of the Industrial 
School 
CHAPTER I 
The National Purpose and the Duties 
of the Public Schools 
OWARDS the end of the eight- 
eenth century and during the 
nineteenth century the public elementary 
school in Germany and in other countries 
became an instrument in the hands of the 
national or state administration — an 
instrument by means of which the state 
seeks to attain certain purposes or ends. 
Compulsory education is one legal ex- 
pression of this control of the aim of the 
school by the state. 
Now as long as we only pay attention 
to the aims and tasks of any existing 
B =

state as it exists at present, our scientific 
pedagogy will not be able to give us any 
satisfactory solution of educational prob- 
lems. But as soon as we regard the state 
as a product of evolution, as a community 
of people organizing for more and more 
useful purposes, a community that keeps 
trying by means of the activity of its 
members to make the way easier for an 
unhindered development of moral per- 
sonality, a community that is moving 
along in the direction of such an ideal 
state as the science of ethics would 
sketch for us — if such is our idea of the 
state, then the scientific formulation of 
the aim of the elementary school follows 
naturally from a scientific formulation 
of the aim of the state. 
A state that embodies moral ideals in 
its aims and institutions is the highest 
outward ethical good. For this is, as 
Locke, Hobbes and Spinoza have shown, 
a prerequisite in order that the individual 
may attain his highest inward ethical 
 
-P-A-G-E-15
Purpose and Duties 3 
good, in order that he may develop the 
real character of the free ethical personal- 
ity. Why, it is often just in working 
for the realization of such a national 
ideal that the individual finds not only 
a glorious and worthy occupation, but 
also a valuable opportunity to work out 
his own ethical perfection. This con- 
ception of the state is of course an ideal. 
To-day most states are very far from this 
ideal. They may be at times even a hin- 
drance to the development of personal 
ethical freedom. Very often a state may 
appear to the individual in its clutches 
to be the greatest evil rather than the 
greatest good. In his posthumous work 
““Weltgeschichtliche Betrachtungen,” 
even such a clever man as Jakob Burck- 
hardt allowed himself to sink to this 
statement, “The state is the greatest 
evil.” Now the question is, Must this 
be so? And the answer is that we see 
mankind forever building up new and 
better states on the ruins of the old ones.
-P-A-G-E-16
  4 Idea of the Industrial School 
Men are convinced that they are ever 
approaching nearer to the ideal of the 
state, as the safest retreat for ethical 
freedom, as the best guarantee for the 
inner and outer welfare of the individual. 
We firmly believe that history shows us 
a gradual evolution of the state along 
the lines of true culture and justice. 
This raises the question as to whether 
there are not other outward ethical goods 
as important as that of the state. Now 
if we cast a glance over the domain of 
the science of ethics, we notice many 
differences of opinion in regard to other 
things, but this at least seems to be un- 
questioned, that the highest and most 
perfect outward ethical good is the or- 
ganization of a community, which can 
make safe for each individual all that 
which is for him ethically good in accor- 
dance with his nature. Considering the 
criticisms, which my contentions have 
called forth from certain advocates of 
the so-called scientific pedagogy, it seems 
 
-P-A-G-E-17
  Purpose and Duties 5 
best to me to attempt in broad outlines 
a statement of my position. 
Each ideal, which we place before 
ourselves, should embody a possible con- 
dition for real beings, which can be 
achieved at some time or other in this 
world by human endeavour. This also 
applies to the ideal which we call the 
greatest good. Great difficulties will 
arise in the way of any attempt which 
tries to determine the greatest good for 
the individual as independent of outward 
conditions, as directly dependent upon 
the activity of the individual alone. The 
epicurean and stoical ideals were such 
attempts. Their ideals were achieved in 
a certain permanent state of mind, which 
was indifferent to the change of outward 
conditions. The state of mind in each 
case was of course different. 
We cannot rest satisfied with this 
belief in the self-sufficiency of the in- 
dividual. We know that man is by 
nature a social animal, that his mental   
 
-P-A-G-E-18
*“? 6 Idea of the Industrial School 
life is influenced on all sides by associa- 
tion with his fellow men, that he is not 
self-sufficient and that he cannot live 
alone by himself. Further, we must re- 
member that every vigorously thought- 
out ideal that follows from the univer- 
sal nature of man, contains in itself 
the demand that it must be universally 
desired, as long as we are going to set 
it up as a universal ideal. From this 
point of view, therefore, our concept of 
the greatest good will broaden itself out 
to the concept of an ideal state for a 
human community. Whatever aim we 
set up is a common good, which all men 
equally seek and by which each man 
may be benefited according to his inner 
needs. 
The aims of each separate individual 
are determined by the needs and desires 
of his mental and physical nature, which 
demands satisfaction and which deter- 
mines just in what the individual will 
find satisfaction. Such needs and desires
-P-A-G-E-19
Purpose and Duties of 
include the care for physical well-being, 
the control and use of natural forces 
necessary for that, the sexual desires and 
the bodily and mental care for the off- 
spring, the satisfaction of the social im- 
pulse by society, by love, by friendship, 
the pleasure felt in the approbation of 
others, the thirst for knowledge and 
freedom of thought, the pleasure arising 
from the beautiful and sublime, the 
activity of the artistic nature, the neces- 
sity for religious uplift and for the free 
inner formation of the ethical will. All 
these forces lie in man’s nature. They 
are the great forces at work in history, 
and from each one of these forces with 
ever-increasing consciousness of purpose 
the great practical ideals of each age 
have arisen, and history is nothing but 
the realization of these ideals — industry 
and commerce, the family, the education 
of the young, social intercourse, science, 
art and religion. Our universal highest 
aim must be put together with these 
 
-P-A-G-E-20
  8 Idea of the Industrial School 
elements. Each special concept of the 
greatest good must pay regard to them. 
We made the claim that the greatest 
good must be a universal aim; that each 
individual has his right to a share of it; 
that the aims of all must be at the same 
time the aims of each. From this it 
follows that in working for the common 
good each one will find his own satis- 
faction, and that he will of his own ac- 
cord follow the universal principles, by 
means of which he expects the universal 
aim to be attained. The organization 
of that social condition, which is set up 
as the highest aim, must naturally contain 
within itself the means for satisfying 
the individually differing characters, and 
offer every individual the possibility of 
finding satisfaction in a manner according 
to his nature, i.e. not just his superficial 
nature but his ethically developed one. 
Each individual aim or ideal is justifiable 
only in as far as it can be regarded as a 
part of the common aim. Now the satis-  
-P-A-G-E-21
  
Purpose and Duties 9 
faction, which is attainable by all in the 
same manner, lies ultimately in the cer- 
tainty that one is able to work for the 
aim that is far above the individual con- 
sciousness and its limitations, 7.e. for 
a humanitarian and universal ideal; and 
in the knowledge of one’s own value as a 
bearer of a higher ideal, as the instru- 
ment of a godlike will. Just here it is 
that ethics and metaphysics meet. 
This social condition, in which the 
aims of the individual coincide with the 
common aim, a society which I can im- 
agine as existing without legal para- 
phernalia, without orders and without 
prohibitions, this kind of a society I call 
a state. And as soon as it satisfies the 
previously discussed conditions, I con- 
sider it also the most ethical community. 
The other communities, such as the 
family, religious communities, etc., are 
of course necessarily contained in it, in 
as far as they are ethical communities. 
If this were not the case, then the numer-
-P-A-G-E-22
  10 Idea of the Industrial School 
ous aims.of the individual, to attain 
which he first of all comes together in 
smaller communities, would not be in- 
corporated in the universal or common 
aim. The opposition that has always 
been raised against my contentions rests, 
in spite of my repeated and lengthy ex- 
planations of my concept of a state and 
my idea of civic education upon a mis- 
understanding. I mean education, for the 
realization of the ethical idea of the 
highest outward good by means of ser- 
vice for the state. I do not mean educa- 
tion that leads to blind service of a per- 
manently rigid state organization. As 
soon as any one tries honestly to grasp 
this fundamental difference, any mis- 
understanding is bound to disappear. 
Another misunderstanding will also 
disappear — a misunderstanding that is 
common to those who believe the aim of 
all education to lie in so-called character- 
formation, or, as Gaudig expresses it, in 
self-determination, in the determination  
-P-A-G-E-23
  
Purpose and Duties II 
of “the ideal of the ego.” Now if you 
set self-determination as the purpose of 
education, you must also fix the aim of 
this self-determination. There have al- 
ways been educators who have seen in 
self-determination or autonomous char- 
acter-formation the purpose of education. 
The more the pupil develops, the more 
must heteronomous education retreat, 
t.e. in the best system of education, the 
educator himself becomes gradually more 
and more superfluous. But this purely 
formal end of self-determination can 
never give us a tangible aim. There is 
nothing really valuable for the individual 
himself and far less for the community 
in personality regarded merely as the 
sum of inherited and acquired character- 
istics. Their value first arises in their 
influence upon the personality itself and 
upon the community. These personality- 
values are as a matter of fact of very 
varying worth and form an increasing 
series up to the highest value of per- 
 
-P-A-G-E-24
    12 Idea of the Industrial School 
sonality, which seeks and finds its life’s 
purpose in giving itself up in striving to 
realize the common and highest good of 
an ethical community. The aims or ends 
of such personalities are contained in the 
common aim, which we have shown above 
to be the greatest good. It is precisely the 
possibility of working out the so-called 
“ideal of the ego,” in as far as this in- 
dividual ideal does not conflict with the 
common or universal ideal — it is pre- 
cisely this possibility that forms one of 
the most essential characteristics of the 
greatest and common good. From this 
discussion we see at once how useless it 
is to divide education into individual and 
social education. The aims of the in- 
dividual are necessarily contained in the 
general aim of the community, in as far 
as the community can be called the 
greatest good. There can be no ethical 
community without the majority of its 
members being ethical individuals. And 
further, there cannot develop a great
-P-A-G-E-25
  Purpose and Duties 13 
majority of ethical individuals, if the 
constitution and the general aim of the 
community are not based upon ethical 
principles. : 
I set up therefore this first hypothesis, 
that the ethical community is the greatest 
outward ethical good for mankind. And 
in connection with this there follows this 
second hypothesis, that a given state 
will progress in the direction of the ideal 
ethical community just in so far as the 
knowledge is spread abroad by public 
education that the highest outward and 
the highest inward ethical good stand in 
close relation to each other, and further, 
just in so far as all educational provisions 
are made from the standpoint of the 
ethical concept of the state. Conceding 
these two hypotheses, a given state will 
therefore determine the purpose and duty 
of the public schools in accordance with 
its own purpose and duty. Now the 
purpose of a state is twofold: firstly, 
an egoistical one, i.¢. care for its inner
-P-A-G-E-26
  14 Idea of the Industrial School 
and outer welfare and for the physical 
and mental well-being of its subjects; 
secondly, an altruistic one, i.e. a gradual 
working towards a state of humanity 
among mankind by means of its own 
special development to an ethical com- 
munity and by actively sharing with all 
its might in the work of that larger com- 
munity made up of all civilized states. 
Whether we may make these altruistic 
demands of every state at the present 
time, is of course questionable. I have 
discussed this point in more detail in 
my book “Staatsbirgerliche Erziehung 
der deutschen Jugend.” At any rate we 
may say that the altruistic aim cannot 
be of much value until the egoistic pur- 
pose of the state has been accomplished. 
Now when I say that it is the business 
of the public schools (including of course 
the continuation schools) to try to edu- 
cate the rising generation either by means 
of habit alone or by habit and under- 
standing, in order that it may help in
-P-A-G-E-27
  Purpose and Duties 15 
this double function in accordance with 
its ability, I do not thereby set up a 
utilitarian aim, but an aim that is in the 
first place and in the greatest degree 
an ethical one. 
I only call that man a useful citizen 
who serves his state always with regard 
to the twofold purpose of the state. 
Therefore it follows that I may define 
in a few words the purpose of the public 
schools of a state or the purpose of any 
education to be a training to useful citi- 
zenship. From this logically follow the 
duties of the school, and from these duties 
follows the organization of the school and 
likewise the organization of that type of 
school which we now call “vocational” or 
“industrial.” The ways and means to 
accomplish the separate purpose wholly 
or partly through a school depend upon 
the outer and inner conditions that in- 
fluence the physical and mental develop- 
ment of the pupil. From the sum total 
of these aims, duties, ways and means
-P-A-G-E-28
  16 Idea of the Industrial School 
follows the concept of that school of the 
modern state which I call a “work- 
school” (vocational or industrial school). 
Now if we follow carefully all the duties 
and organization of a school, which must 
spring from our concept of the highest 
aim of the public school, we notice at 
once that all other justifiable purposes 
or aims of education are also compatible 
with this highest aim. This aim—a 
training for citizenship — is in short the 
whole purpose of public education. 
It is obvious, for instance, that no one 
can be a useful citizen in our sense of the 
term who does not fulfil some function 
in the state organism, 1.e. who does not 
do some kind of work which directly or 
indirectly is useful to the aims of the com- 
munity. If any one in possession of 
bodily and mental health enjoys the 
blessings of the state organization with- 
out in some way or other helping ac- 
cording to his ability to further the com- 
mon aim of the state, he is not only not
-P-A-G-E-29
  Purpose and Duties 17 
a useful citizen, but he is acting immor- 
ally. If any one uses his inherited wealth 
merely to satisfy his own pleasures, then 
he cannot usurp the title of a useful 
citizen, because, apart from the payment 
of taxes imposed upon all alike, he does 
not bring any work to add to the common 
pool of industry, to which he really owes 
the comforts and luxuries of his life. 
On the other hand, even the work of a 
scavenger may possess ethical value, if 
it is carried out with a consciousness of 
the necessity of this work for the com- 
munity. 
The first demand of an individual in 
the community is this, that he be capable 
and willing to carry out some function 
in the state, or in other words, that he be 
engaged in some vocation, so that he 
may directly or indirectly further the 
aim of the state. From this we recog- 
nize the first duty of the public school. 
It must first of all help each individual 
pupil to choose some work or, as we say, 
ce 
   
-P-A-G-E-30
  18 Idea of the Industrial School 
some vocation in the community and to 
fill this position as well as possible. This 
is not yet an ethical duty, but it is a 
necessary condition, so that the public 
school may then turn its attention to 
ethical duties. 
The second duty of the school is to 
accustom the individual to look at his 
vocation as a duty that he must carry 
out not merely in the interests of his own 
material and moral welfare, but also in 
the interests of the state, which gives 
each individual the possibility of carry- 
ing out his work and of making his living 
protected by the law and order of a 
civilized community. According to the 
kind of vocation in question will it be 
easy, difficult or impossible to see in it 
a direct service in the interests of the 
community. There are a number of 
vocations where this altruistic conception 
surrounds them as with a halo. In 
regard to the others it will always be 
possible early to develop in the rising
-P-A-G-E-31
  Purpose and Duties 19 
generation a consciousness of the fact 
that each vocation can be looked upon 
as a necessary service to the community 
and that the undertaking of any paid 
work, however monotonous or modest it 
may be, carries with it the obligation 
of doing one’s best. 
From this follows the third and greatest 
educational duty of the public school. 
It must develop in its pupils the desire 
and strength in addition to and through 
their vocation to contribute their share 
so that the development of the state, to 
which they belong, may progress in the 
direction of the ideal of the ethical com- 
munity. 
These are the three obvious duties of 
our public schools, and they include at 
the same time the whole aim of educa- 
tion. Let us denote them shortly as : — 
1. The duty of vocational education, 
or the preparation for a vocation. 
2. The duty of teaching the ethical 
value of a vocation.
-P-A-G-E-32
  20 Idea of the Industrial School 
3. The duty of teaching the ethical 
value of the community within which 
the vocation is carried out. 
Since we cannot make ethical the com- 
munity without making ethical those who 
form the community, so these three duties 
of the school necessarily include the 
ethical training of the individual.
-P-A-G-E-33
  CHAPTER II 
The First Duty — Vocational Education 
HE first and most important duty 
of the public schools (elementary, 
continuation and high) is to give voca- 
tional education or to prepare their 
pupils for a profession. This seems at 
first to contradict absolutely the present- 
day conception of universal education. 
And yet no less a man than Pestalozzi 
was filled through and through with 
this conception, although the ultimate 
ideal of education that floated before his 
eyes was that of universal culture for 
mankind. Pestalozzi is never tired of 
emphasizing this first and most important 
duty, although he does this from other 
motives than the ones I have described. 
As the child of his generation he could 
not free himself from the idea that the 
2r
-P-A-G-E-34
  22 Idea of the Industrial School 
profession of his pupil was absolutely 
dependent upon the class in which he 
was born. Many parts of his last work, 
in which he collects the experience and 
educational ideas of his life, are full of this 
conception of the first duty of the public 
schools. The conditions at that time 
were much less complex than now, and 
it was only natural to believe that the 
inner organization of the elementary 
school should serve the aims of that class 
in the community to which the pupils 
belonged, and in which they would most 
probably remain. 
These conditions have changed greatly 
during the last hundred years. There 
are no hard and fast lines dividing the 
classes in a community. Industry has 
brought about so many changes in the 
conditions of the workers that we can- 
not conceive as possible a pure vocational 
organization of the elementary schools, 
whose aim is the vague aim of Pestalozzi’s 
universal human culture. To-day we
-P-A-G-E-35
    
Vocational Education 23 
feel it more than ever that the duty of 
the elementary schools is to prepare their 
pupils for some vocation. Now the vast 
majority of the members of any state 
are employed in physical work, and this 
will be true for all time. For every 
human community has need of many 
more manual workers than brain workers. 
Again, the ability of the masses is not 
such as is adapted to mental work, 
but rather to manual work, from which 
indeed in the history of civilization 
mental work gradually developed. Man- 
ual work is not only the basis of all 
true art, but also the basis of all true 
science. A public school system which 
has to prepare its pupils for mental and 
manual professions is badly organized, 
if it has no means for developing the 
manual abilities of its pupils. A further 
proof of its bad organization lies in the 
fact that in the development of the child 
physical development precedes mental, 
and that, especially between the ages of 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
  24 Idea of the Industrial School 
three and fourteen, the instincts and 
desires for manual occupations are un- 
doubtedly the strongest. I do not con- 
sider it necessary that arrangements be 
made for manual training (in addition 
to the bodily exercise required for health) 
in schools which prepare their pupils 
for purely intellectual professions, as 
is the case with a certain type of high 
school. Nor is it necessary for those 
who will in future life be almost en- 
tirely under the influence of intellectual 
motives and desires, when once their 
instincts for manual activity have died 
down, having achieved what is necessary 
in the development of the normal use of 
their limbs and sense-organs. ‘There are 
people of this sort and there are voca- 
tions into which they fit. I can there- 
fore conceive of a vocational school 
which has no manual training in any 
special workshop, or where no manual 
training enters into the curriculum even 
apart from special shop work. For all
-P-A-G-E-37
  Vocational Education 25 
other pupils, however, schools which are 
lacking in such equipment are badly 
organized schools. From our discussion 
we see at once that every elementary 
school must make arrangements for prac- 
tical work by means of workshops, 
gardens, kitchens, sewing rooms and lab- 
oratories. By means of these the in- 
stincts for manual activity will be sys- 
tematically developed; the pupil will 
be taught by actual practice to carry out 
his work carefully, thoughtfully, honestly 
and conscientiously. Only in this man- 
ner can a solid foundation be laid for his 
later vocational training by means of the 
continuation school, that is to say, by 
making him from the very beginning 
accustomed to do carefully thought-out 
and conscientious manual work. Or in 
other words, manual training in any well- 
organized public school must be recog- 
nized as an independent and legitimate 
subject of instruction. This recognition 
is not a degradation for the public school,
-P-A-G-E-38
  26 Idea of the Industrial School 
but rather one of the greatest blessings. 
For a hundred years in Bavaria a great 
number of girls’ schools have recognized 
manual training as a regular subject. 
For the last forty years Munich has 
devoted at least three hours per week to 
this. Never until the present agitation 
did any one dream of looking upon this 
instruction as a degradation of the girls’ 
schools, rior was any one willing to have 
it struck out of the curriculum of the 
elementary schools for girls. Some one 
may raise the objection that knitting, 
sewing, laundry work, etc, is in a way 
the vocation of almost every girl; but 
that not every boy takes up in this way 
the same kind of vocation. That is 
quite true. But we must not conclude 
from this that therefore the school has 
no right to include in its curriculum any 
kind of systematic manual training what- 
ever. If we make such a conclusion, we 
would also be warranted in arguing that 
because all men cannot. thrive on the
-P-A-G-E-39
  Vocational Education 27 
same kind of food, we should therefore 
give them no food to eat. 
A hundred years ago when the spirit 
of Pestalozzi still permeated German 
school organization, it was considered 
natural for boys, just as much as for 
girls, to have some kind of industrial 
training. These ideals were disturbed 
by the Napoleonic wars and pushed out 
of sight by the reaction that followed. 
Nevertheless, those ideas show to us at 
the present day a surprising knowledge 
and they are full of the most well-mean- 
ing, intentions. A decree of the general 
school board of the Palatinate of Bavaria 
issued to the local school boards in 1803 
gives us a good example of what is meant : 
“Certain technical accomplishments are 
more or less necessary for every person. 
It is therefore necessary to establish 
everywhere industrial schools for boys 
and girls, and for these to stand in con- 
nection with the ordinary academic 
schools. These industrial schools must 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
28 Idea of the Industrial School 
not excuse those pupils from attendance, 
who take it for granted that they do not 
need to work in order to earn their bread; 
for, apart from changes of fortune, 
through which many lose their inherited 
riches, it is always good for every one to 
learn how to value the privilege of being 
able to earn his living, and how to respect 
those who know how to acquire a com- 
fortable position by means of their in- 
dustry and skill.” Remember also that 
in those times the workshop of the father 
was in most cases in his own house. But 
the children of this generation, and es- 
pecially those in our great cities, grow 
up without any manual training at home, 
and in most cases have not the slightest 
conception of their father’s trade, and 
cannot therefore be seized with the magic 
of its blessing. 
The essence of preparatory training 
for manual work does not lie in introduc- 
ing into our manual training courses, tools, 
machines and materials that belong to a
-P-A-G-E-41
  Vocational Education 29 
definite profession. In the same way the 
essence of preparatory training for in- 
tellectual vocations does not consist in 
dispensing knowledge for a special pro- 
fession. In both cases the essential thing 
is to form and practise those organs, 
mental or physical, which are necessary 
for the vocation, to form habits of honest 
work, of carefulness, of thoroughness and 
of foresight, and lastly to awaken a real 
joy in work. If any one gains these 
qualities in any kind of systematic work 
(e.g. woodwork), then he possesses them 
and uses them in any kind of manual 
work which his vocation later may call 
for. It is just the same as with the 
student who has developed a logical way 
of thinking, conscientiousness and love 
of truth by means of a study of Latin or 
mathematics. He possesses these quali- 
ties and uses them later, perhaps not as a 
philologist, mathematician or scientist, 
but as a lawyer, historian or philosopher. 
From this primary duty of the ele-
-P-A-G-E-42
30 Idea of the Industrial School 
mentary school, z.¢. a preparation for a 
vocation, follows logically, in the organiz- 
ation of our school system, the demand 
for professional and systematically ar- 
ranged industrial training. This neces- 
sity is strengthened by the fact that the 
mental development of the masses, be- 
cause of the lack of special intellectual 
gifts, must undoubtedly take place 
through and by means of industrial 
training. Now these manual professions, 
and especially the skilled professions, 
because their interests are so closely 
bound up with the interests of the state, 
require a practical knowledge of the 
four primitive tools of culture — reading, 
writing, counting and drawing — which 
we might call in a way mental accomplish- 
ments. Moreover, we must demand 
bodily health and to some extent a knowl- 
edge of the laws of nature and especially 
of personal hygiene, and for this purpose 
gymnastics and nature study must neces- 
sarily be incorporated in the curriculum
-P-A-G-E-43
  
Vocational Education 31 
of our elementary schools. These are 
demands which we need not further con- 
sider in this book. On the other hand, we 
must emphasize this: the more closely 
the development of mental accomplish- 
ments can be associated with the develop- 
ment of manual accomplishments, the 
more perfect will be the organization of 
our school and the better will those 
mental accomplishments develop. If we 
could know very early what vocation a 
child would follow in accordance with his 
inclination and ability, if so many 
children were not dependent upon chance 
or custom in their choice of a profession, 
if interest in a special vocation did not 
develop so late or never develop, as is 
often the case now because of the indus- 
trial status of the parents or through 
other causes —if these hindrances were 
not in the way, then the best organiza- 
tion of our schools would be that in which 
the children would be grouped according 
to their future vocation. It would not
-P-A-G-E-44
  32 Idea of the Industrial School 
be right to make these schools merely 
professional schools, but they could be 
organized so that the most important 
part of the school work would be a prep- 
aration for their future vocation, and 
this we have seen is the first duty of the 
elementary school. Further, if the voca- 
tions prepared for by these schools coin- 
cided absolutely with the vocations of 
the parents, then an ideal organization 
could be realized. This school would 
not be something foreign and strange to 
the life of the child. It would not be 
something isolated from the daily work 
of his parents. It would be rather an 
educational institution that would include 
within itself the daily work of the child’s 
home, that would ennoble it and would 
shed the bright light of intellect around 
it. Then could the teacher, as Pestalozzi 
in his last work pictured it, so weave his 
teaching into the work of the child’s 
parent, as a weaver weaves a flower into 
his piece of cloth. But we have none of
-P-A-G-E-45
  Vocational Education 33 
these conditions at the present time, 
neither in our most purely agricultural 
nor in our most purely industrial com- 
munities. In most cases the elementary 
school must abandon this ideal of con- 
centration. But the continuation school 
must not do so. It can and must strive 
to attain this ideal to a great extent, and 
Munich has shown the world that it 
can be realized. 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
CHAPTER III 
The Second and Third Duties of the 
Public Schools 
HE second duty of all public schools, 
that follows from the general ideal, 
is the teaching of the ethical value of a 
vocation. The ethical value of all actions, 
which are considered right according to 
the conscience of any generation, begins 
at that point where these actions are 
carried out, either for the purpose of 
raising our own inner personality, or 
from an altruistic desire to attain some 
outer ethical ideal. To teach in school 
as conscientiously as possible, because 
one is appointed teacher and paid for 
the work, has no ethical value. To do 
the same, not for the sake of money, but 
because to do it otherwise would lower 
one’s own self-respect, has some ethical 
34 
 
-P-A-G-E-47
  Duties of the Public Schools 35 
value. To do it for the sake of the pleas- 
ure of the doing, for the inner uplift 
which we feel in this conviction, has more 
ethical value. To do it because one can- 
not imagine a more beautiful duty than 
in this way helping in the general uplift 
of mankind, has the most ethical value. 
The consciousness that our work, be it 
the slightest or the lowest, is carried out 
for the good of the community to which 
we belong, always adds an ethical value 
to our activity. To develop this con- 
sciousness in a school and to make it 
alive, there is no other means than 
what I have called the organization of 
the school in the spirit of an industrial 
community. Only in connection and in 
cooperation with the habits gained in 
this industrial community of the home or 
school can instruction in religion, his- 
tory and literature (the so-called ethical 
studies of the Herbartians) be helpful 
for a development of the consciousness 
of the ethical value of work.
-P-A-G-E-48
  36 Idea of the Industrial School 
This idea of the school as a free and 
independent industrial community has 
remained quite foreign to our German 
schools. It has only found conscious 
realization in some few elementary and 
high schools, either in the arrangement 
of the curriculum, or in the methods con- 
trolling school discipline, or in encourag- 
ing independent and voluntary work 
among the pupils for the benefit of the 
school itself. And yet it is almost a 
hundred years ago since Fichte in his 
“Speeches to the German Nation” told 
us that in industrial communities the 
coming generation would find its best 
educational means. For twelve years 
I have agitated for this and held up 
Fichte as an authority. I have pointed 
as a proof to the work of Dr. Lietz in 
his open-air schools and to John Dewey’s 
brilliant experiment in Chicago, which 
lasted unfortunately for such a short 
time. England and America have 
grasped this idea of an industrial com- 
 
-P-A-G-E-49
  Duties of the Public Schools 37 
munity much better. It is too true that 
even in those countries the real school 
training has an eye most of all to the 
development of the individual, as is the 
case in Germany. But we do notice 
in a great number of the schools of those 
countries that many questions of class or 
school discipline are intrusted to the 
self-government of the pupils, and the 
idea of a real community is further 
realized in many literary, athletic, scien- 
tific and artistic clubs or associations. 
We Germans have not yet sufficiently 
realized that school matters are of direct 
concern to the people. We have got 
into the hateful custom of being governed 
in all our educational affairs. Therefore 
we are still standing before this ideal 
without being able to show much activity 
towards its realization. We never even 
think of it on those very occasions when 
self-government by the pupils would be 
one of the most natural things in the 
world, ¢.g. at school celebrations. Such
-P-A-G-E-50
  
  38 Idea of the Industrial School 
a thing need not be hindered by the fact 
that the usual book training of our 
schools — our reading, writing and arith- 
metic, our history, geography, literature 
and. language teaching —is a very un- 
suitable foundation upon which to build 
up an independent industrial community. 
Something in this direction might be 
achieved in the two highest classes by 
means of adequate class and_ school 
libraries. Training in cookery and in 
gardening, real industrial training in 
workshops, in fact any kind of practical 
activity, forms the best foundation for 
the development of an industrial com- 
munity, and these things are found only 
too seldom in our public schools. Sim- 
ilarly, regular practical work in physics, 
chemistry and biology also affords the 
possibility of organizing communal work, 
and these subjects are nowhere compul- 
sory in our elementary schools. 
When I gave expression four or five 
years ago to this idea of school govern-
-P-A-G-E-51
  
Duties of the Public Schools 39 
ment, not the technical difficulties but 
the moral value of it was immediately 
questioned. It was urged that the best 
and most ambitious pupils would con- 
tinually obtain the leadership of the com- 
munity; that the great mass of children 
would be, as it were, hypnotized and com- 
pelled to follow, or else voluntarily trot 
tamely behind like a flock of sheep. 
Certainly the best boys would get the 
leadership, and they ought to have it. 
I have watched them often enough in our 
school exercises based on the principle of 
self-government. Why, it is just the 
business of the school to teach these 
leaders how to exercise the duties of 
leadership in the service of their weaker 
brethren! Would any one advise the 
breaking-up of the self-government of a 
nation simply because people can be 
divided up into leaders and followers? 
To the logical thinker this phenomenon 
is one of the most important reasons for 
introducing self-government into the  
-P-A-G-E-52
  40 Idea of the Industrial School 
school. Of course in introducing such a 
principle we take for granted a deep in- 
sight on the part of the teacher into the 
workings of such a community. We 
dare not form such communities before 
our pupils have attained a certain mini- 
mum of intellectual, manual and moral 
capability in the department of industry 
in question. Again, we should not bind 
together into the same community ele- 
ments which are too unlike, and we must 
always give careful attention to the great 
egoists, who always exist everywhere. 
Now and again we would take the leaders 
of all groups, in as far as we have organ- 
ized industrial communities in our classes, 
and form them for some special subject 
into another industrial community so 
that they would not continually have the 
feeling of special ability and power. And 
above all the teachers of such a school 
must be saturated with the spirit of an 
altruistic industrial community, which 
they form among themselves and along
-P-A-G-E-53
Duties of the Public Schools 41 
with their pupils. It is this last that will 
prove one of the greatest difficulties in 
carrying through this project. There 
may be a great deal of idealism among 
teachers, but an idealism that leads to 
willing sacrifices outside of scheduled 
school hours is, as is the case in all other 
professions, not so very common. 
If the spirit of the paid laborer domi- 
nates the teachers ofa school, pupils will 
never be influenced to band together 
into industrial communities outside of 
the regular teaching work, and if they 
should do so, such communities will only 
too easily be lacking in the needed ethical 
value. But on the other hand, if the 
pupils of a school are moved with the real 
spirit of an ethical industrial community, 
this very spirit itself will be the most 
brilliant testimonial of the inner ethical 
value of the teachers of that school. 
The springs of moral self-sacrifice run 
dry only too soon, unless they are con- 
stantly fed by the example of those 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
42 Idea of the Industrial School 
who make up the environment of the 
pupil. 
If this principle of an industrial com- 
munity is realized, we not only bring to 
bear the greatest forces in raising the 
ethical value of a vocation in the eyes of 
our pupils, but there will also be developed 
a whole mass of valuable qualities which 
could otherwise scarcely have been 
nourished in our ordinary school life. 
Because of the manifold points of contact 
with each other, into which an industrial 
community continually brings its pupils, 
there is developed a characteristic which 
I shall speak more about in a later part 
of my book. This is sensitivity or acuity 
of perception and feeling, which is in 
itself no moral quality, but which is of 
the highest value for the development of 
character. Furthermore, another moral 
quality, especially in regard to the best 
pupils, is put to the test in a way that is 
impossible in our present school system. 
I mean the consciousness of responsibility.
-P-A-G-E-55
Duties of the Public Schools 43 
Not only the leaders of the separate 
groups but each member of them is daily 
made aware of the fact that the work done 
is of importance for him as an individual, 
but also goes to make or mar the quality 
of the work of the whole group. Our 
present-day schools are hardly able to 
awaken the pupil to the idea of respon- 
sibility, far less are they able to produce 
in him a real live feeling of responsibility. 
If the industrial community of the home 
did not at the present time take unto 
itself the lion’s share in this regard, then 
this quality so necessary for a useful 
citizen would disappear more and more. 
Now a school must be able to awaken 
the ethical feeling of self-sacrifice by 
means of its industrial communities and 
the ethical instruction based upon these, 
before it can grapple with the third and 
last duty of a public school, 7.¢. the 
duty of helping to raise the ethical stand- 
ard of the community in which the pupil 
lives and in which he will carry out his 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
  44 Idea of the Industrial School 
vocation. This is the highest aim in the 
civic education of youth and must be the 
highest ideal of our public education. 
The important thing to be achieved here 
is to accustom the pupil as early as 
possible to work for some idea or ideal. 
The elementary school can do little more 
than build up this habit by means of its 
industrial communities. Attempts made 
by means of history or ethical instruc- 
tion to teach the pupils the duties of 
citizenship and the principles of ethics 
are on the whole useless. Our pupils 
are too immature and mostly lack the 
necessary mental intelligence. Greater 
possibilities in this direction are open to 
our high schools and to the higher classes 
of our industrial continuation schools, 
in which latter a more intelligent class of 
scholars are found because of the more 
professional nature of the work. For 
this reason, compulsory continuation 
schools where civic education is given, 
are a necessary consequence if we wish
-P-A-G-E-57
  Duties of the Public Schools 45 
to perfect the organization of our ele- 
mentary school system. How this addi- 
tion to our educational system should be 
arranged in order to fulfil its third and 
last duty I have described elsewhere.!

1912, Teubner), “Grundfragen der Schulorganisation” (3

hung der deutschen Jugend” (5 Aufl. 1911, Villaret, Erfurt). 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
  CHAPTER IV 
The Methods of the Industrial School 
HE foregoing discussion of the three 
duties of the public school, which 
we deduced from the ultimate aim of that 
institution, has led us to a rough sketch 
of the inner organization of the industrial 
school, as I called it in my speech in 
Zurich four years ago. However old 
the expression “industrial school” may 
be, yet I think I may claim that the 
content I have given it is different from 
any previous content. 
We have not yet exhausted the whole 
content of the expression in our dis- 
_cussion above. ‘Those three duties and 
the organization arising from them have 
shown us the direction in which the public 
schools must go to achieve this character 
training. From this we have obtained 
46
-P-A-G-E-59
  Methods of the Industrial School 47 
the first series of characteristics that 
arise from the idea of a vocational school. 
A second series of characteristics arise 
from the intrinsic nature of this character 
training. Now in investigating this we 
are standing on the threshold of the most 
fundamental problem in education. This 
is not a question of the aims to be at- 
tained, but of the physical forces in the 
pupil, which must be called upon and 
which must be directed. Which of these 
forces are unchangeable and which are 
changeable and therefore open to the 
influence of training? How must this 
influence be brought to bear, so that the 
personal disposition may be ethically 
developed and so that at the same time 
no valuable qualities may be suppressed 
or neglected? In a book of mine on the 
idea of character! I have sought to find 
out these physical forces and to group 
them together under a new concept, 
1Cf. Kerschensteiner, “Charakterbegriff und Charakter- 
gestaltung ” (B. G. Teubner, Leipzig, 1912).
-P-A-G-E-60
  48 Idea of the Industrial School 
which I have called the concept of the 
“intelligible character.”” There are four 
forces whose presence gives us the possi- 
bility of being able to train a useful 
character. These are strength of will, 
clarity of judgment, sensitivity and ini- 
tiative power. These forces or powers 
are like all physical forces not absolutely 
independent of each other. The last 
one in especial would seem to influence 
to a great degree the three others and is 
on the whole, I imagine, an unchangeable 
disposition. ' 
The development of the first three 
qualities demands above all freedom of 
activity and a coming in contact with 
ever-changing conditions. The will can 
only be developed by willing actions, and 
if the will is to be strengthened, it must 
have freedom in action. If the intellect 
is to learn how to judge clearly, it must 
as far as possible through experience work 
up its ideas and concepts. If sensitivity 
is to increase, reason and feeling must
-P-A-G-E-61
    
Methods of the Industrial School 49 
be brought early into contact with mani- 
fold experience in order that they may 
become accustomed to react quickly and 
in order that the variety of response may 
be great. The passivity and receptivity 
developed by our present-day schools 
hinder the development of these three 
forces, and very often direct them into 
other channels where the difficulty of 
guiding them ethically is greatly increased. 
It is of course true that the old battle- 
cry of Pestalozzi — “self-activity for the 
child”? — is continuously on the lips of 
our teachers to-day. Now this self- 
activity in the usual word and book 
teaching of our common schools is non- 
existent, and even where some self- 
activity does really exist it is bound down 
into a prescribed channel as far as the 
three principal psychical forces are con- 
cerned. It is unfortunately more like 
the self-activity of a machine than that 
of a productive worker. 
The slight influence of such a school 
E  
-P-A-G-E-62
  50 Idea of the Industrial School 
system upon the formation of character 
cannot long remain unnoticed. Our cul- 
tural, political and social life requires 
always more and more individualization. 
There is an increasing consciousness of the 
growing dearth of disinterested independ- 
ent men. The people as a whole are 
failing to grapple adequately with the 
problems that they have to solve. All 
these things show, as Lichtwarck has 
pointed out, that modern German educa- 
tion! is wanting in creative power. We 
are learning every day the importance of 
practical initiative, which cannot be re- 
placed by any other quality — of initiative 
that is governed by high ideals. This 
quality can never be developed in an edu- 
cational system that lays down an abso- 
lutely definite path which the pupil must 
take. And so the cry for introducing 
practical work within our schools is becom- 
ing louder and louder. First of all, there 
1This is equally true of American and European education 
in general. (Translator.) 
 
-P-A-G-E-63
  Methods of the Industrial School 51 
was a demand for manual training in the 
narrow sense of that word. Then there 
came the idea of industrial training, and 
at first it was understood in the sense of 
combining a great number of manual 
activities with all the conventional sub- 
jects of instruction. This conception 
of industrial education as being instruc- 
tion in mere manual work showed how 
little of the essence of the idea of indus- 
trial education had been grasped. At 
the same time a great many school direc- 
tors refused to recognize even this man- 
ual industrial training as a proper subject 
of instruction, and in putting it thus to one 
side they spoiled entirely the influence it 
might have had upon the formation of 
character. In three meetings of the 
German Teachers’ Association an anath- 
ema was launched against the incor- 
poration of industrial training in the 
regular curriculum. At the same time 
the movement for training the hand had 
caused many teachers to pay great atten-
-P-A-G-E-64
  52 Idea of the Industrial School 
tion to manual work in the narrowest 
meaning of the term. ‘This being the 
state of affairs, it can easily be understood 
that the new movement for real industrial 
training was a long time in establishing 
itself. The real inner meaning of indus- 
trial training had not led up to these 
efforts at manual work, although kinder- 
garten occupations, the training of hand 
and eye, the old demand for self-activity 
— all these things led to the recognition 
of the principle of industrial education. 
Since work is generally a manual activity, 
it was thought at first that the problem 
of industrial training would be solved 
by attaching some manual activity to 
each conventional subject of instruction. 
For example, it was thought that one had 
given the character of industrial training 
to history lessons in the higher classes 
by the modelling of old castles, by fret- 
work copies of old architecture, by draw- 
ing plans of battle-fields, etc. This new 
principle was made responsible for il-
-P-A-G-E-65
Methods of the Industrial School 53 
lustrating epic poems and biblical stories. 
Now just as little as you learn the cate- 
gorical imperative by drawing the por- 
trait of Kant, do such manual activities 
partake of the spirit of industrial educa- 
tion. All instruction, which must de- 
pend upon facts handed down by tradi- 
tion, as in history, religion and language, 
can only be useful for the formation of 
character by real intellectual work. Man- 
ual work is only useful where the ideas 
and knowledge arise from facts of daily 
experience, where the matter for building 
up images must be won from sense-ex- 
perience. All intellectual pursuits that 
have developed in the course of time 
have their specific method of work. The 
principle of activity is only then upheld, 
when the work of penetrating into the 
circle of ideas and method of thought of 
this subject matter coincides with the 
specific method of work, which has been 
developed with psychological necessity 
by this subject itself. There are many
-P-A-G-E-66
54 Idea of the Industrial School 
forms which the true principle of produc- 
tive work may take in different subjects 
of instruction. It may take the form in 
history of using accounts by contem- 
porary authors, of reading historical docu- 
ments, etc.; in literature by allowing the 
pupils to act and recite the plays and 
poems and thereby penetrate into their 
deeper meaning; in social communities 
by giving the pupils opportunity to de- 
velop their sense of refinement by means 
of social functions; in chemistry, physics 
and biology by giving the pupils a deeper 
insight into natural laws by means of 
actual experiments. All these methods 
use the activity that is specific and natural 
to the subject of instruction. 
On the other hand, it is not in accord- 
ance with our principle of work, if in- 
troduction to some manual technique, 
like writing or drawing, is prepared by 
means of other technical activities, as, 
for example, laying beans in rows, putting 
together chips of wood or clay-modelling.
-P-A-G-E-67
  Methods of the Industrial School 55 
At the present time these pedagogical 
misconceptions are so general as to be 
able to support large factories for the 
manufacture of school materials. Even 
Basedow had to acknowledge before his 
death that making letters out of dough 
did not help in learning to read or write. 
There are other methods which seek to 
divide up the work as these methods do, 
and lead to a development of percep- 
tion of form and imitation of form. At 
the same time they do not contradict 
the psychology of industrial education. 
These are excellently set forth in Maria 
Montessori’s “Il Metodo della Peda- 
gogia Scientifica.”! Mere manual ac- 
tivity, that pays no attention to the fine 
physical and psychical relations under- 
lying the activity, or to the systematic 
training of the will and judgment in 
connection with it, can form no criterion

-P-A-G-E-68
  56 Idea of the Industrial School 
for our industrial school, however much 
such activity may bear the stamp of 
actual work. 
Such manual occupations as we have 
described may be useful and sometimes 
indeed necessary as a means to demon- 
strate some lesson, or to train the senses, 
or to satisfy the strong impulse of the 
child for doing things, or to enliven some 
otherwise dull lesson. And yet we do not 
thereby introduce any new educational 
principle into our schools. The most 
that we are doing is to carry out an old 
principle that has been terribly neglected. 
But we do introduce a new educational 
principle, which up till now has been 
foreign to our schools, when we make 
manual activity a systematic tool for the 
training of the will and the sharpening of 
the judgment, and of course only employ 
it where the nature of the subject itself 
makes it seem necessary. This can only 
be accomplished when it leads the child 
at every stage to use his inherited capacity 
 
-P-A-G-E-69
  Methods of the Industrial School 57 
for expression to reproduce with precision 
what he feels, sees and thinks, and when 
at each step ever greater demands in 
exactness and skill are made. 
Industrial training as a principle and 
as a special independent subject of in- 
struction belong together as indispensably 
as the blade and handle of a knife. Wher- 
ever the demand for technical ability is 
recognized as a principle underlying the 
instruction, then a corresponding tech- 
nical training should follow as an absolute 
necessity. It is quite consistent to dis- 
agree entirely with industrial training, 
but to recognize it as a principle of method 
and to condemn it as an independent 
subject of instruction is absolutely il- 
logical. Since Pestalozzi’s time attention 
to oral expression has been recognized as 
a principle of instruction and also as a 
special subject of instruction. His de- 
mand of “every lesson a language lesson”’ 
would not have much use, if there were 
not at the same time special lessons for
-P-A-G-E-70
  58 Idea of the Industrial School 
training in oral expression. We do not 
only demand correctness in oral and 
written work in every lesson, but we 
devote a good bit of time to special lang- 
uage lessons. Now in the same way I set 
up eight years ago a principle that has 
been universally recognized — ‘‘No ob- 
ject lesson without drawing.” This prin- 
ciple would be of doubtful value for the 
development of the ability to draw or of 
the esthetic sense, if we did not at the 
same time have special instruction in 
drawing, which systematically teaches the 
pupils certain technical matters, without 
which their drawing would always re- 
main clumsy and amateurish. Again, if 
we acknowledged number as a general 
principle that did not need special in- 
struction and practice in manipulation of 
arithmetical rules, we would soon find 
that the vague content of the ideas of 
number gained in general instruction 
would be absolutely useless for forming 
clear number concepts. Again, we re- 
 
-P-A-G-E-71
Methods of the Industrial School 59 
quire systematic exercises to give the 
will power over the control of the muscles. 
Without such exercises our girls’ dances 
in the higher classes of the elementary 
school would remain forever on the level 
of the free play of the child. Now the ca- 
pacity for spatial expression as developed 
by manual work, looked at as a capacity 
possessed by the mind, does not differ in 
the least from the two other capacities 
of oral expression and expression by 
drawing. If any one considers it of less 
use than these two latter capacities in 
reference to the ultimate aim of education, 
we can, although with some difficulty, 
understand this position. But if any one 
values it highly and considers its culti- 
vation necessary for education, then he 
must surely draw the same consequences 
as he has done in reference to the two 
other capacities of oral expression and 
expression through drawing. He should 
consider it likewise worthy to be a subject 
of special instruction. These considera-
-P-A-G-E-72
  60 Idea of the Industrial School 
tions lead us to consider now a new fun- 
damental characteristic of the real in- 
dustrial school as a school for the forma- 
tion of character.

CHAPTER V 
The Technical Teacher and Professional 
Industrial Instruction 
HATEVER the school may take 
up in following out its aims, and 
in whatever manner it may arrange its 
subjects of instruction, the essential prin- 
ciple in the school is to lay increasing 
stress upon the careful carrying-out of 
all activity, by means of which will, 
understanding and sensitivity are to be 
developed. ‘The training of the will must 
lead to this irrevocable demand, that no 
work shall leave the hands of a pupil 
without bearing the mark of intellectual 
or physical effort. This is the great 
difference between the manual activity 
of the elementary school and that of the 
kindergarten, in which latter pure child’s 
play is the moving force in instruction. 
61  
-P-A-G-E-74
  62 Idea of the Industrial School 
The very worst influence in the training 
of the will is exerted, if children are al- 
lowed during their seven or eight years of 
schooling to form the habit in one, not to 
mention in all subjects of instruction, 
of doing a thing “‘just about” or ‘“‘al- 
most” correct. Nothing leads to this 
habit more than the recognition of in- 
dustrial work merely as a general prin- 
ciple, although this result is not logically 
necessary. For in ninety cases out of a 
hundred our general principle sinks to 
paying attention to mere trifles and 
fossilizes as we go up the grades into 
careless dilettanteism. The whole train- 
ing of the will is a summation of infinitely 
many and infinitely small efforts of 
voluntary attention directed in the same 
way. In the ethical battles of later 
mature life, that man remains the victor 
who is able to direct his voluntary atten- 
tion again and again to those ethical 
motives which set free the decision to act. 
Now we all know that it is much more
-P-A-G-E-75
The Technical Teacher 63 
difficult for children than for adults to 
concentrate their voluntary attention. 
And they are not learning this difficult 
task if they are again and again allowed 
to do their manual work “almost” right. 
And further, this is not the only bad 
result, but there creeps in the habit of 
being satisfied with their own careless 
work, in spite of all the imperfections 
which it shows. 
This danger can be averted by system- 
atic industrial training through the grades. 
It must strictly enforce care and exact- 
ness in all the work, which in turn must 
be suitable to the age of the child. The 
intellectual, moral and manual habits 
which are acquired by this training are 
unconsciously carried over to any manual 
activity that may come up in the other 
subjects of instruction, and they drive 
out harmful dilettanteism here as well. 
Children that have been so trained 
absolutely refuse to undertake work which 
they can only imperfectly accomplish.
-P-A-G-E-76
  64 Idea of the Industrial School 
The carefulness of expression that they 
have learned in their industrial training 
they try to carry over to tasks set them 
in other lessons in as far as their powers 
are able to cope with such tasks. 
Speech and gesture, drawing and model- 
ling (with any kind of material), are all 
methods of expression. They all serve 
in the training of the will and the judg- 
ment, only when systematic practice 
teaches the pupil to increase his capa ity 
for expression and accustoms him with the 
greatest possible independence to seek 
for the only suitable expression for his 
thought or his work. Right here do we 
find the essence of the principle of indus- 
trial instruction. The direction that our 
character takes depends upon how we do 
our daily work. Each bit of superficial 
work that leaves our hand, each time 
we let ourselves say, “That is good 
enough,” has an influence upon the de- 
velopment of our will. Now as long as 
the child is really playing, all doing by
-P-A-G-E-77
  
The Technical Teacher 65 
way of suggestion, i.e. not carrying a 
thing out conscientiously, is not only 
allowable but is necessary. For in pure 
play manual activity forms merely the 
basis for the free play of imagination. 
The products of any work have in this 
case only a symbolical meaning. They 
are not the aim of the activity. But the 
school must turn play into work, and 
here the products of work have real value. 
Here they are the declared purpose of 
the activity itself. Now since character 
is formed solely through action, it must 
be the chief care of the educator to see 
that all action should bear the stamp of 
thorough reflection, of the greatest con- 
scientiousness and of absolute honesty. 
It is not of any importance what we let 
our children do, by means of what 
technical instruction their manual skill 
and capacity for expression is developed. 
One or two technical subjects of instruc- 
tion are quite sufficient. The only thing 
that we must insist on is this, that the 
F
-P-A-G-E-78
  66 Idea of the Industrial School 
subjects chosen must allow the develop- 
ment of ever-increasing accuracy that 
can be controlled by mechanical means 
by the pupil himself. It is a crime to 
set up the principle of industrial training 
not based upon these two characteristics 
of accuracy and conscientiousness. In 
Munich we made experiments in indus- 
trial instruction in this sense of the term, 
and we found that even with six-year- 
olds this demand for the greatest possible 
accuracy did not in the least interfere 
with the joy of the work, but on the con- 
trary it seemed to increase enthusiasm 
for work from month to month. This 
has convinced me that from the very 
beginning we must carry out the work in 
this spirit. 
This being the ground upon which our 
principle of industrial training stands, we 
must naturally conclude that from the 
very beginning the free activity of man- 
ual and psychical forces must be made 
systematic. He who cannot control the
-P-A-G-E-79
  The Technical Teacher 67 
means of expression will never be able 
to express the simplest of things. Me- 
chanical practice in the systematic use 
of the means of expression is a pre- 
requisite for useful free activity or for any 
productive work. And for this we must 
make use of the instinct of imitation. 
It is interesting to note that those men 
who possessed the greatest gift for ex- 
pression, I mean our most famous artists, 
were at the beginning of their career 
practically nothing but imitators (e.g. 
Direr, Raphael). Their strength de- 
veloped by means of conscientious and 
untiring study of the means and methods 
of expression employed by others, until 
ultimately they gained that freedom and 
power that gave to us absolutely new 
works of art. The pupil must first 
have gained sufficient skill in the use of 
the means of expression before the 
teacher should give way to the initiative 
of the pupil, and even then this should 
be done gradually. And this is the 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
  68 Idea of the Industrial School 
second fundamental rule in carrying out 
the principle of industrial education. 
Of course this rule must not be taken in 
the sense of prohibiting all free un- 
hindered activity of the child. This free, 
unhindered activity is at the basis of 
all play. It is useful for stimulating 
thought about more serious activities ; 
and it may occasionally be made use of 
to let the child feel his deficiency in con- 
trolling the means of expression. For 
example, in the lower and middle grades, 
besides systematic work in drawing, it is 
quite good now and again to let the child 
give full reins to his initiative and draw 
what he likes. Yet we must never for- 
get that constant illustrating of stories 
and unsystematic drawing will very easily 
spoil such slight ability for drawing as 
most children possess. 
We have up till now laid down some 
such general demand as this, that for 
the sake of the formation of character 
the principle of industrial training must 
 
-P-A-G-E-81
  The Technical Teacher 69 
be carried out in mental and physical 
work. Further, our aim for the elemen- 
tary school demands that there.be in- 
troduced special industrial courses for the 
careful development of the purely practi- 
cal and manual capacities of the child. 
But it would seem impossible to demand 
of our teachers that they be further 
burdened with the acquiring and the 
teaching of some special industrial sub- 
ject. What conclusion must we draw 
from all this? Simply this, that in our 
industrial schools we must have besides 
our ordinary theoretically trained 
teachers a second class of teachers who 
have been technically trained. 
No other way is possible. For the 
highest grades of the elementary school 
such a teacher can be carefully selected 
directly out of some actual industry and 
given some pedagogical instruction later 
on. In Munich, Paris and Stockholm 
this scheme has been tried and has 
proved workable. But this is not a per- 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
  70 Idea of the Industrial School 
manent solution of the problem. We 
must ultimately have technical instruc- 
tors with the same normal school training 
as the ordinary teacher has. This is 
quite possible at any rate for the purposes 
of the elementary school (for instruction 
in continuation schools this would not 
be sufficient). The manual training 
high schools of the United States, which. 
prepare technical instructors for the ele- 
mentary schools as well as for the manual 
schools, prove my contention sufficiently. 
Such a normal school for technical in- 
structors would have to lay most stress 
upon a practical technical training, in- 
cluding physics and chemistry, in addi- 
tion to a thorough grounding in peda- 
gogy, psychology and ethics. The nor- 
mal school for theoretical instructors 
would include as it does now a training 
in pedagogy and the usual subjects of 
instruction. Both schools can _ easily 
come under the same institution, for the 
chief subject of instruction, 1.e. peda- 
 
-P-A-G-E-83
  
The Technical Teacher 71 
gogy with all its dependent subjects, is 
common to both groups of teachers. At 
the same time it would be of infinite 
value to the ordinary teacher voluntarily 
to give some of her time to a training in 
some manual work in order to develop 
her manual skill. Of course the technical 
instructor will teach all the technical 
‘subjects in the elementary school as 
well as drawing and laboratory work in 
physics and chemistry. Yet in as far 
as the rest of the school work is based on 
the principle of industrial training, i.e. 
in as far as industrial instruction enters 
into all the other instruction, manual 
activity will certainly play a part in the 
work of the theoretical teacher. She 
cannot afford to neglect manual skill, 
even although she is not so technically 
trained as to be able to conduct with 
sufficient thoroughness the special tech- 
nical instruction. If this way is chosen 
for the education of technical instruc- 
tors, no new element will enter into  
-P-A-G-E-84
  72 Idea of the Industrial School 
the elementary school, and at the same 
time the training of instructors for special 
purposes can be much more thoroughly 
accomplished. It has always been a 
puzzle to me how elementary teachers, in 
contradistinction to high school teachers, 
are able in one and the same breath to 
demand instruction in new departments 
of knowledge and technique and at the 
same time an essential deepening of their 
education. These two demands are really 
diametrically opposed to each other. 
This demand for technical teachers 
contributes no new factor to the ele- 
mentary school. We have had the same 
thing in our girls’ schools for at least a 
century, where technical lady instruc- 
tors and ordinary teachers have been 
working together. France, England, 
Sweden and the United States have 
technical teachers in their boys’ schools 
as well. Where there are no special 
normal schools for technical teachers, as 
in France, professional technical workers
-P-A-G-E-85
  The Technical Teacher 73 
are often appointed to give instruction in 
the higher grades. 
In the eighteenth general meeting of 
the Bavarian Teachers’ Association at 
Regensburg, Gutmann said, “The great- 
est mistake that can be made is to intro- 
duce into our schools in addition to 
the conventional subjects of instruction 
technical subjects taught by technical 
workers.” This conscientious but ob- 
stinate opponent of the industrial school 
knows very well that our normal school 
course cannot support any more subjects 
of instruction. The curriculum needs 
rather to be lightened. And yet rather 
than draw the conclusion that the burden 
could better be borne by two pairs of 
shoulders, he disapproves of the idea of 
introducing any kind of professional in- 
dustial instructors. If that is so, then 
educational fallacies on the part of boards 
of education have led to the appoint- 
ment of technical teachers for dressmak- 
ing and cookery. We must banish from
-P-A-G-E-86
  74 Idea of the Industrial School 
the German schools their numerous draw- 
ing teachers, from the Swedish schools 
their excellent gymnastic instructors, 
from the American schools their numerous 
singing teachers, and all the different types 
of special teachers for housekeeping 
such as I sa'w at Glasgow and Edinburgh. 
According to this man’s reasoning, we 
must make out of every teacher a skilled 
mechanic, a gymnast, a singer, a drawer, 
and so on in addition to the usual de- 
mands that he shall study science, geog- 
raphy, history and languages. The Ger- 
man teacher must understand this neces- 
sity for special technical instructors, and 
unless he is willing to welcome them he 
cannot hope for a deeper training in his 
own department. The industrial school 
is the school of the future. It will come 
and it must come in spite of all opposi- 
tion. Whether it will develop into a 
blessing or a curse for our people will 
depend upon whether we install tech- 
nical teachers in our schools who will
-P-A-G-E-87
  
The Technical Teacher a5 
bring with them conscientious, honest 
manual work which they have learned 
how to perform through long years of 
experience. The technically trained 
teacher is the logical consequence of the 
demand that our elementary school should 
provide for a training towards ethical 
character in the great mass of children, 
whose intellectual powers are not suffi- 
cient to make intellectual work alone 
the school for the formation of character. 
Our special or auxiliary schools, in 
which very often the instruction in man- 
ual work never rises above the level of 
play, could also be much better organized, 
if we could supplant the present-day 
dilettante by the technically trained in- 
structor. 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
CHAPTER VI 
Summary and Conclusion 
T is the great desire of all earnest 
reformers of our day to make the 
elementary school an instrument for the 
formation of character, even for the 
great majority of intellectually weak 
individuals. The experience of past cen- 
turies has taught us and is still teaching 
us that the cultivation of that memory 
knowledge, which is the predominating 
spirit in our present-day elementary and 
high schools, will never lead to the build- 
ing-up of that kind of individual which 
modern states have more need of every 
day. That experience has taught us 
that emphasis must be laid less upon the 
cramming in of knowledge and more 
upon the development of intellectual, 
moral and manual abilities; that our 
76
-P-A-G-E-89
    Summary and Conclusion 77 
schools must develop the mechanical 
abilities, inculcating at the same time a 
true knowledge of their uses, so that we 
may have at all times honest and con- 
scientious workers to carry out and per- 
fect the work conceived by the creative 
mind; and lastly we have learned that 
this way is the only way to educate the 
greater part of the nation so as to pro- 
duce men and women endowed with 
strong and honest wills. 
The industrial school is an organization 
which places the formation of character 
above everything else. Just because this 
is its chief purpose, it tries to arrange a 
curriculum that will banish from the 
schools the overcrowding and the super- 
ficialness of knowledge that goes along 
with this. The organization of such a 
school will arrange its instruction so as 
to allow the child to get most of its 
knowledge through experience, and by 
this very means builds up a strong defense 
against the overburdening by too much 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
  78 Idea of the Industrial School 
traditional knowledge. The idea of the 
industrial school is by means of a mini- 
mum of knowledge to build up a useful 
citizen endowed with a maximum of skill, 
ability and joy in work. 
Starting from the highest outward ethi- 
cal good of a community, from the ideal 
cultural and just state of ethics, we have 
found that each elementary school has 
three and only three principal problems 
to solve: 
1. Preparation of the individual for 
his future vocation in the community. 
2. The making ethical of this vocation. 
3. To make the individual able to 
join in the common work of raising the 
ethical standard of the community of 
which he is a member. 
This determines the ethical side of the 
educational duty of school. This de- 
termines the direction which the school 
has to take in the formation of character. 
Two chief conclusions follow: The prin- 
ciple of industrial communities and the
-P-A-G-E-91
  Summary and Conclusion 79 
recognition of industrial training as a 
special subject of instruction. We have 
seen that this demand for the formation of 
character is a demand for the training of 
a strong will and a clear judgment and 
that this requires freedom and variety 
of activity in all subjects of instruction. 
In all departments of empirical knowl- 
edge we must abandon the methods of 
present-day instruction and change them 
into methods of personal observation 
and experience. Further, the principle 
of industrial training in as far as it in- 
cludes manual activity must not be me- 
chanically carried over and applied to the 
conventional subjects of traditional 
knowledge. We have further seen that 
this principle of industrial training, if it 
is not to lead to mere superficial work and 
thereby become dangerous, but is to be 
really useful in the formation of character, 
requires recognition as a special subject of 
instruction and requires also a new type of 
teacher, the technically trained instructor. 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
  80 Idea of the Industrial School 
Last of all we have been taught this 
ultimate and most important fact, that 
the basis of all training of character lies 
in the development of a sound judgment, 
or, what is the same thing, in the ability 
to think logically. This can only be 
attained by independent intellectual work. 
Independent intellectual work is more a 
characteristic of the industrial school 
than is independent manual work. Only, 
we must bear in mind that in the ele- 
mentary school the boundaries of such 
work cannot be set very wide. Neverthe- 
less, this remains the most essential char- 
acteristic of the industrial school. Man- 
ual work even in the elementary school 
must encourage independent intellectual 
activity. This necessitates an abandon- 
ment of the old methods of dispensing 
knowledge in favor of an active working- 
up of all material for knowledge, where- 
ever and as far as it is possible. This 
means an essential curtailment of the 
number of subjects in our curriculum,
-P-A-G-E-93
  Summary and Conclusion 81 
the introduction of suitable places for 
intellectual work and of libraries for 
history, geography, natural history and 
nature study, and lastly a corresponding 
intellectual training for our ordinary 
and for our technical instructors. To 
change our habits of empirical thinking 
into habits of logical or scientific think- 
ing — that is the fundamental character- 
istic of the industrial school just as it is a 
fundamental necessity in the formation 
of real character. 
That exhausts for me the necessary 
attributes of the concept of the indus- 
trial school. We can see at once that 
this new school does not mean a com- 
plete break with the past, that it does 
not demand the impossible and that all 
the good that our present schools bring 
us will find ample room in the school of 
the future. Any other demands that 
the new school may make will come from 
the didactical side. Now didactical ques- 
tions are partly questions of child psy- 
G 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
  82 Idea of the Industrial School 
chology, partly questions of opinion, 
partly questions that depend upon local, 
temporal, economic or other conditions. 
I cannot enter into all these didactical 
considerations. I shall only touch upon 
one of them, the question of the concen- 
tration of the whole school instruction. 
In principle, this question is answered by 
the demand that the school shall be the 
place of preparation for the future voca- 
tion of the pupil. This may of course 
mean very little in the elementary schools 
of a city, where the pupils of one and the 
same class will gravitate to the most 
various kinds of manual work, which 
cannot from the beginning be predicted. 
It may on the other hand mean a great 
deal in a small rural community where 
boys and girls are destined to follow some 
agricultural work. Every one knows that 
concentration is a prerequisite for suc- 
cess. That does not apply to that super- 
ficial concentration of many of our school 
schedules, but rather to the inner con-
-P-A-G-E-95
  Summary and Conclusion 83 
centration which during one and the 
same lesson directs its activity to as 
few things as possible. It is a distortion 
of the idea of concentration, however, to 
give up the separate subjects of instruc- 
tion and to try to mass the whole material 
together into a purely arbitrarily arranged 
system. All human knowledge has in 
the course of time divided itself up into 
independent but well-connected depart- 
ments arising from the organization of 
our psychical functions. If we keep to 
the arrangement that is inherent in the 
knowledge itself, we will get out of it 
whatever educative power it possesses, 
and only in that way will it help to 
develop the clearness of judgment so 
necessary for the formation of character. 
It is only the man who has no idea of 
the educative power that lies in a well- 
rounded, closed system of knowledge,

  84 Idea of the Industrial School 
in its place for the purposes of his curric- 
ulum the heap of broken glass, through 
which only a diffuse and dim, uncertain 
light can shine. Even in the special 
industrial subjects the method and course 
of instruction must be determined by 
the nature of the subject itself. It is 
senseless to interrupt in its systematic 
development the regular course of a sub- 
ject undertaken to train the will and give 
practice in elementary mechanical pro- 
cesses of work merely for the purpose of 
arranging some so-called concentration 
with the other subjects of instruction. 
Concentration must never disturb the 
peaceful development of capacities that 
will later become necessary. This of 
course does not by any means exclude 
manual activity in other subjects. A 
systematic course in drawing must go on 
in the way mapped out for it according 
to psychological laws without paying 
any attention to other subjects. At the 
same time, however, drawing ought to

  Summary and Conclusion 85 
be used as a means of expression in all 
other subjects from the very beginning. 
This shows in general outline the or- 
ganization of our future school. I do 
not think we need feel in helping with all 
our might to pave the way for the de- 
velopment of such a school that we are 
in any sense of the word revolutionists. 
I feel that we are rather helping to vic- 
tory old, very old, pedagogical demands, 
by striving in our public schools to exert 
some influence upon that great mass of 
people, for whom exclusively intellectual 
work can never be the sole means of edu- 
cation. Above all, I have the feeling that 
in our endeavour we are working in the 
spirit of the man whom we have praised so 
much and understood so little, who told 
us so often in “Leonhard and Gertrude,” 
in his letters to Heinrich Gessner and in 
his last book, that only work in the child’s 
environment gives the elementary school 
its educational power. I venture further 
to say, even although we find it nowhere
-P-A-G-E-98
86 Idea of the Industrial School 
expressly stated in his works, that Pes- 
talozzi was of the firm conviction that 
vocational education was the gateway to 
the real education of mankind. 
Three generations have passed away 
since his death. His work still awaits 
completion. In a speech on January 12, 
1818 to his house, he said: “I believe I 
am right in saying that the century which 
saw at its beginning the start of our 
educational activities will see at its end 
the uninterrupted continuation of our 
work in the hands of men who will give 
thanks to the united efforts of our house 
for their opinions and for their educational 
methods.” The sands of thoughtlessness 
have piled up mountains over the truths 
that once filled and stirred the heart of 
that tireless worker for the education of 
mankind. But real truths like spirits 
rise up again and again from out their 
graves and wander up and down and dis- 
turb the heart of man, until they ulti- 
mately find peace and salvation in their

realization in real life. All those of us 
who work with true earnestness and un- 
flagging energy to pave the way for the 
school of the future, who keep always in 
mind “the father of the elementary 
school,” are helping to bring the desired 
salvation to these spirits. Let us hope 
that the end of the twentieth century 
will see perfected and will be able to 
enjoy what he in desperate struggles and 
in dire necessity started to fight for at the 
beginning of the nineteenth.

  APPENDIX 
An Example of Industrial Training in 
the Elementary Schools of Munich 
NDUSTRIAL training in the spirit 
described in the text has been or- 
ganized in Munich in all the continuation 
schools and in the highest classes of the 
elementary schools. The state board of 
education agreed to the carrying out of 
the plan in all the classes, but the local 
board has up till now refused to grant 
the relatively small amount of money 
required for this purpose. Last year 
they agreed to give a small amount for 
the organization of a series of four trial 
classes. The refusal to grant money for 
a complete organization of this scheme, 
as was carried out in the continuation 
schools, can be explained partly by un- 
warranted fear of the expense, and partly 
89
-P-A-G-E-102
go Appendix 
by warranted anxiety to keep up the 
standards of the present-day “book” 
school. This anxiety was perhaps oc- 
casioned by the numerous distorted ideas 
and propositions, which the literature on 
industrial training can show, and also 
by the absolutely false ideas of the es- 
sence of industrial training which have 
been common in the whole of Germany 
during the last four years. This refusal 
on the part of the authorities I do not 
consider as a misfortune, so long as the 
trial classes are earnestly and sincerely 
supported. For the spirit of the indus- 
trial school demands an essentially dif- 
ferent type of normal school training 
from the one in vogue at present. As 
long as the instructors themselves are 
educated in “book” schools, there can 
only be a few who will be able by means 
of their own force of character to enter 
into the spirit of the industrial school. 
But if the normal schools are once filled 
with this spirit, it will be transferred
-P-A-G-E-103
    Appendix gI 
to the elementary schools without op- 
position. The expenses incidental to 
this kind of school are not so great as to 
prove any real hindrance to it. This 
has been proved in the organization of 
the two trial classes which are now held 
in Munich, and which I shall now briefly 
describe. 
If the industrial school really denotes 
an essential advance, if the carrying out of 
the principle is to increase the active 
interest of the pupil in all subjects of 
instruction, then we must of necessity 
achieve in our industrial school, with less 
time devoted to formal instruction, as 
much as has been achieved in our present- 
day school, which devotes much more 
time to formal lessons and very little 
to active work on the part of the pupil. 
Accordingly the time for formal instruc- 
tion in the first and second grades was 
in the two experimental classes shortened 
to four or five hours. Again, it was 
necessary to divide the classes, which con- 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
  92 Appendix 
tained forty-four and fifty children re- 
spectively, into two divisions for a great 
many of the lessons, so that each division 
could be taught independently. For the 
actual working up of new ideas and the 
manual activity necessary in many sub- 
jects of instruction could only be success- 
fully carried out with small classes. An 
absolute division of each class, 7.e. the 
setting up of a rule that no class contain 
more than twenty-two or twenty-five 
children, is by no means necessary. If 
it were so, no board of education at the 
present time could seriously consider the 
introduction of the industrial school. It 
is useless to point to the small classes in 
Sweden or Denmark or in some parts of 
the United States. The relatively small 
salary offered to teachers in those lands 
makes the introduction of small classes 
much easier than is the case in the large 
cities of Germany with their relatively 
high salaries. Now acompetent salary for 
the teacher, making his position secure and
-P-A-G-E-105
Appendix 93 
giving him joy in his work, is much more 
important for the spirit of the industrial 
school than the adoption of a very small 
maximum number of pupils per class. 
The adoption of this latter rule would 
at once double the common school ex- 
penses of a city like Munich. Such a 
small maximum is also by no means 
necessary for the establishment of the 
industrial school. For this school has 
not only to introduce the child to the 
world of knowledge but also to control 
the practice of the knowledge and 
accomplishments. Now in practising 
something the number of pupils working 
together is not of the greatest importance. 
Even in introducing them to new knowl- 
edge there are certain subjects of in- 
struction where at the same time forty 
or fifty pupils can be handled, I mean 
in such traditional subjects which will 
always have to be taught by means of 
words and books, and where the book 
and the thinking over its content will
-P-A-G-E-106
94 Appendix 
form the whole intellectual work. To 
this group belong history, religion, cer- 
tain parts of language instruction and 
certain parts of geography. 
The division of the classes was made 
for two periods of object lesson work, 
two periods of arithmetic and two of 
writing, so that while the pupils had 
roughly seventeen periods, the teaching 
was spread over twenty-three periods. 
The two divisions were called A and B. 
Division A came to-school at 9 a.m. and 
division B at 10 a.m. From 10 to 11.30 
both divisions worked together. At 11.30 
A was dismissed, while B remained until 
12.30, receiving that instruction which had 
been given to A from 9 to 10 a.m. In 
the afternoons of Monday and Thursday 
there was one hour school for each divi- 
sion: A from 2 to 3 p.M.; B from 2.40 
to 3.40 P.M. 
A copy of the weekly schedule is printed 
on page 96. The following points are 
to be noted: The length of each period
-P-A-G-E-107
  Appendix 95 
is put after the subject in brackets. 
Pauses between lessons are not shown. 
The subjects of instruction in heavy type 
are those given to A and B together. 
Division B has of course the same sub- 
jects of instruction from 11.30 to 12.30 
as A has from 9 to 10. In other words, 
division A had school from 9 to 11.30 
and B from Io to 12.30 every morning; 
besides this, on Mondays, and Thursdays, 
A had school from 2 to 3 p.m. and B from 
2.40 to 3.40 P.M. Only on Wednesdays 
and Saturdays were the two divisions 
taught together from 9 to 11.30 A.M. 
Besides this A had from 11.30 to 12 on 
Wednesdays and B from 11.30 to 12 on 
Saturdays. On four afternoons in the 
week there was no school. 
The content of each subject of instruc- 
tion required to follow the schedule au- 
thorized by the minister of education 
for all the common schools in Munich. 
This proved no hindrance for the carry- 
ing out of the idea of the industrial

a      
-P-A-G-E-109
  Appendix 97 
school. The only difference in these 
trial classes was the provision for real 
work in connection with the object lesson. 
I will give here a brief summary of the 
work of the first grade in each subject. 
The second grade was only organized 
at the beginning of the school year 
IQII-1912. 
a. Object lessons including drawing and 
manual work. 
This endeavoured to make the personal 
experiences of the child the starting-point 
and the centre for his activity. Accord- 
ing to the Munich schedule it was the 
business of the object lesson by means of 
sharpening and practising the senses to 
awaken and encourage thoughtful ob- 
servation, to explain ideas already pos- 
sessed, to increase the store of ideas, to 
arrange them and to form new and funda- 
mental ideas and concepts. The personal 
experiences, that were made the basis of 
our object lessons, were taken partly 
out of the practical life of the school 
H
-P-A-G-E-110
  98 Appendix 
and partly from the home life of the 
children. 
At the beginning of the school year 
actual manual work was preceded by 
exercises for the sharpening of the senses. 
These exercises were taken partly from 
Montessori’s book, “Il Metodo della 
Pedagogia Scientifica,” and were carried 
out generally in the nature of a game. 
Of course during the whole year they 
were never entirely neglected and were 
arranged at certain times in connection 
with certain activities. They covered 
the recognition of colors and forms, of 
tones according to their pitch and inten- 
sity, the judgment of the weight of dif- 
ferent materials, the acquisition of tact- 
ual ideas of the most varying materials 
and lastly the control of movements and 
the localization of sensations of move- 
ment. A great number of materials 
served this purpose. The work, which 
was brought into the closest connection 
with the object lessons, included sewing, 
 
-P-A-G-E-111
  Appendix 99 
knitting, basket weaving, woodwork, 
gardening and the so-called household 
work. Boys and girls were instructed in 
the same work, so that the boys learned 
sewing and knitting and the girls wood- 
work. Other hand work was occasion- 
ally used, e.g. modelling in clay, folding 
paper for special purposes, cardboard 
work and weaving on hand looms. No 
special attention, however, was paid to 
these latter, so as not to make the num- 
ber of occupations too numerous. A 
thorough training in some few activities 
was deemed more desirable. The activi- 
ties we concentrated upon were chosen 
because they approximated more closely 
to the family life of the child. As soon 
as it was possible, the children were or- 
ganized from the standpoint of an in- 
dustrial community, i.e. from the stand- 
point of service and help among the 
children themselves and with the idea 
of working together for a common aim or 
purpose. The method of carrying this  
-P-A-G-E-112
  100 Appendix 
out was of course different from that 
of the kindergarten. In the elementary 
school it can never be the chief purpose 
merely to keep the children busy in a 
sensible manner. We must aim at sys- 
tematically increasing manual dexterity 
in order to train the will to more and more 
careful work and thereby gradually 
change the instinct of play into one of 
work. Certain definite departments of 
work must always be favoured in the 
schedule, however varying the method of 
activity may be according to the dis- 
position of the teacher and child or ac- 
cording to the capacities of the children, 
or the materials at disposal. Again, even 
within certain departments of work it is 
wise to restrict the number of manual 
activities to a few, so that during the 
first school year they may be able to 
reach some degree of exactness. We can 
also in a way test whether the few chosen 
departments of work correspond to the 
physical and mental needs of the child. 
 
-P-A-G-E-113
  Appendix 101 
This can be done by watching whether 
the majority of the children, when outside 
the influence of the school and merely in 
accordance with their instinct of imita- 
tion, seek out and make use of similar 
activities in their work at home and in 
their play. 
The manner in which manual activity 
was brought into connection with the con- 
ventional themes of the object lesson can 
be seen from the following summary :— 
First Lesson. The Gymnasium and 
the Playground. The making of wooden 
rods with pointed ends, of ladders and of 
handles for apparatus, and other similar 
things. 
Second Lesson. The Street. Con- 
struction of wooden blocks, a wooden 
cupboard, a simple wagon made out of 
bobbins and small pieces of board. 
Third Lesson. The Garden in Autumn. 
The construction of wooden supports for 
flowers or bushes. The sewing of seed 
bags made of gauze.
-P-A-G-E-114
    102 Appendix 
Fourth Lesson. Christmas. The 
making of a small bag for presents or of 
a present such as a bag for serviettes. 
The construction of wooden building 
blocks — rectangular and triangular col- 
umns. 
Fifth Lesson. Snow and Ice. The 
construction of a wooden sleigh and the 
weaving of a seat out of basket work. 
Sixth Lesson. At the Dressmaker’s. 
The construction of a wooden metre 
stick and a T-square. The preparation 
of models for dolls’ dresses and the sew- 
ing of the same according to the models. 
Seventh Lesson. Easter. The colour- 
ing of Easter eggs. 
Eighth Lesson. The School Garden 
in Spring. The construction of flower 
boxes and a wooden trellis fence for same. 
The sowing of seeds and the planting of 
flowers. The weaving of a flower bas- 
ket and a fruit basket. 
Ninth Lesson. The Fruit Market. 
The modelling of various fruits.
-P-A-G-E-115
  Appendix 103 
Besides these activities, household work 
was also practised. This included keep- 
ing the school-room and workshop clean 
and tidy, brushing, dusting, washing 
and decorating, and lastly in helping to 
preparé Christmas bakery and Easter 
eggs. The gardening was restricted in 
autumn, because of very unfavourable 
weather, to the gathering of seeds, to the 
planting of flowers and bulbs in pots and 
also in the garden where they had to be 
protected from the frost by covering 
them with earth. The pots were taken 
out of the ground in spring and the 
flowers proved for weeks the most beauti- 
ful decoration of the school-room. In 
summer, besides attending to their own 
flowers, the children worked in the garden 
of the eighth grade under the supervision 
of the girls of this grade. The teacher 
was very well pleased with the results 
of this association of the smaller children 
with the older girls. Both old and young 
in this industrial community showed
-P-A-G-E-116
  104 Appendix 
equal enthusiasm and equal pleasure, 
and the educative value for the eighth- 
grade girls was undoubtedly great. 
b. Arithmetic. 
Care was taken here that every child 
should have actual objects so that he 
could work independently with these. 
Of course from the very beginning stress 
was laid upon the fact that the child 
should not merely guess at results but 
should take the greatest pains in counting 
or measuring exactly, and by these means 
develop his simple number concepts. 
To carry through the principle of indus- 
trial training in arithmetic we made use 
of cardboard discs, buttons, little sticks, 
bobbins, strings of beads, copper and 
nickel coins in purses made by the chil- 
dren themselves, and so on. Of course 
all the manual activity in woodwork 
with its perpetual judging, measuring and 
comparing was of immense value. 
c. Writing — Reading. 
As preparation for writing we followed
-P-A-G-E-117
  Appendix 105 
Montessori in using geometrical forms. 
The children practised drawing their 
pencil round these forms. The resulting 
form had then to be carefully coloured. 
By these means the children got the habit 
of observing carefully these outlines and 
of paying attention to the exact copying 
of the form and trying to draw it cor- 
rectly. Thus they slowly mastered the 
writing movements of the hand and the 
work was not complicated by making them 
learn the more difficult letter forms. 
After this the letter cases made by Super- 
intendent Schmid were freely used for 
the self-activity of the children. The 
teaching of the particular letter was 
carried out in some such manner as this : 
The letter to be learned was slowly 
written on the blackboard, the children 
paying attention to every movement. 
They had then to find the letter in the 
letter case, and copy it as big as possible 
upon unruled paper. They were told to 
touch it and to run their fingers round
-P-A-G-E-118
  106 Appendix 
it until it was perfectly familiar to them. 
The preliminary exercises were followed 
by writing the letters upon the large 
blackboards that covered three sides of 
the school-room. Each child was al- 
lowed a certain amount of blackboard 
space. This work was then corrected, 
all the children trying to find mistakes. 
Only after this was each child allowed to 
work independently in his notebook or 
on his slate. Hand in hand with these 
exercises went reading and _ spelling. 
These latter were usually taught in this 
fashion: New sentences were written in 
printed characters upon one of the black- 
boards by the teacher. The children 
translated these printed characters into 
written characters with the help of the 
letter case. Then they wrote the sen- 
tence by heart into their notebooks. 
The reading primer was read through and 
thoroughly understood by the middle of 
May, so that for the last two months of 
the school year the children were given
-P-A-G-E-119
  Appendix 107 
a first reading-book which they used with 
greatenjoyment. At first they had some 
difficulty with the stories printed in 
fairly small type. 
d. Catholic Religious Instruction. 
The religious instruction had to con- 
form to the official schedule for the first 
grade. The principle of  self-activity 
within these limits was carried out as 
far as possible. In the object lessons 
pertaining to liturgy this was possible 
in the real sense of the term. Liturgical 
objects and actions were seen and studied 
during repeated visits to St. Joseph’s 
Church. Various objects, such as an 
altar, manger, cross, flag, sepulchre, etc. 
were drawn by the children. The litur- 
gical actions were imitated partly in 
play and partly in all seriousness, ¢.g 
the adoration of the Infant Christ, the 
stations of the cross, the mass, etc. Re- 
ligious-ethical instruction was combined 
with all the experiences of the child (at 
home, on the streets, in the school and  
-P-A-G-E-120
108 Appendix 
on the playground). In regard to the 
teaching of prayers, stress was laid upon 
real prayer andnot upon mere memorizing. 
The teaching of the Bible stories was 
made realistic by dramatizing them as 
much as possible and assigning parts 
among the children. 
e. Gymnastics. 
Twenty minutes were devoted to this 
every day. ‘Twice this fell in the after- 
noon, on Monday and Thursday; on 
all the other days it was in the forenoon. 
The forenoon exercises proved a welcome 
interruption and prevented the possibility 
of mental fatigue. In the afternoons 
such exercises were practised as would 
develop the will power of the children, 
t.e. exercises for the correct holding of 
the body, competitive games and races. 
In the forenoons running, singing and 
imitation games were generally played. 
Many of the imitation games were made 
up by the children themselves and often 
stood in some kind of a connection with
-P-A-G-E-121
    Appendix 109 
their lessons. I give the children’s names 
for some of these games: ‘‘My flowers 
are thirsty,” ‘Street traffic,” “‘Keep to 
the right,” “War,” etc. 
f. Singing. 
The songs were chosen in connection 
with the subject treated of in the object 
lessons. To give a clear understanding 
of rhythm, the children had to find 
out the time of the songs by hearing 
the teacher sing them. 
The above sketch is merely an example 
of one way of organizing. Other school 
conditions would lead to other ways of 
organization. All ways are good so long 
as we keep to the principles laid down 
in the text. And yet principles and 
methods mean little if the teacher is 
not filled with the spirit of the indus- 
trial school. He must have been ac- 
customed to work up and use his own 
intellectual material; he must be able 
to overcome his own lazy nature and
-P-A-G-E-122
  110 Appendix 
must press forward with inexhaustible 
persistence filled with the love of knowl- 
edge; he must also have a deep insight 
into the workings of the child’s mind — 
an insight which our normal school 
psychology unfortunately cannot give us. 
If he has not these things, then the idea 
of the industrial school will remain for 
him an eternal riddle.

Cloth, 8v0, xvii+295 pages, $1.50 net 
A connected series of discussions on the foundations of education in 
the related sciences of biology, physiology, sociology, and philosophy, and 
a thoroughgoing interpretation of nature, place, and meaning of education 
in our world. The newest points of view in the realm of natural and 
mental science are applied to the understanding of educational problems. 
The field of education is carefully divided, and the total discussion is de- 
voted to the philosophy of education, in distinction from its history, 
science, and art. 
The Psychological Principles of Education 
By HERMAN HARRELL HORNE, Pu.D. 
Cloth, r2mo, xiii+435 pages, $1.75 net 
The relationship of this book to the author’s “ Philosophy of Educa- 
tion” is that, whereas the first was mostly theory with some practice, this 
is mostly practice with some theory. This volume lays the scientific 
foundations for the art of teaching so far as those foundations are con- 
cerned with psychology. The author is the “middleman” between the 
psychologist and the teacher, taking the theoretical descriptions of pure 
psychology and transforming them into educational principles for the 
teacher. In the Introduction the reader gets his bearings in the field of 
the science of education. The remainder of the book sketches this science 
from the standpoint of psychology, the four parts of the work, Intellectual 
Education, Emotional Education, Moral Education, and Religious Educa- 
tion, being suggested by the nature of man, the subject of education. A 
special feature is the attention paid to the education of the emotions and 
of the will.

This book is a direct outcome of experience in trying to help 
teachers grow in skill in the art of teaching and in power to appreci- 
ate the work in which they are engaged. The problems that the 
teachers face day after day in the classroom are treated as concretely 
as possible. Theories of education have not been discussed at any 
great length, but rather those processes through which these funda- 
mental principles find their expression in actual teaching. 
Each of the several typical methods of instruction has been treated, 
and the validity of the particular practice indicated in terms of the 
end to be accomplished, as well as the technique to be used. Since 
the technique of the teaching method is not the only element in de- 
termining the efficiency of the teacher, there is included a discussion 
of those other aspects of the teacher’s work which determine the 
contribution that is made by the teacher to the education of children.

The Posture of School Children 
With its Home Efficiency and New Efficiency 
Methods for School Training 
The aim of the book is to aid parents and teachers to improve the 
posture of children. The failure to achieve and hold the correct position 
in childhood is the cause of far-reaching harm, Many disturbances, both 
acute and chronic, are directly traceable to poor posture and carriage. 
The application of pedagogical principles to the training of children in 
correct habits of posture and a working description of some of the new 
efficiency methods practiced in schools for the purpose of obtaining correct 
posture are authoritatively presented and applied,

Decorated cloth, gilt top, $1.50 net 
These games have been collected from many countries and sources, 
with a view to securing novel and interesting as well as thoroughly tried 
and popular material. They range from the traditional to the modern 
gymnasium and athletic games, 
The material, aside from that accumulated through long experience 
in teaching and supervision, has been collected through special original 
research, which has resulted not only in a variety of new plays but in new 
ways of playing old games that add greatly to their play value.

  The need of such work is evidenced: by the great mass of varied 
educational literature showing an equal range in educational practice and 
theory; by the growing importance of the school as a social institution, 
and the fuller recognition of education as a social process; and by the 
great increase in the number of teachers and the instability of tenure 
which at the same time marks the profession. 
The men who need it are: all teachers, professional men, editors, 
ministers, legislators, all public men who deal with large questions of 
public welfare intimately connected with education — every one who ap- 
preciates the value of a reference work which will give him the outlines 
of any educational problem, the suggested solutions, the statistical infor- 
mation, and in general the essential facts necessary to its comprehension. 
Among the departmental Editors associated with Dr. Monroe are Dr. 
Elmer E. Brown, President New York University; Prof. E. F. Buchner, 
of Johns Hopkins; Dr. Wm. H. Burnham, Clark University; M. Gabriel

  PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION 
“THe education of the child must accord both in mode 
and arrangement with the education of mankind as consid- 
ered historically ; or, in other words, the genesis of knowledge 
in the individual must follow the same course as the genesis 
of knowledge in the race. To M. Comte we believe society 
owes the enunciation of this doctrine—a doctrine which we 
may accept without committing ourselves to his theory of 
the genesis of knowledge, either in its causes or its order.”?! 
If this principle, held also by Pestalozzi and Froebel, be 
correct, then it would seem as if the knowledge of the 
history of a science must be an effectual aid in teaching 
that science. Be this doctrine true or false, certainly the 
experience of many instructors establishes the importance 
of mathematical history in teaching? With the hope of 
being of some assistance to my fellow-teachers, I have pre- 
pared this book and have interlined my narrative with 
occasional remarks and suggestions on methods of teaching. 
No doubt, the thoughtful reader will draw many useful

  A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
ANTIQUITY 
  NUMBER-SYSTEMS AND NUMERALS & 
Neaxrzy all number-systems, both ancient and modern, are 
based on the scale of 5, 10, or 20. The reason for this it is 
not difficult to see.. When a child learns to count, he makes 
use of his fingers and perhaps of his toes. In the same way 
the savages of prehistoric times unquestionably counted on 
their fingers and in some cases also on their toes. Such is 
indeed the practice of the African, the Eskimo, and the South 
Sea Islander of to-day.1 This recourse to the fingers has 
often resulted in the development of a more or less extended 
pantomime number-system, in which the fingers were used as 
in a deaf and dumb alphabet. Evidence of the prevalence of 
finger symbolisms is found among the ancient Egyptians, 
Babylonians, Greeks, and Romans, as also among the Euro- 
peans of the middle ages: even now nearly all Eastern nations 
use finger symbolisms. The Chinese express on the left hand

“all numbers less than 100,000; the thumb nail of the right 
hand touches each joint of the little finger, passing first up 
the external side, then down the middle, and afterwards up 
the other side of it, in order to express the nine digits; the 
tens are denoted in the same way, on the second finger; the 
hundreds on the third; the thousands on the fourth; and ten- 
thousands on the thumb. It would be merely necessary to 
proceed to the right hand in order to be able to extend this 
”1 So common is the use of this finger- 
symbolism that traders are said to communicate to one another 
the price at which they are willing to buy or sell by touching 
hands, the act being concealed by their cloaks from observa- 
tion of by-standers. system of numeration. 
Had the number of fingers and toes been different in man, 
then the prevalent number-systems of the world would hi 
been different also. We are safe in saying that had one 
finger sprouted from each human hand, making twelve fi S 
in all, then the numerical scale adopted by civilized nagins 
would not be the decimal, but the duodecimal. Two re 
symbols would be necessary to represent 10 and 11, resjpc- 
tively. As far as arithmetic is concerned, it is certainly to be 
regretted that a sixth finger did not appear. Except for the 
necessity of using two more signs or numerals and of being 
obliged to learn the multiplication table as far as 12 x 12, the 
duodecimal system is decidedly superior to the decimal. The 
number twelve has for its exact divisors 2, 3, 4, 6, while ten has 
only 2and 5. In ordinary business affairs, the fractions \4, 4, 4, 
are used extensively, and it is very convenient to have a base 
which is an exact multiple of 2,3, and 4. Among the most 
zealous advocates of the duodecimal scale was Charles XII.

of Sweden, who, at the time of his death, was contemplating 
the change for his dominions from the decimal to the duo- 
decimal.’ But it is not likely that the change will ever be 
brought about. So deeply rooted is the decimal system that 
when the storm of the French Revolution swept out of exist- 
ence other old institutions, the decimal system not only 
remained unshaken, but was more firmly established than 
ever. The advantages of twelve as a base were not recognized. 
until arithmetic was so far developed as to make a change 
impossible. “The case is the not uncommon one of high 
civilization bearing evident traces of the rudeness of its origin 
in ancient barbaric life.” ? 
Of the notations based on human anatomy, the_quinary and 
vigesimal systems are frequent among the. lower races, while 
the higher nations have usually avoided the one as too scanty 
and the other as too cumbrous, preferring the intermediate 
decimal system. Peoples have not always consistently 
adhered to any one scale. In the quinary system, 5, 25, 125, 
625, ete., should be the values of the successive higher units, 
but a quinary system thus carried out was never in actual use: 
whenever it was extended to higher numbers it invariably ran 
either into the decimal or into the vigesimal system. “The 
home par excellence of the quinary, or rather of the quinary- 
vigesimal scale, is America. It is practically universal among 
the Eskimo tribes of the Arctic regions. It prevailed among 
a considerable portion of the North American Indian tribes, 
and was almost universal with the native races of Central and

2. B. Trtor, Primitive Culture, New York, 1889, Vol. I., p.272. In 
some respects a scale having for its base a power of 2—the base 8 or 16, 
for instance, —is superior to the duodecimal, but it has the disadvantage 
of not being divisible by 3. See W. W. Jounson, ‘‘Octonary Numera- 
tion,’ Bull. N. Y. Math. Soc., 1891, Vol. I., pp. 1-6.

South America.”! This system was used also by many of the 
North Siberian and African tribes. Traces of it are found in 
the languages of peoples who now use the decimal scale; for 
example, in Homeric Greek. The Roman notation reveals 
traces of it; viz., I, II,--. V, VI,---X, XI, --- XV, ete. 
It is curious that the quinary should so frequently merge 
into the vigesimal scale; that savages should have passed from 
the number of fingers on one hand as an upper unit or a stop- 
ping-place, to the total number of fingers and toes as an upper 
unit or resting-point. The vigesimal system is less common 
than the quinary, but, like it, is never found entirely pure. In 
this the first four units are 20, 400, 8000, 160,000, and special 
words for these numbers are actually found among the Mayas 
of Yucatan. The transition from quinary to vigesimal is 
shown in the Aztec system, which may be represented thus, 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 541, --- 10,10 +1, --- 104+ 5,10 +5 +1, --- 20, 
20 +1, --- 20410, 204+10+41, --- 40, ete? Special words 
occur here for the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, 40, ete. The 
vigesimal system flourished in America, but was rare in the 
Old World. Celtic remnants of one occur in the French words 
quatre-vingts (4 x 20 or 80), sia-vingts (6 x 20 or 120), quinze- 
vingts (15 x 20 or 300). Note also the English word score in 
such expressions ‘as three-score years and ten. 
Of the three systems based on human anatomy, the decimal 
system is the most prevalent, so prevalent, in fact, that accord- 
ing to ancient tradition it was.used by all the races of the 
world. It is only within the last few centuries that the other

two systems have been found in use among previously unknown 
tribes. The decimal scale was used in North America by 
the greater number of Indian tribes, but in South America it 
‘was rare. 
In the construction of the decimal system, 10 was suggested. 
by the number of fingers as the first stopping-place in count- 
ing, and as the first higher unit. Any number between 10 
and 100 was pronounced according to the plan b(10) + a(1), 
a and b being integers less than 10. But the number 110 
might be expressed in two ways, (1) as 10 x 10 + 10, (2) as 
11x10. The latter method would not seem unnatural. 
Why not imitate eighty, ninety, and say eleventy, instead of 
hundred and ten ? But upon this choice between 10 x 10 + 10 
and 11 x 10 hinges the systematic construction of the number 
system.’ Good luck led all nations which developed the 
decimal system to the choice of the former;* the unit 10 
being here treated in a manner similar to the treatment of the 
lower unit 1 in expressing numbers below 100. Any num- 
ber between 100 and 1000 was designated c(10)? + b(10)+ a, 
a, b, c representing integers less than 10. Similarly for num- 
bers below 10,000, d(10)* + ¢(10)? + (10)! + a(10)°; and simi- 
larly for still higher numbers. 
Proceeding to describe the notations of numbers, we 
begin with the Babylonian. Cuneiform writing, as also the 
accompanying notation of numbers, was probably invented

by the early Sumerians. A vertical wedge Y stood for 
one, while < and ¥> signified 10 and 100, respectively. 
In case of numbers below 100, the values of the separate sym- 
bols were added. Thus, S¥w for 23, ¢ << for 30. The 
signs of higher value are written on the left of those of lower 
value. But in writing the hundreds a smaller symbol was 
placed before that for 100 and was multiplied into 100. Thus, 
J < Y = signified 10 x 100 or 1000. Taking this for a new 
unit, < < Y = was interpreted, not as 20 x 100, but as 
10 x 1000. In this notation no numbers have been found as 
large as a million. The principles applied in this notation 
are the additive and the multiplicative. Besides this the 
Babylonians had another, the sexagesimal notation, to be 
noticed later. oe 
An insight into Egyptian methods of notation was obtained 
through the deciphering of the hieroglyphics by Champollion, 
Young, and others. The numerals are l (@), NM (10), @ (100), 
& 4000), { (20,000), Ss (400,000), $8 (4,000,000), O_ 
(10,000,000). The sign for one represents a vertical staff; 
that for 10,000, a pointing finger; that for 100,000, a burbot; 
that for 1,000,000, a man in astonishment. No certainty has 
been reached regarding the significance of the other symbols. 
These numerals like the other hieroglyphic signs were plainly 
pictures of animals or objects familiar to the Egyptians, 
which in some way suggested the idea to be conveyed. They 
are excellent examples of picture-writing. The principle in- 
volved in the Egyptian notation was the additive throughout. 
Thus, ce fi] would be 111.

zum Kulturleben der Volker, Halle, 1868, pp. 22-38.

Hieroglyphics are found on monuments, obelisks, and walls 
of temples. Besides these the Egyptians had hieratic and 
demotic writings, both supposed to be degenerated forms of 
hieroglyphics, such as would be likely to evolve through pro- 
longed use and attempts at rapid writing. The following are 
hieratic signs :?

Since there are more hieratic symbols than hieroglyphic, 
numbers could be written more concisely in the former. The 
additive principle rules in both, and the symbols for larger 
values always precede those for smaller values. 
About the time of Solon, the Greeks used ‘the thitial letters 
of the numeral adjectives to represent numbers. These signs 
are often called Herodianic signs (after Herodianus, a Byzan- 
tine grammarian of about 200 a.p., who describes them). 
They are also called Altic, because they occur frequently in 
Athenian inscriptions. The Phcenicians, Syrians, and Hebrews 
possessed at this time alphabets and the two latter used letters 
of the alphabet to designate numbers. The Greeks began to 
adopt the same course about 500 B.c. The letters of the Greek 
alphabet, together with three antique letters, -, 9, ®, and the

symbol M, were used for numbers. For the numbers 1-9 they 
wrote a, B, y, 5, ¢,s, & 7, 9; for the tens 10-90, 1, x, A, pw, vy, 
o, 7, 9, for the hundreds 100-900, p, o, 7, v, $, x, ¥, o, 7; for 
the thousands they wrote ,a, ,B, ,y, ,8, ,¢ etc.; for 10,000, M; 
for 20,000, M; for 30,000, M, etc. The change from Attic to 
alphabetic numerals was decidedly for the worse, as the 
former were less burdensome to the memory. In Greek gram- 
mars we often find it stated that alphabetic numerals were 
marked with an accent to distinguish them from words, but 
this was not commonly the case; a horizontal line drawn over 
the number usually answered this purpose, while the accent 
generally indicated a unit-fraction, thus 8’=}.' The Greeks 
applied to their numerals the additive and, in cases like M 
for 50,000, also the multiplicative principle. 
In the Roman notation we have, besides the additive, the 
principle of subtraction. If a letter is placed before another 
of greater value, the former is to be subtracted from the latter. 
Thus, IV = 4, while VI=6. Though this principle has not 
been found in any other notation, it sometimes occurs in numer- 
ation. Thus in Latin duodeviginti = 2 from 20, or 18.2. The 
Roman numerals are supposed to be of Etruscan origin. 
Thus, in the Babylonian, Egyptian, Greek, Roman, and 
other decimal notations of antiquity, numbers are expressed 
by means of a few signs, these symbols being combined by 
addition alone, or by addition together with multiplication 
or subtraction. But in none of these decimal systems do we 
find the all-important principle of position or principle of

local value, such as we have in the notation now in use. 
Having missed this principle, the ancients had no use for a 
symbol to represent zero, and were indeed very far removed 
from an ideal notation. In this matter even the Greeks and 
Romans failed to achieve what a remote nation in Asia, little 
known to Europeans before the present century, accomplished 
most admirably. But before we speak of the Hindus, we 
must speak of an ancient Babylonian notation, which, strange 
to say, is not based on the scale 5, 10, or 20, and which, 
moreover, came very near a full embodiment of the ideal 
principle found wanting in other ancient systems. We refer 
to the sewagesimal notation. 
The Babylonians used this chiefly in the construction of 
weights and measures. The systematic development of the 
sexagesimal scale, both for integers and fractions, reveals a 
high degree of mathematical insight on the part of the early 
Sumerians. The notation has been found on two Babylonian 
tablets. One of them, probably dating from 1600 or 2300 .c., 
contains a list of square numbers up to 60% The first seven 
are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36,49. We have next 1.4= 8’, 1.21 =9% 
1.40 = 10°, 2.1=11’, etc. This remains unintelligible, unless 
we assume the scale of sixty, which makes 14=60+4, 
1.21 = 60 + 21, ete. The second tablet records the magnitude 
of the illuminated portion of the moon’s disc for every day 
from new to full moon, the whole dise being assumed to con- 
sist of 240 parts. The illuminated parts during the first five 
days are the series 5, 10, 20, 40, 1.20(= 80). This reveals 
again the sexagesimal scale and also some knowledge of 
geometrical progressions. From here on the series becomes an 
arithmetical progression, the numbers from the fifth to the 
fifteenth day being respectively, 1.20, 1.36, 1.52, 2.8, 2.24, 2.40, 
2.56, 3.12, 3.28, 3.44, 4. In this sexagesimal notation we have, 
then, the principle of local value. Thus, in 1.4(= 64), the 1 is
-P-A-G-E-18

made to stand for 60, the unit of the second order, by virtue of 
its position with respect to the 4. In Babylonia some use was 
thus made of the principle of position, perhaps 2000 years 
before the Hindus developed it. This was at a time when 
Romulus and Remus, yea even Achilles, Menelaus, and Helen, 
were still unknown to history and song. But the full develop- 
ment of the principle of position calls for a symbol to represent 
the absence of quantity, or zero. Babylonian records of about 
200 8.c. give a symbol for zero which denoted the absence of a 
figure, but apparently was not used in calculation. It con- 
sisted of two marks 3. About 130 a.p. Ptolemy in his Al 
magest used sexagesimal fractions, and also the omicron o to 
represent blanks in the sexagesimal numbers. This o was not 
used as a regular zero. Hence, the Babylonians had the prin- 
ciple of local value, and also a symbol for zero to indicate the 
absence of a figure, but did not use this zero in computation. 
Their sexagesimal fractions were transmitted to India. 
What was it that suggested to the Babylonians the number 
sixty as a base? Cantor’ and others offer the following 
provisional reply: At first the Babylonians reckoned the year 
at 360 days. his led to the division of the circumference of 
a circle into 360 degrees, each degree representing the daily 
part of the supposed yearly revolution of the sun around 
the earth. Probably they knew that the radius could be 
applied to the circumference as a chord six times, and that 
each are thus cut off contained 60 degrees. Thus the 
division into 60 parts may have suggested itself. When’ 
greater precision was needed, each degree was divided into 60 
equal parts, or minutes. In this way the sexagesimal notation 
may have originated. The division of the day into 24 hours, 
and of the hour into minutes and seconds on the scale of 60,

is due to the Babylonians. There are also indications of a 
knowledge of sexagesimal fractions,’ such as were used later 
by the Greeks, Arabs, by scholars of the middle ages and of 
even recent times. 
Babylonian science has made its impress upon modern civili- 
zation. Whenever a surveyor copies the readings from the 
graduated circle on his theodolite, whenever the modern man 
notes the time of day, he is, unconsciously perhaps, but 
unmistakably, doing homage to the ancient astronomers on 
the banks of the Euphrates. 
The full development of our decimal notation belongs to 
comparatively modern times. Decimal notation had been in 
use for thousands of years, before it was perceived that its 
simplicity and usefulness could be enormously increased 
by the adoption of the principle of position. [ the Hin- « 
dus of the fifth or sixth century after Christ“we owe the 
full and systematic development of the use of the zero 
and the principle of local value. Of all mathematical dis- 
coveries, no one has contributed more to the general progress 
of intelligence than this. While the older notations served 
merely to record the answer of an arithmetical computation, 
the Hindu notation (wrongly called the Arabic notation) 
assists with marvellous power in performing the computation 
itself. To verify this truth, try to multiply 723 by 364, by 
first expressing the numbers in the Roman notation; thus, 
multiply DCCXXIII by CCCLXIV. This notation offers 
little or no help; the Romans were compelled to invoke 
the aid of the abacus in calculations like this. 
~~~ Very little is known concerning the mode of evolution of the 
Hindu notation. There is evidence for the belief that the 
_ Hindu notation of the second century, a.p., did not include

the zero nor the principle of local value. On the island of 
Ceylon a notation resembling the Hindu, but without the zero, 
has been preserved. It is known that Buddhism and Indian 
culture were transplanted thither about the third century and 
there remained stationary. It is highly probable, then, that 
the notation of Ceylon is the old imperfect Hindu system. 
Besides signs for 1-9, the Ceylon notation has symbols for 
each of the tens and for 100 and 1000. Thus the number 7685 
would have been written with six symbols, designating respec- 
tively the numbers 7, 1000, 6, 100, 80, 5. These so-called 
Singhalesian signs are supposed originally to have been, like 
the old Hindu numerals, the initial letters of the corre- 
sponding numeral adjectives... Unlike the English, the first 
nine Sanscrit numeral adjectives have each a different begin- 
ning, thereby excluding ambiguity. In course of centuries the 
forms of the Hindu letters altered materially, but the letters 
that seem to resemble most closely the apices of Boethius and 
the West-Arabic numerals (which we shall encounter later) are 
the letters of the second century. 
~> The earliest known form of the Indian symbol for zero was 
that of a dot, which was used in inscriptions and manuscripts 
in order to mark a blank. This early use resembles the still 
earlier use made of symbols for zero by the Babylonians and 
by Ptolemy. Probably Aryabhatta in the fifth century a.p. 
knew our zero. The earliest undoubted occurrence of our 
zero in India is in 876 a.p. 
The Hindus possessed several different modes of designating 
numbers. They sometimes found it convenient to use a symbolic 
system of position, in which 1 might be expressed by “moon” 
or “earth,” 2 by “eye,” etc. In the Surya-siddhanta? (a text-

  book of Hindu astronomy) the number 1577917828 is thus 
given: Vasu (a class of deities 8 in number) —two— eight— 
mountain (the 7 mythical chains of mountains) — form — 
figure (the 9 digits) — seven — mountain —lunar days (of 
which there are 15 in the half-month). This notation is cer- 
tainly interesting. It seems to have been applied as a memoria 
technica in order to record dates and numbers. Such a selec- 
tion of synonyms made it much easier to draw up phrases or 
obscure verses for artificial memory. To a limited degree this 
idea may perhaps be advantageously applied by the teacher in 
the schoolroom. ; 
The Hindu notation, in its developed form, reached Europe 
"during the twelfth century. It was transmitted to the Occi-. 
dent through the Arabs, hence the name “ Arabic notation.” 
No blame attaches to the Arabs for this pseudo-name; they 
always acknowledged the notation as an inheritance from 
India. During the 1000 years preceding 1200 a.p., the Hindu 
numerals and notation, while in the various stages of evolu- 
tion, were carried from country to country. Exactly what 
these migrations were, is a problem of extreme difficulty. 
Not even the authorship of the letters of Junius has produced 
so much discussion. The facts to be explained and harmon- 
ized are as follows: 
1. When, toward the close of the last century, scholars 
gradually became convinced that our numerals were not of 
Arabic, but of Hindu origin, the belief was widespread that 
the Arabic and Hindu numerals were essentially identical in 
form. Great was the surprise when a set of Arabic numerals, 
the so-called Gubar-numerals, was discovered, some of which

-P-A-G-E-22
    14 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
bore no resemblance whatever to the modern Hindu characters, 
called Devanagari-numerals. 
2. Closer research showed that the numerals of the Arabs of 
Bagdad differed from those of the Arabs at Cordova, and this 
to such an extent that it was difficult to believe the westerners 
received the digits directly from their eastern neighbours. The 
West-Arabic symbols were the Gubar-numerals mentioned above. 
The Arabic digits can be traced back to the tenth century. 
3. The East and the West Arabs both assigned to the num- 
erals a Hindu origin. “Gubar-numerals ” are “dust-numerals,” 
in memory of the Brahmin practice of reckoning on tablets 
strewn with dust or sand. 
4. Not less startling was the fact that both sets of Arabic 
numerals resembled the apices of Boethius much more closely 
than the modern Devanagari-numerals. The Gubar-numerals 
in particular bore a striking resemblance to the apices. But 
what are the apices? Boethius, a Roman writer of the 
sixth century, wrote a geometry, in which he speaks of an 
abacus, which he attributes to the Pythagoreans. Instead of 
following the ancient practice of using pebbles on the abacus, 
he employed the apices, which were probably small cones. 
Upon each of these was drawn one of the nine digits, now 
called “apices.” These digits occur again in- the body of the 
text. Boethius gives no symbol for zero. 
Need we marvel that, in attempting to harmonize these 
apparently incongruous facts, scholars for a long time failed . 
to agree on an explanation of the strange metamorphoses of 
the numerals, or the course of their fleeting footsteps, as they 
migrated from land to land ? 
The explanation most favourably received is that of Woepcke.?

— > 1. The Hindus possessed the nine numerals without the zero, 
as early as the second century after Christ. It is known that 
about that time a lively commercial intercourse was carried 
on between India and Rome, by way of Alexandria. There 
arose an interchange of ideas as well as of merchandise. The 
Hindus caught glimpses of Greek thought, and the Alexan- 
drians received ideas on philosophy and science from the East. 
2. The nine numerals, without. the zero, thus found their 
way to Alexandria, where they may have attracted the atten- 
tion of the Neo-Pythagoreans. From Alexandria they spread 
to Rome, thence to Spain and the western part of Africa. 
[While the geometry of Boethius (unless the passage relating 
to the apices be considered an interpolation made five or six 
centuries after Boethius) proves the presence of the digits in 
Rome in the fifth century, it must be remarked against this 
part of Woepcke’s theory, that he possesses no satisfactory 
evidence that they were known in Alexandria in the second 
or third century.] ' 
8. Between the second and the eighth centuries the nine 
characters in India underwent changes in shape. A prominent 
Avabic writer, Albirani (died 1038), who was in India dur- 
ing many years, remarks that the shape of Hindu numerals 
and letters differed in different localities and that when (in the 
eighth century) the Hindu notation was transmitted to the 
Arabs, the latter selected from the various forms the most 
suitable. But before the East Arabs thus received the nota- 
tion, it had been perfected by the invention of the zero and 
the application of the principle of position. 
4, Perceiving the great utility of that Columbus-egg, the 
zero, the West Arabs borrowed this epoch-making symbol from 
those in the East, but retained the old forms of the nine num, 
erals, which they had previously received from Rome. The 
reason for this retention may have been a disinclination to

unnecessary change, coupled, perhaps, with a desire to be con- 
trary to their political enemies in the East. . 
5. The West Arabs remembered the Hindu origin of the 
old forms, and called them “Gubar” or “dust” numerals. 
6. After the eighth century the numerals in India under- 
went further changes, and.assumed the greatly modified forms 
of the modern Devanagari-numerals. 
The controversy regarding the origin and transmission of ~ 
our numerals has engaged many minds. Search for infor- 
mation has led to the close consideration of intellectual, 
commercial, and political conditions among the Hindus, Alex- 
andrian Greeks, Romans, and particularly among the East and 
West Arabs. ‘We-have here an excellent illustration of how 
mathematico-historical questions. may give great stimulus to 
the study of the history of civilization, and may throw new 
light upon it.? 
In the history of the art of counting, the teacher finds em- 
phasized certain pedagogical precepts. We have seen how 
universal has been the practice of counting on fingers. In 
place of fingers, groups of other objects were frequently 
chosen, “as when South Sea Islanders count with cocoanut 
stalks, putting a little one aside every time they count to 10, 
and a large one when they come to 100, or when African 
negroes reckon with pebbles or nuts, and every time they come 
td 5 put them aside in a little heap.”? The abstract notion of 
number is here attained through the agency of concrete objects. 
The arithmetical truths that 24+1=3, etc., are here called 
out by eaperience in the manipulation of things. As we shall 
see later, the counting by groups of objects in early times led 
to the invention of the abacus, which is still a valuable school 
instrument. The earliest arithmetical knowledge of a child

should, therefore, be made to grow out of his experience with 
different groups of objects ; never should he be taught count- 
ing by being removed from his toys, and (practically with 
his eyes closed) made to memorize the abstract statements 
141=2,2+41=83, ete. Primitive counting in its mode of 
evolution emphasizes the value of object-teaching. 
Recent research' seems to indicate that the principle of 
local value and the use of the zero received systematic and full 
development in America several centuries earlier than in Asia. 
The credit of this achievement belongs to the Maya of Central 
America. About the beginning of the Christian era the Maya 
possessed a fully developed number-system and chronology. 
Theirs was not the decimal, but the vigesimal notation. Their 
system, as exhibited in their codices, was based on the scale 
of 20, except in the third position. That is, 20 units of the 
lowest order (kins, or days) make 1 unit of next higher order 
(uinals, or 20 days), 18 uinals make 1 tun (360 days, the Maya 
official year), 20 tuns make 1 katun (7200 days), 20 katuns 
make 1 cycle, and 20 cycles make 1 great cycle. The numbers 
1-19 are expressed by bars and dots. Each bar stands for 5, 
each dot for 1. Thus, -+ is 2, + is 6. The zero is repre- 
sented by a symbol that looks roughly like a half-closed eye. 
Accordingly, 87 was expressed by the symbols for 17 (three 
bars and two dots) in the kin place, and one dot representing 
20 in the uinal place, higher up. The numbers were written 
vertically. To write 360, the Maya drew two zeros, one above 
the other, with a dot in third place, above the zeros. The 
largest number found in the codices is 12,489,781.

  ARITHMETIC AND ALGEBRA 
  EGYPT 
Tue most ancient mathematical handbook known to our 
time is a papyrus included in the Rhind collection of the 
British Museum. This interesting hieratic document, de- 
scribed by Birch in 1868, and translated by Eisenlohr’ in 
1877, was written by an Egyptian, Ahmes by name, in the 
reign of Ra-d-us, some time between 1700 and 2000 z.c. It is 
entitled: “Directions for obtaining the knowledge of all dark 
things.” It claims to be founded on older documents pre-- 
pared in the time of King [Ra-en-m]at. Unless specialists 
are in error regarding the name of this last king, Ra-en-mat, 
[{ie. Amenemhat III.], whose name is not legible in the 
papyrus, it follows that the original is many centuries older 
than the copy made by Ahmes. The Ahmes papyrus, there- 
fore, gives us an idea of Egyptian geometry, arithmetic, and 
algebra as it existed certainly as early as_1700_B.c., and 
possibly as early as 3000 8,c. While it does not disclege as 
extensive mathematical knowledge as one might expect to find 
among the builders of the pyramids, it nevertheless shows in

  20 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
several particulars a remarkably advanced state of mathe. 
matics at the time when Abraham visited Egypt. 
From the Ahmes papyrus we infer that the Egyptians knew 
nothing of theoretical results. It contains no theorems, and 
hardly any general rules of procedure. In most cases the 
writer treats in succession several problems of the same kind. 
From them it would be easy, by induction, to obtain general 
rules, but this is not done. When we remember that only one 
hundred years ago it was the practice of many English arith- 
metical writers to postpone the discussion of fractions to the 
end of their books, it is surprising to find that this hand-book 
of 4000 years ago begins with exercises in fractions, and pays 
but little attention to whole numbers. Gow probably is right 
in his conjecture that Ahmes wrote for the élite mathematicians 
of his day. 
While fractions occur in the oldest mathematical records 
which have been found, the ancients nevertheless attained 
little proficiency in them. Evidently this subject was one of 
great difficulty. Simultaneous changes in both numerator and 
denominator were usually avoided. Fractions are found among 
the Babylonians. Not only had they sexagesimal divisions of 
weights and measures, but also sexagesimal fractions.! These 
fractions had a constant denominator (60), and were indicated 
by writing the numerator a little to the right of the ordinary 
position for a word or number, the denominator being under- 
stood. We shall see that the Romans likewise usually kept 
the denominators constant, but equal to 12. The Egyptians 
and Greeks, on the other hand, kept the numerators constant 
and dealt with variable denominators. Ahmes confines him- 
self to fractions of a special class, namely wnit-fractions, having 
unity for their numerators. A fraction was designated by 
1 Cantor, Vol. L., pp. 28, 31.  
-P-A-G-E-29

EGYPT 21 
writing the denominator and then placing over it either a dot 
or a symbol, called vo. Fractional values which could not be 
expressed by any one unit-fraction were represented by the sum 
of two or more of them. Thus he wrote } , in place of 3. 
It is curious to observe that while Ahmes knows % to equal } }, 
he makes an exception in this case, adopts a special symbol 
for 2, and allows it to appear often among the unit-fractions.* 
A fundamental problem in Ahmes’s treatment of fractions was, 
how to find the unit-fractions, the sum of which represents a 
given fractional value. This was done by aid of a table, given 
in the papyrus, in which all fractions of the form   25 
+1 
(n designating successively all integers up to 49) are reduced to 
the sum of unit-fractions. Thus, 4 =) dy #=ds dei 
six With aid of this table Ahmes could work out problems 
like these, “Divide 2 by 3,” “Divide 2 by 17,” etc. Ahmes 
nowhere states why he confines himself to 2 as the numer- 
ator, nor does he inform us how, when, and by whom the table 
was constructed. It is plain, however, that by the use of 
this table any fraction whose denominator is odd and less than 
100, can be represented as the sum of unit-fractions. The 
division of 5 by 21 may have been accomplished as follows: 
5=1+4+2+42. From the table we get 2-= 7, gy Then 
PaAtG D+G Matte Manta tA 
=+ 3,7. It may be remarked that there are many ways of 
breaking up a fraction into unit-fractions, but Ahmes invariably 
gives only one. Contrary to his usual practice, he gives a 
general rule for multiplying a fraction by 3. He says: “If 
you are asked, what is 3 of 4, take the double and the sixfold; 
that is 3 of it. One must proceed likewise for any other frac- 
tion.” As only the denominator was written down, he means

The papyrus contains 17 examples which show by what a 
fraction or a mixed number must be multiplied, or what must 
be added to it, to obtain a given value. The method consists 
in the reduction of the given fractions to a common denomina- 
tor. Strange to say, the latter is not always chosen so as to 
be exactly divisible by all the given denominators. Ahmes 
gives the example, increase } 45 35 #s to 1. The common 
denominator taken appears to be 45, for the numbers are 
stated as 114, 544, 44, 14,1. The sum of these is 23444 
forty-fifths. Add to this 4 #5, and the sum is % Add 4,

namely, that of aliquot parts, used largely in Practice. In the 
second of the above examples aliquot parts are taken of %. 
This process is seen again in Ahmes’s calculations to verify 
the identities in the table of unit-fractions. 
Ahmes then proceeds to eleven problems leading to simple 
equations with one unknown quantity. The unknown is called 
hau or ‘heap.’ Symbols are used to designate addition, sub- 
traction, and equality. We give the following specimen : ?

Here fb stands for 3, -— for 4. Other unit-fractions are 
indicated by writing the number and placing <>, ro, above it. 
A problem resembling the one just given ee “ Heap, its 3, 
its 4, its }, its whole, it makes 33;” ie. ae +3 az +2 = 33. 
The solution proceeds as follows: 12442=33. Then1244 
is multiplied in the manner sketched above, so as to - 33, 
thereby obtaining heap equal to 14 4 gy 35 sty rhe ha she 
Here, then, we have the solution of an algebraic equation ! 
In this Egyptian document, as also among early Babylonian 
records, are found examples of arithmetical and geometrical 
progressions. Ahmes gives an example: “ Divide 100 loaves 
among 5 persons; + of what the first three get is what the last 
two get. What is the difference?” *? Ahmes gives the solu- 
tion: “Make the difference 54; 23, 173, 12, 64,1. Multiply

by 13; 384, 293, 20, 10 3 4, 13.” How did Ahmes come upon 
5}? Perhaps thus:' Let a and —d be the first term and 
the difference in the required arithmetical progression, then 
4[a+ (a —d) + (a—2d)] = (a~— 3d) + (a— 4d), whence d= 
54(@— 4d), ie. the difference d is 5} times the last term. 
Assuming the last term = 1, he gets his first progression. The 
sum is 60, but should be 100; hence multiply by 13, for 
60 x 13=100. We have here a method of solution which 
appears again later among the Hindus, Arabs, and modern 
Europeans—the method of false position. It will be ex- 
plained more fully elsewhere. 
Still more curious is the following in Ahmes. He speaks 
of a ladder consisting of the numbers 7, 49, 343, 2401, 16807. 
Adjacent to these powers of 7 are the words picture, cat, mouse, 
barley, measure. Nothing in the papyrus gives a clue to the 
meaning of this, but Cantor thinks the key to be found in the 
following problem occurring 3000 years later in the liber abaci 
(1202 a.p.) of Leonardo of Pisa: 7 old women go to Rome; 
each woman has 7 mules, each mule carries 7 sacks, each sack 
contains 7 loaves, with each loaf are 7 knives, each knife is 
put in 7 sheaths. What is the sum total of all named? This 
has suggested the following wording in Ahmes: 7 persons 
have each 7 cats; each cat eats 7 mice, each mouse eats 7 ears 
of barley, from each ear 7 measures of corn may grow. What 
is the series arising from these data, what the sum of its 
terms? Ahmes gives the numbers, also their sum, 19607. 
Problems of’ this sort may have been proposed for amusement. 
If the above interpretations are correct, it looks as if “mathe- 
matical recreations” were indulged in by scholars forty 
centuries ago. 
In the haw-problems, of which we gave one example, we see 
the beginnings of algebra. So far as documentary evidence 
1 Cantor, Vol. I., p. 78.
-P-A-G-E-33
EGYPT 25 
goes, arithmetic and algebra are coeval. That arithmetic if 
actually the older there can be no doubt. But mark the 
close relation between them at the very beginning of authentic 
history. So in mathematical teaching there ought to be an 
intimate union between the two. In the United States algebra 
was for a long time set aside, while extraordinary emphasis 
was laid on arithmetic. The readjustment has come. The 
“Mathematical Conference of Ten” of 1892 voiced the senti- 
ment of the best educators when it recommended the earlier 
introduction of certain parts of elementary algebra. 
The part of Ahmes’s papyrus which has to the greatest 
degree taxed the ingenuity of specialists is the table of unit- 
fractions. How was it constructed? Some hold that it was 
not computed by any one person, nor even in one single epoch, 
and that the method of construction was not the same for all 
fractions. On the other hand Loria thinks he has discovered 
a general mode by which this and similar existing tables may 
have been calculated. 
That the period of Ahmes was a flowering time for Egyptian 
mathematics appears from the fact that there exist two other 
papyri of this period, containing quadratic equations! They 
were found at Kahun, south of the pyramid of Illahun, These 
documents bear close resemblance to Ahmes’s, as does also the 
Akhmim papyrus, recently discovered at Akhmim, a city on

  26 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
* Phe Nile in Upper Egypt. It is in Greek and is supposed to 
have been written at some time between 500 and 800 a.v. Like 
his ‘ancient predecessor Ahmes, its author gives tables of unit- 
fractions. It marks no progress over the arithmetic of Ahmes. 
For more than two thousand years Egyptian mathematics was 
stationary | 
GREECE 
In passing to Greek arithmetic and algebra, we first observe 
that the early Greeks were not automaths; they acknowledged 
the Egyptian priests to have been their teachers. While in 
geometry the Greeks soon reached a height undreamed of by 
the Egyptian mind, they contributed hardly anything to the 
art of calculation. Not until the golden period of geometric 
discovery had passed away, do we find in Nicomachus and 
Diophantus substantial contributors to algebra. 
Greek mathematicians were in the habit of discriminating 
between the science of numbers and the art of computation. 
The former they called arithmetica, the latter logistica. 
Greek writers seldom refer to calculation with alphabetic 
numerals. Addition, subtraction, and even multiplication were 
probably performed on the abacus. Eutocius, a commentator 
of the sixth century a.p., exhibits a great many multiplications, 
such as expert Greek mathematicians of classical time may 
have used.1_ While among the Sophists computation received 
some attention, it was pronounced a vulgar and childish 
art by Plato, who cared only for the philosophy of arithmetic. 
Greek writers did not confine themselves to unit-fractions as 
closely as did the Egyptians. Unit-fractions were designated 
by simply writing the denominator with a double accent.

Thus, pB" = 71y. Other fractions were usually indicated by 
writing the numerator once with an accent and the denominay’ 
tor twice with a double accent. Thus, f'ka"'ko!'= 11. As 
with the Egyptians, unit-fractions in juxtaposition are to be 
added. 
Like the Eastern nations, the Egyptians and Greeks employ 
two aids to computation, the abacus and finger symbolism. It 
is not known what the signs used in the latter were, but by the 
study of ancient statuary, bas-reliefs, and paintings this secret 
may yet be unravelled. Of the abacus there existed many 
forms at different times and among the various nations. In 
all cases a plane was divided into regions and a pebble or other 
object represented a different value in different regions. We 
possess no detailed information regarding the Egyptian or 
the Greek abacus. Herodotus (II., 36) says that the Egyp- 
tians “calculate with pebbles by moving the hand from right 
to left, while the Hellenes move it from left to right.” This 
indicates a primitive and instrumental mode of counting with 
aid of pebbles. The fact that the hand was moved towards the 
right, or towards the left, indicates that the plane or board was 
divided by lines which were vertical, t.e. up and down, with 
respect to the computor. JIamblichus informs us that the 
abacus of the Pythagoreans was a board strewn with dust or 
sand. In that case, any writing could be easily erased by 
sprinkling the board anew. A pebble placed in the right hand 
space or column designated 1, if placed in the second column 
from the right 10, if in the third column 100, ete. Probably, 
never more than nine pebbles were placed in one column, for 
ten of them would equal one unit of the next higher order. 
The Egyptians on the other hand chose the column on the 
extreme left as the place for units, the second column from the 
left designating tens, the third hundreds, etc. In further 
support of this description of the abacus, a comparison attrib- ‘

uted by Diogenes Laertius (I., 59) to Solon is interesting:' “A 
person friendly with tyrants is like the stone in computation, 
which signifies now much, now little.” 
The abacus appears to have been used in Egypt and Greece 
to carry out the simpler calculation with integers. The hand- 
book of Ahmes with its treatment of fractions was presumably 
written for those already familiar with abacal or digital reck- 
oning. Greek mathematical works usually give the numerical 
results without exhibiting the computation itself. Thus 
advanced mathematicians frequently had occasion to extract 
the square root. In his Mensuration of the Circle, Archimedes 
states, for instance, that V3 < 1351 and V3 > 285, but he 
gives no clue to his method of approximation.? 
When sexagesimal numbers (introduced from Babylonia 
into Greece about the time of the Greek geometer Hypsicles 
and the Alexandrian astronomer Ptolemezus) were used, then 
the mode of root-extraction resembled that of the present time. 
A specimen of the process, as given by Theon, the father of 
Hypatia, has been preserved. He finds V4500° = 67° 4! 55". 
Archimedes showed how the Greek system of numeration 
might be extended so as to embrace numbers as large as you 
please. By the ordinary nomenclature of his day, numbers 
could be expressed up to 10% Taking this 10% as a unit of 
second order, 10% as one of the third order, etc., the system 
may be sufficiently extended to enable one to count the very 
sands. Assuming 10,000 grains of sand to fill the space of a 
poppy-seed, he finds a number which would exceed the number 
1 Cantor, Vol. I., p. 182. 
2 What the Archimedean and, in general, the Greek method of root- 
extraction really was, has been a favourite subject of conjecture. See for 
example, H. Weissensorn’s Berechnung des Kreisumfanges bei Archi- 
medes und Leonardo Pisano, Berlin, 1894. For bibliography of this sub-

of grains in a sphere whose radius extends from the earth to 
the fixed stars. A counterpart of this interesting speculation, 
called the “sand-counter” (arenarius), is found in a calcula- 
tion attributed to Buddha, the Hindu reformer, of the number 
of primary atoms in a line one mile in length, when the atoms 
are placed one against another. 
The science of numbers, as distinguished from the art of 
calculation, commanded the lively attention of the Pythago- 
reans. Pythagoras himself had imbibed Egyptian mathemat- 
ics and mysticism. Aside from the capital discovery of 
irrational quantities (spoken of elsewhere) no very substantial 
contribution was made by the Pythagoreans to the science of 
numbers. We may add that by the Greeks irrationals were 
not classified as numbers. The Pythagoreans sought the 
origin of all things in numbers; harmony depended on musi- 
cal proportion; the order and beauty of the universe have 
their origin in numbers; in the planetary motions they dis- 
cerned a wonderful “harmony of the spheres.’ Moreover, 
some numbers had extraordinary attributes. Thus, one is the 
essence of things; four is the most perfect number, correspond- 
ing to the human soul. According to Philolaus, 5 is the cause 
of colour, 6 of cold, 7 of mind, health, and light, 8 of love and 
friendship... Even Plato and Aristotle refer the virtues to, 
numbers. While these speculations in themselves were fan- 
tastic and barren, lines of fruitful mathematical inquiry were 
suggested by them. 
The Pythagoreans classified numbers into odd and even, 
and observed that the sum of the odd numbers from 1 to 
2n+1 was always a perfect square. Of no particular value 
were their classifications of numbers into heteromecie, trian- 
gular, perfect, excessive, defective, amicable.” The Pythag-

  30 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
oreans paid much attention to the subject of proportion. The 
quantities a, b, c, d, were said to be in arithmetical proportion, 
when a—b=c—d; in geometrical proportion, when a:b =c:d; 
in harmonic proportion, when a—6:b—c=a:c; in musical 
proportion, when a:}(@+0)=2ab/(a+b):b. Iamblichus 
says that the last was introduced from Babylon. 
The 7th, 8th, and 9th books of Euclid’s Elements are on the 
science of number, but the 2d and 10th, though professedly 
geometrical and treating of magnitudes, are applicable to 
numbers. Euclid was a geometer through and through, and 
even his arithmetical books smack of geometry. Consider, for 
instance, definition 21, book VII. “Plane and solid numbers 
“are similar when their sides are proportional.” Again, num- 
bers are not written in numerals, nor are they designated by 
anything like our modern algebraic notation; they are repre- 
sented by lines. This symbolism is very unsuggestive. Fre- 
quently properties which our notation unmasks at once could 
be extracted from these lines only through a severe process of 
reasoning.” 
In the 7th book we encounter for the first time a definition 
of prime numbers. Euclid finds the G. C.D. of two numbers 
by a procedure identical with our method by division. He 
applies to numbers the theory of proportion which in the 5th 
book is developed for magnitudes in general. The 8th book 
deals with numbers in continued proportion. The 9th book 
finishes that subject, deals with primes, and contains the proof 
for the remarkable theorem 20, that the number of primes is 
infinite. 
During the four centuries after Euclid, geometry monopo- 
lized the attention of the Greeks and the theory of numbers

was neglected. Of this period only two names deserve men- 
tion, Eratosthenes (about 275-194 B.c.) and Hypsicles (between 
200 and 100 B.c.). To the latter we owe researches on polyg- 
onal numbers and arithmetical progressions. Eratosthenes 
invented the celebrated “sieve” for finding prime numbers. 
Write down in succession all odd numbers from 3 up. By 
erasing every third number after 3, sift out all multiples of 3; 
by erasing every fifth number after 5, sift out all multiples 
of 5, and so on. The numbers left after this sifting are all 
prime. While the invention of the “sieve” called for no 
great mental powers, it is remarkable that after Eratosthenes 
no advance was made in the mode of finding the primes, nor in 
the determination of the number of primes which exist in the 
numerical series 1, 2, 3,..., until the nineteenth century, 
when Gauss, Legendre, Dirichlet, Riemann, and Chebichev 
enriched the subject with investigations mostly of great diffi- 
culty and complexity. 
The study of arithmetic was revived about 100 a.p. by 
Nicomachus,' a native of Gerasa (perhaps a town in Arabia) 
and known as a Pythagorean. He wrote in Greek a work 
entitled Introductio Arithmetica. The historical importance of 
this work is great, not so much on account of original matter 
therein contained, but because it is (so far as we know) the 
earliest systematic text-book on arithmetic, and because for 
over 1000 years it set the fashion for the treatment of this 
subject in Europe. In a small measure, Nicomachus did for 
arithmetic what Euclid did for geometry. His arithmetic was 
as famous in his day as was, later, Adam Riese’s in Germany, 
and Cocker’s in England. Wishing to compliment a computor, 
Lucian says, “ You reckon like Nicomachus of Gerasa.”? The

work was brought out in a Latin translation by Appuleius 
(now lost) and then by Boethius. In Boethius’s translation 
the elementary parts of the work were in high authority in 
Western Europe until the country was invaded by Hindu 
arithmetic. Thereupon for several centuries Greek arithmetic 
bravely but vainly struggled for existence against its immeas- 
urably superior Indian rival. 
The style of Nicomachus differs essentially from that of his 
predecessors. It is not deductive, but inductive. The geo- 
metrical style is abandoned; the different classes of numbers 
are exhibited in actual numerals. The author’s main object is 
classification. Being under the influence of philosophy and 
theology, he sometimes strains a point to secure a division into 
groups of three. Thus, odd numbers are either “prime and 
uncompounded,” “compounded,” or “compounded but prime 
to one another.” His nomenclature resulting from this classi- 
fication is exceedingly burdensome. The Latin equivalents 
for his Greek terms are found in the printed arithmetics of his 
m+1 
m   
disciples, 1500 years later. Thus the ratio is super- 
particularis, aaa is subsuperparticularis, 34 = 3x44 a 1 ig 
triplex sesquiquartus.! Nicomachus gives tables of numbers in 
form of a chess-board of 100 squares. It might have answered 
as a multiplication-table, but it appears to have been used in 
the study of ratios.2?, He describes polygonal numbers, the 
different kinds of proportions (11 in all), and treats of the 
summation of numerical series. To be noted is the absence of 
tules of computation, of problem-working, and of practical 
arithmetic. He gives the following important proposition. 
All cubical numbers are equal to the sum of successive odd

numbers. Thus, 8=28=3+5; 27=3?=74+9+411; 64= 
44—13415417+419. 
In the writings of Nicomachus, Iamblichus, Theon of 
Smyrna, Thymaridas, and others, are found investigations 
algebraic in their nature. Thymaridas in one place uses a 
Greek word meaning “unknown quantity” in a manner sug- 
gesting the near approach of algebra. Of interest in tracing 
the evolution of algebra are the arithmetical epigrams in the 
Palatine Anthology, which contained about 50 problems leading 
to linear equations.! Before the introduction of algebra, these 
problems were propounded as puzzles. No. 23 gives the times 
in which four fountains can fill a reservoir separately and 
requires the time they can fill it conjointly.? No. 9. What 
part of the day has disappeared, if the time left is twice two- 
thirds of the time passed away? Sometimes included among 
these epigrams is the famous “cattle-problem,” which Archi- 
medes is said to have propounded to the Alexandrian mathe- 
maticians.’ This difficult problem is indeterminate. In the 
first part of it, from only seven equations, eight unknown 
quantities in integral numbers are to be found. Gow states 
it thus: The sun had a herd of bulls and cows, of different 
colours. (1) Of Bulls, the white (W) were in number (}+ 4) 
of the blue (B) and yellow (Y); the B were (4+ 4) of the Y 
and piebald (P); the P were (4+ 4) of the Wand Y. (2) Of 
Cows, which had the same colours (w, 6, y, p), w =(4 + 4)(B + d); 
b=444)(P+p); PHE+H(V+Ys ¥=E+H)(W+e).

Constantine the Great. For a German translation, see G. WrrTHEIM,

Find the number of bulls and cows. This leads to excessively 
high numbers, but to add to its complexity, a second series of 
conditions is superadded, leading to an indeterminate equa- 
tion of the second degree. 
Most of the problems in the Palatine Anthology, though 
puzzling to an arithmetician, are easy to an algebraist. Such 
problems became popular about the time of Diophantus and 
doubtless acted as a powerful mental stimulus. 
Diophantus, one of the last Alexandrian mathematicians, is 
generally regarded as an algebraist of great fertility.1 He 
died about 330 a.p. His age was 84, as is known from an 
epitaph to the following effect: Diophantus passed } of his 
life in childhood, #; in youth, and 4+ more as a bachelor; five 
years after his marriage, was born a son who died four years 
before his father, at half his father’s age. This epitaph states 
about all we know of Diophantus. We are uncertain as to the 
time of his death and ignorant of his parentage and place of 
nativity. Were his works not written in Greek, no one would 
suspect them of being the product of Greek mind. The spirit 
pervading his masterpiece, the Arithmetica [said to have been 
written in thirteen books, of which only six (seven ?)? are ex- 
tant] is as different from that of the great classical works of 
the time of Euclid as pure geometry is from pure analysis. 
Among the Greeks, Diophantus had no prominent forerunner, 
no prominent disciple. Except for his works, we should be 
obliged to say that the Greek mind accomplished nothing 
notable in algebra. Before the discovery of the Ahmes 
papyrus, the Arithmetica of Diophantus was the oldest known 
work on algebra. Diophantus introduces the notion of an 
algebraic equation expressed in symbols. Being completely

GREECE 85 
divorced from geometry, his treatment is purely analytical. 
He is the first to say that “a number to be subtracted multi- 
plied by a number to be subtracted gives a number to be 
added.” This is applied to differences, like (2% — 3) (2a —3), 
the product of which he finds without resorting to geometry. 
Identities like (a + 6)?=a?+2ab+0*, which are elevated 
by Euclid to the exalted rank of geometric theorems, with 
Diophantus are the simplest consequences of algebraic laws of 
operation. Diophantus represents the unknown quantity x by 
s', the square of the unknown «? by 8, 2* by x’, x by 88°. 
His sign for subtraction is 7, his symbol for equality, . Addi- 
tion is indicated by juxtaposition. Sometimes he ignores these 
symbols and describes operations in words, when the symbols 
would have answered better. In a polynomial all the positive 
terms are written before any of the negative ones. Thus, 
a —5a®+8a—1 would be in his notation, «°as"y pou. 
Here the numerical coefficient follows the a. 
To be emphasized is the fact that in Diophantus the funda- 
mental algebraic conception of negative numbers is wanting. 
In 2¢—10 he avoids as absurd all cases where 2x < 10. 
Take Probl. 16 Bk. I. in his Arithmetica: “To find three num- 
bers such that the sums of each pair are given numbers.” If 
a, b, ¢ are the given numbers, then one of the required numbers 
is}(a+b+ce)—c. Ife>}(a+b +0), then this result is unin- 
telligible to Diophantus. Hence he imposes upon the problem 
the limitation, “ But half the sum of the three given numbers 
must be greater than any one singly.” Diophantus does not 
give solutions general in form. In the present instance the 
special values 20, 30, 40 are assumed as the given numbers. 
In problems leading to simultaneous equations Diophantus 
adroitly uses only one symbol for the unknown quantities. 
1 Heat, op. cit., p. 72.
-P-A-G-E-44
  
  86 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
This poverty in notation is offset in many cases merely 
by skill in the selection of the unknown. Frequently he 
follows a method resembling somewhat the Hindu “false 
position”: a preliminary value is assigned to the unknown 
which satisfies only one or two of the necessary conditions. 
This leads to expressions palpably wrong, but nevertheless 
suggesting some stratagem by which one of the correct 
values can be obtained.’ 
Diophantus knows how to solve quadratic equations, but in 
the extant books of his Arithmetica he nowhere explains the 
mode of solution. Noteworthy is the fact that he always gives 
but one of the two roots, even when both roots are positive. 
Nor does he ever accept as an answer to a problem a quantity 
which is negative or irrational. 
Only the first book in the Avrithmetica is devoted to deter- 
minate equations. It is in the solution of indeterminate 
equations (of the second degree) that he exhibits his wonderful 
inventive faculties. However, his extraordinary ability lies 
less in discovering general methods than in reducing all sorts 
of equations to particular forms which he knows how to solve. 
Each of his numerous and various problems has its own distinct 
method of solution, which is often useless in the most closely 
related problem. “It is, therefore, difficult for a modern 
mathematician, after studying 100 Diophantine solutions, 
to solve the 101st.... Diophantus dazzles more than he 
delights.”’* 
The absence in Diophantus of general methods for dealing 
with indeterminate problems compelled modern workers on 
this subject, such as Euler, Lagrange, Gauss, to begin anew.

88-120, takes exception to Hankel’s verdict and endeavours to give a 
general account of Diophantine methods.

Diophantus could teach them nothing in the way of general 
methods. The result is that the modern theory of numbers is 
quite distinct and a decidedly higher and nobler science than 
Diophantine Analysis. Modern disciples of Diophantus usually 
display the weaknesses of their master and for that reason 
have failed to make substantial contributions to the subject. 
Of special interest to us is the method followed by Diophan- 
tus in solving a linear determinate equation. His directions 
are: “If now in any problem the same powers of the unknown 
occur on both sides of the equation, but with different coeffi- 
cients, we must subtract equals from equals until we have one 
term equal to one term. If there are on one side, or on both 
sides, terms with negative coefficients, these terms must be 
added on both sides, so that on both sides there are only posi- 
tive terms. Then we must again subtract equals from equals 
until there remains only one term in each number.”! Thus 
what is nowadays achieved by transposing, simplifying, and 
dividing by the coefficient of 2, was accomplished by Diophan- 
tus by addition and subtraction. It is to be observed that in 
Diophantus, and in fact in all writings of antiquity, the con- 
ception of a quotient is wanting. An operation of division is 
nowhere exhibited. When one number had to be divided by 
another, the answer was reached by repeated subtractions.’ 
ROME 
Of Roman methods of computation more is known than of 
Greek or Egyptian. Abacal reckoning was taught in schools. 
Writers refer to pebbles and a dust-covered abacus, ruled 
into columns. An Etruscan (?) relic, now preserved in Paris, 
shows a computor holding in his left hand an abacus with

numerals set in columns, while with the right hand he lays 
pebbles upon the table." 
The Romans used also another kind of abacus, consisting of 
a metallic plate having grooves with movable buttons. By its 
use all integers between 1 and 9,999,999, as well as some frac- 
tions, could be represented. In the two adjoining figures 
(taken from Fig. 21 in Friedlein) the lines represent grooves

| aq and the circles buttons. The Roman numerals indicate the 
value of each button in the corresponding groove below, 
the button in the shorter groove above having a fivefold value. 
Thus ii =1,000,000; hence each button in the long left-hand 
groove, when in use, stands for 1,000,000, and the button in the 
short upper groove stands for 5,000,000. ‘The same holds for 
the other grooves labelled by Roman numerals. The eighth 
long groove from the left (having 5 buttons) represents duo- 
decimal fractions, each button indicating j,, while the button 
above the dot means ;%; In the ninth column the upper 
button represents 1;, the middle #,, and two lower each y. 
Our first figure represents the positions of the buttons before 
the operation begins ; our second figure stands for the number 
8524.4,;. The eye has here to distingtiish the buttons in use 
and those left idle. Those counted are one button above c Bee

c (= 500), and three buttons below c (=300); one button 
above x (=50); two buttons below I (=2); four buttons 
indicating duodecimals (= 4); and the button for 3. 
Suppose now that 10,31844, is to be added to 852 44. 
The operator could begin with the highest units, or the lowest 
units, as he pleased. Naturally the hardest part is the addi- 
tion of the fractions. In this case the button for ~,, the button 
above the dot and three buttons below the dot were used to 
indicate the sum 3;. The addition of 8 would bring all the 
buttons above and below 1 into play, making 10 units. Hence, 
move them all back and move up one button in the groove 
below x. Add 10 by moving up another of the buttons below 
x; add 300 to 800 by moving back all buttons above and below 
c, except one button below, and moving up one button below 1 
add 10,000 by moving up one button below x. In subtraction 
the operation was similar. 
Multiplication could be carried out in several ways. In case 
of 38 4.44 times 25 4, the abacus may have shown successively 
the following values: 600(= 30-20), 760(= 600 +20 - 8), 
770 (= 760 +4. 20), 770 49 (= 770 + 4 - 20), 92048 (= 77019 
+ 30-5), 96049 (= 9201248.-5), 9634 (= 96012 +4.-5), 
963 4 wy (= 9634 + y+ 5), 973-4 ry (= 963 toy + 4 - 30), 976 Ys te (= 973 4 ye + 8-4), O76 Say (= 976 Yo ate + 4° 4), 
976 $e fy (= 976 bot + B+ ae) In division the abacus was used to represent the remainder 
resulting from the subtraction from the dividend of the divisor 
or of a convenient multiple of the divisor. The process was 
complicated and difficult. These methods of abacal computa- 
tion show clearly how multiplication or division can be 
carried out by a series of successive additions or subtractions. 
In this connection we suspect that recourse was had to mental

operations and to the multiplication table. Finger-reckoning 
may also have been used. In any case the multiplication and 
division with large numbers must have been beyond the power 
of the ordinary computor. This difficulty was sometimes 
obviated by the use of arithmetical tables from which the 
required sum, difference, or product of two numbers could be 
copied. Tables of this sort were prepared by Victorius of 
Aquitania, a writer who is well known for his canon paschulis, 
a rule for finding the correct date for Easter, which he pub- 
lished in 457 a.p. The tables of Victorius contain a peculiar 
notation for fractions, which continued in use throughout the 
middle ages.! Fractions occur among the Romans most fre- 
quently in money computations. 
The Roman partiality to duodecimal fractions is to be 
observed. Why duodecimals and not decimals? Doubtless 
because the decimal division of weights and measures seemed 
unnatural. In everyday affairs the division of units into 2, 3, 
4,6 equal parts is the commonest, and duodecimal fractions 
give easier expressions for these parts. In duodecimals the 
above parts are 5%, 74, 73, 2 of the whole; in decimals these 
5 3h 23 12 parts are 7) Dy io’ io" 
with concrete fractions. The Roman as, originally a copper 
coin weighing one pound, was divided into 12 unciw. The 
abstract fraction 1} was expressed concretely by deunx (= de 
uncia, i.e., as [1] less uncia [;]); 7 was called quinewne 
(= quinque [five] unciw); thus each Roman fraction had a 
special name. Addition and subtraction of such fractions were 
easy. Fractional computations were the chief part of arith- 
metical instruction in Roman schools.? Horace, in remem- 
brance, perhaps, of his own school-days, gives the following Unlike the Greeks, the Romans dealt

dialogue between teacher and pupil (Ars poetica, V. 326-330) : 
“Tet the son of Albinus tell me, if from five ounces [i.e. 35] 
be subtracted one ounce [i.e. ;], what is the remainder? 
_ Come, you can tell. ‘One-third.’ Good; you will be able to 
take care of your property. If one ounce [i.e. ;';] be added, 
what does it make? ‘One-half.’” 
Doubtless the Romans unconsciously hit upon a fine 
pedagogical idea in their concrete treatment of fractions. 
Roman boys learned fractions in connection with money, 
weights, and measures. We conjecture that to them fractions 
meant more than what was conveyed by the definition, 
“broken number,” given in old English arithmetics. 
One of the last Roman writers was Boethius (died 524), who 
is to be mentioned in this connection as the author of a work, 
De Institutione Arithmetica, essentially a translation of the 
arithmetic of Nicomachus, although some of the most beau- 
tiful arithmetical results in the original are omitted by 
Boethius. The historical importance of this translation lies 
in the extended use made of it later in Western Europe. 
The Roman laws of inheritance gave rise to numerous arith- 
metical examples. The following is of interest in itself, and 
also because its occurrence elsewhere at a later period assists 
us in tracing the source of arithmetical knowledge in Western 
Europe: A dying man wills, that if his wife, being with child, 
gives birth to a son, the son shall receive %, and she 4 of his 
estate; but if a daughter is born, the daughter shall receive 
4, and the wife 3. It happens that twins are born, a boy and 
a girl. How shall the estate be divided so as to satisfy the 
will? The celebrated Roman jurist, Salvianus Julianus, 
decided that it should be divided into seven equal parts, of 
which four should go to the son, two to the wife and one 
to the daughter. 
Aside from the (probable) improvement of the abacus and

the development of duodecimal fractions, the Romans made no 
contributions to arithmetic. The algebra of Diophantus was 
unknown to them. With them as with all nations of antiquity 
numerical calculations were long and tedious, for the reason 
that they never possessed the boon of a perfect notation of 
numbers with its zero and principle of local value.

GEOMETRY AND TRIGONOMETRY 
  EGYPT AND BABYLONIA 
Tue crude beginnings of empirical geometry, like the art of 
counting, must be of very ancient origin. We suspect that our 
earliest records, reaching back to about 2500 B.c., represent 
comparatively modern thought. The Ahmes papyrus and the 
Egyptian pyramids are probably the oldest evidences of geo- — 
metrical study. We find it more convenient, however, to 
begin with Babylonia. Ancient science is closely knitted with 
superstition. We have proofs that in Babylonia geometrical 
figures were used in augury.’ Among these figures are a pair 
of parallel lines, a square, a figure with a re-entrant angle, and 
an incomplete figure, believed to represent three concentric tri- 
angles with their sides respectively parallel. The accompany- 
ing text contains the Sumerian word tim, meaning “line,” 
originally “rope”; hence the conjecture that the Babylonians, 
like the Egyptians, used ropes in measuring distances, and in 
determining certain angles. The Babylonian sign ¥ is be- 
lieved to be associated with the division of the circle into six 
equal parts, and (as the Babylonians divided the circle into 
360 degrees) with the origin of the sexagesimal system. That 
this division into six parts (probably by the sixfold application 
of the radius) was known in Babylonia, follows from the in- 
spection of the six spokes in the wheel of a royal carriage

represented in a drawing found in the remains of Nineveh. 
Like the Hebrews (1 Kings vii. 23), the Babylonians took the 
ratio of the circumference to the diameter equal to 3, a de- 
cidedly inaccurate value. Of geometrical demonstrations there 
is no trace. “As a rule, in. the Oriental mind the intuitive 
powers eclipse the severely rational and logical.” 
We begin our account of Egyptian geometry with the geo- 
metrical problems of the Ahmes papyrus, which are found in 
the middle of the arithmetical matter. Calculations of the 
solid contents of barns precede the determination of areas.’ 
Not knowing the shape of the barns, we cannot verify the cor- . 
rectness of the computations, but in plane geometry Ahmes’s 
figures usually help us. He considers the area of land in the 
forms of square, oblong, isosceles triangle, isosceles trapezoid, 
and circle. Example No. 44 gives 100 as the area of a square 
whose sides are 10. In No. 51 he draws an isosceles triangle 
whose sides are 10 ruths and whose base is 4 ruths, and finds 
the area to be 20. The correct value is 19.6-. Ahmes’s 
approximation is obtained by taking the product of one leg 
and half the base. The same error occurs in the area of 
the isosceles trapezoid. Half the sum of the two bases is 
nultiplied by one leg. His treatment of the circle is an actual 
quadrature, for it teaches how to find a square equivalent to 
the circular area. He takes as the side, the diameter dimin- 
ished by + of itself. This is a fair approximation, for, if the 
radius is taken as unity, then the side of the square is 1,8, and 
its area (1,8)? = 3.1604... Besides these problems there are 
others relating to pyramids and disclosing some knowledge of 
similar figures, of proportion, and, perhaps, of rudimentary 
trigonometry.’ 
Besides the Ahmes papyrus, proofs of the existence of

ancient Egyptian geometry are found in figures on the walls 
of old structures. The wall was ruled with squares, or other 
rectilinear figures, within which coloured pictures were drawn.! 
The Greek philosopher Democritus (about 460-370 B.c.) is 
quoted as saying that “in the construction of plane figures . . . 
no one has yet surpassed me, not even the so-called Harpedo- 
napte of Egypt.” Cantor has pointed out the meaning of the 
word “harpedonaptee” to be “ rope-stretchers.”? This, together 
with other clues, led him to the conclusion that in laying out 
temples the Egyptians determined by accurate astronomical 
observation a north and south line; then they constructed a 
line at right angles to this by means of a rope stretched around 
three pegs in such a way that the three sides of the triangle 
formed are to each other as 3:4:5, and that one of the legs of 
this right triangle coincided with the N. and §. line. Then 
the other leg gave the E. and W. line for the exact orientation 
of the temple. According to a leathern document in the Ber- 
lin Museum, “rope-stretching” occurred at the very early age 
of Amenemhat I. If Cantor’s explanation is correct, it fol- 
lows, therefore, that the Egyptians were familiar with the 
well-known property of the right-triangle, in case of sides in 
the ratio 3:4:5, as early as 2000 B.c. 
From what has been said it follows that Egyptian geometry 
flourished at a very early age. What about its progress in 
subsequent centuries? In 257 3.c. was laid out the temple of 
Horus, at Edfu, in Upper Egypt. About 100 z.c. the number 
of pieces of land owned by the priesthood, and their areas, 
were inscribed upon the walls in hieroglyphics. The incorrect 
formula of Ahmes for the isosceles trapezoid is here applied 
for any trapezium, however irregular. Thus the formule of 
more than 2000 z.c. yield closer approximations than those

written two centuries after Euclid! The conclusion irresist- 
ibly follows that the Egyptians resembled the Chinese in the 
stationary character, not only of their government, but also of 
their science. An explanation of this has been sought in the 
fact that their discoveries in mathematics, as also in medicine, 
were entered at an early time upon their sacred books, and 
that, in after ages, it was considered heretical to modify or 
augment anything therein. Thus the books themselves closed 
the gates to progress. 
Egyptian geometry is mainly, though not entirely, a geome- 
try of areas, for the measurement of figures and of solids con- 
stitutes the main part of it. This practical geometry can 
hardly be called a science. In vain we look for theorems and 
proofs, or for a logical system based on axioms and postulates. 
It is evident that some of the rules were purely empirical. 
If we may trust the testimony of the Greeks, Egyptiar 
geometry had its origin in the surveying of land necessitated 
by the frequent overflow of the Nile. 
GREECE 
About the seventh century B.c. there arose between Greece 
and Egypt a lively intellectual as well as commercial inter- 
course. Just as Americans in our time go to Germany to 
study, so early Greek scholars visited the land of the pyra- 
mids. Thales, (Enopides, Pythagoras, Plato, Democritus, 
Eudoxus, all sat at the feet of the Egyptian priests for in- 
struction. While Greek culture is, therefore, not primitive, 
it commands our enthusiastic admiration. The speculative 
mind of the Greek at once transcended questions pertaining 
merely to the practical wants of everyday life; it pierced 
into the ideal relations of things, and revelled in the study 
 
-P-A-G-E-55
GREECE 4T 
of science as science. For this reason Greek geometry will 
always be admired, notwithstanding its limitations and 
defects. 
Eudemus, a pupil of Aristotle, wrote a history of geometry. 
This history has been lost; but an abstract of it, made by Pro- 
clus in his commentaries on Euclid, is extant, and is the most 
trustworthy information we have regarding early Greek 
geometry. We shall quote the account under the name of 
Eudemian Summary. 
I. The Ionic School. —The study of geometry was introduced 
into Greece by Thales of Miletus (640-546 B.c.), one of the 
“seven wise men.” Commercial pursuits brought him to 
Egypt; intellectual pursuits, for a time, detained him there. 
Plutarch declares that Thales soon excelled the priests, and 
amazed King Amasis by measuring the heights of the pyra- 
mids from their shadows. According to Plutarch this was 
done thus: The length of the shadow of the pyramid is to the 
shadow of a vertical staff, as the unknown height of the pyra- 
mid is to the known length of the staff. But according to 
Diogenes Laertius the measurement was different: The height 
of the pyramid was taken equal to the length of its shadow at 
the moment when the shadow of a vertical staff was equal to 
its own length." 
1 The first method implies a knowledge of the proportionality of the 
sides of equiangular triangles, which some critics are unwilling to grant 
Thales. The rudiments of proportion were certainly known to Ahmes 
and the builders of the pyramids. Allman grants Thales this knowledge, 
and, in general, assigns to him and his school a high rank. See Greek 
Geometry from Thales to Euclid, by Grorcr Jounston ALLMAN, Dublin, 
1889, p. 14. Gow (p. 142) also believes in Plutarch’s narrative, but 
Cantor (I., p. 185) leaves the question open, while Hankel (p. 90), Bret- 
schneider, Tannery, Loria, are inclined to deny Thales a knowledge of 
similitude of figures. See Die Geometrie und die Geometer vor Euklides.

48 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
The Ludemian Summary ascribes to Thales the invention of 
the theorems on the equality of vertical angles, the equality 
of the base angles in isosceles triangles, the bisection of the 
circle by any diameter, and the congruence of two triangles 
having a side and the two adjacent angles equal respectively. 
Famous is his application of the last theorem to the deter- 
mination of the distances of ships from the shore. The 
theorem that all angles inscribed in a semicircle are right 
angles is attributed by some ancients to Thales, by others to 
Pythagoras. Thales thus seems to have originated the geome- 
try of lines and of angles, essentially abstract in character, 
while the Egyptians dealt primarily with the geometry of sur- 
faces and of solids, empirical in character.’ It would seem as 
though the Egyptian priests who cultivated geometry ought at 
least to have felt the truth of the above theorems. We have 
no doubt that they did, but we incline to the opinion that 
Thales, like a true philosopher, formulated into theorems and 
subjected to proof that which others merely felt to be true. 
If this view is correct, then it follows that Thales in his pyra- 
mid and ship measurements was the first to apply theoretical 
geometry to practical uses. Z 
Thales acquired great celebrity by the prediction of a solar 
eclipse in 585 s.c. With him begins the study of scientific 
astronomy. The story goes that once, while viewing the stars, 
he fell into a ditch. An old woman attending him exclaimed, 
“How canst thou know what is doing inthe heavens, when 
thou seest not what is at thy feet?” 
Astronomers of the Ionic school are Anaximander and 
Anaximenes. Anaxagoras, a pupil of the latter, attempted to 
square the circle while he was confined in prison. Approai- 
Scienze Esatte nell’ Antica Grecia, di Gino Loria, in Modena, 1893,

mations to the ratio + occur early among the Egyptians, Baby- 
lonians, and Hebrews; but Anaxagoras is the first recorded as 
attempting the determination of the exact ratio—that knotty 
problem which since his time has been unsuccessfully attacked 
by thousands. Anaxagoras apparently offered no solution. 
Il. The Pythagorean School.—The life of Pythagoras 
(580 ?-500? B.c.) is enveloped in a deep mythical haze. We 
are reasonably certain, however, that he was born in Samos, 
studied in Egypt, and, later, returned to the place of his 
nativity. Perhaps he visited Babylon. Failing in his attempt 
to found a school in Samos, he followed the current of civiliza- 
tion, and settled at Croton in South Italy (Magna Grecia). 
There he founded the Pythagorean brotherhood with observ- 
ances approaching Masonic peculiarity. Its members were 
forbidden to divulge the discoveries and doctrines of their 
school. Hence it is now impossible to tell to whom individu- 
ally the various Pythagorean discoveries must be ascribed. It 
was the custom among the Pythagoreans to refer every dis- 
covery to the great founder of the sect. At first the school 
flourished, but later it became an object of suspicion on account 
of its mystic observances. A political party in Lower Italy 
destroyed the buildings; Pythagoras fled, but was killed at 
Metapontum. Though politics broke up the Pythagorean fra- 
ternity, the school continued to exist for at least two centuries. 
Like Thales, Pythagoras wrote no mathematical treatises. 
The Eudemian Summary says: “Pythagoras changed the study 
of geometry into the form of a liberal education, for he exam- 
ined its principles to the bottom, and investigated its theorems 
in an immaterial and intellectual manner.” 
To Pythagoras himself is to be ascribed the well-known 
property of the right triangle. The truth of the theorem for 
the special case when the sides are 3, 4, and 5, respectively, he 
may have learned from the Egyptians. We are told that Py- 
E
-P-A-G-E-58
  50 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
thagoras was so jubilant over this great discovery that he sac- 
rificed a hecatomb to the muses who inspired him. That this 
is but a legend seems plain from the fact that the Pythagoreans 
believed in the transmigration of the soul, and, for that reason, 
opposed the shedding of blood. In the traditions of the late 
Neo-Pythagoreans the objection is removed by replacing the 
bloody sacrifice by that of “an ox made of flour”! The dem- 
onstration of the law of three squares, given in Euclid, L, 47, 
is due to Euclid himself. The proof given by Pythagoras 
has not been handed down to us. Much ingenuity has been 
expended in conjectures as to its nature. Bretschneider’s sur- 
mise, that the Pythagorean proof was substantially the same 
as the one of Bhaskara (given elsewhere), has been well 
received by Hankel, Allman, Gow, Loria.1 Cantor thinks it 
not improbable that the early proof involved the consideration 
of special cases, of which the isosceles 
right triangle, perhaps the first, may 
have been proved in the manner indi- 
cated by the adjoining figure. The 
four lower triangles together equal the 
four upper. Divisions of squares by their 
diagonals in this fashion occur in Plato’s 
Meno. Since the time of the Greeks the famous Pythagorean 
Theorem has received many different demonstrations.’ 
A characteristic point in the method of Pythagoras and his 
school was the combination of geometry and arithmetic; an

arithmetical fact has its analogue in geometry, and vice versa. 
Thus in connection with the law of three squares Pythagoras 
devised a rule for finding integral numbers representing the 
lengths of the sides of right triangles: Choose 2n +1 as one 
side, then 3[(2n+1)?—1]=2n’?+2n=the other side, and 
2n?+2n+1=the hypotenuse. If n=5, then the three 
sides are 11, 60, 61. This rule yields only triangles whose 
hypotenuse exceeds one of the sides by unity. 
Aseribed to the Pythagoreans is one of the greatest mathe- 
matical discoveries of antiquity —that of Irrational Quantities. 
The discovery is usually supposed to have grown out of the 
study of the isosceles right triangle.! If each of the equal 
legs is taken as unity, then the hypotenuse, being equal 
to V2, cannot be exactly represented by any number what- 
ever. We may imagine that other numbers, say 7 or 4, were 
taken to represent the legs; in these and all other cases experi- 
mented upon, no number could be found to exactly measure the 
length of the hypotenuse. After repeated failures, doubtless, 
“some rare genius, to whom it is granted, during some happy 
moments, to soar with eagle’s flight above the level of human 
thinking, —it may have been Pythagoras himself, — grasped the 
happy thought that this problem cannot be solved.”? As there 
was nothing in the shape of any geometrical figure which could 
suggest to the eye the existence of irrationals, their discovery 
must have resulted from unaided abstract thought. The 
Pythagoreans saw in irrationals a symbol of the unspeakable. 
The one who first divulged their theory is said to have suf- 
fered shipwreck in consequence, “for the unspeakable and 
invisible should always be kept secret.” * 
1 ALLMAN, p. 42, thinks it more likely that the discovery was owing to 
the problem — to cut a line in extreme and mean ratio.

-P-A-G-E-60
52 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
The theory of parallel lines enters into the Pythagorean 
proof of the angle-sum in triangles; a line being drawn parallel 
to the base. In this mode of proof we observe progress from 
the special to the general, for according to Geminus the early 
demonstration (by Thales?) of this theorem embraced three 
different cases: that of equilateral, that of isosceles, and, finally, 
that of scalene triangles.’ 
Eudemus says the Pythagoreans invented the problems con- 
cerning the application of areas, including the cases of defect 
and excess, as in Euclid, VI., 28,29. They could also construct 
a polygon equal in area to a given polygon and similar to 
another. In a general way it may be said that the Pythago- 
rean plane geometry, like the Egyptian, was much concerned 
with areas. Conspicuous is the absence of theorems on the 
circle. ; 
The Pythagoreans demonstrated also that the plane about 
a point is completely filled by six equilateral triangles, four 
squares, or three regular hexagons, so that a plane can be 
divided into figures of either kind. Related to the study 
of regular polygons is that of the regular solids. It is here 
that the Pythagoreans contributed to solid geometry. From 
the equilateral triangle and the square arise the tetraedron, 
octaedron, cube, and icosaedron —all four probably known to 
the Egyptians, certainly the first three. In Pythagorean phi- 
losophy these solids represent, respectively, the four elements 
of the physical world: fire, air, earth, and water. In absence 
of a fifth element, the subsequent discovery of the dodecaedron 
was made to represent the universe itself. The legend goes 
that Hippasus perished at sea because he divulged “the sphere 
with the twelve pentagons.” 
Pythagoras used to say that the most beautiful of all solids 
was the sphere; of all plane figures, the circle.

  GREECE 53 
With what degree of rigour the Italian school demonstrated 
their theorems we have no sure way of determining. We are 
safe, however, in assuming that the progress from empirical to 
reasoned solutions was slow. 
Passing to the later Pythagoreans, we meet the name of 
Philolaus, who wrote a book on Pythagorean doctrines, which 
he made known to the world. Lastly, we mention the brilliant 
Archytas of Tarentum (428-347 B.c.), who was the only great 
geometer in Greece when Plato opened his school. He ad- 
vanced the theory of proportion and wrote on the duplication 
of the cube." 
III. The Sophist School.—The periods of existence of the 
several Greek mathematical “schools” overlap considerably. 
Thus, Pythagorean activity continued during the time of the 
sophists, until the opening of the Platonic school. 
After the repulse of the Persians at the battle of Salamis 
in 480 n.c. and the expulsion of the Phoenicians and pirates 
from the Aigean Sea, Greek commerce began to flourish. Athens 
gained great ascendancy, and became the centre toward which 
scholars gravitated. Pythagoreans flocked thither; Anaxag- 
oras brought to Athens Ionic philosophy. The Pythagorean 
practice of secrecy ceased to be observed; the spirit of Athe- 
nian life demanded publicity.? All menial work being per- 
formed by slaves, the Athenians were people of leisure. That 
they might excel in public discussions on philosophic or scien- 
tific questions, they must be educated. There arose a demand 
for teachers, who were called sophists, or “wise men.” Unlike 
the early Pythagoreans, the sophists accepted pay for their 
teaching. They taught principally rhetoric, but also philoso- 
phy, mathematics, and astronomy. 
The geometry of the circle, neglected by the Pythagoreans, 
was now taken up. The researches of the sophists centre

around the three following famous problems, which were to be 
constructed with aid only of a ruler and a pair of compasses: 
(1) The trisection of any angle or are ; 
(2) The duplication of the cube; i.e. to construct a cube 
whose volume shall be double that of a given cube; 
(8) The squaring of the circle; i.e. to construct a square or 
other rectilinear figure whose area exactly equals the area of a 
given circle. 
Certainly no other problems in mathematics have been stud- 
ied so assiduously and persistently as these. The best Greek 
intellect was bent upon them; Arabic learning was applied to 
them; some of the best mathematicians of the Western Renais- 
sance wrestled with them. Trained minds and untrained minds, 
wise men and cranks, all endeavoured to conquer these prob- 
lems which the best brains of preceding ages had tried but failed 
to solve. At last the fact dawned upon the minds of men that, 
so long as they limited themselves to the postulates laid down 
by the Greeks, these problems did not admit of solution. This 
divination was later confirmed by rigorous proof. The Greeks 
demanded constructions of these problems by ruler and com- 
passes, but no other instruments. In other words, the figure 
was to consist only of straight lines and of circles. A con- 
struction was not geometrical if effected by drawing ellipses, 
parabolas, hyperbolas, or other higher curves. With aid of 
such curves the Greeks themselves resolved all three problems; 
but such solutions were objected to as mechanical, whereby 
“the good of geometry is set aside and destroyed, for we again 
reduce it to the world of sense, instead of elevating and imbu- 
ing it with the eternal and incorporeal images of thought, even 
as it is employed by God, for which reason He always is God” 
(Plato). Why should the Greeks have admitted the circle into 
geometrical constructions, but rejected the ellipse, parabola, 
and the hyperbola —curves of the same order as the circle?
-P-A-G-E-63
GREECE 55 
We answer in the words of Sir Isaac Newton:! “Tt is not the 
simplicity of the equation, but the easiness of the description, 
which is to determine the choice of our lines for the construc- 
tions of problems. For the equation that expresses a parabola 
is more simple than that that expresses a circle, and yet the 
circle, by its more simple construction, is admitted before it.”* 
The bisection of an angle is one of the easiest of geometrical 
constructions. Early investigators, as also beginners in our 
elementary classes, doubtless expected the division of an angle 
into three equal parts to be fully as easy. In the special case 
of a right angle the construction is readily found, but the 
general case offers insuperable difficulties. One Hippias, very 
probably Hippias of Elis (born about 460 B.c.), was among 
the earliest to study this problem. Failing to find a construc- 
tion involving merely circles and straight lines, he discovered 
a transcendental curve (i.e. one which cannot be represented 
by an algebraic equation) by which an angle could be divided 
not only into three, but into any number of equal parts. As 
this same curve was used later in the quadrature of the

2In one of De Morgan’s letters to Sir W. R. Hamilton occurs the fol- 
lowing: ‘* But what distinguishes the straight line and circle more than 
anything else, and properly separates them for the purpose of elementary 
geometry ? Their self-similarity. Every inch off a straight line coincides 
with every other inch, and off a circle with every other off the same 
circle. Where, then, did Euclid fail? In not introducing the third curve, 
which has the same property —the screw. The right line, the circle, the 
screw — the representatives of translation, rotation, and the two combined 
—ought to have been the instruments of geometry. With a screw we 
should never have heard of the impossibility of trisecting an angle, squar- 
ing the circle,’ etc. — Graves, Life of Sir William Rowan Hamilton, 
1889, Vol. III., p. 343. However, if Newton’s test of easiness of descrip- 
tion be applied, then the screw must be excluded.

56 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
The problem “to double the cube” perhaps suggested itselt 
to geometers as an extension to three dimensions of the prob- 
lem in plane geometry, to double a square. If upon the diag- 
onal of a square a new square is constructed, the area of this 
new square is exactly twice the area of the first square. This 
is at once evident from the Pythagorean Theorem. But the 
construction of a cube double in volume to a given cube brought 
to light unlooked-for difficulties. A different origin is assigned 
to this problem by Eratosthenes. The Delians were once suf- 
fering from a pestilence, and were ordered by the oracle to 
double a certain cubical altar. Thoughtless workmen simply 
constructed a cube with edges twice as long; but brainless 
work like that did not pacify the gods. The error being dis- 
covered, Plato was consulted on this “Delian problem.” Era- 
tosthenes tells us a second story: King Minos is represented 
by an old tragic poet as wishing to erect a tomb for his son; 
being dissatisfied with the dimensions proposed by the archi- 
tect, the king exclaimed: “Double it, but fail not in the 
cubical form.” If we trust these stories, then the problem 
originated in an architectural difficulty.’ Hippocrates of Chios 
(about 430 B.c.) was the first to show that this problem can be 
reduced to that of finding between a given line and another 
twice as long, two mean proportionals, i.e. of inserting two 
lengths between the lines, so that the four shall be in geomet- 
trical progression. In modern notation, if a and 2a are the 
two lines, and # and y the mean proportionals, we have the 
progression a, a, y, 2a, which gives aaa oe 3 whence 2?= ay, 
y= 2ax. Then a= a’ = 2a°x, a =2a%. But Hippocrates 
ventor of the quadratrix was Hippias of Elis is denied by Hanxet, p. 151, 
and ALLMAN, p. 94; but affirmed by Canror, L, p. 181; BreTscHNEIDER,

naturally failed to find x, the side of the double cube, by geo- 
metrical construction. However, the reduction of the problem 
in solid geometry to one of plane geometry was in itself no 
mean achievement. He became celebrated also for his success 
in. squaring a lune. This result he attempted to apply to 
the squaring of the circle! In his study of the Delian and 
the quadrature problems Hippocrates contributed much to the 
geometry of the circle. The subject of similar figures, involv- 
ing the theory of proportion, also engaged his attention. He 
wrote a geometrical text-book, called the Elements (now lost), 
whereby, no doubt, he contributed vastly towards the progress 
of geometry by making it more easily accessible to students. 
Hippocrates is said to have once lost all his property. 
Some accounts say he fell’into the hands of pirates, others 
attribute the loss to his own want of tact. Says Aristotle: 
“Tt is well known that persons stupid in one respect are by 
no means so in others. There is nothing strange in this: so 
Hippocrates, though skilled.in geometry, appears to have been 
in other respects weak and stupid; and he lost, as they say, 
through his simplicity, a large sum of money by the fraud of 
the collectors of customs at Byzantium.” * 
A considerable step in advance was the introduction of the 
process of exhaustion by the sophist Antiphon, a contemporary 
of Hippocrates. By inscribing in a circle a square and on its 
sides erecting isosceles triangles with their vertices in the cir- 
cumference, and on the sides of these triangles erecting new 
isosceles triangles, etc., he obtained a succession of regular in- 
scribed polygons of 8, 16, 32, sides, and so on, each polygon 
approaching in area closer to that of the circle than did the 
preceding polygon, until the circle was finally exhausted. Anti-

58 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
phon concluded that a polygon could be thus inscribed, the 
sides of which, on account of their minuteness, would coincide 
with the circumference of the circle. Since squares can be 
found exactly equal in area to any given polygon, there can 
be constructed a square exactly equal in area to the last poly- 
gon inscribed, and therefore equal to the circle itself. Thus 
it appears that he claimed to have established the possi- 
bility of the exact quadrature of the circle. One of his con- 
temporaries, Bryson of Heraclea, modified this process of 
exhaustion by not only inscribing, but also, at the same 
time, circumscribing regular polygons. He did not claim to 
secure coincidence between the polygons and circle, but he 
committed a gross error by assuming the area of the circle to 
be the exact arithmetical mean of the two polygonal areas. 
Antiphon’s attempted quadrature involved a point eagerly 
discussed by philosophers of that time. All other Greek 
geometers, so far as we know, denied the possibility of the 
coincidence of a polygon and a circle, for a straight line can 
never coincide with a circumference or part of it. If a poly- 
gon could coincide with a circle, then, says Simplicius, we 
would have to put aside the notion that magnitudes are divisi- 
ble ad infinitum. We have here a difficult philosophical ques- 
tion, the discussion of which at Athens appears to have 
greatly influenced and modified Greek mathematical thought 
in respect to method. The Eleatic philosophical school, with 
the great dialectician Zeno at its head, argued with admirable 
ingenuity against the infinite divisibility of a line, or other 
magnitude. Zeno’s position was practically taken by Antiphon 
in his assumption that straight and curved lines are ultimately 
reducible to the same indivisible elements.1 Zeno reasoned by 
reductio ad absurdum against the theory of the infinite divisi-

  GREECE 59 
bility of a line. He argued that if this theory is assumed to 
be correct, Achilles could not catch a tortoise. For while he 
ran to the place where the tortoise had been when he started, 
the tortoise crept some distance ahead, and while Achilles 
hastened to that second spot, it again moved forward a little, 
and so on. Being thus obliged first to reach every one of the 
infinitely many places which the tortoise had previously occu- 
pied, Achilles could never overtake the tortoise. But, as a 
matter of fact, Achilles could catch a tortoise, therefore, it is 
wrong to assume that the distance can be divided into an 
indefinite number of parts. In like manner, “ the flying arrow 
is always at rest; for it is at each moment only in one place.” 
These paradoxes involving the infinite divisibility, and there- 
fore the infinite multiplicity of parts no doubt greatly per- 
plexed the mathematicians of the time. Desirous of construct- 
ing an unassailable geometric structure, they banished from 
their science the ideas of the infinitely little and the infinitely 
great. Moreover, to meet other objections of dialecticians, 
theorems evident to the senses (for instance, that two inter- 
secting circles cannot have a common centre) were sub- 
jected to rigorous demonstration. Thus the influence of 
dialecticians like Zeno, themselves not mathematicians, greatly 
modified geometric science in the direction of increased rigour.’ 
The process of exhaustion, adopted by Antiphon and Bryson, 
was developed into the perfectly rigorous method of exhaustion. 
In finding, for example, the ratio between the areas of two 
circles, similar polygons were inscribed and by increasing the 
number of sides, the spaces between the polygons and circles 
nearly exhausted. Since the polygonal areas were to each 
other as the squares of the diameters, geometers doubtless 
divined the theorem attributed to Hippocrates of Chios, that

  60 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
the circles themselves are to each other as the square of their 
diameters. But in order to exclude all vagueness or possibility 
of doubt, later Greek geometers applied reasoning like that in 
Euclid, XII., 2, which we give in condensed form as follows: 
Let C, ¢ be two circular areas; D, d, the diameters. Then, 
if the proportion D?:d?’=C:c is not true, suppose that 
D:@=C:c'. If e'<ce, then a polygon p can be inscribed in 
the circle ¢ which comes nearer to c in area than does c!. If 
P be the corresponding polygon in C, then P:p=D*?:@=C:c', 
and P:C=p:c'.. Since p>c', we have P>C, which is 
absurd. Similarly, c’ cannot exceed c. As c! cannot be larger, 
nor smaller than c¢, it must be equal toc. a.u.p. Here we have 
exemplified the method of exhaustion, involving the process of 
reasoning, designated the reductio ad absurdum. Hankel refers 
this method of exhaustion back to Hippocrates of Chios, but 
the reasons for assigning it to this early writer, rather than 
to Eudoxus, seem insufficient. 
IV. The Platonic School.— After the Peloponnesian War 
(431-404 b.c.), the political power of Athens declined, but her 
leadership in philosophy, literature, and science became all the 
stronger. She brought forth such men as Plato (429 ?-347 B.c.), 
the strength of whose mind has influenced philosophical 
thought of all ages. Socrates, his early teacher, despised 
mathematics. But after the death of Socrates, Plato travelled 
extensively and came in contact with several prominent math- 
ematicians. At Cyrene he studied geometry with Theodorus ; 
in Italy he met the Pythagoreans. Archytas of Tarentum and 
Timzus of Locri became his intimate friends. About 389 z.c. 
Plato returned to Athens, founded a school in the groves of 
the Academia, and devoted the remainder of his life to teach- 
ing and writing. Unlike his master, Socrates, Plato placed

GREECE 61 
great value upon the mind-developing power of mathematics. 
“Let no one who is unacquainted with geometry enter here,” 
was inscribed over the entrance to his school. Likewise Xeno- 
crates, a successor of Plato, as teacher in the Academy, declined 
to admit a pupil without mathematical training, “Depart, for 
thou hast not the grip of philosophy.” The Eudemian Sum- 
mary says of Plato that “he filled his writings with mathe- 
matical terms and illustrations, and exhibited on every occa- 
sion the remarkable connection between mathematics and 
philosophy.” 
Plato was not a professed mathematician. He did little or 
no original work, but he encouraged mathematical study and 
suggested improvements in the logic and methods employed 
in geometry. He turned the instinctive logic of the earlier 
geometers into a method to be used consciously and without 
misgiving.! With him begin careful definitions and the 
consideration of postulates and axioms. ‘The Pythagorean 
definition, “a point is unity in position,” embodying a philo- 
sophical theory, was rejected by the Platonists; a point was 
defined as “the beginning of a straight line” or “an indivisible 
line.” According to Aristotle the following definitions were 
also current: The point, the line, the surface, are respectively 
the boundaries of the line, the surface, and the solid; a solid 
is that which has three dimensions. Aristotle quotes from 
the Platonists the axiom: If equals be taken from equals, the 
remainders are equal. How many of the definitions and axi- 
oms were due to Plato himself we cannot tell. Proclus and 
Diogenes Laertius name Plato as the inventor of the method 
of proof called analysis. To be sure, this method had been 
used unconsciously by Hippocrates and others, but it is gen- 
erally believed that Plato was the one who turned the un-

-P-A-G-E-70
  62 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
conscious logic into a conscious, legitimate method. The 
development and perfection of this method was certainly a 
great achievement, but Allman (p. 125) is more inclined to 
ascribe it to Archytas than to Plato. 
The terms synthesis and analysis in Greek mathematics had 
a different meaning from what they have in modern mathe- 
matics or in logic.' The oldest definition of analysis as op- 
posed to synthesis is given in Euclid, XIII., 5, which was most 
likely framed by Eudoxus:* “Analysis is the obtaining of 
the thing sought by assuming it and so reasoning up to an 
admitted truth; synthesis is the obtaining of the thing sought 
by reasoning up to the inference and proof of it.” * 
Plato gave a powerful stimulus to the study of solid geom- 
etry. The sphere and the regular solids had been studied 
somewhat by the Pythagoreans and Egyptians. The latter,

Jahrhunderten, Tiibingen, 1884, p. 12. 
2 BRETSCHNEIDER, p. 168. 
8 Greek mathematics exhibits different types of analysis. One is the 
reductio ad absurdum, in the method of exhaustion. Suppose we wish 
to prove that ‘‘Ais B.”” We assume that A is not B; then we form a 
synthetic series of conclusions: not Bis C, Cis D, Dis EZ; if now A is 
not E, then it is impossible that A is not B; ie, A is B. Qx.v. Verify 
this process by taking Euclid, XII., 2, given above. Allied to this is the 
theoretic analysis: To prove that A is B assume that A is B, then B is C, 
Cis D, Dis E, Fis F; hence Ais F. If this last is known to be false, 
then Ais not B; if it is known to be true, then the reasoning thus far 
is not conclusive. ‘To remove doubt we must follow the reverse process, 
Ais F, F is E, E is D, D is C, C is B; therefore A is B. This second 
case involves two processes, the analytic followed by the synthetic. The 
only aim of the analytic is to aid in the discovery of the synthetic. Of 
greater importance to the Greeks was the problematic analysis, applied 
in constructions intended to satisfy given conditions.. The construction 
is assumed as accomplished ; then the geometric relations are studied 
with the view of discovering a synthetic solution of the problem. For 
examples of proofs by analysis, consult HanKeL, p. 143; Gow, p. 178;

of course, were more or less familiar with the geometry of 
the pyramid. In the Platonic school, the prism, pyramid, 
cylinder, and cone were investigated. The study of the cone 
led Menechmus to the discovery of the conic sections. Per- 
haps the most brilliant mathematician of this period was 
Eudoxus. He was born at Cnidus about 408 B.c., studied 
under Archytas and, for two months, under Plato, Later he 
taught at Cyzicus. At one time he visited, with his pupils, 
the Platonic school. He died at Cyzicus in 355 3.c. Among 
the pupils of Eudoxus at Cyzicus who afterwards entered the 
academy of Plato were Menechmus, Dinostratus, Athenzus, 
and Helicon. The fame of the Academy is largely due to 
these. The Hudemian Summary says that Eudoxus “first 
increased the number of general theorems, added to the three 
proportions three more, and raised to a considerable quantity 
the learning, begun by Plato, on the subject of the section, to 
which he applied the analytic method.” By this “section” 
is meant, no doubt, the “golden section,” which cuts a line 
in extreme and mean ratio. He proved, says Archimedes, 
that a pyramid is exactly one-third of a prism, and a cone 
one-third of a cylinder, having equal base and altitude. That 
spheres are to each other as the cubes of their radii, was 
probably established by him. The method of ewhaustion 
was used by him extensively and was probably his own in- 
vention.! 
1The Eudemian Summary mentions, besides the geometers already 
named, Theztetus of Athens, to whom Euclid is supposed to be indebted 
in the composition of the 10th book, treating of incommensurables (ALL- 
MAN, pp. 206-215); Leodamas of Thasos ; Neocleides and his pupil Leon, 
who wrote a geometry ; Theudius of Magnesia, who also wrote a geometry 
or Elements ; Hermotimus of Colophon, who discovered many propositions 
in Euclid’s Elements; Amyclas of Heraclea, Cyzicenus of Athens, and 
Philippus of Mende. The pre-Euclidean text-books just mentioned are 
not extant.

  64 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
V. The First Alexandrian School.— During the sixty-six 
years following the Peloponnesian War —a period of political 
decline — Athens brought forth some of the greatest and most 
subtle thinkers of Greek antiquity. In 338 B.c. she was con- 
quered by Philip of Macedon and her power broken forever. 
Soon after, Alexandria was founded by Alexander the Great, 
and it was in this city that literature, philosophy, science, 
and art found a new home. 
In the course of our narrative, we have seen geometry take 
feeble root in Egypt; we have seen it transplanted to the 
Ionian Isles; thence to Lower Italy and to Athens; now, at 
last, grown to substantial and graceful proportions, we see it 
transferred to the land of its origin, and there, newly invigor- 
ated, expand in exuberant growth. 
Perhaps the founder, certainly a central figure, of the Alex- 
andrian mathematical school was Euclid (about 300 z.c.). No 
ancient writer in any branch of knowledge has held such a com- 
manding position in modern education as has Euclid in ele- 
mentary geometry. “The sacred writings excepted, no Greek 
has been so much read or so variously translated as Euclid.” 
After mentioning Eudoxus, Thetetus, and other members 
of the Platonic school, Proclus? adds the following to the Hu- 
demian Summary : 
“Not much later than these is Euclid, who wrote the Ele- 
ments, arranged much of Eudoxus’s work, completed much 
of Thezetetus’s, and brought to irrefragable proof propositions 
which had been less strictly proved by his predecessors. 
Euclid lived during the reign of the first Ptolemy, for he is 
quoted by Archimedes in his first book; and it is said, more- 
over, that Ptolemy once asked him, whether in geometric mat-

ters there was not a shorter path than through his Elements, 
to which he replied that there was no royal road to geometry. 
He is, therefore, younger than the pupils of Plato, but older 
than Eratosthenes and Archimedes, for these are contempora- 
ries, as Eratosthenes informs us. He belonged to the Platonic 
sect and was familiar with Platonic philosophy, so much so, in 
fact, that he set forth the final aim of his work on the Elements 
to be the construction of the so-called Platonic figures (regular 
solids).”? Pleasing are the remarks of Pappus,* who says he 
was gentle and amiable to all those who could in the least 
degree advance mathematical science. Stobzeus* tells the fol- 
lowing story : “A youth who had begun to read geometry with 
Euclid, when he had learned the first proposition, inquired, 
‘What do I get by learning those things?’ So Euclid called 
his slave and said, ‘Give him threepence, since he must gain 
out of what he learns.’” 
Not much more than what. is given in these extracts do we 
know concerning the life of Euclid. All other statements 
about him are trivial, of doubtful authority, or clearly 
erroneous.° 
1“ This piece of wit has had many imitators. ‘Quel diable,’ said a 
French nobleman to Rohault, his teacher in geometry, ‘ pourrait entendre 
cela?’ to which the answer was, ‘Ce serait un diable qui aurait de la 
patience.’ A story similar to that of Euclid is related by Seneca (Ep. 91, 
cited by August) of Alexander.’? Dr Moreay, op. cit.

principal editions of Euclid, see Lorra, II., pp. 10, 11, 17,18. During

  66 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
Though the author of several works on mathematics and 
physics, the fame of Euclid has at all times rested mainly upon 
his book on geometry, called the Elements. This book was so 
far superior to the Elements written by Hippocrates, Leon, and 
Theudius, that the latter works soon perished in the struggle 
for existence. The great réle that it has played in geometric 
teaching during all subsequent centuries, as also its strong and 
weak points, viewed in the light of pedagogical science and of 
modern geometrical discoveries, will be discussed more fully 
later. At present we confine ourselves to a brief critical 
account of its contents. 
Exactly how much of the Elements is original with Euclid, 
we have no means of ascertaining. Positive we are that certain 
early editors of the Elements were wrong in their view that 
a finished and unassailable system of geometry sprang at once 
from the brain of Euclid, “an armed Minerva from the head 
of Jupiter.” Historical research has shown that Euclid got 
the larger part of his material from the eminent mathema- 
ticians who preceded him. In fact, the proof of the “Theorem 
of Pythagoras” is the only one directly ascribed to him. 
Allman! conjectures that the substance of Books I., IL., IV. 
comes from the Pythagoreans, that the substance of Book VI. 
is due to the Pythagoreans and Eudoxus, the latter contribut- 
ing the doctrine of proportion as applicable to incommensu- 
rables and also the Method of Exhaustions (Book XII.), that 
Theetetus contributed much toward Books X. and XIIL, that 
the principal part of the original work of Euclid himself is to 
GAN, op. cit.: ‘‘In the frontispiece to Whiston’s translation of Tacquet’s 
Euclid there is a bust, which is said to be taken from a brass coin in pos- 
session of Christina of Sweden ; but no such coin appears in the published 
collection of those in the cabinet of the queen of Sweden. Sidonius Apol- 
linaris says (£pist. XI., 9) that it was the custom to paint Euclid with 
the fingers extended (laxatis), as if in the act of measurement.”

be found in Book X. The greatest achievement of Euclid, no 
doubt, was the co-ordinating and systematizing of the material 
handed down to him. He deserves to be ranked as one of the 
greatest systematizers of all time. 
The contents of the Elements may be briefly indicated as 
follows: Books I., II., III., IV., VI. treat of plane geometry ; 
Book V., of the theory of proportion applicable to magnitudes 
in general; Books VII., VIII., IX., of arithmetic; Book X., of 
the arithmetical characteristics of divisions of straight lines 
(ie. of irrationals); Books XI., XII., of solid geometry ; Books 
XIIL, XIV., XV., of the regular solids. The last two books 
are apocryphal, and are supposed to have been written by 
Hypsicles and Damascius, respectively.’ 
Difference of opinion long existed regarding the merits of the 
Elements as a scientific treatise. Some regarded it as a work 
whose logic is in every detail perfect and unassailable, while 
others pronounced it to be “riddled with fallacies.”? In our 
opinion, neither view is correct. That the text of the Elements 
is not free from faults is evident to any one who reads the com- 
mentators on Euclid. Perhaps no one ever surpassed Robert 
Simson in admiration for the great Alexandrian. Yet Sim- 
son’s “notes” to the text disclose numerous defects. While 
Simson is certainly wrong in attributing to blundering editors 
all the defects which he noticed in the Elements, early editors 
are doubtless responsible for many of them. Most of the 
emendations pertain to points of minor importance. The 
work as a whole possesses a high standard of accuracy. A 
minute examination of the text has disclosed to commentators 
1 See Gow, p. 272; Canror, I., pp. 358, 501. Book XV., in the opinion

due to Damascius. See Lorta, II., pp. 88-92.

an occasional lack of extreme precision in the statement of 
what is assumed without proof, for truths are treated as 
self-evident which are not found in the list of postulates. 
Again, Euclid sometimes assumes what might be proved; as 
when in the very definitions he asserts that the diameter of a 
circle bisects the figure,? which might be readily proved from 
the axioms. He defines a plane angle as the “inclination of 
two straight lines to one another, which meet together, but are 
not in the same straight line,” but leaves the idea of angle 
magnitude somewhat indefinite by his failure to give a test for 
equality of two angles or to state what constitutes the sum or 
difference of two angles.- Sometimes Euclid fails to consider 
or give all the special cases necessary for the full and complete 
proof of a theorem.* Such instances of defects which friendly 
critics have found in the Elements show that Euclid is not 
infallible.’ But in noticing these faults, we must not lose

arguing that spherics are ruled out by the postulate, ‘‘ Two straight lines

sight of the general excellence of the work as a scientific 
treatise —an excellence which in 1877 was fittingly recog- 
nized by a committee of the British Association for the 
Advancement of Science (comprising some of England’s ablest 
mathematicians) in their report that “no text-book that has 
yet been produced is fit to succeed Euclid in the position of 
authority.”! As already remarked, some editors of the Elements, 
particularly Robert Simson, wrote on the supposition that the 
original Euclid was perfect, and any defects in the text as 
known to them, they attributed to corruptions. For example, 
Simson thinks there should be a definition of compound ratio 
at the beginning of the fifth book ; so he inserts one and assures 
us that it is the very definition given by Euclid. Not a single 
manuscript, however, supports him.. The text of the Elements 
now commonly used is Theon’s. Simson was inclined to make 
him the scapegoat for all defects which he thought he discoy- 
ered in Euclid. But a copy of the Elements sent with other 
manuscripts from the Vatican to Paris by Napoleon I. is 
believed to be anterior to Theon’s recension; this differs but 
slightly from Theon’s version, showing that the faults are 
probably Euclid’s own. 
At the beginning of our modern translations of the Elements 
(Robert Simson’s or Todhunter’s, for example), under the head 
of definitions are given the assumptions of such notions as the 
point, line, etc., and some verbal explanations. Then follow 
three postulates or demands, (1) that a line may be drawn from 
any point to any other, (2) that a line may be indefinitely pro- 
duced, (3) that a circle may be drawn with any radius and any 
point as centre. After these come twelve axioms.2 The term 
the postulate was omitted by Euclid and supplied by some commentator.

axiom was used hy Proclus, but not by Euclid. He speaks 
instead of “common notions ” — common either to all men or to 
all sciences. The first nine “axioms” relate to all kinds of mag- 
nitudes (things equal to the same thing are equal to each other, 
etc., the whole is greater than its part),’ while the last three 
(two straight lines cannot enclose a space; all right angles are 
equal to one another; the parallel-axiom) relate to space only. 
While in nearly all but the most recent of modern editions 
of Euclid the geometric “axioms” are placed in the same 
category with the other nine, it is certainly true that Euclid 
sharply distinguished between the two classes. An immense 
preponderance of manuscripts places the “axioms” relating to 
space among the postulates.? This is their proper place, for 
modern research has shown that they are assumptions and 
not common notions or axioms. It is not known who first 
made the unfortunate change. In this respect there should 
Euclid, viz. the four on inequalities and the one, ‘‘ two straight lines can- 
not enclose a space.’’ Thus Hxipere and Menes, in their Latin and 
Greek edition of 1883, omit all five. See also Ence, and SricxKe., 
p. 8, note. 
1“ That the whole is greater than its part is not an axiom, as that emi- 
nently bad reasoner, Euclid, made it to be.... Of finite collections it is true, 
of infinite collections false.” — C. S. Peirce, Monist, July, 1892, p. 539. 
Peirce gives illustrations in which, for infinite collections, the ‘‘ axiom”? is 
untrue. Nevertheless, we are unwilling to admit that the assuming of 
this axiom proves Euclid a bad reasoner. Euclid had nothing whatever 
to do with infinite collections. As for finite collections, it would seem 
that nothing can be more axiomatic. ‘To infinite collections the terms 
great and small are inapplicable. On this point see Grore Cantor, 
“Ueber eine Eigenschaft des Inbegriffes reeller algebraischer Zahlen,” 
Crelle Journal, 77, 1873 ; or for a more elementary discussion, see Friix

be a speedy return to Euclid’s practice. The parallel-postu- 
late plays a very important rdle in the history of geometry.’ 
Most modern authorities hold that Euclid missed one of the 
postulates, that of rigidity (or else that of equal variation), 
which demands that figures may be moved about in space 
without any alteration in form or magnitude (or that all mov- 
ing figures change equally and each fills the same space when 
brought back to its original position).? The rigidity postulate 
is given in recent geometries, but a contradictory of it, stated 
above (the postulate of equal variation) would likewise admit 
figures to be compared by the method of superposition, and 
“everything would go on quite as well” (Clifford). Of the 
two, the former is the simpler postulate and is, moreover, in 
accordance with what we conceive to be our every-day experi- 
ence. G. B. Halsted contends that Euclid did not miss the 
rigidity assumption and is justified in not making it, since he 
covers it by his assumption 8: “Magnitudes which can be 
made to coincide with one another are equal to one another.” 
In the first book, Euclid only once imagines figures to be 
moved relatively to each other, namely, in proving proposi- 
1 The parallel-postulate is: ‘‘If a straight line meet two straight lines, 
so as to make the two interior angles on the same side of it taken to- 
gether less than two right angles, these straight lines, being continually 
produced, shall at length meet on that side on which are the angles which 
are less than two right angles.’? In the various editions of Euclid, different 
numbers are assigned to the ‘‘axioms.’’ Thus, the parallel-postulate is 
in old manuscripts the 5th postulate. This place is also assigned to it by 
F, Peyrarp (who was the first to critically compare the various MSS.) 
in his edition of Euclid in French and Latin, 1814, and by Hersere and 
Mence in their excellent annotated edition of Euclid’s works, in Greek 
and Latin, Leipzig, 1883. Clavius calls it the 13th axiom; Robert Sim- 
son, the 12th axiom; others (Bolyai for instance), the 11th axiom.

tion 4: two triangles are equal if two sides and the included 
angle are equal respectively. To bring the triangles into coin- 
cidence, one triangle may have to be turned over, but Euclid 
is silent on this point. “Can it have escaped his notice that 
in plane geometry there is an essential difference between 
motion of translation and reversion ?”? 
Book V., on proportions of magnitudes, has been greatly 
admired because of its rigour of treatment.? Beginners find 
the book difficult. It has been the chief battle-ground of dis- 
cussion regarding the fitness of the Elements as a text-book 
for beginners.

wonderful book of all. Euclid investigates every possible 
variety of lines which can be represented by \vat vb, 
a and b representing two commensurable lines, and obtains 25 
species. Every individual of every species is incommensu- 
rable with all the individuals of every other species. De 
Morgan was enthusiastic in his admiration of this book.*

connection with this subject of irrationals a remark by Dedekind is of 
interest. See RicHarp DEDEKIND, Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen, 
Braunschweig, 1888, pp. xii and xiii. He points out that all Euclid’s 
constructions of figures could be made, even if the plane were not con- 
tinuous ; that is, even if certain points in the plane were imagined to be 
punched out, so as to give it the appearance of a sieve. All the points 
in Euclid’s constructions would lie between the holes; no point of the 
constructions would fall into a hole. The explanation of all this is to be 
sought in the fact that Euclid deals with certain algebraic irrationals, to 
the exclusion of the transcendental.

GREECE 73 
The main differences in subject-matter between the Elements 
and our modern school geometries consist in this: the modern 
works pay less attention to the “Platonic figures,” but add 
theorems on triangles and quadrilaterals inscribed in or cir- 
cumscribed about a circle, on the centre of gravity of the tri- 
angle, on spherical triangles (in general, the geometry of a 
spherical surface), and, perhaps, on some of the more recent 
discoveries pertaining to the geometry of the plane triangle 
and circle. 
The main difference as to method, between Euclid and his 
modern rivals, lies in the treatment of proportion and the 
development of size-relations. His geometric theory of pro- 
portion enables him to study these relations without reference 
to mensuration. The Elements and all Greek geometry before 
Archimedes eschew mensuration. The theorem that the area 
of a triangle equals half the product of its base and its altitude, 
or that the area of a circle equals z times the square of the 
radius, is foreign to Euclid. In fact he nowhere finds an 
approximation to the ratio between the circumference and 
diameter. Another difference is that Euclid, unlike the great 
majority of modern writers, never draws a line or constructs a 
figure until he has actually shown the possibility of such con- 
struction with aid only of the first three of his postulates 
or of some previous construction. The first three propositions 
of Book I. are not theorems, but problems, (1) to describe an 
equilateral triangle, (2) from a given point to draw a straight 
line equal to a given straight line, (3) from the greater of two 
straight lines to cut off a part equal to the less. It is only by 
the use of hypothetical figures that modern books can relegate 
all constructions to the end of chapters. For instance, an 
angle is imagined to be bisected, before the possibility and 
method of bisecting it has been shown. One of the most 
startling examples of hypothetical constructions is the division  
-P-A-G-E-82
  74 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
of a circumference into any desired number of equal parts, 
given in a modern text-book. This appears all the more star- 
tling, when we remember that one of the discoveries which 
make the name of Gauss immortal is the theorem that, besides 
regular polygons of 2", 3, 5 sides (and combinations therefrom), 
only polygons whose number of sides is a prime number larger 
than five, and of the form p= 2” +1, can be inscribed in a 
circle with aid of Euclid’s postulates, i.e. with aid of ruler and 
compasses only.’ Is the absence of hypothetical constructions 
commendable? If the aim is rigour, we answer emphatically, 
Yes. If the aim is adherence to recognized pedagogical prin- 
ciples, then we answer, in a general way, that, in the transition 
from the concrete to the more abstract geometry, it often seems 
desirable to let facts of obser tion take the place of abstruse 
processes of reasoning. Even. :lid resorts to observation for 
the fact that his two circles in I 1 cut each other. Reasoning 
too difficult to be grasped does not develop the mind.? More- 
over, the beginner, like the ancient Epicureans, takes no interest 
in trains of reasoning which prove to him what he has long 
known; geometrical reasoning is more apt to interest him 
when it discloses new facts. Thus, pedagogics may reasona- 
bly demand some concessions from demonstrative rigour. 
Of the other works of Euclid we mention only the Data, 
probably intended for students who had completed the Ele- 
ments and wanted drill in solving new problems; a lost work 
on Fallacies, containing exercises in detecting fallacies; a 
treatise on Porisms, also lost, but restored by Robert Simson 
and Michel Chasles.

2 The Epicureans, says Proclus, blamed Euclid for proving some things 
which were evident without proof. Thus, they derided I., 20 (two sides 
of a triangle are greater than the third) as being manifest even to asses.

The period in which Euclid flourished was the golden era in 
Greek mathematical history. This era brought forth the two 
most original mathematicians of antiquity, Archimedes and 
Apollonius of Perga. They rank among the greatest mathe- 
maticians of all time. Only a small part of their discoveries 
can be described here. 
Archimedes (287 ?-212 B.c.) was born at Syracuse in Sicily. 
Cicero tells us he was of low birth. He visited Egypt and, 
perhaps, studied in Alexandria; then returned to his native 
place, where he made himself useful to his admiring friend and 
patron, King Hieron, by applying his extraordinary inventive 
powers to the construction of war-engines, by which he inflicted 
great loss on the Romans, who, 1 :der Marcellus, were besieging 
the city. That by the use of irrors reflecting the sun’s rays 
he set on fire the Roman sh 3, when they came within bow- 
shot of the walls, is probably 4 fiction. Syracuse was taken at 
length by the Romans, and Archimedes died in the indiscrim- 
inate slaughter which followed. The story goes that, at the 
time, he was studying some geometrical diagram drawn in the 
sand. Toan approaching Roman soldier he called out, “ Don’t 
spoil my circles,” but the soldier, feeling insulted, killed him. 
The Roman general Marcellus, who admired his genius, raised 
in his honour a tomb bearing the figure of a sphere inscribed in 
acylinder. The Sicilians neglected the memory of Archimedes, 
for when Cicero visited Syracuse, he found the tomb buried 
under rubbish. 
While admired by his fellow-citizens mainly for his mechan- 
ical inventions, he himself prized more highly his discoveries 
in pure science. 
Of special interest to us is his book on the Measurement of 
the Circle.’ He proves first that the circular area is equal to

1880-81. Fox a fuller account of his Measurement of the Circle, see

  76 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
that of a right triangle having the length of the circumference 
for its base and the radius for its altitude. To find this base 
is the next task. He first finds an upper limit for the ratio of 
the circumference to the diameter. After constructing an equi- 
lateral triangle with its vertex in the centre of the circle and 
its base tangent to the circle, he bisects the angle at the centre 
and determines the ratio of the base to the altitude of one of 
the resulting right triangles, taking the irrational square root 
a little too small. Next, the central angle of this right triangle 
is bisected and the ratio of its legs determined. Then the cen- 
tral angle of this last right triangle is bisected and the ratio of 
its legs computed. This bisecting and computing is carried on 
four times, the irrational square roots being taken every time 
a little too small. The ratio of the last two legs considered 
is > 4673}: 153. But the shorter of the legs having this ratio 
is the side of a regular circumscribed polygon. This leads him 
to the conclusion that the ratio of the circumference to the 
diameter is < 31. Next, he finds a lower limit by inscribing 
regular polygons of 6, 12, 24, 48, 96 sides, finding for each suc- 
cessive polygon its perimeter. In this way he arrives at the 
lower limit 349. Hence the final result, 34 >> 3}2, an 
approximation accurate enough for most purposes. 
Worth noting is the fact that while approximations to x were 
made before this time by the Egyptians, no sign of such com- 
putations occur in Euclid and his Greek predecessors. Why 
this strange omission? Perhaps because Greek ideality ex- 
cluded all calculation from geometry, lest this noble science 
lose its rigour and be degraded to the level of geodesy or sur- 
veying. Aristotle says that truths pertaining to geometrical 
magnitudes cannot be proved by anything so foreign to geom- .

etry as arithmetic. The real reason, perhaps, may be found 
in the contention by some ancient critics that it is not evident 
that a straight line can be equal in length to a curved line; in 
particular that a straight line exists which is equal in length 
to the circumference. This involves a real difficulty in geomet- 
rical reasoning. Euclid bases the equality between lines or 
between areas on congruence. Now, since no curved line, or 
even a part of a curved line, can be made to ewactly coincide 
with a straight line or even a part of a straight line, no com- 
parisons of length between a curved line and a straight line 
can be made. So, in Euclid, we nowhere find it given that a 
curved line is equal to a straight line. The method employed 
in Greek geometry truly excludes such comparisons ; according 
to Duhamel, the more modern idea of a limit is needed to logi- 
cally establish the possibility of such comparisons.’ On Euclid- 
ean assumptions it cannot even be proved that the perimeter 
of a circumscribed (inscribed) polygon is greater (smaller) than 
the circumference. Some writers tacitly resort to observation ; 
they can see that it is so. 
Archimedes went a step further and assumed not only this, 
but, trusting to his intuitions, tacitly made the further assump- 
tion that a straight line exists which equals the circumference 
in length. On this new basis he made a valued contribution to 
geometry. No doubt we have here an instance of the usual ~ 
course in scientific progress. Epoch-making discoveries, at 
their birth, are not usually supported on every side by unyield- 
ing logic; on the contrary, intuitive insight guides the seeker 
over difficult places. As further examples of this we instance 
the discoveries of Newton in mathematics and of Maxwell in 
physics. The complete chain of reasoning by which the truth 
of a discovery is established is usually put together at a later 
period.

   78 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
Is not the same course of advancement observable in the 
individual mind? We first arrive at truths without fully 
grasping the reasons for them. Nor is it always best that 
the young mind should, from the start, make the effort to 
grasp them all. In geometrical teaching, where the reasoning 
is too hard to be mastered, if observation can conveniently 
assist, accept its results. A student cannot wait until he has 
mastered limits and the calculus, before accepting the truth 
that the circumference is greater than the perimeter of an 
inscribed polygon. 
Of all his discoveries Archimedes prized most highly those 
in his book on the Sphere and Cylinder. In this he uses the 
celebrated statement, “the straight line is the shortest path 
between two points,” but he does not offer this as a formal 
definition of a straight line.’ Archimedes proves the new 
theorems that the surface of a sphere is equal to four times 
a great circle; that the surface of a segment of a sphere is 
equal to a circle whose radius is the straight line drawn from 
the vertex of the segment to the circumference of its basal 
circle; that the volume and the surface of a sphere are 3 of 
the volume and surface, respectively, of the cylinder circum- 
scribed about the sphere. The wish of Archimedes, that the 
figure for the last proposition be inscribed upon his tomb, was 
carried out by the Roman general Marcellus. 
Archimedes further advanced solid geometry by adding to 
the five “Platonic figures,” thirteen semi-regular solids, each 
bounded by regular polygons, but not all of the same kind. 
To elementary geometry belong also his fifteen Lemmas.* 
Of the “Great Geometer,” Apollonius of Perga, who flour- 
ished about forty years after Archimedes, and investigated 
the properties of the conic sections, we mention, besides his

celebrated work on Conics, only a lost work on Contacts, 
which Vieta and others attempted to restore from certain 
lemmas given by Pappus. It contained the solution of the 
celebrated “Apollonian Problem”: Given three circles, to 
find a fourth which shall touch the three. Even in modern 
times this problem has given stimulus toward perfecting geo- 
metric methods." 
With Euclid, Archimedes, and Apollonius, the eras of Greek 
geometric discovery reach their culmination. But little is 
known of the history of geometry from the time of Apollonius 
to the beginning of the Christian era. In this interval falls 
Zenodorus, who wrote on Figures of Equal Periphery. This 
book is lost, but fourteen propositions of it are preserved by 
Pappus and also by Theon. Here are three of them: “The 
circle has a greater area than any polygon of equal periphery,” 
“Of polygons of the same number of sides and of equal 
periphery the regular is the greatest,” “Of all solids having 
surfaces equal in area, the sphere has the greatest volume.” 
Between 200 and 100 z.c. lived Hypsicles, the supposed author 
of the fourteenth book in Euclid’s Elements. His treatise on 
Risings is the earliest Greek work giving the division of the 
circle into 360 degrees after the manner of the Babylonians. 
Hipparchus of Nicea in Bithynia, the author of the famous 
theory of epicycles and eccentrics, is the greatest astronomer 
of antiquity. Theon of Alexandria tells us that he originated 
the science of trigonometry and calculated a “ table of chords” 
in twelve books (not extant). Hipparchus took astronomical 
observations between 161 and 126 B.c. 
A writer whose tone is very different from that of the great 
writers of the First Alexandrian School was Heron of Alexan-

dria, also called Heron the Elder.'’ As he was a practical 
surveyor, it is not surprising to find little resemblance between 
his writings and those of Euclid or Apollonius. 
Heron was a pupil of Ctesibius, who was celebrated for his 
mechanical inventions, such as the hydraulic organ, water-clock, 
and catapult. It is believed by some that Heron was a son 
of Ctesibius. Heron’s invention of the eolipile and a curious 
mechanism, known as “Heron’s Fountain,” display talent of 
the same order as that of his master. Great uncertainty exists 
regarding his writings. Most authorities believe him to be 
the author of a work, entitled Dioptra, of which three quite 
dissimilar manuscripts are extant. Marie* thinks that the 
Dioptra is the work of a writer of the seventh or eighth cen- 
tury A.p., called Heron the Younger. But we have no reliable 
evidence that a second mathematician by the name of Heron 
really existed.® A reason adduced by Marie for the later 
origin of the Dioptra is the fact that it is the first work which 
* contains the important formula for the area of a triangle, ex- 
pressed in terms of the three sides. Now, not a single Greek 
writer cites this formula; hence he thinks it improbable that 
the Dioptra was written as early as the time of Heron the 
Elder. This argument is not convincing, for the reason that 
only a small part of Greek mathematical literature of this 
period has been preserved. The formula, sometimes called 
“Heronic formula,” expresses the triangular area as follows:

is exceedingly ingenious and discloses no little mathematical 
ability.’ 
“Dioptra,” says Venturi, “were instruments resembling our 
modern theodolites. The instrument consisted of a rod four 
yards long with little plates at the ends for aiming. This 
rested upon a circular disc. The rod could be moved horizon- 
tally and also vertically. By turning the rod around until 
stopped by two suitably located pins on the circular dise, the 
surveyor could work off a line perpendicular to a given direc- 
tion. The level and plumb-line were used.”? Heron explains 
with aid of these instruments and of geometry a large num- 
ber of problems, such as to find the distance between two 
points of which one only is accessible, or between two points 
which are visible, but both inaccessible; from a given point to 
run a perpendicular to a line which cannot be approached ; 
to find the difference of level between two points; to measure 
the area of a field without entering it. 
The Dioptra discloses considerable mathematical ability and 
familiarity with the writings of the authors of the classical 
period.. Heron had read Hipparchus and he wrote a commen- 
tary on Euclid.* Nevertheless the character of his geometry 
is not Grecian, but Egyptian. Usually he gives directions and 
rules, without proofs. He gives formule for computing the 
area of a regular polygon from the square of one of its sides; 
this implies a knowledge of trigonometry. Some of Heron’s 
formule point to an old Egyptian origin. Thus, besides the 
formula for a triangular area, given above, he gives aoe x 5 
which bears a striking likeness to the formula Ute y oes

for finding the area of a quadrangle, found in the Edfu inserip- 
tions. There are points of resemblance between Heron and 
Ahmes. Thus, Ahmes used unit-fractions exclusively ; Heron 
used them oftener than other fractions. That the arithmetical 
theories of Ahmes were not forgotten at this time is also 
demonstrated by the Akhmim papyrus, which, though the 
oldest extant text-book on practical Greek arithmetic, was 
probably written after Heron’s time. Like Ahmes and the 
priests at Edfu, Heron divides complicated figures into simpler 
ones by drawing auxiliary lines; like them he displays par- 
ticular fondness for the isosceles trapezoid. 
The writings of Heron satisfied a practical want, and for 
that reason were widely read. We find traces of them in 
Rome, in the Occident during the Middle Ages, and even in 
India. 
VI. The Second Alexandrian School. — With the absorption 
of Egypt into the Roman Empire and with the spread of 
Christianity, Alexandria became a great commercial as well as 
intellectual centre. Traders of all nations met in her crowded 
streets, while in her magnificent library, museums, and lecture- 
rooms, scholars from the East mingled with those of the West. 
Greek thinkers began to study the Oriental literature and 
philosophy. The resulting fusion of Greek and Oriental 
philosophy led to Neo-Pythagoreanism and Neo-Platonism. 
The study of Platonism and Pythagorean mysticism led to a 
revival of the theory of numbers. This subject became again 
a favourite study, though geometry still held an important 
place. This second Alexandrian school, beginning with the 
Christian era, was made famous by the names of Diophan- 
tus, Claudius Ptolemeus, Pappus, Theon of Smyrna, Theon 
of Alexandria, Iamblichus, Porphyrius, Serenus of Antincia, 
Menelaus, and others.

two astronomical observations taken by him and recorded in 
the Almagest.' Valuable contributions were made by him to 
spherical geometry, in his work, Spherica, which is extant in 
Hebrew and Arabic, but lost in the original Greek. He gives 
the theorems on the congruence of spherical triangles and de- 
scribes their properties in much the same way as Euclid treats 
plane triangles. He gives the theorems that the sum of the 
three sides of a spherical triangle is less than a great circle, 
and that the sum of three angles exceeds two right angles. 
Celebrated are two theorems of his on plane and spherical tri- 
angles. The one on plane triangles is that “if the three sides 
be cut by a straight line, the product of the one set of three 
segments which have no common extremity is equal to the prod- 
uct of the other three.” The illustrious Lazare Carnot makes 
this proposition, known as the “lemma of Menelaus,” the base 
of his theory of transversals.? The corresponding theorem for 
spherical triangles, the so-called “rule of six quantities,” is 
obtained from the above by reading “chords of three segments 
doubled,” in place of “three segments.” 
Another fundamental theorem in modern geometry (in the 
theory of harmonics) is the following ascribed to Serenus of 
Antineia: If from D we draw DF, cutting the triangle ABC, 
and choose H on it, so that DZ: DF = HE: HF, and if we 
draw the line AH, then every transversal through D, such as

etrie. Aus dem Franzisischen tibertragen durch Dr. L. A. SouncKe, 
Halle, 1839, Note VI., pp. 295-299. Hereafter we quote this work as 
Cuastes. A recent French edition of this important work is now easily 
obtainable. Chasles points out that the ‘‘lemma of Menelaus’’ was well 
known during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, but from that 
time, for over a century, it was fruitless and hardly known, until finally 
Carnot began his researches. Carnot, as well as Ceva, rediscovered the 
theorem.

DG, will be divided by AH so that DK: DG =JK:J@. As 
Antineia (or Antinoupolis) in Egypt was founded by Emperor 
Hadrian in 122 a.p., we have 
an upper limit for the date 
of Serenus.1 The fact that 
:p he is quoted by a writer of 
the fifth or sixth century sup- 
plies us with a lower limit. 
A central position in the history of ancient astronomy is 
oceupied by Claudius Ptolemeus. Nothing is known of his 
personal history except that he was a native of Egypt and 
flourished in Alexandria in 139 a.p. The chief of his works 
are the Syntawis Mathematica (or the Almagest, as the Arabs 
called it) and the Geographica. This is not the place to de- 
scribe the “ Ptolemaic System”; we mention Ptolemeus because 
of the geometry and especially the trigonometry contained in 
the Almagest. He divides the circle into. 360 degrees; the 
diameter into 120 divisions, each of these into 60 parts, which 
are again divided into 60 smaller parts. In Latin, these parts    Cc 
were called partes minute prime and partes minute secunde.” 
Hence our names “minutes” and “seconds.” Thus the Baby- 
lonian sexagesimal system, known to Geminus and Hipparchus, 
had by this time taken firm root among the Greeks in Egypt. 
The foundation of trigonometry had been laid by the illustrious 
Hipparchus. Ptolemzus imparted to it a remarkably perfect 
form. He calculated a table of chords by a method which 
seems original with him. After proving the proposition, now 
appended to Euclid, VI. (D), that “the rectangle contained by 
the diagonals of a quadrilateral figure inscribed in a circle is 
equal to both the rectangles contained by its opposite sides,” 
he shows how to find from the chords of two ares the chords of 
1J. L. Heisere in Bibliotheca Mathematica, 1894, p. 97. 
2 Canror, L., p. 416.
-P-A-G-E-93
  GREECE 85 
their sum and difference, and from the chord of any arc that 
of its half. These theorems, to which he gives pretty proofs,’ 
are applied to the calculation of chords. It goes without say- 
ing that the nomenclature and notation (so far as he had any) 
were entirely different from those of modern trigonometry. In 
place of our “sine,” he considers the “ chord of double the are.” 
Thus, in his table, the chord 21-21-12 is given for the are 
20° 30’. Reducing the sexagesimals to decimals, we get for the 
chord .35588. Its half, .17794, is seen to be the sine of 10° 15’, 
or the half of 20° 30'. 
More complete than in plane trigonometry is the theoretical 
exposition of propositions in spherical trigonometry.” Ptolemy 
starts out with the theorems of Menelaus. The fact that 
trigonometry was cultivated not for its own sake, but to aid 
astronomical inquiry, explains the rather startling fact that 
spherical trigonometry came to exist in a developed state 
earlier than plane trigonometry. 
Of particular interest to us is a proof which, wubondiue to 
Proclus, was given by Ptolemy to Euclid’s parallel-postulate. 
The critical part of the proof is as follows: If the straight 
lines are parallel, the interior angles [on the same side of the 
transversal] are necessarily equal to_ 
two right angles. For a, yy are not 
less parallel than £8, 75 and, there- 
fore, whatever the sum of the angles 
B&n, &n3, whether greater or less than 
two right angles, such also must be 
the sum of the angles af, fyy. But the sum of the four 
cannot be more than four right angles, because they are two 
pairs of adjacent angles. The untenable point in this proof

86 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
is the assertion that, in case of parallelism, the sum of the 
interior angles on one side of the transversal must be the same 
as their sum on the other side of the transversal. Ptolemy 
appears to be the first of a long line of geometers who dur- 
ing eighteen centuries vainly attempted to prove the parallel- 
postulate, until finally the genius of Lobatchewsky and Bolyai 
dispelled the haze which obstructed the vision of mathemati- 
cians and led them to see with unmistakable clearness the 
reason why such proofs have been and always will be futile. 
For 150 years after Ptolemy, there appeared no geometer 
of note. An unimportant work, entitled Cestes, by Sextus 
Julius Africanus, applies geometry to the art of war. Pappus 
(about 300 or 370, A.p.) was the last great mathematician of 
the Alexandrian school. Though inferior in genius to Archi- 
medes, Apollonius, and Euclid, who wrote five centuries earlier, 
Pappus towers above his contemporaries as does a lofty peak 
above the surrounding plains. Of his several works the Mathe- 
matical Collections is the only one extant. It was in eight 
books; the first and parts of the second are now missing. The 
object of this treatise appears to have been to supply geometers 
with a succinct analysis of the most difficult mathematical 
works and to facilitate the study of these by explanatory 
lemmas. It is invaluable to us on account of the rich 
information it gives on various treatises by the foremost 
Greek mathematicians, which are now lost. Scholars of the 
last century considered it possible to restore lost’ works from 
the résumé given by Pappus alone. Some of the theorems 
are doubtless original with Pappus, but here it is difficult to 
speak with certainty, for in three instances Pappus copied 
theorems without crediting them to the authors, and he may 
have done the same in other cases where we have no means of 
ascertaining the real discoverer. 
Of elementary propositions of special interest and probably

his own, we mention the following: (1) The centre of inertia 
(gravity) of a triangle is that of another triangle whose vertices 
lie upon the sides of the first and divide its three sides in 
the same ratio; (2) solution of the problem to draw through 
three points lying in the same straight line, three straight 
lines which shall form a triangle inscribed in a given circle ;* 
(3) he propounded the theory of involution of points; (4) the 
line connecting the opposite extremities of parallel diameters 
of two externally tangent circles passes through the point of 
contact (a theorem suggesting the consideration of centres 
of similitude of two circles); (5) solution of the problem, to 
find a parallelogram whose sides are in a fixed ratio to those of 
a given parallelogram, while the areas of the two are in another 
fixed ratio. This resembles somewhat an indeterminate prob- 
lem given by Heron, to construct two rectangles in which the 
sums of their sides, as well as their areas, are in given ratios.” 
It remains for us to name a few more mathematicians. 
Theon of Alexandria brought out an edition of Euclid’s Ele- 
ments, with notes; his commentary on the Almagest is valuable 
on account of the historical notes and the specimens of Greek 
arithmetic found therein. Theon’s daughter Hypatia, a woman 
renowned for her beauty and modesty, was the last Alexandrian 
teacher of reputation. Her notes on Diophantus and Apollo- 
nius have been lost. Her tragic death in 415 a.p. is vividly 
described in Kingsley’s Hypatia.® 
From now on Christian theology absorbed men’s thoughts.

become celebrated, partly by its difficulty, partly by the names of geom- 
eters who solved it, and especially by the solution, as general as it was 
simple, given by a boy of 16, Ottaiano of Naples.’ Cuasuxs, p. 41;

  88 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
In Alexandria Paganism disappeared and with it Pagan learn- 
ing. The Neo-Platonic school at Athens struggled a century 
longer. Proclus, Isidorus, and others endeavoured to keep up 
“the golden chain of Platonic succession.” Proclus wrote a 
commentary on Euclid; that on the first book is extant and is 
of great historical value. A pupil of Isidorus, Damascius of 
Damascus (about 510 a.p.) is believed by some to be the 
author of Book XV. of Euclid’s Elements. 
The geometers of the last 500 years, with the possible 
exception of Pappus, lack creative power; they are commenta- 
tors rather than originators. 
The salient features of Greek geometry are: 
(1) A wonderful clearness and definiteness of concepts, 
and an exceptional logical rigour of conclusions. We have 
encountered occasional flaws in reasoning; but when we com- 
pare Greek geometry in its most complete form with the best 
that the Babylonians, Egyptians, Romans, Hindus, or the 
geometers of the Middle Ages have brought forth, then it 
must be admitted that not only in rigour of presentation, but 
also in fertility of invention, the geometric mind of the Greek 
towers above all others in solitary grandeur. 
(2) A complete absence of general principles and methods. 
For example, the Greeks possessed no general method of 
drawing tangents. In the demonstration of a theorem, there 
were, for the ancient geometers, as many different cases re- 
quiring separate proof as there were different positions for the 
lines.' “It is one of the greatest advantages of the more 
modern geometry over the ancient that through the considera- 
tion of positive and negative quantities it embraces in one 
expression the several cases which a theorem can present in 
respect to the various relative positions of the separate parts

of the figure. Thus to-day the nine main problems and the 
numerous special cases, which are the subject-matter of 83 
theorems in the two books de sectione determinata (of Pappus), 
constitute only one problem which can be solved by one single 
equation.”? “If we compare a mathematical problem with 
a huge rock, into’the interior of which we desire to penetrate, 
then the work of the Greek mathematicians appears to us 
like that of a vigorous stonecutter who, with chisel and ham- 
mer, begins with indefatigable perseverance, from without, to 
crumble the rock slowly into fragments; the modern mathe- 
matician appears like an excellent miner, who first bores 
through the rock some few passages, from which he then 
bursts it into pieces with one powerful blast, and brings to 
light the treasures within.” * : 
ROME 
/ Although the Romans excelled in the science of government 
and war, in philosophy, poetry, and art they were mere imita- 
tors. In mathematics they did not even rise to the desire for 
imitation. If we except the period of decadence, during 
which the reading of Euclid began, we can say that the classical 
Greek writers on geometry were wholly unknown in Rome. 
A science of geometry with definitions, postulates, axioms, 
rigorous proofs, did not exist there) A practical geometry, 
like the old Egyptian, with empirical rules applicable in sur- 
veying, stood in place of the Greek science. Practical treatises 
prepared by Roman surveyors, called agrimensores or gromatici, 
have come down to us. “As regards the geometrical part of

these pandects, which treat exhaustively also of the juristic 
and purely technical side of the art, it is difficult to say 
whether the crudeness of presentation, or the paucity and 
faultiness of the contents more strongly repels the reader. 
The presentation is beneath the notice of criticism, the termi- 
nology vacillating; of definitions and axioms"or proofs of the 
prescribed rules there is no mention. The rules are not formu- 
lated; the reader is left to abstract them from numerical 
examples obscurely and inaccurately described. The total 
impression is as though the Roman gromatici were thousands 
of years older than Greek geometry, and as though the deluge 
were lying between the two.”! ‘Some of their rules were 
probably inherited from the Etruscans, but others are identi- 
cal with those of Heron. Among the latter is that for finding 
the area of a triangle from its sides [the “Heronic formula ”] 
and the approximate formula, 42a’, for the area of equilateral 
triangles (a being one of the sides). But the latter area was 
also calculated by the formulas }(a?+ a) and 4a, the first of 
which was unknown to Heron. Probably }a? was derived 
from an Egyptian formula. The more elegant and refined 
methods of Heron were unknown to the Romans. The grom- 
atici considered it sometimes sufficiently accurate to determine 
the areas of cities irregularly laid out, simply by measuring 
their circumferences.? Egyptian geometry, or as much of it 
as the Romans thought they could use, was imported at the 
time of Julius Caesar, who ordered a survey of the whole 
empire to secure an equitable mode of taxation. From early 
times it was the Roman practice to divide land into rectan- 
gular and rectilinear parts. Walls and streets were parallel, 
enclosing squares of prescribed dimensions. This practice

simplified matters immensely and greatly reduced the neces- 
sary amount of geometrical knowledge. Approximate formule 
answered all ordinary demands of precision. 
Cesar reformed the calendar, and for this undertaking drew 
from Egyptian learning. The Alexandrian astronomer Sosi- 
genes was enlisted for this task. Among Roman names identi- 
fied with geometry or surveying, are the following: Marcus 
Terentius Varro (about 116-27 8.c.), Seatus Julius Frontinus (in 
70 a.p. pretor in Rome), Martianus Mineus Felix Capella 
(born at Carthage in the early part of the fifth century), 
Magnus Aurelius Cassiodorius (born about 475 a.p.). Vastly 
superior to any of these were the Greek geometers belonging 
to the period of decadence of Greek learning. 
It is a remarkable fact that the period of political humilia- 
tion, marked by the fall of the Western Roman Empire and 
the ascendancy of the Ostrogoths, is the period during which 
the study of Greek science began in Italy. The compila- 
tions made at this time are deficient, yet interesting from the 
fact that, down to the twelfth century, they were the only 
sources of mathematical knowledge in the Occident. Fore- 
most among these writers is Anicius Manlius Severinus 
Boethius (480?-524). At first a favourite of King Theod- 
oric, he was later charged with treason, imprisoned, and 
finally decapitated. While in prison he wrote On the Con- 
solations of Philosophy. Boethius wrote an Institutio Arith- 
metica (essentially a translation of the arithmetic of Nico- 
machus) and a Geometry. The first book of his Geometry is 
an extract from the first three books of Euclid’s Elements, 
with the proofs omitted. It appears that Boethius and a num- 
ber of other writers after him were somehow led to the belief 
that the theorems alone belonged to Euclid, while the proofs 
were interpolated by Theon; hence the strange omission of all 
demonstration. The second book in the Geometry of Boethius  
-P-A-G-E-100
  92 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
consists of an abstract of the practical geometry of Frontinus, 
the most accomplished of the gromatici. 
Notice that, imitating Nicomachus, Boethius divides the 
mathematical sciences into four sections, Arithmetic, Music, 
Geometry, Astronomy. He first designated them by the word 
quadruvium (four path-ways). This term was used extensively 
during the Middle Ages. Cassiodorius used a similar figure, 
the four gates of science. Isidorus of Carthage (born 570), in 
his Origines, groups all sciences as seven, the four embraced 
by the guadruvium and three (Grammar, Rhetoric, Logic) 
which constitute the trivium (three path-ways).

  MIDDLE AGES 
  ARITHMETIC AND ALGEBRA 
Hindus 
Soon after the decadence of Greek mathematical research, 
another Aryan race, the Hindus, began to display brilliant 
mathematical power. Not in the field of geometry, but of 
arithmetic and algebra, they achieved glory. In geometry 
they were even weaker than were the Greeks in algebra. The 
subject of indeterminate analysis (not within the scope of this 
history) was conspicuously advanced by them, but on this 
point they exerted no influence on European investigators, 
for the reason that their researches did not become known 
in the Occident until the nineteenth century. 
India had no professed mathematicians ; the writers we are 
about to discuss considered themselves astronomers. To them, 
mathematics was. merely a handmaiden to astronomy. In 
view of this it is curious to observe that the auxiliary 
science is after all the only one in which they won real dis- 
tinction, while in their pet pursuit of astronomy they displayed 
an inaptitude to observe, to collect facts, and to make inductive 
investigations. 
It is an unpleasant feature about the Hindu mathematical 
treatises handed down to us that rules and results are expressed 
in verse and clothed in obscure mystic language. To him who 
93
-P-A-G-E-102
  94 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
already understands the subject such verses may aid the 
memory, but to the uninitiated they are often unintelligible. 
Usually proofs are not preserved, though Hindu mathemati- 
cians doubtless reasoned out all or most of their discoveries. 
It is certain that portions of Hindu mathematics are of 
Greek origin. An interesting but difficult task is the tracing 
of the relation between Hindu and Greek thought. After 
Egypt had become a Roman province, extensive commercial 
relations sprang up with Alexandria. Doubtless there was 
considerable interchange of philosophic and scientific know- 
ledge. The Hindus were indebted to Heron, Diophantus and 
Ptolemy. They were borrowers also from the Chinese. 
At present we know very little of the growth of Hindu 
mathematics. The few works handed down to us exhibit the 
science in its complete state only. The dates of all important 
works but the first are well fixed. In 1881 there was found 
at Bakhshali, in northwest India, buried in the earth, an 
anonymous arithmetic, supposed, from the peculiarities of its 
verses, to date from the third or fourth century after Christ. 
The document that was found is of birch bark and is an in- 
complete copy, prepared probably about the eighth century, 
of an older manuscript.? 
The earliest Hindu astronomer known to us is Aryabhatta, 
born in 476 a.p., at Pataliputra, on the upper Ganges. He 
is the author of the celebrated work, entitled Aryabhattiyam, 
the third chapter of which is given to mathematics.? About 
one hundred years later flourished Brahmagupta, born 598, who 
in 628 wrote his Brahma-sphuta-siddhanta (“ The revised system 
of Brahma”), of which the twelfth and eighteenth chapters

belong to mathematics.!| Important is an elementary work by 
Mahavira (9th century ?); then come, Qridhara, who wrote a 
Ganita-sara (“Quintessence of Calculation”), and Padmanabha, 
the author of an algebra. The science seems to have made 
but little progress since Brahmagupta, for a work entitled 
Siddhantaciromani (“Diadem of an Astronomical System”), 
written by Bhaskara Acarya in 1150, stands little higher than 
Brahmagupta’s Siddhanta, written over five hundred years 
earlier. The two most important mathematical chapters in 
Bhaskara’s work are the Lilavati (“the beautiful,” @e. the 
noble science), and Viga-ganita (“root-extraction”), devoted to 
arithmetic and algebra. From this time the spirit of research 
was extinguished and no great names appear. 
Elsewhere we have spoken of the Hindu’s clever use of the 
principle of local value and of the zero in arithmetical nota- 
tion. We now give an account of Hindu methods of computa- 
tion, which were elaborated in India to a perfection undreamed 
of by earlier nations. The information handed down to our 
time is derived partly from the Hindu works, but mainly from 
an arithmetic written by a Greek monk, Maximus Planudes, 
who lived in the first half of the fourteenth century, and who 
avowedly used Hindu sources. 
To understand the reason why certain modes of computation 
were adopted, we must bear in mind the instruments at the 
disposal of the Hindus in their written calculations. They

celebrated Sanskrit scholar translated also the mathematical chapters of 
the Siddhantaciromani of Bhaskara. Colebrooke held a judicial office in 
India, and about the year 1794 entered upon the study of Sanskrit, that 
he might read Hindu law-books. From youth fond of mathematics, he 
also began to study Hindu astronomy and mathematics; and, finally, by 
his translations, demonstrated to Europe the fact that the Hindus in 
previous centuries had made remarkable discoveries, some of which had 
been wrongly ascribed to the Arabs.

wrote “ with a cane pen upon a small blackboard with a white, 
thinly-liquid paint which made marks that could be easily 
erased, or upon a white tablet, less than a foot square, strewn 
with red flour, on which they wrote the figures with a small 
stick, so that the figures appeared white on a red ground.”? 
To be legible the figures had to be quite large, hence it became 
necessary to devise schemes for the saving of space. This 
was accomplished by erasing a digit as soon as it had done 
its service. The Hindus were generally inclined to follow the 
motion from left to right, as in writing. Thus in adding 254 
and 663, they would say 2+6=8, 54+6=11, which changes 
8 t09,4+3=7. Hence the sum 917. 
In subtraction, they had two methods when “borrowing ” 
became necessary. Thus, in 51 — 28, they would say 8 from 
11=3, 2 from 4=2; or they would say 8 from 11=3, 3 
from 5 = 2. 
In multiplication several methods were in vogue. Sometimes 
/ they resolved the multiplier into its factors, and then multi- 
plied in succession by each factor. At other times they would 
resolve the multiplier into the sum or the difference of two 
numbers which were easier multipliers. In written work, a 
multiplication, such as 5 x 57893411, was done thus: 5x5=25, 
which was written down above the multiplicand; 5 x 7=35; 
adding 3 to 25 gives 28; erase the 5 and in its place write 8. 
We thus have 285. Then, 5x 8=40; 4+5=9; replace 5 
by 9, and we have 2890, etc. At the close of the operation the 
work on the tablet appeared somewhat as follows: 
289467055 
57893411 5 
When the multiplier consisted of several digits, then the 
Hindu operation, as described by Hankel (p. 188), in case of

324 x 758, was as follows: Place the left-hand digit of the 
9259 multiplier, 324, over units’ place in the multiplicand; 
324 3x 7=21, write this down; 3 x 5=15; replace 21 
753 py 22; 3x8=9. At this stage the appearance of 
the work is as here indicated. Next, the multiplicand is 
moved one place to the right. 2x 7=14; in the place where 
the 14 belongs we already have 25, the two together give 39, 
24096 which is written in place of 25; 2x 5=10; add 10 
324 to 399, and write 409 in place of 399; 2x3=6. 
73 The adjoining figure shows the work at this stage. 
We begin the third step by again moving the multiplicand to 
the right one place; 4 x 7= 28; add this to 09 and write 
down 37 in its place, ete. 
243972 This method, employed by Hindus even at the pres- 
324 ent time, economizes space remarkably well, since only 
753 4 few of all the digits used appear on the tablet at any 
one moment. It was, therefore, well adapted to their small 
tablets and coarse pencils. The method is a poor one, if the 
calculation is to be done on paper, (1) because we cannot 
readily and neatly erase the digits, and (2) because, having 
plenty of paper, it is folly to save space and thereby un- 
necessarily complicate the process by performing the addition 
of each partial product, as soon as formed. Nevertheless, we 
find that the early Arabic writers, unable to improve on the 
Hindu process, adopted it and showed how it can be carried 
out on paper, viz., by crossing out the digits (instead of eras- 
ing them) and placing the new digits above the old ones.’ 
Besides these, the Hindus had other methods, more closely 
resembling the processes in vogue at the present time. Thus 
a tablet was divided into squares like a chess-board. Diagonals 
were drawn. The multiplication of 12 x 735 = 8820 is ex- /

hibited in the adjoining diagram.' The manuscripts extant 
give no detailed information regarding the 
Hindu process of division. It seems that 
NANZ3/45! the partial products were deducted by 
2|} tis y | erasing digits in the dividend and replac- 
ing them by the new ones resulting from 
the subtraction. The above scheme of 
multiplication was known to the Arabs and may not be of 
‘Tindu origin. 
The Hindus used an ingenious process (not of Indian 
origin) for testing the correctness of their computations. It 
rests on the theorem that the sum of the digits of a number, 
divided by 9, gives the same remainder as does the number 
itself, divided by 9. The process of “casting out the 9’s” was 
more serviceable to the Hindus than it is to us. Their custom 
of erasing digits and writing others in their places made it 
much more difficult for them to verify their results by review- 
ing the operations performed. At the close of a multiplication 
a large number of the digits arising during the process were 
erased. Hence a test which did not call for the examination 
of the intermediate processes was of service to them. § ~—~—

knowledge of the processes of computation is presupposed. 
In fractions, the numerator is written above the denominator 
without a dividing line. Integers are written as fractions 
with the denominator 1. In mixed expressions the integral

part is written above the fraction. Thus,1=14. In place

quantity is swnya, and is designated thus + by a heavy 
dot. The word sunya means “empty,” and is the word for 
zero, which is here likewise represented by a dot. This double 
use of the word and dot rested upon the idea that a position 
is “empty” if not filled out. It is also to be considered 
“empty” so long as the number to be placed there has not 
been ascertained.* 
The Bakhshali arithmetic contains problems of which some 
are solved by reduction to unity or by a sort of false position. 
Exampue: B gives twice as much as A, C three times as much 
as B,D four times as much as C; together they give 132; 
how much did A give? Take 1 for the unknown (sunya), 
then A=1, B=2, C=6, D= 24, their sum = 33. Divide 
132 by 33, and the quotient 4 is what A gave. 
The method of false position we have encountered before 
among the early Egyptians. With them it was an instinctive 
procedure; with the Hindus it had risen to a conscious method. 
Bhaskara uses it, but while the Bakhshali document preferably 
assumes 1 as the unknown, Bhaskara is partial to 3. Thus, 
if a certain number is taken five-fold, 4 of the product be 
subtracted, the remainder divided by 10, and 4, 3, and 4 of the 
original number added, then 68 is obtained. What is the num- 
ber? Choose 3, then you get 15, 10,1,and14+%+3+$=42 
Then (68 + 12) 3 = 48, the answer.’ 
A favourite method of solution is that of inversion. With 
laconic brevity, Aryabhatta describes it thus: “Multiplica- 
tion becomes division, division becomes multiplication; what 
was gain becomes loss, what loss, gain; inversion.” Quite 
different from this in style is the following problem of 
Aryabhatta, which illustrates the method: “Beautiful maiden 
with beaming eyes, tell me, as thou understandst the right

method of inversion, which is the number which multiplied by 
3, then increased by 3 of the product, divided by 7, diminished 
by 4 of the quotient, multiplied by itself, diminished by 52, by 
extraction of the square root, addition of 8, and division by 10, 
gives the number 2?” The process consists in beginning with 
2 and working backwards. Thus, (2-10 —8)?+52=196, 
V196 = 14, and 14.3.7-4+38=28, the answer.’ Here is 
another example taken from the Lilavati: “The square root 
of half the number of bees in a swarm has flown out upon a 
jessamine-bush, § of the whole swarm has remained behind; 
one female bee flies about a male that is buzzing within a lotus- 
flower into which he was allured in the night by its sweet 
odour, but is now imprisoned in it. Tell me the number of 
bees.”? Answer 72. The pleasing poetic garb in which arith- 
metical problems are clothed is due to the Hindu practice of 
writing all school-books in verse, and especially to the fact 
that these problems, propounded as puzzles, were a favourite 
social amusement. Says Brahmagupta: “These problems are 
proposed simply for pleasure; the wise man can invent a 
thousand others, or he can solve the problems of others by the 
rules given here. As the sun eclipses the stars by his brilliancy, 
so the man of knowledge will eclipse the fame of others in 
assemblies of the people if he proposes algebraic problems, and 
still more if he solves them.” 
The Hindus were familiar with the Rule of Three, with ne 
computation of interest (simple and compound), with alliga- 
tion, with the fountain or pipe problems, and with the sum- 
mation of arithmetic and geometric series. Aryabhatta 
applies the Rule of Three to the problem—a 16 year old 
girl slave costs 32 nishkas, what costs one 20 years old? —and 
says that it is treated by inverse proportion, since “the value

of living creatures (slaves and cattle) is regulated by their 
age,” the older being the cheaper.t The extraction of square 
and cube roots was familiar to the Hindus. This was done 
with aid of the formulas 
(a+b =a?+2ab+0°; (a+b) =a + 30% +3 ab? + B. 
The Hindus made remarkable contributions fo Algebra. 
Addition was indicated simply by juxtaposition as in Dio- 
phantine algebra; subtraction, by placing a dot over the 
subtrahend; multiplication, by putting after the factors, bha, 
the abbreviation of the word bhavita, “the product”’; division, 
by placing the divisor beneath the dividend; square root, by 
writing ka, from the word karana (irrational), before the 
quantity. The unknown quantity was called by Brahmagupta 
ydvattdvat. In case of several unknown quantities, he gave, 
unlike Diophantus, a distinct name and symbol to each. Un- 
known quantities after the first were assigned the names of 
colours, being called the black, blue, yellow, red, or green 
unknown. The initial syllable of each word was selected as 
the symbol for the unknown. Thus yd meant x; kd (from 
kdlaka = black) meant y; yd kd bha, “a times y”; ka15ka10, 
“V/15 —-V10.” 
The Hindus were the first to recognize the existence of 
absolutely negative numbers and of irrational numbers. The 
difference between + and — numbers was brought out by 
attaching to the one the idea of “assets,” to the other that 
of “debts,” or by letting them indicate opposite directions. 
A great step beyond Diophantus was the recognition of two 
answers for quadratic equations. Thus Bhaskara gives «= 50 
or —5 for the roots of #®—452= 250. “But,” says he, “the 
second value is in this case not to be taken, for it is inadequate ;

102 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
people do not approve of negative roots.” Thus negative roots 
were seen, but not admitted. In the Hindu mode of solving 
quadratic equations, as found in Brahmagupta and Aryabhatta, 
it is believed that Greek processes are discernible. For 
example, in their works, as also in Heron of Alexandria, 
ax? + ba =c is solved by a rule yielding 
b\? _b 
Ne +(5) 3 =- ele eae 
a 
This rule is improved by Qridhara, who begins by multiplying 
the members of the equation, not by a as did his predecessors, 
but by 4a, whereby the possibility of fractions under the 
radical sign is excluded. He gets 
poe Via +0 =). 
2a 
The most important advance in the theory of affected quadratic 
equations made in India is the unifying under one rule of the 
three cases 
av +be=c, bu+c=ax’, ax’+c= ba. 
In Diophantus these cases seem to have been dealt with sepa- 
rately, because he was less accustomed to deal with negative 
quantities.? 
An advance far beyond the Greeks and even beyond 
Brahmagupta is the statement of Bhaskara that “the square 
of a positive, as also of a negative number, is positive; that 
the square root of a positive number is twofold, positive and 
negative. There is no square root of a negative number, for 
it is not a square.” 
We have seen that the Greeks sharply discriminated between 
numbers and magnitudes, that the irrational was not recognized

by them as a number. The discovery of the existence of 
irrationals was one of their profoundest achievements. To 
the Hindus this distinction between the rational and irrational 
did not occur; at any rate, it was not heeded. They passed 
from one to the other, unmindful of the deep gulf separating 
the continuous from the discontinuous. Irrationals were sub- 
jected to the same processes as ordinary numbers and were 
indeed regarded by them as numbers. By so doing they 
greatly aided the progress of mathematics; for they accepted 
results arrived at intuitively, which by severely logical 
processes would call for much greater effort. Says Hankel 
(p. 195), “if one understands by algebra the application of 
arithmetical operations to complex magnitudes of all sorts, 
whether rational or irrational numbers or space-magnitudes, 
then the learned Brahmins of Hindostan are the real inventors 
of algebra.” 
In Bhaskara we find two remarkable identities, one of which 
is given in nearly all our school algebras, as showing how to 
find the square root of a “binomial surd.” What Euclid in 
Book X. embodied in abstract language, difficult of compre- 
hension, is here expressed to the eye in algebraic form and 
applied to numbers :?

in the course of ten years fused by the furnace blast of 
religious enthusiasm into a powerful nation, which, in one 
century, extended its dominions from India across northern 
Africa to Spain. A hundred years after this grand march of 
conquest, we see them assume the leadership of intellectual 
pursuits; the Moslems became the great scholars of their 
time. ; 
(About 150 years after Mohammed’s flight from Mecca to 
Medina, the study of Hindu science was taken up at Bagdad 
in the court of Caliph Almansur. In 773 a.p. there appeared 
at his court a Hindu astronomer with astronomical tables which 
by royal order were translated into Arabic. These tables, 
known by the Arabs as the Sindhind, and probably taken from 
the Siddhdnta of Brahmagupta, stood in great authority. 
With these tables probably came the Hindu numerals. Except 
for the travels of Albirfini, we. possess no other evidence of 
intercourse between Hindu and Arabic scholars ;) yet we should 
not be surprised if future historical research should reveal 
greater intimacy. Better informed are we as to the Arabic 
acquisition of Greek learning. Elsewhere we shall speak of 
geometry and trigonometry. Aba’l Wafa (940-998) translated 
the treatise on algebra by Diophantus, one of the last of 
the Greek authors to be brought out in Arabic. Euclid, Apol- 
lonius, and Ptolemzeus had been acquired by the Arabic schol- 
ars at Bagdad nearly two centuries earlier. 
Of all Arabic arithmetics known to us, first in time and 
first in historical importance is that of Muhammed ibn Masa 
Alchwarizmi who lived during the reign of Caliph Al Mamfin 
(813-833). Like all Arabic mathematicians whom we shall 
name, he was first of all an astronomer; with the Arabs as with 
the Hindus, mathematical pursuits were secondary. Alchwa- 
rizmi’s arithmetic was supposed to be lost, but in 1857 a 
Latin translation of it, made probably by Athelard of Bath,
-P-A-G-E-113
  ARABS 105 
was found in the library of the University of Cambridge. The 
arithmetic begins with the words, “Spoken has Algoritmi. Let 
us give deserved praise to God, our leader and defender.” Here 
the name of the author, Alchwarizmi, has passed into Algoritmi, 
whence comes our modern word algorithm, signifying the art of 
computing in any particular way. Alchwarizmi is familiar 
with the principle of local value and Hindu processes of calcu- 
lation. According to an Arabic writer, his arithmetic “ excels 
all others in brevity and easiness, and exhibits the Hindu intel- 
lect and sagacity in the grandest inventions.” ? Both in addition 
and subtraction Alehwarizmi proceeds from left to right, but in 
subtraction, strange to say, he fails to explain the case when 
a larger digit is to be taken from a smaller. His multiplication 
is one of the Hindu processes, modified for working on paper: 
each partial product is written over the corresponding digit in 
the multiplicand; digits are not erased as with the Hindus, but 
are crossed out. The process of division rests on the same 
idea. The divisor is written below the dividend, the quotient 
136 @bove it. The changes in the dividend resulting from 
24 the subtraction of the partial products are written 
110 above the quotient. For every new step in the divi- 
oe sion, the divisor is moved to the right one place. The 
143 author gives a lengthy description of the process in 
46468 case of 46468 + 324 = 143188, which is represented by 
824 Cantor® by the adjoining model solution. This proc- 
oe 4 ess of division was used almost exclusively by early 
European writers who followed Arabic models, and it

was not extinct in Europe in the eighteenth century.! Later 
Arabic authors modified Alchwarizmi’s process and thereby 
approached nearer to those now prevalent. Alchwarizmi 
explains in detail the use of sexagesimal fractions. 
Arabic arithmetics usually explained, besides the four cardi- 
nal operations, the process of “casting out the 9’s” (called 
sometimes the “Hindu proof”), the rule of “false position,” 
the rule of “double position,” square and cube root, and frac- 
tions (written without the fractional line, as by the Hindus). 
The Rule of Three oceurs in Arabic works, sometimes in their 
algebras. It is a remarkable fact that among the early Arabs 
no trace whatever of the use of the abacus can be discovered. 
At the close of the thirteenth century, for the first time, we 
find an Arabic writer, [dn Albannd, who uses processes which 
are a mixture of abacal and Hindu computation. Ibn Albanna 
lived in Bugia, an African seaport, and it is plain that he came 
under European influences and thence got a knowledge of the 
abacus.” ‘ 
It is noticeable that in course of time, both in arithmetic 
and algebra, the Arabs in the East departed further and 
further from Hindu teachings and came more thoroughly under 
the influence of Greek science. This is to be deplored, for on 
these subjects the Hindus had new ideas, and by rejecting 
them the Arabs barred against themselves the road of prog- 
ress. Thus, Al Karcht of Bagdad, who lived in the beginning 
of the eleventh century, wrote an arithmetic in which Hindu 
numerals are excluded! All numbers in the text are written 
out fully in words.) \In other. respects the work is modelled 
almost entirely after Greek patterns. Another prominent and

able writer, Abd’! Wafd, in the second half of the tenth cen- 
tury, wrote an arithmetic in which Hindu numerals find no 
place. The question why Hindu numerals are ignored by 
authors so eminent, is certainly a puzzle. Cantor suggests that 
at one time there may have been rival schools, of which one 
followed almost exclusively Greek mathematics, the other 
Indian:? 
The algebra of Alchwarizmi is the first work in which the 
word “algebra” occurs. The title of the treatise is aldschebr 
walmukdbala. These two words mean “restoration and oppo- 
sition.” By “restoration” was meant the transposing of neg- 
ative terms to the other side of the equation; by “opposi- 
tion,” the discarding from both sides of the equation of like 
terms so that, after this operation, such terms appear only on 
that side of the equation on which they were in excess. Thus, 
5a?—2x%=6+432* passes by aldschebr into 5a°=6+42a 
+32; and this, by walmukabala into 2a?=6+422. When 
Alchwarizmi’s aldschebr walmukdbala was translated into 
Latin, the Arabic title was retained, but the second word was 
gradually discarded, the first word remaining in the form of 
algebra. Such is the origin of this word, as revealed by the 
study of manuscripts. Several popular etymologies of the 
word, unsupported by manuscript evidence, used to be current. 
For instance, “algebra” was at one time derived from the 
name of the Arabic scholar, Dschdbir ibn Aflah, of Seville, 
who was called Geber by the Latins. But Geber lived two 
centuries after Alchwarizmi, and therefore two centuries after 
the first appearance of the word.” 
Alchwarizmi’s algebra, like his arithmetic, contains nothing

original. It explains the elementary operations and the solu. 
tion of linear and quadratic equations. Whence did the 
author receive his knowledge of algebra? That he got it 
solely from Hindu sources is impossible, for the Hindus had 
no such rules as those of “restoration” and “opposition” ; 
they were not in the habit of making all terms in an equa- 
tion positive as is done by “restoration.” Alchwarizmi’s 
tules resemble somewhat those of Diophantus. But we can- 
not conclude that our Arabic author drew entirely from 
Greek sources, for, unlike Diophantus, but like the Hindus, he 
recognized two roots to a quadratic and accepted irrational 
solutions. It would seem, therefore, that the aldschebr wal- 
mukdbala was neither purely Greek nor purely Hindu, but was 
a hybrid of the two, with the Greek element predominating. 
In one respect this and other Arabic algebras are inferior to 
both the Hindu and the Diophantine models: the Eastern 
Arabs use no symbols whatever. With respect to notation, 
algebras have been divided into three classes:' (1) Rhetorical 
Algebras, in which no symbols are used, everything being 
written out in words. Under this head belong Arabic works 
(excepting those of the later Western Arabs), the Greek works 
of Iamblichus and Thymaridas, and the works of the early 
Italian writers and of Regiomontanus. The equation a +10 
= 39 was indicated by Alchwarizmi as follows: “A square 
and ten of its roots are equal to thirty-nine dirhem; that is, if 
you add to a square ten roots, then this together equals thirty- 
nine.” 
(2) Syncopated Algebras, in which, as in the first class, every- 
thing is written out in words, except that the abbreviations are 
used for certain frequently recurring operations and ideas. 
Such are the works of Diophantus, those of the later Western

ARABS 109 
Arabs, and of the later European writers down to about the 
middle of the seventeenth century (excepting Vieta’s). As 
an illustration we take a sentence from Diophantus, in which, 
for the sake of clearness, we shall use the Hindu numerals 
and, in place of the Greek symbols, the corresponding English 
abbreviations. If S., N., U., m. stand for “square,” “num- 
ber,” “unity,” “minus,” then the solution of problem IIL,, 7, 
in Diophantus, viz., to find three numbers whose sum is a 
square and such that any pair is a square, is as follows: “Let 
us assume the sum of the three numbers to be equal to the 
square'1S. 2.N. 1 U., the first and the second together 1 S. 
then the remainder 2.N. 1 U. will be the third number. Let 
the second and the third be equal to1S.1U. m. 2N,, of 
which the root is 1 N. m.1U. Now all three numbers are 
1S. 2N.10U.; hence the first will be 4.N. But this and 
the second together were put equal to 1 S., hence the second 
will be 1 8. minus 4. N. Consequently, the first and third 
together, 6 N. 1 U. must be a square. Let this number be 
121 U., then the number becomes 20 U. Hence the first is 
80 U., the second 320 U., the third 41 U., and they satisfy 
the conditions.” 
(3) Symbolic Algebras, in which all forms and operations 
are represented by a fully developed symbolism, as, for ex- 
ample, «+ 10%=39. In this class may be reckoned Hindu 
works as well as European since the middle of the seventeenth 
century. 
From this classification due to Nesselmann the advanced 
ground taken by the Hindus is brought to full view; also 
the step backward taken by the early Arabs. The Arabs, 
however, made substantial contributions to what we may call 
geometrical algebra. Not only did they (Alchwarizmi, Al

Karchi) give geometrical proofs, besides the arithmetical, for 
the solution of quadratic equations, but they (Al Mahani, Abi 
Dscha ‘far Alchazin, Abt’l Dschfid, ‘Omar Alchaijami) dis- 
covered a geometrical solution of cubic equations, which alge- 
braically were still considered insolvable. The roots were 
constructed by intersecting conics." 
Al Karchi was the first Arabic author to give and prove 
the theorems on the summation of the series:

18+ 22+ 3? +.--4+n8=(14+2+4---+4+n)? 
Allusion has been made to the fact that the Western Arabs 
developed an algebraic symbolism. While in the East the 
geometric treatment of algebra had become the fashion, in 
the West the Arabs elaborated arithmetic and algebra inde- 
pendently of geometry. Of interest to us ig a work by Alkal- 
sddi of Andalusia or of Granada, who died in 1486 or 1477. 
His book was entitled Raising of the Veil of the Science of 
Gubdr. The word “gubar” meant originally “dust,” and 
stands here for written arithmetic with numerals, in contrast 
to mental arithmetic. In addition, subtraction, and multipli- 
cation, the result is written above the other figures. The 
" square root is indicated by -S, the initial letter of the word 
dschidr, meaning “root,” particularly “square root.” Thus, 
V48 = = The proportion 7 : 12 = 84: @ was written \.°.84 
bliae-.7, the symbol for the unknown being here probably 
imagined to be the initial letter of the word dschahala, “not to 
know.” Observe that the Arabic writing is from right to left. 
In algebra proper, the unknown was expressed by the words

This symbolism probably began to be developed among the 
Western Arabs at least as early as the time of Ibn Albanna 
(born 1252 or 1257). It is of interest, when we remember 
that in the Latin translations made by Europeans this sym- 
bolism was imitated. 
Europe during the Middle Ages 
The barbaric nations, which from the swamps and forests of 
the North and from the Ural Mountains swept down upon 
Europe and destroyed the Roman Empire, were slower than 
the Mohammedans in acquiring the intellectual treasures and 
the civilization of antiquity. (The first traces of mathematical 
knowledge in the.Occident point to a Roman origin) 
Introduction of Roman Arithmetic. — After Boethius and 
Cassiodorius, mathematical activity in Italy died out. About

modelled after the Roman encyclopedias of Martinus Capella 
and of Cassiodorius. Part of it is taken up with the quad- 
ruvium. e gives definitions of technical terms and their 
etymologies; but does not describe the modes of computation 
then in vogue. He divides numbers into odd and even, speaks 
of perfect and excessive numbers, etc., and finally bursts out 
in admiration of number, as follows: “Take away number 
from all things, and everything goes to destruction.” } After 
Isidorus comes another century of complete darkness; then

‘appears the English monk, Bede the Venerable (672-735). 
His works contain treatises on the Computus, or the computa- 
tion of Easter-time, and on finger-reckoning. It appears that 
a finger-symbolism was then widely used for calculation. The 
correct determination of the time of Easter was a problem 
which in those days greatly agitated the church. The desira- 
bility of having at least one monk in each monastery who 
could determine the date of religious festivals appears to have 
been the greatest incentive then existing toward the study of 
arithmetic. vy “The computation of Easter-time,” says Cantor, 
“the real central point of time-computation, is founded by 
Bede as by Cassiodorius and others, upon the coincidence, 
once every nineteen years, of solar and lunar time, and makes 
no immoderate demands upon the arithmetical knowledge of 
the pupil who aims to solve simply this problem.”! It is not 
surprising that Bede has but little to say about fractions. In 
one place he mentions the Roman duodecimal division into 
ounces. : 
(The year in which Bede died is the year in which the next 
prominent thinker, Alewin (735-804) was born. Educated in 
Ireland, he afterwards, at the court of Charlemagne, directed 
the progress of education in the great Frankish Empire. In 
the schools founded by him at the monasteries were taught the 
psalms, writing, singing, computation (computus), and gram- 
mar.) As the determination of Easter could be of no particular 
interest or value to boys, the word computus probably refers 
to computation in general. We are ignorant of the modes of 
reckoning then employed. It is not probable that Alcuin was 
familiar with the abacus or the apices of Boethius. (He be- 
longed to that long list of scholars of the Middle Ages and of 
the Renaissance who dragged the theory of numbers into 
1Canror, I, 831.

theology. For instance, the number of beings created by God, , 
who created all things well, is six, because six is a perfect 
number (being equal to the sum of its divisors 1, 2, 3); but 
8 is a defective number, since its divisors 1+2+44<8, and, 
for that reason, the second origin of mankind emanated from 
the number 8, which is the number of souls said to have 
been in Noah’s Ark. ) 
There is a collection of “Problems for Quickening the 
Mind” which is certainly as old as 1000 a.p., and possibly 
older. Cantor is of the opinion that it was written much 
earlier, and by Alcuin. Among the arithmetical problems of 
this collection are the fountain-problems which we have en- 
countered in Heron, in the Greek anthology, and among the 
Hindus. Problem No. 26 reads: A dog chasing a rabbit, 
which has a start of 150 feet, jumps 9 feet every time the rab- 
bit jumps 7. To determine in how many leaps the dog over- 
takes the rabbit, 150 is to be divided by 2. The 35th problem 
is as follows: A dying man wills that if his wife, being with 
child, gives birth to a son, the son shall inherit 3 and the 
widow } of the property; but if a daughter is born, she shall 
inherit 7; and the widow ;5, of the property. How is the 
property to be divided if both a son and a daughter are born? 
This problem is of interest because by its close resemblance to 
a Roman problem it unmistakably betrays its Roman origin. 
However, its solution, given in the collection, is different from 
the Roman solution, and is quite erroneous. Some of the 
problems are geometrical, others are merely puzzles, such as 
the one of the wolf, goat, and cabbage-head, which we shall 
mention again. The collector of these problems evidently 
aimed to entertain and please his readers. It has been re- 
marked that the proneness to propound jocular questions is 
truly Anglo-Saxon, and that Alcuin was particularly noted in 
this respect. Of interest is the title which the collection 
I

  114 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
bears: “Problems for Quickening the Mind.” Do not these 
words bear testimony to the fact that even in the darkness of 
the Middle Ages the mind-developing power of mathematics 
was recognized? Plato’s famous inscription over the entrance 
of his academy is frequently quoted; here we have the less 
weighty, but significant testimony of a people hardly yet 
awakened from intellectual slumber. 
During the wars and confusion which followed the fall of 
the empire of Charlemagne, scientific pursuits were abandoned, 
but they were revived again in the tenth century, principally 
through the influence of one man, — Gerbert. He was born in 
Aurillac in Auvergne, received a monastic education, and en- 
gaged in study, chiefly of mathematics, in Spain. He became 
bishop at Rheims, then at Ravenna, and finally was made 
Pope under the name of Sylvester II. He died in 1003, after 
a life involved in many political and ecclesiastical quarrels. 
Gerbert made a careful study of the writings of Boethius, and 
published two arithmetical works,— Rule of Computation on 
the Abacus, and A Small Book on the Division of Numbers. 
Now for the first time do we get some insight into methods of 
computation. Gerbert used the abacus, which was probably 
unknown to Alcuin. In his younger days Gerbert taught 
school at Rheims —the trivium and quadruvium being: the 
subjects of instruction—and one of his pupils tells us that 
Gerbert ordered from his shield-maker a leathern calculating 
board, which was divided into 27 columns, and that counters 
of horn were prepared, upon which the first nine numerals 
(apices) were marked. Bernelinus, a pupil of Gerbert, de- 
scribes the abacus as consisting of a smooth board upon which 
geometricians were accustomed to strew blue sand, and then 
to draw their diagrams. ror arithmetical purposes the board 
was divided into.30 columns, of which three were reserved for 
fractions while the remaining 27 were divided into groups
-P-A-G-E-123
  
EUROPE DURING THE MIDDLE AGES 115 
with three columns in each. Every group of the columns was 
marked respectively by the letters C (centum, 100), D (decem, 
10), and S (singularis) or M (monas). . Bernelinus gives the 
nine numerals used (the apices of Boethius), and then remarks 
that the Greek letters may be used in their place. By the 
use of these columns any number can be written without intro- 
ducing the zero, and all operations in arithmetic can be per- 
formed. Indeed, the processes of addition, subtraction, and 
multiplication, employed by the abacists, agreed substantially 
with those of to-day. The adjoining figure shows the multi- 
plication of 4600 by 23.2 The process is as 
follows: 3-6=18; 3x4=12; 2-6=12; {¢|x OTx 
2x4=8;1+2+2=5; remove the 1,2, alas PAE ecm nee 
2, and put down 5; 1+1+4+8=10; re izlalel | 
move 1, 1, 8, and put down 1 in the column 1\2 
next to the left. Hence, the sum 105800. 8 | 2 
If counters were used, then our crossing 5 
out of digits (for example, of the digits1, [7/57 > \Q/3) 
2, 2 in the fourth column) must be im- 
agined to represent the removal of the counters 1, 2, 2, and 
the putting of a counter marked 5 in their place. If the 
numbers were written on sand, then the numbers 1, 2, 2 were 
erased and 5 written instead. 
The process of division was entirely different from the 
modern. So difficult has this operation appeared that the 
concept of a quotient may almost be said to be foreign to 
antiquity. Gerbert gave rules for division which apparently 
were framed to satisfy the following three conditions: (1) The 
use of the multiplication table shall be restricted as far as 
possible; at least, it shall never be required to multiply 
mentally a number of two digits by another of one digit; 
1 Cantor, I., 881. . ? Frreprem, p. 106.
-P-A-G-E-124
116 - A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
(2) Subtractions shall be avoided as much as possible and 
replaced by additions; (3) The operation shall proceed in a 
purely mechanical way, without requiring trials.! That it 
should be necessary to make such conditions, will perhaps not 
seem so strange, if we recollect that monks of the Middle 
Ages did not attend school during childhood and learn the 
multiplication table while the memory was fresh. Gerbert’s 
rules for division are the oldest extant. They are so brief as 
to be very obscure to the uninitiated, but were probably 
intended to aid the memory by calling to mind the successive 
steps of the process. In later manuscripts they are stated 
more fully. We illustrate this division by the 
example? 4087 +6 = 681. The process is a 
kind of “complementary division.” Begin- 
nings of this mode of procedure are found 
among the Romans, but so far as known it 
was never used by the Hindus or Arabs. It 
is called “complementary” because, in our 
example, for instance, not 6, but 10 —6 or 4 
is the number operated with. The rationale 
of the process may, perhaps, be seen from this 
partial explanation: 4000+ 10= 400, write 
this below as part of the quotient. But 10 is 
too large a divisor; to rectify the error, add 
4.400 = 1600. Then 1000+10=100, write 
this below as part of the quotient; to rectify 
this new error, add 4.100 =400. Then 600 + 
400 =1000. Divide 1000+10, and so on. 
It will be observed that in complementary T|o-|x

«now the multiplication table above the 5’s.1 To a modern 
computor it would seem as though the above process of divi- 
sion were about as complicated as human ingenuity could 
make it. No wonder that it was said of Gerbert that he gave 
rules for division which were hardly understood by the most 
painstaking abacists; no wonder that the Arabic method of 
division, when first introduced into Europe, was called the 
“golden division” (divisio aurea), but the one on the abacus 
the “iron division” (divisio ferrea). 
The question has been asked, whence did Gerbert get his 
abacus and his complementary division? The abacus was 
probably derived from the works of Boethius, but the comple- 
mentary division is nowhere found in its developed form before 
the time of Gerbert. Was it mainly his invention? From one 
of his letters it appears that he had studied a paper on multipli- 
cation and division by “ Joseph Sapiens,” but modern research 
has as yet revealed nothing regarding this man or his writings.’ 
Above the 6 write 4, which is the difference between 10 and 6. Multiply 
this difference 4 into 4 in the column I and move the product 16 to the 
right by one column; erase the 4 in column I and write it in column C, 
below the lower horizontal line, as part of the quotient. Multiply the 1 
in I by 4, write the product 4 in column C; erase the 1 and write it 
below, one column to the right. Add the numbers in C, 6 + 4= 10, and 
write lin I. Then proceed as before: 1.4 = 4, write it in C, and write 
1 below. 4.4=16 in C and X, 4 below in X; 1.4=4 in X, 1 below;

digits in the columns below and the sum 681 is the answer sought, i.e. 
4087 -- 6 = 681, leaving the remainder 1.

  118 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
In course of the next five centuries the instruments for 
abacal computation were considerably modified. Not only did 
the computing tables, strewn with sand, disappear, but also 
Gerbert’s abacus with vertical columns and marked counters 
(apices). In their place there was used a calculating board 
with lines drawn horizontally (from left to right) and with 
counters all alike and unmarked. Its use is explained in the 
first printed arithmeties, and will be described under Recorde. 
The new instrument was employed in Germany, France, 
England, but not in Italy.? 
Translation of Arabic Manuscripts.— Among the transla- 
tions which were made in the period beginning with the 
twelfth century is the arithmetic of Alchwarizmi (probably 
translated by Athelard of Bath), the algebra of Alchwarizmi 
_ (by Gerard of Cremona in Lombardy) and the astronomy of Al 
Battani (by Plato of Tivoli). John of Seville wrote a liber 
alghoarismi, compiled by him from Arabic authors. Thus Ara- 
bie arithmetic and algebra acquired a fodthold in Europe. 
Arabic or rather Hindu methods of computation, with the 
zero and the principle of local value, began to displace the 
abacal modes of computation. But the victory of the new 
over the old was not immediate. The struggle between the 
two schools of arithmeticians, the old abacistic school and the 
new algoristic school, was incredibly long. The works issued 
by the two schools possess most striking differences, from 
which it would seem clear that the two parties drew from in- 
dependent sources, and yet it is argued by some that Gerbert 
got his apices and his arithmetical knowledge, not from 
Boethius, but from the Arabs in Spain, and that part or the 
whole of the geometry of Boethius is a forgery, dating from 
the time of Gerbert. If this were the case, then we should

expect the writings of Gerbert to betray Arabic sources, as do 
those of John of Seville. But no points of resemblance are 
found. Gerbert could not have learned from the Arabs the 
use of the abacus, because we possess no reliable evidence that 
the Arabs ever used it. The contrast between algorists and 
abacists consists in this, that unlike the latter, the former 
mention the Hindus, use the term algorism, calculate with the 
zero, and do not employ the abacus. The former teach the 
extraction of roots, the abacists do not; the algorists teach 
sexagesimal fractions used by the Arabs, while the abacists 
employ the duodecimals of the Romans. 
The First Awakening. — Towards the close of the twelfth 
century there arose in Italy a man of genuine mathematical 
power. He was not a monk, like Bede, Alcuin, and Gerbert, 
but a business man, whose leisure hours were given to mathe- 
matical study. To Leonardo of Pisa, also called Fibonacci, or 
Fibonaci, we owe the first renaissance of mathematics on 
Christian soil. When a boy, Leonardo was taught the use 
of the abacus. In later years, during his extensive travels 
in Egypt, Syria, rdece, and Sicily, he became familiar with 
various modes of\computation. Of the several processes 
he found the Hindw~unquestionably the best. After his 
return home, he published in 1202 a Latin work, the liber 
abaci.. A second edition appeared in 1828. While this book 
contains pretty much the entire arithmetical and algebraical 
knowledge of the Arabs, it demonstrates its author to be more 
than a mere compiler or slavish imitator. The liber abaci 
begins thus: “The nine figures of the Hindus are 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 
4, 3, 2, 1. With these nine figures and with this sign, 0, 
which in Arabic is called sifr, any number may be written.” 
The Arabic sifr (sifra = empty) passed into the Latin zephirum 
and the English cipher. If it be remembered that the Arabs 
wrote from right to left, it becomes evident how Leonardo, 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
120 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
in the above quotation, came to write the digits in descend: 
ing rather than ascending order; it is plain also how he 
came to write $182 instead of 182}. The liber abaci is the 
earliest work known to contain a recurring series.!_ Interest- 
ing is the following problem of the seven old women, because 
it is given (in somewhat different form) by Ahmes, 3000 years 
earlier: Seven old women go to Rome, each woman has seven 
mules, each mule carries seven sacks, each sack contains seven 
loaves, with each loaf are seven knives, each knife rests in 
seven sheaths. What is the sum total of all named? Ans. 
137256.2 Leonardo’s treatise was for centuries the storehouse 
from which authors drew material for their arithmetical and 
algebraical books. Leonardo’s algebra was purely “ rhetor- 
ical”; that is, devoid of all algebraic symbolism. 
Leonardo’s fame spread over Italy, and Emperor Frederick 
II. of Hohenstaufen desired to meet him. The presentation 
of the celebrated algebraist to the great patron of learning was 
accompanied by a famous scientific tournament. John of 
Palermo, an imperial notary, proposed several problems which 
Leonardo solved promptly. The first was to find the number @, 
such that «+5 and x*—5 are each square numbers. The 
answer is x = 3,5,; for 85,)?+5=(47,)"; (85)?-—5 =(2;5)% 
The Arabs had already solved similar problems, but some parts 
of Leonardo’s solution seem original with him. The second 
problem was the solution of a+ 2a?+10%=20. The general 
algebraic solution of cubic equations was unknown at that 
time, but Leonardo succeeded in approximating to one of the 
roots. He gave «= 1°22'7'4!"'33'4"40", the answer being 
thus expressed in sexagesimal fractions. Converted into deci- 
mals, this value furnishes figures correct to nine places. These 
and other problems solved by Leonardo disclose brilliant

talents. His geometrical writings will be touched upon 
later. 
In Italy the Hindu numerals were readily accepted by the 
enlightened masses, but at first rejected by the learned circles. 
Italian merchants used them as early as the thirteenth cen- 
tury; in 1299 the Florentine merchants were forbidden the 
use of the Hindu numerals in bookkeeping, and ordered either 
to use the Roman numerals or to write numbers out in words." 
The reason for this decree lies probably in the fact that the 
Hindu numerals as then employed had not yet assumed fixed, 
definite shapes, and the variety of forms for certain digits 
sometimes gave rise to ambiguity, misunderstanding, and fraud. 
In our own time, even, sums of money are always written out 
in words in case of checks or notes. Among the Italians are 
evidences of an early maturity of arithmetic. Says Peacock, 
“The Tuscans generally, and the Florentines in particular, 
whose city was the cradle of the literature and arts of the thir- 
teenth and fourteenth centuries, were celebrated for their know- 
ledge of arithmetic; the method of bookkeeping, which is called 
especially Italian, was invented by them; and the operations 
of arithmetic, which were so necessary to the proper conduct 
of their extensive commerce, appear to have been cultivated 
and improved by them with particular care; to them we are 
indebted . . . for the formal introduction into books of arith- 
metic, under distinct heads, of questions in the single and 
double rule of three, loss and gain, fellowship, exchange, sim- 
ple interest, discount, compound interest, and so on.”? 
In Germany, France, and England, the Hindu numerals 
were scarcely used, until after the middle of the fifteenth 
century.’ A small book on Hindu arithmetic, entitled De arte 
numerandi, called also Algorismus, was read, mainly in France

and Italy, for several centuries. It is usually ascribed to John 
Halifax, also called Sacrobosco, or Holywood, who was born 
in Yorkshire, and educated at Oxford, but who afterwards set- 
tled in Paris and taught there until his death, in 1256. The 
booklet contains rules without proofs and without numerical 
examples; it ignores fractions. It was printed in 1488 and 
many times later. According to De Morgan it is the “first 
arithmetical work ever printed in a French town (Strasbourg).”? 
Here and there some of our modern notions were anticipated 
by writers of the Middle Ages. For example, Nicole Oresme, a 
bishop in Normandy (about 1323-1382), first conceived the 
notion of fractional powers, afterwards rediscovered by Stevin, 
and suggested a notation for them. Thus,’ since 4°= 64 and 
V64 = 8, it follows that 4% = 8. In Oresme’s notation 4% is

fifteenth centuries brought forth comparatively little in the

Our account of Hindu geometrical research will be very

the Hindus never possessed a science of geometry; in the

figure in geometrical matters as the teachers of other nations. 
Their early geometry was original, their later geometry 
came from Greece and China. Brahmagupta gives the 
“Heronic Formula” for the area of a triangle. He also 
gives the proposition of Ptolemeus, that the product of the 
diagonals of a quadrilateral is equal to the sum of the product 
of the opposite sides, and adds new theorems of his own on 
quadrilaterals inscribed in a circle. The calculation of areas 
forms the chief part of Hindu geometry. Aryabhatta gives 
a= 34416, Interesting is 
Bhaskara’s proof of the / 
theorem of the right tri- | 
angle. He draws a right 
triangle four times in the 
square of the hypotenuse, so that in the middle there remains 
a square whose side equals the difference between the two 
sides of the right triangle. Arranging this small square and   
    
  
  
the four triangles in a different way, they are seen, together, 
to make up the sum of the squares of the two sides. “ Be- 
hold,” says Bhaskara, without adding another word of ex- 
planation. Rigid forms of demonstration are unusual with 
the Hindus. This proof is given much earlier by a Chinese | 
writer. Pythagoras’ proof may have been like this. In 
another place Bhaskara gives a second demonstration of this 
theorem by drawing from the vertex of the right angle a 
perpendicular to the hypotenuse, and then suitably manipulat- 
ing the proportions yielded by the similar triangles. This proof 
was unknown in Europe until it was rediscovered by Wallis. 
More successful were the Hindus in the cultivation of 
trigonometry. As with the Greeks, so with them, it was 
valued merely as a tool in astronomical research. Like the 
Babylonians and Greeks, they divide the circle into 360 de- 
grees and 21,600 minutes. Taking 7=3.1416, and 2 7r=21,600,

they got r= 3438; that is, the radius contained nearly 3438 
of these circular parts. This step was not Grecian. Some 
Greek mathematicians would have had scruples about measur- 
ing a straight line by a part of a curve. With Ptolemy the 
division of the radius into sexagesimal parts was independent 
of the division of the circumference; no common unit of 
measure was selected. The Hindus divided each quadrant 
into 24 equal parts, so that each of these parts contained 225 
out of the 21,600 units. A vital feature of Hindu trigonometry 
is that they did not, like the Greeks, reckon with the whole 
chord of double a given are, but with the sine of the are (i.e. 
half the chord of double the arc) and with the versed sine of 
the are. The entire chord AB was called 
by the Brahmins jyé or jiva, words which 
meant also the cord of a hunter’s bow. 
For AC, or half the chord, they used the 
words jydrdha or ardhajyd, but the names 
of the whole chord were also used for 
brevity. It is interesting to trace the his- 
tory of these words. The Arabs transliterated jivd or jiva into 
dschiba. For this they afterwards used the word dschaib, of 
nearly the same form, meaning “bosom.” This, in turn, was 
translated into Latin, as sinus, by Plato of Tivoli. Thus arose 
the word sine in trigonometry. For “versed sine,” the Hindus 
used the term utkramajyd, for “cosine,” kotijyd.1 Observe 
that the Hindus used three of our trigonometric functions, 
while the Greeks considered only the chord. 
The Hindus computed a table of sines by a theoretically. 
simple method. The sine of 90° was equal to the radius, or 
3438; the chord of an arc AB of 60° was also 3438, therefore 
half this chord AC, or the sine of 30°, was 1719. Applying the

formula sin?a-+cos?a=7’, and observing that sin 45°=cos 45°, 
they obtained sin 45° =\5 = 2431. Substituting for cos a its 
equal sin (90 — a), and making a = 60°, they obtained 
sin 60° = 4V37? = 2978. 
With the sines of 90, 60, 45 as starting-points, they reckoned 
the sines of half the angles by the formula versin 2 a=2 sin’ a, 
thus obtaining the sines of 22°30', 15°, 11°15’, 7° 30', 3°45". 
They now figured out the sines of the complements of these 
angles, namely, the sines of 86°15', 82° 30', 78° 45', 75°, 67° 30'; 
then they calculated the sines of half these angles; thereof 
their complements, and so on. By this very simple process 
they got the sines of all the angles at intervals of 3°45! 
No Indian treatise on the trigonometry of the triangle is 
extant. In astronomical works, there are given solutions of 
plane and spherical right triangles. Scalene triangles were 
divided up into right triangles, whereby all ordinary compu- 
tations could be carried out. As the table of sines gave the 
values for angles at intervals of 3% degrees, the sines of inter- 
vening angles had to be found by interpolation. Astronomical 
observations and computations possessed only a passable 
degree of accuracy. 
Arabs 
The Arabs added hardly anything to the ancient stock of 
geometrical knowledge. Yet they play an all-important role 
in mathematical history; they were the custodians of Greek 
and Oriental science, which, in due time, they transmitted to

the Occident. The starting-point for all geometric study 
among the Arabs was the Hlements of Euclid. Over and over 
again was this great work translated by them into the Arabic 
tongue. Imagine the difficulties encountered in such a trans- 
lation. Here we see a people, just emerged from barbarism, 
untrained in mathematical thinking, and with limited facilities 
for the accurate study of languages. Where was to be found 
the man, who, without the aid of grammars and dictionaries, 
had become versed in both Greek and Arabic, and was at 
the same time a mathematician? How could highly refined 
scientific thought be conveyed to undeveloped minds by an 
undeveloped language? Certainly it is not strange that sev- 
eral successive efforts at translation had to be made, each 
translator resting upon the shoulders of his predecessor. 
Arabic rulers wisely enlisted the aid of Greek scholars. In 
Syria the sciences, especially philosophy and medicine, were 
cultivated by Greek Christians. Celebrated were the schools 
at Antioch and Emesa, and the Nestorian school at Edessa. 
After the sack and ruin of Alexandria, in 640, they became the 
chief repositories in the East of Greek learning. Euclid’s 
Elements were translated into Syriac. From Syria Greek 
Christians were called to Bagdad, the Mohammedan capital. 
During the time of the Caliph Haran ar-Raschid (786-809) was 
made the first Arabic translation of Ptolemy’s Almagest; also 
of Euclid’s Elements (first six books) by Haddschddsch ibn 
Jisuf ibn Matar.’ He made a second translation under the 
Caliph Al Mamfin (813-833). This caliph secured as a con- 
dition, in a treaty of peace with the emperor in Constanti-

nople, a large number of Greek manuscripts, which he ordered 
translated into Arabic. Euclid’s Elements and the Sphere 
and Cylinder of Archimedes were translated by Aba Ja‘kab 
Ishak ibn Hunain, under the supervision of his father Hunain 
ibn Ishdk.' These renderings were unsatisfactory; the trans- 
lators, though good philologians, were poor mathematicians. 
At this time there were added to the thirteen books of the 
Elements the fourteenth, by Hypsicles (?), and the fifteenth by 
Damascius (?). It remained for Tabit ibn Kurrah (836-901) to 
bring forth an Arabic Euclid satisfying every need. Among 
other important translations into Arabic were the mathemati- 
cal works of Apollonius, Archimedes, Heron, and Diophantus. 
Thus, in course of one century, the Arabs gained access to the 
vast treasures of Greek science. 
A later and important Arabic edition of Euclid’s Elements 
was that of the gifted Nasir Eddin (1201-1274), a Persian 
astronomer who persuaded his patron Hfilagfi to build him and 
his associates a large observatory at Maraga. He tried his 
skill at a proof of the parallel-postulate. In all such attempts, 
some new assumption is made which is equivalent to the thing 
to be proved. Thus Nasir Eddin assumes that if AB is 1 to 
CD at OC, and if another straight line HDF makes the angle 
EDC acute, then the perpendiculars to AB, comprehended 
between AB and EF, and drawn on the side of CD toward E, 
are shorter and shorter, the further they are from CD.’ It is 
difficult to see how in any case this can be otherwise, unless 
one looks with the eyes of Lobatchewsky or Bolyai. Nasir 
Eddin’s “proof” had some influence on the later development 
of the theory of parallels. His edition of Euclid was printed 
in Arabic at Rome in 1594 and his “proof” was brought out

in Latin translation by Wallis in 1651.’ Of interest is a new 
proof of the Pythagorean Theorem which Nasir Eddin adds to 
the Euclidean proof.? An earlier demonstration, for the special 
ease of an isosceles right triangle,’ is given by Muhammed ibn 
Misi Alchwarizmi who lived during the reign of Caliph Al 
Mamfin, in the early part of the ninth century. Alchwarizmi’s 
meagre treatment of geometry, as contained in his work on 
Algebra, is the earliest Arabic effort in this science. It 
bears unmistakable evidence of Hindu influences. Besides the 
value += 34, it contains also the Hindu values r= V10 and 
aw = $2832. Jn later Arabic works, Hindu geometry hardly 
ever shows itself; Greek geometry held undisputed sway. In 
a book by the sons of Masd ibn Schdkir (who in his youth was 
a robber) is given the Heronic Formula for the area of a tri- 
angle. A neat piece of research is displayed in the “ geometric 
constructions” by Aba’l Wafé (940-998), a native of Buzshan 
in Chorassan. He improved the theory of draughting by show- 
ing how to construct the corners of the regular polyedrons on 
the circumscribed sphere. Here, for the first time, appears 
the condition which afterwards became very famous in the 
Occident, that the construction be effected with a single open- 
ing of the compasses.

and Wipper’s collections of proofs for this theorem, Nasir Eddin’s proof 
is given without any reference to him. 
8 Some Arabic writers, Beha Eddin for instance, called the Pythagorean 
Theorem the ‘‘ figure of the bride.’ This romantic appellation originated 
probably in a mistranslation of the Greek word wun, applied to the 
theorem by a Byzantine writer of the thirteenth century. This Greek 
word admits of two meanings, ‘‘ bride” and ‘‘ winged insect.” The fig- 
ure of a right triangle with its three squares suggests an insect, but Beha 
Eddin apparently translated the word as ‘‘ bride.’? See Paut Tannery, 
in L’Intermediaire des Mathématiciens, 1894, T. L., p. 254.

is the geometric solution of cubic equations and the develop- 
ment of trigonometry. As early as 773 Caliph Almansur came 
into possession of the Hindu table of sines, probably taken 
from Brahmagupta’s Siddhdnta. The Arabs called the table 
the Sindhind and held it in high authority. They also came 
into early possession of Ptolemy’s Almagest and of other Greek 
astronomical works. Muhammed ibn Misd Alchwarizmi was 
engaged by Caliph Al Mamfin in making extracts from the 
Sindhind, in revising the tables of Ptolemy, in taking obser- 
vations at Bagdad and Damascus, and in measuring the degree 
of the earth’s meridian. Remarkable is the 
derivation, by Arabic authors, of formule P F 
in spherical trigonometry, not from the , <7 
“rule of six quantities of Menelaus,” as 
previously, but from the “rule of four Q Q, 
quantities.” This is: If PP, and QQ, be 
two arcs of great circles intersecting in A, and if PQ and 
P,Q, be ares of great circles drawn perpendicular to QQ,, then 
we have the proportion 
sin AP: sin PQ = sin AP,: sin P,Qy. 
This departure from the time-honoured procedure adopted by 
Ptolemy was formerly attributed to Dschdbir ibn Aflah, but 
recent study of Arabic manuscripts indicates that the transi- 
tion from the “rule of six quantities” to the “rule of four 
quantities” was possibly effected already by Tabit ibn Kurrah* 
(836-901), the change being adopted by other writers who 
preceded Dschabir ibn Aflah.?

  130 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
Al Battdni, called Albategnius by the Latins. Battan in Syria 
was his birth-place. His work, De scientia stellarum, was 
translated into Latin by Plato Tiburtinus, in the twelfth 
century. In this translation the Arabic word dschiba, from 
the Sanskrit jiva, is said to have been rendered by the word 
sinus; hence the origin of “sine.” Though a diligent student 
of Ptolemy, Al Battani did not follow him altogether. He 
took an important step for the better, when he introduced the 
Indian “sine” or half the chord, in place of the whole chord 
of Ptolemy. Another improvement on Greek trigonometry 
made by the Arabs points likewise to Indian influences: 
Operations and propositions treated by the Greeks geometri- 
cally, are expressed by the Arabs algebraically. Thus Al 
Batténi at once gets from an equation sue cos   
= D, the value of 
6 by means of sind = D+~V1+D*%, a process unknown to 
Greek antiquity... To the formule known to Ptolemy he adds 
an important one of his own for oblique-angled spherical tri- 
angles; namely, cos a = cos b cose + sind sine cos A. 
Important are the researches of Abd’l Wafd. He invented 
a method for computing tables of sines which gives the sine 
of half a degree correct to nine decimal places.2 He and Al- 
Battani, in the study of shadow-triangles cast by sun-dials, 
introduced the trigonometric functions tangent and cotangent ; 
he used also the secant and cosecant. An important change 
in method was inaugurated by Dschdbir ibn Aflah of Seville 
in Spain (in the second half of the eleventh century) and by 
Nasir Eddin (1201-1274) in distant Persia. In the works of 
the last two authors we find for the first time trigonometry 
developed as a part of pure mathematics, independently of 
astronomy.

We do not desire to go into greater detail, but would em- 
phasize the fact that Nasir Eddin in the far East, during a 
temporary cessation of military conquests by Tartar rulers, 
developed both plane and spherical trigonometry to a very 
remarkable degree. Suter! enthusiastically asks, what would 
have remained for European scholars of the fifteenth century 
to do in trigonometry, had they known of these researches ? 
Or were some of them, perhaps, aware of these investigations ? 
To this question we can, as yet, give no final answer. 
Europe during the Middle Ages 
Introduction of Roman Geometry. — Before the introduction 
of Arabic learning into Europe, the knowledge of geometry in 
the Occident cannot be said to have exceeded that of the 
Egyptians in 600 8.c. The monks of the Middle Ages did not 
go much beyond the definitions of the triangle, quadrangle, 
circle, pyramid, and cone (as given in the Roman encyclo- 
pedia of the Carthaginian, Martianus Capella), and the simple 
rules of mensuration. In Alewin’s “Problems for Quickening 
the Mind,” the areas of triangular and quadrangular pieces of 
land are found by the same formule of approximation as 
those used by the Egyptians and given by Boethius in his 
geometry: The rectangle equals the product of half the sums 
of the opposite sides; the triangle equals the product of half 
the sum of two sides and half the third side. After Alcuin, 
the great mathematical light of Europe was Gerbert (died 
1003). In Mantua he found the geometry of Boethius and 
studied it zealously. It is usually believed that Gerbert him- 
self was the author of a geometry. This contains nothing

more than the geometry of Boethius, but the fact that occa- 
sional errors in Boethius are herein corrected shows that the 
author had mastered the sub- 
ject.!. “The earliest mathemat- 
ical paper of the Middle Ages 
which deserves this name is a 
letter of Gerbert to Adalbold, 
bishop of Utrecht,” ? in which 
is explained the reason why 
the area of a triangle, obtained 
“ geometrically ” by taking the 
product of the base by its altitude, differs from the area calcu- 
lated “arithmetically,” according to the formula ta(a +1), 
used by surveyors, where a stands for a side of an equilateral 
triangle. Gerbert gives the correct explanation, that in the 
latter formula all the small rectangles, into which the triangle 
is supposed to be divided, are counted in wholly, even though 
parts of them project beyond it. 
Translation of Arabic Manuscripts. —The beginning of the 
twelfth century was one of great intellectual unrest. Philos- 
ophers longed to know more of Aristotle than could be learned 
through the writings of Boethius; mathematicians craved a 
profounder mathematical knowledge. Greek texts were not 
at hand; so the Europeans turned to the Mohammedans for 
instruction; at that time the Arabs were the great scholars 
of the world. We read of an English monk, Athelard of 
Bath, who travelled extensively in Asia Minor, Egypt, and 
Spain, braving a thousand perils, that he might acquire the 
language and science of the Mohammedans. “The Moorish

universities of Cordova and Seville and Granada were dan- 
gerous resorts for Christians.” He made what is probably the 
earliest translation from the Arabic into Latin of Euclid’s 
Elements, in 1120. He translated also the astronomical 
tables of Muhammed ibn Miis& Alchwarizmi. In his trans- 
lation of Euclid from the Arabic there is ground for 
suspicion that Athelard was aided by a previous Latin 
translation.” 
All important Greek mathematical works were translated 
from the Arabic. Gerard of Cremona in Lombardy went to 
Toledo and there in 1175 translated the Almagest. We are 
told that he translated into Latin 70 works, embracing the 15 
books of Euclid, Euclid’s Data, the Spherica of Theodosius, 
and a work of Menelaus. <A new translation of Euclid’s 
1 We are surprised to read in the Dictionary of National Biography 
[Leslie Stephen’s] that ‘‘it has not yet been determined whether the 
translation of Euclid’s Elements . . . was made from the Arabic version 
or from the original.’’? To our knowledge no mathematical historian now 
doubts that the translation was made from the Arabic or suspects that 
Athelard used the Greek text. See Cantor, I.,713, 906; II., 100. Hanxer, 
p. 835; S. Ginrner, Math. Unt. im d. Mittelalt., pp. 147-149 ; W. W.

146; Horrer, Histoire des Mathématiques, 1879, p. 821. Remarkable is 
the fact that Marir, in-his 12-volume history of mathematics, not even 
mentions Athelard. He says that Campanus ‘‘a donné des Lléments 
d’Euclide la premiére traduction qu’on ait eue en Europe.”” Marre, IL, 
p. 158. 
2 Canror, IT., 100-102. In a geometrical manuscript in the British 
Museum it is said that geometry was invented in Egypt by Eucleides. 
This verse is appended : 
‘‘Thys craft com ynto England, as y ghow say, 
Yn tyme of good Kyng Adelstones day.” 
See Hatiiwext’s Rara Mathematica, London, 1841, p. 56, ete. As King 
Athelstan lived about 200 years before Athelard, it would seem that a 
Latin Euclid (perhaps only the fragments given by Boethius) was known 
in England long before Athelard.
-P-A-G-E-142
  134 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
Elements was made, about 1260, by Giovanni Campano (latin- 
ized form, Campanus) of Novara in Italy. It displaced the 
earlier ones and formed the basis of the printed editions. 
The First Awakening. —The central figure in mathematical 
history of this period is the gifted Leonardo of Pisa (1175-?). 
His main researches are in algebra, but his Practica Geometric, 
published in 1220, is a work disclosing skill and geometric 
rigour. The writings of Euclid and of some other Greek 
masters were known to him, either directly from Arabic manu- 
scripts or from the translations made by his countrymen, 
Gerard of Cremona and Plato of Tivoli. Leonardo gives ele- 
gant demonstrations of the “Heronic Formula” and of the 
theorem that the medians of a triangle meet in a point (known 
to Archimedes, but not proved by him). He also gives the 
theorem that the square of the diagonal of a rectangular 
parallelopiped is equal to the sum of the three squares of its 
sides.!. Algebraically are solved problems like this: To in- 
scribe in an equilateral triangle a square resting upon the base 
of the triangle. 
A geometrical work similar to Leonardo’s in Italy was 
brought out in Germany about the same time by the monk 
Jordanus Nemorarius. It was entitled De triangulis, and was 
printed by Curtze in 1887. It indicates a decided departure 
from Greek models, though to Euclid reference is frequently 
made. There is nothing to show that it was used anywhere as a 
text-book in schools. This work, like Leonardo’s, was probably 
read only by the élite. As specimens of remarkable theorems, 
we give the following: If circles can be inscribed and circum- 
scribed about an irregular polygon, then their centres do not 
coincide; of all inscribed triangles having a common base, the 
isosceles is the maximum. Jordanus accomplishes the trisec- 
tion of an angle by giving a graduated ruler simultaneously a

-P-A-G-E-143
EUROPE DURING THE MIDDLE AGES 135 
rotating and a sliding motion, its final position being fixed 
with aid of a certain length marked on the ruler.’ In this 
trisection he does not permit himself to be limited to Euclid’s 
postulates, which allow the use simply of an unmarked ruler 
and a pair of compasses. He also introduces motion of parts of 
a figure after the manner of some Arabic authors. Such motion 
is foreign.to Euclid’s practice.” The same mode of trisection 
was given by Campanus. 
Jordanus’s attempted exact quadrature of the circle lowers 
him in our estimation. Circle-squaring now began to com- 
mand the lively attention of mathematicians. Their efforts 
remained as futile as though they had attempted to jump into 
a rainbow ; the moment taey thought they had touched the 
goal, it vanished as by magic, and was as far as ever from 
their reach. In their excitement many of them became sub- 
ject to mental illusions, and imagined that they had actually 
attained their aim, and were in the midst of a triumphal arch 
of glory, the wonder and admiration of the world. 
The fourteenth and fifteenth centuries have brought forth 
no geometricians who equalled Leonardo of Pisa. Much was 
written on mathematics, and an effort put forth to digest the 
rich material acquired from the Arabs. No substantial con- 
tributions were made to geometry. ' 
An English manuscript of the fourteenth century, on sur- 
veying, bears the title: Nowe sues here a Tretis of Geometri 
wherby you may knowe the heghte, depnes, and the brede of most- 
what erthely thynges.® The oldest French geometrical manu- 
script (of about 1275) is likewise anonymous. Like the Eng- 
lish treatise, it deals with mensuration. From the study of

136 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
manuscripts, made to the present time, it would seem that 
since the thirteenth century surveying in Europe had de- 
parted from Roman models and come completely under the 
influence of the Graeco-Arabic writers.! An author of consid- 
erable prominence was Thomas Bradwardine (1290 ?-1349), 
archbishop of Canterbury. He was educated at Merton Col- 
lege, Oxford, and later lectured in that university on theology, 
philosophy, and mathematics. His philosophic writings con- 
tain able discussions of the infinite and the infinitesimal — sub- 
jects which thenceforth came to be studied in connection with 
mathematics. Bradwardine wrote several mathematical treat- 
ises. A Geometria speculativa was printed in Paris in 1511 as 
the work of Bradwardinus, but has been attributed by some to 
a Dane, named Petrus, then a resident of Paris. This remarka- 
ble work enjoyed a wide popularity. It 
treats of the regular solids, of isoperimetrical 
figures in the manner of Zenodorus, and of 
star-polygons. The first appearance of such 
polygons was with Pythagoras and his school. 
The pentagram-star was used by the Pythag- 
oreans as a badge or symbol of recognition, and was called 
by them Health.? We next meet such polygons in the geom- 
etry of Boethius, in the translation of Euclid from the 
Arabic by Athelard of Bath, and by Campanus, and in the 
earliest French geometric treatise, mentioned above. Brad- 
wardine develops some geometric properties of star-polygons 
—their construction and angle-sum. We encounter these fas- 
cinating figures again in Regiomontanus, Kepler, and others. 
In Bradwardine and a few other British scholars England 
proudly claims the earliest European writers on trigonome- 
try. Their writings contain trigonometry drawn from Arabic 
1Canror, II, 127. 2 Gow, p. 151.
-P-A-G-E-145
  EUROPE DURING THE MIDDLE AGES 187 
sources. John Maudith, professor at Oxford about 1340, 
speaks of the umbra (“tangent”); Bradwardine uses the 
terms wmbra recta (“ cotangent”) and umbra versa (“tangent”)! 
which occur in Gerard of Cremona’s translation of Al-Arzakel’s 
Toledian tables. The Hindus had introduced the sine, versed 
sine, cosine; the Arabs the tangent, cotangent, secant, cosecant. 
Perhaps the greatest result of the introduction of Arabic 
learning was the establishment of universities. What was 
their attitude toward mathematics? At the University of 
Paris geometry was neglected. In 1336 a rule was intro- 
duced that no student should take a degree without attending 
lectures on mathematics, and from a commentary on the first 
six books of Euclid, dated 1536, it appears that candidates 
for the degree of A.M. had to take oath that they had 
attended lectures on these books.” Examinations, when held 
at all, probably did not extend beyond the first book, as is 
shown by the nickname “ magister matheseos” applied to the 
theorem of Pythagoras, the last of the book. At Prague, 
founded in 1384, astronomy and applied mathematics were 
additional requirements. Roger Bacon, writing near the close 
of the thirteenth century, says that at Oxford there were few 
students who cared to go beyond the first three or four propo- 
sitions of Euclid, and that on this account the fifth proposition 
was called “elefuga,” that is, “flight of the wretched.” We 
are told that this fifth proposition was later called the “pons 
asinorum” or “the Bridge of Asses.”* Clavius in his Euclid, 
edition of 1591, says of this theorem, that beginners find it

difficult and obscure, on account of the multitude of lines 
and angles, to which they are not yet accustomed. These 
last words, no doubt, indicate the reason why geometrical 
study seems to have been so pitifully barren. Students with 
no kind of mathematical training, perhaps unable to perform 
the simplest arithmetical computations, began to memorize 
the abstract definitions and propositions of Euclid. Poor 
preparation and poor teaching, combined with an absence of 
rigorous requirements for degrees, probably explain this flight 
from geometry —this “elefuga.” In the middle of the fif- 
teenth century the first two books were read at Oxford. 
Thus it is seen that the study of mathematics was main- 
tained at the universities only in a half-hearted manner.

  MODERN TIMES 
  ARITHMETIC 
Its Development as a Science and Art 
Durine the sixteenth century the human mind made an 
extraordinary effort to achieve its freedom from scholastic and 
ecclesiastical bondage. This independent and vigorous intel- 
lectual activity is reflected in the mathematical books of the 
time. The best arithmetical work of the fifteenth as also 
of the sixteenth century emanated from Italian writers, — 
Lucas Pacioli and Tartaglia. Lucas Pacioli (1445 ?-1514 ?) 
—also called Lucas di Burgo, Luca Paciuolo, or Pacciuolus— 
was a Tuscan monk who taught mathematics at Perugia, 
Naples, Milan, Florence, Rome, and Venice. His treatise, 
Summa de Arithmetica, 1494, contains all the knowledge of 
his day on arithmetic, algebra, and trigonometry, and is 
the first comprehensive work which appeared after the 
liber abaci of Fibonaci. The earliest arithmetic known to have 
been brought out in print anywhere appeared anonymously in 
Treviso, Italy, in 1478, and is known as the “Treviso arithmetic.” 
Tartaglia’s real name was Nicolo Fontana (1499 ?-1557). 
When a boy of six, Nicolo was so badly cut by a French 
soldier, that he never again gained the free use of his tongue. 
Hence he was called Tartaglia, i.e. the stammerer. His 
widowed mother being too poor to pay his tuition at school, he 
139
-P-A-G-E-148
140 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
learned to read and acquired a knowledge of Latin, Greek, 
and mathematics without a teacher. Possessing a mind of 
extraordinary power, he was able to teach mathematics at an 
early age. He taught at Verona, Piacenza, Venice, and 
Brescia. It was his intention to embody his original re- 
searches in a great work, General trattato di numeri et misure, 
but at his death it was still unfinished. The first two parts 
were published in 1556, and treat of arithmetic. Tartaglia 
discusses commercial arithmetic somewhat after the manner 
of Pacioli, but with greater fulness and with simpler and 
more methodical treatment. His work contains a large num- 
ber of exercises and problems so arranged as to insure the 
reader’s mastery of one subject before proceeding to the next. 
Tartaglia bears constantly in mind the needs of the practical 
man. His description of numerical operations embraces seven 
different modes of multiplication and three methods of divis- 
ion.1 He gives the Venetian weights and measures. 
Mathematical study was fostered in Germany at the close 
of the fifteenth century by Georg Purbach and his pupil, 
Regiomontanus. The first printed German arithmetic appeared 
in 1482 at Bamberg. It is by Ulrich Wagner, a practitioner of 
Nirnberg. It was printed on parchment, but only fragments 
of one copy are now extant.2 In 1483 the same Bamberg 
publishers brought out a second arithmetic, printed on paper, 
and covering 77 pages. The work is anonymous, but Ulrich 
‘Wagner is believed to be its author. It is worthy of remark 
that the earliest printed German arithmetic appeared only four 
years after the first printed Italian arithmetic. The Bam- 
berg arithmetic of 1483, says Unger, bears no resemblance 
to previous Latin treatises, but is purely commercial. Modelled 
after it is the arithmetic by John Widmann, Leipzig, 1489.

This work has become famous, as being the earliest book in 
which the symbols + and — have been found. They occur in 
connection with problems worked by “ false position.” Wid- 
mann says, “what is —, that is minus; what is +, that is 
more.” The words “minus” and “more,” or “plus,” occur 
long before Widmann’s time in the works of Leonardo of 
Pisa, who uses them in connection with the method of 
false position in the sense of “positive error” and “ negative 
error.”1 While Leonardo uses “minus” also to indicate an 
operation (of subtraction), he does not so use the word “ plus.” 
Thus, 7+4 is written “septem et quatuor.” The word 
“plus,” signifying the operation of addition, was first found 
by Enestrém in an Italian algebra of the fourteenth century. 
The words “plus” and “minus,” or their equivalents in the 
modern tongues, were used by Pacioli, Chuquet, and Widmann. 
It is proved that the sign + comes from the Latin et, as it was 
cursively written at the time of the invention of printing. 
The origin of the sign — is still uncertain. These signs were 
used in Italy by Leonardo da Vinci very soon after their appear- 
ance in Widmann’s work. They were employed by Grammateus 
(Heinrich Schreiber), a teacher at the University of Vienna, by 
Christoff Rudolff in his algebra, 1525, and by Stifel in 1553. 
Thus, by slow degrees, their adoption became universal. 
During the early half of the sixteenth century some of 
the most prominent German mathematicians (Grammateus, 
Rudolff, Apian, Stifel) contributed toward the preparation of

practical arithmetics, but after that period this important 
work fell into the hands of the practitioners alone.! The most 
popular of the early text-book writers was Adam Riese, who 
published several arithmetics, but that of 1522 is the one 
usually associated with his name. 
A French work which in point of merit ranks with Pacioli’s 
Summa de Arithmetica, but which was never printed before the 
nineteenth century, is Le Triparty en la science des nombres, 
written in 1484 in Lyons by Nicolas Chuquet.2 A contempo- 
rary of Chuquet, in France, was Jacques Lefevre, who brought 
out printed editions of older mathematical works. For instance, 
in 1496 there appeared in print the arithmetic of the German 
monk, Jordanus Nemorarius, a work modelled after the arith- 
metic of Boethius, and at this time over two centuries old. 
A quarter of a century later, in 1520, appeared a popular 
French arithmetic by Estienne de la Roche, named also 
Villefranche. The author draws his material mainly from 
Chuquet and Pacioli.* 
We proceed now to the discussion of a few arithmetical 
topics. Down to the seventeenth century great diversity and 
clumsiness prevailed in the numeration of large numbers. 
Italian authors grouped digits into periods of six, others 
sometimes.into periods of three. Adam Riese, who did more 
than any one else in the first half of the sixteenth century 
toward spreading a knowledge of arithmetic in Germany, 
writes 86 789 325 178, and reads, “Sechs und achtzig 
tausend, tausend mal tausend, sieben hundert tausend mal 
tausendt, neun vnnd achtzig tausend mal tausend, drei hun- 
dert tausent, fiinff vnnd zwantzig tausend, ein hundert, acht

und siebentzig.”! Stifel in 1544 writes 2 329° 089 562 800, 
and reads, “duo millia millies millies millies; trecenta viginti 
novem millia millies millies; octoginta novem millia millies ; 
quingenta sexaginta duo millia; octingenta.” Tonstall, in 
1522, calls 10° “millies millena millia”? This habit of 
grouping digits, for purposes of numeration, did not exist 
among the Hindus. They had a distinct name for each suc- 
cessive step in the scale, and it has been remarked that 
this fact probably helped to suggest to them the principle of 
local value. They read 86789325178 as follows: “8 kharva, 
6 padma, 7 vyarbuda, 8 kéti, 9 prayuta, 3 laksha, 2 ayuta, 
5 sahasra, 1 cata, 7 dacon, 8.”* One great objection to this 
Hindu scheme is that it burdens the memory with too many 
names. 
(the first improvement on ancient and medizval methods 
of numeration was the invention of the word millione by the 
Italians in the fourteenth century, to signify great thousand,* 
or 10002. This new word seems originally to have indicated 
a concrete measure, 10 barrels of gold.® The words millione, 
nulla or cero (zero) occur for the first time in print in the 
Arithmetica of Borgi (1484). In the next two centuries the use 
of millione spread to other European countries. . Tonstall, in 
1522, speaks of the term as common in England, but rejects 
it as barbarous!) The seventh place in numeration he calls 
“millena millia; vulgus millionem barbare vocat.”" Diicange 
of Rymer mentions the word million in 1514; * in 1540 it occurs 
once in the arithmetic of Christoff Rudolff. 
The next decided advance was the introduction of the words

billion, trillion, ete. Their origin dates back almost to the 
time when the word million was first used. So far as known, 
they first occur in a manuscript work on arithmetic by that 
gifted French physician of Lyons, Nicolas Chuquet. He em- 
ploys the words byllion, tryllion, quadrillion, quyllion, sixlion, 
septyllion, octyllion, nonyllion, “et ainsi des aultres se plus 
oultre on voulait proceder,”’ to denote the second, third, etc. 
powers of a million, i.e. (1000,000)’, (1000,000)%, ete.t Evi- 
dently Chuquet had solved the difficult question of numera- 
tion. The new words used by him appear in 1520 in the 
printed work of La Roche. Thus the great honour of having 
simplified numeration of large numbers appears to belong to 
the French. In England and Germany the new nomenclat- 
ure was not introduced until about a century and a half 
later. In England the words billion, trillion, etc., were new 
when Locke wrote, about 1687.° In Germany these new terms 
appear for the first time in 1681 in a work by Heckenberg of 
Hanover, but they did not come into general use before the 
eighteenth century.* 
About the middle of the seventeenth century it became the 
custom in France to divide numbers into periods of three 
digits, instead of six, and to assign to the word Dillion, in 
place of the old meaning, (1000,000)? or 10”, the new meaning 
of 10°4 The words trillion, quadrillion, ete., receive the new 
definitions of 10", 10", ete. At the present time the words 
billion, trillion, etc., mean in France, in other south-European 
countries, and in the United States (since the first quar-

ter of this century), 10°, 10”, etc.; while in Germany, Eng- 
land, and other north-European countries they mean 10”, 
10%, ete. 
From what has been said it appears that, while the Arabic 
notation of integral numbers was brought to perfection by the 
Hindus as early as the ninth century, (our present numeration 
dates from the close of the fifteenth century. fore of the 
advantages of the Arabic notation is its independence of its 
numeration. At present the numeration, though practically 
adequate, is not fully developed. To read a number of, say, 
1000 digits, or to read the value of 7, calculated to 707 
decimal places by William Shanks, we should have to invent 
new words. 
A good numeration, accompanied by a good notation, is 
essential for proficient work in numbers. We are told that 
the Yancos on the Amazon could not get beyond the number 
three, because they could not express that idea by any phrase- 
ology more simple than Poettarrarorincoaroac.t 
As regards arithmetical operations, it is of interest to notice 
that the Hindu custom was introduced into Europe, of begin- 
ning an addition or subtraction, sometimes from the right, 
but more commonly from the left. Notwithstanding the in- 
convenience of this latter procedure, it is found in Europe 
as late as the end of the sixteenth century.’ 
Like the Hindus, the Italians used many different methods 
in the multiplication of numbers. An extraordinary passion 
seems to have existed among Italian practitioners of arith- 
metic, at this time, for inventing new forms. Pacioli and 
Tartaglia speak slightingly of these efforts.® Pacioli himself 
gives eight methods and illustrates the first, named’ bericuocoli 
or scacherii, by the first example given here :4

-The second method, for some unknown reason called castel- 
lucio, i.e. “by the little castle,” is shown here in the second 
example. The third method (not illustrated here) invokes 
the aid of tables; the fourth, crocetta sine casella, i.e. “by 
cross multiplication,’ though harder than the others, was 
practised by the Hindus (named by them the “lightning” 
method), and greatly admired by Pacioli. See our third 
example, in which the product is built up as follows: 
3-6410(8-1+4+5-6)+4+100(8-445-142-6) 
+1000 (5-4+4+2-1) + 10,000 (2 - 4). 
Tn Pacioli’s fifth method, quadrilatero, or “by the square,” the 
digits are entered in a square divided up 
z 1 7 \like a chessboard in Hindu fashion, and 
EsS<] are added diagonally. His sixth is called 
gelosia or graticola, i.e. “latticed mul- 
tiplication” (see our fourth example, 
987 x 987). It is so named because the figure looks like a 
lattice or grating, such as was then placed in Venetian 
windows that ladies and nuns might 
not easily be seen from the street.! 
The word gelosia means primarily 
jealousy. The last two of Pacioli’s 
methods are illustrated, respectively, 
by the examples 234 x 48=234 x6 x8 
and 163 x 17 = 163 x 10 + 163 x 7.

  MODERN TIMES 147 
Some books also give the mode of multiplication devised by the 
early Arabs in imitation of one of the Hindu methods. We 
illustrate it in the example! 359 x 837 = 300483. It would be 
erroneous to conclude from the existence of these and other 
methods that all of them were in actual use. As a matter 
of fact the first of Pacioli’s methods (now in common use) 
was the one then practised almost exclusively. 
The second method of Pacioli, illustrated in our 0 ; 
second example, would have been a better choice, 0798 
as we expect to show later. 9672 
It is worthy of remark that the Hindus and 3 ois 
Arabs apparently did not possess a multipli- ee Ceo 35999 
cation table, such, for instance, as the one given 355 
by Boethius,? which was arranged in a square. 3 
We show it here as far as 4x4. The Italians a ousouea 
gave this table in their arithmetics. Another 24 6 8 
form of it, the triangular, shown here as far 36 9 12 
as 4x4, sometimes occurs in arithmetical came 
books. Some writers (for instance, Finaus 1 
in France and Recorde in England) teach also 24 
a kind of complementary multiplication, re- A ‘ee 
sembling a process first found among the 
Romans. It is frequently called the “sluggard’s rule,” and 
was intended to relieve the memory of all products of digits 
exceeding 5. It is analogous to the process in Gerbert’s comple- 
mentary division: “Subtract each digit from 10, and write down 
the differences together, and add as many tens to their 
rae product as the tek i digit exceeds the ei 
Get second first 
difference.”* If a and b designate the digits, then the 
rule rests on the identity (10—a) (10—b)+10(a+b—10) =ab.

148 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
Division was always considered an operation of considerable 
difficulty. Pacioli gives four methods. ‘The first, “division 
by the head,” is used when the divisor consists of one digit or 
two digits (such as 12, 13), included in the Italian tables 
of multiplication.’ In the second, division is performed 
successively by the simple factors of the divisor. The third 
method, “by giving,” is so called because after each subtrac- 
tion we give or add one more figure on the right hand. This 
is the method of “long division” now prevalent. But Pacioli 
expended his enthusiasm on the fourth method, called by the 
Italians the “galley,” because the digits in the completed 
work were arranged in the form of that vessel. He considered 
this procedure the swiftest, just as the galley was the swiftest 
ship. The English call it the scratch method. The complete 
division of 59078 by 74 is shown in Fig. 1.?

10 above, scratch the 59 and also the 7 in the divisor. 7 x 4=28; the 4

  MODERN TIMES 149 
For a long time the galley or scratch method was used almost 
to the entire exclusion of the other methods. As late as the 
seventeenth century it was preferred to the one now in vogue. 
It was adopted in Spain, Germany, and England. It is found 
in the works of Tonstall, Recorde, Stifel, Stevin, Wallis, 
Napier, and Oughtred. Not until the beginning of the 
eighteenth century was it superseded in England.’ It will 
be remembered that the scratch method did not spring into 
existence in the form taught by the writers of the sixteenth 
century. On the contrary, it is simply the graphical repre- 
sentation of the method employed by the Hindus, who caleu- 
lated with a coarse pencil on a small dust-covered tablet. The 
erasing of a figure by the Hindus is here represented by the 
scratching of a figure. On the Hindu tablet, our example, 
taken from Purbach, would have appeared, when completed, 
as follows: 26 
59078 | 798 
74 
The practice of European arithmeticians to prove their 
operations by “casting out the 9’s” was another method, useful 
to the Hindus, but poorly adapted for computation on paper 
or slate, since in this case the entire operation is exhibited at 
the close, and all the steps can easily be re-examined. 
being under the 0 in the dividend, 28 must be subtracted from 100; the 
remainder is 72; scratch the 10, the 0 of the dividend, and the 4 of the 
divisor (Fig. 3) ; above write the 7 and 2. Write down the divisor one 
place further to the right, as in Fig. 4. Now 7 into 72 goes 9 times; 
9x 7=63; 72 —63=9; scratch 72 and the 7 below, write 9 above; 
9 x 4= 36; 97 — 36 = 61; scratch the 9 above, write 6 above it; scratch 
7 in the dividend and write 1 above it ; scratch 7 and 4 below, Fig. 5. Again 
move the divisor one place to the right. It goes 8 times; 7 x 8 = 56; 
61 — 56 =5; scratch 6 and 1 above and write 5 abovel; 8x 4=82; 
58 — 32 = 26; scratch the 5 above and write 2; above the scratched 8 in 
the dividend write 6, Fig. 1. The remainder is 26.

  150 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
As there were two rival methods of division (“by giving” 
and “galley ”), there were also two varieties in the extraction 
of square and cube root.’ In case of surds, great interest was 
taken in the discovery of rules of approximation. Leonardo 
of Pisa, Tartaglia, and others give the Arabic rule (found, for 
instance, in the works of the Arabs, Ibn Albanna and Alkal- 
sdi), which may be expressed in our algebraic symbols thus :? 
Vei—e=a4+. 2a 
This yields the root in excess, while the following Arabic rule 
makes it too small: 
Ve—a@=at   
7 
Similar formule were devised for cube root. 
In other methods of approximation to the roots of surds, the 
idea of decimal fractions makes its first appearance, though 
their true nature and importance were overlooked. About the 
middle of the twelfth century, John of Seville, presumably in 
imitation of Hindu methods, adds 2 ciphers to the number, 
then finds the square root, and takes this as a numerator of a 
fraction whose denominator is 1, followed by n ciphers. The 
“same method was followed by Cardan,-but it failed to be gen- 
erally adopted, even by his Italian contemporaries; for other- 
wise it certainly would have been at least mentioned by 
Cataldi (died 1626) in a work devoted exclusively to the ex- 
traction of roots. Cataldi finds the square root by means of 
continued fractions—a method ingenious and novel, but for 
practical purposes inferior to Cardan’s. Orontius Finzeus, in 
France, and William Buckley (died about 1550), in England,

MODERN TIMES 151 
extracted the square root in the same way as Cardan. In 
finding the square root of 10, Finzus adds six ciphers, and 
10000000( 3 | 162 concludes as poo ENG. The 3| 162 expresses 
ee the square root in decimals. A new branch

_60 stared him in the face, as it had many of 
43/200 his predecessors and contemporaries! But he 
80 sees it not; he is thinking of sexagesimal 
Pa fractions, and hastens to reduce the frac- 
tional part to sexagesimal divisions of an integer,! thus, 
3-9'.43".12'". What was needed for the discovery of deci- 
mals in a case like this? Observation, keen observation. 
And yet certain philosophers would make us believe that 
observation is not needed or developed in mathematical 
study ! 
Close approaches to the discovery of decimals were made in 
other ways. The German Christoff Rudolff performed divis- 
ions by 10, 100, 1000, etc., by cutting off by a comma (“mit 
einer virgel”)? as many digits as there are zeros in the 
divisor. 
The honour of the invention of decimal fractions belongs to 
Simon Stevin of Bruges in Belgium (1548-1620), a man 
remarkable for his varied attainments in science, for his inde- 
pendence of thought, and extreme lack of respect for authority. 
It would be interesting to know exactly how he came upon his 
great discovery. In 1584 he published in Flemish (later in 
French) an interest table. “TI hold it now next to certain,” 
says De Morgan,’ “that the same convenience which has 
always dictated the decimal form for tables of compound 
interest was the origin of decimal fractions themselves.” In 
1585 Stevin published his La Disme (the fourth part of a

  152 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
French work on mathematics), covering only seven pages, in 
which decimal fractions are explained. He recognized the 
full importance of decimal fractions, and applied them to all 
the operations of ordinary arithmetic. No invention is per- 
fect at its birth. Stevin’s decimal fractions lacked a suitable 
notation. In place of our decimal point, he used a cipher; to 
each place in the fraction was attached the corresponding 
index. Thus, in his notation, the number 5.912 would be 
5912 or 5@9@1@2®. These indices, though cumbrous, are 
interesting because herein we shall find the principle of 
another important innovation made by Stevin—an exponen- 
tial notation. As an illustration of Stevin’s notation, we- 
append the following division.’ 
OHHH. We He was enthusiastic, not only over 
ae ea decimal fractions, but also over the 
decimal division of weights and 
measures. He considered it the 
duty of governments to establish 
Zz 3 @ 8 ? the latter. As to decimals, he 
says, that, while their introduction 
may be delayed, “it is certain 
that if the nature of man in the future remains the same as 
it is now, then he will not always neglect so great an advan- 
tage.” His decimals met with ready, though not immediate, 
recognition. His La Disme was translated into English in 
1608 by Richard Norton. A decimal arithmetic was published 
in London, 1619, by Henry Lyte.? As to weights and measures, 
little did Stevin suspect that two hundred years would elapse 
before the origin of the metric system; and that at the close 
of the nineteenth century England and the New World would 
still be hopelessly bound by the chains of custom to the use QeRN AH

of yards, rods, and avoirdupois weights. But we still hope that 
the words of John Kersey may not be proved prophetic: “It 
being improbable that such a Reformation will ever be brought 
to pass, I shall proceed in directing a Course to the Studious 
for obtaining the frugal Use of such decimal fractions as are 
in his Powers.” ? 
After Stevin, decimals were used on the continent by Joost 
Biirgi, a Swiss by birth, who prepared a manuscript on arith- 
metic soon after 1592, and by Johann Hartmann Beyer, who 
assumes the invention as his own. In 1603 he published at 
Frankfurt on the Main a Logistica Decimalis. With Burgi, a 
zero placed underneath the digit in unit’s place answers as a 
sign of separation. Beyer’s notation resembles Stevin’s, but 
it may have been suggested to him by the sexagesimal notation 
then prevalent. He writes 123.459872 thus: 
I WI Iv Vv VI 
123.4.5.9.8.7- 2, 
Again he writes .000054 thus, 5A, and remarks that these 
differ from other fractions in having the denominator written 
above the numerator. The decimal point, says Peacock, is 
due to Napier, who in 1617 published his Rabdologia con- 
taining a treatise on decimals, wherein the decimal point is 
used in one or two instances. In the English translation of 
Napier’s Descriptio, executed by Edward Wright in 1616, and 
corrected by the author, the decimal point occurs on the first 
page of logarithmic tables. There is no mention of decimals 
in English arithmetics between 1619 and 1631. Oughtred, in 
1631, designates .56 thus, 0|56. Albert Girard, a pupil of 
Stevin, in 1629 uses the point on one occasion. John Wallis, 
in 1657, writes 12 |345, but afterwards in his algebra adopts the

quotes the same passage from the 2d Ed., 1668.

usual point. Georg Andreas Bockler, in his Arithmetica nova, 
Nurnberg, 1661, uses the comma in place of the point (as do 
the Germans at the present time), but applies decimals only to 
the measurement of lengths, surfaces, and solids.!_ De Morgan? 
says that “it was long before the simple decimal point was 
fully recognized in all its uses, in England at least, and on 
the continent the writers were rather behind ours in this 
matter. As long as Oughtred was widely used, that is, till 
the end of the seventeenth century, there must have been a 
large school of those who were trained to the notation 123 [456. 
To the first quarter of the eighteenth century, then, we must 
refer, not only the complete and final victory of the decimal 
point, but also that of the now universal method of performing 
the operation of division and extraction of the square root.” 
The progress of the decimal notation, and of all other, 
is interesting and instructive. “The history of language .. . 
is of the highest order of interest, as well as utility; its sug- 
gestions are the best lesson for the future which a reflecting 
mind can have.” (De Morgan.) 
To many readers it will doubtless seem that after the 
Hindu notation was brought to perfection probably in the 
ninth century, decimal fractions should have arisen at once 
in the minds of mathematicians, as an obvious extension of it. 
But*® “it is curious to think how much science had attempted 
in physical research, and how deeply numbers had been pon- 
dered before it was perceived that the all-powerful simplicity 
of the ‘Arabic Notation’ was as valuable and as manageable 
in an infinitely descending as in an infinitely ascending pro- 
gression.” 
The experienced teacher has again and again made observa-

tions similar to this, on the development of thought, in watch- 
ing the progress of his pupils. The mind of the pupil, like 
the mind of the investigator, is bent upon the attainment of 
some fixed end (the solution of a problem), and any con- 
sideration not directly involved in this immediate aim 
frequently escapes his vision. Persons looking for some 
particular flower often fail to see other flowers, no matter 
how pretty. One of the objects of a successful mathematical 
teacher, as of a successful teacher in natural science, should 
be to habituate students to keep a sharp lookout for other 
things, besides those primarily sought, and to make these, too, 
subjects of contemplation. Such a course develops investi- 
gators, original workers. 
The miraculous powers of modern calculation are due to 
three inventions: the Hindu Notation, Decimal Fractions, and 
Logarithms. The invention of logarithms, in the first quarter of 
the seventeenth century, was admirably timed, for Kepler was 
then examining planetary orbits, and Galileo had just turned 
the telescope to the stars. During the latter part of the fit- 
teenth and during the sixteenth century, German mathema- 
ticians had constructed trigonometrical tables of great accuracy, 
but this greater precision enormously increased the work of the 
calculator. It is no exaggeration to say with Laplace that the 
invention of logarithms “by shortening the labours doubled 
the life of the astronomer.” Logarithms were invented by 
John Napier, Baron of Merchiston, in Scotland (1550-1617). 
At the age of thirteen, Napier entered St. Salvator College, 
St. Andrews. An uncle once wrote to Napier’s father, “I 
pray you, Sir, to send John to the schools either of France 
or Flanders, for he can learn no good at home.” So he was 
sent abroad. In 1574 a beautiful castle was completed for 
him on the banks of the Endrick. On the opposite side of 
the river was a lint mill, and its clack greatly disturbed

Napier. He sometimes desired the miller to stop the mill 
so that the train of his ideas might not be interrupted.’ In 
1608, at the death of his father, he took possession of Mer 
chiston castle. 
Napier was an ardent student of theology and astrology,? 
and delighted to show that the pope was Antichrist. More 
worthy of his genius were his mathematical studies, which he 
pursued as pastime for over forty years. Some of his mathe- 
matical fragments were published for the first time in 1839. 
The great object of his mathematical studies was the simpli- 
fying and systematizing of arithmetic, algebra, and trigo- 
nometry. Students in trigonometry remember “ Napier’s 
analogies,” and “Napier’s rule of circular parts,” for the solu- 
tion of spherical right triangles. This is, .perhaps, “the 
happiest example of artificial memory that is known.” In 
1617 was published his Rabdologia, containing “Napier’s 
rods” or “bones”* and other devices designed to simplify 
multiplication and division. This work was well known on 
the continent, and for a time attracted even more attention 
than his logarithms. As late as 1721 E. Hatton, in his arith-

metic, takes pains to explain multiplication, division, and 
evolution by “Neper’s Bones or Rods.” 
His logarithms were the result of prolonged, unassisted 
and isolated speculation. Nowadays we usually say that, in 
n= b*, wis the logarithm of 7 to the base b. But in the time 
of Napier our exponential notation was not yet in vogue. 
The attempts to introduce exponents, made by Stifel and 
Stevin, were not yet successful, and Harriot, whose algebra 
appeared long after Napier’s death, knew nothing of indices. 
It is one of the greatest curiosities of the history of science 
that Napier constructed logarithms before exponents were 
used. That logarithms flow naturally from the exponential 
symbol was not observed until much later by Euler.’ What, 
then, was Napier’s line of thought ? 
Let AE be a definite line, A'D! a line extending from A! 
indefinitely. Imagine two points starting at the same moment; 
the one moving from A 
AS SB C2D) E toward Z, the other from =~——*++——_________; 
A' along A'D'. Let the 
velocity during the feat 
moment be the same for 
both. Let that of the point on line A'D' be uniform; but 
the velocity of the point on AH decreasing in such a way 
that when it arrives at any point C, its velocity is proportional 
to the remaining distance CE. If the first point moves along 
a distance AC, while the second one moves over a distance 
A'C', then Napier calls A'C' the logarithm of CE. 
This process appears strange to the modern student. Let 
us develop the theory more fully. Assume a very large initial 
velocity = AH = (say) v. Then, during every successive short 
interval or moment of time, measured approximately by 5 the

lower point will travel approximately unit distance, which is 
the product of the uniform velocity v and the time i (nearly). » 
The upper point, starting likewise with a velocity v= AE, 
travels during the first moment very nearly unit’s distance

The second series represents at the end of corresponding 
intervals of time very nearly the distances of D' from A’. 
According to Napier, the numbers in the lower series are ap- 
proximately the logarithms of the corresponding numbers in 
the upper series. Now observe that the lower series is an 
arithmetical progression and the upper a geometrical progres- 
sion. It is here that Napier’s discovery comes in touch with 
the work of previous investigators, like Archimedes and Stifel ; 
it is here that the continuity between the old and the new 
exists. F 
The relation between numbers and their logarithms, which
-P-A-G-E-167
  
  MODERN TIMES 159 
is indicated by the above series, is found, of course, in the loga- 
rithms now in general use. The numbers in the geometric 
series, 1, 10, 100, 1000, have for their common logarithms (to 
the base 10), the numbers in the arithmetic series, 0, 1, 2, 3. 
But observe one very remarkable peculiarity of Napier’s log- 
arithms: they increase as the numbers themselves decrease 
and numbers exceeding v have negative logarithms. More 
over, zero is the logarithm, not of unity (as in modern log- 
arithms), but of v, which was taken by Napier equal to 10". 
Napier calculated the logarithms, not of successive integral 
numbers, from 1 upwards, but of sines. His aim was to sim- 
plify trigonometric computations. The line AZ was the sine 
of 90° (i.e. of the radius) and was taken equal to 10’ units. 
BE, CE, DE, were sines of arcs, and A'B', A'C’, A'D' their 
respective logarithms. It is evident from what has been 
said that the logarithms of Napier are not the same as 
the natural logarithms to the base e=2.718---. This dif- 
ference must be emphasized, because it is not uncommon 
for text-books on algebra to state that the natural logarithms 
were invented by Napier.’ The relation existing between 
natural logarithms and those of Napier is expressed by the 
formula,’

It must be mentioned that Napier did not determine the

tury were the first to point out this difference, it is curious to find in 
Brockhaus’ Konversations Lexikon (1894), article ‘‘ Logarithmus,”’ the 
statement that Napier invented natural logarithms. For references to 
articles by early writers pointing out this error, consult Dr. S. GinTHEr,

base to his system of logarithms. The notion of a “base” 
not only never suggested itself to him, but in fact is inapplica- 
ble to his system, unless it is modified somewhat.' 
Napier’s great invention was given to the world in 1614, in 
a work entitled, Mirifici logarithmorum canonis descriptio2 In 
it he explained the nature of logarithms, and gave a logarith- 
mic table of the natural sines of a quadrant from minute to 
minute. In 1619 appeared Napier’s Mirifici logurithmorum 
canonis constructio, as a posthumous work,’ in which his 
method of calculating logarithms is explained. The follow- 
1 That the notion of a “ base’? may become applicable, it is necessary 
that zero be the logarithm of 1 and not of 107. This relation log 1 =0 
is obtained approximately if each term of Napier’s geometric series and 
each term of his arithmetic series is divided by v or 10’. This gives us

here modified, is the reciprocal of the base in the natural system. 
2 From a note at the end of the table of logarithms: ‘‘ Since the calcu- 
lation of this table, which ought to have been accomplished by the labour 
and assistance of many computors, has been completed by the strength 
and industry of one alone, it will not be surprising if many errors have 
crept into it.’? The table is remarkably accurate, as fewer errors have 
been found than might be expected. See Naprer’s Construction (Mac- 
DONALD’s Ed.), pp. 87, 90-96.

At the bottom of the first page in the Descriptio, on the 
right, is the figure “89,” for 89°. In the columns marked 
“sinus,” we have here copied the natural sines of 0°, 0 to 5 
minutes, and of 89°, 55 to 60 minutes. In the columns marked 
“logarithmi,” are the logarithms of these sines, and in the 
column “differentiee ” the differences between the logarithmic 
figures in the two columns. Since sina = cos (90 —2), this 
semi-quadrantal arrangement of the tables really gives all the 
cosines of angles and their logarithms. Thus, log cos 0° 5! 
= 11 and log cos 89° 55' = 65331315. Moreover, since log tan « 
= — log cot a= log sina — log cos x, the column marked “ differ- 
entie” gives the logarithmic tangents, if taken +, and the 
logarithmic cotangents if taken —. 
Napier’s logarithms met with immediate appreciation both 
in England and on the continent. Henry Briggs (15561-1630), 
who in Napier’s time was professor of geometry in Gresham 
College, London, and afterwards professor at Oxford, was 
struck with admiration for the book. “Neper, lord of Mark-

inston, hath set my head and hands at work with his new and 
admirable logarithms. I hope to see him this summer, if it 
please God, for I never saw a book which pleased me better 
and made me more wonder.” Briggs was an able mathe- 
matician, and was one of the few men of that time who did 
not believe in astrology. While Napier was a great lover of 
this pseudo-science, “ Briggs was the most satirical man against 
it that hath been known,” calling it “a system of groundless 
conceits.” ‘Briggs left his studies in London to do homage 
to the Scottish philosopher. The scene at their meeting is 
interesting. Briggs was delayed in his journey, and Napier 
complained to a°common friend, “Ah, John, Mr. Briggs will 
. not come.” At that very moment knocks were heard at the 
gate, and Briggs was brought into the lord’s chamber. Almost 
one-quarter of an hour went by, each beholding the other 
without speaking a word. At last Briggs began: “My lord, 
I have undertaken this long journey purposely to see your 
person, and to know by what engine of wit or ingenuity you 
came first to think of this most excellent help in astronomy, 
viz. the logarithms; but, my lord, being by you found out, I 
wonder nobody found it out before, when now known it is 
so easy.”! Briggs suggested to Napier the advantage that 
would result from retaining zero for the logarithm of the . 
whole sine, but choosing 10’ for the logarithm of the tenth ~ 
part of that same sine, i.e. of 5°44'22". Napier said that he 
had already thought of the change, and he pointed out a 
slight improvement on Briggs’s idea; viz. that zero should be 
the logarithm of 1, and 10’ that of the whole sine, thereby 
making the characteristic of numbers greater than unity 
positive and not negative, as suggested by Briggs. Briggs 
admitted this to be more convenient. The invention of “ Brig-

gian logarithms” occurred, therefore, to Briggs and Napier 
independently. The great practical advantage of the new 
system was that its fundamental progression was accommo- 
dated to the base, 10, of our numerical scale. Briggs devoted 
all his energies to the construction of tables upon the new 
plan. Napier died in 1617, with the satisfaction of having 
found in Briggs an able friend to bring to completion his 
unfinished plans. In 1624 Briggs published his Arithmetica 
logarithmica, containing the logarithms to 14 places of num- 
bers, from 1 to 20,000 and from 90,000 to 100,000. The gap 
from 20,000 to 90,000 was filled by that illustrious suc- 
cessor of Napier and Briggs, Adrian Viacg, of Gouda in 
Holland. He published in 1628 a table of logarithms from 
1 to 100,000, of which 70,000 were calculated by himself. 
The first publication of Briggian logarithms of trigonometric 
functions was made in 1620 by Edmund Gunter, a colleague 
of Briggs, who found the logarithmic sines and tangents for 
every minute to seven places. Gunter was the inventor of 
the words cosine and cotangent. Briggs devoted the last years 
of his life to caleulating more extensive Briggian logarithms 
of trigonometric functions, but he died in 1630, leaving his 
work unfinished. It was carried on by the English Henry 
Gellibrand, and then published by Vlacq at his own expense. 
Briggs divided a degree into 100 parts, but owing to the 
publication by Vlacq of trigonometrical tables constructed 
on the old sexagesimal division, the innovation of Briggs 
remained unrecognized. Briggs and Vlacq published four 
fundamental works, the results of which “have never been 
superseded by any subsequent calculations.”

164 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
We have pointed out that the logarithms published by 
Napier are not the same as our natural logarithms. The first 
appearance of natural logarithms (with the decimal point 
omitted) is in an anonymous Appendix printed in the 1618 
edition of Edward Wright’s translation of Napier’s Descriptio. 
This interesting Appendix explains methods of interpolation 
and is very probably written by William Oughtred. These 
interpolations were effected with the aid of a small table con- 
taining the logarithms of 72 sines. In it, log 10 is given as 
230 2584. In modern notation, log, 10 = 2.302584. 
It is frequently stated that natural logarithms appear in the 
New Logarithmes, published at London by a London teacher of 
mathematics, John Speidell, in the year 1619. The book con- 
tains logarithms of sines, tangents, and secants. These are not 
quite the natural logarithms, on account of complications aris- 
ing from the fact that the logarithms appear in the tables as 
integral numbers and also that the natural functions (not 
printed by Speidell) were taken as integral numbers. Thus, 
Napier gives sin 30’ = 87265, the radius being 10’. In reality, 
sin 30’ = .0087265. The natural logarithm of this fraction is 
approximately 5.25861. Adding 10 gives 5.25861. Speidell 
writes in his tables, log sin 30’ = 525 861. The relation be- 
tween the natural logarithms and the logarithms in Speidell’s 
trigonometric tables is shown by the formula, Sp. log «= 
10%(210 + log, my For secants and the latter half of the tan- 
gents the addition of 10 is omitted. In Speidell’s table log 
tan 89° = 404 812, the natural logarithm of tan 89° being 
4.04812.

-P-A-G-E-173
  
  MODERN TIMES 165 
From Speidell’s statements it is evident that no theoretical, 
but purely practical reasons induced him to modify Napier’s 
tables. He desired to simplify logarithms, so that persons 
ignorant of the algebraic rules of addition and subtraction 
could use the tables. His tables of 1619 avoid negative num- 
bers, but the important adaptation to the Arabic Notation, 
brought about in the Briggian system, escaped him. His son, 
Euclid Speidell, says that he “at last concluded that the deci- 
mal or Briggs’ logarithms were the best sort for a standard 
logarithm.” Editions of Speidell’s book appear to have been 
issued in 1620, 1621, 1623, 1624, 1627, 1628, but not all by 
himself. In his “ Briefe Treatise of Sphericall Triangles” he 
mentions and complains of those who had printed his work 
without an atom of alteration and yet, dispraised it in their 
prefaces for want of alterations. To them he says: 
“Tf that thou canst amend it 
So shall the arte increase : 
If thou canst not: commend it, 
Else, preethee hould thy peace.’’ 
This unfair treatment of himself Speidell attributes to his 
not having been at Oxford or Cambridge — “not hauing seene 
one of the Vniuersities.” 
In the edition of 1622 of his New Logarithmes, Speidell pub- 
lished also logarithms of the numbers 1-1000; these are genu- 
inely natural logarithms, except for the omission of the deci- 
mal point. We have mentioned the very small table of 1618, 
which contains 72 logarithms. Speidell’s is the earliest more 
extensive printed table of natural numbers. There is a column 
in the table which shows that he means to use his table in cal- 
culations by feet, inches, and quarters. Thus the number 775 
has 16-1-3 opposite to it, there being 775 quarter inches in 
16 feet 1 inch, 3 quarters. This is an interesting example of 
the efforts made from time to time to partially overcome the
-P-A-G-E-174
166 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
inconvenience arising from the use of different scales in the 
system of measures from that of our notation of numbers. At 
the bottom of each page Speidell inserts the logarithms of 100 
and 1000 for use in decimal fractions. 
The most elaborate system of natural logarithmic tables is 
Wolfram’s, which practically gives natural logarithms of all 
numbers from 1 to 10,000 to 48 decimal places. They were 
published in 1778 in J. C. Schulze’s Sammlung.! Wolfram 
was a Dutch lieutenant of artillery and his table represents 
six years of very toilsome work. The most complete table of 
natural logarithms, as regards range, was published by the 
German lightning calculator Zacharias Dase, at Vienna, in 
1850. A table is found also in Rees’s Cyclopedia (1819), 
article, “ Hyperbolic Logarithms.” 
In view of the fact that all early efforts were bent, not 
toward devising logarithms beautiful and simple in theory, but 
logarithms as useful as possible in computation, it is curious 
to see that the earliest systems are comparatively weak in 
practical adaptation, although of great theoretical interest. 
Napier almost hit upon -natural logarithms, whose modulus 
is unity, while Speidell luckily found the nugget. 
The only possible rival of John Napier in the invention of 
logarithms was the Swiss Joost Biirgi or Justus Byrgius 
(1552-1632). In his youth a watchmaker, he afterwards was 
at the observatory in Kassel, and at Prague with Kepler. He 
was a mathematician of power, but could not bring himself to 
publish his researches. ‘Kepler attributes to him the discovery 
of decimal fractions and of logarithms. Birgi published a 
erude table of logarithms six years after the appearance of 
Napier’s Descriptio, but it seems that he conceived the idea 
and constructed that table as early, if not earlier, than Napier 
1 Article ‘‘ Tables” in the English Cyclopedia.
-P-A-G-E-175
MODERN TIMES 167 
did his. However, he neglected to have the results published 
until after Napier’s logarithms (largely through the influence 
of Kepler) were known and admired throughout Europe. 
The methods of computing logarithms adopted by Napier, 
Briggs, Kepler, Vlacq, are arithmetical and deducible from the 
doctrine of ratios. After the large logarithmic tables were 
once computed, writers like Gregory St. Vincent, Newton, 
Nicolaus Mercator, discovered that these computations can be 
performed much more easily with aid of infinite series. In 
the study of quadratures, Gregory St. Vincent (1584-1667) in 
1647 found the grand property of the equilateral hyperbola 
which connected the hyperbolic space between the asymptotes 
with the natural logarithms, and led to these logarithms being 
called “hyperbolic.” By this property, Nicolaus Mercator in 
1668 arrived at the logarithmic series, and showed how the 
construction of logarithmic tables could be reduced by series 
to the quadrature of hyperbolic spaces.? 
English Weights and Measures 
At as late a period as the sixteenth century, the condition of 
commerce in England was very low. Owing to men’s ignorance 
of trade and the general barbarism of the times, interest on 
money in the thirteenth century mounted to an enormous rate. 
Instances occur of 50 % rates. But in course of the next two 
centuries a reaction followed. Not only were extortions of 
this sort prohibited by statute, but, in the reign of Henry VII., 
severe laws were made against taking any interest whatever,

  168 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
all interest being then denominated usury. That commerce 
did not flourish under these new conditions is not strange. 
But after the middle of the sixteenth century we find that 
the invidious word usury came to be confined to the taking of 
exorbitant or illegal interest; 10% was permitted. What 
little trade existed up to this time was carried on mainly by 
merchants of the Hansa Towns— Easterlings as they were 
called. 
But in the latter half of the fifteenth century the use of 
gunpowder was introduced, the art of printing invented, 
America discovered. The pulse and pace of the world began 
to quicken. Even in England the wheels of commerce were 
gradually set in motion. In the sixteenth century English 
commerce became brisk. Need was felt of some preparation 
for business careers. Arithmetic and book-keeping were 
introduced into Great Britain. 
Questions pertaining to money, weights and measures must 
of necessity have received some attention even in a semi-civ- 
ilized community. In attempting to sketch their history, we 
find not only in weights and measures, but also in English 
coins, traces of Roman influence. The Saxons improved 
Roman coinage. That of William the Conqueror was appar- 
ently on the plan adopted by Charlemagne in the eighth 
century and is supposed to be derived from the Romans as 
regards the division of the pound into 20 shillings and the 
shilling into 12 pence. The same proportions were preserved 
in the lira of Italy, libra of Spain, and livre of France, all 
now obsolete. The pound adepted by William the Conqueror 
was the Saxon Moneyer’s or Tower pound of 5400 grains.’

Much of our information regarding English money, weights, and meas- 
ures is derived from this work.
-P-A-G-E-177
    MODERN TIMES 169 
Notice that the vegetable kingdom supplied the primary unit of 
mass, the “grain.” A pound in weight and a pound in tale (that 
is, inreckoning) were the same. An amount of silver weighing 
one pound was taken to be worth one pound in money. This 
explains the double meaning of the word “pound,” first as a 
weight-unit, secondly as a money-unit. Later the Troy pound 
(5760 grains) came to be used for weighing precious metals. 
A Troy pound of silver would therefore contain 214 of the 
shillings mentioned above. Between the thirteenth century 
and the beginning of the sixteenth the shilling was reduced 
to } its ancient weight. A change of this sort would probably 
have been disastrous, except for the practice which appears to 
have been observed, of paying by weight and not by tale. If 
we except one short period, we may say that the new shilling 
was permitted to vary but little in its fineness. In 1665, in 
the reign of Charles II., a Troy pound of silver yielded 62 
shillings, in 1816 it yielded 66 shillings.‘ A financial expe- 
dient sometimes resorted to by governments was the deprecia- 
tion of the currency, by means of issues of coin which contained 
much less silver or gold than older coins, but which had nomi- 
“nally the same value. This was tried by Henry VIII., who 
issued money in which the silver was reduced in amount by 4, 
later 4, and finally 2. In the reign of Edward VL., the amount 
of silver was reduced by 3, so that a coin contained only } the 
old amount of silver. Seventeen years after the first of these 
issues Queen Elizabeth called in’ the base coin and put money 
of the old character in circulation. Henry VIII.’s experiment 
was disastrous, and reduced England “from the position of a 
first rate to that of a third rate power in Europe for more than 
a century.” ?

  170 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
Interesting are the etymologies of some of the words used 
in connection with English money. The name sterling seems 
to have been introduced through the Hansa merchants in 
London. “In the time of . . . King Richard I., monie coined 
in the east parts of Germanie began to be of especiall request 
in England for the puritie thereof, and was called Hasterling 
monie, as all the inhabitants of those parts were called Haster- 
lings, and shortly after some of that countrie, skillful in mint 
matters, . . . were sent for into this realme to bring the coine 
to perfection; which since that time was called of them sterling, 
for Easterling” (Camden). In the early coinages the silver 
penny or sterling was minted with a deep cross. When it was 
broken into four parts, each was called a fowrth-ing or farthing, 
the ing being a diminutive. Larger silver pieces of four pence 
were first coined in the reign of Edward III. They were 
called greats or groats. In 1663, in the reign of Charles IL., 
new gold coins were issued, 444 pieces to one Troy pound of 
the metal. These were called guineas, after the new country 
on the west coast of Africa whence the gold was brought. 
The guinea varied in its current price from 20 shillings up to 
30, until the year 1717, when, on Sir Isaac Newton’s recom- 
mendation, it was fixed at 21 shillings, its present value.” 
The history of measures of weight brings out the curious 
fact that among the Hindus and Egyptians, as well as Italians, 
English, and other Europeans, the basis for the unit of weight 
lay usually in the grain of barley. This was also a favourite 
unit of length. The lowest subdivision of the pound, or of 
1 Tuomas Ditworrtu in his Schoolmaster’s Assistant, 1784 (first edition 
about 1743) praises English gold as follows, p. 89: ‘In England, Sums of 
Mony are paid in the best Specie, viz., Guineas, by which Means 1000 1 
or more may be put into a small Bag, and conveyed away in the Pocket ; 
but in Sweden they often pay Sums of Mony in Copper, and the Mer- 
chant is obliged to send Wheelbarrows instead of Bags to receive it.’?

MODERN TIMES 171 
other similar units, was usually defined as weighing the same 
as a certain number of grains of barley. That no great degree 
of accuracy could be secured and maintained on such a basis 
is evident. The fact that the writings of Greek physicians 
were widely studied, led to the general adoption in Europe 
of the Greek subdivisions of the litra or pound. The pound 
contained 12 ounces; the lower subdivisions being the drachm 
or dram (“a handful”), the gramma (“a small weight”), and 
the grain.’ The Romans translated gramma into scriptulum 
or serupulum, which word has come down to us as “scruple.” 
The word gramme has been adopted into the metric system. 
The Greeks had a second pound of 16 ounces, called mina. 
The subdivision of pounds both duodecimally and according 
to the fourth power of two is therefore of ancient date. 
During the Middle Ages there was in Europe an almost 
endless variety of different sizes of the pound, as also of the 
foot, but the words “pound” and “foot” were adopted by all 
languages; thus pointing to a common origin of the measures. 
The various pounds were usually divided into 16 ounces; 
sometimes into 12. The word “pound” comes from the Latin 
pondus. The word “ounce” is the Latin uncia, meaning “a 
twelfth part.” The words “ounce” and “inch” have one 
common derivation, the former being called uncia libre (libra, 
pound), and the latter uncia pedis (pes, foot).? 
On English standards of weights and measures there existed 
(we are told by an old bishop) good laws before the Conquest, 
but the laws then, as subsequently, were not well observed. 
The Saxon Tower pound was retained by William the Con- 
queror, and served at first both as monetary and as weight 
unit. There have been repeated alterations in the size of the 
pounds in use in England. Moreover, several different kinds

172 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
were in use for different, purposes at one and the same time. 
The first serious attention to this subject seems to have been 
given in 1266, statute 51 Henry III., when, “by the consent of 
the whole realm of England .. . an English penny, called a 
sterling, round and without any clipping, shall weigh 32 wheat 
corns in the midst of the ear, and 20 pence do make an ounce, 
and 12 ounces one pound, and 8 pounds do make a gallon of 
wine, and 8 gallons of wine do make a London bushel, which 
is the eighth part of a quarter.” According to this statement, 
the pound consisted of, and was determined by, the weight of 
7680 grains of wheat. Moreover, silver coin was apparently 
taken by weight, and not by tale. No doubt this was a 
grievance, when the standard of weight was so ill-established. 
The pound defined above we take to be the same as the Tower 
pound. In 1527, statute 18 Henry VIII., the Tower pound, 
which had been used mostly for the precious metals, was 
abolished, and the Troy established in its place. The earliest 
statute mentioning the Troy pound is one of 1414, 2 Henry V.; 
how much earlier it was used is a debated question. The old 
Tower pound was equivalent to 4% of the Troy. The name 
Troy is generally supposed to be derived from Troyes in 
France, where a celebrated fair was formerly held, and the 
pound was used. The English Committee (of 1758) on 
Weights and Measures were of the opinion that Troy came 
from the monkish name given to London of Troy-novant, 
founded on the legend of Brute.1 According to this, Troy 
1 According to mythological history, Brute was a descendant of Aneas 
of ancient Troy, and having inadvertently killed his father, fled to Britain, 
founded London, and called it Troy-novant (New Troy). Spenser writes, 
‘* Faery Queen”? III., 9,

And Troy-novant was built of old Troyes ashes cold.

weight means “London weight.” At about the same period, per- 
haps, the avoirdupois weight was established for heavy goods. 
The name is commonly supposed to be derived from the French 
avoir-du-pois, a corrupt spelling introduced for avoir-de-pois, 
and signifying “goods of weight.” In the earliest statutes 
in which the word avoirdupois is used (9 Edward IIT., in 1335; 
and 27 Edward III., in 1353), it is applied to the goods them- 
selves, not to a system of weights. The latter statute says, 
“Forasmuch as we have heard that some merchants purchase 
avoirdupois woollens and other merchandise by one weight 
and sell by another, . . . we therefore will and establish that 
one weight, one measure, and one yard be throughout the land, 
. and that woollens and all manner of avoirdupois be 
weighed... .” In 1532, 24 Henry VIII., it was decreed that 
“beef, pork, mutton, and veal shall be sold by weight called 
haverdupois.”* Here the word designates weight. According 
to an anonymous arithmetic of 1596, entitled “The Pathway of 
Knowledge,” the “pound haberdepois is parted into 16 ounces ; 
every ounce-8 dragmes, every dragme 3 scruples, every scruple 
20 grains.” This pound contains the same number (7680) of 
grains as the statute pound of 1266 and the same subdivisions 
of the ounce, drachm, and scruple as our present apothecaries’ 
weight. The number of grains in the pennyweight of the old 
pound was changed from 32 to 24, rendering the number of 
grains in the pound 5760. Why and when this change was 
made we do not know. Cocker, Wingate, etc., say in their 
arithmetics that “32 grains of wheat make 24 artificial grains.” * 
The origin of our apothecaries’ weight, it has been suggested,*

was this: Medicines were dispensed by the old subdivisions of 
the pound (as given in the “Pathway of Knowledge”) and 
continued to be so after the standard pound (with 24 instead 
of 32 grains in the pennyweight), which Queen Elizabeth 
ordered to be deposited in the Exchequer in 1588, supplanted 
the old pound. There appear, thus, to have been two different 
pounds avoirdupois, an old and a new. ‘The new of Queen 
Elizabeth agreed very closely with, and may have originated 
from, an old merchant’s pound.! It must be remarked that 
before the fifteenth century, and even later, the commercial 
weight in England was the Amsterdam weight, which was 
then used in other parts of Europe and in the East and West 
Indies.? In Scotland it has been in partial use as late as our 
century, while in England it held its own until 1815 in 
fixing assize of bread.? This weight tells an eloquent story 
regarding the extent of the Dutch trade of early times. 
Other kinds of pounds are mentioned as in use in Great 
Britain.® Their variety is bewildering and confusing; their 
histories and relative values are very uncertain. In fact a 
pound of the same denomination often had different values 
in different places. The “Pathway of Knowledge,” 1596, 
gives five kinds of pounds as in use: the Tower, the Troy, the 
“haberdepoys,” the subtill, and the foyle. The subtill pound 
was used by assayers; the foyle was ¢ of a Troy and was used 
for gold foil, wire, and for pearls. In case of gold foil and 
wire, the workman probably secured his profit by selling 4 of a 
pound at the price of a pound of bullion. Many varieties of 
measure arose from the practice of merchants, who, instead of

varying the price of a given amount of an article, would vary 
the amount of a given name (the pound, say) at a given price." 
Ancient measures of length were commonly derived from 
some part of the human body. This is seen in cubit (length _ 
of forearm), foot, digit, palm, span, and fathom. Later their ~ ; 
lengths were defined in other ways, as by the width (or length) 
of barley corns, or by reference to some arbitrarily chosen 
standard, carefully preserved by the government. The cubit 
is of much greater antiquity than the foot. It was used by 
the Egyptians, Assyrians, Babylonians, and Israelites. It was 
employed in the construction of the pyramid of Gizeh, per- 
haps 3500 8.c. The foot was used by the Greeks and the 
Romans. The Roman foot (= 11.65 English inches) was some- 
times divided into 12 inches or uncie, but usually into 4 palms 
(breadth of the hand across the middle of the fingers) and 
each palm into 4 finger-breadths. Foot rules found in Roman 
ruins usually give this digital division.? By the Romans, as 
also by the ancient Egyptians, care was taken to preserve the 
standards, but during the Middle Ages there arose great diver- 
sity in the length of the foot. 
As previously stated, the early English, like the Hindus and 
Hebrews, used the barley corn or the wheat corn, in determin- 
ing the standards of length and of weight. If it be true that 
Henry I. ordered the yard to be of the length of his arm, then 
this is an exception. It has been stated that the Saxon yard 
was 39.6 inches, and that, in the year 1101, it was shortened 
by Henry I. to the length of his arm. The earliest English 
statute pertaining to units of length is that of 1324 (17 Edward 
IL.), when it was ordained that “three barley corns, round and 
dry, make an inch, 12 inches one foot, three feet a yard.” 
Here the lengths of the barley corns are taken, while later, in

176 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
the sixteenth century, European writers take the breadth ; thus, 
64 breadths to one “ geometrical ” foot (Clavius). The breadth 
was doubtless more definite than the length, especially as the 
word “round” in the law of 1324 leaves a doubt as to how 
much of the point of the grain should be removed before it can 
be so called. 
It would seem as though uniformity in the standards should 
be desired by all honest men, and yet the British government 
has always experienced great difficulty in enforcing it. To be 
sure, the provisions of law often increased the confusion. 
Thus, in 1437, by statute 15 Henry VL, the alnager, or measurer 
by the ell, is directed “to procure for his own use a cord twelve 
yards twelve inches long, adding a quarter of an inch to each 
quarter of a yard.” This law marks the era when the woollen 
manufacture became important, and the law was intended to 
make certain the hitherto vague custom of allowing the width 
of the thumb on every yard, for shrinkage. In 1487, as if to 
repeal this, it was ordained that “cloths shall be wetted before 
they are measured, and not again stretched.” But in a later 
year the older statute is again followed." 
There was no defined relation between the measures of 
length and of capacity, until 1701. The statute for that year 
declares that “the Winchester bushel shall be round with a 
plane bottom, 18} inches wide throughout, and 8 inches deep.” 
In measures of capacity there was greater diversity than in 
the units of length and weight, notwithstanding the fact that 
in the laws of King Edgar, nearly a century before the Con- 
quest, an injunction was issued that one measure, the Winches- 
ter, should be observed throughout the realm. Heavy fines 
were imposed later for using any except the standard bushel, 
but without avail. The history’ of the wine gallon illustrates

    MODERN TIMES 177 
how standards are in danger of deterioration. By a statute of 
Henry III. there was but one legal gallon—the wine gallon. 
Yet about 1680 it was discovered that for a long time'importers 
of wine paid duties on a gallon of 272 to 282 cu. in., and sold 
the wine by one of capacity varying from 224 to 231 cu. in. 
The British Committee of 1758 on weights and measures 
seemed to despair of success in securing uniformity, saying 
“that the repeated endeavours of the legislature, ever since 
Magna Charta, to compel one weight and one measure through- 
out the realm never having proved effectual, there seems little 
to be expected from reviving means which experience has 
shown to be inadequate.” 
The latter half of the eighteenth and the first part of the 
nineteenth century saw the wide distribution in England of 
standards scientifically defined and accurately constructed. 
Nevertheless, as late as 1871 it was stated in Parliament that 
in certain parts of England different articles of merchandise 
were still sold by different kinds of weights, and that in 
Shropshire there were actually different weights employed 
for the same merchandise on different market-days.' 
The early history of our weights and measures discloses the 
fact that standards have been chosen, as a rule, by the people 
themselves, and that governments stepped in at a later period 
and ordained certain of the measures already in use to be legal, 
to the exclusion of all others. Measures which grow directly 
from the practical needs of the people engaged in certain occu- 
pations have usually this advantage, that they are of conven- 
ient dimensions. The furlong (“furrow-long”) is about the 
average length of a furrow; the gallon and hogshead have 
dimensions which were well adapted for practical use; shoe- 
makers found the barley corn a not unsuitable subdivision of ©   1 Jounson’s Universal Cyclop., Art. ‘‘ Weights and Measures.’

the inch in measuring the length of a foot. A very remark- 
able example of the convenient selection of units is given by 
De Morgan:' That the tasks of those who spin might be cal- 
culated more readily, the sack of wool was made 13 tods of 
28 pounds each, or 364 pounds. Thus, a pound a day was a 
tod a month, and a sack a year. But where are the Sundays 
and holidays? It looks as though the weary “spinster” was 
obliged to put in extra hours on other days, that she might 
secure her holiday. Again, “The Boke of. Measuryng of 
Lande,” by Sir Richarde de Benese (about 1539), suggests to 
De Morgan the following passage: 1 “The acre is four roods, 
each rood is ten daye-workes, each daye-worke four perches. 
So the acre being 40 daye-workes of 4 perches each, and the 
mark 40 groats of 4 pence each, the aristocracy of money and 
that of land understood each other easily.” In a system like 
the French, systematically built up according to the decimal 
scale, simple relations between the units for time, for amount 
of work done, and for earnings, do not usually exist. This 
is the only valid objection which can be urged against a sys- 
tem like the metric. On the other hand, the old system needs 
readjustment of its units every time that some invention brings 
about a change in the mode of working or a saving of time, 
and new units must be invented whenever a new trade springs 
up. Unless this is done, systems on the old plan are, if not 
ten thousand times, seven thousand six hundred forty-seven 
times worse than the metric system. Again, the old mode of 
selecting units leads to endless varieties of units, and to such 
atrocities as 7.92 inches =1 link, 5} yards =1 rod, 16} feet 
=1 pole, 43560 sq. feet = 1 acre, 14 hogshead = 1 punch. 
The advantages secured by having a uniform scale for 
weights and measures, which coincides with that of the Arabic

Notation, are admitted by all who have given the subject due 
consideration. Among early English writers whose names are 
identified with attempted reforms of this sort are Edmund 
Gunter and Henry Briggs, who, for one year, were colleagues 
in Gresham College, London. No doubt they sometimes 
met in conference on this subject. Briggs divided the degree 
into 100, instead of 60, minutes; Gunter divided the chain 
into 100 links, and chose it of such length that “the work be 
more easie in arithmetick; for as 10 to the breadth in chains, 
so the length in chains to the content in acres.” Thus, 75 the 
product of the length and breadth (each expressed in chains) 
of a rectangle gives the area in acres. 
The crowning achievement of all attempts at reform in 
weights and measures is the metric system. It had its origin 
at a time when the French had risen in fearful unanimity, de- 
termined to destroy all their old institutions, and upon the 
ruins of these plant a new order of things. Finally adopted in 
France in 1799, the metric system has during the present 
century displaced the old system in nearly every civilized 
realm, except the English-speaking countries. So easy and 
superior is the system, that no serious difficulty has been en- 
countered in its introduction, wherever the experiment has 
been tried. The most pronounced opposition to it was shown 
by the French themselves. The ease with which the change 
has been made in other countries, in more recent time, is due, 
in great measure, to the fact that, before its adoption, the 
metric system had been taught in many of the schools. 
Rise of the Commercial School of Arithmeticians in England 
Owing to the backward condition of England, arithmetic was 
cultivated but little there before the sixteenth century. In 
the fourteenth century the Hindu numerals began to appear in

Great Britain. A single instance of their use in the thir 
teenth century is found in a document of 1282, where the 
word! trium is written 3um. In 1325 there is a warrant from 
Italian merchants to pay 40 pounds; the body of the docu- 
ment contains Roman numerals, but on the outside is endorsed 
by one of the Italians, 13XG, that is, 1825. The 5 appears in- 
complete and inverted, resembling the old 5 in the Bamberg 
Arithmetic of 1483, and the 5 of the apices of Boethius. The 
2 has a slight resemblance to the 2 in the Bamberg Arith- 
metic. The Hindu numerals of that time were so different 
from those now in use, and varied so greatly in their form, 
that persons unacquainted with their history are apt to make 
mistakes in identifying the digits. A singular practice of 
high antiquity was the use of the old letter } for 5. Curious 
errors sometimes occur in notation. Thus, X2 for 12; XXX1, 
or 301, for 31. The new numerals are not found in the books 
printed by Caxton, but in the Myrrour of the World, issued by 
him in 1480, there is a wood-cut of an arithmetician sitting before 
a table on which are tablets with Hindu numerals upon them. 
The use of Hindu numerals in England in the fifteenth cen- 
tury is rather exceptional. Until the middle of the sixteenth 
century accounts were kept by most merchants in Roman 
numerals. The new symbols did not find widespread accept- 
ance till the publication of English arithmetics began. As in 
Italy, so in England, the numerals were used by mercantile 
houses much earlier than by monasteries and colleges. 
The first important arithmetical work of English authorship 
was published in Latin in 1522 by Cuthbert Tonstall (1474— 
1559). No earlier name is known to us excepting that of 
John Norfolk, who wrote, about? 1340, an inferior treatise on

progressions which was printed in 1445, and reissued by Halli- 
well in his Rara Mathematica, London, 1841. Norfolk con- 
founds arithmetical and geometrical progressions, and confines 
himself to the most elementary considerations: 
Tonstall studied at Oxford, Cambridge, and Padua, and 
drew freely from the works of Pacioli and Regiomontanus. 
Reprints of his arithmetic, De arte supputandi,’ appeared in 
England and France, and yet it seems to have been but little 
known to succeeding English writers.? The author states that 
some years previous he had dealings in money (argentariis) 
and, not to get cheated, had to study arithmetic. He read 
everything on the subject in every language that he knew, and 
spent much time, he says, in licking what he found into shape, 
ad ursi exemplum, as the bear does her cubs. According to 
De Morgan? this book is “decidedly the most classical which 
ever was written on the subject in Latin, both in’ purity of 
style and goodness of matter.” The book is a “farewell to 
the sciences” on the author’s appointment to the bishopric of 
London. A modern critic would say that there is not enough 
demonstration in this arithmetic, but Tonstall is a very Euclid 
by the side of most of his contemporaries. Arithmetical results 
frequently needed, he arranges in tables. Thus, he gives the 
multiplication table in form of a square, also addition, subtrac- 
tion, and division tables, and the cubes of the first 10 numbers. 
For? 2 of 4 of 4 he has the notation 3 3 2 Interesting is 
his discussion of the multiplication of fractions. We must

“multiplication ” in case of fractions, where the product is less 
than the multiplicand. That “multiply” means “increase” 
he proves from the Bible: “Be fruitful and multiply, and re- 
plenish the earth” (Gen. i: 28); “I will multiply thy seed as 
the stars of the heaven” (Gen. xxii: 17). But how is this to 
be reconciled with the product of fractions? In this way: 
the unit in the product is of greater virtue or significance ; 
thus, if 4 and } are the sides of a square, then 4 represents 
the area of the square itself. Later writers encountered the 
- same difficulty, but were not always satisfied with Pacioli’s 
explanation. Tonstall discusses the subject with unusual 
clearness. He takes? x $=, “If! you ask the reason why 
this happens thus, it is this, that if the numerators alone are 
multiplied together the integers appear to be multiplied 
together, and thus the numerator would be increased too 
much. Thus, in the example given, when 2 is multiplied into 
3, the result is 6, which, if nothing more were done, would 
seem to be a whole number; however, since it is not the inte- 
ger 2 that must be multiplied by 3, but 3 of the integer 1 that 
must be multiplied by 3 of it, the denominators of the parts 
are in like manner multiplied together; so that, finally, by the 
division which takes place through multiplication of the de- 
nominators (for by so much as the denominator increases, by 
so much are the parts diminished), the increase of the numer 
ator is corrected by as much as it had been augmented more 
than was right, and by this means it is reduced to its proper 
value.” 
This dispute is instanced by Peacock as a curious example 
of the embarrassment arising when a term, restricted in mean- 
ing, is applied to a general operation, the interpretation of 
which depends upon the kinds of quantities involved. The 
1 We are translating Tonstall’s Latin, quoted by Peacock, p. 439.
-P-A-G-E-191
MODERN TIMES 183 
difficulty which is encountered in multiplication arises also 
in the process of division of fractions, for the quotient is 
larger than the dividend. The explanation of the paradox 
calls for a clear insight into the nature of a fraction. That, 
in the historical development, multiplication and division 
should have been considered primarily in connection with 
integers, is very natural. The same course must be adopted 
in teaching the young. First come the easy but restricted 
meanings of multiplication and division, applicable to whole 
numbers. In due time the successful teacher causes students 
to see the necessity of modifying and broadening the meanings 
assigned to the terms. A similar plan has to be followed in 
algebra in connection with exponents. First there is given an 
easy definition applicable only to positive integral exponents. 
Later, new meanings must be sought for fractional and nega- 
tive exponents, for the student sees at once the absurdity, if 
we say that in «i, @ is taken one-half times as a factor. 
Similar questions repeatedly arise in algebra. 
Of course, Tonstall gives the English weights and meas- 
ures ; he also compares English money with the French, etc. 
It is worthy of remark that Tonstall, to prevent Tyndale’s 
translation of the New Testament from spreading more widely 
among the masses, is said to have once purchased and burned 
all the copies which remained unsold. But the bishop’s 
money enabled Tyndale, the following year, to bring outa 
second and more correct edition! 
A quarter of a century after the first appearance of Ton- 
stall’s arithmetic, were issued the writings of Robert Recorde 
(1510-1558). Educated at Oxford and Cambridge, he ex- 
celled in mathematics and medicine. He taught arithmetic 
at Oxford, but found little encouragement, notwithstanding 
the fact that he was an exceptional teacher of this subject. 
Migrating to London, he became physician to Edward VI, 
 
-P-A-G-E-192
  184 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
and later to Queen Mary. It does not seem that he met with 
recompense at all adequate to his merits, for afterwards he was 
confined in prison for debt, and there died. He wrote several 
works, of which we shall notice his arithmetic and (elsewhere) 
his algebra. It is stated that Recorde was the earliest Eng- 
lishman who accepted and advocated the Copernican theory. 
His arithmetic, The Grounde of Artes, was published in 
1540. Unlike Tonstall’s, it is written in English and contains 
the symbols +, —, Z. The last symbol he uses to denote 
equality. In his algebra it is modified into our familiar 
sign =. These three symbols are not used except toward the 
last, under “the rule of Falsehode.” He says? “+ whyche 
betokeneth too muche, as this line, —, plaine without a crosse 
line, betokeneth too little.’ The work is written in the form 
of a dialogue between master and pupil. Once the pupil says, 
“And I to youre authoritie my witte doe subdue, whatsoever 
you say, I take it for true,” whereupon the master replies 
that this is too much, “thoughe I mighte of my Scholler some 
credence require, yet except I shew reason, I do it not desire.” 
. Notice here the rhyme, which sometimes occurs in the book, 
though the verse is not set off into lines by the printer. In 
all operations, even those with denominate numbers, he tests 
the results by “casting out the 9’s.”° The scholar complains 
that he cannot see the reason for the process. “No more 
doe you of manye things else,” replies the master, arguing 
that one must first learn the art by concisely worded rules, 
before the reason can be grasped. This is certainly sound

8 The insufficiency of this test is emphasized by Cocker as follows: 
“But there may be given a thousand (nay infinite) false products in 
multiplication, which after this manner may be proved to be true, and 
therefore this way of proving doth not deserve any example,’’ Arithme- 
tick, 28th Ed., 1714, p, 50.

advice. The method of “casting out the 9’s” is easily learned, 
but the reason for it is beyond the power of the young student. 
It is not contrary to sound pedagogy sometimes to teach 
merely the facts or rules, and to postpone the reasoning to 
a later period. Whoever teaches the method and the reason- 
ing in square root together is usually less successful than he 
who teaches the two apart, one immediately after the other. 
It is, we believe, the usual experience, both of individuals 
and of nations, that the natural order of things is facts first, 
reasons afterwards. This view is no endorsement of mere 
memory-culture, which became universal in England after 
_ the time of Tonstall and Recorde. 
Recorde gives the Rule of Three (or “the golden rule”), 
progressions, alligation, fellowship, and false position. He 
thinks it necessary to repeat all the rules (like the rule of 
three, fellowship, ete.) for fractions, This practice was preva- 
lent then, and for the succeeding 250 years. He was particu- 
larly partial to the rule of false position (“rule of Falsehode”) 
and remark’ that he was in the habit of astonishing his friends 
by proposing hard questions and deducing the correct answer 
by taking the chance replies of “suche children or ydeotes 
as happened to be in the place.” 
It is curious to find in Recorde a treatise on reckoning by 
counters, “whiche doth not onely serve for them that cannot 
write and reade, but also for them that can doe both, but have 
not at some times their pen or tables readie with them.” He 
mentions two ways of representing sums by counters, the Mer- 
chant’s and the Auditor’s account. In the first, 1981. 19 s., 
11 d., is expressed by counters (our dots) thus :— 
a pocket ati ae = 100 + 80 pounds. 
. ens =10+5 +3 pounds. 
2 oe =10+5+4 shillings. 
=6-+5 pence. 
 
-P-A-G-E-194
186 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
Observe that the four horizontal lines stand respectively for 
pence, shillings, pounds, and scores of pounds, that counters in 
the intervening spaces denote half the units in the next line 
above, and that the detached counters to the left are equivalent 
to five counters to the right. 
The abacus with its counters had ceased to be used in Spain 
and Italy in the fifteenth century. In France it was used at 
the time of Recorde, and it did not disappear in England and 
Germany before the middle of the seventeenth century. The 
method of abacal computation is found in the English ex- 
chequer for the last time in 1676. In the reign of Henry I. 
the exchequer was distinctly organized as a court of law, but 
the financial business of the crown was also carried on there. 
The term “exchequer” is derived from the chequered cloth 
which covered the table at which the accounts were made up. 
Suppose the sheriff was summoned to answer for the full annual 
dues “in money or in tallies.” “The liabilities and the actual 
payments of the sheriff were balanced by means of counters 
placed upon the squares of the chequered table, those on the 
one side of the table representing the value of the tallies, 
warrants, and specie presented by the sheriff, and those on the 
other the amount for which he was liable,” so that it was easy 
to see whether the sheriff had met his obligations or not. In 
Tudor times “pen and ink dots” took the place of counters. 
These dots were used as late as 1676.2 The “tally” upon 
which accounts were kept was a peeled wooden rod split in 
such a way as to divide certain notches previously cut in it. 
One piece of the'tally was given to the payer; the other piece 
was kept by the exchequer. The transaction could be verified 
easily by fitting the two halves together and noticing whether

the notches “tallied” or not. Such tallies remained in use as 
late as 1783. : 
In the Winter's Tale (IV., 3), Shakespeare lets the clown be 
embarrassed by a problem which he could not do without 
counters. Iago (in Othello, I.) expresses his contempt for 
Michael Cassio, “forsooth a great mathematician,” by calling 
him a “counter-caster.” ? It thus appears that the old methods 
of computation were used long after the Hindu numerals were 
in common and general use. With such dogged persistency 
does man cling to the old! 
While England, during the sixteenth century, produced no 
mathematicians comparable with Vieta in France, Rheticus 
in Germany, or Cataldi in Italy, it is nevertheless true that 
Tonstall and Recorde, through their mathematical works, re- 
flect credit upon England. Their arithmetics are above the 
average of European works. With the time of Recorde the 
English began to excel in numerical skill as applied to money. 
“The questions of the English books,” says De Morgan, “are 
harder, involve more figures in data, and are more skilfully 
solved.” To this fact, no doubt, we must attribute the ready 
appreciation of decimal fractions, and the instantaneous popu- 
larity of logarithms. The number of arithmetical writers in 
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries is very large. Among 
_the more prominent of the early writers after Tonstall and 
Recorde are:* William Buckley, mathematical tutor of 
Edward VI. and author of Arithmetica Memorativa (1550) ; 
Humfrey Baker, author of The Well-Spring of the Sciences 
(1562); Edmund Wingate, whose Arithmetick appeared about 
1629; William Oughtred, who in 1631 published his Clavis

Mathematice, a systematic text-book on arithmetic and algebra; 
Noah Bridges, author of Vulgar Arithmeticke (1653); Andrew 
Tacquet, a Jesuit mathematician of Antwerp, author of several 
books, in particular of Arithmetice Theoria et Praxis (Antwerp, 
1656, later reprinted in London). Mention should be made 
also of The Pathway of Knowledge, an anonymous work, written 
in Dutch and translated into English in 1596. John Mellis, 
in 1588, issued the first English work on book-keeping by 
double entry.? : 
We have seen that the invention of printing revealed in 
Europe the existence of two schools of arithmeticians, the 
algoristic school, teaching rules of computation and commercial 
arithmetic, and the abacistic school, which gave no rules of 
calculation, but studied the properties of numbers and ratios. 
Boethius was their great master, while the former school 
followed in the footsteps of the Arabs. The algoristic school 
flourished in Italy (Pacioli, Tartaglia, etc.) and found adher- 
ents throughout England and the continent. But it is a 
remarkable fact that the abacistie school, with its pedantry, 
though still existing on the continent, received hardly any 
attention in England. The laborious treatment of arithmetical 
ratios with its burdensome phraseology was of no practical 
use to the English merchant. The English mind instinctively 
rebelled against calling the ratio 3:2=1} by the name of 
proportio superparticularis sesquialtera. 
On the other hand it is a source of regret that the successors 
of Tonstall and Recorde did not observe the high standard of 
authorship set by these two pioneers. A decided decline is 
marked by Buckley’s Arithmetica Memorativa, a Latin treatise 
expressing the rules of arithmetic in verse, which, we take it, 
was intended to be committed to memory. We are glad to be 
1 De Morgan, Arith. Books, p. 27. 
 
-P-A-G-E-197
MODERN TIMES 189 
able to say that this work never became widely popular. The 
practice of expressing rules in verse was common, before the 
invention of printing, but the practice of using them was not 
common, else the number of printed arithmetics on this plan 
would have been much larger than it actually was. Many 
old arithmetics give occasionally a rhyming rule, but few con- 
fine themselves to verse. Few authors are guilty of the folly 
displayed by Buckley or by Solomon Lowe, who set forth 
the rules of arithmetic in English hexameter, and in alpha- 
betical order. 
In this connection it may be stated that an early specimen 
of the muse of arithmetic, first found in the Pathway of Know- 
ledge, 1596, has come down to the present generation as the 
most classical verse of its kind: 
‘“‘Thirtie daies hath September, Aprill, June, and November, 
Februarie eight and twentie alone, all the rest thirtie and one,” 
As a close competitor for popularity is the following stanza? 
quoted by Mr. Davies (Key to Hutton’s “Course”) from a 
manuscript of the date 1570 or near it: 
‘* Multiplication is mie vexation 
And Division is quite as bad, 
The Golden Rule is mie stumbling stule 
And Practice drives me mad.’’ 
In the sixteenth century instances occur of arithmetics writ- 
ten in the form of questions and answers. During the seven- 
teenth century this practice became quite prevalent both in 
England and Germany. We are inclined to agree with 
Wildermuth that it is, on the whole, an improvement on the 
older practice of simply directing the student to do so and so.

  190 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS. 
A question draws the pupil’s attention and prepares his mind 
for the reception of the new information. Unfortunately, the 
question always relates to how a thing is done, never why it is 
done as indicated. It is deplorable to see in the seventeenth 
century, both in England and Germany, that arithmetic is 
reduced more and more to a barren collection of rules. The 
sixteenth century brought forth some arithmetics, by promi- 
nent mathematicians, in which attempts were made at demon- 
stration. Then follows a period in which arithmetic was 
studied solely for commercial purposes, and to this commercial 
school of arithmeticians (about the middle of the seventeenth 
century), says De Morgan,! “we owe the destruction of demon- 
strative arithmetic in this country, or rather the prevention 
of its growth. It never was much the habit of arithmeticians 
to prove their rules; and the very word proof, in that science, 
never came to mean more than a test of the correctness of a 
particular operation, by reversing the process, casting out the 
nines, or the like. As soon as attention was fairly averted to 
arithmetic for commercial purposes alone, such rational appli- 
cation as had been handed down from the writers of the six- 
teenth century began to disappear, and was finally extinct in 
the work of Cocker or Hawkins, as I think I have shown rea- 
son for supposing it should be called.? From this time began 
the finished school of teachers, whose pupils ask, when a ques- 
tion is given, what rule it is in, and run away, when they grow 
up, from any numerical statement, with the declaration that

death by John Hawkins. De Morgan claims that the work was not writ- 
ten by Cocker at all, but by John Hawkins, and that Hawkins attached 
to it Cocker’s name to make it sell. After reading the article ‘‘ Cocker”? 
in the Dictionary of National Biography, we are confident in believing 
Hawkins innocent. Cocker’s sudden death at an early age is sufficient 
to account for most of his works being left for posthumous publication.

anything may be proved by figures—as it may, to them! 
Anything may be unanswerably propounded, by means of 
figures, to those who cannot think upon numbers. Towards 
the end of the last century we see a succession of works, 
arising one after the other, all complaining of the state into 
which arithmetic had fallen, all professing to give rational 
explanation, and hardly one making a single step in advance 
of its predecessors. 
“Tt may very well be doubted whether the earlier arithme- 
ticians could have given general demonstrations of their pro- 
cesses. It is an unquestionable fact of observation that the 
application of elementary principles to their apparently most 
natural deduction, without drawing upon subsequent, or what 
ought to be subsequent, combinations, seldom takes place at 
the commencement of any branch of science. It is the work 
of advanced thought. But the earlier arithmeticians and alge- 
braists had another difficulty to contend with: their fear of 
their own half-understood conclusions, and the caution with 
which it obliged them to proceed in extending their half- 
formed language.” 
Of arithmetical authors belonging to the commercial school 
we mention (besides Cocker) James Hodder, Thomas Dilworth, 
and Daniel Fenning, because we shall find later that their 
books were used in the American colonies. 
James Hodder* was in 1661 writing-master in Lothbury, 
London. He was first known as the author of Hodder’s 
Arithmetick, a popular manual upon which Cocker based his 
better known work. Cocker’s chief improvement is the use 
1 The period of teaching arithmetic wholly by rules began in Germany 
about the middle of the sixteenth century —nearly one hundred years 
earlier than in England. But the Germans returned to demonstrative 
arithmetic in the. eighteenth century, at an earlier period than did the 
British. See Uncer, pp. iv, 117, 137.

  192 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
of the new mode of division, “by giving” (as the Italians 
ealled it), in place of the “scratch” or “galley” method 
taught by Hodder. The first edition of Hodder’s appeared 
in 1661, the twentieth edition in 1739. He wrote also The 
Penman’s Recreation (the specimens of which are engraved 
by Cocker, with whom, it appears, Hodder was friendly), 
and Decimal Arithmetick, 1668. 
Cocker’s Arithmetick went through at least 112 editions,! 
including Scotch and Irish editions.’ Like Francois Barréme 
in France and Adam Riese in Germany, Cocker in England 
enjoyed for nearly a century a proverbial celebrity, these names 
being synonymous with the science of numbers. A man who 
influenced mathematical teaching to such an extent deserves 
at least a brief notice, Edward Cocker (1631-1675) was a prac- 
titioner in the arts of writing, arithmetic, and engraving. In 
1657 he lived “on the south side of St. Paul’s Churchyard” 
where he taught writing and arithmetic “in an extraordinary 
manner.” In 1664 he advertised that he would open a public 
school for writing and arithmetic and take in boarders near 
St. Paul’s. Later he settled at Northampton.’ Aside from

2 «Corrected? editions of Cocker’s Arithmetic were brought out in 
1725, 1781, 1736, 1738, 1745, 1758, 1767 by ‘‘ George Fisher,’ a pseudonym 
for Mrs. Stack. Under the same pseudonym she published in London, 
1763, The Instructor : or Young Man’s best Companion, containing spell- 
ing, reading, writing, and arithmetic, etc., the fourteenth edition of which 
appeared in 1785 at Worcester, Mass., (the twenty-eighth in 1798) under 
the title, The American Instructor: etc., as above. In Philadelphia the 
book was printed in 1748 and 1801. Mrs. Slack is the first woman whom 
we have found engaged in arithmetical authorship. See Bibliotheca 
Mathematica, 1895, p. 75; Teach. and Hist. of Mathematics in the U. 8., 
1890, p. 12.

with silver plates, it being so small that Browne who made it cannot get 
one to do it. So I got Cocker, the famous writing master, to do it, and

the absence of all demonstration, Cocker’s Arithmetic was well 
written, and it evidently suited the demands of the times. He 
was a voluminous writer, being the author of 33 works, 23 
calligraphic, 6 arithmetical, and 4 miscellaneous. The arith- 
metical books are: Tutor to Arithmetick (1664); Compleat 
Arithmetician (1669) ; Arithmetick (1678 ; Peacock on page 454 
gives the date 1677); Decimal Arithmetick, Artificial Arith- 
metick (being of logarithms), Algebraical Arithmetick (treating 
of equations) in three parts, 1684, 1685, “perused and pub- 
lished” by John Hawkins. 
In the English, as well as the French and German arith- 
metics, which appeared during the sixteenth, seventeenth, and 
eighteenth centuries, the “rule of three” occupies a central 
position. Baker says! in his Well-Spring of the Sciences, 1562, 
“The rule of three is the chiefest, and the most profitable, 
and most excellent rule of all arithmeticke. For all other 
rules have neede of it, and it passeth all other; for the which 
cause, it is sayde the philosophers did name it the Golden 
Rule, but now, in these later days, it is called by us the Rule 
of Three, because it requireth three numbers in the operation.” 
There has been among writers considerable diversity in the 
notation for this rule. Peacock (p. 452) states the question 
“Tf 2 apples cost 3 soldi, what will 13 cost?” and with refer- 
ence to it, represents Tartaglia’s notation thus, 
Se pomi 2 || val soldi 3 || che valera pomi 13. 
I set an hour by him to see him design it all; and strange it is to see 
him with his natural eyes to cut so small at his first designing it, and read 
it all over, without any missing, when for my life I could not, with my 
best skill, read one word, or letter of it.... I find the fellow by his dis- 
course very ingenious ; and among other things, a great admirer and well 
read in the English poets, and undertakes to judge of them all, and that 
not impertinently.’’? Cocker wrote quaint poems and distichs which show 
some poetical ability.

The notation of this subject received the special attention of 
Oughtred, who introduced the sign : : and wrote 
2-3::138. 
M. Cantor’ says that the dot, used here to express the ratio, 
later yielded to two dots, for in the eighteenth century the 
German writer, Christian Wolf, secured the adoption of the dot 
as the usual symbol of multiplication. In England the reason 
for the change from dot to colon was a different one. It will 
be remembered that Oughtred did not use the decimal point. 
Its general introduction in England took place in the first 
quarter of the eighteenth century, and we are quite sure that 
it was the decimal point and not Wolf’s multiplication sign 
which displaced Oughtred’s symbol for ratio. As the Ger- 
mans use a decimal comma? instead of our point, the reason 
1 Canror, II., p. 721. 
2The Germans attribute the introduction of the decimal comma to 
Kepler (see Unerr, p. 104; Germann, pp. 78, 109; Ginrner, Vermischte 
Untersuchungen, p. 133). He uses it in a publication of 1616. Napier, 
in his Rabdologia (1617) speaks of ‘‘adding a period or comma,’’ and 
writes 1993,273 (see Construction, Macponatp’s Ed., p. 89). English 
writers did not confine themselves to the decimal point ; the comma is 
often used. Thus, Martin’s Decimal Arithmetick (1763) and Wilder’s 
edition of Newton’s Universal Arithmetick, London, 1769, use the 
comma exclusively. In Kersey’s Wingate (1735) and in Dilworth (1784),

for the change could not have been the same in Germany as 
in England. Dilworth’ does not use the dot in multiplication, 
but he employs the decimal point and writes? proportion 
once 2--4::8--16, and on another page 3:17::48. Before 
the present century, the dot was seldom used by English 
writers to denote multiplication. If Oughtred had been in 
the habit of regarding a proportion as the equality of two 
ratios, then he would probably have chosen the symbol = 
instead of ::. The former sign was actually used for this 
purpose by Leibniz.? The notation 2:4=1:2 was brought 
into use in the United States and England during the first 
quarter of the nineteenth century, when Euler’s Algebra and 
French text-books began to be studied by the English-speaking 
nations. 
The rule of three reigned supreme in commercial arith- 
metics in Germany until the close of the eighteenth century, 
and in England and America until the close of the first quarter 
of the present century. It has been much used since. An 
we read of the ‘point or comma,’’ but the point is the sign actually 
used, In Dodson’s Wingate (1760) both the comma and point are used, 
the latter, perhaps, more frequently. Cocker (1714) and Hatton (1721) 
do not even mention the comma, i

monials are dated 1743. 
2 In his time old and new notations were in simultaneous use, for he 
says, ‘‘Some masters, instead of points, use long strokes to keep the 
terms separate, but it is wrong to do so; for the two points between the 
first and second terms, and also between the third and fourth terms, 
shew that the two first and the two last terms are in the same proportion. 
And whereas four points are put between the second and third terms, 
they serve to disjoint them, and shew that the second and third, and 
first and fourth terms are not in the same direct proportion to each 
other as are these before mentioned.” 8 WILDERMUTH.

as the universal rule for problem-working, during the sixteenth century;

important role was played in commercial circles by an allied 
tule called in English chain-rule or conjoined proportion, in 
French régle conjointe, and in German Kettensatz or Reesischer 
Satz... It received its most perfect formal development and 
most extended application in Germany and the Netherlands. 
Kelly? attributes the superiority of foreign merchants in the 
science of exchange to a more intimate knowledge of this rule. 
The chain-rule was known in its essential feature to the Hindu 
Brahmagupta; also to the Italians, Leonardo of Pisa, Pacioli, 
Tartaglia; to the early Germans, Johann Widmann and Adam 
Riese. In England the rule was elaborated by John Kersey 
in his edition of 1668 of Wingate’s arithmetic. But the one 
who contributed most toward its diffusion was Kaspar Franz 
von Rees (born 1690) of Roermonde in Limburg, who migrated 
to Holland. There he published in Dutch an arithmetic which 
appeared in French translation in 1737, and in German transla- 
tion in 1739. In Germany the Reesischer Satz became famous. 
Cocker (28th Ed., Dublin, 1714, p. 232) illustrates the rule by 
the example: “If 40 1. Auverdupois weight at London is equal 
to 36 1. weight at Amsterdam, and 90 1. at Amsterdam makes 
116 1. at Dantzick, then how many Pounds at Dantzick are equal 
to 112 1. Auwverdupois weight at London?” 
the method, called Practice, being preferred during the seventeenth cen- 
tury, the Chain-Rule during the eighteenth, and Analysis (Bruchsatz, or 
Schlussrechnung) during the nineteenth. We fail to observe similar 
changes in England. There the rule of three occupied a commanding 
position until the present century ; the rules of single and double position 
were used in the time of Recorde more than afterwards; the Chain-Rule 
never became widely popular ; while some attention was always paid to 
Practice. 
1 The writer remembers being taught the ‘‘ Kettensatz’’ in 1878 at the 
Kantonsschule in Chur, Switzerland, along with three other methods, 
the ‘‘ Hinheitsmethode’’ (Schlussrechnung), the ‘ Zerlegungsmethode ” 
(a form of Italian practice) and ‘+ Proportion.”

90 produce 3600 for a Divisor, and Division being finished, the 
Quotient giveth 1293312 Pounds at Dantzick for the Answer.” 
The chain-rule owes its celebrity to the fact that the correct 
answer could be obtained without any exercise of the mind. 
Rees reduced the statement to a mere mechanism. While 
useful to the merchant, the rule was worthless for mind-culture 
in the school-room. Attempts were made by some arithmetical 
writers to prove it with aid of proportions or by ordinary 
analysis. But for pedagogical purposes those attempts proved 
unsatisfactory. A rule, more apt to lead to errors, but requir- 
ing some thought, became known in Germany as “ Basedowsche 
Regel,” being recommended by the educational reformer Base- 
dow, though not first given by him. Early in the present 
century, arithmetical teaching was revolutionized in Germany. 
The chain-rule and rule of three were gradually driven into the 
background, and the “Schlussrechnung” attained more and 
more prominence, even though Pestalozzi was partial to the 
use of proportion. The “Schlussrechnung” is sometimes 
designated in English by the word Analysis. If 3 yards cost 
$7, what will 19 yards cost? One yard will cost $ 4, and 19 
$7 x19 
3 yards = $44.33; or bya modification of the above, by 
“aliquot parts”: 18 yards will cost $42; one yard $ 2.33, 
and 19 yards, $44.33. This “Schlussrechnung” was known

to Tartaglia, but is, without doubt, very much older ; for it is 
a thoroughly natural method which would suggest itself to any 
sound and vigorous mind. Its pedagogical value lies in the 
fact that there is no mechanism about it, that it requires no 
memorizing of formule, but makes arithmetic an exercise in 
thinking. It is strange indeed that in modern times such a 
method should have been disregarded by arithmeticians dur- 
ing three long centuries. 
English arithmetics embraced all the commercial subjects 
previously used by the Italians, such as simple and compound 
interest, the direct rule of three, the inverse rule of three 
(called by Recorde “backer rule of three”), loss and. gain, 
barter, equation of payments, bills of exchange, alligation, 
annuities, the rules for single and double position, and the 
subject of tare, trett, cloff. We let Dilworth (p. 37, 1784) 
explain the last three terms: 
‘© @. Which are the Allowances usually made in Averdupois great 
Weight to the Buyer? 
A, They are Tare, Trett, and Cloff. 
Q. What is Tare ? 
A. Tare is an Allowance made to the Buyer, for the Weight of the 
Box, Bag, Vessel, or whatever else contains the Goods bought. . . . 
Q. What is Trett ? 
A. Trett is an Allowance by the Merchant to the Buyer of 4 Ib. in 
104 lb., that is, the six-and-twentieth Part, for Waste or Dust, in some 
Sorts of Goods. .. . 
Q. What is Cloff ? 
A. Cloff is an Allowance of 2 lb. Weight to the Citizens of London, 
on every Draught above 3 C. Weight, on some Sorts of Goods, as Galls, 
Madder, Sumac, Argol, etc.! 
Q. What are these Allowances called beyond the Seas ? 
A. They are called the Courtesies of London; because they are not 
practiced in any other Place.” 
1 The term ‘‘cloff’’ had also a more general meaning, denoting a small 
allowance made on goods sold in gross, to make up for deficiences in 
weight when sold in retail. Pracock, p. 455.

MODERN TIMES aoe) 
To the above subjects, which were borrowed from the 
Italians, English writers added their own weights and meas- 
ures, and those of the countries with which England traded. 
In the seventeenth century were added decimal fractions, which 
were taught in books more assiduously then than a century 
later. It is surprising to find that some arithmetics devoted 
considerable attention to logarithms. Cocker wrote a book on 
“ Artificial Arithmetick.” We have seen the rules for the 
use of logarithms, together with logarithmic tables of num- 
bers, in the arithmetics of John Hill (10th Ed. by E. Hatton, 
London, 1761), Benjamin Martin (Decimal Arithmetick, London, 
1763; said to have been first published in 1735), Edward 
Hatton (Intire System of Arithmetic, London, 1721) and in 
editions of Edmund Wingate. Wingate was a London lawyer 
who pursued mathematics for pastime. Spending a few years 
in Paris, he published there in 1625! his Arithmétique loga- 
rithmique, which appeared in London in English translation 
in 1635.2. Wingate was the first to carry Briggian logarithms 
(taken from Gunter’s tables) into France. About the year 
1629 he published his Arithmetick “in which his principal 
design was to obviate the difficulties which ordinarily occur 
in the using of logarithms: To perform this he divided his 
work into two books; the first he called Natural, and the 
second Artificial Arithmetic.” ® Subsequent editions of Wingate 
rested on the first of those two books, and were brought out 
by John Kersey, later by George Shelley, and finally by James 
Dodson. The work was modified so largely, that Wingate 
would not have known it.

200 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
It is interesting to observe how writers sometimes intro- 
duced subjects of purely theoretical value into practical arith- 
metics. Perhaps authors thought that theoretical points 
which they themselves had mastered and found of interest, 
ought to excite the curiosity of their readers. Among these 
subjects are square-, cube-, and higher roots, continued frac- 
tions, circulating decimals, and tables of the powers of 2 up to 
the 144th. The last were “very useful for laying up grains of 
corn on the squares of a chess-board, ruining people by horse- 
shoe bargains, and other approved problems” (De Morgan). 
The subject of circulating decimals was first elaborated by 
John Wallis (Algebra, Ch. 89), Leonhard Euler (Algebra, Book 
L, Ch. 12), and John Bernoulli. Circulating decimals were at 
one time “suffered to embarrass books on practical arithmetic, 
which need have no more to do with them than books on 
mensuration with the complete quadrature of the circle.” 
The Decimal Arithmetic of 1742 by John Marsh is almost 
entirely on this subject. As his predecessors he mentions 
Wallis, Jones (1706), Ward, Brown, Malcolm, Cunn, Wright. 
After the great fire of London, in 1666, the business of fire 
insurance began to take practical shape, and in 1681 the first 
regular fire insurance office was opened in London. The first 
office in Scotland was established in 1720, the first in Ger- 
many in 1750, the first in the United States at Philadelphia 
in 1752, with Benjamin Franklin as one of the directors.’ 
In course of time, fire insurance received some attention in 
English arithmetics. In 1734 the first approach to modern 
life insurance was made, but all members were rated alike, 
irrespective of age. In 1807 we have the first instance of 
rating “according to age and other circumstances.” 
It is interesting to observe that before the middle of the

MODERN TIMES’ 201 
eighteenth century it was the custom in England to begin 
the legal year with the 25th of March. Not until 1752 
did the counting of the new year begin with the first of 
January and according to the Gregorian calendar! In 1752, 
eleven days were dropped between the 2d and 14th of 
September, thereby changing from “old style” to “new 
style.” 
The order in which the various subjects were treated in old 
arithmetics was anything but logical. The definitions are 
frequently given in a collection at the beginning. Dilworth 
develops the rules for “whole numbers,” then develops the 
same rules for “vulgar fractions,” and again for “decimal 
fractions.” Thus he gives the “rule of three,” later the “rule 
of three in fractions,” and, again, the “rule of three direct in 
decimals.” John Hill, in his arithmetic (edition of 1761), adds 
to this “the golden rule in logarithms.” Fractions are taken 
up late. Evidently many students had no expectation of ever 
reaching fractions, and, for their benefit, the first part of the 
arithmetics embraced all the commercial rules. In the eigh- 
teenth century the practice of postponing fractions to the 
last became more prevalent.? Moreover, the treatment of 
this subject was usually very meagre. While the better types 
1. Srove in his New Mathematical Dictionary, London, 1748, speaks 
of the various early changes of the calendar and then says, ‘‘ Pope 
Gregory XIII. pretended to reform it again, and ordered his account 
to be current, as it still is in all the Roman Catholick countries.’ Much 
prejudice, no doubt, lay beneath the word ‘‘ pretended,’’ and the word 
‘still,’ in this connection, now causes a smile. 
2Joun Kersey, in the 16th Ed. of Wineatn’s Arithmetick, London, 
1735, says in his preface, ‘‘ For the Ease and Benefit of those Learners 
that desire only so much Skill in Arithmetick as is useful in Accompts, 
Trade, and such like ordinary Employments; the Doctrine of Numbers 
(which, in the First Edition, was intermingled with Definitions and 
Rules concerning Broken Numbers, commonly called Fractions) is now 
entirely handled a-part. . . . So that now Arithmetick in Whole Numbers

of arithmetics, Wingate for instance, show how to find the 
L.C.D. in the addition of fractions, the majority of books 
take for the C.D. the product of the denominators. Thus, 
Cocker gives 8000 as the C.D. of 3, 4, 3, 42; Dilworth gives 
4+4=1,5;; Hatton gives 5 + 3= 32 = }#. 
It was the universal custom to treat the rule of three 
under two distinct heads, “Rule of Three Direct” and “ Rule 
of Three Inverse.” The former embraces problems like this, 
“Tf 4 Students spend 19 Pounds, how many Pounds will 8. 
students spend at the same Rate of Expence?” ( Wingate.) 
The inverse rule treats questions of this sort, “If 8 horses 
will be maintained 12 Days with a certain Quantity of Prov- 
ender, How many Days will the same Quantity maintain 
16 Horses?” (Wingate.) In problems like the former the 
correct answer could be gotten by taking the three numbers in 
order as the first three terms of a proportion. In Wingate’s 
Students Pounds Students 
notation, we would have, If 4 19 8. Butin 
the second example “you cannot say here in a direct propor- 
tion (as before in the Rule of Three Direct) as 8 to 16, so is 
12 to another Number which ought to be in that Case as great 
again as 12; but contrariwise by an inverted Proportion, begin- 
ning with the last Term first; as 16 is to 8, so is 12 to another 
Number.” (Wingate, 1735, p. 57.) This brings out very 
clearly the appropriateness of the term “Rule of Three 
inverse.” As all problems were classified by authors under 
two distinct heads, the direct rule and the inverse rule, the 
pupil could get correct answers by a purely mechanical pro- 
cess, without being worried by the question, under-which rule 
is plainly and fully handled before any Ent’rance be made into the 
craggy Paths of Fractions, at the Sight of which some Learners are so 
discouraged, that they make a stand, and cry out, non plus ultra, There’s 
no Progress farther.”
-P-A-G-E-211
  MODERN TIMES 203 
does the problem come? Thus that part of the subject which 
taxes to the utmost the skill of the modern teacher of propor- 
tion, was formerly disposed of in an easy manner. No heed 
was paid to mental discipline. Nor did authors care what the 
pupil would do with a problem, when he was not told before- 
hand to what rule it belonged. 
Beginning with the time of Cocker, all demonstrations are 
carefully omitted. The only proofs known to Dilworth are of 
this kind, “Multiplication and division prove each other.” 
The only evidence we could find that John Hill was aware 
of the existence of such things as mathematical demonstrations 
lies in the following passage, “So } multiplied by + becomes 4. 
See this demonstrated in Mr. Leyburn’s Cursus Mathematicus, 
page 38.” What a contrast between this and our quotation on 
fractions from Tonstall! The practice of referring to other 
works was more common in arithmetics then than now. 
Cocker refers to Kersey’s Appendia, to Wingate’s Arithmetic, 
to Pitiscus’s Trigonometria, and to Oughtred’s Clavis for the 
proof of the rule of Double Position. Cocker repeatedly gives 
on the margin Latin quotations from the Clavis, from Alsted’s 
Mathematics, or Gemma-Frisius’s Methodus Facilis (Witten- 
berg, 1548). 
Toward the end of the eighteenth century demonstrations 
begin to appear, in the better books, but they are often placed 
at the foot of the page, beneath a horizontal line, the rules and 
examples being above the line. By this arrangement the 
author’s conscience was appeased, while the teacher and pupil 
who did not care for proofs were least annoyed by their 
presence and could easily skip them. Moreover, the proofs 
and explanations were not adapted to the young mind; there 
was no trace of object-teaching; the presentation was too 
abstract. True reform, both in England and America, began 
only with the introduction of Pestalozzian ideas.

  204 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
Mental arithmetic received no attention in England before 
the present century, but in Germany it was introduced during 
the second half of the eighteenth century.! 
Causes which Checked the Growth of Demonstrative Arithmetic 
in England 
Before the Reformation there was little or nothing accom- 
plished in the way of public education in England. In the 
monasteries some instruction was given by monks, but we 
have no evidence that any branch of mathematics was taught 
to the youth.’ In 1393 was established the celebrated “ public 
school,” named Winchester, and in 1440, Eton. In the six- 
teenth century, on the suppression of the monasteries, 
schools were founded in considerable numbers — The Mer- 
chant Taylors’ School, Christ Hospital, Rugby, Harrow, and 
others—which in England monopolize the title “public 
schools” and for centuries have served for the education 
of the sons mainly of the nobility and gentry.? In these 
schools the ancient classics were the almost exclusive subjects 
of study ; mathematical teaching was-unknown there. Per- 
haps the demands of every-day life forced upon the boys a 
knowledge of counting and of the very simplest computations, 
but we are safe in saying that, before the close of the last 
century, the ordinary boy of England’s famous public schools

could not divide 2021 by 43, though such problems had been 
performed centuries before according to the teaching of 
Brahmagupta and Bhaskara by boys brought up on the far-off 
banks of the Ganges. It has been reported that Charles XII. 
of Sweden considered a man ignorant of arithmetic but half 
aman. Such was not the sentiment among English gentle- 
men. Not only was arithmetic unstudied by them, but con- 
sidered beneath their notice. If we are safe in following 
Timbs’s account of a book of 1622, entitled Peacham’s Compleat 
Gentleman, which enumerates subjects at that time among 
the becoming accomplishments of an English man of rank, 
then it appears that the elements of astronomy, geometry, and 
mechanics were studies beginning to demand a gentleman’s 
attention, while arithmetic still remained untouched.’ Listen 
to another writer, Edmund Wells. In his Young Gentleman’s 
Course in Mathematicks, London, 1714, this able author aims 
to provide for gentlemanly education as opposed to that of 
“the meaner part of mankind.” He expects those whom God 
has relieved from the necessity of working, to exercise their 
faculties to his greater glory. But they must not “be so Brisk 
and Airy, as to think, that the knowing how to cast Accompt 
is requisite only for such Underlings as Shop-keepers or Trades- 
men,” and if only for the sake of taking care of themselves, “no 
gentleman ought to think Arithmetick below Him that do’s 
not think an Estate below Him.” All the information we 
could find respecting the education of the upper classes points 
to the conclusion that arithmetic was neglected, and that De 
Morgan * was right in his statement that as late as the eigh- 
teenth century there could have been no such thing as a teacher 
of arithmetic in schools like Eton. In 1750, Warren Hastings,

who had been attending Westminster, was put into a commer- 
cial school, that he might study arithmetic and book-keeping 
before sailing for Bengal. 
At the universities little was done in mathematics before 
the middle of the seventeenth century. It would seem that 
Tonstall’s work was used at Cambridge about 1550, but in 
1570, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, fresh statutes were 
given, excluding all mathematics from the course of undergradu- 
ates, presumably because this study pertained to practical life, 
and could, therefore, have no claim to attention in a university.’ 
The commercial element in the arithmetics and algebras of 
early times was certainly very strong. Observe how the Arab 
Muhammed ibn Miis& and the Italian writers discourse on 
questions of money, partnership, and legacies. Significant 
is the fact that the earliest English algebra is dedicated by 
Recorde to the company of merchant adventurers trading to 
Moscow.’ Wright, in his English edition of Napier’s loga- 
rithms, likewise appeals to the commercial classes: “To the 
Right Honourable And Right Worshipfvll Company Of Mer- 
chants of London trading to the East-Indies, Samvel Wright 
wisheth all prosperitie in this life and happinesse in the life to 
come.”* It is also significant that the first headmaster of the 
Merchant Taylors’ School, a reformer with views in advance of 
his age, in a book of 1581 speaks of mathematical instruction, 
thinks that a few of the most earnest and gifted students might 
hope to attain a knowledge of geometry and arithmetic from 
Euclid’s Elements, but fails to notice Recorde’s arithmetic, 
which since 1540 had appeared in edition after edition. Clas-

sical men were evidently not in touch with the new in the 
mathematics of that time. 
This scorn and ignorance of the art of computation by all 
but commercial classes is seen in Germany as well as England. 
Kastner! speaks of it in connection with German Latin 
schools; Unger refers to it repeatedly.” 
It was not before the present century that arithmetic and 
other branches of mathematics found admission into England’s 
public schools. At Harrow “vulgar fractions, Euclid, geog- 
raphy, and modern history were first studied” in 1829.3 At 
the Merchant Taylors’ School “mathematics, writing, and 
arithmetic were added in 1829.”* At Eton “mathematics was 
not compulsory till 1851.”5 The movement against the ex- 
elusive classicism of the schools was led by Dr. Thomas 
Arnold of Rugby, the father of Matthew Arnold. Dr. Arnold 
favoured the introduction of mathematics, science, history, and 
politics. 
Since the art of calculation was no more considered a part of 
a liberal education than was the art of shoe-making, it is 
natural to find the study of arithmetic relegated to the com- 
mercial schools. The poor boy sometimes studied it; the rich 
boy did not need it. In Latin schools it was unknown, but in 
schools for the poor it was sometimes taught; for example, 
in a “free grammar school founded by a grocer of London in 
1553 for thirty ‘of the poorest men’s sons’ of Guilford, to be 
taught to read and write English and cast accounts perfectly, 
so that they should be fitted for apprentices.”® That a 
science, ignored as a mental discipline, and studied merely as 
an aid to material gain, should fail to receive fuller develop- 
ment, is not strange. It was, in fact, very natural that it

208 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
should entirely discard those features belonging more prop- 
erly to a science and assume the form of an art. So arithmetic 
reduced itself to a mere collection of rules. The ancient 
Carthaginians, like the English, studied arithmetic, but did 
not develop it as a science. “It is a beautiful testimony to 
the quality of the Greek mind that Plato and others assign as 
a cause of the low state of arithmetic and mathematics among 
the Pheenicians . . . the want of free and disinterested inves- 
tigation.” ? 
It will be observed that during the period under considera- 
tion, the best English mathematical minds did not make their 
influence felt in arithmetic. The best intellects held aloof 
from the elementary teacher; arithmetical texts were written 
by men of limited education. During the seventeenth and 
eighteenth centuries England had no Tonstall and Recorde, 
no Stifel and Regiomontanus, no Pacioli and Tartaglia, to 
compose her arithmetical books. To be sure, she had her 
Wallis, her Newton, Cotes, Hook, Taylor, Maclaurin, De 
Moivre, but they wrote no books for elementary schools; their 
influence on arithmetical teaching was naught. Contrast this 
period with the present century. Think of the pains taken 
by Augustus De Morgan to reform elementary mathematical 
instruction. The man who could write a brilliant work on 
the Calculus, who could make new discoveries in advanced 
algebra, series} and in logic, was the man who translated 
Bourdon’s arithmetic from the French, composed an arith- 
metic and elementary algebra for younger students, and 
endeavoured to simplify, without loss of rigour, the Euclidean 
geometry. Again, run over the list of members of the “ Asso- 
ciation for the Improvement of Geometrical Teaching,” and 
of the Committee of the British Association on geometrical

teaching, and you will find in it England’s most brilliant 
mathematicians of our time. 
The imperfect interchange of ideas between writers on 
advanced and those on elementary subjects is exhibited in 
the mathematical works of John Ward of Chester. He pub- 
lished in 1695 a Compendium of Algebra, and in 1706 his 
Young Mathematician’s Guide. The latter work appeared in 
the 12th edition in 1771, was widely read in Great Britain, 
and well approved in the universities of England, Scotland, 
and Ireland. It was once a favourite text-book in Ameri- 
can colleges, being used as early as 1737 at Harvard College, 
and as late as 1787 at Yale and Dartmouth. In 475 pages, 
the book covered the subjects of Arithmetic, Algebra, Geom- 
etry, Conic Sections, and Arithmetic of Infinites, giving, of 
course, the mere rudiments of each. 
Ward shows how to raise a binomial to positive integral 
powers “without the trouble of continued involution” and 
remarks that when he published this method in his Compen- 
dium of Algebra he thought that he was the first inventor of 
it, but that since he has found in Wallis’s History of Algebra 
“that the learned Sir Isaac Newton had discovered it long 
before.” It took a quarter of a century for the news of 
Newton’s binomial discovery to reach John Ward. More- 
over, it looks very odd to see in Ward’s Guide of 1771 —over 
a century after Newton’s discovery of fluxions—a sort of 
integral calculus, such as was employed by Wallis, Cavalieri, 
Fermat, and Roberval before the invention of fluxions. 
It is difficult to discover a time when in any civilized country 
advanced and elementary writers on mathematics were more 
thoroughly out of touch with each other than in England dur- 
ing the two centuries and a half preceding 1800. We can 
think of no other instance in science in which the failure of 
the best minds to influence the average has led to such 
P

lamentable results. In recent times we have heard it deplored 
that in some countries practical chemistry does not avail itself 
of the results of theoretical chemistry. Fears have been 
expressed of a coming schism between applied higher mathe- 
matics and theoretical higher mathematics. But thus far 
these evils appear insignificant, as compared with the wide- 
spread repression and destruction of demonstrative arithmetic, 
arising from the failure of higher minds to guide the rank 
and file. Neglected by the great thinkers of the day, scorned 
by the people of rank, urged onward by considerations of 
purely material gain, arithmetical writers in England (as 
also in Germany and France) were led into a course which 
for centuries blotted the pages of educational history. 
In those days English and German boys often prepared 
for a business career by attending schools for writing and 
arithmetic. During the Middle Ages and also long after the 
invention of printing, the art of writing was held in high 
esteem. In writing schools much attention was given to 
fancy writing. The schools embracing both subjects are 
always named schools for “writing and arithmetic,” never 
“arithmetic and writing.” The teacher was called “ writing- 
master and arithmetician.” Cocker was skilful with the pen, 
and wrote many more books on calligraphy than on arithmetic. 
As to the quality of the teachers, Peacham in his Compleat 
Gentleman (1622) stigmatizes the schoolmasters in his own 
day as rough and even barbarous to their pupils. Domestic 
tutors he represents as still worse.! The following from 
an arithmetic of William Webster, London, 1740, gives an 
idea of the origin of many commercial schools.2 “When a 
Man has tried all Shifts, and still failed, if he can but scratch 
out anything like a fair Character, tho never so stiff and

unnatural and has got but Arithmetick enough in his Head to 
compute the Minutes in a Year, or the Inches in a Mile, he 
makes his last Recourse to a Garret, and with the Painter’s 
Help, sets up for a Teacher of Writing and Arithmetick ; where, 
by the Bait of low Prices, he perhaps gathers a Number of 
Scholars.” No doubt in previous centuries, as in all times, 
there were some good teachers, but the large mass of school- 
masters in England, Germany, and the American colonies were 
of the type described in the above extract. Some of the more 
ambitious and successful of these teachers wrote the arithmetics 
for the schools. No wonder that arithmetical authorship and 
teaching were at a low ebb. 
To summarize, the causes which checked the growth of 
demonstrative arithmetic are as follows: 
(1) Arithmetic was not studied for its own sake, nor valued 
for the mental discipline which it affords, and was, consequently, 
learned only by the commercial classes, because of the material 
gain derived from a knowledge of arithmetical rules. 
(2) The best minds failed to influence and guide the average 
minds in arithmetical authorship. 
Reforms in Arithmetical Teaching 
A great reform in elementary education was initiated in 
Switzerland and Germany at the beginnning of the nine- 
teenth century. Pestalozzi emphasized in all instruction the 
necessity of object-teaching. “Of the instruction at Yverdun, 
the most successful in the opinion of those who visited the 
school, was the instruction in arithmetic. The children are 
described as performing with great rapidity very difficult tasks 
in head-calculation. Pestalozzi based his method here, as in 
other subjects, on the principle that the individual should be 
brought to the knowledge by the road similar to that which

the whole race had used in founding the science. Actual 
counting of things preceded the first Cocker, as actual meas- 
urement of land preceded the original Euclid. The child 
must be taught to count things and to find out the various 
processes experimentally in the concrete, before he is given 
any abstract rule, or is put to abstract exercises. This plan 
is now adopted in German schools, and many ingenious con- 
trivances have been introduced by which the combinations of 
things can be presented to the children’s sight.”1 Much 
remained to be done by the followers of Pestalozzi in the way 
of practical realization of his ideas. Moreover, a readjust- 
ment of the course of instruction was needed, for Pestalozzi 
quite ignored those parts of arithmetic which are applied in 
every-day life. Until about 1840 Pestalozzi’s notions were 
followed more or less closely. In 1842 appeared A. W. Grube’s 
Leitfaden, which was based on Pestalozzi’s idea of object- 
teaching, but, instead of taking up addition, subtraction, mul- 
tiplication, and division in the order as here given, advocated 
the exclusion of the larger numbers at the start, and the teach- 
ing of all four processes in connection with the first circle 
of numbers (say, the numbers 1 to 10) before proceeding to 
a larger circle. For a time Grube’s method was tried in 
Germany, but it soon met with determined opposition. The 
experience of both teachers and students seems to be that, to 
reach satisfactory results, an extraordinary expenditure of 
energy is demanded. In the language of physics, Grube’s 
method seems to be an engine having a low efficiency.”

mittance. At the time when De Morgan began to write (about 
1830) arithmetical teaching had not risen far above the level 
of the eighteenth century. In more recent time the teach- 
ing of arithmetic has been a subject of discussion by the 
“ Association for the Improvement of Geometrical Teaching.”? 
Among the subjects under consideration have been the mul- 
tiplication and division of concrete quantities, the approxi- 
mate multiplication of decimals (by leaving off the tail of the 
product), and modification in the processes of subtraction, mul- 
tiplication, and division. The new modes of subtraction and 
division are called in Germany the “Austrian methods,” be- 
cause the Austrians were the first to adopt them. In England 
this mode of division goes by the name of “ Italian method.” * 
The “Austrian” method of subtraction is simply this: It 
shall be performed in the same way as “change” is given in 
a store by adding from the lower to the higher instead of 
passing from the higher to the lower by mental subtraction. 
Thus, in 76 — 49, say “nine and seven are sixteen, five and 
two are seven.” The practice of adding 1 to the 4, instead 
of subtracting 1 from 7, was quite common during the Renais- 
sance. It was used, for instance, by Maximus Planudes 
Georg Peuerbach, and Adam Riese. In Adam Riese’s works 
there is also an approach to the determination of the differ- 
ence by figuring from the subtrahend upwards. In the above 
example, he would subtract 9 from 10 and add the remainder 
1 to the minuend 6, thus obtaining the answer 7.3 A recent 
American text-book on algebra explains subtraction on the 
principle of the “ Austrian method.”

English arithmetic of 1730. See General Report of A. I. G. T., 1892, p. 34.

In multiplication, the recommendation is to begin, as in alge- 
bra, with the figure of highest denomination in the multiplier. 
The great advantage of this shows itself in decimal multiplica- 
tion in case we desire only an approximate answer correct to, 
say, three or five decimal places. We have seen that this method 
was much used by the Florentines and was called by Pacioli, 
“by the little castle.” Of the various multiplication processes 
of the Renaissance, the fittest failed to survive! The process 
now advocated was taught by Nicholas Pike? in the following 
example: “It is required to multiply 56.7534916 by 5.376928, 
and to retain only five places of decimals in the product.”

value first ; in the multiplication of large numbers we are often interested 
most in the highest places.” See H. NrzeperMUvver, Lagrange’s Mathe-

algebra, delivered by the great Lagrange at the Normal School in Paris, 
in 1795, is very interesting for several reasons.

not entirely new; in the “galley” or “scratch” method, the 
partial products were not written down, but at once subtracted,

Weights and Measwres.—The weights and measures intro- 
duced into the United States were derived from the English. 
“It was from the standards of the exchequer that all the 
weights and measures of the United States were derived, until 
Congress fixed the standard. Louisiana at first recognized 
standards derived from the French, but in 1814 the United 
States revenue standards were established by law.”? The 
actual standards used in the several states and in the custom- 
houses were, however, found to be very inaccurate. In the 
construction of accurate standards for American use, our Goy- 
ernment engaged the services of Ferdinand Rudolph Hassler, 
a Swiss by birth and training, and a skilful experimental- 
ist. The work of actual construction was begun in 1835.4 
In 1836, carefully constructed standards were distributed to 
the custom-houses and furnished the means of uniformity 
in the collection of the customs. Moreover, accurate stand- 
ards were distributed by the general Government to the

various States, with the view of securing greater uniformity. 
It was recommended that each State prepare for them a 
fire-proof room and place them “under the charge of some 
scientific person who would attend to their use and safe- 
keeping.” 
In 1866 Congress authorized the use of the Metric System 
in the United States, but unfortunately stopped here and 
allowed the nations of Continental Europe to advance far 
beyond us by their adoption of the Metric System to the exclu- 
sion of all older systems. 
In the currency of the American colonies there existed great 
diversity and confusion. “At the time of the adoption of our 
decimal currency by Congress, in 1786, the colonial currency or 
bills of credit, issued by the colonies, had depreciated in value, 
and this depreciation, being unequal in the different colonies, 
gave rise to the different values of the State currencies.” ? 
Inasmuch as all our early arithmetics were “ practical ” arith- 
metics, they, of course, gave rules for the “reduction of coin.” 
Thus Pike’s Arithmetic? devotes twenty-two pages to the 
statement and illustration of rules for reducing “ Newhamp- 
shire, Massachusetts, Rhodeisland, Connecticut, and Virginia 
currency” (1) to “Federal Money,” (2) to “Newyork and 
Northcarolina currency,” (8) to “Pennsylvania, Newjersey, 
Delaware, and Maryland currency, . . .” (6) to “Irish money,” 
(7) to “Canada and Novascotia currency,” (8) to “Livres Tour- 
nois,” (9) to “Spanish milled dollars.” Then follow rules for 
reducing Federal Money to “Newengland and Virginia cur- 
rency,” ete. It is easy to see how a large share of the pupil’s 
time was absorbed in the mastery of these rules. The chap-

give evidence of the homage that Education was forced to 
pay to Practical Life, at the sacrifice of matter better fitted 
to develop the mind of youth. With a view of supplying 
the information needed by merchants in business, arithmetics 
discussed such subjects as the United States Securities, the 
various rules adopted by the United States, and by the 
State governments on partial payments. : 
Authors and Books.—The first arithmetics used in the 
American colonies were» English works: Cocker, Hodder, 
Dilworth, “George Fisher” (Mrs. Slack), Daniel Fenning.! 
The earliest arithmetic written and printed in America ap- 
peared anonymously in Boston in 1729. Though a work of 
considerable merit, it seems to have been used very little; in 
early records we have found no reference to it; fifty years 
later, at the publication of Pike’s Arithmetic, the former work 
was completely forgotten, and Pike’s was declared to be the 
earliest American arithmetic. Of the 1729 publication there 
are two copies in the Harvard Library and one in the Congres- 
sional Library. In Appleton’s Cyclopedia of American Biog- 
raphy its authorship is ascribed without reserve to Isaac Green- 
wood, then professor of mathematics at Harvard College, but 
on the title-page of one of the copies in the Harvard Library, 
is written the following: “Supposed that Sam! Greenwood 
was the author thereof, by others said to be by Isaac Green- 
wood.” In 1788 appeared at Newburyport the New and 
Complete System of Arithmetic by Nicholas Pike (1743-1819), 
a graduate of Harvard College.* It was intended for advanced 
schools, and contained, besides the ordinary subjects of that 
time, logarithms, trigonometry, algebra, and conic sections; 
but these latter subjects were so briefly treated as to possess 
little value. In the “Abridgment for the Use of Schools,”

which was brought out at Worcester in 1793, the larger work 
is spoken of in the preface as “now used as a classical book in 
all the Newengland Universities.” A recent writer’ makes 
Pike responsible for all the abuses in arithmetical teaching 
that prevailed in early American schools. To us this con- 
demnation of Pike seems wholly unjust. It is unmerited, 
even if we admit that Pike was in no sense a reformer among 
arithmetical authors. Most of the evils in question have a far 
remoter origin than the time of Pike. Our author is fully up 
to the standard of English works of that date. He can no 
more be blamed by us for giving the aliquot parts of pounds 
and shillings, for stating rules for “tare and trett,” for dis- 
cussing the “reduction of coins,” than the future historian can 
blame works of the present time for treating of such atrocious 
relations as that 3 ft. =1 yd., 54 yds. =1 rd., 30} sq. yds. =1 
sq. rd., etc. So long as this free and independent people 
chooses to be tied down to such relics of barbarism, the arith- 
matician cannot do otherwise than supply the means of acquir- 
ing the precious knowledge. 
At the beginning of the nineteenth century there were three 
“great arithmeticians” in the United States: Nicholas Pike, 
Daniel Adams, and Nathan Daboll. The arithmetics of Adams 
(1801) and of Daboll (1800) paid more attention than that of 
Pike to Federal Money. Peter Parley tells us that in conse- 
quence of the general use, for over a century, of Dilworth in 
American schools, pounds, shillings, and pence were classical, 
and dollars and cents vulgar for several succeeding generations. 
“T would not give a penny for it” was genteel; “I would not 
give a cent for it” was plebeian. 
Reform in arithmetical teaching in the United States did 
not begin until the publication by Warren Colburn, in 1821,

School System, p. 102.

of the Intellectual Arithmetic.' This was the first fruit of 
Pestalozzian ideas on American soil. Like Pestalozzi, Col- 
burn’s great success lay in the treatment of mental arithmetic. 
The success of this little book was extraordinary. But Ameri- 
can teachers in Colburn’s time, and long after, never quite 
succeeded in successfully engrafting Pestalozzian principles 
on written arithmetic. Too much time was assigned to arith- 
metic in schools. There was too little object-teaching; either 
too much abstruse reasoning,’ or no reasoning at all; too little 
attention to the art of rapid and accurate computation; too 
much attention to the technicalities of commercial arithmetic. 
During the last ten years, however, desirable reforms have 
been introduced.® 
“ Pleasant and Diverting Questions” 
In English and American editions of Dilworth, as also in 
Daniel Adams’s Scholar’s Arithmetic* we find a curious col- 
lection of “Pleasant and diverting questions.” We have all 
heard of the farmer, who, having a fox, a goose, and a peck 
of corn, wished to cross a river; but, being able to carry 
only one at a time, was confounded as to how he should take

them across so that the fox should not devour the goose, nor 
the goose the corn. Who has not been entertained by the 
problem, how three jealous husbands with their wives may 
cross a river in a boat holding only two, so that none of the 
three wives shall be found in company of one or two men 
unless her husband be present? Who has not attempted to 
place nine digits in a square so that any three figures in a 
line may make just 15? None of us, perhaps, at first sus- 
pected the great antiquity of these apparently new-born 
creatures of fancy. Some of these puzzles are taken by 
Dilworth from Kersey’s edition of Wingate. Kersey refers 
the reader to “the most ingenious ” Gaspar Bachet de Méziriac 
in his little book, Problémes plaisants et délectables qui se font 
par les nombres (Lyons, 1624), which is still largely read. 
The first of the above puzzles was probably known to Charle- 
magne, for it appears in Alcuin’s (?) Propositiones ad acuendos 
juvenes, in the modified version of the wolf, goat, and cabbage 
puzzle. The three jealous husbands and their wives were 
known to Tartaglia, who also proposes the same question with 
four husbands and four wives.'| We take these to be modified 
and improved versions of the first problem. The three jealous 
husbands have been traced back toa MS. of the thirteenth 
century, which represents two German youths, Firri and 
Tyrri, proposing problems to each other.? The MS. contains 
also the following: Firri says: “There were three brothers in 
Cologne, having nine vessels of wine. ‘The first vessel con- 
tained one quart (amam), the second 2, the third 3, the 
fourth 4, the fifth 5, the sixth 6, the seventh 7, the eighth 
8, the ninth 9. Divide the wine equally among the three 
brothers, without mixing the contents of the vessels.” This

question is closely related to the third problem given above, 
since it gives rise to the following magic square demanded by 
that problem. 
Magic squares were known to the Arabs and, perhaps, to 
the Hindus. To the Byzantine writer, Moschopulus, who lived 
in Constantinople in the early part of the fifteenth 
century, appears to be due the introduction into 
Europe of these curious and ingenious products 
of mathematical thought. Medieval astrologers 
believed them to possess mystical properties and 
when engraved on silver plate to be a charm against plague. 
The first complete magic square which has been discovere' 
in the Occident is that of the German painter, Albrecht Direr, 
found on his celebrated wood-engraving, ‘“ Melancholia.” 
Of interest is the following problem, given in Kersey’s 
Wingate: “15 Christians and 15 Turks, being at sea in one 
and the same ship in a terrible storm, and the pilot declaring 
a necessity of casting the one half of those persons into the 
sea, that the rest might be saved; they all agreed, that the 
persons to be cast away should be set out by lot after this 
manner, viz. the 30 persons should be placed in a round form 
like a ring, and then beginning to count at one of the pas- 
sengers, and proceeding circularly, every ninth person should 
be cast into the sea, until of the 30 persons there remained 
only 15. The question is, how those 30 persons ought to be 
placed, that the lot might infallibly fall upon the 15 Turks 
and not upon any of the 15 Christians?” Kersey lets the 
letters a, e, 7, 0, w stand, respectively, for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 
gives the verse

The vowels in these lines, taken in order, indicate alter- 
nately the number of Christians and Turks to be placed to- 
gether; ie., take o=4 Christians, then wu =5 Turks, then 
e=2 Christians, ete. Bachet de Méziriac, Tartaglia, and 
Cardan give each different verses to represent the rule. <Ac- 
cording to a story related by Hegesippus,' the famous historian 
Josephus, the Jew, while in a cave with 40 of his country- 
men, who had fled from the conquering Romans at the siege 
of Jotapata, preserved his life by an artifice like the above. 
Rather than be taken prisoners, his countrymen resolved to 
kill one another. Josephus prevailed upon them to proceed 
by lot and managed it so that he and one companion remained. 
Both agreed to live. 
The problem of the 15 Christians and 15 Turks has been 
called by Cardan Ludus Joseph, or Joseph’s Play. ‘It has 
been found in a French work of 1484 written by Nicolas 
Chuquet? and in MSS. of the twelfth, eleventh, and tenth 
centuries. Daniel Adams gives in his arithmetic the follow- 
ing stanza: 
** As I was going to St. Ives, 
I met seven wives. 
Every wife had seven sacks; 
Every sack had seven cats ; 
Every cat had seven kits : 
Kits, cats, sacks, and wives, 
How many were going to St. Ives?” 
Compare this with Fibonaci’s “Seven old women go to Rome,” 
etc., and with the problem in the Ahmes papyrus, and we 
perceive that of all problems in “mathematical recreations ” 
this is the oldest.

of the eighteenth centuries. In Germany this subject found 
entrance into arithmetic during the sixteenth century. Its 
aim was to make arithmetic more attractive. In the seven-

wholly devoted to this subject. 
Certain writers have found amusement in speculations over

  ALGEBRA 
  The Renaissance 
One of the great steps in the development of algebra during 
the sixteenth century was the algebraic solution of cubic 
equations. The honour of this remarkable feat belongs to 
the Italians. The first successful attack upon cubic equa- 
tions was made by Scipio Ferro (died in 1526), professor 
of mathematics at Bologna. He solved cubics of the form 
w+ me =n, but nothing more is known of his solution than 
that he taught it to his pupil Floridus in 1505. It was the 
practice in those days and during centuries afterwards for 
teachers to keep secret their discoveries or their new methods 
of treatment, in order that pupils might not acquire this 
knowledge, except at their own schools, or in order to secure 
an advantage over rival mathematicians by proposing prob- 
lems beyond their reach. This practice gave rise to many 
disputes on the priority of inventions. One of the most 
famous of these quarrels arose in connection with the dis- 
covery of cubics, between Tartaglia and Cardan. In 1530 
one Colla proposed to Tartaglia several problems, one leading 
to the equation a+ px*=g. The latter found an imperfect 
method of resolving this, made known his success, but kept 
1 The geometric solution had been given previously by the Arabs.

-P-A-G-E-233
  THE RENAISSANCE 225 
his solution secret. This led Ferro’s pupil Floridus to pro- 
claim his knowledge of how to solve a&+ma=n. Tartaglia 
challenged him to a public contest to take place Feb. 22, 1535. 
Meanwhile he worked hard, attempting to solve other cases 
of cubic equations, and finally succeeded, ten days before the 
appointed date, in mastering the case a= ma+n. At the 
contest each man proposed 30 problems. The one who should 
be able to solve the greater number within fifty days was to 
be the victor. Tartaglia solved his rival’s problems in two 
hours; Floridus could not solve any of Tartaglia’s. Thence- 
forth Tartaglia studied cubic equations with a will, and in 
1541 he was in possession of a general solution. His fame 
began to spread throughout Italy. It is curious to see what 
interest the enlightened public took in contests of this sort. 
A mathematician was honoured and admired for his ability. 
Tartaglia declined to make known his method, for it was his 
aim to write a large work on algebra, of which the solution 
of cubics should be the crowning feature. But a scholar of 
Milan, named Hieronimo Cardano (1501-1576), after many 
solicitations and the most solemn promises of secrecy, suc- 
ceeded in obtaining from Tartaglia the method. Cardan 
thereupon inserted it in a mathematical work, the Ars Magna, 
then in preparation, which he published in 1545. This breach 
of promise almost drove Tartaglia mad. His first step was 
to write a history of his invention, but to completely annihi- 
late Cardan, he challenged him and his pupil Ferrari to a 
contest. Tartaglia excelled in his power of solving problems, 
but was treated unfairly. The final outcome of all this was 
that the man to whom we owe the chief contribution to 
algebra made in the sixteenth century was forgotten, and the 
discovery in question went by the name of Cardan’s solution. 
Cardan was a good mathematician, but the association of 
his name with the discovery of the solution of cubics is a 
Q

  226 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
gross historical error and a great injustice to the genius of 
Tartaglia. 
The success in resolving cubics incited mathematicians to 
extraordinary efforts toward the solution of equations of 
higher degrees. The solution of equations of the fourth degree 
was effected by Cardan’s pupil, Lodovico Ferrari. Cardan 
had the pleasure of publishing this brilliant discovery in the 
Ars Magna of 1545. Ferrari’s solution is sometimes ascribed 
to Bombelli, who is no more the discoverer of it than Cardan 
is of the solution called by his name. For the next three 
centuries algebraists made innumerable attempts to discover 
algebraic solutions of equations of higher degree than the 
fourth. It is probably no great exaggeration to say that every 
ambitious young mathematician sooner or later tried his 
skill in this direction. At last the suspicion arose that this 
problem, like the ancient ones of the quadrature of the circle, 
duplication of the cube, and trisection of an angle, did not 
admit of the kind of solution sought. To be sure, particu- 
lar forms of equations of higher degrees could be solved satis- 
factorily. For instance, if the coefficients are all numbers, 
some method like that of Vieta, Newton, or Horner, always 
enables the computor to approximate to the numerical values 
of the roots. But suppose the coefficients are letters which 
may stand for any number whatever, and that no relation is 
assumed to exist between these coefficients, then the problem 
assumes more formidable aspects. Finally it occurred to a 
few mathematicians that it might be worth while to try to 
prove the impossibility of solving the quintic algebraically ; 
that is, by radicals. Thus, an Italian physician, Paolo Ruffini 
(1765-1822), printed proofs of their insolvability,’ but these 
proofs were declared inconclusive by his countryman Malfatti.

Ruffini” in Zeitschr. f. Math. u. Physik, Suppl., 1892.

THE RENAISSANCE 227 
Later a brilliant young Norwegian, Niels Henrik Abel (1802- 
1829), succeeded in establishing by rigorous proof that the 
general algebraic equation of the fifth or of higher degrees 
cannot be solved by radicals.! A modification of Abel’s proof 
was given by Wantzel.? 
Returning to the Renaissance it is interesting to observe, 
that Cardan in his works takes notice of negative roots of an 
equation (calling them /ictitious, while the positive roots are 
called real), and discovers all three roots of certain numerical 
cubies (no more than two roots having ever before been 
found in any equation). While in his earlier writings he 
rejects imaginary roots as impossible, in the Ars Magna he 
exhibits great boldness of thought in solving the problem, to 
divide 10 into two parts whose product is 40, by finding the 
answers 5+V—15 and 5—V—15, and then multiplying 
them together, obtaining 254+15=40.° Here for the first 
time we see a decided advance on the position taken by the 
Hindus. Advanced views on imaginaries were held also by 
Raphael Bombelli, of Bologna, who published in 1572 an alge- 
bra in which he recognized that the so-called irreducible case 
in cubics gives real values for the roots. 
It may be instructive to give examples of the algebraic 
notation adopted in Italy in those days.*

2 Wantzel’s proof, translated from Serret’s Cours d’ Algébre Supérieure, 
was published in Vol. IV., p. 65, of the Analyst, edited by Jorn E. Hen- 
pricks of Des Moines. While the quintic cannot be solved by radicals, a 
transcendental solution, involving elliptic integrals, was given by Hermite 
(in the Compt. Rend., 1858, 1865, 1866) and by Kronecker in 1858. A 
translation of the solution by elliptic integrals, taken from Briot and 
Bouquet’s Theory of Elliptic Functions, is likewise published in the 
Analyst, Vol. V., p. 161. 8 CanTor, II., 508.

The Italians were in the habit of calling the unknown 
quantity cosa, “thing.” In Germany this word was adopted 
as early as the time of John Widmann as a name for algebra: 
“he speaks of the “Regel Algobre oder Cosse”; in England 
this new name for algebra, the cossic art, gave to the first 
English work thereon, by Robert Recorde, its punning title 
the Whetstone of Witte, truly a cos ingenii. The Germans made 
important contributions to algebraic notation. The + and — 
signs, mentioned by us in the history of arithmetic, were, of 
course, introduced into algebra, but they did not pass into gen- 
eral use before the time of Vieta. “It is very singular,” says 
Hallam, “that discoveries of the greatest convenience, and, 
apparently, not above the ingenuity of a village schoolmaster, 
should have been overlooked by men of extraordinary acuteness 
like Tartaglia, Cardan, and Ferrari; and hardly less so that, by 
dint of that acuteness, they dispensed with the aid of these 
contrivances in which we suppose that so much of the utility 
of algebraic expression consists.” Another important symbol 
introduced by the Germans is the radical sign. In a manu- 
script published some time in the fifteenth century, a dot 
placed before a number is made to signify the extraction of a 
root of that number. Christof? Rudolff, who wrote the earliest 
text-book on algebra in the German language (printed 1525), 
remarks that “the radix quadrata is, for brevity, designated 
in his algorithm with the character ./, as \/4.” Here the dot 
found in the manuscript has grown into a symbol much like 
our own. With him VVV and VV stand for the cube and
-P-A-G-E-237
  THE RENAISSANCE 229 
the fourth roots. The symbol ./ was used by Michael Stifel 
(1486 ?-1567), who, in 1553, brought out a second edition of 
Rudolff’s Coss, containing rules for solving cubic equations, 
derived from the writings of Cardan. Stifel ranks as the 
greatest German algebraist of the sixteenth century. He was 
educated in a monastery at Esslingen, his native place, and 
afterwards became a Protestant minister. Study of the 
significance of mystic numbers in Revelation and in Daniel 
drew him to mathematics. He studied German and Italian 
works, and in 1544 published a Latin treatise, the Arithmetica 
Integra, given to arithmetic and algebra. Therein he observes 
the advantage in letting a geometric series correspond to an 
arithmetic series, remarking that it is possible to elaborate a 
whole book on the wonderful properties of numbers depending 
on this relation. He here makes a close approach to the idea 
of a logarithm. He gives the binomial coefficients arising in 
the expansion of (a+ b) to powers below the 18th, and uses 
these coefficients in the extraction of roots. German notations 
are illustrated by the following: 
Regiomontanus: 16 census et 2000 equales 680 rebus, 
16 x + 2000 = 680 a. 
Stifel: ./3-+/320—4— V8, VV20 — 4-8. 
The greatest French algebraist of the sixteenth century was 
Franciscus Vieta (1540-1603). He was a native of Poitou and 
died in Paris. He was educated a lawyer; his manhood he 
spent in public service under Henry III. and Henry IV. To 
him mathematics was a relaxation. Like Napier, he does not 
profess to be a mathematician. During the war against Spain, 
he rendered service. to Henry IV. by deciphering intercepted 
letters written in a cipher of more than 500 characters with 
variable signification, and addressed by the Spanish court to
-P-A-G-E-238
  230 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
their governor of Netherlands. The Spaniards attributed the 
discovery of the key to magic. Vieta is said to have printed 
all his works at his own expense, and to have distributed them 
among his friends as presents. His In Artem Analyticam 
Tsagoge, Tours, 1591, is the earliest work giving a symbolical 
treatment of algebra. Not only did he improve the.algebra 
and trigonometry of his time, but he applied algebra to geom- 
etry to a larger extent, and in a more systematic manner, than 
had been done before him. He gave also the trigonometric 
solution of Cardan’s irreducible case in cubies. 
In the solution of equations Vieta persistently employed 
the principle of reduction and thereby introduced a uniformity 
of treatment uncommon in his day. He reduces affected quad- 
ratics to pure quadratics by making a suitable substitution 
for the removal of the term containing x. Similarly for cubics 
and biquadratics. _Vieta arrived at a partial knowledge of 
the relations existing between the coeflicients and the roots 
of an equation. Unfortunately he rejected all except positive 
roots, and could not, therefore, fully perceive the relations 
in question. His nearest approach to complete recognition of 
the facts is contained in the statement that the equation 
wo —(u+ 0+ w)x? + (uv + vw + wu)e — ww = 0 has the three 
roots u, ¥, w. For cubies, this statement is perfect, if u, v, w, are 
allowed to represent any numbers. But Vieta is in the habit 
of assigning to letters only positive values, so that the passage 
really means less than at first sight it appears to do. As 
early as 1558 Jacqués Peletier (1517-1582), a French text-book 
writer on algebra and geometry, observed that the root of an 
equation is a divisor of the last term. Broader views were 
held by Albert Girard (1590-1633), a noted Flemish mathema- 
tician, who in 1629 issued his Invention nowvelle en Valgebre. 
1 HanxEt, p. 379,
-P-A-G-E-239
THE RENAISSANCE 231 
He was the first to understand the use of negative roots in the 
solution of geometric problems. He spoke of imaginary quan- 
tities, and inferred by induction that every equation has as 
many roots as there are units in the number expressing its 
degree. He first showed how to express the sums of their 
products in terms of the coefficients. The sum of the roots, 
giving the coefficient of the second term with the sign changed, 
he called the premiere faction; the sum of the products of 
the roots, two and two, giving the coefficient of the third term, 
he called deuaiéme faction, etc. In case of the equation 
a'—4¢+3=0, he gives the roots a, =1, #,=1, 2,=—1+V—2, 
®,=—1—-V—2, and then states that the imaginary roots are 
serviceable in showing the generality of the law of formation 
of the coefficients from the roots.!_ Similar researches on the 
theory of equations were made in England independently by 
Thomas Harriot (1560-1621). His posthumous work, the 
Artis Analytice Praxis, 1631, was written long before Girard’s 
Invention, though published after it. Harriot discovered the 
relations between the roots and the coefficients of an equation 
in its simplest form. This discovery was therefore made 
about the same time by Harriot in England, and by Vieta 
and Girard on the continent. Harriot was the first to decom- 
pose equations into their simple factors, but as he failed to 
recognize imaginary, or even negative roots, he failed to prove 
that every equation could be thus decomposed. 
Harriot was the earliest algebraist of England. After grad- 
uating from Oxford, he resided with Sir Walter Raleigh as 
his mathematical tutor? Raleigh sent him to Virginia as 
surveyor in 1585 with Sir Richard Grenville’s expedition. 
After his return, the following year, he published “A Brief 
and True Report of the New-found Land of Virginia,” which 
1 Canror, II., 788. 2 Dictionary of National Biography.
-P-A-G-E-240
232 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
excited much notice and was translated into Latin. Among 
the mathematical instruments by which the wonder of the 
Indians was aroused, Harriot mentions “a perspective glass 
whereby was showed many strange sights.”’ About this 
time, Henry, Earl of Northumberland, became interested in 
Harriot. Admiring his affability and learning, he allowed 
Harriot a life-pension of £300 a year. In 1606 the Earl was 
committed to the Tower, but his three mathematical friends, 
Harriot, Walter Warner, and Thomas Hughes, “the three 
magi of the Earl of Northumberland,” frequently met there, 
~ and the Earl kept a handsome table for them. Harriot was 
in poor health, which explains, perhaps, his failure to complete 
and publish his discoveries. 
We next summarize the views regarding the negative and 
imaginary, held by writers of the sixteenth century and 
the early part of the seventeenth. Cardan’s “pure minus” 
and his views on imaginaries were in advance of his age. 
Until the beginning of the seventeenth century mathemati- 
cians dealt exclusively with positive quantities. Pacioli says 
that “minus times minus gives plus,” but applies this only 
to the formation of the product of (a—b)(c—d). Purely 
negative quantities do not appear in his work. The German 
“Cossist,” Rudolff, knows only positive numbers and positive 
roots, notwithstanding his use of the signs + and —. His 
successor, Stifel, speaks of negative numbers as “less than 
nothing,” also as “absurd numbers,” which arise when real 
numbers above zero are subtracted from zero.? Harriot is 
the first who occasionally places a negative term by itself on 
one side of an equation. Vieta knows only positive numbers,   
  1 Harriot was an astronomer as well as mathematician, and he ‘ applied 
the telescope to celestial purposes almost simultaneously with Galileo.” 
His telescope magnified up to 50 times. See the Dic. of Nat. Biography.

-P-A-G-E-241
THE RENAISSANCE 233 
out Girard had advanced views, both on negatives and imagi- 
naries. Before the seventeenth century, the majority of the 
great European algebraists had not quite risen to the views 
taught by the Hindus. Only a few can be said, like the 
Hindus, to have seen negative roots; perhaps all Europeans, 
like the Hindus, did not approve of the negative. The full 
interpretation and construction of negative quantities and the 
systematic use of them begins with René Descartes (1596- 
1650), but after him erroneous views respecting them appear 
again and again. In fact, not until the middle of the nine- 
teenth century was the subject of negative numbers properly 
explained in school algebras. The question naturally arises, 
why was the generalization of the concept of number, so as 
to include the negative, such a difficult step? The answer 
would seem to be this: Negative numbers appeared “absurd” 
or “fictitious,” so long as mathematicians had not hit upon 
a visual or graphical representation of them. The Hindus early 
saw in “opposition of direction” on a line an interpretation 
of positive and negative numbers. The ideas of “assets” and 
“debts” offered to them another explanation of their nature. 
In Europe full possession of these ideas was not acquired 
before the time of Girard and Descartes. To Stifel is due the 
absurd expression, negative numbers are “less than nothing.” 
It took about 300 years to eliminate this senseless phrase from 
mathematical language. 
History emphasizes the importance of giving graphical 
representations of negative numbers in teaching algebra. 
Omit all illustration by lines, or by the thermometer, and 
negative numbers will be as absurd to modern students as 
they were to the early algebraists. 
In the development of symbolic algebra great services were 
rendered by Vieta. Epoch-making was the practice intro- 
duced by him of denoting general or indefinite expressions
-P-A-G-E-242
234 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
by letters of the alphabet. To be sure, Stifel, Cardan, and 
others used letters before him, but Vieta first made them an 
essential part of algebra. The new symbolic algebra was 
called by him logistica speciosa in opposition to the old logistica 
numerosa. By his notation a®+ 30% +3ah?+b?=(a + b) 
was written “a cubus + } in a quadr. 3+ a in b quadr. 34+0 
cubo equalia a+ cubo.” The vinculum was introduced by 
him as a sign of aggregation. Parentheses first occur with 
Girard. In numerical equations the unknown quantity was de- 
noted by N, its square by Q, and its cube by C. Illustrations :* 
Vieta: 1C0—8Q+16N equ. 40, 2 —82°+162%= 40.

Girard: 1@~x 13@+12, @=134%+12. 
Descartes: «°* + pu +qx0, e+ pe+q=0. 
Our sign of equality, =,is due to Recorde. Harriot adopted 
small letters of the alphabet in place of the capitals used by 
Vieta. Harriot writes a’ —3ab?=2c thus: aaa — 3 bba 
=2ccc. The symbols of inequality, > and <, were intro- 
duced by him. William Oughtred (1574-1660) introduced 
x asa symbol of multiplication, :: for proportion, ~ for dif- 
ference. In his Clavis, 1631, he writes A! thus, Aggcc; and 
120 A’E® thus, 120 AqgeHe. The sign: for ratio was used by 
Vincent Wing in 1651; the symbol « for variation, by William 
Emerson in 1768. 
The Last Three Centuries 
The first steps toward the building up of our modern 
theory of exponents and our exponential notation were taken 
by Simon Stevin (1548-1620) of Bruges in Belgium. Oresme’s 
previous efforts in this direction remained wholly, unnoticed, 
1 Marruiessen, pp. 270, 871.
-P-A-G-E-243
THE LAST THREE CENTURIES 235 
but Stevin’s innovations, though neglected at first, are a 
permanent possession. His exponential notation grew in 
connection with his notation for decimal fractions. Denoting 
the unknown quantity by ©, he places within the circle the 
exponent of the power. Thus @, @), ® signify a, a’, a. He 
extends his notation to fractional exponents. @),@®, @®, mean 
a, at, x. He writes 3ayz* thus 3@ M sec @ M ter @), where 
M means multiplication; sec, second; ter, third unknown 
quantity. The © for x was adopted by Girard. Stevin’s 
great independence of mind is exhibited in his condemnation 
of such terms as “sursolid,” or numbers that are “absurd,” 
“irrational,” “irregular,” “surd.” He shows that all num- 
bers are equally proper expressions of some length, or some 
power of the same root. He also rejects all compound ex- 
pressions, such as “square-squared,’ “cube-squared,” and 
suggests that they be named by their exponents the “fourth,” 
“fifth” powers. Stevin’s symbol for the unknown failed to 
be adopted, but the principle of his exponential notation has 
survived. The modern formalism took its shape with Des- 
cartes. In his Geometry, 1637, he uses the last letters of the 
alphabet, « in the first place, then the letters y, z to designate 
unknown quantities; while the first letters of the alphabet are 
made to stand for known quantities. Our exponential nota- 
tion, a‘, is found in Descartes; however, he does not use gen- 
eral exponents, like a", nor negative and fractional ones. In 
this last respect he did not rise to the ideas of Stevin. In case 
of radicals he does not indicate the root by indices, but in 
case of cube root, for instance, uses the letter C, thus, 
VOF+4q= V34 
Of the early notations for evolution, two have come down 
to our time, the German radical sign and Stevin’s fractional 
1 Cantor, II, 794.
-P-A-G-E-244
236 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
exponents. Modern pupils have to learn the algorithm for 
both notations; they must learn the meaning of V/a?, and also 
of its equal a. It isa great pity that this should be so. The 
operations with fractional exponents are not always found easy, 
and the rules for radicals are always pronounced “hard.” By 
learning both, the progress of the pupil is unnecessarily re- 
tarded. Of the two, the exponential notation is immeasurably 
superior. Radicals appear only in evolution.! Exponents, on 
the other hand, apply to both involution and evolution; with 
them all operations and simplifications are effected with com- 
parative ease. In case of radicals, what a gain it would be, if 
we could burst the chains which tie us to the past! 
Descartes enriched the theory of equations with a theorem 
which goes by the name of “rule of signs.” By it are deter- 
mined the number of positive and negative roots of an equation: 
the equation may have as many + roots as there are variations 
in sign, and as many — roots as there are permanences in sign. 
Descartes was accused by Wallis of availing himself, without 
acknowledgment, of Harriot’s theory of equations, particularly 
his mode of generating equations; but there seems to be no 
good ground for the charge. Wallis claimed, moreover, that 
Descartes failed to notice that the rule breaks down in case of 
imaginary roots, but Descartes does not say that the equation 
always has, but that it may have, so many roots. It is true 
that Descartes does not consider the case of imaginaries 
directly ; but further on, in his Geometry, he gives ample evi- 
dence of his ability to handle the case of imaginaries. 
1In connection with the imaginary, V—1, the radical notation is 
objectionable, because it leads students and even authors to remark that 
the rules of operation for real quantities do not always hold for imagi- 
naries, since V— 1. V—1 does not equal V+ 1. That the difficulty is 
merely one of notation is evident from the fact that it disappears when 
we designate the imaginary unit by i. Then i-¢=7#, which, by 
definition, equals — 1.
-P-A-G-E-245
  THE LAST THREE CENTURIES 237 
John Wallis (1616-1703) was an English mathematician of 
great originality. He was educated for the Church, at Cam- 
bridge, and took Holy Orders, but in 1649 was appointed 
Savilian professor of geometry at Oxford. He advanced 
beyond Kepler by making more extended use of the “law of 
continuity,” applying it to algebra, while Desargues applied 
it to geometry. By this law Wallis was led to regard the 
denominators of fractions as powers with negative exponents. 
For the descending geometrical progression 2’, 2!, °, if con- 
tinued, gives a, a~*, ete.; which is the same thing as _ = 
ete. The exponents of his geometric series are in the arith- 
metical progression 2, 1,0, —1, —2. He also used fractional 
exponents, which had been invented long before, but had 
failed to be generally introduced. The symbol o for infinity 
is due to him. In 1685 Wallis published an Algebra which 
has long been a standard work of reference. It treats of the 
history, theory, and practice of arithmetic and algebra. The 
historical part is unreliable and worthless, but in other respects 
the work is a masterpiece, and wonderfully rich in material. 
The study of some results obtained by Wallis on the quad- 
rature of cutrves led Newton to the discovery of the Binomial 
Theorem, made about 1665, and explained in a letter written 
by Newton to Oldenburg on June 13, 1676.1. Newton’s reason- 
ing gives the development of (a +6)", whether n be positive 
or negative, integral or fractional. Except when n is a positive 
integer, the resulting series is infinite. He gave no regular 
proof of his theorem, but verified it by actual multiplication. 
The case of positive integral exponents was proved by James 
Bernoulli’ (1654-1705), by the doctrine of combinations. A 
1 How the Binomial Theorem was deduced as a corollary of Wallis’s 
results is explained in Cajori’s History of Mathematics, pp. 195, 196. 
2 Ars Oonjectandi, 1718, p. 89.
-P-A-G-E-246
  238 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
proof for negative and fractional exponents was given by 
Leonhard Euler (1707-1783). It is faulty, for the reason that 
he fails to consider the convergence of the series; nevertheless 
it has been reproduced in elementary text-books even of recent 
years.! A rigorous general proof of the Binomial Theorem, 
embracing the case of incommensurable and imaginary powers, 
was given by Niels Henrik Abel.’ It thus appears that for over 
acentury and a half this fundamental theorem went without 
adequate proof.* 
Sir Isaac Newton (1642-1727) is probably the greatest mathe- 
matical mind of all times. Some idea of his strong intuitive 
powers may be obtained from the fact that as a youth he 
regarded the theorems of ancient geometry as self-evident 
truths, and that, without any preliminary study, he made 
himself master of Descartes’ Geometry. He afterwards re- 
garded this neglect of elementary geometry as a mistake, and 
once expressed his regret that “he had applied himself to the 
works of Descartes and other algebraic writers before he had 
considered the Elements of Euclid with the attention that so 
excellent a writer deserves.” During the first nine years of °

tiania, 1839, I., 66 et seq. 
8 It should be mentioned that the beginnings of the Binomial Theorem 
for positive integral exponents are found very early. The Hindus and 
Arabs used the expansions of (a + b)? and (a4 + 6)? in the extraction of 
square and cube root. Vieta knew the expansion of (a + b)*. But these 
were obtained by actual multiplication, not by any law of expansion. 
Stifel gave the coefficients for the first 18 powers; Pascal did similarly 
in his ‘arithmetical triangle’? (see Cantor, IL, 685, 686). Pacioli, 
Stevin, Briggs, and others also possessed something, from which one 
would think the Binomial Theorem could have been derived with a little 
attention, ‘if we did not know that such simple relations were difficult 
to discover’? (De Morgan).

his professorship at Cambridge he delivered lectures on alge- 
bra. Over thirty years after, they were published, in 1707, by 
Mr. Whiston under the title, Arithmetica Universalis. They 
contain new and important results on the theory of equations. 
His theorem on the sums of powers of roots is well known. 
We give a specimen of his notation: 
a +2 aac — aab — 3 abe + bbe. 
Elsewhere in his works he introduced the system of literal 
indices. The Arithmetica Universalis contains also a large 
number of problems. Here is one (No. 50): “A stone falling 
down into a well, from the sound of the stone striking the 
bottom, to determine the depth of the well.” He leaves his 
problems with the remark which shows that methods of teach- 
ing secured some degree of attention at his hands: “ Hitherto 
I have been solving several problems. For in learning the 
sciences examples are of more use than precepts.” * 
1 Newton’s body was interred in Westminster Abbey, where in 1731 
a fine monument was erected to his memory. In cyclopedias, the 
statement is frequently made that the Binomial Formula was engraved 
upon Newton’s tomb, but this is very probably not correct, for the 
following reasons: (1) We have the testimony of Dr. Bradley, the 
Dean of Westminster, and of mathematical acquaintances who have 
visited the Abbey and mounted the monument, that the theorem can 
not be seen on the tomb at the present time. Yet all Latin inscriptions 
are still distinctly readable. (2) None of the biographers of Newton 
and none of the old guide-books to Westminster Abbey mention the 
Binomial Formula in their (often very full) descriptions of Newton’s 
tomb. However, some of them say, that on a small scroll held by two 
winged youths in front of the half-recumbent figure of Newton, there are 
some mathematical figures. See Neale’s Guide. Brewster, in his Life of 
Sir Isaac Newton, 1831, says that a ‘‘ converging series’? is there, but 
this does not show now. Brewster would surely have said ‘‘ Binomial 
Theorem ”’ instead of ‘‘ converging series’? had the theorem been there. 
The Binomial Formula, moreover, is not always convergent. (8) It 
is important to remember that whatever was engraved on the scroll 
could not be seen and read by any one, unless he stood on a chair or
-P-A-G-E-248
240 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
The principal investigators on the solution of numerical 
equations are Vieta, Newton, Lagrange, Joseph Fourier, and 
Horner. Before Vieta, Cardan applied the Hindu rule 
of “false position” to cubics, but his method was crude. 
Vieta gave a process which is laborious, but is the forerunner 
of the easy methods of Newton and Horner.! The later 
changes are in the arrangement of the work, so as to afford 
facility and security in the evolution of the root. Horner’s 
process is the one usually taught. William George Horner 
(1786-1837), of Bath, the son of a Wesleyan minister, was 
educated at Kingswood School, near Bristol. His m 
was read before the Royal Society, July 1, 1819.2 Almost 
precisely the same method was given by the Italian Paolo 
Ruffini in 1804. Neither Ruffini nor Horner knew that their 
method had been given by the Chinese as early as the thir- 
teenth century. De Morgan admired Horner’s method and per- 
fected it in details still further. It was his conviction that it 
should be included in the arithmetics; he taught it to his 
classes, and derided the examiners at Cambridge who ignored 
the method.* De Morgan encouraged students to carry out 
used a step-ladder. Whatever was written on the scroll was, therefore, 
not noticed by transient visitors. The persons most likely to examine 
everything carefully would be the writers of the guide-books and the 
biographers — the very ones who are silent on the Binomial Theorem. On 
the other hand, such a writer as E. Stone, the compiler of the New Math- 
ematical Dictionary, London, 1743, is more likely to base his statement 
that the theorem is ‘‘ put upon the monument,’’ upon hearsay. (4) We 
have the positive testimony of a most accurate writer, Augustus De 
Morgan, that the theorem is not inscribed. Unfortunately we have no- 
where seen his reasons for the statement. See his article ‘‘ Newton”’ in 
the Penny or the English Cyclopedia. See also our article in the Bull.

long arithmetical computations for the sake of acquiring skill 
and rapidity. Thus, one of his pupils solved 2°—2a%=5 to 
103 decimal places, “another tried 150 places, but broke down 
at the 76th, which was wrong.”? While, in our opinion, De 
Morgan greatly overestimated the value of Horner’s method 
to the ordinary boy, and, perhaps, overdid in matters of 
calculation, it is certainly true that in America teachers 
have gone to the other extreme, neglecting the art of rapid 
computation, so that our school children have been con- 
spicuously wanting in the power of rapid and accurate fig- 
uring. 
In this connection we consider the approximations to the 
value of z. The early European computors followed the

2 The following, quoted by Mr. E. M. Langley in the Eighteenth Gen- 
eral Report of the A. I. G. T., 1892, p. 40, from De Morgan’s article ‘On 
Arithmetical Computation’? in the Companion to the British Almanac 
for 1844, is interesting: ‘‘The growth of the power of computation on 
the Continent, though considerable, did not keep pace with that of the 
same in England. We might give many instances of the truth of our 
assertion. In 1696 De Lagny, a well-known writer on algebra, and a 
member of the Academy of Sciences, said that the most skilful computor 
could not, in less than a month, find within a unit the cube root of 
696536483318640035073641037. We would have given something to have 
been present if De Lagny had ever made the assertion to his contempo- 
rary, Abraham Sharp. In the present day, however, both in our uni- 
versities at home and everywhere abroad, no disposition to encourage 
computation exists among those who attend to the higher branches of 
mathematics, and the elementary works are very deficient in numerical 
examples.’? De Lagny’s example was brought to De Morgan in a class, 
and he found. the root to five decimals in less than twenty minutes. Mr. 
Langley exhibits De Morgan’s computation on p. 41 of the article cited. 
Mr. Langley and Mr. R. B. Hayward advocate Horner’s method as a 
desirable substitute for ‘‘ the clumsy rules for evolution which the young 
student still usually encounters in the text-books.’? See Haywarp’s

geometrical method of Archimedes by inscribed or circum- 
scribed polygons. Thus Vieta, about 1580, computed to ten 
places, Adrianus Romanus (1561-1615), of Louvain, to 15 
places, Ludolph van Ceulen (1540-1610) to 35 places. The 
latter spent years in this computation, and his performance 
was considered so extraordinary that the numbers were cut 
on his tombstone in St. Peter’s churchyard at Leyden. The 
tombstone is lost, but a description of it is extant. After him, 
the value of z is often called “Ludolph’s number.” In the 
seventeenth century it was perceived that the computations 
could be greatly simplified by the use of infinite series. Such 
-1 5 7 
a series, viz. tan’ eae T4224. was first sug- 
gested by James Gregory in 1671. Perhaps the easiest are the 
formule used by Machin and Dase. Machin’s formula is, 
a, aaelt eee —=4tan Roe 339° 
The Englishman, Abraham Sharp, a skilful mechanic, and 
computor, for a time assistant to the astronomer Flamsteed, 
took the are in Gregory’s formula equal to 30°, and calculated 
x to 72 places in 1705; next year Machin, professor of astron- 
omy in London, gave z to 100 places; the Frenchman, De 
Lagny, about 1719, gave 127 places; the German, Georg Vesa, 
in 1793, 140 places; the English, Rutherford, in 1841, 208 
places (152 correct); the German, Zacharias Dase, in 1844, 
205 places; the German, Th. Clausen, in 1847, 250 places; the 
English, Rutherford, in 1853, 440 places; William Shanks, in 
1873, 707 places. It may be remarked that these long com- 
putations are of no theoretical or practical value. Infinitely 
more interesting and useful are Lambert’s proof of 1761

that a is not rational,! and Lindemann’s proof that 7 is not 
algebraical, #.e. cannot be the root of an algebraic equation. 
Infinite series by which 7 may be computed were given also 
by Hutton and Euler. Leonhard Euler (1707-1783), of Basel, 
contributed vastly to the progress of higher mathematics, but 
his influence reached down to elementary subjects. He treated 
trigonometry as a branch of analysis, introduced (simultane- 
ously with Thomas Simpson in England) the now current 
abbreviations for trigonometric functions, and simplified for- 
mule by the simple expedient of designating the angles of 
a triangle by A, B, C, and the opposite sides by a, b,c In 
his old age, after he had become blind, he dictated to his 
servant his Anleitung zwr Algebra, 1770, which, though purely 
elementary, is meritorious as one of the earliest attempts to put 
the fundamental processes upon a sound basis. An Introduction 
to the Elements of Algebra, . . . selected from the Algebra of Euler, 
was brought out in 1818 by John Farrar of Harvard College. 
A question that became prominent toward the close of the 
eighteenth century was the graphical representation and inter- 
pretation of the imaginary, V—1. As with negative numbers, 
so with imaginaries, no decided progress was made until a 
picture of it was presented to the eye. In the time of Newton, 
Descartes, and Euler, the imaginary was still an algebraic 
fiction. The first thoroughly successful graphic representations 
were described by the Norwegian surveyor, Caspar Wessel, in an 
article of 1797, published in 1799 in the Memoirs of the Danish 
R. Academy of Sciences, and by Jean Robert Argand (1768-?), 
.of Geneva, who in 1806 published a remarkable Essai? But

all these writings were little noticed, and it remained for the 
great Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855), of Gottingen, to break 
down the last opposition to the imaginary. He introduced 
it as an independent unit co-ordinate to 1, and a+ ib as a 
“complex number.’ Notwithstanding the acceptance of imagi- 
naries as “numbers” by all great investigators of the nine- 
teenth century, there are still text-books which represent the 
obsolete view that V— 1 is not a number or is not a quantity. 
Clear ideas on the fundamental principles of algebra were 
not secured before the nineteenth century. As late as the 
latter part of the eighteenth century we find at Cambridge, 
England, opposition to the use of the negative.' The view 
was held that there exists no distinction between arithmetic 
and algebra. In fact, such writers as Maclaurin, Saunderson, 
Thomas Simpson, Hutton, Bonnycastle, Bridge, began their 
treatises with arithmetical algebra, but gradually and dis- 
guisedly introduced negative quantities. Early American 
writers imitated the English. But in the nineteenth century 
the first principles of algebra came to be carefully investi- 
gated by George Peacock,’ D. F. Gregory,? De Morgan.t Of 
continental writers we may mention Augustin Louis Cauchy 
(1789-1857),> Martin Ohm,° and especially Hermann Hankel.’

by the epoch-making researches of William Rowan Hamilton,

new algebras with laws differing from the laws of ordinary 
algebra.* 
GEOMETRY AND TRIGONOMETRY 
Editions of Euclid. Early Researches 
With the close of the fifteenth century and beginning of 
the sixteenth we enter upon a newera. Great progress was 
made in arithmetic, algebra, and trigonometry, but less prom- 
inent were the advances in geometry. Through the study of 
Greek manuscripts which, after the fall of Constantinople in 
1453, came into possession of Western Europe, improved trans- 
lations of Euclid were secured. At the beginning of this 
period, printing was invented ; books became cheap and plenti- 
ful. The first printed edition of Euclid was published in 
Venice, 1482. This was the translation from the Arabie by 
Campanus. Other editions of this appeared, at Ulm in 1486, 
at Basel in 1491. The first Latin edition, translated from 
the original Greek, by Bartholomeus Zambertus, appeared at 
Venice in 1505. In it the translation of Campanus is severely 
criticised. This led Pacioli, in 1509, to bring out an edition, 
the tacit aim of which seems to have been to exonerate Cam- 
panus.? Another Euclid edition appeared in Paris, 1516. The 
first edition of Euclid printed in Greek was brought out in 
Basel in 1533, edited by Simon Grynwus. For 170 years this 
was the only Greek text. In 1703 David Gregory brought 
out at Oxford all the extant works of Euclid in the original.

246 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
As a complete edition of Euclid, this stood alone until 1883, 
when Heiberg and Menge began the publication, in Greek 
and Latin, of their edition of Euclid’s works. ‘he first 
English translation of the Hlements was made in 1570 from 
the Greek by “H. Billingsley, Citizen of London.”? An 
English edition of the Elements and the Data was published 
in 1758 by Robert Simson (1687-1768), professor of mathe- 
matics at the University of Glasgow. His text was until 
recently the foundation of nearly all school editions. It dif- 
fers considerably from the original. Simson corrected a num- 
ber of errors in the Greek copies. All these errors he assumed 
to be due to unskilful editors, none to Euclid himself. A close 
English translation of the Greek text was made by James 
Williamson. The first volume appeared at Oxford in 1781; 
the second volume in 1788. School editions of the Elements 
usually contain the first six books, together with the eleventh 
and twelfth. 
Returning to the time of the Renaissance, we mention a few 
1In the General Dictionary by Bayt, London, 1735, it says that 
Billingsley ‘‘made great progress in mathematics, by the assistance of 
his friend, Mr. Whitehead, who, being left destitute upon the dissolution 
of the monasteries in the reign of Henry VIII., was received by Billings- 
ley into his family, and maintained by him in his old age in his house at 
London.” Billingsley was rich and was Lord Mayor of London in 1591. 
Like other scholars of his day, he confounded our Euclid with Euclid of 
Megara. The preface to the English edition was written by John Dee, 
a famous astrologer and mathematician. An interesting account of Dee 
is given in the Dictionary of National Biography. De Morgan thought 
that Dee had made the entire translation, but this is denied in the article 
“Billingsley ’’ of this dictionary. At one time it was believed that Bil- 
lingsley translated from an Arabic-Latin version, but G. B. Halsted suc- 
ceeded in proving from a folio— once the property of Billingsley — [now 
in the library of Princeton College, and containing the Greek edition of 
1583, together with some other editions] that Billingsley translated from 
the Greek, not the Latin. See ‘‘ Note on the First English Euclid’ in 
the Am. Jour. of Mathem., Vol. L1., 1879.

of the more interesting problems then discussed in geometry. 
Of a development of new geometrical methods of investigation 
we find as yet no trace. In his book, De triangulis, 1533, the 
German astronomer, Regiomontanus, gives the theorem (already 
known to Proclus) that the three perpendiculars from the ver- 
tices of a triangle meet in a point; and shows how to find from 
the three sides the radius of the circumscribed circle. He gives 
the first new maximum problem considered since the time of 
Apollonius and Zenodorus, viz., to find the point on the floor 
(or-rather the locus of that point) from which a vertical 10 
foot rod, whose lower end is 4 feet above the floor, seems 
largest (i.e. subtends the largest angle). New is the following 
theorem, which brings out in bold relief a fundamental differ- 
ence between the geometry on a plane and the geometry on a 
sphere: From the three angles of a spherical triangle may be 
computed the three sides, and vice versa. Regiomontanus dis- 
cussed also star-polygons. He was probably familiar with the 
writings on this subject of Campanus and Bradwardine. Regi- 
omontanus, and especially the Frenchman, Charles de Bouvelles, 
or Carolus Bovillus (1470-1533), laid the foundation for the 
theory of regular star-polygons.? 
The construction of regular inscribed polygons received the

2 A detailed history of star-polygons and star-polyedra is given by 
S. Ginruer, Vermischte Untersuchungen, pp. 1-92. Star-polygons have 
commanded the attention of geometers down even to recent times. 
Among the more prominent are Petrus Ramus, Athanasius Kircher 
(1602-1680), Albert Girard, John Broscius (a Pole), John Kepler, A. L. 
F. Meister (1724-1788), C. F. Gauss, A. F. Mobius, L. Poinsot (1777- 
1859), C. C. Krause. Mébius gives the following definition for the area 
of a polygon, useful in case the sides cross each other: Given an arbi- 
trarily formed plane polygon AB... MN; assume any point P in the 
plane and connect it with the vertices by straight lines; then the sum 
PAB+ PBC+...+PMN+ PNA is independent of the position of 
P and represents the area of the polygon. Here PAB =— PBA.

attention of the great painter and architect, Leonardo da Viner 
(1452-1519). Of his methods some are mere approximations, 
of no theoretical interest, though not without practical value. 
His inscription of a regular heptagon (of course, merely an 
approximation) he considered to be accurate! Similar construc- 
tions were given by the great German painter, Albrecht Diirer, 
(1471-1528). He is the first who always clearly and correctly 
states which of the constructions are approximations.! Both 
Leonardo da Vinci and Diirer in some cases perform a construc- 
tion by using one single opening of the compasses. Pappus 
once set himself this limitation; Abfl Wafa did this repeat- 
edly; but now this method becomes famous. It was used by 
Tartaglia in 67 different constructions; it was employed also 
by his pupil Giovanni Battista Benedetti (1530-1590).? 
It will be remembered that Greek geometers demanded that 
all geometric constructions be effected by a ruler and compasses 
only; other methods, which have been proposed from time to 
time, are to construct by the compasses only or by the ruler 
only,’ or by ruler, compasses, and other additional instruments. 
Constructions of the last class were given by the Greeks, but 
were considered by them mechanical, not geometric. A peculiar 
feature in the theory of all these methods is that elementary

pretty method is reached in Stemer, Die Gieometrischen Constructionen,

geometry is unable to answer the general question, What con- 
structions can be carried out by either one of these methods ? 
For an answer we must resort to algebraic analysis.’ 
A construction by other instruments than merely the ruler 
and compasses appears in the quadrature of the circle by Leo- 
nardo da Vinci. He takes a cylinder whose height equals half 
.its radius; its trace on a plane, resulting from one revolution, 
is a rectangle whose area is equal to that of the circle. Nothing 
could be simpler than this quadrature; only it must not be 
claimed that this solves the problem as the Greeks understood 
it. The ancients did not admit the use of a solid cylinder as an 
instrument of construction, and for good reasons: while with a 
ruler we can easily draw a line of any length, and, with an or- 
dinary pair of compasses, any circle needed in a drawing, we 
can with a given cylinder effect not a single construction of 
practical value. No draughtsman ever thinks of using a 
cylinder.? 
To Albrecht Diirer belongs the honour of having shown how 
the regular and the semi-regular solids can be constructed out 
of paper by marking off the bounding polygons, all in one 
piece, and then folding along the connected edges.* 
Polyedra were a favourite study with John Kepler. In 
1596, at the beginning of his extraordinary scientific career, he 
made a pseudo-discovery which brought him much fame. He 
placed the icosaedron, dodecaedron, octaedron, tetraedron, and 
cube, one within the other, at such distances that each polye- 
dron was inscribed in the same sphere, about which the next 
outer one was circumscribed. On imagining the sun placed in 
the centre and the planets moving along great circles on the 
spheres — taking the radius of the sphere between the icosae-

dron and dodecaedron equal to the radius of the earth’s orbit 
— he found the distances between these planets to agree roughly 
with astronomical observations. This reminds us of Pythag- 
orean mysticism. But maturer reflection and intercourse 
with Tycho Brahe and Galileo led him to investigations and 
results more worthy of his genius — “ Kepler’s laws.” Kepler 
greatly advanced the theory of star-polyedra.! An innova- 
tion in the mode of geometrical proofs, which has since 
been widely used by European and American writers of 
elementary books, was introduced by the Frenchman, Francis- 
cus Vieta. He considered the circle to be a polygon with 
an infinite number of sides.? The same view was taken by 
Kepler. In recent times this geometrical fiction has been 
generally abandoned in elementary works; a circle is not a 
polygon, but the limit of a polygon. To advanced mathema- 
ticians Vieta’s idea is of great service in simplifying proofs, 
and by them it may be safely used. 
The revival of trigonometry in Germany is chiefly due to 
John Miiller, more generally called Regiomontanus (1436-1476). 
At Vienna he studied under the celebrated Georg Purbach, 
who began a translation, from the Greek, of the Almagest, 
which was completed by Regiomontanus. The latter also 
translated from the Greek works of Apollonius, Archimedes, 
and Heron. Instead of dividing the radius into 3438 parts, 
in Hindu fashion, Regiomontanus divided it into 600,000 
equal parts, and then constructed a more accurate table of 
sines. Later he divided the radius into 10,000,000 parts. 
The tangent had been known in Europe before this to the 
Englishman, Bradwardine, but Regiomontanus went a step 
further, and calculated a table of tangents. He published a

EARLY RESEARCHES 251 
treatise on trigonometry, containing solutions of plane and 
spherical triangles. The form which he gave to trigonometry 
has been retained, in its main features, to the present day. 
The task of computing accurate tables was continued by 
the successors of Regiomontanus. More refined astronomical 
instruments furnished observations of greater precision and 
necessitated the computation of more extended tables of 
trigonometric functions. Of the several tables calculated, 
that of Georg Joachim of Feldkirch in Tyrol, generally called 
Rheeticus, deserves special mention. In one of his sine-tables, 
he took the radius = 1,000,000,000,000,000 and proceeded from 
10" to 10”. He began also the construction of tables of 
tangents and secants. For twelve years he had in continual 
employment several calculators. The work was completed by 
his pupil, Valentin Otho, in 1596. A republication was made 
by Pitiseus in 1613. These tables are a gigantic monument 
of German diligence and perseverance. But Rheticus was 
not a mere computor. Up to his time the trigonometric 
functions had been considered always with relation to the 
arc; he was the first to construct the right triangle and to 
make them depend directly upon its angles. It was from the 
right triangle that he took his idea of calculating the hypot- 
enuse, i.e. the secant. His was the first European table of 
secants. Good work in trigonometry was done also by Vieta, 
Adrianus Romanus, Nathaniel Torporley, John Napier, Wille- 
brord Snellius, Pothenot, and others. . An important geodetic 
problem — given a terrestrial triangle and the angles subtended 
by the sides of the triangle at a point in the same plane, to 
find the distances of the point from the vertices — was solved 
by Snellius in a work of 1617, and again by Pothenot in 1730. 
Snellius’s investigation was forgotten and it secured the name 
of “Pothenot’s problem.” The word “radian” is due to 
James Thomson, 1871.

252 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
The Beginning of Modern Synthetic Geometry 
About the beginning of the seventeenth century the first 
decided advance, since the time of the ancient Greeks, was 
made in Geometry. Two lines of progress are noticeable: 
(1) the analytic path, marked out by the genius of Descartes, 
the inventor of Analytical Geometry; (2) the synthetic path, 
with the new principle of perspective and the theory of trans- 
versals. he early investigators in modern synthetic geome- 
try are Desargues, Pascal, and De Lahire. 
Girard Desargues (1593-1662), of Lyons, was an architect 
and engineer. Under Cardinal Richelieu he served in the 
siege of La Rochelle, in 1628. Soon after, he retired to Paris, 
where he made his researches in geometry. Esteemed by the 
ablest of his contemporaries, bitterly attacked by others unable 
to appreciate his genius, his works were neglected and forgot- 
ten, and his name fell into oblivion until, in the early part of 
the nineteenth century, it was rescued by Brianchon and 
Poncelet. Desargues, like Kepler and others, introduced the 
doctrine of infinity into geometry.’ He states that the straight 
line may be regarded as a circle whose centre is at infinity ; 
hence, the two extremities of a straight line may be considered 
as meeting at infinity; parallels differ from other pairs of 
lines only in having their points of intersection at infinity. 
He gives the theory of involution of six points, but his 
definition of “involution” is not quite the same as the modern 
definition, first found in Fermat,? but really introduced into 
geometry by Chasles.* On a line take the point A as origin 
(souche), take also the three pairs of points B and H, C and 
G, D and F; then, says Desargues, if AB- AH= AC. AG

= AD - AF, the six points are in “involution.” Ifa point falls 
on the origin, then its partner must be at an infinite distance 
from the origin. If from any point P lines be drawn through 
the six points, these lines cut any transversal MW in six other 
points, which are also in involution; that is, involution is a 
projective relation. Desargues also gives the theory of polar 
lines. What is called “Desargues’ Theorem” in elementary 
works is as follows: If the vertices of two triangles, situated 
either in space or in a plane, lie on three lines meeting in a 
AsaB: c D Fe G H 
P 
point, then their sides meet in three points lying on a line, and 
conversely. This theorem has been used since by Brianchon, 
Sturm, Gergonne, and others. Poncelet made it the basis of 
his beautiful theory of homological figures. 
Although the papers of Desargues fell into neglect, his ideas 
were preserved by his disciples, Pascal and Philippe de Lahire. 
The latter, in 1679, made a complete copy of Desargues’ princi- 
pal research, published in*1639. Blaise Pascal (1623-1662) 
was one of the very few contemporaries who appreciated the 
worth of Desargues. He says in his Essais pour les coniques, 
“T wish to acknowledge that I owe the little that I have dis- 
covered on this subject to his writings.” Pascal’s genius for 
geometry showed itself when he was but twelve years old. 
His father wanted him to learn Latin and Greek before enter- 
ing on mathematics. All mathematical books were hidden 
out of sight. In answer to a question, the boy was told by
-P-A-G-E-262
254 » A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
his father that mathematics “was the method of making 
figures with exactness, and of finding out what proportions 
they relatively had to one another.” He was at the same time 
forbidden to talk any more about it. But his genius could 
not be thus confined; meditating on the above definition, he 
drew figures with a piece of charcoal upon the tiles of the 
pavement. He gave names of his own to these figures, 
then formed axioms, and, in short, came to make perfect 
demonstrations. In this way he arrived, unaided, at the 
theorem that the angle-sum in a triangle is two right angles. 
His father caught him in the act of studying this theorem, and 
was so astonished at the sublimity and force of his genius as 
to weep for joy. The father now gave him Euclid’s Elements, 
which he mastered easily. Such is the story of Pascal’s early 
boyhood, as narrated by his devoted sister.! While this narra- 
tive must be taken cum grano salis (for it is highly absurd to 
suppose that young Pascal or any one else could re-discover 
geometry as far as Euclid I., 32, following the same treatment 
and hitting upon the same sequence of propositions as found 
in the Elements), it is true that Pascal’s extraordinary pene- 
tration enabled him at the age of sixteen to write a treatise on 
conics which passed for such a surprising effort of genius that 
it was said nothing equal to it in power had been produced 
since the time of Archimedes. Descartes refused to believe 
that it was written by one so young as Pascal. This treatise 
was never published, and is now lost. Leibniz saw it in Paris, 
recommended its publication, and reported on a portion of its 
contents.? However, Pascal published in 1640, when he was 
sixteen years old, a small geometric treatise of six octavo

pages, bearing the title, Essais pour les coniques. Constant 
application at a tender age greatly impaired Pascal’s health. 
During his adult life he gave only a small part of his time to 
the study of mathematics. 
Pascal’s two treatises just noted contained the celebrated 
proposition on the mystic hexagon, known as “Pascal’s 
Theorem,” viz. that the opposite sides of a hexagon inscribed 
in a conic intersect in three points which are collinear. In 
our elementary text-books on modern geometry this beautiful 
theorem is given in connection with a very special type of a 
conic, namely, the circle. As, in one sense, any two straight 
lines may be looked upon as a special case of a conic, the 
theorem applies to hexagons whose first, third, and fifth ver- 
tices are on one line, and whose second, fourth, and sixth ver- 
tices are on the other. It is interesting to note that this 
special case of “Pascal’s Theorem” occurs already in Pappus 
(Book VIL, Prop. 139). Pascal said that from his theorem 
he deduced over 400 corollaries, embracing the conics of 
Apollonius and many other results. Pascal gave the theorem 
on the cross ratio, first found in Pappus.! This wonderfully 
fruitful theorem may be stated as follows: Four lines in a 
plane, passing through one common point, cut off four seg- 
ments on a transversal which have a fixed, constant ratio, in 
whatever manner the transversal may be drawn; that is, if 
the transversal cuts the rays in the points .A, B, C, D, then the 
ACB a : 3C formed by the four segments AC, AD, BO, 
BD, is the same for all transversals. The researches of 
Desargues and Pascal uncovered several of the rich treasures ratio ——

256 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
of modern synthetic geometry; but owing to the absorbing 
interest taken in the analytical geometry of Descartes, and, 
later, in the differential calculus, the subject was almost en- 
tirely neglected until the close of the eighteenth century. 
Synthetic geometry was advanced in England by the re- 
searches of Sir Isaac Newton, Roger Cotes (1682-1716), and 
Colin Maclaurin, but their investigations do not come within 
the scope of this history. Robert Simson and Matthew Stewart 
(1717-1785) exerted themselves mainly to revive Greek ge- 
ometry. An Italian geometer, Giovanni Ceva (1647-1734)! 
deserves mention here; a theorem in elementary geometry 
bears his name. He was an hydraulic engineer, and as such 
was several times employed by the government of Mantua. 
His death took place during the siege of Mantua, in 1734. He 
ranks as a remarkable author in economics, being the first 
clear-sighted mathematical writer on this subject. In 1678 he 
published in Milan a work, De lineis rectis. This contains 
“Ceva’s Theorem ” with one static and two geometric proofs: 
Any three concurrent lines A 
through the vertices of a triangle B i 
———e divide the opposite sides so that 
c EE gp Cu-AB-By=Ba- Op. Ay. In 
2 Ceva’s book the properties of rec- 
tilinear figures are proved by considering the properties of 
the centre of inertia (gravity) of a system of points.”

methods of research, the second division refers to new theorems 
in elementary geometry, the third considers the modern con-

from, the fourth discusses questions pertaining to geometrical 
teaching. 
I. Modern Synthetic Geometry.—It was reserved for the 
genius of Gaspard Monge (1746-1818) to bring modern synthetic 
geometry into the foreground, and to open up new avenues 
of progress. To avoid the long arithmetical computations in 
connection with plans of fortification, this gifted engineer sub- 
stituted geometric methods and was thus led to the creation of 
descriptive geometry as a distinct branch of science. Monge 
was professor at the Normal School in Paris during the four 
months of its existence, in 1795; he then became connected 
with the newly established Polytechnic School, and later 
accompanied Napoleon on the Egyptian campaign. Among 
the pupils of Monge were Dupin, Servois, Brianchon, Hachette, 
Biot, and Poncelet. Charles Julien Brianchon, born in Sévres 
in 1785, deduced the theorem, known by his name, from 
“Pascal’s Theorem” by means of Desargues’ properties of 
what are now called polars.'. Brianchon’s theorem says: “The 
hexagon formed by any six tangents to a conic has its opposite 
vertices connecting concurrently.” The point of meeting is. 
sometimes called the “ Brianchon point.” 
Lazare Nicholas Marguerite Carnot (1753-1823) was born at 
Nolay in Burgundy. At the breaking out of the Revolution 
he threw himself into politics, and when coalesced Europe, in 
1793, launched against France a million soldiers, the gigantic

task of organizing fourteen armies to meet the enemy was 
achieved by him. He was banished in 1796 for opposing 
Napoleon’s coup détat. His Geometry of Position, 1803, and 
his Essay on Transversals, 1806, are important contributions 
to modern plane geometry. By his effort to explain the mean- 
ing of the negative sign in geometry he established a “ geome- 
try of position” which, however, is different from Von Staudt’s 
work of the same name. He invented a class of general theo- 
rems on projective properties of figures, which have since been 
studied more extensively by Poncelet, Chasles, and others. 
Jean Victor Poncelet (1788-1867), a native of Metz, engaged 
in the Russian campaign, was abandoned as dead on the 
bloody field of Krasnoi, and from there taken as prisoner to 
Saratoff. Deprived of books, and reduced to the remem- 
brance of what he had learned at the Lyceum at Metz and 
the Polytechnic School, he began to study mathematics from 
its elements. Like Bunyan, he produced in prison a famous 
work, Traité des Propriétés projectives des Figures, first pub- 
lished in 1822. Here he uses central projection, and gives 
the theory of “reciprocal polars.’ To him we owe the Law 
of Duality as a consequence of reciprocal polars. As an inde- 
pendent principle it is due to Joseph Diaz Gergonne (1771- 
1859). We can here do no more than mention by name a few 
of the more recent investigators: Augustus Ferdinand Mobius 
(1790-1868), Jacob Steiner (1796-1863), Michel Chasles (1793- 
1880), Karl Georg Christian von Staudt (1798-1867). Chasles 
introduced the bad term anharmonic ratio, corresponding to 
the German Doppelverhiltniss and to Clifford’s more desirable 
cross-ratio. Von Staudt cut loose from all algebraic formule 
and from metrical relations, particularly the metrically founded 
cross-ratio of Steiner and Chasles, and then created a geom- 
etry of position, which is a complete science in itself, inde- 
pendent of all measurement.

II. Modern Geometry of the Triangle and Circle. — We can- 
not give a full history of this subject, but we hope by our 
remarks to interest a larger circle of American readers in the 
recently developed properties of the triangle and circle.’ Fre- 
quently quoted in recent elementary geometries is the “nine- 
point circle.” In the triangle ABC, let D, E, F be the middle 
points of the sides, let AL, 
BM, CN be perpendicu- 
lars to the sides, let a, 6, 
ce be the middle points of 
AO, BO, CO, then a cir- 
cle can be made to pass 
through the points, L, D, 
c, E, M, a, N, F, b; this 
circle is the “nine-point 
circle.” By mistake, the earliest discovery of this circle 
has been attributed to Euler? There are several indepen- 
dent discoverers. In England, Benjamin Bevan proposed in 
Leybourn’s Mathematical Repository, I., 18, 1804, a theorem 
for proof which practically gives us the nine-point circle. 
  1 A systematic treatise on this subject, which we commend to students 
is A. Emmericn’s Die Brocardschen Gebilde, Berlin, 1891. Our historical 
notes are taken from this book and from the following papers: Jurius 
Lancer, Geschichte des Feuerbachschen Kreises, Berlin, 1894; J. S. 
Mackay, History of the nine-point circle, pp. 19-57, Early history of 
the symmedian point, pp. 92-104, in the Proceed. of the Edinburgh 
Math. Soc., Vol. XI., 1892-93. See also Mackay, The Wallace line 
and the Wallace point in the same journal, Vol. IX., 1891, pp. 88-91;

Sciences, Congrés de Grenoble, 1885; E. Vicarré, in the same publica- 
tion, Congrés de Paris, 1889. The progress in the geometry of the tri- 
angle is traced by Viearré for the year 1890 in Progreso mat. I., 101-106, 
128-134, 187-190; for the year 1891 in Journ. de Math. élém., (4) 1.

260 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
The proof was supplied to the Repository, Vol. I., Part 1, 
p. 143, by John Butterworth, who also proposed a problem, 
solved by himself and John Whitley, from the general tenor 
of which it appears that they knew the circle in question 
to pass through all nine points. These nine points are explic- 
itly mentioned by Brianchon and Poncelet in Gergonne’s 
Annales de Mathématiques of 1821. In 1822, Karl Wilhelm 
Feuerbach (1800-1834) professor at the gymnasium in Erlangen, 
published a pamphlet in which he arrives at the nine-point 
circle, and proves that it touches the incircle and the ex- 
circles. The Germans called it “Feuerbach’s Circle.” Many 
demonstrations of its characteristic properties are given in the 
article above referred to. The last independent discoverer of 
this remarkable circle, so far as known, is F. 8. Davies, in an 
article of 1827 in the Philosophical Magazine, II., 29-31. 
In 1816 August Leopold Crelle (1780-1855), the founder of 
a mathematical journal bearing his name, published in Berlin 
a paper dealing with certain properties of plane triangles. 
He showed how to determine a point Q inside a triangle, so 
that the angles (taken in the same order) formed by the lines 
joining it to the vertices are equal. 
In the adjoining figure the three marked angles are equal. 
If the construction be made so as to 
give angle Q'AC = 0'CB = 0'BA, then 
a second point Q!' is obtained. The 
study of the properties of these new 
angles and new points led Crelle to 
B iC exclaim: “It is indeed wonderful that 
so simple a figure as the triangle is so 
inexhaustible in properties. How many as yet unknown 
properties of other figures may there not be!”  Investiga- 
tions were made also by C. F. A. Jacobi of Pforta and some 
of his pupils, but after his death, in 1855, the whole matter   A
-P-A-G-E-269

was forgotten. In 1875 the subject was again brought before 
the mathematical public by H. Brocard, who had taken up 
this study independently a few years earlier. The work of 
Brocard was soon followed up by a large number of investi- 
gators in France, England, and Germany. The new researches 
gave rise to an extended new vocabulary of technical terms. 
Unfortunately, the names of geometricians which have been 
attached to certain remarkable points, lines, and circles are not 
always the names of the men who first studied their properties. 
Thus, we speak of “ Brocard points” and “ Brocard angles,” but 
  
  historical research brought out the fact, in 1884, and 1886, that 
these were the points and lines which had been studied by 
Crelle and C. F. A. Jacobi. The “Brocard Circle,” is Brocard’s 
own creation. In the triangle ABC, let 0 and 0’ be the first 
and second “Brocard point.” Let A’ be the intersection of 
BQ and CQ'; B', of AQ! and CQ; C', of BQ' and AQ. The 
circle passing through A’, B', C! is the “Brocard circle.” 
A'B'C' is “Brocard’s first triangle.” Another like triangle, 
A"B''C" is called “Brocard’s second triangle.” The points 
A", B", C" together with Q, 0', and two other points, lie in 
the circumference of the “Brocard circle.”
-P-A-G-E-270
262 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
In 1873 Emile Lemoine called attention to a particular point 
within a plane triangle which since has been variously called 
the “Lemoine point,” “symmedian point,” and “Grebe point.” 
Since that time the properties of this point and of the lines 
and circles connected with it have been diligently investigated. 
To lead up to its definition we premise that, in the adjoining 
figure, if CD is so drawn as to make angles a and b equal, then 
if one of the two lines AB and CD 
' is the anti-parallel of the other, 
with reference to the angle 0. 
Now OE, the bisector of AB, 
is the median and OF, the bisec- 
tor of the anti-parallel of AB, 
is called the symmedian (ab- 
breviated from symétrique de la 
médiane). The point of concurrence of the three symmedians 
in a triangle is called, after Tucker, the “symmedian point.” 
Mackay has pointed out that some of the properties of this 
point, recently brought to light, were discovered previously 
to 1873. The anti-parallels of a triangle which pass through 
its symmedian point, meet its sides in six points. which lie 
on a circle, called the “second Lemoine circle.” The “first 
Lemoine circle” is a special case of a “Tucker circle” and 
concentric with the “Brocard circle.” The “Tucker circles” 
may be thus defined. Let DF'= FE'= ED’; let, moreover, 
the following pairs of lines be anti-parallels to each other: 
  1 The definition of anti-parallels is attributed by Emmericu (p. 18, note) 
to Leibniz. The term anti-parallel is defined by E. Sronx in his New 
Mathem. Dict., London, 1743. Stone gives the above definition, refers 
to Leibniz in Acta Frudit., 1691, p. 279, and attributes to Leibniz a 
definition different from the above. The word anti-parallel is given in 
Morray’s New English Dictionary of about 1660. See Jahrbuch iiber 
die Fortschritte der Mathematik, Bd. XXII., 1890, p. 45; Nature, XLI., 
104-105.

AB and ED', BC and FE', CA and DF'; then the six points 
D, D', E, E', F, F', lie on a “Tucker circle.” Vary the 
length of the equal anti-parallels, 
and the various “Tucker cir- 
eles” are obtained. Allied to 
these are the “Taylor circles.” 
Still different types are the 
“Neuberg circles” and “ Mac- 
kay circles.” Perhaps enough 
has been said to call to mind the 
wonderful advance which has 
been made in the geometry of 
the triangle and circle during 
the latter half of the nineteenth century. That new theorems 
should have been found in recent time is the more remark- 
able when we consider that these figures were subjected to 
close examination by the keen-minded Greeks and the long 
; line of geometers who 
ip have since appeared.’ 
Of interest is the in- 
vention in 1853 by Sarrut 
of an apparatus for gener- 
ating rectilinear motions ; 
it has been altogether 
overlooked. Celebrated 
is the invention in 1864 
of an apparatus for con- 
verting circular into recti- 
linear motion,? by A. Peaucellier, a French army officer. Let

ACBP be a rhombus whose sides are less than the equal sides 
of the angle AOB. Imagine the straight lines which are 
drawn in full to be bars or “links,” jointed at the points .A, B, 
C, P,Q, O. Make C describe the circle and P will describe 
the straight line PD, the pivot O being fixed.’ Remove CQ, 
let C move along any curve in the plane, then P will trace the 
inverse of that curve with respect to O. Peaucellier’s method 
of linkages was developed further by Sylvester. 
Elsewhere we have spoken of the instruments used in 
geometrical constructions —how the Greeks used the ruler 
and compasses, and how later a ruler with a fixed opening 
of the compasses, or the ruler alone, came to be used by a 
few geometers. Of interest in this connection is a work by 
the Italian Lorenzo Mascheroni (1750-1800), entitled Geome- 
tria del compasso, 1797, in which all constructions are made 
with a pair of compasses, but without restriction to a fixed 
radius. The book was written for the practical mechanic, 
the author claiming that constructions with compasses are 
more accurate than those with a ruler.2, The work secured the 
attention of Napoleon Bonaparte, who proposed to the French 
mathematicians the following problem: To divide the circum- 
ference of a circle into four equal parts by the compasses only. 
This construction is as follows: Apply the radius three times 
to the circumference, giving the ares AB, BC, CD. Then the 
distance AD is a diameter. With a radius equal to AC, and

where O is the centre of the given circle, is the chord of the

The inscription of the regular polygon of 17 sides was first 
effected by Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855), when a boy of 
nineteen, at the University of Géttingen, March 30, 1796. At 
that time he was undecided whether to choose ancient lan- 
guages or mathematics as his specialty. His success in this 
inscription led to the decision in favour of mathematics.’ 
A curious mode of construction has been suggested inde- 
pendently by a German and a Hindu. Constructions are to 
be effected by the folding of paper. Hermann Wiener, in 1893, 
showed how to construct, by folding, the nets of the regular 
solids. In the same year, Sundara Row published a little 
book “On paper folding” (Addison & Co., Madras), in which 
it is shown how to construct any number of points on the 
ellipse, cissoid, ete.? 
In connection with polyedra the theorem that the number of 
edges falls short by two of the combined number of vertices 
and faces is interesting. The theorem is usually ascribed to 
Euler, but was worked out earlier by Descartes.* It is true 
only for polyedra whose faces have each but one boundary; if 
a cube is placed upon a larger cube, then the upper face of the 
larger cube has two boundaries, an inner and an outer, and the 
theorem is not true. A more general theorem is due to 
F. Lippich* 
1 Other modes of inscription of the 17-sided polygon were given by 
Von Sraupt, in Crelle, 24 (1842), by Scurirer, in Crelle, 75 (1872). 
The latter uses a ruler and a single opening of the compasses. By the 
compasses only, the inscription has also been effected. See Kuri,

Leipzig, 1872, p. 67. 2 Kiem, p. 33.

  266 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
Ill. Non-Euclidean Geometry. — The history: of this subject 
centres almost wholly in the theory of parallel lines. Prelimi- 
nary to the discussion of the non-Euclidean geometries, it may be 
profitable to consider the various efforts towards simplifying and 
improving the parallel-theory made, (1) by giving a new defini- 
tion of parallel lines, or by assuming a new postulate, different 
from Euclid’s parallel-postulate, (2) by proving the parallel- 
postulate from the nature of the straight line and plane angle. 
Euclid’s definition, parallel straight lines are such as are in 
the same plane, and which being produced ever so far both ways 
do not meet, still holds its place as the best definition for use in 
elementary geometry. A new definition, used by Posidonius 
(1st Cent. B.c.), was adopted by the painter, Albrecht Diirer. He 
wrote a geometry, first printed in 1525, in which parallel lines 
are lines everywhere equally distant.' A little later Clavius, in 
his edition of Euclid of 1574, in a remark, assumes that a line 
which is everywhere equidistant from a straight line is it 
self straight. This postulate lies hidden in the definition of 
Diirer. The objection to this definition or postulate is that 
it is an advanced theorem, involving the difficult consider- 
ation of measurement, embracing the whole theory of incom- 
mensurables. Moreover, in a more general view of geometry 
it must be abandoned.? Clavius’s treatment is adopted by 
Jacques Peletier (1517-1582) of Paris, Ruggiero Giuseppe 
Boscovich (1711-1787),3 Johann Christian Wolf (1679-1754) 
84, 1881; see also H. Durex, Theorie der Funktionen, Leipzig, 1882, 
p. 226; an English translation of this work, made by G. E. Fiser and 
I. J. Scuwart, has appeared.

of Halle, Thomas Simpson (in the first edition of his Elements, 
1747), John Bonnycastle (1750 ?-1821) of the Royal Military 
Academy at Woolwich, and others. It has been used by a few 
American authors.! This definition is the first of several given 
by E. Stone in his New Mathematical Dictionary, London, 1743 ; 
in fact, “in the majority of text-books on elementary geome- 
try, from the sixteenth to the beginning of the eighteenth 
century, parallel lines are declared to be lines that are 
equidistant — which is, to be sure, very convenient.”? But 
objections to this mode of treatment soon arose. As early as 
1680 Giordano da Bitonto, in Italy, said that it is inadmissible, 
unless the actual existence of equidistant straight lines can 
be established. Saccheri rejects the assumption unceremoni- 
ously.’ 
Another definition, which involves a tacit assumption, de- 
clares parallels to be lines which make the same angle with 
a third line. The definition appears to have originated in 
France; it is given by Pierre Varignon (1654-1722) and 
Etienne Bézout (1730-1783), both of Paris. In England it 
was used by Cooley,‘ in the United States by H. N. Robinson. 
A slight modification of this is the following definition:

Famous is the definition, parallel lines are straight lines hav- 
ing the same direction. At first, this definition attracts us by 
its simplicity. But the more it is studied, the more perplexing 
are the questions to which it gives rise. Strangely enough, 
authors adopting this definition encounter no further diffi- 
culty with parallel lines; nowhere do they meet the necessity 
of assuming Euclid’s parallel-postulate or any equivalent of 
it! A question which has perplexed geometers for centuries 
appears disposed of in a trice! In actual fact, there is, 
perhaps, no word in mathematics which, by its apparent sim- 
plicity, but real indefiniteness and obscurity, has misled so 
many able minds. In the United States, as elsewhere, this 
definition has been widely used, but for the sake of sound 
learning, it should be banished from text-books forever.?

of continuity, and one of great assistance in advanced geome-

given by John Kepler (1604) and Girard Desargues (1639): 
Lines are parallel if they have the same infinitely distant 
point in common. A similar idea is expressed by E. Stone in 
his dictionary thus: “If A be a point without a given indefi- 
nite right line CD; the shortest line, as AB, that can be drawn 
from A to it, is perpendicular; and the longest, as EA, is 
parallel to CD.” 
Quite a number of substitutes for Euclid’s parallel-postulate 
differing in form, but not in essence, have been suggested 
at various times. In the evening of July 11, 1663, John 
Wallis delivered a lecture at Oxford on the parallel-postulate.? 
He recommends in place of Euclid’s postulate: To any triangle 
another triangle, as large as you please, can be drawn, which is 
similar to the given triangle. Saccheri showed that Euclidean 
geometry can be rigidly developed if the existence of one tri- 
angle, unequal but similar to another, be presupposed. Lam- 
bert makes similar remarks. Wallis’s postulate was again 
proposed for adoption by L. Carnot and Laplace, and more 
recently by J. Delboeuf.? Alewis Claude Clairaut (1713-1765), 
a famous French mathematician, wrote an elementary geom- 
etry, in which he asswmes the existence of a rectangle, and from 
this substitute for Euclid’s postulate develops the elementary 
theorems with great clearness. Other equivalent postulates 
are the following: a circle can be passed through any three 
points not in the same straight line (due to W. Bolyai); the 
existence of a finite triangle whose angle-sum is two right 
angles (due to Legendre) ; through every point within an angle 
a line can be drawn intersecting both sides (due to J. F. 
Lorenz (1791), and Legendre) ; in any circle, the inscribed equi- 
lateral quadrangle is greater than any one of the segments

270 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
which lie outside of it (due to C. L. Dodgson); two straight 
lines which intersect each other cannot be both parallel 
to the same straight line (used by John Playfair)! Of all 
these substitutes, only the last has met with general favour. 
Playfair adopted it in his edition of Euclid, and it has 
been generally recognized as simpler than Euclid’s parallel- 
postulate. 
Until the close of the first quarter of the nineteenth century 
it was widely believed by mathematicians that Euclid’s parallel- 
postulate could be proved from the other assumptions and the 
definitions of geometry. We have already referred to such 
efforts made by Ptolemy and Nasir Eddin. We refrain from 
discussing proofs in detail. They all fail, either because an 
equivalent assumption is implicitly or explicitly made, or 
because the reasoning is otherwise fallacious. On this slippery 
ground. good and bad mathematicians alike have fallen. We 
are told that the great Lagrange, noticing that the formule of 
spherical trigonometry are not dependent upon the parallel- 
postulate, hoped to frame a proof on this fact. Toward the 
close of his life he wrote a paper on parallel lines and began 
to read it before the Academy, but suddenly stopped and 
said: “Il faut que j’y songe encore”? (I must think it over 
again); he put the paper in his pocket and never afterwards 
publicly recurred to it. 
The researches of Adrien Marie Legendre (1752-1833) are 
interesting. Perceiving that Euclid’s postulate is equivalent 
to the theorem that the angle-sum of a triangle is two right 
angles, he gave this an analytical proof, which, however, 
assumes the existence of similar figures. Legendre was not 
satisfied with this. Later, he proved satisfactorily by assum- 
ing lines to be of indefinite extent, that the angle-sum can-

  ELEMENTARY GEOMETRY 271, 
not exceed two right angles, but could not prove that it cannot 
fall short of two right angles. In 1823, in the twelfth edition 
of his Elements of Geometry, he thought he had a proof for 
the second part. Afterwards, however, he perceived its weak- 
ness, for it rested on the new assumption that through any 
point within an angle a line can be drawn, cutting both sides 
of the angle. In 1833 he published his last paper on parallels, 
in which he correctly proves that, if there be any triangle 
the sum of whose angles is two right angles, then the same 
must be true of all triangles. But in the next step, to show 
rigorously the actual existence of such a triangle, his demon- 
stration failed, though he himself thought he had finally settled 
the whole question! As a matter of fact he had not gotten 
quite so far as had Saccheri one hundred years earlier.’ 
Moreover, before the publication of his last paper, a Russian 
mathematician had taken a step which far transcends in 
boldness and importance anything Legendre had done on this 
subject. 
As with the problem of the quadrature of the circle, so 
with the parallel-postulate: after numberless failures on the 
part of some of the best minds to resolve the difficulty, 
certain shrewd thinkers began to suspect that the postulate 
1 A novel attempt to prove the angle-sum of a triangle to be two right 
angles was made in 1813 by John Playfair, in his Elements of Geometry. 
See the edition of 1855, Philadelphia, pp. 295, 296. It consists, briefly, 
in laying a straight edge along one of the sides of the figure, and then 
turning the edge round so as to coincide with each in turn. Then the 
edge is said to have described angles whose sum is four right angles. 
The same argument proves the angle-sum of spherical triangles to be two 
right angles, a result which we know to be wrong. It is to be regretted 
that in two American text-books, just published, this argument is repro- 
duced, thus giving this famous heresy new life. For the exposition of 
the fallacy see G. B. Hatsrep’s 4th Ed. of Botyai’s Science Absolute of 
Space, pp. 63-71; Nature, Vol. XXIX., 1884, p. 453.

272 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
did not admit of proof. This scepticism appears in various 
writings.? 
If it required courage on the part of Euclid to place his 
parallel-postulate, so decidedly unaxiomatic, among his other 
postulates and common notions, even greater courage was de- 
manded to discard a postulate which for two thousand years 
had been the main corner stone of the geometric structure. 
Yet several thinkers of the eighteenth and nineteenth cen- 
turies displayed that independence of thought, so essential to 
great discoveries. 
While Legendre still endeavoured to establish the parallel- 
postulate by rigorous proof, Nicholaus Ivanovitch Lobatchewsky 
(1793-1856) brought out a publication which assumed the 
contradictory of that axiom. Lobatchewsky’s views on the 
foundation of geometry were first made public in a discourse 
before the physical and mathematical faculty of the University 
of Kasan (of which he was then rector), and first printed in 
the Kasan Messenger for 1829, and then in the Gelehrte 
Schriften der Universitit Kasan, 1836-1838, under the title 
“New Elements of Geometry, with a complete theory of 
parallels.” This work, in Russian, not only remained un- 
known to foreigners, but attracted no notice at home. In 1840 
he published in Berlin a brief statement of his researches. 
The distinguishing feature of this “Imaginary Geometry” 
of Lobatchewsky is that through a-point an indefinite number 
of lines can be drawn in a plane, none of which cut a given 
line in the plane, and that the sum of the angles in a triangle 
is variable, though always less than two right angles.”

ELEMENTARY GEOMETRY 2738 
A similar system of geometry was devised by the Bolyais in 
Hungary and called by them “absolute geometry.” Wolfgang 
Bolyat de Bolya (1775-1856) studied at Jena, then at Gottingen, 
where he became intimate with young Gauss. Later, he be- 
came professor at the Reformed College of Maros-Vasdrhely, 
where for forty-seven years he had for his pupils most of the 
present professors in Transylvania. Clad in old time planter’s 
garb, he was truly original in his private life as well as in his 
mode of thinking. He was extremely modest. No monument, 
said he, should stand over his grave, only an apple-tree, in 
memory of the three apples: the two of Eve and Paris, which 
made hell out of earth, and that of Newton, which elevated 
the earth again into the circle of heavenly bodies.' His son, 
Johann Bolyai (1802-1860) was educated for the army, and 
distinguished himself as a profound mathematician, an im- 
passioned violin-player, and an expert fencer. He once 
accepted the challenge of thirteen officers on condition that 
after each duel he might play a piece on his violin, and he 
vanquished them all. 
Wolfgang Bolyai’s chief mathematical work, the Tentamen, 
appeared in two volumes, 1832-1833. The first volume is 
followed by an appendix written by his son Johann on The 
Science Absolute of Space. Its twenty-six pages make the 
name of Johann Bolyai immortal. Yet for thirty-six years 
this appendix, as also Lobatchewsky’s researches, remained in 
almost entire oblivion. Finally Richard Baltzer, of Giessen, 
in 1867, called the attention of mathematicians to these won-

erful studies. In 1894 a monumental stone was placed on 
the long-neglected grave of Johann Bolyai in Maros-Vdsdrhely. 
In the years 1893-1895 a Lobatchewsky fund was secured 
through contributions of scientific men in all countries, which 
goes partly toward founding an international prize for re- 
search in geometry, and partly towards erecting a bust of 
Lobatchewsky in the park in front of the university building 
in Kasan. 
But the Russian and Hungarian mathematicians were not 
the only ones to whom the new geometry suggested itself. 
When Gauss saw the Tentamen of the elder Bolyai, his former 
room-mate at Géttingen, he was surprised to find worked out 
there what he himself had begun long before, only to leave it 
after him in his papers. His letters show that in 1799 he was 
still trying to prove a priori the reality of Euclid’s system, but 
later he became convinced that this was impossible. Many 
writers, especially the Germans, assume that both Lobatchew- 
sky and Bolyai were influenced and encouraged by Gauss, but 
no proof of this opinion has yet been presented." 
Recent historical investigation has shown that the theories 
of Lobatchewsky and Bolyai were, in part, anticipated by two 
writers of the eighteenth century, Geronimo Saccheri (1667— 
1733), a Jesuit father of Milan, and Johann Heinrich Lambert 
(1728-1777), a native of Miihlhausen, Alsace. Both made 
researches containing definitions of the three kinds of space, 
now called the non-Euclidean, Spherical, and the Euclidean 
geometries.”

We have touched upon the subject of non-Euclidean geome- 
try, because of the great light which these studies have 
thrown upon the foundations of geometric theory. Thanks 
to these researches, no intelligent author of elementary text- 
books will now attempt to do what used to be attempted: 
prove the parallel-postulate. We know at last that such an 
attempt is futile. Moreover, many trains of reasoning are now 
easily recognized as fallacious by one who sees with the eyes 
of Lobatchewsky and Bolyai. Possessing, as we do, English 
translations of their epoch-making works, no progressive 
teacher of geometry in High School or College —certainly no 
author of a text-book on geometry —can afford to be ignorant 
of these results. 
IV. Text-books on Elementary Geometry.— The history of 
the evolution of geometric text-books proceeds along different 
lines in the various European countries. About the time when 
Euclid was translated from the Arabic into Latin, such intense 
veneration came to be felt for the book that it was considered 
sacrilegious to modify anything therein. Still more pronounced 
was this feeling toward Aristotle. Thus we read of Petrus 
Ramus (1515-1572) in France being forbidden on pain of 
corporal punishment to teach or write against Aristotle. This 
royal mandate induced Ramus to devote himself to mathe- 
readers Halsted’s translations of Lobatchewsky and Bolyai. Georg 
Friedrich Bernhard Riemann’s wonderful dissertation of 1854, entitled 
Ueber die Hypothesen welche der Geometrie zu Grunde liegen is trans- 
lated by W. K. Clifford in Nature, Vol. 8, pp. 14-17, 36-87. Riemann 
developed the notion of n-ply extended magnitude. Helmholtz’s lecture, 
entitled ‘‘ Origin and Significance of Geometrical Axioms” is contained 
in a volume of Popular Lectures on Scientific Subjects, translated by 
E. Arxryson, New York, 1881. Consult also the works of W. K. Clifford.

matics; he brought out an edition of Euclid, and here again 
displayed his bold independence. He did not favour inves- 
tigations on the foundations of geometry; he believed that it 
was not at all desirable to carry everything back to a few 
axioms; whatever is evident in itself, needs no proof. His 
opinion on mathematical questions carried great weight. His 
views respecting the basis of geometry controlled French 
text-books down to the nineteenth century. In no other civil- 
ized country has Euclid been so little respected as in France. 
A conspicuous example of French opinion on this matter is 
the text prepared by Alewis Claude Clairaut in 1741. He con- 
demns the profusion of self-evident propositions, saying in his 
preface, “It is not surprising that Euclid should give himself 
the trouble to demonstrate that two circles which intersect 
have not the same centre; that a triangle situated within 
another has the sum of its sides smaller than that of the sides 
of the triangle which contains it. That geometer had to con. 
vince obstinate, sophists, who gloried in denying the most 
evident truths ...; but in our day things have changed face; 
all reasoning about what mere good sense decides in advance 
is now a pure waste of time and fitted only to obscure the 
truth and to disgust the reader.” This book, precisely antip- 
odal to Euclid, has contributed much toward moulding opin- 
ions on geometric teaching, but otherwise it did not enjoy a 
great success.’ Similar views were entertained by Etienne 
Bézout (1730-1783), whose geometric works, like Clairaut’s, 
are deficient in rigour. Somewhat more methodical was 
Sylvestre Francois Lacroix (1765-1843). But the French 
geometry which enjoyed the most pronounced success, both 
at home and in other countries, is that of Adrien Marie 
Legendre, first brought out in 1794. It is interesting to note

XTX Siécle par PrerrE Larousse.

    ELEMENTARY GEOMETRY 277 
Loria’s estimate of Legendre’s Eléments de géométrie. « They 
deserved it [success], since, as regards form, if they can com- 
pete with Euclid in clearness and precision of style, they are 
superior to him in the complex harmony which gives them the 
appearance of a beautiful edifice, divided into two symmetrical 
parts, assigned, the one to the geometry of the plane and the 
other to the geometry of space; and since in regard to matter, 
they surpass Euclid by being richer in material and better in 
certain particulars. But the great French analyst, in writing 
of geometry, could not forget his own favoured studies, so that 
in his hands geometry became a vassal of arithmetic, from 
which he borrowed a few ratiocinations and even some of his 
nomenclature, and took from its dominions the whole theory 
of proportions. If it is added that, while Euclid avoids the 
use of any figure, the construction of which is unknown to 
the reader, Legendre uses without scruple the so-called ‘hypo- 
thetical constructions,’ and that he gave the preference to that 
unfortunate definition of a straight line [used, moreover, even 
by Kant] as a minimum line; there is sufficient argument to 
support the fact that Legendre’s edifice was not long in show- 
ing itself of a solidity incomparably inferior to its beauty.” ? 
Thus we see that French writers, influenced by their views 
respecting methods of teaching, by their belief that what is 
apparent to the eye may be accepted by the young student 
without proof, and by their general desire to make geometry 
easier and more palatable, allowed themselves to depart a long 
way from the practice of Euclid. But Legendre is more strict 
than Clairaut; the reaction against Clairaut’s views became 
more and more pronounced, and about the middle of the nine-

teenth century, Jean Harte Constant Duhamel (1797-1872) and 
J. Hoiiel’ began to institute comparisons between Legendrian 
and Euclidean methods in favour of the latter, recommending 
the return to a modified Euclid. Duhamel proclaimed the 
method of limits to be the only rigorous one by which the use of 
the infinite can be introduced into geometry,” and contributed 
much toward imparting to that method a clear and unobjection- 
able form. Hoiiel, professor at Bordeaux, while expressing 
his regret that Euclid’s Elements had fallen into disuse in 
France, did not recommend the adoption of Euclid unmodified. 
While Duhamel’s and Hoiiel’s desired return to Euclidean 
methods did not take place, the discussion, nevertheless, led 
to improvements in geometric texts. The works which in 
France now enjoy the greatest favour are those of H. Rouché 
and C. de Comberousse, and of Ch. Vacquant.2 The treatment 
of incommensurables is by the method of limits, against which 
the ery “lack of rigour” cannot be raised. In appendices 
considerable attention is given to projective geometry, but 
Loria remarks that the old and the new in geometry are here 
not united into a coherent whole, but merely mixed in dis- 
jointed fashion.‘ 
Italy, the land where once Euclid was held in high venera- 
tion, where Saccheri wrote, in 1733, Euclides ab omni naevo 
vindicatus (Euclid vindicated from every flaw), finally discarded 
her Euclid and departed from the spirit of his Elements. In

were members of a special government commission to inquire 
into the state of geometrical teaching in Italy. They found 
it to be so unsatisfactory and the number of bad text-books so 
great and so much on the increase, that they recommended for 
classical schools the adoption of Euclid pure and simple, even 
though Cremona admitted that Euclid is faulty.'_ This recom- 
mendation becamé law. Later the use of Euclid’s text was 
replaced by that of other works, prepared on analogous plans.? 
Thereupon appeared after the amended Euclidean model, as 
distinguished from the Legendrian, the meritorious work by 
A. Sannia and E. D’ Ovidio. Later came the Elementi di 
geometria of Riccardo de Paolis and the Fondamenti di geom- 
etria of Guiseppe Veronese. 
The high esteem in which Euclid was held in Germany 
during early times is demonstrated by many facts. About the 
close of the eighteenth century Abraham Gotthelf Kastner 
remarked that “the more recent works on geometry depart 
from Euclid, the more they lose in clearness and thorough- 
ness.” This points to a falling off from the Euclidean model. 
The most popular texts in use about the middle of the nine- 
teenth century, and even those of the -present time, are, from 
a scientific point of view, anything but satisfactory. Thus 
in H. B. Litbsen’s Elementar-Geometrie, 14th Ed., Leipzig, 
1870, written in the country which produced Gauss, and at 
a time when Lobatchewsky’s and Bolyai’s immortal works 
had been published 41 and 37 years respectively, we still find 
(p. 52) a proof of the parallel-postulate!* If we bear in mind 
that geometry deals with continuous magnitudes, in which com-

8 Another illustration of the confusion which prevailed regarding the 
foundations of geometry, long after Lobatchewsky, is found in Thomas 
Peronnet Thompson’s Geometry without Axioms, 3d Ed., 1830, in which 
he endeavoured to ‘get rid’? of axioms and postulates!

mensurability is exceptional, it is somewhat startling that Lib- 
sen should make no mention of incommensurables. Another 
work which has been used for several decennia is Karl Koppe’s 
Planimetrie, 4th Ed., Essen, 1852. It speaks of parallels as 
having the same direction, and fails to consider incommen- 
surability excepting once in a foot-note. Kambly’s inferior 
work appeared in 1884 in the 74th edition.! The subject of 
geometric teaching has been much discussed in Germany. 
Some excellent text-books have been written, but they do not 
appear to be popular. Among the better works are those 
of Baltzer, Schlegel, H. Miller, Kruse, Worpitzky, Henrici 
and Treutlein.? Most of these seem to be dominated by 
Euclidean methods. One of the questions debated in Ger- 
many and elsewhere is that pertaining to the rigidity of fig- 
ures. While Euclid sometimes moves a figure as a whole, he 
never permits its parts to move relatively to one another. 
With him, figures are “rigid.” In many modern works this 
practice is abandoned. For instance, we often allow an angle 
to be generated by rotation of a line,t whereby we arrive at 
the notion of a “straight angle” (not used by Euclid), which 
now competes with the right angle as a unit for angular 
measure. The abandonment of rigidity brings us in closer 
touch with the modern geometry, and is, we think, to be 
recommended, provided that we proceed with circumspection. 
Pure projective geometry needs neither motion nor rigidity.

ELEMENTARY GEOMETRY 281 
Preparatory courses in intuitive geometry, in connection with 
geometric drawing, have been widely recommended and adopted 
in Germany. 
England has been the home of conservatism in geometric 
teaching. Wherever in England geometry has been taught, 
Euclid has been held in high esteem, It appears that the 
first to rescue the Elements from the Moors and to bring it out 
in Latin translation was an Englishman. The first English 
translation (Billingsley’s) was printed in 1570. Before this, 
Robert Recorde made a translation, but it was probably never 
published.1| Elsewhere we have spoken of medizeval geomet- 
trical teaching at Oxford. It was carried on with very limited 
success. About 1620 Sir Henry Savile (1549-1622), warden 
of Merton College, endeavoured to create an interest in mathe- 
matical studies by giving a course of lectures on Greek 
geometry. These were published in 1621. On concluding 
* the course he used the following language: “By the grace of 
God, gentlemen hearers, I have performed my promise; I 
have redeemed my pledge. I have explained, according to my 
ability, the definitions, postulates, axioms, and the first eight 
propositions of the Elements of Euclid. Here, sinking under 
the weight of years, I lay down my art and my instruments.” ? 
It must be remembered that at this time scholastic learning 
and polemical divinity held sway. Savile ranks among those 
who laboured for the revival of true knowledge. He founded 
two professorships at Oxford, one of geometry and the other 
of astronomy, and endowed each with a salary of £150 per 
annum. In the preamble to the deed by which he annexed 
this salary he says that geometry was.almost totally abandoned 
and unknown in England.

282 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
Savile delivered thirteen lectures in his course, in which 
philological and historical questions received more attention 
than did geometry itself! In one place he says, “In the 
beautiful structure of geometry there are two blemishes, two 
defects; I know no more.” These “blemishes” are the theory 
of parallels and the theory of proportion. At that time 
Euelid’s parallel-postulate was objected to as unaxiomatic 
and requiring demonstration. We now know by the light de- 
rived from non-Euclidean geometry that it is a pure as- 
sumption, incapable of proof; that a geometry exists which 
assumes its contradictory; that it separates the Euclidean 
from the pseudo-spherical geometry. No “blemish,” there- 
fore, exists on this point in Euclid’s Elements. The second 
“blemish” referred to the sixth statement in Book V.2 Peda- 
gogically, this fifth book is still criticised, on account of its 
excessive abstruseness for young minds; but scientifically 
(aside from certain unimportant emendations which Robert ° 
Simson thought necessary) this book is now regarded as one 
of exceptional merit. 
During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries a consider- 
able number of English editions of Euclid were brought out. 
These were supplanted after 1756 by Robert Simson’s Euclid. 
In the early part of the nineteenth century Euclid was still 
without a rival in Great Britain, but the desirability of modi- 
fication arose in some minds. As early as 1795, John Play- 
fair (1748-1819) brought out at Edinburgh his Elements 
of Geometry, containing the first six books of Euclid and a 
supplement, embracing an approximate quadrature of the 
circle (i.e. the computation of 7) and a book on solid geom- 
etry drawn from other sources. In the fifth book of Euclid, 
Playfair endeavours to remove Huclid’s diffuseness of style by 
1 Canror, II., 664, 2Encer and Sricket, p. 47.

introducing the language of algebra. Playfair also introduces 
a new parallel-postulate, simpler than Euclid’s. Gradually 
the advantage of more pronounced deviations from Euclid’s 
text was expressed. In 1849 De Morgan pointed out defects 
in Euclid. About twenty years later Wilson? and Jones* 
expressed the desirability of abandoning the Euclidean method. 
Finally in 1869 one of the two greatest mathematicians in 
England raised his powerful voice against Euclid. J. J. Syl- 
vester said, “I should rejoice to see . . . Euclid honourably 
shelved or buried ‘deeper than e’er plummet sounded’ out 
of the schoolboy’s reach.”* These attacks on Euclid as a school- 
book brought about no immediate change in geometrical teach- 
ing. The occasional use of Brewster’s translation of Legendre 
or of Wilson’s geometry no more indicated a departure from 
Euclid than did the occasional use, in the eighteenth century,

Huxley’s allegation that ‘‘Mathematics is that study which knows 
nothing of observation, nothing of experiment, nothing of induction, 
nothing of causation.’? We quote the following sentences from Sylves- 
ter: ‘‘I, of course, am not so absurd as to maintain that the habit of 
observation of external nature will be best or in any degree cultivated 
by the study of mathematics.’’ ‘‘ Most, if not all, of the great ideas of 
modern mathematics have had their origin in observation.’ ‘‘ Lagrange, 
than whom no greater authority could be quoted, has expressed em- 
phatically his belief in the importance to the mathematician of the 
faculty of observation ; Gauss called mathematics a science of the eye 
. ; the ever to be lamented Riemann has written a thesis to show 
that the basis of our conception of space is purely empirical, and our 
knowledge of its laws the result of observation, that other kinds of 
space might be conceived to exist subject to laws different from those 
which govern the actual space in which we are immersed.”’  
-P-A-G-E-292
  284 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
of Thomas Simpson’s geometry. One happy event, however, 
grew out of these discussions, the organization, in 1870, of 
the Association for the Improvement of Geometrical Teaching 
(A. 1.G.T.). T. A. Hirst, its first president, expressed him- 
self as follows: “I may say further, that I know no suc- 
cessful teacher who will not admit that his success is 
almost in proportion to the liberty he gives himself to 
depart from the strict line of Euclid’s Elements and to give 
the subject a life which, without that departure, it could 
not possess. I know no geometer who has read Euclid criti- 
cally, no teacher who has paid attention to modes of exposi- 
tion, who does not admit that Euclid’s Elements are full of 
defects. They ‘swarm with faults’ in fact, as was said by 
the eminent professor of this college (De Morgan), who has 
helped to train, perhaps, some of the most vigorous thinkers 
of our time.”? 
After much discussion the Association published in 1875 a 
Syllabus of Plane Geometry, corresponding to Books I-VI. of 
Euclid. It was the aim “to preserve the spirit and essentials 
of style of Euclid’s Elements; and, while sacrificing nothing 
in rigour either of substance or form, to supply acknowledged. 
deficiences and remedy many minor defects. The sequence of 
propositions, while it differs considerably from that of Euclid, 
does so chiefly by bringing the propositions closer to the fun- 
damental axioms on which they are based; and thus it does 
not conflict with Euclid’s sequence in the sense of proving 
any theorem by means of one which follows it in Euclid’s 
order, though in many cases it simplifies Euclid’s proofs by 
using a few theorems which are contained in the sequence of 
the Syllabus, but are not explicitly given by Euclid.”? The 
Syllabus received the careful consideration. of the best mathe-

matical minds in England; the British Association for the 
Advancement of Science appointed a committee to examine 
the Syllabus and to co-operate with the A.I.G.T.” In their 
report, in 1877, which favoured the Syllabus, was expressed the 
conviction that “no text-book that has yet been produced is 
fit to succeed Euclid in the position of authority.” One of 
the great drawbacks to reform was the fact that the great 
universities of Oxford and Cambridge in their examinations 
for admission insisted upon a rigid adherence to the proofs 
and the sequence of propositions as given by Euclid; thus no 
freedom was given to teachers to deviate from Euclid in any 
way. To be noted, moreover, was the total absence of “ origi- 
nals” or “riders,” or any question designed to determine the 
real knowledge of the pupil. But in the last few years the 
work of the Association has been recognized by the universi- 
ties, and some freedom has been granted. It was noted above 
that J. J. Sylvester was an enthusiastic supporter of reform. 
The difference in attitude on this question between the two fore- 
most British mathematicians, J. J. Sylvester, the algebraist, 
and Arthur Cayley, the algebraist and geometer, was grotesque. 
Sylvester wished to bury Euclid “deeper than e’er plummet 
sounded” out of the schoolboy’s reach; Cayley, an ardent 
admirer of Euclid, desired the retention of Simson’s Huclid. 
‘When reminded that this treatise was a mixture of Euclid and 
Simson, Cayley suggested striking out Simson’s additions and 
keeping strictly to the original treatise.’ 
The most difficult task in preparing the Syllabus was the 
treatment of proportion, Euclid’s Book V. The great admira- 
tion for this Book V. has been inconsistent with the practice 
in the school-room. Says Nixon, “the present custom of 
omitting Book V., though quietly assuming such of its results

teenth General Report, p. 28.

  A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
as are needed in Book VI., is singularly illogical.”! Hirst 
offers similar testimony: “The fifth book of Euclid . . . has 
invariably’ been ‘skipped,’ by all but the cleverest school- 
boys.”* Here we have the extraordinary spectacle of pro- 
portion relating to magnitudes “skipped,” by consent of 
teachers who were shocked at Legendre, because he refers the 
student to arithmetic for his theory of proportion! Is not 
this practice of English teachers a tacit acknowledgment of 
the truth of Raumer’s® assertion that as an elementary text- 
book the Elements should be rejected? Euclid himself proba- 
bly never intended them for the use of beginners. But the 
English are not prepared to follow the example of other 
nations and cast Euclid aside. The British mind advances by 
evolution, not by revolution. The British idea is to revise, 
simplify, and enrich the text of Euclid. 
The first important attempt to revise and simplify the fifth 
book was made by Augustus De Morgan. He published, in 
1836, “The Connexion of Number and Magnitude: an attempt 
to explain the fifth book of Euclid.” In 1837 it appeared as 
an appendix to his “Elements of Trigonometry.” It is on 
this revision that the substitute for Book V., given in the 
Syllabus, is modelled. On the treatment of proportion there 
was great diversity of opinion among the members of the sub- 
committee appointed by the Association to prepare this part 
of the Syllabus, and no unanimous agreement was reached.* 
There were, in the first place, different schemes for re-arrang- 
ing and simplifying Euclid’s Book V. According to Euclid four 
magnitudes, a, b, c, d, are in proportion, when for any integers

aes = hess m and n, we have simultaneously Ca and me ae A 
definition of proportion adopted by the Italians Sannia and 
D’ Ovidio was considered, according to which parts are sub- 
stituted for multiples, viz. a, 6, c, d, are in proportion, if, for 
; See ss any integer m, a contains Fi neither a greater nor a less number 
of times than ¢ contains = Another method discussed was 
that of approaching incommensurables by the theory of limits, 
as adopted in the French work of E. Rouché and C. de Com- 
berousse, and by many American writers. This method, as also 
Sannia and D’ Ovidio’s definition of proportion, rests on the law 
of continuity which Clifford defines roughly as meaning “ that 
all quantities can be divided into any number of equal parts.’”? 
If in a definition it is desirable to assume as little as possible, 
Euclid’s definition of proportion is preferable, inasmuch as it 
does not postulate this law. To minds capable of grasping 
Euclid’s theory of proportion, that theory excels in beauty 
the treatment of incommensurables with aid of the theory of 
limits. Says Hankel, “We cannot suppress the remark that 
the now prevalent treatment of irrational magnitudes in 
geometry is not well adapted to the subject, in as much as it 
separates in the most unnatural manner things which belong 
together, and forces the continuous—to which, from its very 
nature, the geometric structure. belongs—into the shackles 
of the discrete, which nevertheless it every moment pulls 
asunder.” ? 
About the time of Hankel a new logical difficulty came to 
light. It became evident that the theory of limits as it ex- 
isted in the first half of the nineteenth century must remain 
unsatisfactory unless a theory of irrational numbers could

  288 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
be presupposed. As it was, the lines of procedure involved 
reasoning in a circle. The theory of limits was invoked to 
establish a theory of irrational numbers, whereupon the theory 
of irrational numbers seemed to be used for a more complete 
exposition of the theory of limits. To avoid this vicious cir- 
cle, altogether new theories of irrational numbers were devel- 
oped by Karl Weierstrass, G. Cantor, and R. Dedekind, which 
do not pre-require the theory of limits.1_ These developments 
have greatly strengthened the logical foundations of mathe- 
matics, but have not yet been put in a form suitable for use in 
elementary instruction. From the standpoint of the elementary 
teacher, a logical exposition of irrational numbers and of limits, 
appears impossible. Neither Euclid’s treatment of propor- 
tion, nor the treatment of irrational number and limits as 
given by modern logicians, is proper food for school children. 
The quest for perfect logical rigor is long and disheartening. 
Indeed it is doubtful whether mathematicians have yet reached 
absolute rigor. The creations of G. Cantor and Dedekind have 
only recently given rise to contradictory results, to antinomies, 
that are thoroughly disquieting. To be sure, the introduction 
of certain restrictions in the definitions and the adoption of 
certain “axioms” have removed the antinomies advanced 
thus far. But we know not the day nor the hour when new 
antinomies will spring to light. In view of the subtlety of 
the modern theories of numbers and of doubt as to their real 
logical perfection, there remains no alternative for the ele- 
mentary teacher but to reconcile himself with a logically 
imperfect treatment of the theory of limits and of irrational

numbers.! In fact it is generally felt that these subjects do 
not really belong to elementary mathematics, that a rudimen- 
tary and purely intuitive treatment of limits is all that should 
be attempted in high school and in the first stages of college 
mathematics. 
The same conclusion on matters of logic is reached’ from a 
different angle. Italian mathematicians under the leadership 
of Giuseppe Peano of the University of Turin set themselves 
the problem to adopt definitions, axioms, and undefined terms 
so that geometry might be built up without appealing to intui- 
tion at any point. As is well known, Euclid quietly resorts to 
intuition in many places, for the knowledge of certain facts. 
In the very first proposition of his Elements he states without 
proof that the two circles which he draws intersect each other. 
As contributions to the logical exposition of geometry, the work 
of the Italian school was praiseworthy. A culmination of this 
movement is found in a treatise prepared by the great German 
representative of logical abstract thought in mathematics, 
David Hilbert of the University of Gottingen. At the unveil- 
ing of the Gauss-Weber monument in Gottingen, in June, 1899, 
Hilbert contributed a memorial address on the foundations of 
Geometry, entitled Grundlagen der Geometrie, which was widely 
recognized as a masterpiece of logical exposition. The first 
edition was translated into English in 1902 by E. J. Townsend 
of the University of Illinois. Several German editions, some- 
what enlarged, have appeared since. Hilbert sets up five 
groups of axioms, which include altogether twenty axioms. 
To show how Hilbert’s axioms can serve as a foundation of 
geometry, built up without appeal to intuition, George Bruce 
Halsted published in 1904 his Rational Geometry. This book 
affords perhaps the easiest approach to a knowledge of Hilbert’s

system. At the same time it demonstrates the utter impossi- 
bility of introducing high school students into geometry by 
such a route. To meet certain logical criticisms of his text, 
Halsted prepared a thoroughly revised second edition in 1907, 
which has been translated into French. 
RECENT MOVEMENTS IN TEACHING 
Toward the close of the nineteenth century the influence of 
the Association for the Advancement of Geometric Teaching 
(A. I. G. T.), whose name was changed in 1897 to “ The Mathe- 
matical Association” and whose work had been broadened in 
scope, so as to include elementary mathematical instruction in 
general, showed itself in many ways. To note the progress 
in geometry we need only examine such editions and revisions 
of Euclid as those of Casey, Nixon, Mackay, Langley and 
Phillips, Taylor, and the Elements of Plane Geometry issued by 
the Association.' 
At the beginning of the twentieth century there were two 
great movements in the teaching of elementary mathematics. 
One has been called the “ Perry Movement,” the other is a co- 
operative movement of teachers of different nations under the 
name of the “International Commission on the Teaching of 
Mathematics.” Of these movements the first made at once a 
deep and lasting impress, especially in England and America, 
and then spent itself; the second was planned on a large 
scale and was still in the preliminary stages when interrupted 
by the great war which broke out in 1914.

-P-A-G-E-299
ELEMENTARY GEOMETRY 291 
The Perry Movement 
The reform which this movement introduced is the culmina- 
tion of thirty years of discussion in England, carried on by the 
members of the Mathematical Association. This culmination 
centers around the personality of John Perry, then Professor 
of mechanics and mathematics of the Royal College of Science, 
London. Perry was member of a large and strong committee 
of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, 
appointed in 1901 to report on the “ Teaching of Mathematics.” 
This was not the first time that the British Association had 
interested itself in this matter. A similar committee had re- 
ported on “the possibility of improving the methods of 
instruction in elementary geometry” in 1873 and again in 
1876.1 These early reports considered the advisability of 
adopting an authorized syllabus of geometry; the second 
report considered the merits of the syllabus prepared by the 
A. A. G. T. and recommended it; nevertheless that syllabus 
had not been generally adopted at the beginning of the new 
century. Teaching continued to be guided mainly by the 
requirements of examinations. 
It was at the Glasgow meeting of the British Association in 
1901, when Section A (Mathematics and Physics) and Sec- 
tion L (Education) held a joint meeting, that John Perry 
delivered a great address, which was followed by a brilliant 
discussion, leading to epoch-making results. An account of 
these deliberations was published in 1901 under the title, 
Discussion on the Teaching of Mathematics, edited by John Perry. 
This debate is far more spicy, interesting and valuable than 
the formal report of the committee, made a year later. Perry 
called for a complete divorce from Euclid, for greater emphasis

  292 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
upon experimental geometry, for practical mensuration, for 
the use of squared paper, for more solid geometry, for greater 
emphasis upon the utilitarian parts of geometry. As a result, 
Euclid was dethroned in England from its position of complete 
dominance as a text-book in elementary schools. In closing 
the discussion, Perry said: 
“T take it that we are all agreed upon the following points: 
“1. Experimental methods in mensuration and geometry 
ought to precede demonstrative geometry, but even in the ear- 
liest stages some deductive reasoning ought to be introduced. 
“2. The experimental methods adopted may greatly be left 
to the judgment of the teacher: they may include all those 
mentioned in the Elementary Syllabus which I presented. .. . 
“3. Decimals ought to be used in arithmetic from the begin- 
ning. 
“4, The numerical evaluation of complex mathematical 
expressions may be taken up almost as part of arithmetic or 
at the beginning of the study of algebra, as it is useful in 
familiarizing boys with the meaning of mathematical symbols. 
“5. Logarithms may be used in numerical calculation as 
soon as a boy knows a" x a" = a™*, and long before he is able 
to calculate logarithms. But a boy ought to have a clear 
notion of what is meant by the logarithm of a number. 
“6, In mathematical teaching a thoughtful teacher may be 
encouraged to distinguish what is essential for education in 
the sequence which he employs, from what is merely accord- 
ing to arbitrary fashion, and to endeavor to find out what 
sequence is best, educationally, for the particular kind of boy 
whom he has to teach. 
“7, Examination cannot be done away with in England. 
Great thoughtfulness and experience are necessary qualifica- 
tions for an external examiner. It ought to be understood 
that an examination of a good teacher’s pupils by any other
-P-A-G-E-301
  ELEMENTARY GEOMETRY 293 
examiner than the teacher himself is an imperfect examina- 
tion. ... é 
“ About these that follow I am in more doubt. . . . 3 
“8. A thoughtful teacher ought to know that by the use 
of squared paper and easy algebra, by illustrations from 
dynamics and laboratory experiments, it is possible to give 
to young boys the notions underlying the methods of the 
Infinitesimal calculus. 
“9, A thoughtful teacher may freely use the ideas and 
symbolism of the calculus in teaching elementary mechanics 
to students. 
“10. A thoughtful teacher may allow boys to begin the 
formal study of the calculus before he has taken up advanced 
algebra or advanced trigonometry, or the formal study of 
analytical or geometrical conics, and ought to be encouraged to 
use in this study, not merely geometrical illustrations, but 
illustrations from mechanics and physics, and illustrations 
from any other quantitative study in which a boy may be 
engaged.” 
In the United States the Perry movement did not bring 
about as many changes as in England. ‘There are two prin- 
cipal reasons for this. One reason is that Euclid had been 
discarded long ago as a text for beginners, hence the agitation 
in Great Britain on that point had no bearing on American 
conditions. A second reason is that some of the other recom- 
mendations of Pergy did not directly fit the American situation. 
For example, Perry’s warfare against the system of examina- 
tions then in vogue in British universities and also in the 
English civil service did not affect America, where examina- 
tions were conducted differently and received less stress. 
The clearest American declaration with respect to the Perry 
. movement, in so far as it affected the United States, came 
from E. H. Moore of the University of Chicago in his presi-
-P-A-G-E-302
  294 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
dential address, “On the Foundations of Mathematics,” de- 
livered on December 29, 1902, before the American Mathe- 
matical Society... Moore had in mind mainly college mathe- 
matics, when he said: “In agreement with Perry, it would 
seem possible that the student might be brought into vital 
relation with the fundamental elements of trigonometry, 
analytic geometry, and the calculus, on condition that the 
whole treatment in its origin is and in its development remains 
closely associated with thoroughly concrete phenomena.” 
With reference to secondary schools, Moore puts the question: 
“Would it not be possible to organize the algebra, geometry, 
and physics of the secondary school into a thoroughly coherent 
four years’ course, comparable in strength and closeness of 
structure with the four years’ course in Latin?” As to 
method of instruction: “This program of reform calls for the 
development of a thoroughgoing laboratory system of instruc- 
tion in mathematics and physics, a principal purpose being as 
far as possible to develop on the part of every student the 
true spirit of research, and an appreciation, practical as well 
as theoretic, of the fundamental methods of science.” 
Experience seems to show that the success of the laboratory 
method of mathematical instruction rests upon several contin- 
gencies, such as, (1) rearrangement of the schedule so as to 
allow more time in school for the courses in mathematics, 
(2) the equipment of suitable laboratories, (3) the enlistment 
of teachers who are competent to give laboratory courses, and 
soon. Even if all these conditions prevail, there is no a priori 
reason why the laboratory method should excel other methods. 
The superiority of any method over its competitors must be 
determined by actual trial. Such superiority has not yet been 
established experimentally for the laboratory method.

We pass to the broader question, the unification of the dif- 
ferent branches of high school mathematics, carried on in a 
manner that will meet more effectively the practical demands 
of the age. This question has been under discussion and ex- 
perimentation ever since the opening of the new century. The 
impression seems to prevail that, in past decades and past cen- 
turies, mathematics never were unified, that teachers placed 
mathematical topics into separate and air-tight compartments. 
Nothing can be further from the truth. Previous to the nine- 
teenth century there existed a fair degree of fusion of different 
branches of mathematics. We see this, for instance, in the 
Ahmes papyrus, in Euclid’s Elements, with its three books on 
arithmetic, in the works of Vieta, Stevin, Oughtred, Newton, 
Leibniz, and Euler. 
The geometric phraseology “linear” equation, “quadratic” 
equation, “cubic” equation, “ a square” for a®, “a cube” for 
a’, shows that, in its formative period, algebra was not disso- 
ciated from geometry. Moreover, the solution of cubic and 
quartic equations by the method of geometric construction ap- 
pears earlier in the history of mathematics than do the purely 
algebraic solutions. Isolation in mathematics as a science is a 
product of the nineteenth century. Steiner and Von Staudt 
isolated modern geometry from analysis. On the other hand, 
Weierstrass, Kronecker, Klein, and others worked in the direc- 
tion of arithmetization which makes number the sole founda- 
tion of mathematics. This isolation is due to the efforts 
toward increased rigor of presentation, in course of which the 
foundations of mathematics were examined anew. Not only 
in the growth of mathematics as a science, but also in the 
teaching of mathematics, isolation of topics set in. Frequently, 
books which in their first editions exhibited a certain degree of 
fusion of topics, passed to greater isolation in later editions.

first for a moderate unification of geometry with arithmetic 
and trigonometry. As late as 1845 this text still contained 
trigonometry, but later the trigonometry and the practical 
applications of geometry were gradually filtered out. Nicholas 
Pike’s New and Complete System of Arithmetic, printed at New- 
buryport, Mass., in 1788, and used for a time even in our 
American colleges, contained in addition to the ordinary arith- 
metical topics, a treatment of logarithms, trigonometry, alge- 
bra, and conic sections. The fourth edition of Pike’s book 
omitted the topics not strictly arithmetical, and constituted 
Pike’s Abridged Arithmetic. Thus there arose in teaching an 
isolation of topics, a moderate degree of which was beneficial. 
Teachers found it easier to reach good results in the classroom 
by taking one topic at a time. But isolation came to be car- 
ried to an extreme. The exercises of the schoolroom related 
to isolated topics. The problems of practical life called for 
ability to combine arithmetic, algebra, and geometry. The 
pupils lacked experience and skill in combination. Hence the 
need for reunification. No agreement has yet been reached as 
to the kind and degree of unification that is most suitable 
under modern conditions of industry and life. There is dan- 
ger of excessive unification. Too much fusion may produce 
confusion. In intense fusion there is danger of introducing 
simultaneously a large number of new ideas, new definitions. 
The pupil does not concentrate upon a few ideas, but scatters 
his efforts over a large number of them and obtains only a 
superficial view of any one. 
If it be asked what degree of unification can be safely adopted 
as having stood the test of experience, the answer would seem 
to be as follows: At any stage of mathematical study, let the 
pupil use all the mathematics that he has had up to that time. 
For instance, when he studies algebra, let him use freely the 
arithmetic that preceded, as well as the intuitive geometry
-P-A-G-E-305
ELEMENTARY GEOMETRY 297 
previously learned ; when pursuing solid geometry, let him use 
the arithmetic, algebra, and plane geometry previously studied. 
To this extent, unification is sanctioned by experience. How 
much farther we can go advantageously under modern condi- 
tions remains to be determined by experience. Doubtless 
some allowance must be made for individual predilections of 
teachers and the practical needs of different pupils. 
The International Commission 
At the Fourth International Congress of mathematicians 
that was held at Rome in 1908, David Eugene Smith of Teach- 
ers College, Columbia University, made a motion calling for 
the appointment of an International Commission on the Teach- 
ing of Mathematics. The motion was carried and a Central 
Committee was appointed, consisting of Felix Klein of the 
University of Gottingen, Sir George Greenhill of London, and 
Henri Fehr of the University of Geneva in Switzerland. In 
1912 David Eugene Smith was added to the committee. The 
Commission adopted as its official organ L’ Enseignement mathé- 
matique, Revue internationale paraissant tous les deux mois. This 
bi-monthly journal had been started at Paris in 1899; it ap- 
pears under the editorship of C. A. Laisant and H. Fehr. Thus 
far the Commission has chiefly occupied itself in effecting 
organizations in the different countries, and in collecting and 
publishing, for comparative examination, the fullest possible 
information as to the present status of the teaching of mathe- 
matics in each of the countries represented. The first report 
of the International Commission was made at the Fifth Inter- 
national Congress of Mathematicians,! held at Cambridge, Eng- 
land, in 1912. At that time there were 27 countries repre- 
sented, and 150 printed reports were made, leaving about 50

still to be published. These reports contain detailed informa- 
tion on the condition ‘of mathematical teaching at different 
schools and in different countries. They are important contri- 
, butions to the history of education. Most exhaustive are the 
numerous reports prepared by the Germans. The British re- 
ports are models of concise presentation. The documents pre- 
pared in the United States by special committees acting under 
the direction of the American Commissioners (D. E. Smith of 
Teachers College, W. F. Osgood of Harvard University, J. W. 
A. Young of the University of Chicago) have been published 
by the United States Bureau of Education. The breaking out 
of the Great War, in 1914, interrupted the work of the Inter- 
national Commission. 
While the publications! hitherto issued are mainly historical, 
and descriptive of present conditions, it is evident that the 
representatives of the international movement stand for the 
more thorough embodiment, in mathematical teaching, of cer- 
tain ideas, at least a part of which were emphasized in the 
Perry movement. Predominant are the ideas of graphic repre- 
sentation, functionality, conservative unification of mathe- 
matics, alignment with the practical demands of the age. In 
Germany these ideas were strongly advocated by F. Klein at a 
school conference held in 1900. In France these same ideas 
found expression in the text-books published by E. Borel in 
1903, which were translated into German by P. Stickel in

1908, to serve as illustrations of what can be done in the way 
of actual realization of the new plans. 
The subject of graphic representation of mathematical ex- 
pressions involving variables goes back to the time of Newton 
and Descartes ; the graphic representation of curves defined by 
certain properties goes back to the time of the Greeks. 
In the nineteenth century graphic methods came to be used 
widely in mechanical science,’ not only abroad but also in the 
United States. In 1898 R. H. Thurston of Cornell University 
read before the American Society of Mechanical Engineers a 
paper on “Graphic Diagrams and Glyptic Models.” In the 
teaching of elementary mathematics graphic methods were 
introduced slowly. Lone voices advocating the use of graphs 
in teaching were heard in the nineteenth century. 
In 1842 Strehlke of Danzig expressed himself as follows: 
“The graphic representation of functions appears to me an 
effective aid in instruction, for the purpose of conveying a 
clear conception of their properties. With this end in view 
I have drawn a considerable number of such graphs—the 
curves of sines, cosines, tangents, of natural and Briggian 
logarithms. ... Even simple functions like y=a, y= 2, 
y=2, y=, if they are drawn for the same variable and 
upon the same sheet, present properties which the pupil would 
not see the moment the function is put before him.” In the 
solution of equations, graphic methods received recognition in 
L. Saint-Loup’s Traité de la résolution des équations numériques, 
Paris, 1861, a text written for students in the Polytechnic 
School and the Normal School in Paris, “a l’usage des candi- 
tats aux écoles polytechnique et normale.” The students were

more advanced than are American students of high school 
grade. In the Tutorial Trigonometry, by William Briggs and 
G. H. Bryan, London, 1897, attention is given to the tracing 
of the curves of the trigonometric functions. 
In 1896 appeared Arthur H. Barker’s Graphical Calculus, 
London, which represented a series of lectures given to en- 
gineering students. It marks a complete contrast to the 
ordinary mathematical book of the school of Todhunter. It 
is a work intended for students ready to enter upon the study 
of the calculus. 
In the United States the earliest use of graphic methods in 
elementary teaching consisted in the representation, by curves, 
of empirical data, such as temperatures, cloudiness of the sky. 
From 1885 to 1889 such methods were taught in the school of 
the Chautauqua Town and Country Club, to about two thou- 
sand pupils. But these graphic methods met with no general 
adoption at that time. In 1898 Francis E. Nipher of Wash- 
ington University in St. Louis brought out an Introduction to 
Graphic Algebra. The first regular text-book using graphs was 
the Algebra for Schools (1899) by George W. Evans of Boston. 
In 1902 there appeared as a supplement to Webster Wells’ 
Essentials of Algebra and New Higher Algebra, a monograph 
of twenty-one pages on Graphs, prepared by Robert J. Aley, 
then of the University of Indiana. Henry B. Newson of 
the University of Kansas followed in 1905 with a Graphic 
Algebra for Secondary Schools. In Vol. 5 (1905) of School 
Science of Mathematics there is an article on graphs by 
F. C. Touton of Kansas City. Since 1905 our algebras for 
secondary schools introduce the graph as a regular subject for 
instruction. As early as 1903 “ the use of the graphic methods

and illustrations, particularly with the solution of equations, 
is also expected” as an entrance requirement in mathematics 
to eastern colleges. 
American Associations 
There have been organized in the United States a number 
of associations for the advancement of the teaching of mathe- 
matics and science in secondary schools. Thus we have the 
Association of Teachers of Mathematics in New England, the 
Association of Ohio Teachers of Mathematics and Science, the 
Association of Teachers of Mathematics in the Middle States 
and Maryland, Central Association of Science and Mathematics 
Teachers, Colorado Mathematics Association, Kansas Associa- 
tion of Mathematics, Missouri Society of Teachers of Mathe- 
matics and Science, Iowa Association of Mathematics Teachers, 
North Dakota Association of Science and Mathematics 
Teachers, Southern California Science and Mathematics Asso- 
ciation, Oregon State Science and Mathematical Teachers 
Association. 
The Mathematical Association of America, organized in 
December, 1914, devotes itself mainly to the teaching of Math- 
ematics in College. The American Mathematical Society (or- 
ganized in 1888 as the New York Mathematical Society, and 
reorganized under its present name in 1894) devotes itself 
entirely to the furtherance of original research. 
The National Educational Association (organized in Phila- 
delphia in 1857 under the name of “ National Teachers’ Asso- 
ciation” and re-named in 1870) has always interested itself in 
the teaching of elementary mathematics. In 1893 a “Com- 
mittee of Ten” reported on secondary school studies, including 
the recommendations of various sub-committees or “confer 
ences.” A “conference of ten” on mathematics met at Har- 
vard in December, 1892. Simon Newcomb acted as chairman.
-P-A-G-E-310
  302 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
A report was prepared, which is given in outline in the Report 
of the Commissioner of Education, 1892-1893, Vol. 2, p. 1426. 
Full reports of the “conferences” were published separately 
in 1894. It was recommended by the mathematics conference 
that the course in arithmetic be abridged by omitting subjects 
which perplex and exhaust the pupil without affording mental 
discipline, and enriched by exercises in concrete problems, that 
geometry be first taught in concrete form, including measure- 
ments, and that greater care be taken to avoid slovenliness of 
expression in demonstrations. Stress was laid upon the inter- 
lacing of arithmetic, algebra, and geometry. The eagerness 
with which the various reports were received caused a “ Com- 
mittee of Fifteen” to be appointed by the National Educa- 
tion Association to institute similar inquiries for schools 
below the high school. Recommendations were made on the 
teaching of arithmetic.! It was argued that the simplest frac- 
tions, $, 4, 4, could be taught very early, that compound in- 
terest, foreign exchange, and certain other topics be dropped, 
that mental arithmetic be emphasized, that there be a re- 
arrangement of subjects, and that the rudiments of algebra be 
introduced in the seventh year. 
In 1899 the Committee on College Entrance Requirements, 
appointed by the N. E. A., made recommendations in mathe- 
matics which were in practical agreement with those of the 
Committee of Ten. In 1904 the Association of Mathematics 
Teachers in New England appointed a committee, with George 
W. Evans of Boston as chairman, to consider the advisability 
of preparing a geometry syllabus, or adopting some syllabus 
already drawn up. Such a syllabus was drawn up; though 
carefully prepared, it did not become generally known. A 
report by a syllabus committee of the Central Association of 
Science and Mathematics Teachers, made in 1906, attracted 
1 Report of the U. S. Commissioner of Education for 1893-1894, p. 582.
-P-A-G-E-311
ELEMENTARY GEOMETRY 303 
wider attention, but was imperfect in some respects. Finally, 
in 1908 and 1909 a committee was organized under the joint 
auspices of the National Education Association and the 
American Federation of Teachers of the Mathematical and 
National Sciences. H. E. Slaught of the University of Chi- 
cago acted as chairman. The final report of this committee 
was printed in 1912, and received much attention both in the 
United States and abroad. Theorems are classified into four 
groups, according to their importance, the groups being dis- 
tinguished one from the other by the kind of type used. The 
report gives considerable attention also to logical considera- 
tions, and contains an introduction on the history of the teach- 
ing of geometry during the last two centuries. 
In recent time there has been considerable unrest in the 
United States on matters relating to mathematics in second- 
ary schools. Proceeding on the theory that the real aim is 
not, as formerly held, to “train the mind,” but to teach only 
“things that are practical,” so that the mathematical instruc- 
tion can be “ hitched up to life,” some educators exert pressure 
to omit certain subjects formerly thought essential, such as 
the treatment of factoring and fractions in algebra, and to 
restrict problems in algebra and exercises in geometry to those 
that are practical. In some ways the modern tendency re- 
sembles the movement of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, 
led by the “ Commercial School of Arithmeticians.” As in the 
sixteenth century, so now, there is meant by “ practical,” not 
that which is ultimately practical, but that which is immediately 
practical. By this test a course resembling ancient Egyptian 
geometry makes a stronger appeal than one resembling the 
more scientific Greek geometry. There are other modern 
educators who go farther and, denying the disciplinary value 
of mathematics, insist that high school mathematics, or at least 
a part of it, should be removed from the required list of high  
-P-A-G-E-312
204 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
school studies. It may be of interest, in this place, to call 
attention to earlier attacks on the value of mathematics as an 
exercise in the training of the mind. 
Attacks upon the Study of Mathematics as a Training of 
the Mind.t 
Probably the most famous attack that has ever been made 
upon the educational value of mathematics was published by 
the philosopher, Sir William Hamilton, in the Edinburgh Re- 
view of 1836. He claims that mathematics is “not an im- 
proving study”; “If we consult reason, experience and the 
common testimony of ancient and modern times, none of our 
intellectual studies tend to cultivate a smaller number of the 
faculties, in a more partial manner, than mathematics.” He 
proceeds to adduce testimony to the effect that “the cultiva- 
tion afforded by the mathematics is, in the highest degree, 
one-sided and contracted,” that mathematics “freeze and parch 
the mind,” that this science is “absolutely pernicious as a 
mean of internal culture.” Hamilton’s argument proceeds 
along two principal lines; the first is to prove that those who 
confine their studies to mathematics alone are addicted to blind 
credulity or irrational scepticism and, in general, lack good 
judgment in affairs of life. We admit at once, that this last 
contention is probably valid; the exclusive study of any branch 
of knowledge is to be discouraged as undesirable for a liberal 
education. Hamilton’s second mode of attack consists in try- 
ing to show that many mathematicians found mathematics 
unsatisfactory as an exercise of the mind, and renounced it. 
The only mathematicians of sufficient prominence to be known

mathematics as a training of the mind,”’ in the Popular Science Monthly, 
1912, pp. 360-372. See also Dr. C. J. Keyser, Mathematics, Columbia 
Univ. Press, 1907, pp. 20-44.

  ELEMENTARY GEOMETRY 305 
to the modern reader are D’Alembert, Pascal, Descartes, and 
Dugald Stewart. Many other men, from all ages and nations, 
are quoted, and constitute indeed a “cloud of witnesses.” Says 
Alfred Pringsheim of Munich: “Iam ashamed to confess that 
before reading Hamilton’s article I did not know a single one 
of these great authorities even by name; an extenuating cir- 
cumstance is the fact that some of these names I could not 
find even in the scientific directories.” The most extensive 
examination of Hamilton’s quotations and most thorough dis- 
proof of his contentions are found in an article by A. T. Bledsoe 
in the Southern Review for July, 1877. Bledsoe was at one 
time professor of mathematics at the University of Virginia. 
He proves what some other writers before him hinted at, or 
proved only in part, namely, that Hamilton was extremely 
careless in the selection of his quotations. By making partial 
extracts, badly chosen, he made scientists say exactly the op- 
posite of their real sentiments. Most strikingly is this true 
of his treatment of Descartes. 
The second great attack upon mathematical study was made 
by Schopenhauer, the pessimistic sage of Frankfort-on-the- 
Main. In his The World as Will and Idea, second edition, 
1844, he makes war on Euclid and his. geometrical demonstra- 
tions. “We are compelled by the principle of contradiction 
to admit that what Euclid demonstrates is true, but we do not 
comprehend why it is so. We have, therefore, almost the 
same uncomfortable feeling that we experience after a juggling 
trick, and, in fact, most of Euclid’s demonstrations are re- 
markably like such feats. The truth almost always enters by 
the back door, for it manifests itself par accidens through some 
contingent circumstance. Often a reductio ad absurdum shuts 
all the doors one after another, until only one is left, which

we are therefore compelled to enter.” This is part of Schopen- 
hauer’s famous characterization of mathematical reasoning as 
“mousetrap proofs” (Mausefallenbeweise). His objections 
are directed almost entirely against Euclid. He had no 
acquaintance with modern mathematics. His criticism of 
Euclid as a text for children is largely valid. Euclid did not 
write for children. It is a historical puzzle, difficult to ex- 
plain, how Euclid ever came to be regarded as a text suitable 
for the first introduction into geometry. As to the reductio ad 
absurdum method of proof. De Morgan said: “The most 
serious embarrassment in the purely reasoning part is the 
reductio ad absurdum, or indirect demonstration. This form 
of argument is generally the last to be clearly understood, 
though it occurs almost on the threshold of the elements.” 
Schopenhauer’s attack bears only indirectly upon the question 
relating to the mind-training value of mathematics. His views 
must have attracted considerable attention in Germany, for as 
late as 1894 A. Pringsheim thought it necessary to refute his 
argument, and only nine years ago Felix Klein referred to 
him at some length in a mathematical lecture at the University 
of Gottingen. 5 
A third attack upon mathematics was made in 1869 by the 
naturalist, Thomas H. Huxley. In the Fortnightly Review, 
1869, p. 433, he said: Mathematics is that study “which 
knows nothing of observation, nothing of experiment, nothing 
of induction, nothing of causation.” In an after-dinner speech, 
reported in Macmillan’s Magazine, 1869, pp. 177-184, he argued 
against language and mathematical training, and in favor of 
scientific training. “Mathematical training,” he said, “is 
almost purely deductive. The mathematician starts with a 
few propositions, the proof of which is so obvious that they 
are called self-evident, and the rest of his work consists of 
subtle deductions from them.” Of great interest is the reply 
 
-P-A-G-E-315
    ELEMENTARY GEOMETRY 307 
made to Huxley by the mathematician, J. J. Sylvester! To 
Americans Sylvester’s name is memorable, because in 1876 
Sylvester came over from England and for eight years taught 
modern higher algebra to American students at the Johns 
Hopkins University and gave a powerful stimulus to the study 
of higher mathematics in this country. Sylvester was an 
enthusiast. His reply to Huxley was his presidential address 
before Section A of the British Association in 1869. By his 
own experiences as a mathematician he tried to show that 
Huxley was wrong. Sylvester insists “that mathematical 
analysis is constantly invoking the aid of new principles, new 
ideas and new methods . . . springing direct from the inher- 
ent powers and activity of the human mind... that it is 
unceasingly calling forth the faculties of observation and com- 
parison, that one of its principal weapons is induction, that it 
has frequent recourse to experimental trial and verification, 
and that it affords a boundless scope for the exercise of the 
highest efforts of imagination and invention. Lagrange . . . 
expressed emphatically his belief in the importance to the 
mathematician of the faculty of observation; Gauss called 
mathematics the science of the eye . . . I could tell a story of 
almost romantic interest about my own latest researches in a 
field where geometry, algebra, and the theory of numbers melt 
in a surprising manner into one another, . . . which would 
very strikingly illustrate how much observation, divination, 
induction, experimental trial, and verification, causation too, 
. .. have to do with the work of the mathematician.” Syl- 
vester proved conclusively that the mathematician engaged in 
original research does exercise powers of internal observation, 
induction, experimentation, and even causation. The vital 
question arises, are these powers exercised by the pupil in the 
classroom? That depends. If a text-book in geometry is 
. 1 See page 283, last footnote.

  308 A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS 
memorized, as used to be the case in some schools, then doubt- 
less Huxley was right. But when attention is paid to original 
problems, to the use of measuring instruments, to modes of 
proving theorems different from those in the book, then the 
pupil exercises the same faculties as does the advanced mathe- 
matician engaged in research. 
Perhaps the latest prominent attacks on mathematics are by 
David Snedden, Commissioner of Education in Massachusetts, 
in an address delivered in 1915 before the National Educa- 
tion Association, and by Abraham Flexner in an article, 
called “A Modern School.”! Placing great faith in the 
methods of experimental pedagogy that are advocated in 
schools of education of our universities at the present time, 
these writers are attacking the mind-training value of mathe- 
matics and are insisting that, in view of the results obtained 
from experiments, the burden of proof to show that algebra 
and geometry should remain in the high school curriculum 
rests upon those who advocate its continuance and not upon 
_ those who would eliminate them. Says Flexner: “Modern 
education will include nothing simply because tradition recom- 
mends it, . . . it includes nothing for which an affirmative 
cannot now be made out. As has already been intimated, 
this method of approach would probably result in greatly re- 
ducing the time allowed to mathematics, and decidedly chang- 
ing the form of what is still retained. If, for example, only 
so much arithmetic is taught as people actually have occasion 
to use, the subject will sink to modest proportions... . The 
same policy may be employed in dealing with algebra and 
geometry. What is taught, when it is taught, and how it is 
taught will in that event depend altogether on what is needed,

when it is needed, and the form in which it is needed.” It 
will be instructive to watch the outcome of this discussion. 
Certain it is that the teaching of mathematics will require 
constant modifications in order to keep pace with the ever- 
changing needs of modern life.

  A History of Mathematics 
By FLORIAN CAJORI, Px.D. 
Dean of the Department of Engineering and Head Professor of Mathematics in 
Colorado College 
422 pages, 8v0, $3.50 
“The author-presents in this volume a very interesting review of the 
development of mathematics. The work throughout has been written 
with care and evident understanding, and will doubtless be of interest 
and value to students of mathematics. Professor Cajori treats his sub- 
ject, not only with a certain enthusiasm, but with a masterful hand.” 
— Philadelphia Evening Bulletin. 
' “We have nothing but commendation to bestow.” — Scientific Ameri- 
can. 
“The best we can say of the work is that it is more interesting than 
any novel.” — Queen’s Quarterly. 
“ After having read this admirable work, I take great pleasure in 
recommending it to all students and teachers of mathematics. The 
development and progress of mathematics have been traced by a master 
pen. Every mathématician should procure a copy of this book. The 
book is written in a clear and pleasing style.” — Dr. Ha.steap, in 
American Mathematical Monthly. 
“A scholarship both wide and deep is manifest.” —/Journal of Edu- 
cation. 
“ A clear, concise, and critical account. Its style is so clear, concise,

  An Introduction to the 
Modern Theory of Equations 
By FLORIAN CAJORI, Pu.D. 
Dean of the Department of Engineering and Head Professor of Mathematics in 
Colorado College 
239 pages, 8vo, $1.75 
“The main difference between this text and others on the same sub- 
ject, published in the English language, consists in the selection of the 
material. In proceeding from the elementary to the more advanced 
properties of equations, the subject of invariants and covariants is here 
omitted, to make room for a discussion of the elements of substitutions 
and substitution-groups, of domains of rationality, and of their applica- 
tion to equations. Thereby the reader acquires some familiarity with 
the fundamental results on the theory of equations, reached by Gauss, 
Abel, Galois, and Kronecker.” —/ournal of Education. 
“This book demands mention as the only small treatise in the lan- 
guage embracing the whole subject and showing how best to treat higher 
algebraic equations. The account of the Galois theory is avowedly 
taken from Weber's algebra, but is for the first time brought within the 
comprehension of every student of middling capacity, by numerous 
examples.” — The Nation. 
“Dr. Cajori is known as a man who writes clearly and interestingly on 
subjects of difficult nature. His present work is no exception to this 
tuie; the arrangement is new, and while the subject matter is of course 
old, his handling of it is quite different from the usual.” — Scientific 
American.

  A History of Physics in its Elementary Branches 
including the Evolution of Physical Laboratories 
By FLORIAN CAJORI, Pux.D. 
Dean of the Department of Engineering and Head Professor of Mathematics in « 
Colorado College 
8v0, 322 pages, $1.60 
“Dr. Cajori has produced a book that was needed, and as a handy 
manual of reference for the main historical facts of physics it will dis- 
charge a distinct service in our academic and high school libraries as 
well as in the hands of individual students who have not access to for- 
eign literature.” — Zhe Monist. 
“The author writes in such an easy, entertaining manner, that the 
book, which might easily be made dry and over technical, is entirely 
readable and enjoyable to the non-specialist. Every teacher and stu- 
dent of physics should read it and add it to his library. It shows care- 
ful study, enthusiasm, and a comprehensive grasp of the subject.” — 
Journal of Education. 
“The references to authorities are very numerous throughout the 
book, and form a valuable feature, furnishing proofs of statements as 
well as means of pursuing the topics in greater detail. The author 
shows a wide knowledge of the sources of history, not merely of the 
standard works, but the isolated essays and notes scattered throughout 
periodicals. . . . We know of no book in the English language that 
covers the ground so well as the one before us.” — Chemical News.

  Historical. Introduction to 
Mathematical Literature 
By G. A. MILLER 
Professor of Mathematics in the University of Illinois 
302 pages, 12mo, $1.60 
This book grew out of a series of lectures which were intended to 
supplement the work of the regular mathematical courses along general 
historical lines. It aims to give a brief account of the most important 
modern mathematical activities, such as the mathematical societies, 
mathematical congresses, and petiodical publications and reviews, and 
to exhibit fundamental results in elementary mathematics in the light 
of their historical development. In preparing it for publication, the 
author aimed to meet the need of a text-book for synoptic and inspira- 
tional courses which can be followed successfully by those who have 
not had extensive mathematical training. As the book is written in a 
popular style and deals with many present-day mathematical questions, 
such as errors in the current mathematical literature, standing problems, 
and living mathematicians, it is believed that it will also be found suit- 
able for mathematics teachers’ reading clubs. Most of the book is 
about mathematics and mathematicians, rather than on mathematics, 
and is devoted to a brief discussion of some of the principal aids to the 
student who is just beginning to do independent mathematical work. 
It includes a brief consideration of the greater Fermat Theorem, for 
the proof of which a large prize is now outstanding.

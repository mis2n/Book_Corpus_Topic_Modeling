EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
Experience and progress 
TuE proper means for reconstructing our social 
institutions are best suggested by a careful ac- 
cumulation and analysis of our institutional ex- 
periences. In every work of political and social 
reform, we are more or less conscious of the past 
failures and successes of our instruments. But 
such consciousness is not altogether deliberate 
and thorough. ‘With communities, as with indi- 
viduals, much is forgotten or neglected; while 
other fragments of our past, emphasized beyond 
their true importance, influence us unduly. Thus 
many of our social advances are gained through 
a radicalism that has finally to be tempered by 
*the work of the reactionary. Such progress, the 
product of conflict and partisanship, is costly. 
It arises out of an imperfect mode of bringing 
our experiences to bear upon our problems. In# 
the reconstruction of states, schools, vocations, 
and other social instruments, we need a wider ac-

cumulation and a saner interpretation of the 
facts of our educational history. 
Experience and school reform 
The institution of education does not escape 
the full force of the principle suggested. Indeed, 
educational conditions are such in America to- 
day that one might be disposed to say that this 
principle has a special and peculiar applicability 
to the problem of school reform ; at least, there is 
no institution where a rational use of institutional 
experience could effect more good. 
A static view of education 
We have among us those who have become 
keenly sensitive to the evils of the many changes 
in the methods of our schools. They have per- 
haps been over-sensitive to the very necessity of 
rightful change. Seeing that our schools have 
been alternately pulled and hauled by radical and 
reactionary, and failing to perceive the slow but 
certain progress that has taken place, they have 
wearied of change in educational theory and 
practice. Impatient of the hasty wrangling and 
contention, these sigh for a peaceful and fixed

programmein education. As temperament or rear- 
ing dictates, they offer one of two modes for its 
achievement: (1) the return to the educational 
system of some past century, or (2) the solution 
of the entire matter once and for all by some coun- 
cil of wise and agreeable experts. Nothing save 
educational history alone can well reveal the natve 
futility of such notions of what is best in education. 
An unstable view of education 
There are those, too, among us whose error is 
quite the reverse of these we have just mentioned. 
They are impressed by the panorama of the de- 
cades, by the changing nature of man’s economic 
and spiritual surroundings. They perceive life as 
ever new, calling for some modern virtue or skill 
in man, and for a new training which will pro- 
vide it. Each change in life must be met, and 
the school must be quick to provide the power. 
The new necessities dominate ; the old and the 
eternal are forgotten. So the school, disregarding 
the value of stability, must flit from one purpose 
to another. It is civic training to-day, moral train- 
ing to-morrow, and industrial training the day

after. For these, too, educational experience has 
its message, the lesson of poise and perma- 
nence, — its revelation of the abiding powers in 
men and the continuing necessities in all ages. 
_ A preliminary historical interpretation 
It would be impossible to offer in a small vol- 
ume any complete answer to the tendencies of 
unrest in our educational thought. But it is pos- 
sible to present a preliminary interpretation of 
American educational history which will suggest 
the fundamental nature of many of our present 
problems. Even the cursory reader of the essay 
here presented must perceive that ours cannot 
be a static system of education. Change is the 
inevitable accompaniment of schools which are 
the defense and the support of a progressive demo- 
cratic society. But change need not be whimsi- 
cal and irrational, the fruit of mere radicalism or 
mere reaction. A deliberate and thorough con- 
sciousness of our educational past with all its les- 
sons for the present and future will reveal the 
stable relations that exist between the school or- 
ganization and social conditions.

  EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
In these days when some of our educational 
workers are doubting the power of educational 
history to give practical guidance to the teacher, 
it is a particular pleasure to offer this illuminating 
historical treatment of the problem of educa-

CHANGES IN THE NATURE OF 
OUR LIFE 
Tue first half-century of our national life was) 
a period of intense struggle. It was essentially a 
pioneer period. Conditions everywhere were ru- 
ral and agricultural. Means of communication 
were few and difficult. There were many diffi- 
culties to be met and overcome, many dangers to 
be encountered, many privations to be borne, 
and the pressing demand for food and shelter for 
family and stock was one that needed to be sat- 
isfied before all else. On all sides the life of 
the people was one of unremitting toil. There 
were forests to be cut, land to be cleared, 
swamps to be drained, and the wilderness to be: 
tamed and reduced to civilization. The physical 
conquest of nature, carried on by the primitive 
methods of the time, largely absorbed the ener- 
gies and the earnings of the people. We of to- 
I

day who can call to our aid the labor-saving de- 
vices, the inventions, the discoveries, and the 
accumulated knowledge of a century, can scarcely 
realize the difficulties which confronted a pioneer 
people a century ago, or the primitive conditions 
of their pioneer life. 
Experience everywhere was the great teacher. 
What was demanded on all sides was the man 
who could meet the exacting conditions of his 
rude environment and make a living for himself 
and family. To be able to do was the real test, 
and both boy and girl were trained to accom- 
plishment. In the dozens of different kinds of 
work on the farm or in the village home, the boy 
learned much that to-day he has little chance of 
learning. He learned to make and repair wagons 
and harness; to build and repair buildings; to 
take care of animals ; to sow and to reap; to read 
the signs of the weather; to know the trees, the 
plants and the animals about his home and their 
habits; and to know how to act when emergen- 
cies arose which called for action. He was edu- 
cated in the school of experience, and it devel- 
oped in particular his judgment and his skill in 
2

doing things with his fingers. The girl, too, re- 
ceived an analogous training in the daily duties 
about the home. 
In this early period, almost everything used 
was made by hand. The factory system had not 
as yet destroyed domestic industry, and every- 
where the home was a workshop as well as a 
dwelling. Most of the common articles now sold 
in the stores — clothing, shoes, preserved foods, 
smoked meats, lard, soap, candles, butter, furni- 
ture— were made in the homes. On the farm 
almost all the common industries of life were 
practised. Town life did not differ materially 
from that in the country. Life in the days of our 
forefathers was indeed intense, and every one 
found plenty to do as soon as able to work. The 
different industrial processes, which to children 
to-day are closed books, not only stood revealed 
to every youngster, but also called for the initia- 
tion of the youngster into the work of manufac- 
ture as soon as he was able to put his hand to 
the task. The conditions of life were largely 
static. The apprentice system was everywhere 
in vogue, and experience was the chief means of 
3

  CHANGING CONCEPTIONS 
education. The provision of food, clothing, and 
the necessities of existence for the family, with 
all the steps in the industrial processes which 
these involved, made heavy demands on the time 
and the energy of all. 
Since this earlier time steam, electricity, and 
machinery have wrought a tremendous change 
in our national life. Old occupations and meth- 
ods are gone. One man with a machine to-day 
can do the work formerly done by fifty or a hun- 
dred men. The people of Massachusetts have a 
greater productive capacity now than had the 
entire English-speaking gace a century ago. So 
great have been the changes wrought that agri- 
culture, commerce, and manufacturing have been 
more profoundly modified during the past hun- 
dred years than they had been before since the 
days of the Crusades. Manners, customs, re- 
ligious observances, political ideas, and views of 
life, as well as the ways of living, have been al- 
most equally transformed. Business knowledge, 
industrial skill, executive capacity and personal 
efficiency have been emphasized ; peace and in- 
dustrial welfare have been substituted in large 
4

part for the wastefulness of war; and leisure, 
culture, and education have come to be regarded 
as the birthrights of all. The human race as a 
whole has been relieved from the constant and 
pressing struggle for the necessities of exist- 
ence, and lifted to a higher plane of material 
comfort and industrial welfare. An increasing 
proportion of our population have been freed 
from the mere drudgery of life and have been per- 
mitted to devote themselves to the work of ex- 
tending culture and advancing the art and the 
science for the race. 
A people with littlé material wealth at the 
beginning, the War of the Revolution left us im- 
poverished. It was not until the third decade of 
our national existence that evidences of prosper- 
ity began to be manifest.(Up to 1807, the devel- 
opment of our country was almost wholly agri- 
cultural. This meant a scattered and an isolated 
population, with few common ideas, common 
interests, or common ses Vea all of the 
manufactured articles in use’were made in Great 
Britain. The Embargo of 1807 gave rise to “in- 
fant industries,’ and many of the legislative acts

of the next five years had to do with the grant- 
ing of charters and privileges to various kinds of 
manufactories. The War of 1812, the shipping 
regulations of foreign nations adopted at the 
close of this and the Napoleonic Wars, and the 
general westward movement of population all 
tended to build up manufacturing faster than 
agriculture. 
The period from 1810 to 1850 was a period of 
great national expansion and great industrial de- 
velopment. The introduction of the steamboat 
and the railroad, together with the digging of 
many canals, opened up the possibility of doing 
business on a scale before unthought of, and led 
to a great demand for labor-saving machinery of 
every sort. The inventive genius of our peo- 
ple was called into play, and Yankee ingenuity 
manifested itself in every direction. After 
1825, the threshing machine began to supplant 
the flail and the roller; after 1826, edge tools be- 
gan to be made in this country; and shortly 
after this time the Fairbanks platform scale, the 
reaper, and the lock-stitch sewing machine were 
invented.

Since that time, the whole aspect of our life 
has been changed. The railroad has made com- 
munication easy and cheap. It is five hours from 
Boston to New York now, instead of five days. 
The telegraph and the submarine cable have an- 
nihilated time and space. It no longer takes four 
weeks to get news from England, or three months 
from Manila or Hong Kong. The telephone has 
‘made us all neighbors, and enables a single person 
to-day to transact the business formerly done by 
ten ortwelve. The many labor-saving devices en- 
able us greatly to increase our capacity for dis- 
patching work and have largely increased our 
effectiveness, while they have at the same time 
freed us and our children from the necessity of 
doing much of the laborious work which people ~ 
in earlier times were compelled todo. Theneces- 
sities of life have been cheapened and made - 
common, and even many of the luxuries of life 
have been brought within the reach of almost all. 
We of to-day belong to the world instead of to a 
county, we have the conveniences of the woild 
at our doors, and we have large amounts of lei- 
sure time for service, amusement, or personal im-

provement which used to be demanded by the 
necessities of mere physical existence. 
Our development as a nation has been wonder- 
ful. The frontier has been pushed farther and 
farther to the West, and, finally pushed off into 
theocean. By 1850, fourteen new states had been 
added to the original thirteen, and these included 
every state east of the Mississippi River and all 
of the first tier of,states west of the river except 
Minnesota. To-day the nation reaches to the Pa- 
cific and includes forty-six states, with the last 
two of our mainland territories standing on the 
threshold waiting for admission. From alittle and 
an isolated Federation with an uncertain future 
we have grown into a strong nation and finally 
into a great world power, and we are situated in 
the centre of the theatre of action in the future. 
The problems now before us are more numerous 
and larger than ever before, and they call for 
men of large training and capacity. 
Our population practically doubled every 
twenty years between 1790 and 1850, doubled 
again by 1880, and will double again by 1915. 
With the rapid development of commerce and

manufacturing, cities developed rapidly after 
1825. In 1790, there were but six cities having a 
population of eight thousand or over, and these 
represented but 3.4 per cent of the total popula- 
tion; in 1810 there were but 11 such, represent- 
ing but 4.9 per cent; and as late as 1830 there 
were but 26 such cities, representing but 6.7 per 
cent. By 1850, the number of cities of eight'thou- 
sand inhabitants or over had increased to 85, re- 
presenting 13.5 per cent of the total population ; 
by 1870, to 226, representing 20.9 per cont by 
1890, to 447, representing 29.2 per “cent ; and 
by 1900, to 545, representing 33.1 per cent.” In 
1900, there were 38 cities having a population of 
100,000 or over, while 40.2 per cent of the entire 
population were classified as living in cities of 
2500 inhabitants or over. ; 
The growth of the city with us has been rapid 
indeed. The country resident and the immigrant 
have both been attracted to it in large numbers. 
The opportunities for trade and industry which 
the cities present have drawn many to them who 
have found great difficulty in adjusting them- 
selves to the new and peculiar life. They have 
9 -
-P-A-G-E-22
  CHANGING CONCEPTIONS 
drawn to them the most energetic and capable, 
as well as the most vicious and corrupt. The 
modern city is essentially a centre of trade and 
industry, and home life and home conditions are 
determined and conditioned by this fact. The 
increasing specialization in all fields of labor has 
divided the people into dozens of more or less 
clearly defined classes, and the increasing cen- 
” tralization of trade and industry has concentrated 
business in the hands of a relatively small number. 
The small merchant and employer are fast giving 
place to large mercantile and industrial concerns, 
No longer can a man save up a thousand dollars 
and start in business for himself with much chance 
of success. The employee tends to remain an 
employee ; the wage earner tends to remain a 
pe earner. New discoveries and improved ma- 
/ chinery have greatly increased the complexity of 
the industrial process in all lines of work, and the 
worker tends more and more to become a cog in 
the machine and to lose sight of his place and 
part in the industrial process. 
The character of our people, too, has greatly 
changed. In the earlier period the people of dif- 
Io
-P-A-G-E-23
  OF EDUCATION 
ferent regions were very homogeneous, and the 
commercial and intellectual independence of each 
community and the difficulty of intercommunica- 
tion tended to keep them so. The early people 
were largely of English stock. Their ancestors 
had brought with them many English customs 
and observances, English ways of thinking, and 
the English attitude toward religion and law. 
Though much changed and weakened since this 
early time, these English traditions have never 
ceased to influence the character of our national 
life. Where the people were not English in ori- 
gin, as in parts of Pennsylvania, Delaware, and 
New York, the English language gradually sup- 
planted the foreign tongue, English ways were 
in part adopted, and gradually the greater part 
of these people were assimilated as a part of 
our English-speaking and English-thinking na- 
tion. 
In 1820, our government began for the first 
time to keep a record of aliens arriving in this 
country. The number was small at first, but in 
1842 it reached 100,000, and since 1845 there 
have been but two years, both of them during 
IL

our Civil War, when the arrivals have been less 
than this number. Between 1905 and 1908, more 
than 1,000,000 arrived each year, and the total 
immigration since 1820 exceeds 27,500,000. 
The first to come in any great numbers were 
the Irish, driven out of Ireland by the potato 
famine of 1846, and by the oppressive system of 
landlordism which prevailed. Between 1845 and 
1855, a million and a quarter of poor, illiterate 
Irish immigrants landed on our shores, settling 
chiefly in the North Atlantic States. Again in 
1882, following another famine, Irish immigra- 
tion reached another high point, and in all over 
four millions of Irish have come to us since 1820. 
These people were very poor and uneducated. 
Less than one half of those who came in the 
early migration, and scarcely one fourth of those 
who came later, could read and write. 
From 1848 to 1852, and again from 1859 to 
1882, our country received great numbers of 
Germans, a total of about five and one quarter 
millions of Germans having come since 1820. 
Unlike the Irish who came earlier, the Germans 
were a picked and an educated class, the earlier 
12  
-P-A-G-E-25
  OF EDUCATION 
ones having left Germany because of political 
and religious oppression, and the later ones to 
escape forced military service or economic de- 
pression. They brought with them their liberal- 
ism in politics and religion, and for a time formed 
a segregated intellectual aristocracy in the East- 
ern and interior cities of the country. 
During the middle years of the nineteenth 
century, large numbers of English came, in alla 
total of about three and one-half millions having 
arrived since 1820. Still later, large numbers of 
Scandinavians arrived, these going largely to the 
agricultural sections of the Northwest. In all, 
nearly two millions of Scandinavians have come 
to our shores. 
While these people frequently settled in groups 
and retained for a time their foreign language, 
manners, and customs, they were nevertheless 
relatively easy to assimilate. All except the Irish 
came from countries where general education 
prevailed, and where progressive methods of 
agriculture, trade, and manufacturing had begun 
to supersede primitive methods. All were from 
race stock not very different from our own, and 
13 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
é   
CHANGING CONCEPTIONS 
all possessed courage, initiative, intelligence, 
adaptability and self-reliance to a large degree. 
The willingness, good nature, and executive 
qualities of the Irish, the intellectual thorough- 
ness of the German, the respect for law and 
order of the English, and the thrift of the Scan- 
dinavian have been good additions to our life) 
About 1882, the character of our immigration 
changed in a very remarkable manner. Immigra- 
tion from the north of Europe dropped off rather 
abruptly, and in its place immigration from the 
south and east of Europe set in and soon devel- 
oped into a great stream. After 1880, southern 
Italians and Sicilians; people from all parts of 
that medley of races known as the Austro-Hun- 
garian Empire, — Czechs, Moravians, Slovaks, 
Poles, Jews, Ruthenians, Croatians, Servians, 
Dalmatians, Slovenians, Magyars, Roumanians, 
Austrians ; and Slavs, Poles, and Jews from Rus- 
sia began to come in great numbers. After 1900, 
Finns from the north, driven out by Russian 
persecution; and Greeks, Syrians, and Arme- 
nians from the south, have come in great num- 
bers to our shores. 
14
-P-A-G-E-27
Of kpucaTion 
These southern and eastern Europeans are of 
a very different type from the north Europeans 
who preceded them. Illiterate, docile, lacking in 
self-reliance and initiative, and not possessing 
the Anglo-Teutonic conceptions of law, order, 
and government, their coming has served to 
dilute tremendously our national stock, and to 
corrupt our civic life. \The great bulk of these 
people have settled in the cities of the North 
Atlantic and North Central states, and the prob- 
lems of proper housing and living, moral and 
sanitary conditions, honest and decent govern- 
ment, and proper education have everywhere 
been made more difficult by their presence. 
Everywhere these people tend to settle in groups 
or settlements, and to set up here their_national 
manners, customs, and observancesf/Our task is 
to break up these groups or settlements, to as- 
similate and amalgamate these people as a part 
of our American race, and to implant in their 
children, so far as can be done, the Anglo-Saxon 
conception of righteousness, law and order, and 
popular government, and to awaken in them a 
reverence for our democratic institutions and for

those things in our national life which we as a 
people hold to be of abiding worth. ) 
\S As an accompaniment of these changes in our 
“mode of life and the nature of our population, 
there has ensued a general weakening of the old 
social customs and traditions which exercised so 
strong an educative influence during the early 
years of our national life. Nearly all of our early 
people were people of deep religious convictions. 
The church was a potent factor in their lives and 
exercised a much stronger influence than it does 
to-day. The minister was everywhere respected 
and looked up to by both parents and children. 
The young were trained to go to Sunday school 
and to church, and Sunday was observed as a 
day of rest and religious observances. A re- 
ligious sanction for acts of conduct was often 
set forth. The numbers of opportunities to do 
wrong and to go wrong were much smaller than 
they are to-day. Communities were small and 
homogeneous, and every one’s actions were every 
one’s business. The community code of conduct 
and community sentiment were strong restrain- 
ing and educative forces. The positive convic- 
16
-P-A-G-E-29
  OF EDUCATION 
tions of the older members of the community 
served to check the tendencies toward wayward- 
ness of both boys and girls. The home, too, ex- 
ercised a much stronger restraining and direct- 
ive influence over the children than is generally 
the case to-day. Children were taught obedience, 
proper demeanor, respect, courtesy, honesty, 
fidelity, and virtue. The master was required by 
law to look carefully after the manners and the 
morals of his apprentice as well as to teach him 
a trade, 
All ofthis was highly educative, along certain 
lines, to both the boy and the girl, served to keep 
many in the path of rectitude, and trained them 
for an honest anda respectable life. Inmany of our 
smaller and older communities these conditions 
persist, to a certain degree, though of necessity 
much modified by the conditions of modern life ; 
but in the cities, towns, and the newer portions of 
the country these old educative influences and 
traditions have largely broken down, or have en- 
tirely ceased to exist. The church has lost its in- 
fluence over the young, frequently they give it 
only a nominal allegiance, and many children 
17

grow up to-day without any religious training. 
The little homogeneous community with its lim- 
ited outlook and its clannish spirit is fast being 
displaced by semi-urban conditions, a much more 
cosmopolitan population, and a much freer and 
an easier life. The apprentice system has prac- 
tically gone. The amusements and temptations 
of life have been greatly multiplied. He attitude 
of the people toward the old problems has greatly 
changed. Parents everywhere are less strict than 
they used to be, and the attitude of many com- 
munities to-day, as expressed in their life, their 
newspapers, and their failure to enforce law, is 
really opposed to righteousness and good behav- 
ior. The home altogether too often is unintelli- 
gent or neglectful in the handling of children, 
and not infrequently it has abdicated entirely and 
has turned over to the public school the whole 
matter of the training and education of the young, 
“Along with these changes there has come not 
only a tremendous increase in the quantity of 
our knowledge, but also a demand for a large 
increase in the amount of knowledge necessary to 
enable one to meet the changed conditions of our 
18
-P-A-G-E-31

modern life. The kind of knowledge needed, too, 
has fundamentally changed. The ability to read 
and write and cipher no longer distinguishes the 
educated from the uneducated man. Aman must 
have better, broader, and a different kind of 
knowledge than did his parents if he is to suc- 
ceed under modern conditions. (Success is higher 
up the ladder now than it was a generation ago, 
while the crowd about the bottom of the ladder 
increases every year. |\Science has been freed 
and made the common possession of all, and 
its wonders have become so common that dis- 
coveries and inventions have almost ceased to 
awaken a feeling of wonder. Books, magazines, 
and newspapers bring knowledge of the latest 
discoveries, inventions, and improvements, as 
well as the world’s doings, to our doors. With 
the advent of factory life, the home has ceased to 
be a workshop ; and in our cities it has come to 
be little more than a sleeping and eating apart- 
ment. Factory life has also made it undesirable 
that children should labor. The result is that a 
boy or girl in our modern life has so little real 
home life, so much unprofitable leisure, and ac-

quires so much through the eyes and the ears and 
learns so little by actual doing, that the problem 
of providing a proper environment and of utiliz- 
ing this excess leisure time in profitable training 
has become one of the most serious as well as 
one of the most difficult problems now before us. 
» The school, begun at first as a means of impart- 
ing to children the common rudiments of learn- 
ing, has gradually been transformed into one 
of the most important institutions of democracy

larger light. , 
-. The effect of all these changes in our mode of 
living is written large on our national life. The 
industrial and social revolution which we have 
experienced has been far-reaching in its conse- 
quences, and the “good old times” of our grand- 
fathers are gone, never to return. In their place, 
we have a new and a vastly more complex civili-

cialization of human effort, and new and ever 
more difficult social and industria] problems

awaiting solution. The specialization of labor and 
effort has been applied to all fields of work. We 
have been made dependent even for the necessi- 
ties of life upon the commerce of remote regions 
and distant peoples toan extent that it is difficult 
for us to understand. The world has become 
very much smaller than it used to be, and its 
parts have become interdependent to an extent 
never known before.

CHANGES IN THE CONCEP- 
TION OF THE SCHOOL 
Tue early colonial school of New England was 
a semi-private and asemi-religious institution. 
Its curriculum was limited to reading, writing, 
ciphering, and religion. Writing, being a more 
difficult art, was frequently taught by a special 
teacher. Education was insisted on chiefly for 
religious reasons. Salvation being deemed an in- 
dividual matter, and the Bible indicating the way, 
it was very desirable that every one should be 
able to read it for himself. Family instruction 
was a common practice, though dames and itin- 
erant schoolmasters eked out a precarious living 
by giving instruction. The division of labor had 
not as yet been applied to education to any ex- 
tent. Teaching was still in the household stage 
asan industry. The chief educational interest of 
25

  CHANGING CONCEPTIONS 
the colonies, aside from the desire that all should 
be able to read the Holy Word, lay in grammar 
school and collegiate training, that a supply of 
properly trained ministers might be insured. 
There was no direct connection between these 
higher schools and elementary instruction, ft 
was essentially a period of middle-class education, 
and along the lines of English traditions) These 
conditions continued until well on into the first 
quarter of the nineteenth century. 
This early period was one in which the need 
of general or extensive education was relatively 
small. The education most useful was the edu- 
cation of common experience. Everywhere the 
right to vote and to hold office was restricted. 
The possession of a certain number of acres of 
land, of an estate of a certain value, or of an an- 
nual income of a certain amount was necessary 
to vote, while to hold office still more rigid prop- 
erty qualifications were required. In a number 
of states there were religious restrictions as well, 
and in a few taxes were collected for the support 
of the established churches. There was little need 
for much education to meet the simple and un- 
26 
 
-P-A-G-E-39
OF EDUCATION 
differentiated conditions of this early period, and 
little opportunity existed for obtaining it. 
The ability to read, to write, and to cipher dis- 
tinguished the educated from the uneducated 
man, while the amount of general knowledge 
possessed by even the better educated would 
seem to us relatively small. 
During the early decades of the nineteenth 
century, schools and the means of education made 
little progress. There were among the founders 
of our states certain far-seeing men who wished 
for general public education, but it was well along 
toward the middle of the century before these 
men represented more than a hopeful minority & 
in most of our states, and in the South little was 
done until after the Civil War. Even in Massa- 
chusetts, pioneer as this state has been in so 
much that has been good, the revival of inter- 
est in education dates from the establishment of 
the State Board of Education and the appoint- 
ment of Horace Mann as its Secretary in 1837. 
Popular education was the dream of the reformer 
rather than the conviction of the people, and 
popular and free education at public expense 
27

was still further removed from the realms of the 
necessary or the possible. 
Few of the problems of democracy which we 
are trying so hard to solve to-day by means of 
public education had as yet presented them- 
selves for solution, and the need of a general sys- 
tem of tax-supported schools was evident to but 
a few. To be illiterate was no reproach, and it 
was possible to follow many pursuits successfully 
without having received any other education than 
the education of daily work and experience. A 
large proportion of the people felt that those who 
desired an education should pay for it. As the 
Rhode Island farmer expressed it to Henry Bar- 
nard in 1844, it would be as sensible to propose 
to take his plough away from him to plough his 
neighbor’s field as to take his money to educate 
his neighbor's child. Others felt that at most free 
education should be extended only to the chil- 
dren of the poor, and for the rudiments of learning 
only. Still others felt that all forms of education 
would be conducted best if turned over to the 
various religious and educational societies of the 
time. A system of public instruction maintained

by general taxation, such as we to-day enjoy, 
would not only have been declared unnecessary, 
a would have been stoutly resisted as well. 
/The best schools, and often the only schools, 
' were private schools supported by the tuition fees 
of those who could afford to use them, and most 
of these were more or less directly under church 
connie 
/ Not until after the beginning of the nineteenth 
century was education regarded at all as a legiti- 
\ mate public function. At the time of the forma- 
tion of the Federal Constitution, education was 
not considered of sufficient importance to receive 
mention in the document; and so far as there is 
any recorded mention of the subject in the de- 
bates of the constitutional convention, it refers 
to a national university and not to public educa- 
tion. The reasons for this are easy to see. Edu- 
«cation was then a luxury and not a necessity. 
For centuries it had been the possession of the 
gentleman and not of the common man. The de- 
centralized district system of administration and 
the theory of individual, and community rights 
reigned supreme. The provision of schools was 
29  
-P-A-G-E-42
  CHANGING CONCEPTIONS 
entirely a local and an optional matter. The in. 
dustrial movement awakened by the Embargo of 
1807 and the War of 1812 had not as yet resulted 
in the substitution of the factory system for do- 
mestic industry and in the specialization of labor. 
The development of new means of intercom- 
munication had not as yet come to break up the 
homogeneity and independence of the villages. 
The development of manufacturing centres and 
labor organizations had not as yet begun to exert 
their influence. The different humanitarian 
movements which arose after 1820, and which, 
among other things, demanded public tax-sup- 
ported schools for all, had not as yet made them- 
selves felt. The people were poor, and indiffer- 
ent-as to education. 
( Gradually, and only after great effort, this con- 
ition of apathy and indifference was changed to 
one of active interest, though the change took 
place but slowly, and differed in point of time in 
different parts of the country.\The Lancastrian 
system of monitorial instruction (by which a 
single teacher with the assistance of his best 
students, called monitors, taught hundreds of

pupils), introduced into this country from Eng- 
land about 1806, for the first time made an ele- 
mentary school training for all seem possible, 
from a financial point of view. The first schools 
in a number of Eastern cities were Lancastrian 
schools, and the introduction of this system tre- 
mendously stimulated the movement for general 
education. The “charity-school” conception of 
education, by which free tuition was to be pro- 
vided only for the children of the deserving poor, 
and which also came over from England at a 
slightly earlier date, was after a time eliminated 
as a conception dangerous to the future of our 
free institutions. 
The idea that free education was a right, and 
that universal education was a necessity, began 
to be urged and to find acceptance. The land 
grants of Congress to the new states for the 
benefit of common schools greatly stimulated the 
movement. The published reports of those who 
had visited Pestalozzi’s school in Switzerland, 
and had examined the new state school system 
in Prussia, were extensively read. The moral and 
economic advantages of schools were set forth 
31

at length in resolutions, speeches, pamphlets, 
magazines, and books. 
By 1835, a marked change had taken place in 
tle! attitude of society toward many questions. 
Religi<22"prerequisites for office and taxes for 
the svpport of religion had been withdrawn; im- 
prisor/ ‘ent for debt had been abandoned ; humani- 
tarianfreedeien, and labor organizations were 
gaining rapidly in power; and the elective fran- 
chise had been widened so as to provide for 
universal suffrage in almost every state. The 
unexpected shortcomings which had revealed 
themselves in legislatures and officials had raised 
the faith in the common people to a maximum. 
Elective offices, with short terms, were increased 
in number. State constitutions were revised so 
as to limit more narrowly and to define more 
exactly the powers and duties of those entrusted 
with office. The need of an educated electorate 
began.to be felt, and the new state constitutions 
began to instruct the legislatures to provide for 
common schools, and to create new elective 
officers to look after the interests of the schools, 
the school lands, and the school funds, 
32

Just when this change took place cannot be 
definitely stated. Roughly speaking, it began 
about 1825 and was accomplished by 1850 in the 
Northern states. It was a gradual change rat’ or 
than a sudden one, though rapid adva: were 
at times made. The movement everywhere was 
greatly stimulated by the educational re val in- 
augurated by Horace Mann in More tts in 
1837. In the Southern states, with one or two ex- 
ceptions, little was accomplished until after the 
Civil War and the Reconstruction Period were 
over. Almost everywhere it took place only after 
prolonged agitation, and ofttimes only after a bit- 
ter struggle. The indifference of legislatures, the 
unwillingness of taxpayers to assume the burdens 
of general taxation, the small sense of local re- 
sponsibility, the satisfaction with existing condi- 
tions, the old aristocratic conception of education, 
the pauper and charity-school idea, and frequently 
the opposition of denominational and private 
schools, — all of these had to be met and over- 
come. The referendum was tried in a number of 
states, and sometimes more than once; in others, 
the question of free schools became a vital polit-

ical issue. The work of such men as Horace 
Mann in Massachusetts, Henry Barnard in Con- 
necticut and, Rhode Island, John D. Pierce in 
Michigan, and Caleb Mills in Indiana stand as 
conspicuous examples of men who labored against 
the ignorance and inertia of their times for the 
establishment of the free public school. 
|By 1850, the principle of tax-supported schools 
had been generally accepted in all of the Northern 
states, and the beginnings of free schools made 
in some of the Southern states. ‘Six state normal 
schools had been established, a number of states 
had provided for State Superintendents of Com- 
mon Schools and for ex-officio State Boards of 
Education, and the movement for state control 
of education had begun. It may be said that it 
had now become a settled conviction with a may 
jority of the people that the provision of some 
form of free education was a duty of the state, 
and that such education contributed in a general 
way, though just how was not at that time clear, 
to the moral uplift of the people, to a higher civic 
virtue, and to increased economic returns to the 
state. A new conception of free public education 
\ 34
-P-A-G-E-47
OF EDUCATION 
as a birthright of the child on the one hand, and 
as an exercise of the state’s inherent right to 
self-preservation and improvement on the other, 
had taken the place of the earlier conception of 
schools as merely a codperative effort, based on 
economy, and for the instruction of youth merely 
_ in the rudiments of learning\ The large immigra- 
tion of illiterate Irish and clannish Germans which 
set in in the late forties gave particular emphasis 
to this point of view. 
Public education was thus for the first time 
definitely established as a national interest. In 
the states west of the Alleghany Mountains, the 
principle of state support was more definitely es- 
tablished, and has been carried further than in the 
states to the east. General taxation for elemen- 
tary schools was established, and a state univer- 
sity definitely provided for by all. Almost all of the 
states subsequently formed to the westward have 
established general state taxation, and all have 
provided for a state university for the higher 
education of their children. 
The schools at first provided were of an ele- 
mentary and a rudimentary nature only. Reading,

writing, spelling, and arithmetic constituted al- 
most the entire curriculum at first. Grammar, 
geography, and history were added a little later. 
The term was short, and a small tuitigén fee, in 
the form of the “rate-bill,” was usually charged 
to supplement the small income from school 
funds and from taxation. Those who could not 
pay the charge were usually admitted as indi- 
gents, much as text-books are now supplied to 
indigents in some of our states. A “fuel tax” 
was also charged for a time, and admission was 
denied to those whose parents had not provided 
their quota of wood. The opportunities for edu- 
cation were small until after the Civil War. It 
has been estimated by the United States Com- 
‘/missioner of Education that, taking all public 
" and private forms of education and adding them 
together, each individual in the population on an 
average received only 82 days of education dur- 
ing his lifetime in 1800, only 208 days in 1840, 
and only 434 days in 1860, By 1880, the number 
had reached 792 days ; and by 1900, it had reached 
998 days. A short winter term, with a subscrip- 
tion school in the spring, was a common pro-

ceeding. School Zeeping was the rule rather than 
school ¢eaching. The method of instruction for a 
long time was almost entirely individual. Grad- 
ing of pupils and uniformity in text-books were 
for a long time unknown. The children studied 
their lessons and worked their sums, and when 
these were mastered they went up and recited 
what they had learned. Those who could work 
well alone succeeded; the others made only in- 
different progress, and soon became discouraged 
and quit. 
Gradually, after the principle of public support 
had become established in the minds of the 
people and the method of procedure had been 
definitely settled in the courts, this condition of 
affairs was changed, though the change took 
place at first but slowly. The free-school move- 
ment was greatly retarded by the anti-slavery 
agitation, the Civil War, and the Reconstruction 
Period. The cities were the first to throw off the 
“rate-bill” and to provide absolutely free schools. 
By 1860, it had been abolished in most of thestates, 
and in 1871 the last state, New Jersey, did away 
with this objectionable provision. Taxes were 
37

slowly increased in amount, and the school term 
was slowly lengthened. /The extension of in- 
struction to include secondary education was a 
natural outcome, though secondary schools were 
not established in any numbers until after the 
Civil War, and almost everywhere the right to 
do so was fought out in the legislatures, or before 
the people, and was then unsuccessfully questioned 
in the courts. 
The years immediately following the Civil 
War were a period of great industrial activity and 
national development. The cities experienced a 
very rapid growth; new enterprises were launched 
in all directions; factories were started for the 
manufacture of many new kinds of articles ; ma- 
chinery of many new types was introduced ; 
there was renewed activity in railroad building ; 
the West was opened up; immigration from the 
north of Europe reached a maximum, and that 
from the south and east of Europe began. 
/T he many social and industrial changes which

\ tional functions of the home, and marked the end 
of the apprenticeship system as a useful means

of education./ Life and industry became dynamic, 
and methods of procedure and instruction suited 
to static conditions completely broke down.J The 
overwhelming success of the Prussian armies in 
the War of 1870 with France called new attention 
to the importance of public education. “The 
Prussian schoolmaster has triumphed,” was as- 
serted on all sides. The business men of Mas- 
sachusetts, returning from the London exhibition 
of 1867, petitioned the legislature to introduce 
drawing into the public schools of the state. 
The law of 1868, the importation of a supervisor 
of drawing from England in 1870, and the es- 
tablishment of the Boston Normal Art School in 
1875 were the results. The exhibit of the Rus- 
sian government at the Centennial Exhibition of 
1876 revealed to us the value of manual training. 
Inthe early seventies, the kindergarten idea came 
to America from Germany, and was soon recog- 
nized as a valuable addition. In the eighties, the 
Herbartian conception wf education, with its 
emphasis on proper psychological procedure and 
on character-building as the aim of education, 
began to reshape our educational theory.

During the quarter of a century from 1875 to 
1900, the common school experienced a marked 
change in method and in direction. The old 
limited curriculum for disciplinary purposes could 
no longer meet the changed conditions of our 
national life. The school was asked to concen- 
trate its energy to some more definite purpose, 
to train the eye and the hand for direct and 
useful action, and to prepare more definitely its 
pupils for personal usefulness in life. Drawing, 
manual-training, domestic science, laboratory in- 
struction, and the kindergarten began to demand 
recognition in the course of study. Music was 
advocated for its cultural and inspirational value, 
and elementary science— nature study — began 
to crowd arithmetic and grammar on the basis 
of practical usefulness in life. Old conservative 
schoolmasters, unaware of the changed conditions 
and the new problems before us, spoke sneeringly 
of these new “fads and frills,” but despite such 
opposition the school has been compelled to 
admit and to makea place for these new subjects, 
and to direct its energies toward a new and a 
higher purpose. In all this, the cities have been

the leaders, while the country school has done 
little or nothing to adapt itself to the changed 
conditions of our life. The process is as yet by 
no means completed. There are many commu- 
nities and some normal schools which as yet have 
not been touched by the modern spirit in educa- 
tion. Sooner or later, though, these slow and 
conservative communities and schools will be 
forced to take up their share of the educational 
burden, and to provide the kind of training which 
they should. 
\/ By 1900, it may be said that our public schools 
had been transformed from mere teaching insti- 
tutions, where a disciplinary training in the rudi- 
ments of learning was given, and had been called 
upon to undertake some of the educational func- 
tions no longer provided either by the home or 
in the shop. The industrial capabilities and the 
character of the child were now to be shaped, 
some better preparation to meet the changed 
conditions of life was to be given, and the school 
was also called upon anew to help assimilate the 
increasing number and the changing type of 
aliens coming to our shores. In the cities this

became a serious question, and many additions 
and concessions had to be made, especially to the 
Germans, to get their children into our Ameri- 
can public schools instead of their alien paro- 
chial schools. The period from 1875 to 1900 
was a period of discussion and criticism. Prac- 
tical men took the public school severely to task, 
and pointed out the shortcomings of the old 
type of training. The proceedings of the edu- 
cational associations of the time are filled with 
discussions as to the need and value of the new 
subjects, and the desired changes in the nature 
of the school itself. The school was forced to 
become conscious of itself, and it became criti- 
cal of its aims and of its methods of procedure. 
The psychology of instruction and discussions 
as to the relative value of subjects now came to 
the front. Normal schools for the proper train- 
ing of teachers, both public and private, began 
to be founded in numbers. The new subject of 
“pedagogy,” a term expressive of the conception 
of public education at that time, now began to 
be grudgingly received into the more demo- 
cratic of our universities.,/The influence of the

new doctrine of evolution also began to be appar« 
ent, and a conception of the child as a slowly de- 
veloping personality, demanding subject matter 
and method suited to his stage of development, 
now began to take the place of the earlier pouring- 
in-of-information conception, Child study for a 
time almost monopolized the educational field. 
Books on the curriculum, on child life, and on 
methods of teaching were now published numer- 
ously. Character-building was erected as a defi- 
nite aim in education, Psychology became the 
guiding science of the school. 
In all of these changes of a quarter of a cen- 
tury, the school has gained tremendously in dig- 
nity, power, and influence. The old do-as-you- 
please policy had to be abandoned. Permission 
was changed to obligation all along the line. 
Minimum requirements were laid down, and these 
have been gradually advanced. New and higher 
requirements for those who are to teach have 
been instituted. The new subjects of instruc- 
tion have found a place in the system, and the 
system itself has been broadened and added to

school has become a truly national institution. 
New taxes have been provided, old forms of tax- 
ation have been increased, and the school funds 
have been more carefully guarded. Aid for pri- 
vate, sectarian, and denominational schools has 
been cut off, and that question forever settled. 
Bulky school codes have been developed ; new 
constitutions have made very definite provisions 
* for state school systems, and have laid very posi- 
tive mandates on the legislatures “to provide an 
efficient system of free public schools”’ for all 
the children of the state. School legislation has 
become an important part of the work of each 
session of the legislature. The right of the state 
has been asserted and sustained by the courts. 
Education for all at public expense has come to 
be accepted as a settled conviction of our people. 
The right to compel the child to partake of the 
advantages offered has also been established, 
and is now in the process of being generally ac- 
cepted. So thoroughly have we come to be actu- 
ated by a common purpose that we often find 
ourselves speaking of the American public

systems, though within recent years they have 
become truly national in spirit. All of this had 
been thoroughly established in principle before 
the end of the last century, but it may take an- 
other generation to establish it thoroughly in 
the schools. Our national development advances 
faster than our educational practice.

Tue Spanish-American War of 1898 and the 
recent Russo-Japanese War served alike to con- 
centrate attention once more on the advantages 
of general education. It was “the man behind 
the gun” who won in each case. These wars, 
and other more or less related events, have 
served to bring out into new relief our position 
in the family of nations, and to reveal to us some- 
thing of the part we shall probably be called 
upon to play in the world’s affairs in the future. 
Our location, our resources, our capacity, and, 
not least, the high moral and humanitarian pur- 
poses which actuate us as a nation, are certain to 
make our influence felt in the affairs of the world 
in the future. We are slowly beginning to see, as

or naval, and that it is our duty to get ready for 
them if we wish to continue to prosper as a na- 
tion. The trained artisan is to be the private; the 
trained leader the captain; and an educated, 
sober, capable, and industrious people the base 
of supplies for the national armies of the future. 
hether we like it or not, we are beginning to 
see that we are pitted against the world in a 
gigantic battle of brains and skill, with the mar- 
kets of the world, work for our people, and in- 
ternal peace and contentment as the prizes at 
\ stake. 
From _ 1897 to 1907, our..country experienced 
an unprecedented period of industrial develop- 
ment and national prosperity. It was a period 
marked by the concentration of capital and busi- 
“ness enterprises in all fields; undertakings on a 
scale heretofore unattempted were begun ; capi- 
tal changed from a national to an international 
basis; “trusts,” combinations, and associations 
were formed in all lines of business; the special- 
ization of labor and the introduction of labor- 
saving machinery took place to an extent before 
unknown; new inventions destroyed old trades

for, and readjustments are not easy to make, and 
cannot be made at once. ‘The need of broad,

standing on the threshold of a new era in educa-

educational societies and associations which have 
been formed, and the number of congresses which 9 
have been held to promote some one phase or 
another of educational work, is so large that one 
can scarcely remember their names. The great

education by many laymen, are certainly signifi- 
cant. The many state educational commissions 
which have been created within the past five 
years indicate a general dissatisfaction with~ex- 
isting conditions and a desire for change.and im- 
provement. The new interest in school hygiene 
and the physical welfare of the child indicates a 
new and a commendable desire to care for the 
bodies as well as the heads of our children. The 
great educational lessons to be learned from a 
study of the educational, political, and industrial 
progress of the German Empire during the past 
forty years are at last beginning to take root with 
us. Above all, the new and extensive interest in 
industrial and vocatiofal training is especially 
significant of the changing conception of the 
function of the school and the classes in society 
which the school is in future expected to serve. 
A right-about-face movement, too, is taking 
place in our educational breory. When the school 
first became conscious and critical of itself ~it 
turned to methods and class-room procedure for 
lines of improvement, and psychology became its 
fundamental science. Its gaze was turned inward

upon itself. Many reforms and improvements in 
methods and in the teaching process were made, 
but the advances in organization and in the en- 
richment of the curriculum have nearly all been 
forced upon the school by practical men from 
without. The school now shows signs of becoming 
conscious of itself in a new and a truer direction; 
its gaze is now outward instead of inward, and 
the relation of the school to the world outside has 
now become a question of the first importance in 
educational procedure. fie school is essentially 
a time and labor saving device, created — with 
us—by democracy to serve democracy’s needs. 
To convey to the next generation the knowledge 
and the accumulated experience of the past is not 
its only rains It must equally prepare the 
future citizen for the to-morrow of our complex life. 
The school must grasp the significance of its social 
connections and relations, and must come to real- 
ize that its real worth®ind its hope of adequate 
reward lies in its social efficiencyfThere are 
many reasons for believing that this change is 
taking place rapidly at present, and that an educa- 
tional sociology, needed as much by teachers to-

day as an educational psychology, is now in the 
process of being formulated for our use. 
Child life is everywhere experiencing to-day a 
new lengthening of the period of dependence and 
training. In proportion as our social life becomes 
broader and more complex, a longer period of 
guidance becomes necessary to prepare the in- 
dividual for active participation in it. As our in- 
' dustrial life becomes narrower and its processes 
more concealed, new and more extended training 
is called for to prepare the future worker for his 
task, to reveal to him something of the intricacy 
and interdependence of our modern, social, and 
industrial life, and to point out to him the neces- 
sity of each’ man’s part. With the ever increasing 
subdivision and specialization of labor, the danger 
from class subdivision is constantly increasing, 
and the task is thrown more and more upon the 
school of instilling into all a social and a politi- 
cal consciousness that will lead to unity amid 
diversity, and to united action forthe preserva- 
tion and betterment of our democratic institutions,

industrial classes, many of whom are illiterate 
and few of whom have any real conception of 
the meaning of democratic life, add new empha- 
sis to this point of view. Five or six months of 
common school education each year for a few 
years are no longer enough, and on all sides the 
school year is being lengthened and the educa- 
tional requirements increased. So marked has 
been the change in this direction within recent 
years, that sixteen years of age bids fair to be the 
earliest time at which we will, ultimately, permit 
children to entirely cease attendance at some 
form of the public school. 
“Our school curriculum bids fair, too, to experi- 
ence many modifications during the next one or 
two decades, and chiefly along a line that will lead 
toward preparation for increased social efficiency. 
Much antiquated material, adapted largely to the 
needs of a society that has preceded us, will 
doubtless be eliminated. New subjects and new 
points of emphasis in old subjects, better adapt- 
ing the school to our changed and changing so- 
cial and industrial life, will probably be added. 
Our city schools will soon be forced to give up 
56

the exceedingly democratic idea that all are equal, 
and that our society is devoid of classes, as a few 
cities have already in large part done, and to be- 
gin a specialization of educational effort along 
many new lines in an attempt better to adapt the 
school to the needs of these many classes in the 
city life. City, town, and country schools alike 
have, in the past, directed most of their training 
to satisfying the needs of the children of the well- 
to-do classes, and those headed for business life 
or the professions. More recently, most of the 
larger cities have provided some form of work 
leading to preparation for the executive positions 
in technical pursuits. The common wage earners, 
* those who enter the industries as workmen, and 
the country boy and girl have been forced to 
take what was provided for the others, or to do 
without. 
The situation has been somewhat analogous to 
that of the old colleges, with their Latin, Greek, 
and Mathematics curriculumand their small stu- 
dent body and limited support. With theintroduc- 
tion of many new lines of work and the.demo- 
cratization of all instruction, the colleges have

experienced a great increase in students and in 
popular favor and support. Our public schools are 
at present experiencing some such change, and 
At is one that is likely to increase rather than to 
| / Mminish with time. Vocational schools and spe- 
cial type schools of many kinds are likely soon to 
find a place in our moreimportant school systems, 
There is some reason to hope, too, that the aim 
and direction of the country school and the small 
town school will also change, and that in the fu- 
ture these will seriously turn their attention to 
the needs of rural life. Ever since the establish- 
ment of rural schools they have been giving in- 
struction of a kind which has led to the city 
rather thantothefarm, The introduction of man- 
ual training, domestic science, and agriculture 
would do much toward making the country school 
and the small town school a more useful social 
institution. 
\A very significant change has also taken place 
Since 1900 in the attitude assumed toward the 
study of education ,by our higher institutions of 
learning. The study of education, rather than 
the old “pedagogy,” has recently become an im- 
58
-P-A-G-E-71

portant part of the work of most of our colleges 
and universities. Instead of a study of school 
methods and management only, the work has 
changed into a phase of political science, —that 
of a study of means of improving the state and of 
advancing the public welfare. Nearly all of our 
universities and colleges now have such chairs or 
departments, and the state universities and our 
more democratic private institutions are now or- 
ganizing professional schools for the training of 
teachers and educational leaders for the state. 
. Active, capable, and mature young men are 
studying the subject, and many are preparing 
themselves for leadership in the work which will 
soon have to be done. The work begins at last 
to offer a good career, and the opportunities for 
useful service are almost unparalleled. The in- 
struction offered in a number of our normal 
schools has been revised recently to make it 
conform better to the new conception, and many 
indications point to education as a future high 
school subject of study, with ultimately a unit of 
credit for college entrance. Surely a study of the 
history, aims, purposes, and functions of public 
59

? 
CHANGING CONCEPTIONS 
education in a democratic society such as our 
own ought to beas useful, either as a preparation 
for participation in active life, or for the thinking 
required of a college Freshman, as is the study of 
the History of Medizeval Europe, or the reading 
of four books of Czesar. 
     
     The administration of education each year be- 
omes a more important and a more dignified 
iece of work. If we could only cast off the an- 
iquated and unsatisfactory method of awarding 
the selection of state and county superintendents 
to the Republican and Democratic parties, and 
open up these places to the competition of the 
brains of the whole country, as we have done with 
the high school principalship and the city super- 
intendency, these positions would become among 
the most important within the gift of the state. 
The office of superintendent of city schools has 
in many places become one of much dignity and 
importance, and the office is being completely 
divorced from partisan or personal politics by all 
progressive communities. State Superintendents 
of Public Instruction and State Boards of Edu- 
cation are being entrusted with new functions, 
60
-P-A-G-E-73
  OF EDUCATION 
and a marked tendency toward a centralization 
of power and responsibility is manifest in many 
states. There is even good reason to believe that at- 
last Congress has been touched by the new spirit 
in education, and that it will, before long, per- 
form the long-delayed task of raising the national 
Bureau of Education from a position inferior to 
that of the life-saving service, the bureau of fish 
and fisheries, or the meat-inspection service, to 
a position commensurate with the importance of 
education to us as a nation. 
A people who express themselves as completely 
as we do in free political institutions, and whose 
whole life is experiencing such rapid changes and 
advances as our own, is increasingly dependent 
on education for guidance and progress. As a 
nation we have been slow to realize this. We 
have cared for higher or university education 
relatively well, and our secondary schools are in 
many places well provided for, but our elemen- 
tary, supplementary, continuation, and voca- 
tional schools have been as yet but imperfectly 
developed. The recent German commission sent 
to this country to investigate our educational 
61
-P-A-G-E-74
CHANGING CONCEPTIONS 
conditions mentioned this as one of our most vul- 
nerable points. 
The new period of advance which we now seem 
to be entering also bids fair to be very paternal- 
istic, perhaps even socialistic, in the matter of 
education. The old principle, fought for so vig- 
orously fifty or sixty years ago, that the wealth 
of the state must educate the children of the 
state, bids fair to be even further extended with 
a view to a greater equalization of both the bur- 
dens and the advantages of education. Poor and 
overburdened towns and districts will be supplied 
with sufficient means to enable them to provide 
a good school for their children, and the present 
great difference in tax rates, to provide practically 
the same educational advantages, will be in large 
part equalized by the state. There is, as yet, a 
small but a very significant tendency for the 
school to free itself from the financial control of 
the town board or city council, and to erect itself 
as an independent anda coordinate branch of the 
town or city government, responsible only to the 
people for its work and its expense.’ There are 
many signs of an increasing centralization of 
62  
-P-A-G-E-75
  
- OF EDUCATION 
management which will ultimately lead to greater 
efficiency. Many options which communities have 
to-day will in time be changed into obligations. 
The state oversight of private and parochial edu- 
cation is likely to increase slowly, especially 
along the lines of uniformity in statistics and rec- 
ords, sanitary inspection, common standards of 
work, andthe enforcement of the attendancelaws. 
In particular, the attitude toward.the control of 
the child is likely to change. Each year the child 
is coming to belong more and more to the state, 
and less and less tothe parent. In all that relates 
to proper care, kindness, education, and advan- 
tages, the child belongs to the parent; but 
when neglect, abuse, and the deprivation of the 
child of any natural right takes place, the child 
belongs to the state. The right to reasonably 
good treatment, proper care, an education, pro- 
tection from vice, and protection from labor be- 
yond his strength and years, the state will soon 
guarantee. The plea in defense that “the child 
is my child” will not be accepted much longer 
by society. Our future welfare is too thoroughly in 
the keeping of the child to permit of such a policy.

, \ movement, Everywhere west of the Alleghany

in all of the advantages provided. The masses, 
who have been the voting strength of the move- 
ment, have seen in it a chance for their children 
to rise, and educators and statesmen have seen 
in it the safety of the republic. School systems 
with us are thoroughly democratic. An educa- 
tional ladder for all who can afford it and have 
the mental capacity to use it extends from the   
kindergarten or primary school to and through 
the state university. Only in the states of the 
North Atlantic group, Maine alone excepted, 
has there been a failure to carry the system to 
its logical conclusion at the top. 
The evils and shortcomings of democracy are 
many and call loudly for remedies and improve- 
ment. Whether we shall have remedies and im- 
provement or not depends very largely on how 
the next generation is trained. The ideas taught 
in the school to-day become the actuating princi- 
ples of democracy to-morrow. Because the school 
64
-P-A-G-E-77

is so thoroughly a democratic institution and 
responds so quickly to democratic sentiment, the 
_ school has for long hesitated to touch, except in 
a very cautious manner, many of the evils and 
shortcomings of democracy. The greatest obsta- 
cle to intelligent educational and social progress 
is the lack of intelligence and grasp of demo- 
cracy itself. It takes time and patience to educate 
and move the mass, yet in some way the school 
must touch these sores. Our state governments 
are weak and inefficient, we say ; the school must 
then teach, and teach in some effective manner, 
the principles of strong and effective government. 
Our city governments are corrupt, we hear; 
fundamental moral and economic principles must 
then be taught to the masses, so that they may 
realize the importance of civic righteousness, and 
understand as well who ultimately pays the bills 
for all mismanagement. Our people waste their 
money and their leisure in idle and profligate ways, 
we say ; a knowledge of values and of howto utilize 
leisure time must then be taught. The list might 
be prolonged over pages, with similar conclusions. 
Through all the complicated machinery of the 
65

  CHANGING CONCEPTIONS 
school, some way must be found to awaken a social 
consciousness as oppdsed to class consciousness, 
to bring out the important social and civic les- 
sons, to point out our social and civic rfeeds, and 
to teach our young people how to live better and 
to make better use of their leisure time. Read- 
ing, Writing, Arithmetic, Grammar, Geography, 
and History, the staples of the elementary cur- 
riculum, are really of little value except as they 
are closely related with the needs and problems 
of-our social, civic, and industrial life. 
’This new conception shifts the emphasis in 
education from methods to men, and this new 
conception has underlain many. of the better 
courses of study issued for our schools during re- 
cent years. It also underlies much of the discus- 
sion of the present time./Teachers as a body, 
though, are not thoroughly conscious of such a 
purpose or need, ang courses of study alonecannot 
produce results. /If our schools are to become

conditions to be ni Our teaching force is com- 
posed largely of wonfen, and women are seldom 
interested by nature in this point of view. Their 
training for generations has been along different 
lines. Those teachers who enter the work wholly 
by examination have little opportunity ever to 
acquire this point of view, and the examination 
door should be closed as soon as financial con- 
ditions will permit. The time to impart ideals is 
during the training period, and an introduction to 
the social point of view and the social and indus- 
trial problems before us as anation ought to bean 
essential part 0f the training of every normal school. 
A normal school which is essentially an appren- 
tice school will inevitably turn out teachers with 
limited vision and little power of growth, while the 
call to-day for far-sighted teachers of large adap- 
tability is greater than ever before in our history. 
The work of public education is destined in 
the near future to be one of the most important 
lines of work which our republic has to do. Its 
importance in a government such as ours can 
scarcely be overestimated. Each man with us

his own destiny. It is within his power to do great 
good or to do great harm. To decide righteously 
and to act wisely he must know. Knowledge and 
training, if of the right type, can hardly be pro- 
vided too extensively. The overeducated man is 
scarcely possible if an education adapted to his 
needs and station in life is given him. The work 
of public education is with us, too, to a large de- 
gree, a pieceof religious work. To engage in it is 
to enlist in the nation’s service. Its call is for 
those who would dedicate themselves in a noble 
way. ‘Those who would serve must be of the 
world, with red~blood in their veins; they must 
know the world, its needs, afd its problems ; they 
must have largeness of vision, and the courage to 
do and to dare; and they must train the youth 
with whom they gome in contact for useful and 
efficient action. ,-

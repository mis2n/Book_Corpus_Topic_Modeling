PUBLISHER’S PREFACE 
Cuemistry is a closed book to many of us. 
. We regard it as something difficult, hard to 
understand, and remote, when as a matter of fact 
it is inherently one of the most interesting of sub- 
jects. Instead of being remote, it is part and 
parcel of our daily lives. It sums up the whole 
process of nature. Each one of our every-day 
habits—eating, drinking, breathing—is nothing 
more nor less than a chemical reaction. 
The recent World War brought us to a sharp 
realization of just what chemistry may mean for 
us in the future, either for weal or woe. On the 
one hand it produced insidious gases, powerful 
explosives and the deadliest agents of destruction 
that the world ever witnessed. On the other, it 
came to the aid of more than one nation by sup- 
plying nitrates for the soil and artificial clothing. 
and foodstuffs. 
To make us acquainted with some of the won- 
ders of every-day chemistry is the purpose of this 
book. It is not concerned with the scientific side 
except incidentally. The author is a practical 
experimenter who knows whereof he speaks, and 
better still knows how to tell the reader about it
-P-A-G-E-7
PREFACE 
in understandable language. He takes us behind 
the scenes, as it were, and points out the marvel- 
lous little elves called “ atoms” actually at work. 
He presupposes no advance knowledge as he 
takes the reader on this fascinating trip through 
his Jaboratory. He first discusses the wonders 
of air and water, and that modern magic, liquid 
air. Then he takes up common acids and salts, 
metals and alloys, gases, explosives, and other 
topics of live interest. We learn something of 
the magic of coal tar, from which the most beauti- 
ful colors and delicate flavors are obtained. There 
are talks on photography, artificial diamonds, 
radium, and the electric blast furnace with its 
heat running into the thousands of degrees. 
These are but a few of the marvels of chem- 
istry, which are fascinating on their own account, 
and are also of tremendous importance to each 
one of us. While primarily addressed to young 
folks, this book has a message to older readers as 
well, .

THE WONDERS OF AIR 
Tr you will go out into the open on a clear 
night and find the North Star and then look 
* around a little you will see the constellation of the 
Big Dipper on one side of it and the constellation 
of Cassiopeia, which is formed like the letter W, 
on the other side of it. Now draw an imaginary 
‘line through the middle of the Big Dipper, the 
North Star and Cassiopeia and let it project be- ~ 
yond the latter when it will pass through a hazy 
patch of light, and this is the Great Nebula of 
Andromeda. 
Where Our Atmosphere Came From.—On 
looking at this nebula through a powerful tele- 
Scope you would instantly see that it is not made 
“up of myriads of stars but of something that 
seéms very much like fog, or vapor, or smoke, 
_with a bright spot in its center and other and 
_smaller bright spots scattered through it here and 
-there, and these have quite a solid appearance. - 
It was from just such a nebula as this that our 
solar system was made, our sun being formed of

the bright central part, and our earth and the 
other planets growing from the smaller bright 
_parts. This nebula contained all of the gases 
and other elements which go to make up the 
earth, together with its envelope of air. 
How-the—AimosphereBehaves.—The atmos- 
phere, as the air surrounding the-earth is called, - 
is often likened to a great ocean, the lower part 
resting on the surface of it just as water does, 
and it stays there for the same reason, and that is 
because it has weight. While a little air has no 
appreciable weight, the atmosphere reaches up- 
ward to a height of from fifty to two hundred 
miles and the amount of it is enough to make it 
_press on the surface of the earth, at sea level, 
with a weight of nearly fifteen pounds to the 
square inch. This pressure is always changing a 
‘little, as some parts of it become heated more than 
others, and in equalizing the temperature the air 
is put into motion, and in this way the winds are 
set up. 
/ é e- Of —While 
you cannot sense the air when it is perfectly still, 
you can feel it when it is moving, that is when a 
breeze, or the wind, is blowing, and you can then 
also hear the effects of it Air is formed chiefly 
of two gases »qarygen,and yitrogenyin the propor- 
tion of one part of the fornier to tur parts of the 
latter. Sc :

THE WONDERS OF AIR 8 
These very unlike gases, however, are merely 
mixed together and not combined chemically; in- 
deed if they were combined they would not form 
air but one of the owides of nitrogen. The Chi- 
nese knew that air contained an active element, 
-which is the oxygen in it, away back in the eighth 
- eentury. They also knew that it would combine 
with sulphur, charcoal and some metals, and how 
to obtain it from saltpetre. The first person, 
however, to show that the air was formed of two 
gases was Leonardo da Vinci, who lived during 
the last half of the fifteenth century. But it was 
away along in the eighteenth century before the 
first pure sample of oxygen was made by Joseph 
Priestley, and this he did by heating mercuric 
Ox He called the gas so obtained dephlogis- 
tiated air, and a few years later the name oxy- 
gen* was given to it by Lavoisier, the greatest 
chemist of his time. 
|_-WNitrogen, the other chief gas of the air, was 
‘discovered by Rutherford, of Edinburgh, a cou- 
1In Priestley’s day (1750) phlogiston was the name given toa 
supposed principle that was thought to be a necessary part of 
every substance which burns. Thus when he heated mercuric 
oxide he assumed that the phlogiston had been separated from 
the gas (oxygen) which remained, and hence he called the latter 
dephlogisticated air. 
2The word oxygen means acid former, and Lavoisier believed 
that oxygen was the one essential constituent needed to form an 
acid. Later it was found-to be hydrogen and not oxygen. It was 
Lavoisier who overthrew the phlogiston theory.
-P-A-G-E-13

ple of years before Priestley found a way to ob- 
tain oxygen. His experiment consisted of shut- 
ting up an animal in an air-tight compartment; 
he then removed the carbon diowide, which was 
given off when the animal breathed, by ab- 
sorbing it with charcoal, when he found that a 
_ gas still remained which would not support 
life. 
But the fact that nitrogen existed in the air as 
a separate gas was first shown byLavoisier. He 
called it azote, which means without life, and the 
French still use this name for it. We get. the 
word nitrogen from the Latin nitrum, which 
means saltpetre. The oxygen of the air, then, is 
the gas that supports and sustains life, and the 
nitrogen simply serves to dilute and spread it 
about, 
l Gi Substances in the Air—Carbon Diox- 
ide.—Here are two easy experiments which you 
should make. First, take a glass of lime water, 
which is a clear and colorless solution, and blow 
through a straw into it when it will become a 
milky white.. Second, light a piece of candle and 
let it down into a bottle which has a little lime 
water in it; you will not, have long to wait until a 
white crust will begin to form on it. These ex- 
periments show very clearly that not only your 
breath and the candle give off some kind ofa gas 
but that the gas in each case is the same. This
-P-A-G-E-14
THE WONDERS OF AIR ~~’ "5 _ 
gas is often called carbonic acid gas, but its right 
is carbon dioxide. o 
re is not very much carbon dioxide in the 
air compared with the oxygen and nitrogen, and it 
varies in different localities. In cities where 
fuels are burned the amount of it is in the neigh- — 
. borhood of six parts to 10,000 parts of air, while 
in the country there are only about three parts in 
10,000 parts of air. The amount is kept pretty 
constant, for while growing vegetation absorbs 
large quantities of it, this is replaced all the time 
by animals which exhale it, burning fuels, decay- 
ing meats and vegetable matter and fermentation 
in wines, and in various other substances. which 
keep giving it off. . 
The choke-damp of the miners is really carbon 
dioxide, and while it is not poisonous it will not 
support life; this is the reason why deaths often 
result when men‘in mines have to breathe too 
much of it. The human body, though, can stand 
a considerable amount of carbon dioxide above 
the usual three or six per cent. without causing 
death or even producing any untoward result, as 
is shown in works where it is made for charging 
mineral and soda waters.

ways found in the air, however dry it may seem 
to be, is water tapor. When you step out of 
doors on a cold day you can see the water

   ONDERS OF CHEMISTRY: 
vapor'that is in your warm breath every time you 
exhale it into the colder air. The amount of 
water vapor that the air can hold depends on the 
temperature of the latter. When the air -con- 
tains as much water vapor as it can hold it is then 
_ said to be saturated, and hot air can be saturated 
with more water vapor than cold air. 
The reason you can see your breath when you 
exhale it into cold air.is because the warm air 
which you exhale is not saturated with water 
vapor, but as your breath strikes the cold air the 
latter is saturated with it, which makes it visible. 
This also explains why moisture collects on a 
tumbler of cold water when it is placed in a warm 
room and frost forms on a window pane when it 
is warm inside and cold outside. Since cold air 
has less power to hold water vapor than warm air . 
as the warm moisture-laden air begins to.cool off 
in the night the water vapor condenses into water _ 
and clings to thé grass and other objects, and this :- 
is what we call dew. é 
When there is a thick fog or it,begins.to rain, it 
is because the atmosphere is saturated with water - 
vapor. The amount of water vapor in the at- 
mosphere determines its humidity; and ‘when the . 
saturation point is nearly reached, that is when 
the humidity is high, the pores of our bodies can- 
not throw off the excess water by evaporation and 
so we feel oppressed. And the reverse is also —
-P-A-G-E-16
Ne eet 
THE WONDERS OF ‘AIR 7 
true, for when there is very little water vapor in 
the air, that is when the humidity is low, we per- 
spire too freely and this, too, is unpleasant. 
Where hot air or steam is used to heat a room it 
tends to dry out the moisture in the air; this can 
‘be compensated for by placing a pan of water on: 
the radiator or near the register so that the evapo- 
ration will make up for that which is lost. 
Duet-ond_-Geems.—The air at all times con- 
tains dust of many varieties and germs of many 
kinds. When you are in a theatre and a spot- 
light is thrown from the gallery onto the stage 
you will see the course of the beam of light, but 
this is only because the light is reflected by the 
dust particles in its path,—for a beam of light it- 
self cannot be seen. 
What we call dust is not made up of particles 
of dry matter alone, but frequently it contains 
millions of germs; that is, minute animals, that are 
alive and kicking and which have the power, 
many of them, to produce disease unless our 
bodies are in such an excellent state of health as 
_—toheable to ward off their attacks) ‘These germs

odor, which is rather due to the cleanness of the 
air, : 
ir—In ~ 
1894, Lord Rayleigh and Sir William Ramsay, 
British scientists of renown, discovered that the 
atmosphere contained traces of a new gas which 
they called grgan<” The way they came to make - 
the discovery was like this: They had obtained 
some nitrogen from the air by removing the 
oxygen, when they found that it was heavier than 
the nitrogen they had made by decomposing an. 
ammonia compound called ammonium nitrite. . 
After many experiments they came to the con- _ 
clusion that there must be some other substance — 
in the air which made the nitrogen heavier than 
that which they obtained from other substances, 
and this they discovered to be a gas. ‘They called 
this gas argon from two Greek words which mean 
inactive, as all attempts thus far to make it com- 
bine with other elements have proved unsuccess- 
ful. a 
Sir William. Ramsay discovered three new. 
gases in the atmosphere in 1898, when it became 
possible to make liquid air on a large scale, and 
these are neon, wenon, and krypton. "Neon,
-P-A-G-E-21

named from the Greek word which means new, 
was separated from the air by letting a quart or 
so of liquid air evaporate. As the lighter gases 
passed off first, the heavier gases, of which neon is 
one, remained at the bottom of the container. It 
"was shown by Ramsay that there is one part of - 
neon in 100,000 parts of air. 
The gas xenon, which means stranger, is an- 
other inactive chemical element that is left after 
the other gases have evaporated from liquid air. 
It is the heaviest of all the gases found in the air. 
Krypton, which means hidden, is another of the 
rare gases which Ramsay discovered in the air, 
and it has a density of about twice that of argon. 
It exists in the proportion of about one part to a 
million parts of air. 
How Air Supports Life—If the air supply 
is cut off from an animal it will quickly die of 
suffocation. As you know, man and all the more 
highly developed animals breathe by means of 
lungs and in doing so they take the oxygen from 
the air. It is the oxygen that supports life and 
after it is received into the lungs it is absorbed by 
the blood and earried to every part of the body... 
Now the cells of animals are made up very 
largely of carbon and hydrogen, and when the 
oxygen in the blood comes in contact with them 
they combine and produce two different com- 
pounds; that is, the oxygen which combines with
-P-A-G-E-22
THE WONDERS OF AIR ” 
the carbon of the cells produces carbon dioxide, 
and the oxygen which combines with the hydro~ 
gen produces water. The carbon dioxide is car- 
ried back by the blood to the lungs of the animal, 
where it is exhaled into the air, while the water is 
carried off by the kidneys, the lungs and the skin, 
Plants breathe as well as animals, but they do 
this through little openings, called stomata, on 
the under sidé of their leaves. But, different 
from animals, plants inhale the carbon dioxide 
that is in the air, and this is where the carbon 
comes from, of which they are so largely formed. - The carbon diaside also combines with some of the water that the roots have absorbed and 
forms sugar, starch and cellulose, which latter is 
the woody fibers of the plant. On combining 
with the water some. oxygen is set free and 
this goes back into the air. From this cycle of 
operations you will see that there is a constant . 
balance maintained between the oxygen that ani- 
mals take out of the air and the plants take in, 
and the carbon dioxide that the plants take out of 
it and the animals exhale. 
. ‘Haperiments With Liquid Air—How Liquid — 
Air is Made.—In 1895, Linde, a Swedish chem- 
ist, discovered a process by which very low tem- - 
peratures could be obtained—temperatures as 
low, nearly, as minus 200 degrees—and this 
method has since been used for the production of
-P-A-G-E-23
12 WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY 
liquid air. This process consists of compressing 
ordinary air and taking the heat out of it by mak- 
ing it flow through pipes immersed in cold water. 
When the compressed air is cool it is allowed to 
escape through a nozzle when the air expands, 
and this again very greatly lowers its tempera- 
ture. ‘ 
The chilled stream of air is next made to flow 
around the pipe which carries the air after it is 
cooled with water and before it escapes through 
the nozzle, and this process is repeated so that 
' each time a lower temperature is had until finally 
-@ point is reached at which the air becomes a 
liquid. This is the process that is now in general 
use for liquefying air and other gases. 
The Apparatus Used.—The apparatus of a 
liquid air plant is generally made up of a two- 
stage air compressor, that is a compressor having 
two cylinders, a low pressure and a high pressure 
one, and this is driven by steam or electric power. 
The air which is to be liquefied has the water 
vapor and carbon dioxide extracted from it when 
‘it is admitted into the first cylinder of the com- 
pressor, where it is compressed to about 200 
pounds to the square inch. : 
The air under this pressure then flows through 
a coil of ‘pipe immersed in cold water, and when it 
is thoroughly cooled it is allowed to flow through 
a small nozzle into the second cylinder of~the
-P-A-G-E-24
THE WONDERS OF AIR’ 18 
compressor, where it is compressed to 2,000 
pounds to the square inch. It is again made to. ~ 
flow through a coil of pipe and is cooled to a still.» 
lower temperature by the air which has previously 
_ been compressed and cooled, and this changes it 
_ “into.a liquid. 
‘About Liquid Air—The liquid air thus pro- 
duced has a pale, sky-blue color, and if allowed to . 
flow out on a plate or into a common bottle it will 
instantly commence to boil, as ordinary air is so 
much hotter than it is, and it will continue to boil 
until all of it has evaporated into the air again. 
How to keep liquid air after having obtained it 
was a great problem to the scientists for a while, 
but Sir James Dewar solved it by inventing a 
bottle with a double wall—a bottle within a bottle 
—and then pumping the air out of the space be- 
tween them. This construction insulates the in- 
side bottle from the outgide one so that it takes a 
long time for the heat of the air outside to pene- 
trate through the vacuym and reach it. This is 
the origin of the th s bottle which is now so 
popular for keeping hot liquids hot and cold 
liquids cold. 
Experiments With Liquid Air—tIf you have a 
quart or so of liquid air you can perform magical 
marvels the like of which the old and honored 
tribe of Hindu fakirs never dreamed. Among 
these is freezing some mercury into the shape of a

  14 WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY _ 
: hammer; when it sets to a solid it looks very. much ~ 
like silver, and you can use it to drive nails. 
' Drop a-hollow rubber ball into a glass of liquid 
air and when. it is frozen it becomes as brittle as 
though it were made of glass; now throw it on the 
floor and it will break into a hundred pieces. A. 
beefsteak when frozen in liquid air will rmg out 
like a gong if you strike it with a hammer, but 
you must not strike it too hard or it will fly to 
pieces. These are just a few of the many start- 
ling experiments that you can make with liquid 
air, and what it may lead to in the future no one.

THE MARVELS OF WATER 
‘W3EN the world was in the making there were. 
terrific lightning storms and these great electrical _- 
_ discharges, together with the heat generated by. _ 
.the mighty upheavals of primordial matter, 
caused the hydrogen and the oxygen to combine - 
chemically as water vapor in the atmosphere.. — 
This vapor finally fell as liquid water and blan-- 
keted the earth and this was the origin of the 
lakes, seas, and rivers. 
What Water Is.—Different from the air, - 
which is. a mere mechanical mixture of its two 
constituent gases, water is formed of free oxygen © 
and free hydrogen in the proportion of one part. _ 
of The Tormer and Bro parte of the latter by vol- 
umié, that is by bulk. ~ Now, these gases will not - 
combine at ordinary temperatures, neither will 
- they burn when ¢ they are hey are combined. This, obvi- 
ously, i is a very wise provision, for so inflammable 
‘is’ each of these gases separately that a mere « 
spark would suffice to ignite them, and so fire the 
whole world. 
‘ When oxygen and hydrogen are merely mixed. :  
-P-A-G-E-29
16 WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY 
together, like the nitrogen and oxygen of the air, 
they are very explosive, and when they explode 
they combine chemically, the resultant product of 
which is the liquid we call water. If a jet of hy- 
drogen is burned in a jet of oxygen they will not 
explode provided the correct proportions of each 
gas are maintained. Under these conditions the 
flame thus produced is, with the exception of the 
electric arc, the hottest that we know how to 
-make. 'To obtain the oxy-hydrogen flame a spe- 
cial nozzle is used, and when the flame is directed 
on a piece of lime it heats it to incandescence and 
this makes a dazzling light. This ory-hydrogen 
light, as it is called, was used for years in stereop- 
ticons and for spot-lights in theatres before the 
electric light displaced it. 
There are two laboratory experiments you c can 
make which prove that ‘water is really formed of 
oxygen and hydrogen.\\One of these is to de- 
compose it with a current of electricity, and the 
other is to combine the two gases by igniting them 
with an electric spark. To decompose water is 
easy, for you need only to invert two test-tubes 
filled with water in a tumbler of water and bring 
one end of one of the wires of an electric battery - 
under and into one test-tube, and the other wire 
from the battery under and into the other. test- 
tube. (See Chapter XIV.)

an electric current, and to make it do. so you must: 
put a few drops of sulphuric acid into it, This ‘ 
-done, switch on the current and you will see a lot 
of little bubbles form on each of the ends of the 
wires, or electrodes, and, presently, you will also 
observe that the water in the upper ends of the 
tubes is falling, and, moreover, that it falls twice 
as fast in one tube as it does in the other. This is 
because the spaces in the tubes are being filled 
with gases which displace the water as it is 
formed and that twice as much hydrogen is being 
formed as oxygen. 
- As these gases have no color you cannot see 
them and so to know they are actually there and 
to tell them apart you must make some kind of a 
test. This you can do by removing the tube, 
closed end up, in which there is the least water 
and holding a lighted match to the mouth of it. 
There will be a miniaturé explosion, which is the 
proof that it contains hydrogen gas and it will 
burn with a flame that is just about the color of 
air. To test the other tube for oxygen, remove 
the tube, closed end up, light a match and blow 
out the flame of it so that only a kindling spark 
remains; push it into the tube when it will in- 
stantly burst into a flamé again, and this proves 
that it contains oxygen. 
Further tests will show that the sulphuric acid 
added to the water to make it a conductor re-

mains after the water has been electrolyzed, as it 
is called. While the above experiment proves 
that oxygen and hydrogen have been separated 
out from the water it does not prove that water 
is formed of them and nothing else. To show 
this conclusively you need a laboratory apparatus 
called a eudiometer; this consists of a graduated 
tube so that two volumes of hydrogen and one 
volume of oxygen can be. passed into it. In the 
upper end of the tube, which is closed, a pair of 
platinum wires is sealed in so that a small spark- 
gap is formed. 
Now as long as the hydrogen and the oxygen 
in the tube are not subjected to heat they will re- 
main merely mixed, but the instant that an elec- 
tric spark is made to jump across the spark-gap 
the two gases will explode and chemically com- 
bine when a minute drop of water will be pro- 
duced. Since it takes more than 2,000 volumes 
of the mixed gases to make one volume of water 
it is easy to see why the resultant amount of the 
latter is so very small.

‘When water boils it is converted into true

When this vapor passes into the colder air it con-

is to take a flask, such as chemists use, partly fill- 
it.with water and heat it over the flame of an alco- 
hal lamp or a Bunsen burner. When it boils you

heated and which are then allowed to cool, con- 
tract; that is they shrink a little. Water, when 
cooled, likewise shrinks until it reaches a tem- 
perature of plus 39 degrees, Fahrenheit, which is 
seven degrees above its freezing-point. Water is 
then the heavier. As the temperature falls from 
39° to 32° it expands, and the colder water 
(82°) is at the top of the vessel, as it begins to 
solidify, that is, to change into ice. 
Since the density of ice is less than water it 
weighs proportionately less, and this is the reason 
why ice forms on the surface of water as well-as 
floats on top of it. If water continued to shrink 
as it became ice it would sink and choke up the 
waterways and besides it might never melt. The 
mighty force set up by water when it begins to ~ 
freeze is a phenomenon that you are probably 
well acquainted with, for it is then that it bursts: 
water-pipes, cracks milk bottles and plays havoc 
in general. At the end of this chapter we shall 
tell you how artificial ice is manufactured. ; 
Kinds and Uses of Water.—Thereis, of course, 
only one kind of water chemically, but physically 
there are many different kinds depending on 
whether it is impure or pure, that is, contains 
foreign substances or not. ~“Pure-water, as you 
have seen, consists of hydrogen and oxygen and 
contains nothing elseggnd this may be obtained in

water is, generally Speaking, as fy2e from iapark 
ties as is ever found in nature, but as it always 
contains other substances, it cannot be really 
called pure. Well and spring water that look so 
clear and sparkling contain mineral supstances of 
various kinds, while surface water fairly teems 
with germs, some of which are harmless, while 
others produce virulent diseases. 
Water is the natural drink of man, but as he 
grew in curiosity and knowledge he experi- 
mented with its effect on other substances and so 
found among other things, that certain herbs, 
fruit and grains when steeped, boiled and dis- 
tilled with water produced drinks that were 
pleasing to the taste and stimulating to the sys- 
tem. Water, however, is necessary to the well- 
being of all living things, since they themselves, 
whether plants or animals, are formed of three- 
fourths part of it. Hence the matter of provid- 
ing a supply that is free from harmful substances 
is a vital one to the human race. 
And this is also true in the arts and industries, 
for many kinds of water contain substances 
which make them unsuitable for certain pur- 
poses and, what is more to the point, they are 
actually injurious, as you will presently see. 
About Drinking Water—Drinking water, or 
potable water as it is called, plays a large part in 
determining the state of the health, and, conse- oan «

quently, it is important that it should be of the 
right kind. Now, as already stated, water from 
springs and deep wells is generally free from 
germs, but it always contains more or less mineral 
matter. As the water soaks through the soil the 
germs in it become attached to the particles.of 
the latter and are not carried down with it; on the 
other hand, as the water comes in contact with the 
minerals of the soil it dissolves some of them and 
carries them along in solution. 
If a well is dug, a pump is driven, or the 
stream finds its way to the surface, as a spring, 
the water will be pure and wholesome because the 
disease germs have been filtered out of it. Should 
the underground stream reach the sea, it carries - 
the mineral substances with it, and when the sea 
water evaporates, only pure water goes up and. _ 
- this comes down again as rain. 
‘You can easily find out the amount of foreign 
matter there is in any kind of water, for all you 
need to do is to fill a porcelain dish with some of 
it and heat it over an alcohol, or a Bunsen, flame 
until it-has all evaporated, when the solid matter 
-will remain behind. Where the water seeps 
through soil containing granite rock very little of 
the latter will be dissolved away, but where the 
water comes in cofitact with limestone large 
amounts of the latter will be dissolved.

‘kinds of water that contain vei ry. little mi mineral 
water than contains limestone and other mineral 
substances is called hard water. As a matter of 
fact, water of any kind th that contains enough 
mineral matter to make soap curdle is hard 
water. Where there are more than twenty-five 
parts of mineral matter in a million parts of 
water it does not affect it to the extent of making 
_ it hard, but where there are more than fifty parts- 
of mineral matter in a million parts of water it * 
makes it quite hard, 
There are two kinds of hard water, and these 
are: (1) temporary hard water, and (2) perma- 
nent hard water. The difference between them 
is that you can get rid of the hardness of the first: 
kind by boiling it, since it contains limestone, and 
this is precipitated, that is, it is thrown down, 
"and deposited on the inside of the kettle. But 
boiling will not remove the hardness. of the sec- 
ond kind for the reason thet it contains gypsum, 
or, rather, calcium sulphate, which cannot be 
precipitated in this way. You can, however, 
soften permanent hard water to some extent by 
adding sal soda to it, as this tends to precipitate 
the.gypsum when sodium sulphate is left in 
solution. ¥ 
‘How Soap Acts on Water.—When you put 
soap into soft water it makes it lather or suds, be~

cause there is little or no mineral matter in it. 
~ But when you put soap into hard water it com- 
bines with the mineral substances chemically and 
forms a compound that cannot be dissolved. . If, 
- however, you precipitate the limestone that is in 
hard water by boiling, or the gypsum by adding 
sal soda to it as described above, the soap and 
water will then lather or suds freely. 
‘Where hard water is the only kind available 
for use in the home it becomes quite an item of 
expense’ for it wastes the soap in proportion to 
its hardness. Not only this, but where it is very 
hard, the mineral substances get into the pores of — 
the skin and the soap will have very little 
effect in getting them out. So, too, they lodge 
between the meshes of goods that. are washed 
and in the same way and for the same reason 
it ‘is quite impossible to get them clean. 
Nearly all laundry soaps pfid washing powders 
ave ati excess of soda in them to soften hard 
water and this has a very bad effect on the goods. 
Boiler Water and Boiler Scale—tIf you will- 
look, into a teakettle you will see, if you use well 
water in it, that the inside of it is incrusted, or has 
fur on. it, as it is sometimes called. This is, of 
course, the precipitate of the mineral. matter 
caused by boiling the water. Where hard water 
is used for running engines and steam plants the 
same action takes place, though on a larger scale
-P-A-G-E-38
THE MARVELS OF WATER 25 
and with a more destructive effect. That is.to 
say, the inside of the boiler and tubes becomes 
coated with the mineral matter and this prevents 
the heat from passing through them and wastes 
the coal, There are other disadvantages in using - 
hard water in boilers, and among them are: 
(1) the boiler scale and boiler plate, of which 
" the boiler is made, expand at different rates and 
this often leads to weakening the seams; (2) 
the scale may cause the tubes to get red-hot and 
this not only shortens the life of the boiler but 
may cause it to explode; (8) it pits the tubes of 
the boiler, and (4) it causes the water to foam. 
The easiest and cheapest method of keeping a 
boiler from scaling and pitting and the water 
from foaming is to use soft water, but this is not 
always practical. The next best thing is to get 
rid of the hardness of the water if hard water 
must be used. If the hardness is temporary the 
water can be boiled before it is used in the boiler 
or it can be treated by adding milk of lime which 
is made by stirring slaked lime in water. 
- To soften boiler water whose hardness is per- 
manent, soda ash is added to it, but the amount 
used must be according to the amount of mineral 
matter there is in it. Where boiler water has 
both limestone and gypsum in it so that it has 
both temporary and permanent hardness, both 
can be removed by, adding a solution of crude

caustic soda to it. What is called the permutit 
process is also widely used for softening boiler 
water. Permutit is a coarse kind of sand, and 
when the water to be used is filtered through it 
the mineral substances react with the sand, and 
the sodium, which is in the sand, replaces the 
calcium in the water. The sodium compound 
goes into the boiler with the water but has no 
action except to clean it. 
Purifying Water on a Big Scale—To provide 
water in sufficient quantities to supply cities 
has been one of the great problems of civilized 
mankind, but it is only during the last fifty years 
or so that the necessity for purifying water for 
drinking purposes has been. fully taken into ac- 
count. Now there are several ways by which. 
water can be purified and among the more im: 
portant are by: (1) boiling;~(2) aeration, 
(3) chemical processes, (4) the ozone process, 
(5) biological processes, (6) the coagulation 
method, and (7) mechanical separation. 
For purifying water on a small scale, as for 
home use, boiling is the simplest and best method. 
But for purifying water on a large scale the last- 
named six methods given above are employed 
either separately or in cqmbination. Aerating 
the water is done either by. throwing it into the: 
air or else letting it fall over a steep hill of rocks. 
In either case when the water comes into contact

with the air some of the oxygen of the latter is — 
dissolved out of it. While this treatment im- 
proves the water it does not purify it to any great 
extent. 
One of the chemical processes consists of add- 
ing bleaching powder to the water, when chlorine 
is liberated and this gas kills off all the harmful 
germs. Ozone, which is a vigorous form of oxy- 
‘gen, is produced by electric discharges in the air: 
and this when introduced into the water also kills 
off the germs. Ozone is far better than chlorine. 
_ for this purpose, as an excess of the former in | 
the water cannot be detected, whereas any excess 
of the latter gives the water a bad taste. The 
most curious of all methods for purifying water 
-is that of putting germs\that are harmless to the 
human system into the water and these kill off 
the harmful gerpp. This is known 4 as a biolog- 
ical process. 
Another curious way of ridding water. of 
germs is by the coagulation proce In. this 
process a harmless glue-like substance is put into 
the water, and the germs and other impurities 
stick to it. The mass is then separated out from 
the water when the latter is left comparatively 
pure.. In the sedimentation method much of the. 
impurities, including the germs, falls to the bot- 
tom, but it does not get rid of all of them. Usu- 
ally..after sedimentation the water is passed -

. through mechanical or sand filters which remove 
the rest of the germs and other impurities. 
How Artificial Ice ig Made—Making Ice 
With Ammonia——Ammonia is one of the easi- 
est gases to liquef¥, and this property is taken 
advantage of in making artificial ice. To liquefy 
ammonia gas all that is necessary is to compress 
it, causing it to liberate heat. Then, when 
,the pressure is removed, the liquefied ammonia 
expands into a gas again and as it does so it 
absorbs a large amount of heat. In this latter 
operation the heat which it absorbs is taken from 
water which surrounds the ammonia pipes and 
this produces a freezing temperature. 
_, The apparatus used for the manufacture of ice 
by the ammonia process consists of a compressor 
driven by an engine or other source of power, a 
water-cooled series of pipes, and a cooling-tank. 
Ammonia gas is passed into the compression cyl- 
inder where it is compressed and liquefied, then it 
is passed through a series of pipes on which cold 
water drips. 
It-is next allowed to expand into a gas, and as 
it does so it flows through another series of pipes - 
immersed in a tank of brine, that is a solution of 
- salt and water, which will not freeze at the tem- 
perature of ordinary water. As the ammonia 
flows through these pipes it absorbs the heat of 
the brine until the temperature of the latter
-P-A-G-E-42
THE MARVELS OF WATER 29 
drops to below plus 82 degrees Fahrenheit, which 
is the freezing-point of ordinary water. Sheet- . 
steel cans filled with distilled water are immersed 
in the brine, and thus the water in them is frozen.

FIRE, HEAT AND FUEL 
To make and to use fire belongs to mankind 
alone. None of the animals, not even the man- 
like apes, such as the gibbon, orang and chim- 
panzee,. know how to use fire, much less how to 
make it. But when the first man was evolved, 
something like a.million years ago, his first real. 
exploit that set him above the monkey family 
was to use fire. Then, with the coming of. mod-. 
ern man, or Homo-sapiens (which means man~ 
wise), came the knowledge of how to make a fire - 
when. and where he wanted it. 
Origin of Ways of Making Fire.—It is easy 
to guess that before primitive man had learned_+ 
how to make fire for himself he obtained it from 
‘the bet ashes or lava, that was thrown out, or 
flowed down, into a valley from some volcano, or 
that he found a tree ablaze which the lightning: 
. had ‘struck, or the dried grass burning where a 
meteor had fallen. As to the method he first 
euploved. to make a fire it seems reason ly cer-

The concussion method, as the first is called, 
was carried on through the ages, with the slight 
modification of using a piece of-stéel in the place 
of one of the rocks, until the middle of the last 
century me matches came into general use. 
as far a the fifteenth century. Robert 
Boyle,-who was one of the first of the real chem- 
ists, discovered, in 1680, how to obtain phos- 
phorus, and under his direction Godfrey Hawk-_ / 
witz made a match by dipping a wood splint in 
“Gilphur and then securing a bit of phosphorus 
to it, 
The reason phosphorus is used is because 
it ignites at a very low temperature; in fact, yel- 
low phosphorus will take fire when it is exposed 
to air, while red phosphorus must be heated a 
trifle before it will do so, and a little friction is 
all that is needed. Owing to the danger and 
trouble of using the: phosphorus, which was evi- 
dently of the yellow kind, and also to its high 
_ cost, the match did not come into general use un- 
til more than one hundred and fifty years later. 
What Fire and Flame Are-—When a sub- 
stance combines violently with oxygen, which the 
air supplies in unlimited quantities, both heat and 
light are produced,{and we say a ce 
is burning while we call thé phenomenon fire. 
‘The act or operation of something burning is
-P-A-G-E-45
TONDERS OF CHEMISTRY — 
caucy, combustion, but burning and combustion 
are words that are generally used to mean. the 
same thing. Many substances which burn contain 
hydrogen and other gases, and when these are 
ignited they stream forth into the air and pro- 
duce light. In nearly all kinds of flame the light 
is set up by solid particles formed chiefly of car- 
bon suspended in the gas and heated to incandes- 
cence—that is white hot. 
Burning and the Kindling Point.—Before 
you can make a piece of paper or wood burn 
you must heat it, and until you have heated it to 
a certain degree of temperature it will not take 
fire. The lowest temperature at which paper, 
wood, or any other substance will ignite is called 
- its kindling point, or kindling temperature, and 
this differs -with different substances. That dif- 
ferent substances have different kindling points 
is taken advantage of in making parlor matches; 
that is one end of the splint is dipped into melted 
paraffin and this is coated with a compound of 
phosphorus and chlorate of potassium. 
‘Now when you strike the match the heat de- 
veloped by the friction fires the phosphorus and 
frees the oxygen of the chlorate of potassium 
and in burning this heats the paraffin until its 
kindling point is reached and it takes fire; this 
‘in turn heats the wood splint until its kindling 
point is reached when it finally takes fire. That
-P-A-G-E-46
FIRE, HEAT. AND FUEL 88 
a substance must have its temperature-raised to 
the kindling point before it can ignite is a. wise 
’ precaution of nature, for if it did not prevail, the... 
moment any kind of combustible material came 
into contact with oxygen it would take fire. 
Bear in mind that the kindling point of a sub- 
stance is the lowest temperature at which it will 
ignite and that it has nothing to do with. the 
temperature set up by the substance when it. is 
burning. 
When Things Burn i in Air—tTo make a sub- 
stance burn, you must have plenty of oxygen 
present and raise the temperature of the sub- 
stance to the kindling point. The oxygen that is 
in the air furnishes enough of this gas for all 
ordinary burning purposes and most materials 
that burn, especially those we use for fuel, 
are composed chiefly of carbon, hydrogen and 
such substances as will combine readily with 
oxygen when they are raised to the kindling 
point. / 
Temperatures that are very much higher than 
those when ordinary substances burn can be had 
by burning aluminum in oxygen which is set free 
from: some of the oxides of metals such as ferric 
owide, that is iron rust. The great affinity of 
aluminum for oxygen when it is fired makes-it 
burn at a temperature high enough to melt any 
of the metals. This forms the basis of welding  
-P-A-G-E-47
84 WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY. 
and producing pure metals known as the Gold- 
schmidt thermit process’ and you will find more 
about it in the chapter on metals. 
How to Start and Put Out a Fire-—To start 
a fire easily you must have an excess of oxygen 
and this is the reason why you use paper or shav- 
ings first, and kindling wood next before you put 
on the wood or coal. This is also why you fan 
the fire with your hat, blow on it with your 
mouth or, better, with a bellows blower. To keep 
the fuel burning after it takes fire there must be 
sufficient oxygen and hydrogen to combine fast 
enough to keep the temperature higher than the 
kindling point, and. to.set free the products of 
_eombustion. , 
The way to put out a fire is just the reverse 
of kindling and keeping it going. Where a fire 
has just started, a quick way to put it out is to 
smother it with a blanket as this keeps. the 
oxygen away from it and the carbon dioxide 
around it. Where a building is burning water 
__ is thrown on it, as this takes up much of the heat 
_ by absorbing it, keeps the temperature below its 
’ kindling point, while the steam that is formed — 
. prevents the air from supplying more oxygen to 
it. Fire extinguishers are made so that when 
_they are opened they will generate carbon di- 
oxide, or some other vapor that will not burn. 
or support combustion, and the pressure of these

_gases throws a stream of water on the blazing 
material. 
About Spontaneous Combustion. — When 
oxygen combines with other substances. whose. - 
temperature has been raised above the kindling 
point it oxidizes them and they either decay or 
. rust.. The chemical action is quite like burning 
‘but, of course, there is very little heat developed 
and usually no light is produced. When oxygen 
 eombines: with some substances, as for instance 
linseed oil in which wool is soaked the heat de- 
veloped may not be released; if it is kept in by. 
the wool until it becomes hot enough to raise the 
temperature to the kindling point, the material 
takes fireand this is called spontaneous combus- tion.” a 
» Heat is a Form of Energy —Heat is a form of 
energy and not a form of matter as it was once 
thor aght to be. Heat can be produced in dif- 
_. ferent ways, as for instance by friction, by pass- 
- Inga current through a wire which has resistance, 
and by chemical action. The latter method is the 
one that we aré interested in here as a means of 
producing heat. Now all substances of what- 
ever kind are made up of little particles of mat- 
: illed atoms, and when a substance is burning,’ | 
. the ‘action of the carbon and hydrogen atoms in 
coniibiriing with the oxygen gives rise to vibrations 
. in the ether which permeates and surrounds all 
   
-P-A-G-E-49
  86 WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY 
matter: It is by these vibrations in the ether that’ 
the light and heat are transmitted from the burn- 
ing body. If the vibrations of the ether come 
into contact with your body they act on the 
thermal nerves of it and in this way you get the 
sensation of heat. 
Heat as a Power Producer. —There are dif- 
ferent ways by which power can be produced as, 
for instance, by using the wind, the water and 
heat. Heat is the most dependable and_casiest 
controlled sourdé 6 power, and it has the great 
ad f being available at any place any 
time where there SHEL we att produc power, fuel is either burned under a boiler and 
the steam generated in the latter is then made to 
drive the piston of an engine, or it is burned di- 
rectly in the cylinder of an engine and so drives - 
the. piston. 
In either case the reciprocating motion of the 
piston thus obtained is converted into rotary mo- 
- tion by means of the crankshaft; the power thus 
_ developed is easily converted into other powers 
as, for instance, hydraulic pressure, compressed 
air, and electricity. From this you will see that 
. by combining two or more substances.by burning 
them the chemical energy can be released to fur- 
nish power.

This thermometer shows a variation from 
10,000 degrees of heat to absolute zero, 461 
degrees below our Fahrenheit zero, This is over 
$00 degrees below the point where mercury

‘about 98 degrees Fahrenheit and if the object. 
that you say is warm or hot is heated more than ~ 
your body, it gives heat to you until the tempera-. 
tures are the same, If the object feels cool or. 
. cold, then the heat of your body is imparted to it 
until the heat of both is equalized. This extent 
of the heat of objects and things in general is 
called its temperature and it is measured in de- 
grees. : 
To Measure Temperature. —The degree of 
heat of a body, that is the temperature of it, is 
measured by that familiar little instrument called 
a thermometer. ‘This device consists of a glass 
tube having a very small bore and with a bulk 
on-its lower end. The bulb is then filled with: 
mércury and the upper end of the tube is sealed 
off... The tube is mounted on a scale having the 
degrees marked on it. Now mercury is a metal

it expands when it is heated and contracts when — 
itis ‘cooled, hence it rises and falls in the tube as 
the temperature of the air, or whatever it is in 
” contact with, changes. 
way the scale of a thermometer is marked’ 
degrees so that it will show the difference    
-P-A-G-E-53

of temperature accurately, and hence measure it, 
is by placing the thermometer in melting ice and 
then marking off the point where the mercury 
has fallen in the tube, and this is the freezing 
point. This done, it is placed in boiling water 
and the point marked off where the mercury has 
risen in the tube, and this is the boiling point. 
The scale between these two points is divided into 
an equal number of spaces and a few like spaces 
are marked off above and below the freezing and 
boiling points. 
Two kinds of thermometer scales are in gen- 
eral use in the United States, namely the Centi- 
grade scale and the Fahrenheit scale. The freez- 
ing point on a Centrigrade scale is marked 0 and 
the boiling point 100 and the scale in between is 
divided into 100 equal spaces. This thermometer 
is used for scientific work. The freezing point 
of a Fahrenheit scale is marked 32, and the boil- 
ing point 212, hence the scale is divided into 180 
~ equal parts, This thermometer is in use for 
domestic purposes generally, among English- 
speaking peoples. 
The Chemistry of Fuel. —Substances of any 
kind which will, burn and thus develop heat can 
be used for fuels. A substance that makes a 
good fuel is one whose constituents will com- 
bine easily with the oxygen of the air, gives off 
a large amount of heat, and is so plentiful that it
-P-A-G-E-54
° FIRE, HEAT AND FUEL 89 
is cheap. The best fuels are fs which ‘are 
formed chiefly of carbon a and. ‘ogen, tor when 
these “combine with the * aevmen of the air they 
develop large amounts of heat and leave little or 
no ash behind. 
‘When hydro-carbons, as fuels which contain 
carbon and hydrogen are called, burn they give 
off water vapor and carbon dioxide. Ifthe 
burning process is not perfect then some. of the 
carbon will pass off into the air and it is this 
visible product that we call smoke. Other for- 
eign substances in fuels such as particles of rock 
and other minerals are left behind in the form of 
ashes. / 
And now let us find out what happens. when 
fuel burns. In the first place, the hydrogen in it 
is set. free and when this burns it makes a flame, 
or blaze. Then the carbon is heated to incandes- 
cence and combines with the oxygen of the air to 
make carbon dioxide which also passes off into 
the air. “When a fire burns there is nothing 
wasted’so far as nature is concerned, for the 
weight, of the gases given off and the ashes that 
-remain. exactly equal that of "the Tucl used, plus 
the,oxygen absorbed fromthe air. ———e 
Kinds and Qualities of Fuels—Solid Fuels. 
There are many kinds of fuels but all of them 
maybe classified under three general heads, 
namely those that are solid, those that are liquid 
 
-P-A-G-E-55
   "40 WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY 
and _those that are gaseous. Wood, peat and 
coal are the chief solid fuels, petroleum and alco- 
hol are the most widely used liquid fuels, while 
natural and manufactured gases are the chief 
gaseous fuels. 
Wood was the first substance used for fuel 
and it furnished the only source of heat--for 
mankind throughout the ages until some two 
centuries ago. Then came.the discovery of coal 
_ and later petroleum. Wood-for fuel is obtained 
by cutting down trees, but before it is. used ‘it 
‘must be seasoned, that is it must be ‘split and 
_ piled up so that the water in it will dry out. 
“Wood consists largely of cellulose, (see Chapter 
_ on Paper Making) a substance made up of 
_ carbon, hydrogen and‘oxygen. Hard wood is 
preferable to soft wood for fuel, for the harder it . 
is the longer it lasts. 
Wood charcoal - is simply charred wood. 
There are two ways of making it. In the older 
way cordwocd is built up in a conical pile which 
     
   
_.. is then covered with a layer of dirt. Some small’ 
holes are made through the layer at the bottom 
and a large hole is made through the top so that 
enough oxygen will be supplied to the wood to 
drive out the water, gases, alcohol, and acetic acid 
in it, but not enough to make the carbon combine, 
and, hence, nearly pure carbon in the form of 
charcoal remains. A more recent method of

iron retort without any air whatever, . and in this . 
way the alcohol and other products of the wood | 
can be saved, 
Peat is a kind of fuel that we who live i in the, 
United States know little about, but in Ireland. 
and some other European countries it is. used’ 
extensively. Peat is partly decayed vegetable 
matter so that it is neither wood nor coal. It is 
composed chiefly of moss which when it dies. 
furnishes a bed for a new growth. As these 
various growths die they form a thick layer and 
this then breaks up under the action of the Water, 
that covers it into loose particles. Before it can 
be used for fuel it is cut out of the peat bog and 
-laid in the sun to dry out. It then has somewhat 
- the ‘appearance of coal but different from. the 
latter, nearly one-third of it is oxygen. It also 
" contains a great deal of mineral matter which of 
course remains behind as ashes. 
When the world was! young, that is to say in 
the carboniferous period, extensive areas were 
covered with swamps, the air was heavy and 
_the temperature was tropical. This climatic con- 
dition caused ferns to grow in size as large as our 
--day trees and as they died they were 
      
   believed to have been about eighteen million years ago, 
ere were. great swamps and fern forests and the first

covered with water and underwent a process of 
partial deoxidation, or removal of oxygen. Then 
the great storms covered them over with soil and 
rock, and the pressure forced the gases out of 
them and left more or less pure carbon, or coal. 
There are two kinds of coal in use: bituminous, 
or soft coal, and anthracite, or hard coal. The 
difference between them is that bituminous coal 
contains a great deal of gas and many other - 
substances including tar, and about whose mar- 
vels we shall tell you later. 
Anthracite coal is formed chiefly of carbon, 
because the pressure of the soil on it was suf- 
ficiently great to force out the gases and other 
matter, leaving practically pure carbon behind, 
hence it burns with little flame. By enclosing 
bituminous coal in a closed retort and heating it 
coke results, just as charcoal results when wood 
is distilled in a retort. Also the various by- 
products can be recovered from it including the 
valuable coal tar which was once thought to be 
worthless and was thrown away. 
Liquid .Fuels—Of the liquid fuels crude 
petrolewm and alcohol are the most widely used. 
Crude petroleum, so called from the Lati words 
petra which means rock and olewm which means 
oil, is a thick, black oil from which fuel and other 
oils and, products are obtained. It was first dis- 
covered in Pennsylvania but it has since been 
4

FIRE, HEAT AND FUEL 48. 
found in nearly every country on the globe. It 
is held in pockets in what is called oil bearing | 
sandstones, hence the name petroleum, or rock- 
oil, and in conglomerates known as oil sands. 
These oil pockets, or pools, are usually at con- 
siderable depths from the surface of the earth 
and ‘to reach them wells are drilled through the 
intervening strata of earth. To separate the 
various oils from the crude petroleum it must be 
distilled, or refined, as it is called, and instead of 
doing this at the oil fields it is done at other 
places. Thus the petroleum obtained in the oil 
regions of Oklahoma is pumped through a pipe 
line to refineries in New Jersey. 
At these refineries there are great stills and 
into these the crude petroleum is put, and heated. 
As each of the various oils in the petroleum has - 
a different boiling point they pass off in vapors 
at different temperatures. This is what is called 
fractional distillation. In this way, then, the 
gasoline, benzine and kerosene, which are light 
oils ‘are produced. Then there are the heavier 
oils used for lubricating, vaseline, and paraffin, 
while at the bottom of the still after the run is 
made a very hard cake remains. 
'. Alcohol for fuel is made by fermenting grains, 
or other starchy materials, and molasses and 
sawdust. It is largely formed of hydrogen, 
hence.burns with a colorless flame which is free

44 WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY. 
from soot and has a high heat value. It makes 
an exceedingly convenient fuel where a small, 
hot flame is needed and it is sufficiently explosive 
to use in internal combustion engines. 
Gaseous fuels may be either natural or manu- 
factured. Natural gas, like petroleum with 
which it is usually associated, is found in. air- 
tight pockets in various localities. It is always 
under pressure and by drilling wells it issues 
forth in a stream. In the districts where it is 
found it is used exclusively as a fuel, for it is at 
“ once cheap and has a high fuel value. Tlluminat- 
ing gas is made either by heating soft coal in 
closed retorts when it is called coal gas, or by 
forcing a stream of steam over the coal after it 
has been heated to incandescence, when it is 
called water gas.

SOME USEFUL ACIDS 
Ir you ask the average person what an acid is 
he will more than likely tell you that it is a liquid 
with 4 sour taste, which will eat away. metals 
and burn the skin. Now while all ] acids are sour, 
they are not a all Mn Kiquids unt until, | they they are disolved io 
  : aes a part, or ‘all of which, can be ex- 
changed for a metal. Nearly all acids contain 
eeygen as well as hydrogen and these two gases are_combined with a third element. For in-, 
stance, when hydrogen and oxygen and sulphur 
are combined we have the familiar sulphuric acid, 
How Acids Behave—Ié you will turn back to 
the ‘second chapter you will notice that it says 
that..water, which is hydrogen and owygen 
combined, stands at the head of the class of sol- 
vents; that is to say, water will dissolve more sub- 
stances. than any other known liquid. It may 
surprise you a little to learn that water will 
even dissolve some of the lighter metals. But 
when it comes to the heavier metals such as iron 
465
-P-A-G-E-63
46 WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY | 
and copper, silver and gold it takes'a strong acid 
to dissolve them. 
Why Acids Were So Named.—Whenever you 
find two or more things that have the same-sur- 
name you can take it for granted that they are 
alike in some particular respect. For instance 
a fox-terrier and a bulldog do not look any more 
alike than a cat and a rabbit, but the former have 
anatomical points in common, so they are both 
called by the generic name of dog. This scheme 
also holds good for acids, and all acids, whether. 
they axe. gaseous, liquids or solids, resemble all 
ather acids in. somespecific way. - 
After oxygen was discovered it was believed 
by the early ‘chemists that all acids must contain 
this gas. As the word oxygen means acid former 
all substances that. contained oxygen if they 
would turn blue litmus paper red (this is a sim- 
ple test for an acid) were called acids. Later on 
chemists found that all acids did not contain 
oxygen, as, for instance, hydrochloric acid, which 
‘is formed of hydrogen and chlorine. This is a 
gas and to use it, it is dissolved in water. 
On the other hand, sulphuric acid is formed of 
hydrogen, sulphur and. oxygen, while nitric acid 
is formed of hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, 
From this you will see that while these three acids 
eontain hydrogen only two of them contain 
oxygen. So after all, hydrogen is the real acid”
-P-A-G-E-64
SOME USEFUL ACIDS ay 
former; and hence, it follows thatif a substance 
has no hydrogen it is not an acid, However, be- 
fore an acid becomes active enough to “dissolve 
metals and some other substances it must itself be 
dissolved in water. 
Three Useful Acids —-There are numerous 
acids but there are three common ones which are 
used in enormous quantities and for a large 
variety of purposes. These are sylphuric acid, 
hydroshloric acid and nitric acid. Between four 
. and five million tons of sulphurie acid are made 
every year, while over one hundred thousand tons 
of nitric acid are made annually, and the amount 
of hydrochloric acid does not fall far short of the 
nitric acid output. So these are useful acids to 
know about. 
About Sulphuric Acid—To know about sul- 
phuric acid we must start at the beginning and 
that-is with sulphur. This element is found in 
‘nature mixed with earth and rock, arid to get it 
in a-pure condition the matter with which it is 
mixed is heated, when the sulphur melts and flows 
off as-a liquid. On cooling, the crude sulphur is 
refined by distilling it when it again liquefies and - 
‘is run into molds. This gives it the form of a 
roll and this is the roll sulphur we buy in the 
drag store. 
“Now. sulphur will combine with the various 
inetals i in-very much the same way that oxygen 
 
-P-A-G-E-65
48 WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY 
does. When it combines with copper a ‘new 
and very different substance results which is 
called copper sulphide. When copper sulphide 
is burned the sulphur of it combines with oxygen 
and makes a gas known as sulphur diowide and 
this is formed of equal parts of sulphur and 
oxygen; the solid part that remains behind is 
copper owide. 
To make the sulphur dioxide take on more ~ 
oxygen it is passed through a tube containing 
powdered platinum and this is heated to about 
800° Fahrenheit. This catalytic agent makes 
the sulphur dioxide take on an additional 
atom ,f oxygen when the compound becomes 
sulphur trioajde which is a liquid and this is the 
_basis of uric acid. T'o make sulphuric acid, 
all that.is needed is to pour the sulphur trioxide 
into some water. As sulphur trioxide and water 
have a great affinity for each other, the instant 
_ they come in contact the resulting solution, which 
is sulphurie acid, fumes and sputters as though 
a, piece of red-hot iron had been.dropped into it. 
Just a word now about the catalytic agent. 
When the sulphur dioxide is passed over the 
heated platinum the latter does not combine in. 
any way with it but simply helps the oxygen 
which is supplied by admitting air to the tube 
to unite with the sulphur dioxide. To such sub- 
stances as help along the chemical action of other
-P-A-G-E-66
SOME USEFUL ACIDS ~~ 49 
substances but which do not themselves enter into 
combination with them, the word catalizer, or 
term catalytic agent, has been given. 
. Some Properties of Sulphuric Acid—Pure 
sulphuric acid is an oil-like liquid and it is often 
called oil of vitriol because it was made by the, 
early chemists of green vitriol as they termed 
sulphate of iron. It is nearly twice as heavy as 
water with which it combines vigorously in all 
proportions, In mixing them always pour the 
acid into the water, a little at a time, and stir 
constantly. When the water is poured into 
the acid heat in large quantities is generated and 
if they are being mixed in a bottle an explosion 
- may take place. Because it has a-high boiling 
point it is largely used in making various other 
kinds of acids. 
Sulphuric acid agts chemically on most metals, 
particularly zinc’ It chars paper, wood and 
other substances, by dehydrating them, that is 
drying them out by extracting the hydrogen and 
oxygen in them which would combine to form 
water. It is this dehydrating action of sulphuric 
‘acid that makes it so very hard to heal burns 
caused by it. On the other hand, owing to its 
dehydrating action it is used extensively in vari- 
ous manufacturing processes. 
~Uses of Sulphuric Acid.—In the beginning of 
this chapter we mentioned that gver four million
-P-A-G-E-67
‘50 WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY 
tons of sulphuric acid are made and used in the 
United States and it keeps between one hundred 
and fifty and two hundred plants busy turning 
- ont this amount. Of this tremendous output the 
ose goes into the e_ manufacture of 
fertilizers, and the second largest | amount is used 
in refining: petroleum. “Then comes a long “Fine   
way or. another, such as making aluminum sul- 
phate. and other sulphates, and in converting 
‘various substances into high explosives. Indeed, . 
nearly every chemical process, however important 
or insignificant, uses sulphuric acid or some 
chemical which was made with sulphuric acid. — 
About Hydrochloric Acid.—In the early days 
hydrochloric acid was made from the brine of the 
sea and it was called muriatic acid,\4 name that 
‘artisans still prefer to call it. You can make : 
little hydrochloric acid by putting a tablespoon. 
“ful .of common table salt, which is sodiwn: 
chloride, into-a. test tube ‘and filling the latter 
half-full of water. Next pour a little concen- 
trated sulphuric acid into the test tube a drop at 
a time when it will fall to the bottom and come 
in contact with the salt. Very soon bubbles of 
gas will be formed. Let this action go on until 
it stops. Now fill the test tube up with water 
and you will then have; a small quantity of 
hydrochloric acid. /
-P-A-G-E-68
SOME USEFUL ACIDS" 51 
This is the chemical action in the above 
- experiment: When you poured the ‘sulphuric 
acid. on the table salt, or sodium chloride, it re- 
acted on it and formed sodium sulphate’ and at. 
the same time hydrogen chloride gas was given’ 
off, Five hundred volumes of this gas will dis- 
solve in one volume of water, so instead of escap- 
ing it-is dissolved by the water and the resulting 
solution is hydrochloric acid. 
Some Properties of Hydrochloric Acid.— 
When you buy chemically pure hydrochloric acid . 
you get a solution that contains about forty per 
cent of hydrogen chloride gas dissolved in about 
. sixty per cent of water. Hydrachloric acid that 
is sold for ordinagy purposes contains various 
kinds of impurities and this gives it a dingy 
color; this kind is known ds commercial hydro- 
ehloric acid, or muriatic acid. 
While hydrochloric acid by itself will not dis- 
“solve gold or platinum and while it reacts on 
silver, copper, lead and mercury only feebly, it 
attaeks zine violently. With nitric acid it makes 
the aqua-regia of old, or royal water, so called 
because it dissolves gold, the “king of metals.” 
Curiously enough, while hydrochloric acid is a 
valientustri juice, which is the chief digestive 
fluid’ of: the stomach, is formed of a solution 
of very dilute hydrochloric acid, lactic. acid and 
pepsin.
-P-A-G-E-69
  52 WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY. 
Uses of Hydrochloric Acid.—This acid is used 
ig_enormous amounts for making chlorine and 
of the latter gas bleaching compounds are made. 
It is also largely used for pickling iron prepdra- 
tory to tinning it, and for making glue and ‘gela- 
tine. 
About Nitric Acid.—It is easy to make a little 
nitric acid, for all you have to do is to put one 
ounce of Chili_saltpeter, which is sodiwm nitrate, 
in a two-ounce glass Retort with a stopper in it 
and then pour three-fourths of an ounce of sul- 
phurie acid on it. Now fix the retort over a stand 
so that you can heat it over an alcohol lamp or a 
-Bunsen-burner and slip a test tube over the open 
_ ‘stem of the retort. @ 
Next heat the retort, when a chemical reaction 
takes place and the nitric acid will pass off as a 
vapor; to condense it into a liquid let some cold 
water run on the stem of the retort and nitric 
acid will drip into the test tube.. In making 
nitric. acid what takes place is that when the 
sodium nitrate and the sulphuric acid are heated 
together they react and form two new sub- 
stances, which are sgdium_sulpkate and nitric 
acid, the first of which remains behind as a solid 
in the retort and the last passes off as a vapor 
which is then liquified by cooling it with water. 
In making nitric acid on a large scale the 
same process is used as in the previous experi-
-P-A-G-E-70
SOME USEFUL ACIDS : BB 
ment. The mixture of sodium nitrate, or niter 
as itis called, and sulphuric acid is heated in an 
iroh retort and an even temperature is main- 
tained in order to prevent the nitric acid as it is 
foymed from breaking up. Before all of the sul- 
phurie acid in the retort has been used the heat 
_ is cut off and this leaves some of the sodium 
nitrate behind. This with the sodium sulphate 
forms what is called miter cake and this by-prod- 
uct. makes a good fertilizer. The nitric acid 
vapor is passed through a number of condensers 
in which it is cooled until it becomes a liquid. 
Some Properties of Nitric Acid—When pure, 
nitric acid is colorless but usually it has a yellow 
tint due to the presence of a lower oxide of nitro- 
gen and other impurities in it. To clear it of 
these and hence make it colorless a blast of air is 
forced through it which removes whatever gases 
there may be in it. Nitric acid is about_one and 
Sneha Hess os heavy os water, and when it makes contact with the air it fumes. On heating 
nitric acid it breaks up into oxygen and nitrogen 
peroxide which is a reddish gas. Not only heat 
but.sunlight decomposes it to the extent of set- 
ting enough of the latter gas free to discolor it. 
Mitric acid is av oisonou: i 
‘Guid and in the early days of chemistry it was 
called aqua fortis, which means strong water. It 
gives up its oxygen easily and consequently it is
-P-A-G-E-71
   54 WONDERS OF CHEMISTE: 
a powerful oxydizing agent, especially wlien: i 
reacts on vegetable and animal matter,’ Like 
hydrochloric acid it reacts on most metals, but 
* alone it will not dissolve gold or platinum; to-do 
this it must be mixed with hydrochloric acid; as 
_ has been already explained. It has long been used 
as a test, for gold, imitation jewelry and “gold 
bricks.” “Finally it produces very severe burns 
“when it makes contact with living animal tissues 
and hence you must handle it with extreme care. 
‘Uses of Nitric Acid.—You can gain some idea 
“ef the importance of nitric acid when you 
- Know that over 100,000 tons of it. are 
made and used yearly. Fifty years ago the use 
of nitric acid was almost limited to dyeing goods Y 
yellow, i in surgery for cauterizing the flesh, and 
for etching the lines in copper-plate engraving, 
designs on razor blades, swords, etc. Now there 
‘are a dozen or more separate and distinct uses 
i it directly: and indirectly. 
om jt are made potassium nitrate, nitro- 
ce rulose, fertilizer, nitroglycerine, and ériné- 
trotoluol, or TI, as. it is called.} Potassium 
‘ nitrate is used for preserving meat, making gun- 
powder and. asa medicine. Nitrocellulose: is 
~ made into: guncotton, celluloid and collodion.. 
Asa fertilizer it: makes food. Nitroglycerine 
an explosive, is.used in making dynamite and'‘as 
a medicine; while the guncotton so produced'is

SOME USEFUL ACIDS | 55. 
used in mines, torpedoes, etc., and it is the chief 
factor in making smokeless powder. Celluloid 
is used for photographic films, toilet articles,” 
knitting needles, and transparent glass; and 
collodion is used in surgery and as a coating for | 
photographic films. Finally trinitrotoluol is the 
explosive substance used in shells, bombs and. 
torpedoes. 
Extracting Nitric Acid from the Air—Away. 
back in 1781 Cavendish, one of the early chem- 
ists, discovered that whenever he made hydrogen 
and oxygen combine, the water that resulted al- 
ways contained a trace of nitric acid. It is now 
one hundred and forty years since this classic 
experiment was made, but the outcome of it has 
been that latter-day chemists are able to 
fiw the nitrogen in the air, that. is to make the 
nitrogen combine with the oxygen so that nitric 
acid would result. To-day there are several large 
plants where the fivation of atmospheric nitrogen 
is carried on on a large scale. These plants are, 
however, all near large water powers, as cheap 
power must be had in order to produce the nitric 
acid from the air at as low a price as that which 
can be made from Chili saltpeter. 
Although four-fifths of the air is nitrogen, the 
hardest part has always been to extract, or fix 
it, in large quantities and at a low cost. As you 
learned in the first chapter the nitrogen and
-P-A-G-E-73
  56 WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY, 
‘oxygen of the air will combine only when these 
gases are heated to something like 8,000 degrees _ 
Centigrade; when raised to this high tempera- 
ture they then combine and nitric acid results. 
The way this is done is to blow the air through 
a pipe or chimney in which there is an electric 
arc, the hottest flame that has yet been produced 
on earth, when the heat changes a part of it into 
nitric oxide. When this is cooled more oxygen 
combines with it and this in turn forms nitrogen 
tetrowide; the latter then passes through a tower 
in which water trickles down, and on coming in 
‘contact with the water it is absorbed and reaches 
the bottom as nitric acid. “ 
“» Some Other Acids—There are a large num- 
-ber of other acids but the five below mentioned: 
are, after sulphuric, hydrochloric and nitric acids, 
the most important. 
' Acetic Acid—After apple juice stands for 
some time it begins to ferment when alcohol is 
produced and this makes cider of it. The longer 
it stands the more it ferments, hence the more 
alcohol it has in it and the “ harder” it gets. If 
allowed to. stand long enough it gets sour and 
becomes vinegar. It gets sour because the 
alcohol is converted into acetic acid. This 
change is caused by numerous Bacteria aceti, a

Tartaric Acid.—Grapes contain an acid called 
potassium tartrate and this is commonly known 
as tartaric acid, or cream of tartar. While yeast 
is most generally used for making bread rise, 
baking powder comes next. The purpose of 
both yeast and baking powder is to liberate car- 
bon diowide and it is this gas when set free that 
really causes the dough to rise. Baking powder 
is usually made of tartaric acid and sodium 
bicarbonate; the former, together with the mois- 
ture in the dough, acts on the latter when it sets 
free its carbon dioxide. 
Carbolic Acid—The chemical name of car- 
bolic acid is phenol and it is a coal-tar, product, 
that is it is extracted from coal-tar. To separate 
it from the coal-tar the latter is treated with 
caustic soda, that is sodium hydroxide, which dis- 
solves it out. Carbolic acid is best known as a 
disinfectant and it is a good one because it vio- 
lently attacks matter that is decomposing. 
Practically all the carbolic acid that we used be-

The only | known element that will not unite with 
oxygen is fluorine, but it will unite with hydro- 
gen and when it does so hydrofluoric acid results. 
The peculiarity of hydrofluoric acid is. that: it 
has a very corrosive action on glass, that is it dis- 
solyes out the silica, which is the sand, in ‘the 
. glass and, hence, it is used for etching designs’on 
bottles and other glassware. Since it ‘will eat 
glass it must be kept in paraffin, rubber or lead

OLD METALS AND NEW ALLOYS 
Just as the use of fire set early man above the 
ape-like man in intelligence, so the use of metals 
marked the development of his progress and, 
hence, of his civilization. At first he was only 
able to use those metals that are found free in 
nature, such as copper, gold and silver, and as 
the former metal was the most plentiful as well - 
as the best adapted for making tools and imple- 
ments it was the first to come into general use. 
When_early man.was-ableto-discard his-stone ° 
tools for eo copper ones the first great stride toward 
civilization was made. 
But. copper is too soft a metal to be made into 
really. successful tools, and it was not until man_ 
had found a way to extract iron from the oxide 
it is combined: with that the present great era— 
the iron and steel age—dawned’and that was not 
more than two hundred years ago. The copper 
age.and the iron and steel age, then, roughly 
mark the great periods through which mankind 
has progressed and is progressing in his onward 
march of civilization.

About Copper and Its Ores.—This_metal ‘is 
found free, or native, that is in practically.a pure 
state in some parts of the world, especially in the 
Lake Superior region. Some of the mines in this 
district are very ancient and stone implements 
have been unearthed in them that belonged to a 
race who lived: there before the Indians. But 
copper is found chiefly in ores, that is in the form 
of copper sulphide mixed with rock, and small 
amounts of lead, silver and gold-are often in- 
cluded in it. In order to separate the cOpper 
from the ore the latter must be crushed and 
--smelted. When a piece of pure copper is polished 
it has a rich reddish-brown color; but while copper 
does not rust like iron, it soon takes on a coating 
of oxide, sulphide or carbonate depending on 
which one of these elements has reacted with it. 
The way copper sulphide is formed is thus 
shown: take a test tube, put some sulphur in it and 
heat it over an alcohol lamp or a Bunsen burner 
until it boils. Now dip a strip of copper into the 
test tube when it will take on a dull black color. 
On removing the strip you will find that it is no 
longer copper and it is certainly not sulphur. 
What has happened is that the copper and the 
sulphur have'combined chemically and in so do- 
ing a new substance has been formed, which is 
copper sulphide.. Lf now you will heat the cop- 
per sulphide to a high enough temperature to ~-
-P-A-G-E-78
OLD METALS AND NEW ALLOYS 61 
melt: the copper the sulphur will be driven off 
and pure copper will remain behind. This then 
is the way that nature makes copper. sulphide 
and the way man recovers the copper from it. 
Extracting the Copper from Its Ores.—As 
the copper sulphide, or other copper ore, is mixed 
up with rock, the first thing to do is to concen- 
trate it, which in the early days of copper min- 
ing was done by hand, and it is sometimes 
done ‘in this primitive fashion even now at 
small mines, but generally it is done in stamp | 
mills. After the ore has been concentrated there 
are two ways in which the copper can be ex~- 
tracted from it: (1) by smelting, and (2) by 
leaching. 
_ Smelting Copper Ores.—The first thing that 
is done where the ore is to be smelted is to pile it 
up in a heap, or put it in a kiln, and heat it, or 
roast it as it is called. This drives off a large 
part of the sulphur and other foreign matter in 
the form of gases. Next the ore thus treated is 
put into a blast furnace, or a reverberatory 
furnace,’ where it is heated to a high enough 
temperature to fuse the mass with coke and this 
yields a matte, that is the crude copper and a slag 
formed of all the impurities. These are easily 
separated for since the slag is the lightest it floats 
This kind of a furnace has a vaulted ceiling that throws back 
the heat-and flame on the surface of the molten metal.

on the molten copper which is then drawti “off 
into bars. This method of smelting is known as 
the reduction process. 
Wet Method of Extraction. —This method, 
which is called leaching, is used only where there 
is a very small per cent of copper in the ore. In 
this case the ore is roasted with salt and the 
copper compounds formed are washed out. by 
forcing water through the pile. The copper is 
then precipitated, that is, thrown down, when it 
_ is collected, and melted and refined in a furnace 
and cast into ingots. 
Refining of Crude Copper.—After the copper 
is extracted by one or the other of the processes 
described above it still contains many impurities 
and, hence, it is called crude copper. To remove 
. as.much of the foreign matter that still remains 
in it as possible the copper is placed in a rever- 
beratory furnace where it is melted and a blast of 
air is forced across the surface to oxidize it. 
Then it is. poled, that is it is stirred with green- 
wood poles while it is molten and this process 
brings a large amount of the impurities to the 
surface. To obtain really pure copper, however, 
it must be refined by the electrolytic process, and 
much of it is refined in this way at the present 
time. This process is described in Chapter XIII, 
under Hlectro-chemical Processes. 
Some Uses of Copper—Copper is a very

ductile and malleable metal and next to silver it 
is is_the_best_conductor of heat_and_ electricity, 
Now while heating iron and dipping it into cold 
water hardens it, it does just the reverse with 
copper, that is it softens it. When copper burns 
it gives forth a peculiar green flame that is al-. 
ways easy to recognize. In order to dissolve it 
you must use nitric acid. 
Copper is used for so large a number of pur- 
poses it would take a chapter to tell all of them; 
in fact it has a larger number-of-usesthan any 
other meta] excepting iron. Large-.quantities of 
it are used in the electrical industries, as for in- 
stance wire for winding dynamos and motors, 
telephone wires and cables, electric light. and 
trolley lines. -Hundreds of uses are found for 
sheet copper from making coffee pots to making © 
distillery stills. It is used for roofing and for 
many other purposes where air and water or both 
would attack other metals. Among its interest- 
ing uses are for electroplating and electrotyping ° 
and these will be described in the chapter-on 
Electro-chemistry. Finally it enters into the 
composition of a large number of alloys, of which 
the following are.a few:

Different from nearly all the other metals, iron. 
is found in every country on | the face the face of the earth : 
so that each nation has a supply of its own. All ; 
they need to do is to mine the ore, melt the metal _- 
out from it, and work it up into things that make . - 
for the highest kind of civilization. Unlike ~ 
copper, iron is seldom found native, that is‘in the 
metallic:state, and this is the reason its use was. 
so long delayed. It needed time and required _ 
genius to take the ore and extract the iron from 
it. -But when it was once done the development 
of the metal went forward at a rapid pace and « 
invention paralleled its progress, 
Smelting Iron Ores.—The process used to. 
make the ore give up the iron locked in it is a 
simple one. <A blast furnace is built up of stone 
or brick or iron and lined with fire clay. A run- 
way is built over the ‘fop of the furnace so that 
the fuel and ore and ‘limestone can be dumped 
into-it in alternate layers. At the bottom of the 
furnace is a pipe, called a tuyére, through which 
a blast of air is forced, hence the name blast 
furnace. The air blast supplies the extra oxygen 
necessary to raise the temperature of the burn- 
ing: fuel to a point where it will melt the iron. 
At:the bottom of the furnace below the air blast 
 
-P-A-G-E-85
66 WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY - 
pipe is a slag hole through which the slag is run 
off, and below the slag hole is the tap hole 
‘through which the molten iron is run off. 
In the action that takes place the limestone 
combines with the rock and other impurities and 
this forms. a hard, glass-like slag. Since the 
molten iron is heavier than the slag it falls to the 
‘bottom of the furnace when, in the older plants, it 
runs off into a main channel, called the sow, that 
is cut into the sand floor. From the sow the iron 
runs into smaller channels that lead from and at 
right. angles to it and these are called pigs and 
this is the way that pig-iron got its name. In 
more modern blast furnaces a mechanically 
operated ladle is filled with the molten iron and 
from this it is poured into successive iron molds 
“which are mounted on an endless chain. 
Kinds of Iron—As iron is an element, of 
course, there is really only one kind when it is 
pure. But pure iron is almost unknown in the 
industries, and practically all of it that is used 
has some carbon in‘ it. By Jinds of iron are 
meant iron which contains different amounts, or 
percentages, of carbon, for varying amounts of 
carbon give to iron wholly different properties. 
There are three different kinds of iron and these 
are cast iron, wrought iron and steel. Cast iron 
contains from two to five per cent of carbon; 
wrought iron about. one-half of one per cent of
-P-A-G-E-86
OLD METALS AND NEW ALLOYS 67 
carbon; and steel from one to two per cent of 
carbon, 
Cast Iron.—When iron comes from the blast 
furnace it is hard and can neither be welded nor 
wrought. While nearly all metals contract upon 
cooling, iron expands and this property makes it 
especially useful for casting since it makes a 
sharp copy of the pattern. Cast iron can be 
annealed, that is made soft enough to be ma- 
chined, by slowly cooling it, or very hard by pour- 
ing it into iron molds, or chills as they are called, 
and for this reason iron thus cast is known ‘as 
‘chilled iron. It was long in use for making plow- 
shares and burglar proof safes before steel be- _ 
came available. 
Wrought or Malleable Iron—-When a cur- 
rent of highly heated air is passed over molten 
cast iron it burns out nearly all of the carbon in 
it, and in this way it is made into wrought iron. 
To get all of the slag out of the iron it is ham- 
mered.under-a trip hammer while it is still red- 
hot and then rolled between rollers with. grooves 
in them. When these operations are complete 
the iron is soft and can be worked and welded. 
Steel. —Steel is made of cast iron by any one 
of a number of processes, ses, but the purpose of all 
of them js to burn out a part of the carbon and to 
change that part which remains to iron carbide, 
hence there is no free carbon in the steel. Various
-P-A-G-E-87
68 WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY, — 
kinds of steel have different amounts of iron car- 
bide in them depending on the use to which they 
are to be put; thus we have mild, half- hard and 
tool steels, 
The Bessemer Converter Process.—Sir Henry 
Bessemer was the first to discover a way to make 
cheap steel. His process consists of a large cru- 
cible supported on pivots so that it can be tilted 
and the metal poured out. It is open at the top 
and an air-blast pipe connects with the inside at 
the bottom. A few tons of the best cast iron is 
melted and poured into the converter, as the 
crucible is called. A blast of air is now forced 
into, up and through the molten iron, when the 
oxygen of the former raises the temperature to 
a point where the excess carbon is burned out 
while the remaining carbon: combines with the 
iron and forms iron carbide. The whole opera- 
tion of converting iron into steel takes only about 
twenty minutes. 
The Open Hearth Process.—In this process a 
shallow circular crucible is enclosed in a furnace 
heated by gas. The crucible is filled with pig- 
iron, steel scrap and iron ore, and the charge is 
brought to a molten state by heating it with a gas 
'. flame burning in a blast of air. It takes twenty- 
four hours to convert iron into steel by this proc- 
ess, but the steel so made is of a far better quality 
than that made by the Bessemer process.
-P-A-G-E-88
OLD METALS AND NEW ALLOYS 69 | 
The Crucible Process —Where a fine and ‘uni- 
form steel is needed, as for tool-making or special 
alloys, the crucible process is used. In this proc- 
ess pure wrought iron and steel are placed in a 
large gtaphite crucible, together with a certain 
amount of charcoal. The crucible is then heated 
until the iron and steel in it are melted, when the 
additional carbon required is extracted froni the 
charcoal. As only small quantities of steel can 
be made at a time by this process it is expen- 
sive. 
The Electric Furnace Process.—This process 
bids fair to displace the crucible process. just de- 
scribed, for not only can better steel be made by 
the latter than by the former, but it can be made 
in a shorter time and it is not so costly. The 
electric furnace has a shallow circular crucible. 
like the open-hearth furnace, but instead of gas 
burning in an air blast it is heated by an electric 
are formed between two carbon electrodes. 
New Steel Alloys—-There are a number of 
new, interesting and highly useful alloys that are 
made by mixing certain metals with steel. For 
instance, by mixing from 2 to 4 per cent of 
nickel with steel, an alloy is made which is very 
hard and elastic and resists the action of sea- 
water. Nickel steel, as it is called, is used for 
undersea cables, propeller shafts for ships and 
armor-plate for battle-ships.

By adding 16 to 20 per cent of tungsten, % to 
‘34 per cent of carbon, 2% to 5 per cent of chro- 
mium and 14 to 1% per cent of vanadium to steel, 
an alloy called high-speed steel results. This re- 
markable metal does not lose its temper even 
when it gets red-hot, hence it is used for making 
high-speed tools, and for this reason it is called 
high-speed steel. 
Vanadium steel, or chrome vanadium steel, to 
give it its full name, has a high tensile strength, 
and while it is very springy it can be bent double 
without breaking. It is therefore largely used 
for making frames and springs for automo- 
biles. It consists of 1 per cent of chromium 
and .15 per cent of vanadium mixed with the 
steel. 
The hardest and most wear-resisting metal 
known is the alloy called manganese steel. It 
contains from 7 to 20 per cent of manganese and 
1% per cent of carbon. Owing to its great _ 
hardness it is used for switches and crossovers for 
railways, for the steel jaws of rock crushers, for 
burglar-proof safes, and the like. 
About Alwminwm.—Aluminum + ‘gets its name 
from alwm, and it was first extracted by treating 
aluminum chloride with metallic sodiwm. It is 
contained in clay, slate, mica and feldspar rocks 
and next to oxygen and silicon silicon there i is more of ee 
the earth’s trust than aiiy other e element. It has Tt

a bright silvery appearance; it does not ‘tarnish 
when exposed to air, and weighs only about‘o one-. 
third as much as iron. 
Notwithstanding there are such large stores of 
aluminum to draw from, for every bank of clay is. 
full of it, it is hard to extract, foy itis never found 
free. From the time the metal was obtained in 
1845 by Deville, who made it by heating alwmi- 
num chloride with metallic potassium, it re- 
mained so costly (ninety dollars a pound) that a 
sample of it was looked upon as a curiosity. 
This state of affairs continued until 1886, 
when Charles W. Hall, a young man of twenty- 
two who had just graduated from Oberlin Col- 
lege, found that by mixing cryolite, a mineral 
that melts at a low temperature and which is a 
‘poor conductor of electricity, with beauzite, an 
ore containing from 50 to 70 per cent of alwmi- 
num. ogide, then melting them together, and 
passing a current through the solution, the alu- 
minum oxide was decomposed and the metal alu- . 
minum was produced. 
Uses of Aluminum.—tThe fact that this metal 
is.so light, good to look upon, and that it is not 
affected by the air, makes it an admirable metal 
to usé'for cooking utensils, especially where these 
_are for camping. Aluminum is a very good con- 
ductor of electricity and is largely used for cables 
in high-tension lines. It is also used for welding
-P-A-G-E-91
rR WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY 
‘and making pure metals by the thermit process, 
besides having many other uses. 
The Thermit Process.—Take a strip of alumi- 
num and heat in an alcohol or a Bunsen flame, | 
when you will find that before it gets red-hot it 
will become coated with a thin layer of white 
powder which is aluminum oxide. Now take a 
bit of aluminum foil and hold it with your for- 
ceps in a jar of oxygen, and then touch a red-hot 
iron wire to it, when it will vanish in a bright flash 
leaving a white powder behind which is, again, 
aluminum oxide. When al aluminum combines 
with oxygen it develops a temperature so high 
that it will melt any of the ‘metals, and this is the 
principle on which the thermit process is based. 
The thermit apparatus is very simple. It is 
a conical crucible with the small end down and 
whose bottom can be removed. Into this is 
placed a mixture of iron oxide and powdered 
aluminum with a fuse leading half-way into it 
from the top. When the fuse is ignited the alu- 
minum combines with the oxygen of the iron 
oxide, and this generates enough heat to melt the 
iron which then falls to the bottom of the cru- 
cible, where it can be run off into a:mold. In 
this way not only pure iron or steel can be had 
but broken castings can be repaired. When the 
oxides of other metals are placed in the crucible 
the metals are melted in the same way.

‘The Gas Called Ammonia.—When you go to

you get a bottle filled with a transparent liquid,

for ainmonia is a gas—dissolved in it. Since this 
_is the case it should be and often is labeled aqua 
ammonia, which means ammonia water, since 
aqua is Latin for water. Ammonia that you get

In the long ago ammonia gas was called harts- 
horn and ammonia in water was known as spirits 
of hartshorn. Now a hart is a kind of a deer, 
and as ammonia was first made from the horns 
‘of a hart, it came by this queer name honestly. 
The name ammonia was given to it because sal 
ammoniac, one of its compounds, was first made. 
near the Temple of Jupiter Ammon. 
Ammonia gas is plentiful, as it is formed when 
vegetable matter decays and, hence, even the air 
we breathe often contains considerable quantities 
_ of it, but it is obtained on a commercial scale as 4 
by-product when coal-gas is made, that is when 
bituminous coal (soft coal) is subjected to de- 
structive distillation in a closed retort. Now, 
soft coal contains both nitrogen and hydrogen, 
and when the coal is heated in the retort these 
two gases combine and form ammonia gas. This 
is, of course, mixed with the illuminating gas but 
is separated from the latter by passing them 
through water, when the ammonia gas is dissolved 
out and the solution that is left is called ammo- 
niacal liquor. 
You can make enough ammonia gas to detect 
the odor of it by heating any kind of lean meat,

-the odor of ammonia gas which passes out 
through the delivery tube. 
The Properties of Ammonia.—Ammonia is a 
colorless gas, is about half as heavy as as air and six. 
hundred volumes of it will dissolve in one volume — . 
of water at about 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Am- 
monia will not burn in air at ordinary tempera- 
tures, but it burns with a greenish yellow flame in 
oxygen. Should you inhale a very little ammo- 
nia tears, will flow, and should you get into a room 
where it is escaping it may suffocate you. It will 
neutralize any. of the acids and in so doing forms various useful salts. 
For example, to make sal ammoniac, all you 
need to do is to slowly pour a little agua ammonia 
- Into hydrochloric acid; test the solution as you 
are making it with tmus paper, and when it no 
longer turns red you-will know that it has been 
-neutralized. Now heat the solution in a porce- 
lain dish until it has evaporated, when only a 
vhite powder is left, and this is sal ammoniac. “ 
The Gas Called. Chlorine. —Chlorine belongs

to the halogen family, the other members of 
- which are iodine, bromine and fluorine. These 
four elements are quite alike in many respects, 
and they got their family name halogen from 
hals, which means salt, from which chlorine is 
largely obtained; in fact, sixty per cent of com- 
mon salt, that is, sodium chloride, is made up of 
this gas. To make chlorine you heat manganese 
dioxide, sodium chloride and sulphuric acid to- 
gether, and when these react on each other man- 
ganese sulphate, sodium sulphate and water are 
formed and chlorine is liberated, the latter in 
large quantities. 
Some Properties of Chlorine——If you should

Chlorine and water get along very well to- 
gether, and two volumes of the former will mix 
with one volume of the Jatter; if, now, this solu- 
tion is exposed to the sunlight it will change into 
hydrochloric acid and oxygen. But chlorine loves 
hydrogen as a miser loves his gold, and it will

extract it from any vegetable matter that con- | 
tains it, and when these two gases combine they 
form hydrochloric acid. 
Bleaching With Chlorine —The great value of. 
chlorine lies in its power to take the color out 
-of certain kinds of materials, particularly cotton 
and paper, and this it does with great rapidity. 
This is because nearly all coloring matter, except 
printers’ ink, contains hydrogen, with which it 
instantly combines. As printers’ ink does not | 
contain hydrogen it is not affected by it. 
Owing to this peculiar property of chlorine for 
combining with hydrogen and so attacking color- 
ing matter, it is largely used for bleaching both 
muslins and paper. Where muslins are to be 
bleached at home, the housewife begins by remov- 
ing the grease from it, which she does by boiling 
it in water with soap. ‘Then she lays the goods 
on the clean grass, when the hydrogen that is in 
the coloring matter combines with the oxygen of | 
the air and the dew and so in due time the goods 
are bleached perfectly white. The goods are not 
only bleached but they are made sweet and clean. 
Home bleaching as described above is a slow 
process, and so where muslins are to be bleached 
on a commercial scale a different process is used, 
though the principle is the same. First the 
grease is removed from the muslin by boiling it in 
water in which alkalis have been dissolved.
-P-A-G-E-97

This done, it goes through a solution of chloride 
of lime and water, and then through a weak solu- 
tion of sulphuric acid. It is at this stage that the 
acid and the chloride of lime react and this sets 
free the chlorine; this then combines with the 
hydrogen that is in the coloring matter of the 
goods and hydrochloric acid is formed. In many 
cases the chlorine extracts hydrogen from the 
water, thus freeing oxygen, which in turn de- 
stroys the color. Large quantities of chlorine 
are used in paper mills to bleach the rags 
from which linen paper is made and also to 
‘bleach the wood pulp from which newspaper is 
made. 
Chlorine as a Disinfectant .—Not only is chlo- 
rine a great bleaching agent but it is also a pow- 
erful disinfectant, and for the same reason. That 
is to say, it disinfects in exactly the same way as 
it. bleaches, namely, by combining with the hy- 
_ drogen; in the latter case the hydrogen is in the 
refuse or other disease-bearing matter and so 
breaking it up. A simple method of producing 
chlorine for the sick room is to place some chlo- 
ride of lime in a saucer and moisten it with water. 
The gas is soon set free and begins its work of 
purification. 
Helium, the New G'as.—Away hack in the 
year of 1869 Professor Lockyer, a noted British 
astronomer, while examining the sun with his

spectroscope, discovered a gas which was at.that _. 
time unknown on the earth, and he believed it to 
be an element that existed in the sun only; he 
called’ this gas helium from the Greek word 
helios, which means sun. A quarter of a century 
later Sir William Ramsay made a siccession of | 
brilliant researches which resulted in the disea+ 
ery of argon, neon, krypton and wenon, as“éx~ 
plained in Chapter I, and as_a final climax he 
discovered a gas that was identical with the he- 
liwm of the sun discovered by Lockyer. Since 
they were alike, Ramsay also called the gas 
helium. : 
The way he made the discovery was thus: 
He was boiling clévite, a rare mineral, in some 
.dilute sulphuric acid to find out whether the gas 
that was given off and which was believed to be 
nitrogen contained any argon. When, however, 
he examined the gas with his spectroscope, he 
found that instead of the gas being nitrogen it 
was helium. Since then a large number of min- 
erals have been tested for helium and quite a 
number have been found to contain small quanti- 
ties of it, as well as some other gases. 
Natural gas from the wells in various parts of 
the United States contains considerable quantities

The Government will probably acquire the rights’ 
to them, and the question of sealing them for fus - 
ture use is now being considered, as this would - 
. give the United States a mopopoly, practically, 
of the world’s chief sources of supply. The way 
‘. in which helium is obtained from natural gas is. 
to liquefy the latter, when the former still remains- 
a gas. 
” Ihe Use for Inflating Balloons—Helium is a 
“eolorless. gas and, next to hydrogen, it is the 
lightest gas known, having a lifting power of 50 
per cent of the latter. Like argon and the other 
“gases that Sir William Ramsay discovered in the 
_ atmosphere, helium is: inert; that_is it will not- 
“unite chemically with other elements. This be- - 
ing true, it_will not burn and it is easy to see that. 
it'is'an ideal gas with which to inflate spherical | 
and dirigible balloons. The greatest difficulty is 
to‘obtain-enough of it and at a price that would 
make its use practicable, and this the United. 
States, Navy has now done. 2 
The first balloon in the world to be filled with - 
helium was the C-7, a navy dirigible. On Decem- 
ber 5, 1921, she was inflated with this gas at the 
naval air station at Hampton Roads, Va., when.

she returned to her hangar at Hampton Roads 
she showed that not a particle of gas had escaped 
through the fabric of which the bag was made, _ 
whereas with hydrogen there is always | some 
small leakage due to diffusion. 
This pioneer test of the use of helium for in- 
flating balloons and airships marks the passing of 
the highly inflammable hydrogen, for a gas that is 
perfectly safe, and in the near future we can ex- 
pect the prohibition of the use of hydrogen alone 
for’ this purpose, as a mixture one-fourth helium 
is not inHammable. 
_ Some Bad Gases.—Gases we may call bad are 
the killers; that is, they are made and used pur- 
' posely to destroy human life. This idea of mak- 
ing poison gases, as they are called, appealed to 
: Germany, and from the time the Great War 
began until it ended the Germans made and used - 
over twenty different kinds. 
_ The first poison gas wag chlorine, which they 
used early in 1915 at Ypres, and they chose 
chlorine as being the safest for themselves as well 
 
-P-A-G-E-103
82 WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY. 
The way they used it was to wait until the 
wind was blowing over their own front and in the 
direction of the opposing front. Then. they 
released great volumes of chlorine at intervals 
along their front and the wind carried the deadly 
fumes over to the French. As chlorine is two 
and one-half times heavier than air it rolled along 
the ground and when it came to the trenches they 
were filled with it. The soldiers in them were 
attacked by coughing, but soon they were suffo- 
cated. So deadly were the effects of the gas that 
only twenty per cent of the men were still alive 
and available for service after the air had dissi- 
pated the fumes: 
_ By the time they next attempted to use chlo- 
rine the Allies were ready and met and warded 
off the death-dealing fumes with gas-masks which 
were prepared with alkali-carbonate, and this 
counteracted the effect of the gas. Since chlorine 
eould not be easily controlled when it was used 
in this way, and also because the Germans found 
the Allies were able to defeat its use with gas- 
masks, they changed over to another poison-gas 
called phosgene. 
This new poison gas was formed of chlorine 
and cgrbon ide, and instead of liberating it 
and letting the wind blow it over the lines of the 
Allies, they loaded shells with it and then fired 
them from guns and mortars, and the effect
-P-A-G-E-104

would have been more deadly than where free. 
chlorine was used but for the fact that the British 
‘ had learned through secret channels that they 
were going to use it. Thus forewarned.the Allies 
had gas-helmets made with hexamethylene te- 
tramine in them, and this counteracted the effects 
of the gas. 
After this the Germans followed with the poi- 
son gas henzyt- bromide, or tear gas as it was com- 
monly called. This gas had a terrible effect on 
the eyes of the victims, making them water until 
they could not see and finally blinding them. 
They next used diphenyl chlorgarsine, or sneex- 
ing gas, and this made its victims sneeg® so hard 
they were compelled to take off their masks and 
so expose themselves to the deadly fumes. 
While the Germans were trying out these va- 
rious poison gases the Allies were busy inventing 
new ones in self-defense. Here in the United 
States enormous quantities of a gas called 
chlgrapicrin was made. The purpose of it was 
not so much to kill as to make the victims vomit, 
when they would have to take off their gas-masks. 
On doing so, they got a dose of tin chloride which 
suffocated them. This substance, which is 
formed of tin and chlorine, was loaded into the 
shell along with the chloropicrin, which is a com- 
pound of picric acid and chlorine, so that both 
_ gases were set free at the same time. It is doubt-
-P-A-G-E-105
84 » WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY 
ful if the Germans could make a gascmask that 
would withstand the onslaughts of both of these 
gases. 
The most painful poison gas that the dénemy 
used, though not the most deadly, was dichloro- 
digthyl-sulphide, otherwise known as mustard gas, 
and at different periods of the war as many as 
fifty thousand shells filled with it were thrown in 
a single night into the trenches of the Allies. 
This gas was formed of chlorine, aleohol and 
sulphur, and when these substances are combined 
they form a gas that is very penetrating and one 
_ which lasts a long time. It smells not so much 
like oil of mustard as it does like garlic, but it 
hurts the eyes like a mixture of them, only a 
' thousand times worse. It attacks the victim’s 
eyes, nose, throat and lungs and makes them 
burn and blister, and all the while the pain it 
causes is intense. The best thing that can be 
said about mustard is that if the victim can be 
treated immediately after being gassed with it he 
stands a fair chance of recovery.

FROM GUNPOWDER TO TNT 
WE are apt to think of gunpowder and other 
explosives as belonging only to the arts of war, 
but they have many uses in the pursuits of peace 
as well. It is usual to give the Chinese the 
credit of having discovered gunpowder and it is 
quite certain that they made firecrackers with it 
at least two thousand years ago; what is more, 
they still make them, to the great joy of the 
American boy who likes above all things to 
“shoot them off” in celebration of « our nation’s 
birthday. 
Marco Polo, the boy traveller, who visited 
China about twelve hundred years ago, saw there 
the explosive effects of the mysterious black sub- 
stance, which was later named gunpowder, and 
he learned how it was made. On returning to 
Arabia some of it was made and its power tried 
out by firing it from a tube in which a stone was 
loaded. This, then, was the crude beginning of 
the gigantic guns that wrought such havoc dur-. 
ing the World War. 
: About five or six hundred years after the

Arabs made their first experiments with gun- 
powder as a weapon of war, other travellers took 
the art of making gunpowder into Italy and 
from there it found its way into Germany. The 
first time that gunpowder and cannon were actu- 
ally used in warfare was in 1346 at the battle of 
Crécy, but they did not displace the long bow and. 
, bow-gun, or arquebus, as the latter is called, for 
many years after, and gunpowder remained the 
only explosive known until the last century, 
when nitroglycerine was invented. 
How Gunpowder is Made——Gunpowder is a 
simple mechanical mixture of Bengal saltpeter, 
that is potassium nitrate, sulphur and charcoal. 
Each of these substances is powdered and then 
‘all. of them are thoroughly mixed together. 
Enough water is now added to the mass to make. 
a paste of it, when it is allowed to stand until the 
water has dried out of it and a hard, black cake 
‘xemains. The cake is then broken up into fine 
or coarse grains according to what the powder is 
to be used for. Where it is to be used for sport- 
ing guns.of small caliber the grains must be very 
fine, while for guns of large caliber the grains 
must be proportionately large. To understand 
how and why gunpowder explodes you should 
know something about each of the ingredients 
that is used init. 
Potassium nitrate, which is also called nitrate
-P-A-G-E-108
FROM GUNPOWDER TO TNT 87 
of. potash, saltpeter or just niter for short, is, as 
-its name indicates, formed of nitrogen and pot- 
ash. Saltpeter is found in India and in various 
other tropical countries but only in small quan- 
tities. It was formerly made by leaching, that is 
by piling up the refuse of stables and other de- 
eaying vegetable matter together with some 
mortar. Then at the end of two or three years 
the piles are washed out, when for every cubic 
foot of the matter some five ounces of saltpeter 
will be produced. During the War of 1812 
saltpeter was made in Mammoth Cave, Ken- 
tucky, and to this day a part of the plant to- 
gether with the tracks of the wagon wheels may 
still be seen there. 
In. Chili, South America, there are great beds 
of sodium nitrate, called Chili saltpeter, and in 
Stassfurt, Germany, there are even greater beds 
of. potassium chloride, so chemists set to work to 
make potassium nitrate out of them. This they 
did by mixing the potassium chloride with a hot 
solution of sodium nitrate, when the following 
reaction takes place:

nitrate ide, 
Charcoal, as you know, is made by heating 
wood in.a closed retort. It is nearly pure carbon 
. and has so many little pores that in a cubic inch
-P-A-G-E-109
88 “WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY 
of it there is nearly one hundred feet of surface. 
Sulphur is one of the earliest known elements and 
it played a great part in the experiments of the 
alchemists of old who vainly tried to transmute 
the baser metals into gold. It is found free in 
various countries, especially in the volcanic 
regions of Sicily. We get our supply chiefly 
- from Texas and Louisiana, though it is mined in 
other parts of the United States. 
When Gunpowder is Fired—The explosive 
force of gunpowder is caused by the gases which 
are set free by the burning substances and which 
expand enormously. .The instant the powder is 
ignited the saltpeter liberates its oxygen and the 
carbon and sulphur burn in it at white heat. , 
The enormous heat developed makes the gases ex- 
pand until, if they were free, they would take up 
a thousand five hundred times as much space as 
that which the powder originally occupied and 
this produces the force needed to drive the bullet 
from the barrel of the gun. One-third of the 
burned gunpowder is in a solid state and this 
passes off as smoke, except for a small part which 
is left behind in the barrel of the gun. 
It is a part of these solid products of combus- 
tion of the powder that cling to the inside of the 
barrel of the gun and foul it, and unless the ut- 
most care is taken to keep it clean the particles 
of matter will keep on building up until a hard
-P-A-G-E-110
FROM GUNPOWDER TO. TT 89 
crust is formed the entire length of. it. Now 
since the bore of the barrel and the outside 
diameter of the bullet are practically the same, 
when the latter is forced through the former by 
the expanding gases the crust not only ‘slows 
down the speed but also tears off bits of lead 
and these foul the gun still more. 
Besides excessive fouling, another very bad 
feature of black-powder, as common gunpowder 
is called, is that the large volumes of dense smoke 
given off when it is used in large guns for mili- 
tary operations, show the enemy exactly where 
they are located. The search for an explosive 
that would do away with both the fouling and 
the smoke led to the invention of smokeless 
powder. 
How Smokeless Powders are Made.—Smoke- 
less powder is entirely unlike black powder in 
every respect except that it explodes. For in- 
stance, where the ingredients of black powder are 
merely mixed together, those of smokeless pow- 
der are chemically combined, and where black 
powder explodes on being ignited, smokeless _ 
powder explodes by concussion, that is when it is 
subjected to shock. This is because the chem- 
icals of which it is made are very unstable com- . 
pounds and a shock is enough to decompose them. 
_ As a matter of fact, smokeless powder is of two 
different kinds, the first of which is- called
-P-A-G-E-111
90 WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY 
nitrocellulose powder and the second is called 
nitroglycerine powder. 
Nitrocellulose powder is made of pyromlin, or 
guncotton, to call it by its common name. Gin-~ 
cotton, in turn, is made by treating pure cotton 
with nitric and sulphuric acids and then wash- 
ing the excess of them out of it thoroughly.. The 
acids dissolve away everything except the pure 
cellulose, which is the chief substance that makes 
up all kinds of plants, with which the strong nitric 
acid combines. For blasting purposes guncot- 
ton is sometimes made of wood pulp, from which 
print paper is also manufactured, but for military 
powders a good grade of cotton must be used. 
In either case after the guncotton has been made - 
it is mixed with either acetone or ether and al- 
- gohol, when it becomes a dough-like mass. The 
“next step is to feed it into a machine which rolls 
. it out into rods and these are cut tip into various 
sized grains according to what the powder is to 
be used for. Finally the grains are dried out | 
thoroughly to expel the acetone or ether and al- 
-eohol. 
Nitroglycerine powder is made of one-half 
. guncotton and one-half nitroglycerine, or glyc- 
eryl nitrate;-as the chemists call it. Nitro- 
glycerine results when glycerine is treated with 
nitric and sulphuric acids. Nitroglycerine pow- 
der is not as well adapted for use in sporting
-P-A-G-E-112
“FROM GUNPOWDER TO TNT 91 
guns as nitrocellulose powder, for’ it. develops 
more heat and sets free acids which attack and 
pit the steel of the gun-barrels.” 
- Smokeless powders have not only the ‘ad- 
vantage of developing practically no smoke but 
since they produce very small amounts of solid 
matter these are forced out of the gun-barrel by 
‘the gases. Smokeless powders are, however, 
more dangerous to use than black powder for 
they detonate, that is explode instantly, whereas 
black powder simply burns away. ,} a 
Dynamite and Cordite.—Dynamite is made by 
mixing nitroglycerine with sawdust, flour or some 
other inactive material and then forming the 
‘mass into sticks. The inactive material is used to 
keep the molecules of the explosive as far apart 
from each other as possible, since this prevents thé 
nitroglycerine from detonating, that is exploding 
instantly, hence there is less danger of its going . 
off prematurely. 
Cordite is an explosive that made millions for 
its inventor, Alfred Nobel, of Sweden. It is, in 
fact, a kind of smokeless powder, since it is made 
of guncotton and nitroglycerine mixed with a lit- 
tle vaseline. These three ingredients are dissolved 
in acetone, a substance that is obtained as a by- ’ 
product. when wood is distilled in a closed retort. 
After. the ingredients have been dissolved in the 
acetone’ the resultant mass is rolled into sheets fone
-P-A-G-E-113
92 WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY 
which are cut up into various-sized pieces, The 
final process consists of drying out the acetone, 
and when this is done a horn-like material results 
that goes by the name of cordite. 
Lyddite, Melinite and Shimose—Another 
kind of high explosive is made from phenol, 
whose common name is carbolic acid. When 
phenol is heated with nitric and sulphuric acids 
yellow crystals are formed, and this substance is 
trinitrophenol, or picric acid. This acid is a high 
explosive, and in the early part of the World War 
it was one of the hardest substances to obtain. 
Picric acid is the chief ingredient that is used by 
the British in making lyddite, by the French in 
making melinite and by the Japanese in making 
shimose, all of which are practically one and the 
same thing. When the world is not at war picric 
acid is used as a dye for silk and wool. 
What TNT is Made Of.—tIn experiments 
made by the British Government, it was found 
that the action of lyddite shells could not always 
be depended on, and that trinitrotoluene, or 
TNT (the first, fourth and ninth letters of the 
big name), as it is popularly called, gave more 
accurate results though it is not as powerful an 
explosive as picric acid. T'NT is made by heat- 
ing nitric acid and. toluene when a reddish sub- 
stance results that is related to benzene, or ben- 
zole, .
-P-A-G-E-114
_ FROM GUNPOWDER TO: TNT 93 
When TNT explodes it forms -water.,.and 
sets carbon, hydrogen and carbon monoxide free, 
hence a dense black smoke is formed... For many 
purposes the smoke is not a disadvantage as, for 
instance, where it is used for the charging of the . 
warhead of a submerged torpedo or filling shells 
that are fired from guns and which explode on 
striking the target. This is made possible be- 
cause T'NT' will not explode by concussion, and 
so there must be some kind of a device which 
will ignite it at the proper time. 
About Detonators and What They Do.— 
There are certain substances which when struck 
a sharp blow will instantly explode, or detonate, 
as it is called. A detonating substance of this 
kind is mercuric fulminate, and it is made by 
heating mercury with nitric acid, and on adding 
alcohol to the solution thus obtained a dense, 
white powder is thrown down. This powder, 
which is mercuric fulminate, is a very unstable 
compound, and it is largely used for firing, by 
shock, such explosives as nitroglycerine and 
smokeless powders, and for igniting black gun- 
powder, TNT and like explosives. 
The fulminate powder after it is dried is mixed 
with gum arabic or some other binder and then 
made into percussion caps. Where large charges 
- of explosives are to be set off, the cap is set inside 
of it, and when the hammer of the detonating
-P-A-G-E-115
94 WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY 
mechanism strikes the cap a pin is driven against 
the mercuric fulminate which explodes it and it 
in turn either fires or explodes the charge. - 
There are several other and newer detonating 
substances and a compound called tetryl, which 
is made of tetranitromethyl aniline, is sometimes 
used instead of mercuric fulminate. Another 
detonating compound that has been used to some 
extent is triazide, which is made from hydrazoic 
acid; this acid is one of the most dangerous ex- 
plosives known, as it explodes without the slight- 
est apparent reason. Finally, the most powerful 
explosive that has yet been made is tetranitro- 
aniline, and this is also used in detonators. 
eace-time E'xplosives—-The uses of explo- 
sives for war purposes were brought home to 
every man, woman and child during the great 
conflict, but there is another less known and more 
important use for them, now that peace reigns 
once more between the nations. In time gone 
by when a wooded land was wanted for farming 
purposes the trees were chopped down and the 
stumps were left to rot away—a method which 
required years. Then came the stump pullers, 
and this was an exceedingly hard and trying or- 
deal for both men and horses. 
Now when wooded land is to be cleared, the 
’ trees are felled and the stumps are blown out 
either with dynamite or some other safe explo-
-P-A-G-E-116
FROM GUNPOWDER TO TNT 95. 
sive.. For road-making and excavating for foun- 
dations explosives also play a prominent part, 
while on the farm they are largely used for mak- 
ing holes for planting trees, and it is now a com- 
mon_practice among farmers and fruit growers to 
use: them for breaking up the soil so that the 
air.can reach it and fertilizers can be mixed 
with it. 
Kinds of Farm Explosives—The difference 
between explosives used in war operations and 
those used in peace-time pursuits is that the lat- 
ter are not so dangerous to handle or so powerful 
as war material. The two chief kinds of 
explosives used for domestic work are. blasting 
powder and dynamite. Blasting powder is noth- 
ing more nor less than black gunpowder, but it is 
not made as carefully or of materials as good as 
" the powder used for sporting and military. guns. 
It is, however, made in small and large grains so 
that the speed with which it burns can be varied, 
and therefore its explosive power can be con- 
trolled. 
A-dozen different blasting powders are made, 
the eomposition of each being the same, but the 
size.of the grains of which range from particles 
almost: as fine as flour to those as large as a bean. 
Where you want to loosen up the soil or break a 
rock into small pieces, a fine-grained powder is 
hile if you want to lift out a stump or 
    
-P-A-G-E-117
96 WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY 
break away a large rock, then you should use a 
coarser grained powder. 
Dynamite is more powerful than blasting pow- 
der and as it was the first of the high explosives 
to be extensively used it was called dynamite 
from the Greek word dynamis, which means 
power. An Italian chemist, Sobrero, first 
discovered nitroglycerine; this he did in 1847, but 
it was so dangerous that it was not used to any 
extent until twenty years after, when Alfred 
Nobel, the Swedish chemist, made it safer to han- 
dle by mixing it with kieselguhr, a kind of sandy 
earth. So popular did it become as a blasting 
agent, that it made the inventor a multimillion- 
aire. Later on, sawdust, flour, magnesia, sodium 
carbonate and other dope, as these inert mate- 
rials are called, took the place of kieselguhr. . By 
varying the proportions of nitroglycerine and the 
dope that is used, different strengths of dynamite 
are obtained. 
In making dynamite, enough dope is mixed 
with the nitrgglycerine to make it about as plas- — 
tic as putty, and it is then pressed into sticks 
about two inches in diameter and eight inches 
long. Each stick is then wrapped in paper and 
paraffined to make it waterproof, when it is ready 
to blast out a few tons of coal or stone or lift a 
stump out bodily by the roots. ,

the early days of blasting, the miners would drill 
a hole in the ore-bearing rock, fill it with black 
powder and then run a thin line of powder, called 
a squib, to a point some distance away; then 
they would light it and run to cover while the 
running was good. While this scheme was not 
very dangerous still it was not any too safe, and 
moreover only one charge could be fired at a 
time. 
An improvement on the squib is the’ safety 
fuse, that is, black gunpowder is twisted up 
in a strip of tape in the same way that the 
fuse of a firecracker is made. One end of the 
fuse is run into the bore-hole filled with powder 
and the other end is ignited. As it burns at 
about the rate of two feet a minute, the men who 
are using it know just how long it will take after 
the free end is ignited for it to reach the charge. 
Two or more charges of blasting powder can be 
fired at practically the same time by using an 
instantaneous fuse; this is so made that it burns 
at the rate of one hundred to three hundred feet 
per second. 
A further improvement is the use of a blasting 
cap-on the end of the fuse, and this is placed in 
the powder-filled bore-hole. .Now when the 
sparks of the fuse reach the cap it explodes vio- 
lently, and this in turn ignites all of the powder at 
the same instant which gives it more power.
-P-A-G-E-119
98 WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY. 
The up-to-date way to fire charges of either 
black powder or dynamite is to employ an elec- 
tric current. By doing so, the charge can be fired 
at exactly the moment desired and any number 
of charges can be exploded at once. Where a 
current is used, an electric squib or a blasting cap 
is connected to the end of a pair of insulated con- 
ducting wires which lead to a blasting machine. 
An electric squib and a blasting cap are alike, 
except that the first has a paper shell and the lat- . 
ter a copper shell. In one end of the shell: is 
placed a small explosive charge and into this a 
pair of insulated wires are run. ‘The ends of the 
wires are connected with a very fine wire, called 
a bridge, and when a current passes through it 
- the fine wire is heated and so ignites the charge. 
The blasting machine is a small electric gener- 
ator that is driven by hand power. It is made 
like the magneto of a motor car engine. The re- 
volving element, which is called an armature, has 
a pinion, that is a small toothed wheel on it; a 
rack, which is a straight rod with teeth cut in it, 
meshes with the pinion. Now when a current is 
needed to fire the blasting cap, all that the blas- 
ter‘ needs to do is to push down, firmly and 
quickly, on the handle.

most familiar is the land, as the more or less solid 
part of the earth’s surface is called, and as we 
live on ‘and from it, it is worth while to find out

the fierce heat.of the sun and the intense cold of 
the glacial epochs, with the result that their com-

it up, sometimes into giant boulders and at others 
into grains of sand. Thus it was that various 
kinds of land were made, and the process is still 
going on and will continue to go on to the end of 
the world. 
The Various Kinds of Land.—Now the rock 
that forms the crust of the earth is of various

kinds because different parts of it are formed of 
different elements which have united and pro- 
‘ duced them; thus granite is a very hard rock and 
is composed of feldspar, mica and quartz. Feld- 
spar and mica in turn consist of silicate of alumi- 
num and some of the alkaline metals like potas- 
sium, while quartz is silicon dioxide. Sand is 
, formed by the union of silicon and oxygen, and 
| sandstone is sand cemented together, while mar- 
ble and limestone are formed chiefly of calcium 
carbonate. 
As these various kinds of rock were sub jected to air and water and heat and cold, they pro- 
duced a variety of land, the first of which is formed by the rock itself, the second is formed of 
sand, and the third is formed of clay. Then a fourth type of land is formed by a mixture of clay and sand, while on top of much of the land, 
or mixed with it; is the decayed animal and vege- 
table matter that has been accumulating through the countless centuries. It is this latter material 
that covers the land, or is mixed with it, that we are interested in, for this is the soil which makes it possible for plant life to flourish. 
What is In the Soil—The decayed animal and vegetable matter is called humus, and it is this substance that makes the kind of rich soil which is known as loam. Not only does the humus contain the chief substances on which
-P-A-G-E-122
  HOW PLANTS LIVE AND GROW 101 
plants live, but it holds the water and. supplies it 
to the plants as they need it. 
A soil of whatever kind contains many ele- 
ments, but those that are absolutely needed for 
plant food are nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, 
sulphur, calcium, magnesium and iron, together 
with carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen from the air 
and water. If any one of these ten elements is 
missing a plant cannot grow. Virgin soil, that 
is a soil which has never been used for growing 
plant foods before, contains all the above mineral 
elements, hence, for several years it will yield 
large crops. But after a time some of the 
elements, usually the nitrogen, phosphorus or 
potash, or all of them, become exhausted and the 
plants, deprived of a part of their food, will grow 
very poorly or not at all. This is the reason why 
farmers rotate their crops and use fertilizers. wn 
The: Action of Air on the Soil—tIn raising 
crops, then, it is necessary to put back into the 
soil atleast as much of the nitrogen, and other 
elements, as the plants have taken out of it for 
food, and this is one of the purposes of plowing 
and harrowing it. In this way the particles of 
the soi] are loosened, allowing the air to circulate 
through it. In doing so, the oxygen comes into 
contact with the vegetable matter of which the 
humus is composed, and it is converted into solu- 
ble nitrogen’ compounds and phosphoric acid
-P-A-G-E-123
102 WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY. 
compounds. At the same time the carbon dioxide 
which is produced by decaying matter is caught 
by the water in the soil, and helps to render 
soluble some of the mineral matter. 
The Action of Water on the Soil—Plants 
cannot use gases, salts and acids direct for food, 
but these elements and compounds must be dis- 
solved in water first. ‘They are then in such con- 
dition that the plants can easily draw. them 
through their roots, up and through their stalks 
and into their leaves. To do this, the roots, stalks 
and leaves of every plant are made up of little 
tubes called capillaries, and it is by and through 
these that the liquid foods are carried upward by 
capillary attraction, which is the same curious 
force that causes the oil in a lamp to “ soak up” 
from the lower end of a wick dipping into it to 
the upper end, where it is lit. Since’ plants, like 
animals, are made up of three-fourths water, the 
soil supplies this amount to them while they are _ 
growing, as well ds foods which are dissolved

How the Soil is Kept Fertile—Nitrogen is 
ae of the elements of which plants use large 
aantities for food, and after the original amount 
iat the soil contains has been ‘exhausted it must 
pe replaced or the crop will fail. Now there are 
‘a number of ways by which this can be done, as, 
for instance, by rotating the crops, planting
-P-A-G-E-124
HOW PLANTS LIVE AND GROW 108 
clover, or other leguminous crops, and using ‘fer- 
tilizers. 
The Rotation of Crops——In the early days of 
farming it was found that where a crop of wheat 
was planted in the same field year after year the 
- soil soon lost its productive power, though the 
reason it did so was probably not known. Later 
it was learned that if two very different crops 
_were planted alternately both grew to much bet- 
ter advantage and this scheme of planting was 
called a two year rotation. Further experiment- 
_showed that when three different kinds of crops 
were planted in succession still better results 
were had, and this was known as a three year ro- 
tation, and, finally, it was found that when 
wheat, turnips, barley and clover were planted 
one after the other the soil produced good crops 
of each of them; this is known as the Ni orfolk, or 
four year rotation, and is widely used in all farm- 
ing countries. 
The Fixation of Nitrogen by Bacteria—The 
rotation’ of crops is based on the fact that wheat 
and other cereals take the nitrogen from the soil, 
while clover, cow-peas and the like give it back to 
the soil, The way these plants and other 
legumes produce nitrogen is thus: On their 
roots grow tubercles, or nodules, that -is, little 
swellings, formed of bacteria, a kind of living or- 
ganiism: so small that to see one | of them you

"would have ‘to use ,a high-power inicroscope. 
Now these bacteria do not harm the ‘plants and 
_ they have the very good quality of being able to’ 
take the nitrogen that is in the air and fiz it, that 
is, they make it combine with sodium, or other 
elements, and so form soluble nitrates: When 
the plants die the fixed.nitrogen remains behind 
in the soil. where it is ready: to be used by the 
next crop of cereals. . 
Natural and Artificial Fertilizers. While the 
scheme of rotating the crops is of great value in 
keeping up the nitrogen and other elements of 
the soil that are needed to make plants grow, still 
it does not provide a large enough quantity of 
any of them to secure the. best results. This is    
° why ‘fertilizers, that is substances which contain 
nitrogen, phosphates and potash, are so largely 
“used. A: good fertilizer is one that contains all 
' -Of the above substarices in such a state that they 
can be easily dissolved out by the water in the 
- soil, and, therefore, can be readily assimilated by 
. plants for food. 
:.. There are two chief kinds of fertilizers, and 
these are natural fertilizers, that is those that are 
the by+product: of animals and other: natural 
sources, and artificial fertilizers, or those that are - 
manufactured for the purpose. Of the natural 
fertilizers barnyard manure was the first to be 
used, and as it is rich in nitrogen it is very. valu-

   itis. mixed with the soil the vegetable matter oe 
keeps’ the particles of the soil separated:and this... 
allows the air to circulate freely through itl. 
Another kind of natural manure that is exten-.~ 
sively used is guano; this is the excrement of 's€a- 
birds that lived on the coast of Peru in South, 
America, and with which is mixed the dead 
bodies of the birds themselves and the remains of 
fish on which they fed. Because guano con- 
tains nitrogen, phosphates and potash—the three - 
chief foods required by plants—it is called a com- 
plete fertilizer. It was first used in England ~ 
about the beginning of 1800 and in the United 
‘States a quarter of a century later. The guano 
deposits of Peru are enormous, and while twenty 
million tons have already been taken out there is 
a bed of it left that is thirty feet thick. 
Dry ground fish, or fish scrap, as it is calléd, is 
also used as a fertilizer for soils where the nitro- 
- gen has been exhausted. Every year enormous 
amounts of a kind of fish called porgy, or men- 
haden, are caught to make fish-oil.. Formerly 
after the oil was pressed out of the fish their 
bodies were thrown away, but later it was discov- 
ered that they contained nearly ten per cent of 
nitrogen. A new industry immediately sprang 
’ into-existence and the remains of the fish which. 
were discarded as waste were now dried out and 
  
-P-A-G-E-129
106 WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY 
ground up into a meal and sold as a fertilizer 
under the name of dry fish scrap. Some of the 
dried fish is treated with sulphuric acid, and 
this is sold under the name of wet acid scrap. 
Of artificial fertilizers there are many kinds, 
so that every condition of soil can be taken care 
of and suitably enriched for the crop that is to be 
planted. Chief among these are fertilizers which _ 
contain large amounts of nitrogen. Sodium ni- 
trate, or Chili saltpeter, is a compound brought 
from Chili in enormous quantities, and in its 
crude state it contains from two to five per cent 
of nitrogen. 
It is then refined, when light-colored crystals 
are formed and these often contain as high as fif- 
teen per cent of nitrogen. Since it dissolves 
very easily in water it is readily absorbed by 
plants, and as it will make two blades of grass 
grow where only one would grow before it is 
very much in demand as a fertilizer for lawns. 
In order to make it spread evenly it should be 
thoroughly mixed with twice its bulk of earth. 
A nitrogenous fertilizer that is largely used is 
ammonium sulphate. When coal gas is made it’ 
is passed through a solution of sulphuric acid, 
that is sulphuric acid and water, to rid it of the 
ammonia gas; the ammonia gas dissolves in the. 
acidulated water and forms what is called ammo- 
niacal liquor, and it is from this solution that am--
-P-A-G-E-130
HOW. PLANTS LIVE AND GROW 107 | 
monium sulphate is obtained. This salt has a 
grayish-yellow color and contains nearly, twenty 
per cent of nitrogen. 
In the early days of gas lighting, ammonium 
sulphate was considered a mere by-product, but 
when the chemistry of the soi] came to be a recog- 
nized factor in farming, because of its high nitro- 
gen content, it took its place as an important fer- 
tilizing compound, And not only is it used as a 
fertilizer but also as the basis of making, that is 
the beginning, of a large number of ammonium 
compounds. , 
The very latest nitrogen fertilizer is calcium 
cyanamid, or cyanamid, as it is called for short, 
or lime-nitrogen, or nitrolim, as it is often ealled. 
The making of cyanamid is another process for 
drawing nitrogen from the air. 
Not more than ten years ago motor-cars were 
equipped with acetylene gas lighting apparatus. 
To make acetylene gas, water. was allowed to 
drip slowly on a compound called calcium car- 
bide. ‘This compound is an electric furnace 
product and it was discovered by Caro and 
Franke in 1895; the process of making it will be 
described in the chapter on Electric Furnace 
Products, which you will find further on. It is 
enough here ta say that when a stream of nitrogen 
obtained from the air is blown across a bed of 
red- -hot calcium carbide, they will combing  
-P-A-G-E-131
108 WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY 
chemically and form calcium cyanamid and 
carbon. 
The calcium cyanamid contains | one molecule 
of calcium carbide and two molecules of nitro- 
gen, so you can see that cyanamid is rich in nitro- 
gen. The cyanamid thus obtained, however, 
contains too many other substances to be used as 
a fertilizer and these must be removed from it 
before it is mixed with the soil. Among the im- 
purities are carbides, phosphates and sulphides, 
and when the air and the water of the soil react 
on these they set free gases which are very harm- 
ful to growing plants. These impurities are re- 
moved by a refining process, when the cyanamid 
can be safely used. But even then the nitrogen 
in it is not immediately dissolved by the water in 
the soil as is sodium nitrate; instead, the process 
is slower and the nitrogen in it is first changed 
into other compounds of ammonium which are 
easily dissolved and can be absorbed by the plants 
for food. 
The Phosphate Fertilizers——Phosphorus is 
the strangest of all elements. The old alche- 
mists knew how to make it and because it glows in 
the dark they nicknamed it the son of Satan. 
Long before it. was supposed to have been dis- 
covered by Brandt in 1669, an Italian alchemist, 
Prince San Severo, treated human skulls with 
various acids and then burned them in a furnace.
-P-A-G-E-132
   poi gh 
HOW PLANTS LIVE AND GROW 109 
The product apparently burned for months with- 
out’ loss-of weight and it gave forth a ghostly 
light. The ‘Prince called it a perpetual lamp, 
and for a long time he would not divulge the se- 
cret as he intended his family vault to be the only 
one to be illumined by it. As bones are treated 
with sulphuric acid and calcined in the prepara- 
tion of phosphorus at the present time there is 
little doubt but that the Prince had hit upon the 
process of making it. 
Now although phosphorus is very poisonous 
and its vapor causes terrible ulcerations of the 
human body, each grown person has nearly two 
pounds of it in his system, and this is enough to 
make several thousand friction matches. The 
human. body also contains quite an amount of 
sulphur, but fortunately there is not enough of 
the latter element to start a fire. Phosphorus is 
‘so essential to the brain that many people eat fish 
on days other than Friday to make them brainy, 
and.from this comes the ancient saying, “No 
phosphorus, no brains.” 
Compounds containing phosphorus are found 
in small amounts in rocks, and as these are broken 
up to form the land, it finds its way into the soil, 
where it is dissolved and absorbed by various 
plants and finally helps to build up grains such 
as wheat; corn and oats. Then when you eat 
bread,, eorm-cakes or oatmeal the phosphorus in

them is taken into your body and helps.to make 
your bones as well as your brains. 
Fertilizers containing phosphorus are, there- 
fore, quite as necessary to plant growth as is ni- 
trogen. Since both rocks and bones contain 
phosphorus there are, naturally, two sources 
from which it can be obtained. Fertilizers made 
from the first are called mineral phosphates, and 
those made from the second are termed animal 
phosphates. The phosphorus in minerals is 
locked up in the form of calcium phosphate while 
that in bones is mixed with other compounds. 
‘Calcium phosphate is a salt and as it will not dis- 
solve in water readily it must be treated with 
sulphuric acid before it is mixed with the soil. 
Mineral phosphates contain a very large percent- 
age of phosphorus, while bone phosphates con- 
tain about two-thirds as much. 
If you will turn back to the chapter on Old 
Metals and New Alloys you will find that when 
steel is made in a Bessemer converter slag is left 
behind. This contains a compound of phos- 
phorus that will dissolve in water and, different 
from mineral and animal phosphates, it can be 
used on the soil without being treated with acid. 
This kind of fertilizer is called Thomas slag or 
phosphate slag. 
Since it takes a long time for the phosphoric 
acid in both mineral and animal phosphates to
-P-A-G-E-134
  - HOW PLANTS LIVE AND GROW 111 
dissolve in the water of the soil, both kinds are 
often ground up and mixed with warm sulphuric 
acid; this treatment renders the phosphoric acid 
soluble and forms calcium sulphate which will 
not dissolve in water. These substances are not 
removed from the rock or bone but the whole 
mass is ground to a fine powder. ‘Because of the 
ease with which the phosphoric acid is dissolved 
out by the water of the soil it is called superphos- 
phate fertilizer. 
The Potash Fertilizers.—The starting point.of 
potash fertilizers is a compound of potassium, a 
silvery-white wonder metal, which is so soft it 
ean be cut with a knife, and so light it will float on 
water. It likes oxygen so well that to keep them 
from uniting it must be placed in naphtha or 
some other oil which does not contain oxygen. 
Potassium compounds are contained in rocks 
everywhere and when these are broken up or 
worn away they go into the soil where they become 
food for plants, and it is from these that we get a 
‘small part of our supply of potash. 
When the metal potassium and oxygen unite | 
they form potash, and plants contain not only 
potash but tartaric, oxalic and other acids. To 
get.the potash out of plants the wood of the lat- 
ter is burned, when the heat decomposes the wood, 
“and the carbon diowide combines with the potas- 
sium owide and forms potassium. carbonate ‘and
-P-A-G-E-135
112. WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY 
this is a part of the ashes that are left. The 
ashes are now dumped into a barrel, which has a 
hole in it near the bottom, and every day a bucket 
of water is poured into it; as this seeps through 
the ashes it dissolves out the potassium carbonate, 
or potash as it is called, and on reaching the hole 
the solution, which is now called lye, runs off into 
a bucket. This process is called leaching. Fi- 
nally the water is evaporated leaving crystals 
behind and these are potassium carbonate. 
In the olden times when nearly everyone 
burned wood the above process produced practi- 
eally all of the potash used, but about fifty years 
ago great beds of potash were opened up at 
Stassfurt, Germany, and practically all of the 
' world’s supply of the salt has since come from 
' this source. The potash deposits of Stassfurt 
were formed by the sea water which at one time 
flowed and ebbed over the district where the pot- 
ash beds now are. The potash came into the sea, 
along with other salts, by the breaking up of the 
rocks which originally contained it, and as the sea 
washed forth and back it formed layer after layer 
of potash and so built up the enormous beds 
which are now being worked. 
There are two kinds of potash salts that are 
used for fertilizing purposes, and these are potas- 
siwm chloride and potassium sulphate. The 
crude potassium chloride is generally called mu--

common name of potassium sulphate is. sulphate 
of potassium. In using these potash fertilizers 
care must be taken not to put the chloride on the 
soil where potatoes, tobacco or sugar beets are to 
be grown, for it hinders instead of helps them. 
The sulphate, while more expensive, is not harm- 
ful to crops of any kind. .

TI’ is curious how little the average person 
_knows about the things he eats, wears and uses. 
“Take, for instance, the commodity we call sugar. 
He knows that it is sweet and will sweeten his 
beverages and edibles; that the price of it was 
twenty-seven cents a pound during the war, that 
it is five or six cents a’ pound now, and that out 
chief supply comes from Cuba. But when it

of them. Ree SOE 
‘About Cane Sugar.—There are various kinds 
of sweet substances .which go by the common 
name of sugar, but that which we use for sweet- 
ening our tea and coffee, cereals, cakes and many . 
other drinkables and edibles is called cané sugar, 
or, to give it its chemical name, sucrose. Of

  en Cr before the Christian | era the 
s had sugar cane and they also had honey, 
and as the sap of the cane and strained honey 
tasted very much alike, they called the former 
honey of canes. To give credit where it-is due, 
the honey bees were the first makers of sugar, but. 
as they mixed it up with other substances, it, was 
not exactly suitable for sweetening things in 
eral, and, again, they couldn’t make it fast 
enough to supply the demand. 
". $d gugar cane, which first grew in India, was 
cultivated there for many centuries for the sweet 
' sap-there was in it, but it was not until six or 
ven hundred years B. c., that the East Indian 
hrned the knack of boiling it and making a 
"syrup, or molasses, of it which would keep. 
Then it was that the sweet product of the cane 
became an article of trade, and it was used from 
that! time on by all of the nations of the earth. 
But it took another fifteen hundred years before 
the human race learned how to make solid sugar 
out. of the sap. . When Columbus made his sec- 
ond Voyage he took sugar cane from the Canary 
- Islands to San Domingo, and from the latter 
' place the plant was introduced into Cuba and’ 
other West Indian islands where the soil is par- 
ticularly adapted fer growing it. It also soon

World depended almost entirely on the New 
World for its supply of sugar. : 
“Sugar cane grows from six to twelve feet high 
and the stalks are a little larger across than a 
broom-handle. A crop is cut twice a year, then 
taken to the mills and ground, that is it.is run 
between rollers which press every particle ‘of 
sap out of the stalks. As soon as the sap-is ob- 
tained a little milk of lime is added to it to pre- 
yent it from getting sour. The lime does this by 
using up the acids that are in it and separating 
_ the albumens out of it. The excess lime is then 
gotten rid of by precipitating it, in turn, with 
carbon dioxide. The solid matter that is 
thrown down, or precipitated, is removed frd 
the sugar solution by filtering it in a press. 
“The purified sugar sap is next poured into 
vacuum pans, that is pans from which the air is 
exhausted, and heated so that it boils at a temper- 
ature so low it cannot possibly burn. This boil- 
ing process causes the water to evaporate until a 
thick jelly results and when this is allowed to cool 
the sugar, which is of a brown color, crystallizes 
out of it and leaves molasses, which is: called 
mother-liquor, behind. The brown sugar is then 
placed in a centrifugal machine’* which thor-

mae chemist, found that beets contained considerable 
sucrosé.. ‘From the white beet he obtained a:

beet he got a little less than five per cent, Here, 
then, was a new source of sugar that would make 
the Old World independent of the New World 
for its supply, but it was fifty years after Marg-. 
graf’s discovery ere sugar from beets was actu- 
ally manufactured on a commercial scale. By 
this time sugar was in great demand, and the 
faster it was produced the more the world wanted 
of it, with the result that to-day sugar made from 
cane and sugar made from beets are running 
neck and neck in a wild race to supply enough 
to go around. 
The first sugar to be extracted from the sap of 
the maple tree was the result of an experiment 
by a New England colonist in the year of 1752. 
While it is not a universal sweetening agent like 
sugar made from cane and beets, it certainly is 
‘good when eaten either as a candy or a syrup. 
The manufacture of maple sugar is carried on in 
the spring of the year wherever sugar maple trees _ 
grow, as that is the time when the sap rises and 
peo HS more freely.

zamphor as we know it is in the form of a gum 
which is really a solid essential oil. It is found 
in many plants but it can be extracted in-com- 
mercial quantities only from the Camphor 
Laurel, a tree that flourishes in Japan, China 
and Formosa. There was a time, and that not 
more than a dozen years ago, when all the 
camphor we used was imported into this country 
from the Island of Formosa. For many years 
the entire camphor output of the Far East was 
controlled by the Japanese Government, and as 
the demand for the product grew greater with 
each succeeding year, the price of it was raised 
until it was so expensive as to be almost pro- 
hibitive. Then the chemists set to work to make 
it out of turpentine and other substances—that is 
synthetically, but this is another story which will 
be told later. 
Natural camphor gum is made from camphor 
trees which are chopped down, cut up into small 
pieces and with the roots and leaves are distilled 
with water. As the vapors rise they are made 
to come in contact with and condense on rice 
straw and in this way the crude camphor gum is 
obtained. By distillation is meant that a liquid 
or a solid-is changed into vapors by heat and the 
yapors are then cooled off, when they again take i

on a liquid or solid form. The crude camphor 
gum is refined, that is the impurities in it are 
gotten rid of, by sublimation, which means that 
the vapors are made to take on a solid form with- 
ont liquifying first. 
Camphor is a compound substance formed of 
rbon, hydrogen and oxygen (CyH,.O). If 
u put some gum camphor into a bottle it will 
vaporize and form delicate crystals on the side of 
the glass on which the light shines. When water 
is added to spirits of camphor, which is made by 
dissolving gum camphor in alcohol, the camphor 
will be precipitated, that is thrown down in a fine 
powder. If you have ever tried to powder cam- 
” ghor you know that it is not an easy thing to do, 
Gu: if you moisten it with a few drops of alcohol 
you can do so very easily. 
Now here is a simple and very curious experi- 
ment: Pour some clean water into a soup plate, 
throw a few pieces of camphor into it and light 
them. As each piece burns forces act on it which 
make ‘it rotate and gyrate. ina very strange and 
erratic manner. .

sults that is called collodion. In the old. days of 
wet-plate photography the glass plates were — 
coated with collodion just before they’ were made 
sensitive to the light by immersing them in a sil- » 
ver solution. Collodion is still used in photog- _ 
raphy, but instead of pouring it on a glass plate 
it is made into thin sheets which will not break, by 
pouring it on slabs and letting the ether evapo- 
rate. The sheets are then coated with a silver 
emulsion that is sensitive to light. . 
Now when guncotton and gum camphor are 
chemically combined they form a hard, white ex- 
plosive substance that is not used for farm blast- 
ing or again for military guns, but for making all 
manner of useful objects that have very much the 
appearance of ivory but which is finer grained 
- and, in some respects, more beautiful. Since 
celluloid is explosive, iffa lighted match or other 
flame comes in contact with an object made of 
this compound, it will burn up in a flash. The 
danger of celluloid objects going up in smoke 
has been removed in the product sold under the 
trade name of pyralin, and this compound is now 
made up into the most beautiful toilet sets that 
the art of the designer and the skill of the manu- | 
facturer have yet produced. .

it, it was discovered nearly shaty years ago. The 
story of its discovery is interesting, as is the story 
of all other inventions and discoveries. 
[7 The first efforts to produce celluloid were 
‘made by Alexander Parks, of England, in 1855. 
In his experiments to harden the dissolved gun- | 
cotton to the proper degree he mixed it with 
many substances, including camphor, and to 
make the compound plastic, in order to be able 
_ . to mold it, he mixed it with castor oil. The ar- 
ticles he made of it were called parkesine, but as 
both heat and cold had an untoward effect on 
them they were not a success, and after ten years 
of hard experimental work Parks gave up the at- 
tempt. 
Working with Parks was a young man named. 
Daniel Spill, who believing he could make a du- 
rable and temperature resisting product went 
to work on the problem. Finally he turned out 
a compound called wylonite, and while it was an 
improvement on parkesine, still it contained cas- 
tor oil and so it had the same defects as parkesine 
though not to so great an extent. So ended the 
race for celluloid in England. : 
In the early sixties and for many years after 
type was set by hand, and the typesetters used to 
put collodion on their fingers to prevent: them 
from getting raw. When brushed over a ‘sur-. 
face collodion forms a thin elastic film, and you

can buy it to-day for covering cuts on your fin- 
gers under the name of New Skin. Now it just - 
so happened that John Wesley Hyatt, who was a. — 
typesetter during the Civil War period, intended . 
to put some collodion on his fingers, when he 
found the bottle upset and its contents run out. | 
Instead of a liquid or a viscous substance remain- 
ing, the ether had evaporated from it and left a 
sheet of solid material which in a way resembled 
ivory. Here was a compound that looked ‘to 
young Hyatt as though it might be used for - 
making billiard balls and other articles which had - 
heretofore been made of costly ivory. 
But alas and alack-a-day! when he tried to’ 
mold collodion he found that instead of expand- 
ing when it cooled, like iron or type-metal, it con- ~ 
tracted to such an extent that it no longer bore 
a resemblance to the original object. Hyatt 
tried again (and if the truth were known he 
probably tried many hundreds of times) until, 
finally, he hit upon the secret of successfully 
combining guncotton and camphor without hav- 
ing first to dissolve them; this he did by simply 
heating them together in molds and applying 
pressure to them, when a third substance, which 
a7 Ban tet and more elastic than ivory, 
thus was born the remarkable 
now as celluloid.

like celluloid it has made experimenters travel a 
long way. When Columbus made his second 
voyage to the New World he recorded the inci- 
dent of seeing the natives of Haiti (Hispaniola) 
playing with rubber balls (though, of course, he 
did not use the word rubber, as this was a word 
of later coinage). Then in 1685 Juan de Tor- 
quemada, a traveller who had returned to Spain 
- from Mexico, told of a tree he had seen in the 
latter country which yielded a sap (rubber) and 
of which the natives fashioned shoes. The first 
scientific record of rubber was made by La Con- 
damine in 1736 who obtained some of it on a voy- 
age up the Amazon River and on returning to 
France he presented samples of it to the French 
Academy. 
a Condamine, or some other Frenchman, 
. gave it the name of caoutchouc (pYrorreuneed 
cew-chuk). This tough old name came from the 
word caucho, which was used in Brazil to mean a 
certain kind of rubber tree. Going farther back, 
caucho was derived from caa, which is the native 
word for wood and o-chw which is their way of 
saying to weep. Thus caucho in their language 
is literally a tree that weeps, by which they mean 
that rubber tears run out of it. 
It was Joseph Priestley, a famous chemist of 
his day in England, who first called it rubber— 
a simple name that has stuck to it ever since, and

this is the way it came about, . He obtained some 
of it in 1770, and the only use he could find for it 
was to rub out lead pencil marks, and that it was 
a luxury in his time is shown by his. statement 
that “its cost being three shillings (75 cents) for ” 
a cubical piece of about half-an-inch.” : 
In 1823 Mackintosh, of Glasgow, Scotland, es- 
tablished a works where he made cloth water- 
proof by placing a layer of rubber between two 
layers of cloth, and Mackintosh is still a word to 
conjure with in wet weather. Then in 1825 rub- 
ber overshoes were imported from Para, Brazil, 
  L& but they were next to useless, for they melted-in 
summer, and cracked in winter.

‘the goal many experimenters were striving 
6x, but the efforts of all of them save one led to 
naught. Charles Goodyear, of Connecticut, was 
the lucky discoverer. The veryjyear that he was 
born, that is in 1800, the first raw rubber was 
brought into the United States. He began ex- 
perimenting with it when he was twenty-eight 
years old, and after ten years of laborious effort 
and poverty he finally hit upon the secret of mak- 
ing it elastic and durable. : 
He accidentally found that when rubber and 
sulphur were heated together a new compound 
resulted which was tougher and more elastic than 
the raw rubber and would neither get sticky nor

ess of treating raw rubber when mixed with, sul 
phur Goodyear called vulcanization. Further 
experimenting showed that by varying. the 
amount of sulphur for a given quantity of raw 
rubber as well as subjecting these to different 
temperatures, rubber could be made very soft and 
elastic or exceedingly hard and brittle. ~ : 
Rubber, that is raw rubber, is obtained by tap- 
ping rubber trees which grow abundantly in 
_ South America and Africa, when the: sap runs out 
of them and is collected in cups. Rubber trees . 
are tapped i in different ways but the spiral groove. 
‘method is one that is much in favor. In this 
method several spiral grooves are cut around ‘the -

it is caught. When the sap comes from the tree

CELLULOSE AND OTHER FIBERS 
TEextite Materiats 
Ctors goods and fabrics in general are made 
of fibers, that is fine hair-like materials which are 
obtained from plants and animals. We get the 
fibers of plants that are used chiefly from cotton 
and flav, and the fibers of animals include those 
that we obtain almost wholly from sheep and 
silkworms. But there are also artificial vege- 
table fibers made, as well as imitation animal 
fibers, as you will presently see. 
Cotton and Cotton Fibers——While cotton did 
not provide the first covering for the nakedness 
of man, it is known to have been used in India 
and Egypt a thousand years before the begin- 
ning of the Christian era and fabrics were un- 
doubtedly woven of it long, long before that 
time, and it is the most important fiber that we 
now have. “There are several varieties of the cot- 
ton plant and all of these belong to the family 
that is known by the name of gossypium. It 
grows as a shrub and its leaves are dotted here

and there with black spots. The flowers look 
something like those of the hollyhock whieh be- 
longs to the same family; the flowers are of dif- 
ferent colors but are usually white or pale yellow. 
The base of the flowers have purple spots on 
them and heart-shaped bracts’ encircle them: As 
the plant matures, each flower on it changes to a 
round cellular ball, called a boll, and this is the 
fruit; it contains seeds and these are surrounded. 
by beautiful soft hair-like fibers. .. 
These cotton fibers are hollow and before the 
seeds get ripe they are filled with living cells, or 
protoplasm, as it is called. When the seeds 
ripen the protoplasm dries up and the fibers. be- 
gin to flatten and twist, when the boll is forced 
open and the fibers are revealed; the cotton 
is then ready to be picked. The picking usu- 
ally begins in August and often lasts up until 
December, or until frost comes. For this work 
everybody on the plantation who is old enough to 
be out of the cradle and young enough to be out 
of the grave is called on to help. Before the be- 
ginning of the nineteenth century the seeds had - 
to be separated from the cotton, after it was 
picked, by hand, which was a very slow and 
tedious operation as a person could clean only 
about a pound of it a day. But in 1793 Eli

Whitney invented the cotton gin and it not only 
does the work quickly but far better than it can 
be done by hand. / 
As the fibers have an elastic twist they are not 
only easy to spin but when spun they make a 
strong thread. The fibers vary in diameter from 
1/600 to 1/1200 of an inch and are formed of 
’ cellulose. Since the cotton plant is a tender’ 
one it must be grown in a soil adapted to it and 
the climate must be warm and moist; these con- 
ditions. are found in the Southern States, espe- 
cially along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, and the 
finest cotton comes from this part of the country, 
The two chief kinds of cotton raised down south 
are Sea Island and Egyptian cotton; Sea Island 
cotton is always pure and white, and Egyptian 
cotton has a slight yellowish color, and it is the 
latter that is used for balbriggan underwear, and 
other cotton garments. 
What Cellulose Is.—Cellulose is a wonderful 
compound whose molecules are formed of six 
atoms of carbon, ten atoms of hydrogen and five 
' atoms of oxygen. If you will take your knife 
and split the branch of a tree, or the stalk of a 
smaller pl@nt, in two, and then look at it through 
a microscope of fair power you will see that it is 
built up of fibers, and around these are packed 
other compounds. Closer examination will show 
that the fibers are built up of cells and these are
-P-A-G-E-158
  CELLULOSE 181 
in turn formed of cellulose. It is these cells that 
give the plants their strength and rigidity. 
Cellulose differs in various plants and in dif- 
ferent parts of the same plant as far as its 
physical characteristics are concerned, but it al- 
ways has the same chemical composition. For 
instance, in the bran of cereals it is so soft that 
you ean digest it; in cotton and flax it is soft, 
Jong and hair-like; in elder-pith and cork it is 
short; light and springy; in the stalks of plants it 
is more or less soft and porous, while in trees it 
is harder and packed more closely together. The 
uses of cellulose are exceedingly diverse. In 
building houses, making furniture, weaving 
cloth, twisting rope, spinning thread, or pressing 
paper, thé strength is due to the fibers. 
These uses of cellulose are all old and well 
known, but in recent years it has been extensively 
employed in making nitrates, sulphates and 
benzoates and this is done by treating it with 
acids and various other compounds. When thus 
acted on, the composition of cellulose is usually 
' changed, but in some cases it is merely dissolved 
and not decomposed; if such a cellulose mixture 
is further treated it results in a sticky com- 
pound whose consistency is about that of liquid 
glue. 
Artificial Coiton.—Cellulose obtained from 
wood Papi is very cheap as against that of cotton,
-P-A-G-E-159
182 WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY 
and by treating the former it can be.made into 
threads, or wood-pulp yarn as it is called. A 
_ way to make a coarser yarn is to take narrow 
strips of paper that have been made from wood 
pulp and twist them. Such yarns are made into 
twine or woven into coarse fabrics which are 
used on walls and floors. A better fabric is made 
by weaving wood-pulp yarns with threads of cot- 
ton, flax and other plant fibers, and it is cheap 
and has good wearing qualities. These artificial 
cotton fabrics are sold under the trade names of 
lincella, textitose, aylolin, silvalin, ete. 
Mercerized Cotton.—Ordinary cotton cloth 
that has been treated to give it a silky luster is 
known as mercerized cotton. It is so called after 
John Mercer, a calico-printer of Lancashire, who 
discovered how to make it in 1844, His process 
consists of treating ordinary cotton goods with a 
strong solution of caustic soda when it is changed 
into a compound known as alkali cellulose. The 
action of the soda on the goods makes it shrink 
about one-fourth of its original length. It is 
then stretched back, when the fibers are untwisted 
and made smooth which gives them a silky luster. 
The fabric is then washed when the fibers are 
changed into cellulose hydrate which makes them 
thicker and stronger than ordinary cotton. 
Artificial Silks —There are several kinds of 
artificial silk but all of them differ from artificial

cotton in that the cellulose of the ‘cotton :is 
changed into a thick liquid, or viscous compound, : 
which is then forced out of fine glass tubes: with 
drawn points like the spinnerets of a silkworm 
when: silk-like threads are produced: ’ Artificial 
silk differs from real silk in that cellulose is a | 
vegetable compound, and silk is an animal prod- 
uct. There are several distinct’ processes for 
making artificial silk but the chief ones yield 
pyroxylin silk, cwprammonium silk. and. viscose 
silk. 
Pyroaylin. Silk—In this process, which was 
invented by Count Hilaire de Chardonnet, the 
cotton is treated with nitric acid which changes it 
into nitrocellulose, that is guncotton. (See. 
Chapter VII.) The guncotton is now dissolved 
in ether and alcohol when collodion results. (See 
Chapter XIII.) The collodion is then forced 
through little glass tubes whose jets are almost 
microscopic in size, and as the thread, or fila- 
ment, comes forth the air causes the ether and 
alcohol'to evaporate from it and a fine, smooth 
and lustrous thread is formed which is then 
wound on reels like silk froma cocoon. As these 
threads are highly inflammable they have to be 
treated with a solution of ammonium sulphide 
which extracts the nitrates that are in them and 
changes the nitrocellulose back into a compound 
that looks very much like real silk. 
 
-P-A-G-E-161
184 WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY; 
Cuprammonium Silk.—In making this kind of 
silk, which is also called Pauly’s silk after its in- 
ventor, the cellulose is dissolved in a solution of 
cuprammonium, that is a solution of copper oa- 
tde in ammonia; now when this solution ‘has been 
_ neutralized by an acid the cellulose is precipi- 
tated, that is it is thrown down, in the form of a 
gelatin-like substance. ‘This cellulose solution is 
then forced through glass jets, as described 
above, and the threads made to pass through a 
solution of dilute sulphuric acid; the acid gets rid 
of the copper in the thread which is again 
practically pure cellulose. 
Viscose Silk.—Still another artificial silk is 
that produced by the viscous process which is due 
to Cross and Bevan. The viscous solution is 
made by treating cellulose with a strong solution 
of caustic soda when the fibers are mercerized, 
as described in the paragraph on Mercerized 
Cotton. The cellulose thus treated is then put 
into carbon disulphide, when a tawny-colored- 
substance results, and when this is mixed -with 
water it swells up like a sponge and then dis- 
solves entirely. This liquid is now heated and a 
little acid is added to it, when a precipitate is 
thrown down which is cellulose, but this time it is 
in the form of a yielding, tremulous mass which. 
goes by the name of viscose. 
The viscose is then forced ‘through glass tubes :
-P-A-G-E-162

as before described, but instead of passing the 
threads through an acid solution they are. sus- 
pended in a current. of warm air in such .a way 
that their own weight stretches them, and a8 
they dry: they are changed back into cellulose. 
While the sheen of cellulose silk is as great-or 
greater than that of real silk and it dyes more 
easily than cotton, the chief fault to be found with: 
it so far has been that it loses its strength when 
it gets wet, though when it dries again it seems 
as strong as ever. Viscose silk is the nearest ap- 
proach to natural silk that has yet been produced 
as it has a luster that compares favorably with. 
real silk and is nearly as strong. The greatest 
difficulty lies in its manufacture, as it is next to 
impossible to get the thread as fine as that pro- 
duced by the silkworm. 
Flax and Linen Fibers—The fibers of the 
flax plant have been used for weaving goods so 
“long, that the records of it go back to prehistoric 
times and it is likely that it was the first of the 
vegetable fibers to. be made into cloth. So an- 
cient is the flax plant that the stems and seeds of 
it have been found in the Swiss pile dwellings, 
and the woven goods of flax fibers have been dis- 
covered in the stone age remains of northern 
Italy. Long before the pyramids were built the 
Egyptians had learned how to make linen as. fine 
_ as‘any we have to-day and they held it sacred. 
 
-P-A-G-E-163
186 WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY. 
The priests were allowed to wear only linen robes 
when in the temples, and the dead were carefully 
wrapped in it, as an examination of mummies 
that are over four thousand years old clearly 
proves. 
Linen fibers are obtained from the inner part 
_of the flax and so that the fibers may be as long 
as possible the flax is pulled up by the roots; the 
next step is to remove the seed and this is done 
with a rippling comb, hence it is called rippling. 
The stalks are softened, so that the outer bark 
of the stalks can be taken off, and this is done by 
retting them, that is either spreading the flax on 
the grass and letting it rot there, or else putting 
it in wooden vats and steeping it with warm 
water. This done, the rotted stems are subjected 
to breaking: which breaks the decayed outer bark 
apart from the fibers when the latter are divided 
into shreds by heckling, or scutching, and these 
are laid parallel with each other. 
The flax fibers are next bleached upon the 
grass and then they are boiled in lye which re- 
moves all of the coloring matter in them and 
makes them more or less white. After the flax 
plant has passed through the above processes it 
is cleaned and combed and the fibers are 
separated, then spun in moist air and woven. In 
the olden days when there was no such thing as 
haste. linen was bleached by wetting, washing,

thése operations were often repeated as many 5: 
thirty or forty times, all of which took sevéral 
months. These operations are now performed ‘in 
as many days by modern methods, but chemical 
bleaching greatly weakens the fibers. a 
Sheep and Wool Fibers—The skins of ani- 
' mals provided the first clothing for mankind, and 
the wool of the sheep and other animals was 
used before linen and cotton had come into vogue 
among the élite of the barbarians for the same 
purpose. Long before prehistoric man began to 
cultivate the land he raised sheep. In those early 
days the sheep were covered with hair, as the 
argali* and musmon,’ which are believed to be the 
progenitors of the sheep, go to show. As a mat- 
ter of fact hair and wool are one and the same 
thing, the only difference being that hair is thick, 
harsh and often straight, while wool fibers are 
covered with minute scales which overlap each 
other like those on a fish, but they are, neverthe- 
less, very soft and generally curly. © 
‘When sheep lived in their natural wild state

thick horns curved spirally outward.

they were covered with hair but close to the skin 
there grew shorter hair that was soft and curly 
_ and which was wool. Then when primitive man 
began to bring various animals in to share. his 
home with him he protected the sheep against the 
weather; the result was that the animals lost their 
long hair and the short fleecy wool grew longer 
and took its place. As civilization marched on 
‘apace, man greatly improved the quality of the 
fleece by selection and breeding and the wool 
that is now used is fine, soft, long and lustrous. 
If you will examine a wool fiber under a 
microscope you will see that, like plant fibers, it ~ 
is hollow and that it has a peculiar twist in it 
which makes it curl. This curliness is an impor- 
tant factor in spinning it into thread and because 
of it a single. pound will make almost a hundred 
miles of thread. Wool fibers are made up 
- largely of nitrogen, like proteins, that is albumi- 
nous substances, but unlike the latter it eontains 
sulphur. After the sheep are sheared the wool is 
washed and two compounds are obtained from 
it; one of these is suint, or wool-perspiration, 
which dissolves in water, and the other is yolk, 
or wool-fat, which dissolves in benzine and ether.

wool fibers have yet been made and. ‘either have 
they been produced synthetically or: otherwise... 
The Silkworm and Silk Fibers.—Silkis a fiber 
that was evidently not known to the prehistoric 
races and even after man had advanced to a stage 
of civilization he seems not to have used it to any 
great extent. Silk came originally from China 
where it has been cultivated for more than four 
thousand years. The silkworm from which we 
get our silk is really a caterpillar that is hatched 
from the eggs of a moth called the Bombya 
ori, or silkworm moth. This caterpillar has 
‘two glands which run along the inside part of its 
body and end in its mouth in two small open- 
ings, or jets, called spinnerets. It is from these 
glands that the silk substance, or silk-glue as. it 
is called, which forms the fibers is forced out, and 
of which they make their cocoons. 
The life history of a silkworm moth is this: 
the female moth lays her eggs, which have a blue 
_ tint and are about the size of the head of a pin, 
on the leaf of the white mulberry tree, which 
is the silkworm’s natural food. Soon after the 
female has laid her eggs she dies and the male 
does not live much longer. The eggs are laid 
during the latter part of June and there they re- 
main until the following April at which time the. 
mulberry leaves unfold. When the eggs hatch ° 
out the silkworms are about as long and fat asa - 
 
-P-A-G-E-167

maggot. Each little fellow grows very fast until 
it is full size which is about as large as an ordi- 
nary caterpillar. 
Can a leopard change his spots? The answer 
is emphatically no, but a silkworm can and 
does shed its skin four times in its short life of 
as many weeks. Between these changes it is very 
hungry and eats heartily of the mulberry leaves, 
and just befcre it gets ready to shed its skin the 
last time it goes into a deep sleep. After it has 
shed its skin the fourth and last time it gets Teady 
to spin its cocoon, the first step of which is to 
make a thin shell that is to protect it and its silk 
fibers which it spins round itself. In spinning 
the fiber the caterpillar moves its head freely 
around while the rear part of its body remains 
quite still. After the cocoon is complete, the 
silkworm changes into the chrysalis stage, and 
from this a baby moth finally emerges when a 
_ new cycle of life starts all over again. 
In the silk industry, however, nearly all of the 
moths are destroyed by dipping the cocoons into 
warm water which kills them, and only a few 
are allowed to emerge, as these are for the pur- 
pose of laying eggs. After the cocoon is soaked 
in water the glue-like fibers become soft, when it 
is easy to wind them onto a reel. As they are 
reeled, from four to ten fibers are run together 
and these form two threads; then these are run
-P-A-G-E-168
  CELLULOSE wat 
, together to make a single thread of raw silo: If 
you will look at a fiber of silk just as i is taken 
from a cocoon you will see that it is formed of 
two silk fibers joined‘together as they come from - 
the spinnerets of the silkworm, and that these 
are smooth and solid. Like wool, these silk © 
fibers are largely formed of nitrogen, but unlike. 
wool they contain no sulphur. Each fiber of the 
cocoon is from 2,500 to 3,000 feet in length and 
so silk as it is made by these little workers is not 
at all costly. 
Paper Maxine 
The chief ingredient of paper is cellulose, and 
as this is found in all plant life, almost any plants 
can be used for making paper. 
Linen Rag Paper.—The best paper that can 
be manufactured is made from linen rags as these 
are pure cellulose and flax fibers are very soft 
and tough. The first step is to clean them so 
that no dust or other foreign matter will remain 
in them. They are then bleached in a hot solu- 
tion of bleaching powder, that is chloride of lime, 
for about twelve hours, and then passed into a 
pulp machine; this consists of a cylinder fitted 
with rings of very sharp knife blades which set 
in a‘circular trough of water. The knife blades 
cut the rags into bits and these are washed in 
running water for six hours or so, when at the
-P-A-G-E-169
142 WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY: 
end of this time they form a pulp that is as 
smooth and even as heavy cream. 
_The pulp is now tinted with coloring matter, 
“and then enough water is added to it to make it 
about as thick as milk. It is now strained to re- 
move all of the lumpy particles and then it is 
spread on a slowly moving wire gauze belt that 
runs over a pair of cylinders which are some 
fifteen feet apart; as the gauze belt moves along 
the water in the pulp drains off and it becomes 
. hore firm. It finally reaches a cylinder called a 
dandy-roll, and on this are either parallel wires, 
‘various letters or special designs and these are 
pressed into the damp paper; it is these that 
make the water-marks you see on nearly all good 
paper and much of it that is bad. 
.. After this is done the paper, which is yet so 
wet that it would fall apart, is run between heavy 
rollers which press the water out of it; from these 
it runs between other rollers which are hot and 
these dry it out so that it will hold together, . 
when it looks like thin blotting paper. Next it is 
run through a vat containing a solution of glue 
and alum, or sizing as it is called, and. when it 
comes out it is run between another set of. hot 
rollers that calender it, that is that press and dry 
it out, when it is finished paper and ready to be 
cut into sheets.

or a paper you would hardly think that the thin, | 
soft, flexible pages were once a tree, bub itiseven 
so. After the tree is cut down, and this.may be’ 
pine, spruce, hemlock or other soft woods, the 
log is.cut up into chips by a cutting machine. — 
There are several processes used for converting - 
_ the wood into pulp, and in one of them the chips 
are boiled in a strong solution of caustic soda 
under steam pressure. This breaks up the: wood 
into cellulose and lignin, and the latter, which is — 
of no value, is dissolved out. The pulp that re- 
mains consists of nearly pure cellulose and 
_ weighs about one-third as much as the wood of 
which it was made. The pulp is then thoroughly 
washed to get the soda out of it, and following 
this: it is bleached by chloride of lime or some 
other compound or process which will set the 
chlorine free. The pulp is then made into paper 
by a similar process to the one for rag paper, 
described above.

COLORS, PIGMENTS, AND PAINTS 
y Paints are used for three different purposes — 
and these are: first, to please the eye, second, to 
prevent things from rotting or rusting, and 
third, to make ‘and metal surfaces sanitary. 
The first mode*tt man, that is the original man 
from which all of the present races came, 
- was the first painter. He was a cave dweller 
and in Southern France at a place called Cro- 
Magnon and in Northern Spain, at Altamira, 
are caves, or rather caverns, which were used by 
successive generations for thousands of years for 
homes before houses were known. 
The walls of these caves are covered with 
paintings of the animals that lived in that age 
and while the men who made them knew nothing 
of drawing in perspective, the paintings are, 
nevertheless, quite lifelike and possess real merit. 
When civilization had reached a stage where 
wood and metals were used in making various 
objects and in the construction of buildings it 
was soon found that wood had a tendency to - 
rot away, and metal to rust to pieces. To

prevent this, various kinds of colo: 
obtained chiefly from the earth, were mix l with 
oil and when the resulting paint was smeared on 
the surface of things, air and water had‘no im- 
Mediate effect upon them. In recent years the - 
value of paints and varnishes for covering ex- 
posed surfaces, both outside and in, has been 
- fully appreciated and there is a special kind of 
paint now made for every purpose. 
About Paints in General.—Paints can be di- 
vided into two general classes, and these are 
water colors, that is paints made by mixing pig- 
‘ments, as the coloring matter is called, with 
water; and oil paints, that is paints made by mix- 
ing pigments with oil. Both kinds of paints are 
used for art work and for commercial work, the 
only. difference between them being that for — 
painting pictures the finest materials only are 
used and these are prepared with the utmost. 
care, 
For buildings and the like water colors are 
good only for the temporary protection of their 
surfaces, to make them sanitary or to improve 
their appearance. Water colors are usually 
made by dissolving a pigment of some kind in 
water or in sizing, which is a weak solution of 
glue. Thus ordinary whitewash is made by mix- 
. ing calcium hydrowide, that is slaked lime, with 
water... Now when this is laid on a surface that    
 
-P-A-G-E-173
146 WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY 
is exposed to the air the carbon dioxide in the 
latter is absorbed by the lime and combines with 
it, when calciumrcarbonate is formed and which, 
when dry, is pure white. A whitewash that lasts 
longer than ordinary whitewash is known as 
government whitewash. It is made by slacking 
lime in warm water, adding a solution of com- 
mon salt, a paste made of ground rice and a solu- 
tion of glue in which some Spanish whiting has 
been dissolved. Enough hot water is then added 
to give it the proper consistency. 
Waiter colors for art work are usually made by 
dissolving a pigment of some color in a weak 
solution of glue or casein, and when the water 
dries out, the particles of the pigment will be 
cemented together. Calsomines for interior 
work are for the most part made of chalk dis- 
solved in a weak solution of glue and then adding 
a pigment of the desired color. \ 
Oil paints have far greater lasting qualities 
than water colors and for this reason wherever 
paints are to be exposed to the weather this 
kind is always used. Oil paints are made up of 
three, four, and sometimes five, compounds and 
these are a vegetable oil, a pigment and a volatile | 
oil; very often a drier is mixed in to make it dry 
more quickly and occasionally a varnish is added 
to make it glossy when dry. The reason vege- 
table oils, such as linseed oil or poppy oil, are
-P-A-G-E-174
    COLORS 
used is that paints made of them harden ‘by ab- 
sorbing the oxygen of the air, whereas renee 
oils harden by evaporation. a 
- Oil of turpentine, or turpentine as it is “called 
for short, is generally used to thin the paint, 
as it evaporates quickly after the paint is spread: 
on the surface. Driers are often used to make 
the paint dry more quickly, and various com- 
pounds are employed; among these are red 
lead, manganese oxide and cobaltie carbonate 
and nickel oxide and sulphate. Varnishes are 
made by dissolving lacs, that is gums, in alcohol, 
or amber, copal or other gums in boiled linseed 
oil... Oil varnishes are, of course, more per-- 
manent than spirit varnishes as the alcohol var- 
fishes are called. 
x Ql hat Pigments are Made of —Pigments, as 
the coloring compounds used in paints are called, 
ye obtained from several different sources and 
Koons them are: first, the natural pigments 
found in the earth and those obtained from plants 
and animals; second, pigments made by mixing 
or combining various substances; and third, those 
found in coal-tar products. In making paint | 
a white pigment, such as white lead or zine owide 
is. generally used as a base, and this is mixed 
with the oil first and then a pigment of the de- 
- sired “color, is stirred i in. These. bases will be de- 
scribed presently. “

_ Natural Pigments—There are some earth 
colors, as natural pigments are called, which are 
either found in the natural state ready to use, or 
have to be treated by various processes before 
they can be used. Iron rust, that is ferric oxide 
forms several pigments of various colors. Red 
ochre and yellow ochre consist chiefly of ferric 
oxide; when this is mixed with calcium sulphate, 
it makes Indian red, and when mixed with 
aluminum silicate, that is kaolin, which is a kind 
of fine clay, it makes Venetian red. When yel- 
low ochre is highly heated it changes to a rich 
brown color and then it is ealled sienna. 
Raw wmber and burnt wmber are also formed 
chiefly of ferric oxide; raw umber has an olive 
brown color and this is due to the silicon and 
manganese diowide in it; when it is heated ta.a 
‘high temperature the iron in it is changed to 
hydrated ferric oxide; it then takes on a reddish 
color when it is called burnt umber. A. bright 
green pigment known as terre verte, or green 
earth, is composed of ferric oxide and silicon 
oxide, that is silica. The pigment called van- 
dyke brown was formerly obtained from the earth 
but it is now made by mixing ferric oxide, yellow 
ochre and burnt cork. Barytes, whose formula 
is BaSO,, that is barium, sulphur and oxygen, 
is the common name for bariwm sulphate, and is 
found in nature as barite, or heavy spar, and is
-P-A-G-E-176
  COLORS” 
treated with sulphuric acid to get rid of the iron 
in it. It is a white pigment and is often: used to 
adulterate white lead and zinc white. It is also 
prepared chemically when it is known as per- 
manent white. 
Of the pigments that are produced by plants 
may be mentioned indigo, madder, tumeric ‘and 
logwood, but all of these are now made as good _ 
or better from coal-tar by synthesis (see Chap- 
ter XV), while carmine, which is obtained by 
drying the female cochineal, an insect that lives 
upon a kind of cactus in Central America, is also 
reproduced from coal-tar. 
Chemical Pigments——-Among the chemical 
pigments, that is pigments which are made by 
combining elements or compounds, is white lead 
which is a basic lead compound. There are sev- 
eral different ways of making it, the chief ones 
being the Dutch, French and English processes. 
The Dutch process is the oldest, most primitive 
and the best but it is slow. In this process the 
lead is wound in spirals and placed in earthen- 
-ware pots with some vinegar in the bottom of 
’ them... These are set in beds of horse manure, 
the decomposition of which gives off carbon di- 
owide and. the heat generated starts the action on 
the lead. . This forms a basic acetate of lead when 
a basie ‘carbonate of lead, which is white lead, is 
nto down. The English method is a modi-    
 
-P-A-G-E-177
150 WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY: 
fication of the Dutch method. The French 
method is more up-to-date as the carbon dioxide 
is obtained by burning coke. To make paint of 
white lead it is ground in oil and then thinned 
down with linseed oil and turpentine, and colored 
with other pigments. American  vermilion, 
minium or red lead, as it is variously called, is 
made by gently heating lead oxide when it ab- 
sorbs oxygen from the air and this makes it take 
on a bright réd color. It is largely used for 
painting iron work. 
Lead chromes are very lasting pigments but 
they are not at all cheap.. Lead chromate is 
found in nature, and when lead salt is treated 
with a solution of a chromate a bright yellow 
precipitate is thrown down, and this is the pig- 
ment called chrome yellow. Another lead pig- 
ment is chrome red, or American vermilion, as 
it is called, and this is a basic lead chromate. 
Then there are two kinds of chrome green, the 
first of which is made of lead chromate; and the 
second from chromic oxide; the latter pigment is 
a beautiful emerald green and is very permanent. 
Because zine white will cover a larger amount 
of surface, is cheaper and does not darken when 
exposed to the sun, it has been largely used in 
recent years in the place of white ledd. It does 
not, however, last as well. Zine white used to be 
ealled Flores zinci, that is flowers of zinc, and
-P-A-G-E-178

also 1 philosopher’ s wool. It is simply wine oxide 
and is made by either burning zinc in air, or heat- 
ing basic zinc carbonate, which lgtter compound 
is made by adding sodium carbonate to a, solution 
of zinc sulphate. 
Prussian blue, which is ferric ferrocyanide, ‘Is 
a powerful pigment and is made by treating a 
solution of ferrous sulphate with potassium 
ferrocyanide, when a precipitate of a bluish white 
color is obtained. This is next treated with oxi- 
dizing agents, when a deep blue pigment results. 
A cheap imitation of Prussian blue is sold under 
_ the name of Brunswick blue and this is made by 
mixing a small quantity of Prussian blue with: 
a large amount of barytes. 
_A wonderful blue pigment known as ultra- 
marine was once made of the rare mineral lapis 
lazuli, which consists of sodiwm and aluminium 
silicate together with a sulphur compound. U]- 
tramarine thus obtained was a very costly pig- 
ment; then in 1828 it was made by melting soda, 
sulphur and charcoal together. This was the . 
first synthetic pigment ever made and it is even 
more jeautiful. than that obtained from lapis: 
lazuli, ‘Further, there are now made a number of 
different: colors of ultramarine, ranging from a 
deep.blue to a sky blue and also white, red, yel- 
low, green and violet. So the word ultramarine

of the sea. Cobalt is a reddish-white metal and it 
is nearly always fourid in combination with 
nickel. Cobalt blue is a compound of aluminium 
owide and cobaltie owide and it is.as beautiful a 
pigment as ultramarine blue. 
A pigment that has the same formula as 
barytes (BaSO,), that is it is barium sulphate, 
’ also goes under the name of permanent white 
and blane five. It is made by the ton and is - 
often used to adulterate white lead and zinc 
white, and also in making lithopone. 'This lat- 
ter pigment, which is also sold under the trade 
names of ponolith, oleum white, etc., is made by 
mixing barium sulphide and zinc sulphate to- 
gether, then heating them to redness and sud- 
denly cooling the mixture in water, when a snow. 
white pigment is produced. When lithopone is 
made into paint it will cover more surface than 
white lead but it is not as lasting and becomes 
discolored when it is exposed to the sun. 
Black pigments generally wear well as they 
are formed chiefly of carbon. The pigment 
called lamp-black is obtained by collecting the 
soot of burning oils. This is a finely divided 
form of carbon that is deposited on a cold sur- 
face when placed in a flame. As oils are formed 
of carbon and hydrogen they are called hydro- 
carbons. Bone-black is made by charring bones, 
that is by heating them without enough air to

ag that for making charcoal from wood aid coke

How Lakes are Made.—'There isan Fast In- 
dian scale insect called the Carteria lacca and 
from it is obtained a beautiful scarlet and crim-— 
son pigment. The French word for lacca is 
laque and from this we get the word lac which 
means a gum and also lake which means a pig- 
ment. A lake, in the chemistry of paints, is 
formed when a color is made by combining a 
plant, animal or coal-tar color with the oxide of 
ametal. The metallic oxides that are generally _ 
used for this purpose are tin and aluminum, and 
when an organic color combines with one or the 
other of them a precipitate is thrown down and 
this forms a new pigment called a lake. Thus 
when indigo is combined with aluminium owide a 
blue lake is formed; when logwood is combined 
with aluminium oxide a purple lake results; when 
tumeric is combined with aluminium oxide or- 
_ ange lake is produced and when cochineal and 
aluminium oxide are combined that beautiful 
pigment known as carmine lake is obtained. 
What.is Meant by Vehicles —The liquid that 
a pigment is mixed with to make a paint is'called 
the ‘vehicle. For mixing artists’ colors poppy 
oil, Which i is a very fine and costly oil, is used. 
     
-P-A-G-E-181
154 WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY — 
For all ordinary painting the pigment is mixed. 
with linseed oil.. This is made by grinding the 
seed of the flax plant into meal and then pressing 
it. If the flax seed is pressed when it is cold the 
oil will be very light in color, but if the meal is 
heated much more oil can be extracted from it 
but it will be of a darker color; in either case it 
is called raw linseed oil. When raw linseed oil 
is used to mix pigments with it dries slowly, and 
forms a film on the surface that is solid and yet. 
elastic enough to stretch and contract with the 
surface which it covers. Boiled linseed oil is oil 
that has been heated and in which either red lead 
or manganese diowide has been dissolved. As 
these compounds make the oil absorb the oxygen 
of the air faster, boiled oil makes paints dry 
quicker than raw oil. 
Driers and How They Act-—To further 
hasten the process of making paints dry a spe- 
cial drier is mixed with them. By heating boiled 
linseed oil, which, as above said, contains red 
lead or manganese dioxide, until a syrupy 
liquid results and thinning it down with benzine * 
* There is a.difference between benzine with an é and benzene 
with an ¢ as the spelling indicates. Formerly the benzine that 
was used for cleaning was benzole, a volatile oil obtained from 
coal tar.. Benzene, as the word is now used, is benzole 
while bensine is obtained by the fractional distillation of petro-. 
Jewm, when gasoline runs off first, then benzine, and then kero- 
sene. :

or turpentine, an oil drier as it is ‘oa pro - 
duced. By melting resins with the oxides of, 
various metals and thinning the mixture down 
with benzine or turpentine a Japan drier'is made. 
After the pigment is mixed with the oil it must 
be thinned down before it can be spread on the 
surface with a brush. Turpentine is generally 
used for this purpose and it is. obtained by the 
destructive distillation of wood of pine trees or 
the pitch obtained from them. Varnishes are 
sometimes mixed with paints to make them 
glossy when dry, but they are more frequently 
used as a protective covering over paint and form 
a hard, transparent and glossy coat. A good 
-varnish will not be affected by water, or dust 
when scratched; on the other hand a poor varnish * 
is generally adulterated with resin, and when wet 
will become spotted and when scratched will 
break up into a fine white powder. 
- About Ready-Mixed Paints—Time was and 
" now is when a professional painter mixed his own 
paints, that is he would buy the white lead 
ground i in oil, the pigments in their dry form, 
‘and the linseed oil in bulk, and mix them until he 
obtained the color, tint or shade he wanted. But 
there were many men, and women too, who wished 
a little painting on their own hook, but 
who. were not skillful enough to mix paints , 
wake would live up to the color scheme they had    
   
-P-A-G-E-183
156 WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY . 
in'mind anid, consequently, the results were often 
far from those they had fondly anticipated. To 
supply this “long felt want” ready-mixed 
paints were put on the market and they have 
proved a boon to the amateur painter. 
The chief troubles with ready-mixed paints 
have been, first, that the white lead and other pig- 
ments in them would fall to the bottom of. the 
cans, or other containers, and no amount of stir- 
ring would get them back to. their original con-” 
dition, and second, the paints were nearly always 
adulterated to the point of being useless. It was 
finally found that if a solution of sodium silicate, 
or water-glass as it is commonly called, was 
stirred into the mixed paint it would emulsify it, 
that is it would keep the particles of pigments 
evenly distributed throughout the paint. The 
water-glass, however, made them still less du- 
rable and so other emulsifiers were tried. 
Among these were rubber solutions which are 
still used, but a simpler expedient is to mix a very 
smal] amount of water with them which holds the 
particles of pigments in suspension, and this 
scheme is very generally used. The tendency to 
use adulterants in mixed paints is growing less 
all the time, as the better makers of paints are 
fighting against the practice and some states have 
laws that regulate the quality of paints that may 
be sold.

CHEMISTRY OF THE SUNBEAM 
Ayz.ife that exists, or has ever existed, on the 
garth.ig due to the action of unseen forces that 
are contained in the sun’s rays. This may seem 
like a very sweeping statement but it is easily 
within the limits of proof to say definitely that if 
it were not for the kindly light and heat of the 
sun not only would plant life be impossible on 
our earth but animal life as well, and this, of 
course, includes human beings. 
‘When seeds are planted they must be supplied 
with ‘three things, besides a good soil, if they are 
_ to grow, and these are moisture, ovygen and heat. 
. If any one of these factors is missing thé seeds ” 
will not. germinate; for instance, if they have 
enough moisture and heat and the oxygen is lack- 
ing they will not sprout, and for this reason they 
should not be planted so deep that the air cannot 
reach them. Again if oxygen and heat are pres- 
- ent and they are without moisture they will not 
sprout—which i is a very clever provision of Na- 
° ‘wise seeds could not be stored away
-P-A-G-E-185
158 WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY 
Lastly, seeds that: have the proper amount of 
moisture and oxygen but which are not supplied 
with heat will not sprout, and so the heat must be 
furnished by the sun either directly or indirectly. 
If the heat is artificial, that is produced by some 
burning fuel like wood, coal or oil, or by an ele- 
ment heated by electricity the heat comes from 
the sun just the same for the wood is recent plant 
life, the coal is plant life that existed a million 
years or more ago, and the oil is formed of animal 
life that thrived when the world was young. 
If the heat is set up by an electric current.then 
the latter in turn is generated by either coal 
which is burned under a, boiler or else by water 
falling on. a turbine, that is a specially con- 
structed water wheel. Where a fuel is burned to 
generate power it is produced by the action of 
the sun’s rays, and where the power is generated 
_ by falling water again the sun developed it; this 
it did by evaporating the water from the lakes 
and oceans, when it ascended, and then on cool- 
ing it condensed into drops, fell to the earth and 
flowed down a river where it finally turned the 
water wheel.

white like mushrooms and toadstools which are 
devoid of it; and second, by means of it and the 
light of the sun, the carbon dioxide and water 
vapor absorbed from the air are changed into 
plant. building tissues and other compounds, and : 
oxygen is given off. 
How the Sun Acts on Chlorophyl—To show 
that the sun acts on the chlorophyl in the cells of 
a-plant all you have to do is to place a very young 
plant that has grown from seed in a place where 
the light cannot reach it; now while it will keep 
on growing as long as the soil provides it with 
food; it will take on a sickly white appearance. 
The way in which the carbon and hydrogen com- 
pounds, or carbohydrates as they are called, are 
formed in the cells of plants is passing strange 
as the following goes to show. The leaves of 
plants are provided with little openings, or holes, 
in the under sides of them and these are. called 
stamate (plural of stomata), These are the 
nostrils of the plants and they breathe through 
them twenty-four hours a day, just as you and I 
breathe through our nostrils. 
_TPhese openings, or stomate, are connected 
\ with tubes or ducts, which, in turn, lead to and 
end .in the cells of the plants. Plants inhale 
and take the carbon dioxide from it;    
-P-A-G-E-187
160 WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY / 
while animals exhale carbon dioxide, they exhale 
oxygen. It is from the carbon dioxide of the 
air that the carbon the plants need is obtained. 
When the carbon dioxide reaches the cells it com- 
bines with the water the plant has taken from 
the soil and together these produce carbonic acid. 
Next the carbonic acid is decomposed by the 
action of the rays of sunlight working with the 
chlorophyl, and formaldehyde and oxygen are 
formed. It is at this stage that the plants exhale 
the oxygen. The formaldehyde, which is a gas 
with a stifling smell, is converted into glucose, or 
grape sugar, so called because it is the kind that 
is found in grapes. This sugar, which is only 
about one-fifth as sweet as cane sugar, is carried 
to various parts of plants where, on. losing. a 
molecule of water, two molecules of the grape 
sugar change into either cellulose, which forms 
' the tissues of all plants, or starch, which is very 
closely related to sugar and to alcohol. Other 
compounds necessary to plant life are also made 
from the glucose.

ST wes Said that sunlight is necessary 
for plant growth, it is well known that artificial 
ight, as that from an electric are, which is white 
like that of the sun, will also serve the purpose; 
but again it must be remembered that the electric 
light is an indirect result of the sun’s energy. 
Action of the Sunbeam on Animals—From 
what has gone before, it must be clear that plants 
can grow only with the aid of the light and heat 
from the sun, and it is just as true of animals, in- 
cluding man, as it is of plants. The herbivorous 
animals, that is those which live on plants only, 
are equally as dependent on the sun’s rays as the plants they eat, though not as directly so. The 
-earnivorous animals, that is those which eat flesh, 
are dependent on the herbivorous animals for 
their food and so they too could not live if it were 
not for the sun. Man is by habit both a herbiv- 
orous and a carnivorous animal but, curiously . 
enough, when he gets a little civilized his stomach 
grows squeamish when it comes to eating carniv- 
orous animals themselves. 
How Light Acts on Chemicals While the 
action of light on plants and animals is wonder- 
fully interesting still it cannot be easily seen; 
there are, however, various compourids that light

acts.on in a most striking manner, which are out- 
side the realm of living matter, and these we can 
experiment with and examine with pleasure and 
profit. 
Action of Light on Silver Compounds.— 
Light has not only the power of building, up the 
tissues of plants amt aitinals but W alee has the 
power to decompose, that is to break down, cer- 
tain compounds. ‘The compounds that light acts’ 
on the quickest are those formed of silver, ‘and 
among the most” important of 1 of these aré> silver 
nitrate, silver chioride,_silver io and silver 
bri Of these are or r have been used in 
photography. Silver nitrate is made by dissolving silver in a 
solution of nitric acid and water. When this so- 
~ lution is evaporated er. crystals of silver nitrate are 
formed. Then if the _erystals are dissolved in 
water a solution is formed which the light will not 
affect as long as it is kept in a bottle, but if a 
little of it is brushed over a sheet of paper, or 
other organic surface, and exposed to the light 
it will instantly turn black. Owing to this action 
of light on silver nitrate it was formerly much. 
used as a hair dye and for making indelible ink, — 
but its chief use is for sensitizing plates and 
paper for photographic purposes. 
The reason a solution of silver nitrate is not 
affected by the light when it is in a bottle, but is

turned dark by the light when it is ls

acts on silver nitrate only. when it is ini contact . 
with organic matter. By organic matter is. 
meant a substance or a compound that is formed 
af matter that is living or which has-once lived. 
Thus collodion is made of guncotton, which is 
made from the fibers of plants. 
_ Silver chloride is made by dissolving sodium 
chloride, which is common table salt, in water and 
then dissolving some silver nitrate in this solu- 
tion. The result is a double decomposition, as 
the chemists call it, which takes place thus: 
fom er, ke ten 
The ‘silyer chloride is thrown down as a white 
card-like salt. If, now, you will coat a sheet of 
“paper with a solution of the silver chloride and 
expose it to the light you will see that it takes 
ona purple hue first and then changes to a brown 
color... It changed color because the light de- 
composed the silver chloride into silver and 
chlorine, the two elements which formed it, thus:

As the latter is taken up by the paper or gelatin

Silver iodide and silver bromide are made in 
the same way as silver chloride and are acted on 
by the light in the same way but they are even 
more sensitive and, hence, are used for making 
rapid photographic plates and papers. - 
How Light Makes Photographs—The Da- 
guerreotype.—This process of photography is a 
very old one and was discovered by M. Daguerre, 
to whom the French Government gave a pension 
of six thousand francs a year (twelve hundred 
dollars). It consisted of a plate of silver, or a 
plate of copper coated with silver on One side, 
which was exposed to the vapors of iodine until 
silver iodide was formed on it. This operation 
had to be performed in a dark room lighted. only 
by a dim yellow or red light. 
The plate thus prepared was placed in a 
holder and quickly taken to the camera where the 
operator inserted it and then drew out the slide. 
The sitter having already been posed and the 
camera focussed the cap of the lens was removed 
and the plate exposed. The rays of light re- 
flected from the sitter onto the plate in the camera 
decomposed the silver iodide in proportion to 
their intensity, and this depended on the colors 
and the lights and shades of the original which 
formed the image. 
4Red and yellow rays of light have far less effect on silver 
solutions than white light.
-P-A-G-E-192
    
  CHEMISTRY OF THE SUNE 
If, then, the sitter wore white cloth : 
the light that fell upon it would be reflected onto 
the plate, whereas if the dress or suit was black 
practically all of the light was absorbed by it and 
so none of it would reach the plate. In this way 
different colors and tints and shades reflected 
greater or lesser amounts of light which acted on 
the plate accordingly. After the exposure was 
made, the slide was again inserted in the holder 
when it was carried back to the dark-room and 
the plate removed. So far as the eye could see, 
the light had made no change in the sensitive 
film of the plate, but it had really decomposed 
the silver iodide. 
The plate was next subjected to the vapor of 
mercury when if combined with the free silver 
and formed an amalgam.’ The image which re- 
sulted gave very good values of the lights and 
shades, and to fix it, that is make it as permanent 
_ as possible, the plate was next treated with a so- 
lution. of sodium hyposulphite which washed 
away that part of the silver iodide that the light 
had not decomposed. Finally a varnish made of 
gold. chloride and sodium hyposulphite was 
poured over the plate, which was then warmed, 
‘when a positive picture resulted. 
The Old Wet Plate Process—Since only one 
picture at,a time could be made by the da- 
“4An. alloy. or union of mercury with some other metal,
-P-A-G-E-193
166 WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY 
guerreotype process, other means were diligently 
sought for by which a number of duplicate pic- 
tures could be struck off. In 1881 Fox Talbot, 
of England, discovered a way to make negatives 
of paper from which he could make as many 
prints as he wished. Since the grain of the paper 
negative was always shown in the prints made 
from it Sir John Herschel suggested the use of 
glass for the negative. 
The old wet plate process consisted of first 
pouring upon a clear glass plate some iodized col- 
lodion, that is collodion to which was added some 
ammonium iodide and which when the ether 
evaporated left behind a thin transparent film. 
Next the platé was dipped into a bath of silver 
nitrate. The moment it was dipped, that is while 
it was still wet, it was put into a light-tight plate 
holder and. the latter placed in the camera, and- 
the exposure of the sitter was made. This done 
the plate was taken to the dark-room and devel- 
oped, that is it was put in a tray and covered with 
a solution of iron sulphate, when the action of it 
on the silver compound of the film brought out 
the image, which, however, was reversed on the 
plate. When the image was fully brought out 
the action was checked by washing the plate in 
water. The next step was to fix the image so 
that the light would have no further action on 
the silver iodide. The fixing operation consisted
-P-A-G-E-194
    
         CHEMISTRY OF THE SUN 
of soaking the plate in a solution of sodium. 
sulphite, or hypo as we now call it for 
dissolved off the silver iodide which had ng 
acted-on by the light. The plate, now,ca 
negative, was washed in water, dried. an 
coat of amber varnish to keep it from. getting 
seratched. 
: From the negative, in which the lights and 
shades were reversed, paper pictures were made, 
or printed as it is called. The sensitive: paper 
was made by soaking paper in sodium chloride, 
- to-fill up the pores and then coating it with a 
solution of silver nitrate. The negative was laid 
in a printing frame with the film side up and the - 
silver paper was laid on top of the negative with 
its film-side down, when the frame was set out so 
that the sun’s rays would shine through the nega- 
tive and on to the paper. 
When the print was dark enough it was taken. 
out of the frame and placed in a toning bath 
made.of gold chloride and sodium bicarbonate 
dissolved in water. The purpose of toning the 
prints was to give them a richer color than could 
be‘obtained without it. Next the print was fixed 
in a. hypo. solution which dissolved the silver 
chloride that had not been decomposed by the 
sun's rays; it was then washed in running water 
     
~ 'Yfater improvement was to.coat the surface of the paper 
with albuiven, which gave it a glossy surface. 
 
-P-A-G-E-195

to get out all the hypo and, finally, it was dried 
and mounted on a card. 
The Modern Dry Plate Process—The next 
big advance in photography was the use of the 
dry plate for the wet plate. The first dry plates 
were made by Scott Archer, of England, in 1851, 
and these he coated with collodion, dipped them 
in a silver bath and let them dry, but they were 
slow and unsatisfactory in general. In 1871 
Maddox, of England, got up the gelatine emul- 
sion process, that is he made an emulsion, by 
heating silver nitrate and gelatine slowly together, 
coating the plates with it and letting them dry. 
These plates were not at all fast but they formed 
the basis for improvements which have resulted in 
plates so quick in action that an exposure of only 
one one-thousandth of a second, or less, will im- 
press an image on the plate. 
Different from a wet plate which must be used 
before it dries, a dry plate can be used any time. 
It is exposed in a camera in the way already 
‘described, except that a shutter must be used 
to make the exposure, as the cap scheme is 
altogether too slow. Dry plates are developed 
in a solution of pyrogallic acid or some of the

The deyeloper changes the silver bromide which — 
was acted on by the light into metallic: silver and 
the parts on which the light has not acted remain 
silver bromide. A more recent improvement on 
the glass dry plate is the use of celluloid. films, 
which make it possible to use hand cameras and 
moving picture cameras and projectors. 
Velox. Printing Paper—Styles in clothing 
change from season to season, and likewise do 
they change in photographic papers though not 
so often, Silver paper, as just stated above, 
must be exposed to the direct rays of the sun- 
light and the toning, fixing, and other processes. 
necessary to make them works of art require 
much time and manipulation. Besides, every- 
body got tired of seeing the same old brown and 
-white pictures.. So Dr. Baekeland, the inventor 
of bakelite, a cheap substitute for hard rubber, 
got up a paper in 1898 that had a silver emulsion 
coating on it like that used for dry plates, but on 
which the light acted very much slower, so that 
it could be printed by artificial light. Also like - 
a dry plate this paper, to which the trade name of 
velox was given, is developed to bring out the 
image; it is then fixed with hypo and dried, when 
a beautiful black and white picture results. 
Color Photography.—If you have ever looked

era you must have been struck with the vivid 
beauty of its coloring. So has everyone who ever 
saw it, and so from the earliest days of photog- 
raphy investigators have striven to fix the image 
in its natural colors. The first scheme by which 
the image of an object.could be shown in natural 
colors was invented by Frederick E. Ives, of 
Philadelphia, and it is known as the Ives three- 
color process. It begins by assuming that white 
dight, 3¢ from the sun or an electric arc, is made 
up-of three primary colors, red, green and blae- violet, and that all other colors, tints and “shades 
can be produced by the proper blending of these

A special camera is used which has three lenses 
in a row so that three separate negatives of an

the same time. Back of the first lens is a piece

and back of the third is a blue-violet glass. These 
‘glasses are called color screens. The-red glass 
lets only red light waves go through it, the green 
glass, green light waves, and the blue-violet glass 
blue-violet light waves, and screens out all other 
waves.

ELECTRO-CHEMICAL PROCESSES 
Like light, electricity has a very decided ac- 
tion on certain chemical compounds and, the 
other way about, certain compounds produce not 
only light but electricity as well. The science of 
chemical reactions that set up electricity and of 
electricity acting on chemicals is called electro- 
chemistry. It began when Volta found in 1800 
‘that a disk of zinc and one of copper separated 
by a piece of cloth dipped in vinegar produced a 
current of electricity. 
Electro-chemistry may be divided into. three 
general classes and these are, first, the produc- 
tion of electric currents by chemical processes, as 
with batteries; second, plating metal objects with 
metals of other kinds either to preserve them, to 
make them look better or for obtaining casts; and 
’ third, for extracting metals from their com- 
pounds and refining them. The processes for 
making synthetic and new compounds in the 
electric furnace is a secondary use of the current, 
for it is the heat of the arc light that works the 
changes and not the direct application of the « cur- 
rent itself.

How Electricity is Made. —Th 
ways by which electrici € 
among these are: (1) by friction, as ‘when's glass, 
rod is rubbed with a piece of silk, when. iti is called 
frictional, or static electricity, (2) by-héat, 
on two unlike metals when it is called ¢/ 
electricity, (3) by chemical action as when zine 
and copper are acted on by a salt, alkaline or an 
acid solution as in an electric cell, or voltaic cell 
as. it-used to be called, and (4) by_electromag- 
netic induction, as when parallel wires are made’ 
to cut through a magnetic field, as in the dynamo   
      
_ electric machine. The only process that con- 
cerns us here is the one by which a current is set 
up. by chemical action. 
Kinds of Electric Cells.—An electric cell is an 
apparatus for generating a current by chemical 
' action, as stated above, and when two or more 
'. dectric cells are coupled, that is joined together, 
_ they-form a battery. Now electric cells may ‘be 
: divided * into two general kinds, namely the pri-, 
d the secondary cell, or accumulator 
as it i is ealled in England, or. storage cell as we 
call: ait here in the States. The difference be- 
tween ‘them is that a primary cell generates

Primary Battery Cells and How They Work. 
—Now while all primary cells generate a current 
on the same principle they, likewise, are of two 
general kinds and these are the dry cell and the 
wet.cel]l. The dry_cell is not all dry, but is so 
called because it does not contain any free liquid 
and, further, it is sealed to prevent any possible 
chance of leakage. It is widely used for a vari- 
‘ety of purposes such as flash-lamps, electric bells, 
annunciators and all places where a large but mo- 
mentary current’ is needed, | 
These_cells are again divided into “open circuit 
nasa ae d closed cireuit cells. With a cell of the 
first é wires connected with it must be 
kept open, that is separated except for the brief 
interval the current is being used, while with the 
second, the circuit must be kept closed so that the 
current can flow through it all the time. 
About Open-Circuit Cells——All primary cells 
are made up of three parts besides the electro- 
lyte, or solution, and some of them have four 
parts. The parts of a | simple cell consist of a 
cup, or jar, that holds the electrolyte and in 
which are immersed a piece of zinc and 6 pie 
carbon. These pieces are called elements, while
-P-A-G-E-202
       ELECTRO-PROCESSE 
the. zine j is known as the cathode: 
element as the anode. It is important remem- 
ber these names for they are used altogether in 
the analysis of water, in electroplating and in the 
electrolysis of various compounds. .. Binding, 
posts are usually fastened to the upper ends of: 
the elements so that wires can be connected easily 
and quickly to them. 
A dry cell consists of a can, or cup, made of 
sheet.zinc and this forms the negative element, or 
- cathode, of the cell. A carbon rod, which is the 
positive element, or anode, is sét in the middle of 
the zinc.cup, but does not touch it, and an electro- 
lyte, which is an active paste, is filled in between 
the electrodes to within half-an-inch of the top, 
when melted pitch is poured over it and which, 
when cold, holds the carbon and the paste in 
place and prevents the possibility of any liquid 
from leaking out. The paste is made of xine 
owide, zine chloride, ammonium chloride, which is 
sal ammoniac, manganese dioxide and plaster-of- 
paris, all ‘of which are mixed into a paste with 
water. 
Now as long as the wires which are connected 
with the elements are kept apart, that is as long 
as the circuit remains broken, no chemical action 
will: take place between the electrolyte and the 
zing, -but. the moment the wires are joined ‘to- 
gether a current will be set up and flow through 
 
-P-A-G-E-203
176 WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY. 
the electrolyte from the.zine to the carbon, and 
through the wire circuit from the carbon to the 
zine. Since the current flows from the carbon to 
the wire connected with it, it is called the positive 
element, and since it flows from the wire to the 
zine this is called the negative element. 
A wet cell, which uses a solution of sal ammo- 
niac for the electrolyte, comprises a glass jar, a 
carbon plate set into a porous cup, with a com- 
pound made of manganese dioxide and powdered 
carbon packed around it; a zine rod is then set in 
the jar and the latter filled with a solution of sal 
ammoniac dissolved in water. The chemical ac- 
tion of both the dry and the wet cells is the same 
as follows: When the circuit is closed the sal 
ammoniac acts on the zine and forms zinc chlo- 
ride; at the same time it sets free both ammonia 
,and hydrogen. The purpose of the manganese 
dioxide is to oxidize the hydrogen which it does 
slowly; if the circuit is kept closed for any length 
of time the hydrogen is set free faster than it is 
oxidized and this prevents further chemical ac- 
tion from taking place, when the cell is said to be 
polarized. On breaking the circuit and letting 
the cell stand for a short time, it recovers and will 
again generate a current. 
About Closed Circuit Cells. _Different from 
the open circuit cells just described, closed circuit

  ELECTRO-PROCES 
cells give more powerful currents and the circuit 
can be kept closed for long periods at’ a time. 
The Bunsen cell was invented by Professor Bun- 
sen, of Germany, in 1841, and is one of the best 
of the closed circuit cells, hence it is good for 
electroplating on a small scale. It is made up of 
a glass jar in which there is a large cylinder of 
zine; a porous cup sets inside of this and inside of 
the porous cup sets a carbon plate. Two differ- 
ent compounds are used for the electrolyte, the 
first being concentrated nitric acid, which is 
placed in the porous cup, and dilute sulphuric acid 
is placed in the glass jar. Now when the circuit is 
closed the action of the sulphuric acid on the zine 
sets hydrogen free; this goes through the porous 
cup and on coming in contact with the nitric acid 
produces nitrogen perowide, a very irritating and 
eorrosive gas, which passes off from the cell. 
The gravity, or crowfoot, cell is used on tele- 
graph lines where a current from a dynamo is not. available. It is a simplified form of a Daniell 
cell, As far back as 1836 Professor Daniell, of 
London, was working on a cell which would gen- 
erate a constant current and he succeeded very 
well. His cell consisted of a glass jar in which 
there was placed a copper cylinder. Inside the 
Jatter was a porous cup and inside of this a zine 
rod. .The glass jar was filled with a saturated 
solution of copper sulphate, that is blue vitriol,
-P-A-G-E-205
178 WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY 
and the porous cup was filled with a dilute solu- 
tion of zinc sulphate; the porous cup allowed the 
two solutions to mix very slowly. 
The gravity cell is really a Daniell cell without 
the porous cup. It consists of a glass jar with 
a star-shaped strip of copper resting on the bot- 
tom; the bare end of an insulated wire is soldered - 
to the copper and this leads up to and outside of 
the jar, while a heavy zine casting with finger- 
like projections is hooked on to the top of the jar. 
As the zinc looks something like a crow’s foot the 
cell is often called a crowfoot cell. The copper 
star in the bottom of the jar is filled in with cop- 
per sulphate and a solution, made up of a very 
little sulphuric acid dissolved in water, is poured 
into the jar until it covers the zinc. 
When the circuit of this cell is closed the sul- 
phuric acid acts on the zinc and forms zinc sul- 
phate, and as this is lighter than the copper sul- 
phate, it remains on top of the latter solution; as 
the difference in the weight of the two solutions 
keeps them separated it is called a gravity cell. 
At the same time that zinc sulphate is formed on 
the zinc element, metallic copper is deposited on 
the copper element, and there is an increase of 
zinc sulphate that corresponds exactly to the loss 
of the copper sulphate.

bon, i iron, ete.; now when an acid’ ‘electrolyte i is 
used; as in the Bunsen and gravity cells, a chem- 
ical-action is set up between the i impure particles ‘ 
and the zinc atoms. This gives rise to’ what: is 
called local action, which means that each pair of 
these little couples act as the elements of a mi-: 
nute cell and set up a current. This action of 
the electrolyte eats the zinc away and.at the same 
tithe it lessens the current output of the cell. To 
prevent this local action, Sturgeon, the British 
scientist who invented the electromagnet in 1832, 
washed the zinc with sulphuric acid and then 
rubbed mercury over its surfaces. This process, 
which is called amalgamation, because the zine 
and mercury form an amalgam, brings the pure 
zinc to the surface and at the same time it covers 
the impure particles; it also forms a smooth, 
bright surface which soon becomes covered with a 
fila of hydrogen and this protects the zinc except 
when the cell is in action.

—While a primary cell generates a current by 
the’chemical action of the electrolyte on the zinc 
élement: and, consequently, both the zinc and the 
electyolyte are used up, on the other hand the sec- |

storage cell will deliver practically the same 
amount of current as that which was used in 
charging it. 
ran fist storage oo was made_by Gaston Planté, of France, in 1860. His cell consisted 
@ pair of lead plates separated with a sheet of 
felt and all of which were rolled up together and 
then immersed in dilute sulphuric acid. This 
cell: was at.once simple and compact and it was 
efficient, too, but it had the great drawback of 
having to be charged and discharged many times 
before it would deliver anywhere nearly the same 
amount of current that was passed into it. The 
chemical action that took place in preparing the 
lead plates was this: A current was passed 
through the cell until one of the lead plates was 
changed into lead peroxide and the other one was 
changed into spongy lead. To save the time and 
current required for this operation Camille 
Faure, also of France, made the important im- 
provement, twenty years later, of pasting a layer 
of lead peroxide to one of the lead plates and of 
spongy lead to the other plate. The trouble 
with the Faure céll was that the active material, 
as the lead peroxide and spongy lead is called, 
disintegrated, that is it broke up, not only by the 
chemical action but on being moved about.

kinds of stgrage cells : and these aze-the lead cell

snd the eickel-steel cell. A lead cell is made up 
of two elements called grids; both of these grids 
are formed of sheets of lead punched full of 
holes, or which have grooves cut in them, The 
positive grid is filled with lead peroxide, while 
- those of the negative grid are filled with spongy 
lead, that is pure lead which is finely divided. 
Two. or more positive grids are placed parallel 
with, but are separated from, each other by about. 
half an inch and all are joined together at one 
end by a lead connection, called a strap, to which 
. a. terminal wire or cable can be attached. This 
bunch of grids is called the positive group. 
_. Next, the same number of negative grids are 
connected together in the same way as the posi- 
tive grids, and this is called the negative group. 
The two groups are then pushed together so that 
their grids alternate and to keep them apart thin 
boards, called separators, are slipped in between 
each pair, when the element is complete. The 
element is next set into a jar which contains an 
/ electrolyte made of sulphuric acid and water 
when the cell is ready for service.

'  4nto lead peroxide, and the lead peroxige of the: 
negative plate into spongy lead. To obtain a 
-eurrent from the cell all you need to do is to close 
_ the circuit when a chemical reaction takes place - 
_ and the spongy lead of the negative grid changes’ 
back into lead peroxide, and the lead peroxide 
. of the positive plate changes back to spongy 
lead. From this you will see that the charging 
current is not stored up in the cell, but that it 
sets up a chemical action between the electrolyte 
- and the lead compounds so that when these again 
_ react on each other an electric current is pro- 
. duced, What is really stored up is chemical 
energy and not electricity. 
- The Edison Storage Cell—Because lead is 
heavy when compared with the same volume of 
other metals, and Jead grids tend to disintegrate 
after long or hard service, Thomas A. Edi- 
son, the great inventor, spent many years and 
much money in making a storage cell which 
would. be lighter for the same output and. which 
would not wear out. The plates of the Edison 
cell are made of sheet nickel-steel with holes 
punched in them and in which the active material 
isheld. The active materia] in the positive plates 
is nickel perowide and in the negative plates it is 
iron owide. All the positive plates are connected _ 
together in one group, and all of the negative 
plates are connected in another group, as in a

guage, as electroplating. To do electroplating 
you: need ‘a source of current and for experimen:

ity eell will do. You will also need a large 
ig solution, a couple of copper rods, 
that is a piece of the pure metal you

want to plate the object with, and finally, the 
object which you want to plate. Now make a 
plating bath by dissolving some copper sulphate 
in water and put it into the jar. 
-This done, lay the copper rods across the top 
of the jar and then connect them to the elements 
of the cell. On the bar that is connected with 
the carbon element hang the copper anode, and 
on the bar connected with the zinc element hang 
the object to be plated; just before doing so dip 
it into a boiling solution of sodiwm carbonate, * 
or just plain soda, as it is called, for it must 
" be perfectly clean and free from grease. Now 
the copper sulphate solution contains positively 
charged particles of copper, and. negatively 
charged sulphuric acid particles. When the 
current is turned on the positively charged copper 
particles are attracted to and deposited on the 
object to be plated suspended from a rod con- 
nected to the zine element of the cell. For each 
copper particle that is deposited from the solu- 
tion, a positively charged copper particle is 
passed from the copper anode to the solution, 
thus its strength is always the same. 
When common type is set up and a large num- 
ber of impressions are needed, an electrotype is 
generally made of it, for the type-metal’ is so

of antimony.

soft that the letters would soon lose 
edges, ‘To make an electrotype, an 
taken of the type that is set up with wax,’ 
latter is then brushed over with powdered graph- 
ite so that it will conduct a current of electricity. 
The wax impression is then hung in the plating 
bath and plated until a thin copper impression is_ 
formed of it which is exactly like the original 
type. The wax is melted away and the copper | 
impression is backed up with type-metal to. make 
it thicker and stronger.- Finally the plate is 
mounted on a wood block which will make it just 
type high, when the electrotype is finished and 
ready to be printed from. 
In plating with gold the anode is, of course, 
made-of pure gold and the bath is made of gold 
chloride.and sodiwm cyanide, which is a very 
poisonous compound, dissolved in water; and 
then to make the gold cling more easily to the ob- 
ject to be plated the latter is quicked, that is it is 
dipped into mercuric nitrate. The bath for sil- 
ver plating is made by dissolving silver nitrate 
and potassium cyanide in water. Plating with 
nickel is harder to do than plating with any of 
the above-named metals. The bath is made by 
dissolving double sulphate of nickel and ammo- 
nium and ammonium sulphate in water. 
What Goes On in the Bath—A plating bath 
of whatever kind is made up of a salt that is

formed by combining a metal with an acid. 
Thus copper sulphate is formed of the metal cop- 
per and sulphuric acid. Now when this com- 
pound is dissolved in water to make the bath it 
is decomposed by the water, that is broken up, 
into a positive part, the metal, and a negative 
part, the acid portion. The positive metal is at- 
tracted to the cathode, which is the negative pole, 
and in electroplating is formed of the article to 
be plated, while the anode, which is the positive 
pole and made of pure metal, attracts the nega- 
tive acid part, and there forms more of the 
copper sulphate. This is because salts are de- 
composed by water into an electro-positive, or 
‘metallic part, and an electro-negative, or non- 
metallic part. , 
The Hall Electrical Process—The Hall ap- 
paratus consists of a large iron tank lined with 
carbon, and this forms one of the poles to which 
the source of current is attached, the cathode. 
The melted cryolite and bauaite is poured into the 
tank and a number of large carbon rods, which 
forms the other pole, the anode, and is connected 
to the source of the current, is lowered into the 
mixture. The current of electricity is then passed 
from the carbon poles to the carbon lining, and so 
- goes through the mixture; the current decom-. 
poses the mixture when the aluminum falls to the ~ 
bottom of the tank, To produce the aluminum as

But there is another way, one that is more

to analyze some water first by passing a current 
of electricity through it when it will: be decom- 
posed, that is separated into its two component 
gases, namely, hydrogen and oxygen; further, 
you will find that there will be twice the volume 
of hydrogen in one of the test-tubes that there 
will be of oxygen in the other test-tube, and this 
shows that there are two atoms of hydrogen to 
each atom of oxygen (HO) in each molecule of 
water formed. This, then, is the analysis of 
water. 
Now take your eudiometer, which you will find 
described in Chapter II, and transfer the two 
‘gases which you have obtained by analysis into its 
tube, when they will simply form an explosive 
mixture; but what you want is to make them 
combine chemically, and to do this you need only 
to cause an electric spark to jump between the 
ends of the wires in the tube, and the gases will 
explode and combine and the result will be a 
small drop of clear liquid. This liquid is water 
and you will have produced it synthetically. It 
was by this experiment that Cavendish first 
showed the exact nature of water. Of course 
water is so plentiful there is no object in making 
it by synthesis except to prove that it is formed 
of hydrogen and oxygen, so the process remains a 
laboratory experiment.

of being able to combine various elements so that 
they: will form compounds that are identical with 
natural ones is to give us a cheaper or a more 
abundant supply of them than we can get from 
Nature’s storehouse. Now it is a far easier mat- 
ter'to analyze a compound. and find out exactly 
what elements it is formed of than it is to take the 
elements and make the same number of atoms of 
them combine to form the original compound. 
Where only two elements are needed to make 
a compound, as hydrogen and oxygen to form 
water, mercury and iodine to form mercuric 
iodide, or copper and sulphur to form copper 
sulphide, the processes are easy and no skill is 
required to work them out, for a simple chemical 
action takes place; in the case of water this is 
produced by an electric spark; in mercuric sul- 
phide by rubbing the elements together hard, and 
in copper sulphide by dipping copper into melted 
sulphur. But where a reaction between the ele-

where'an element of the first compound must act

chief ingredients of black gunpowder. Before 
the Crimean War broke out in 1825 potassium 
nitrate had been chiefly obtained from India, and 
there had always been enough to supply all the 
armies of the world. But when the war was on, 
France ran short of it and offered a prize to 
anyone who could make it. , 
Now there was a plentiful supply of potassium 
chloride, which looks very much like sodium chlo- 
ride (common salt) and has about the same prop- 
erties, and sodium nitrate, that is Chili saltpeter, 
so there was devised a method of making potas- 
sium nitrate from these. When strong solutions 
of potassium chloride and sodium nitrate were

How Synthetic Camphor is Made.—You have 
read in Chapter VII that camphor is a gum 
made by chopping up and distilling the wood of 
_the camphor tree and that for many years the
-P-A-G-E-222
  SYNTHETIC CHEMISTRY. 198 
Japariese government practically controlled the 
entire output of camphor and so was able to 
make it pay an enormous revenue. Now each 
camphor molecule consists of 10 atoms of car- 
bon, 16 atoms of hydrogen and 1 atom of oxy- 
gen, or to write it as a formula, C,hH,O. Cam- 
phor trees, as you know, do not grow in the 
United States but we have great forests of pine 
trees and these give us all the turpentine we want 
and to spare. 
But what, you may ask, has turpentine to do 
with camphor? Just this, each molecule of tur- 
pentine is composed of 10 atoms of carbon and 
16 atoms of hydrogen, or expressed in the short- 
hand of the chemist, C,H. As you can see, the 
only difference between camphor and turpentine 
is that the former has one atom of oxygen to each 
molecule[ formed by the carbon and hydrogen 
atoms, whereas the latter has none. It must be 
clear now, if you can supply the extra atom of 
oxygen to the turpentine you will have produced 
camphor. To make a given number of atoms 
eombine with the molecules of certain other ele- 
ments, and especially with the molecules of cer- 
tain other compounds is often a hard thing to do 
_but it can be done if you hit upon the right way 
to go about it and this is generally done by mak- 
ing a series of experiments. 
~ Some twenty years ago Bradley and Lovejoy,
-P-A-G-E-223
194 WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY 
two American chemists, tackled the problem and 
after long and continuous experimenting they 
worked out a process for making synthetic cam- 
phor. They started with turpentine and oxalic 
acid, which latter is formed of 2 atoms of car- 
bon, 2 atoms of hydrogen and 4 atoms of oxy- 
gen, (C;H,0,). From this formula you will see 
that oxalic acid is formed of one-half oxygen by 
weight and since it is a vegetable acid, it probably 
gives up it8 oxygen more easily when it is acted 
upon by other vegetable compounds than it 
would if it were a mineral acid. 
The turpentine and oxalic acid are put into a 
steam-heated vat, which is lined with asbestos to 
keep in the heat, and when this reaches a tem- 
perature around the boiling point they combine 
and form pinol oxalate and pinol formate, both 
oily liquids. Next sodium hydrowide, which is a 
base, is put into the vat and the steam is again 
turned on. In this last operation the oxygen 
atoms of the oxalic acid combine with the atoms 
of the carbon and hydrogen of the turpentine in 
the proper proportion, when camphor molecules 
result; the camphor thus made is erude and 
mixed up with various kinds of aromatic oils, 
that is heavy, sweet-smelling oils which are used 
for perfuming soaps and the like. 
+ Oxalic acid is largely made from sawdust which latter will 
yield more than half its weight of crystals of this salt.

. To separate the crude camphor, which is now 
 ealled borneol, from the oils, the mass is dis- 
tilled, that is it is heated until it vaporizes when 
the vapor is condensed. But there is more to the 
distillation process than simply heating the com- 
pound, vaporizing and condensing it, for in order 
to save all of the aromatic oils a process called 
fractional distillation must be used. Now dif- 
ferent compounds have different boiling points , 
and, consequently, they vaporize at different 
temperatures. The lightest oil passes over. first 
and this is cooled and run off; then the tempera- 
ture. is raised and the next heavier oil is vapor- 
ized, cooled and run off, and this process is re- 
’ peated until all the different oils, or fractions, as 
they are called, have been obtained. The com- 
pound which rernains behind in the still is real 
camphor but it is still far from being as pure and 
white as camphor distilled from the camphor 
tree. 
-. Brown sugar is just as sweet as white granu- 
lated:sugar but no one wants to use brown sugar 
in his coffee if he can possibly get refined sugar 
even though the former is cheaper. The same 
preference holds good for camphor, and the 
public. will. not buy it if it is not just 
as white as the natural product. So the brown 
synthetic camphor must be refined; this is done 
by: cting every vestige of the oils that re-

main behind after distillation by forcing it 
through a filter press. Still the camphor is 
not perfectly white and to get rid of the remain- 
ing trace of color it is slowly evaporated and this 
drives out the water that contains the remaining 
impurities which color it. The final operation is 
to force a stream of air across the liquid camphor 
in the evaporating pan and this blows particles 
of it into a chamber where they are crystallized 
into snow-white flakes of pure camphor. 
Making Synthetic Rubber —The uses of rub- 
ber are so many that there never was a time when 
it was a drug on the market, and since the motor- 
car has become the common mode of transporta- 
tion the demand for it has increased by leaps and 
bounds. There are two ways by which more 
rubber can be had and these are (1) to plant 
more rubber trees, and (2) make it synthetically. 
Now caoutchouc, that is raw rubber, as it comes 
from the tree (see Chapter IV) has the formula 
of CisHis, which means that each rubber molecule 
is made up of 10 atoms of carbon and 16 atoms 
of hydrogen. : 
The nearest compound to rubber is a liquid 
called isoprene which has a chemical formula of 
CsH,; in other words it takes just half the num- 
ber of carbon atoms and hydrogen atoms to make 
up a molecule of it as it takes to make up a mole- 
cule of rubber. Isoprene can be obtained from
-P-A-G-E-226
“SYNTHETIC CHEMISTRY. 197 
e of a number of different gaseous, liquid 
and solid compounds, such as acetylene, ethylene 
and benzene, all of which belong to the same 
family of hydrocarbons, It can also be made 
from turpentine and plants that contain starch. 
Acetylene, which is made by the reaction of 
caleium carbide and water, has a formula of 
C,H; ethylene, which is found in mineral, coal 
and water gas, has a formula of C2H., while ben- 
‘zene, or benzole as it is sometimes called, is ob- 
‘tained from coal-tar when illuminating gas is 
mage;-it isa liquid and has a formula of CsHe. 
- Turpentine, as you have just learned, is formed 
of CyH,y, which is, curiously, exactly the same as _ 
the formula for rubber; it is obtained from pine 
trees, while starch, which is found in the roots of 
various plants, like the potato, the base of leaves, 
like: the-:onion and certain seed, like corn, is built 
up of C.H,.O;. It is easy to see that all of these 
compounds have in them the necessary elements 
for making rubber, although the number of atoms 
of carbon usually falls short of the number that 
& contained in a molecule of rubber. 
- Since turpentine and rubber have exactly the 
same. number of atoms of carbon and hydrogen 
atoms i in the make-up of their molecules you may 
why one is a liquid with a certain set of - 
3, and the other is a solid with another 
Properties. ‘The reason is that the carbon    
       
-P-A-G-E-227
198 WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY | 
atoms are arranged in them differently, so that in 
order to make rubber you must not only have the 
same number of carbon atoms in each molecule of 
your synthetic compound as there are in the 
natural one but they must be held together in 
precisely the same fashion. This adds to the in- 
terest of the problem and the difficulty of suc- 
cessfully solving it. _ 
A story has been going the rounds of the rub- 
-ber world for the last thirty years to the effect 
_ that Prof. Tilden, a British chemist, had found 
pieces of rubber in a bottle of isoprene, made 
from turpentine, which he had placed on a shelf. 
But try as he would the Professor was unable to 
again induce the isoprene to change into rubber, 
though he probably set a good many bottles of it 
on the shelf thereafter.. So he has had to be 
content ever since to bask in the reflected 
glory of having been the first to observe the 
change. 
In 1894, Dr. Matthews, of Manchester Uni- 
versity, attacked the problem in a different way 
—the experimental way. He didn’t wait for 
isoprene to change of its own accord into rubber 
but he finally found that it would change over by 
heating it with the metal sodium. As a cheap 
process for making metal sodium had been dis- 
eovered by Castner in 1886 the cost of this ele- 
ment was of small consequence, but the. trouble
-P-A-G-E-228
     - SYNTHETIC CHEMISTRY 199 
that isoprene obtained from turpentine was 
‘pensive a raw material to start-with. 
1 Since isoprene from turpentine was too costly’ 
to: amake synthetic rubber a commercial success, 
the next effort was to extract it (isoprene) from 
starch, and this in turn was obtained from the 
potato, which contains about twenty per cent of 
it."Eo get the isoprene from the starch it was 
fermented by means of yeast when it was con- 
verted into fusel oil, which is a kind of poisonous 
alcohol. By treating the fusel oil with chlorine 
isaprene results. : 
“Another way to make synthetic rubber is to 
acetone, a liquid compound whose formula is 
C,H,O; this is made by heating calcium acetate 
-and lime. ‘Now when acetone and acetylene gas 
_are chemically combined the resulting compound 
is isoprene. During the World War when. the 
supply of rubber from Brazil and Africa was cut ' 
off from Germany, her chemists made synthetic 
tubber from acetone and acetylene gas in consid- 
erable quantities, but it was far from being up to 
- the standard and it cost much more than the 
ral | product i in times of peace.

THE MAGIC OF COAL-TAR

for cooking and lighting purposes, the “gas

borhood because of the vile-smelling refuse.

What a Ton of Coal Contains—When illu- 
minating gas is made, bituminous coal, that is 
soft coal (see Chapter III) is placed in a retort 
and distilled. When heat is applied to the re- 
  tort the coal is made successively to yield 
various solid, liquid and gaseous compounds. 
The four chief products obtained from the de- 
structive distillation of the coal, as it is called, are 
illuminating gas, ammoniacal liquid (see Chapter 
VIII), coal-tar and coke and all of these com-

it. Picric acid (see Chapter VII) is exten- 
sively used in peace times as a yellow dye for silk 
and wool and it was in great demand during the 
War as an explosive. 
Benzene and Aniline—Benzene, or benzole, 
as it was formerly called, is one of the lighter 
oils that comes from coal-tar. Benzene dissolves 
raw rubber and when acted on by dilute sulphur 
chloride the rubber hardens in very much the 
same way as when it is heated, that is vulcanized 
(see Chapter IX). This process is called cold 
vulcanizing, or cold curing, which is a better 
name. But benzene has a far more important 
use than that of curing rubber, and this is to con- 
vert it into nitro-benzene. To make this com- 
pound the benzene is treated with nitrie acid 
when a heavy, oily liquid results which has an 
odor very much like that of bitter almonds. It 
is from nitro-benzene that aniline is produced 
and from this compound, which is a colorless oil, 
aniline dyes of many colors are made. 
Aniline is one of the seven wonders of chemical 
discovery, as you will shortly see. To make it 
from nitrp-benzene iron borings from a lathe, 
and hydrochloric (muriatic) acid are put to- 
gether with the nitro-benzene into a chamber, and 
the steam is turned on. By the action of the hy- 
drochloric acid on the iron, hydrogen is set free 
by the former and this combines with the nitro-

© Coal-Tar Dyes Were Discovered.— 
Aw back in the middle of the last century a 
boy of:eighteen named William Perkin who was 
anardent amateur chemist got a great idea. The 
sole supply of quinine was then and is yet made 
of Peruvian bark; as it was very scarce at that 
time; and therefore costly, young Perkin 
ed that it was possible to make the drug 
ing together certain other compounds— 
to produce it synthetically.. If he could 
fortune was ready and waiting for him 
gan working with this end in view. In 
iis. experiments he treated aniline with 
dichromate, a red salt formed of the 
potassium, the metal chromium’ and

precipitate, which not more than one

to which he gave the name of mauve. He called 
_ it mauve from the French flower of that name, 
but which we know as the mallow. ‘This then 
was the first coal-tar dye and for a long time it 
was widely used for dyeing silk and wool, but 
owing to its tendency to fade in the sunlight it 
has been displaced by other and faster dyes. 
The Discovery of Magenta.—The success of 
the new dye spread like wildfire, and other chem- 
ists everywhere tried to duplicate it by using 
other agents than potassium dichromate to oxi- 
dize the aniline oil. First Renard and Faure of 
France used arsenic, a brittle, steel gray element 
whose properties are very much like phosphorus, 
with the aniline, but instead of getting mauve 
they obtained that wonderful crimson dye known 
as magenta. The dye itself, however, does not 
contain any arsenic but is a salt formed when 
rosaniline combines with an acid. Not only is 
magenta used directly for dyeing but, like ani- 
line, it forms the starting point for making many 
other dyes. One of the dyes made from it in the 
early days was called phosphine which gave a 
beautiful orange color. It is not called by that 
name now as phosphine in the chemistry of to-day ~ 
is a gaseous phosphoretted hydrogen. Another 
early aniline dye was Nicholson’s blue, but in- 
stead of producing the color direct, the goods 
were first dipped into the dye, which was

thuric acid when the blue color

_ Dyes and Explosives from Toluene.— 
Toluene, or toluol as it is often called, is a color- 
less, inflammable liquid that is very much like 
benzene; when it is treated in the same way, that 
is. with nitric acid, it is changed into nitrotoluene 
and-from this aniline is likewise produced. Al- 
though only 3 of a pound of naphthalene can be 
chad from a ton of coal and 8 pounds of toluene 
can be had from the same amount, a process for 
making indigo from the last named compound 
was discarded in favor of the first because it was 
_in great demand for making trinitrotoluene, that 
jis, the explosive commonly called TNT. So 
we get our synthetic indigo not from toluene but 
from naphthalene. The difference between 
‘nitrotoluene and trinitrotoluene is that the tolu- 
ene of the first has only one group of nitrogen 
and oxygen atoms combined with it, while the sec- 
ond has three groups of nitrogen and oxygen 
-atoms.. When three groups of nitrogen atoms 
are combined with the toluene the compound be- 
comes. very unstable and this accounts for its 
explosiveness. 
Alizarin from Anthracene-—For many years 
to 1869 a plant called madder was culti-

vated on a large scale in India, Turkey, Persia 
and some parts of Southern Europe. Its value 
lay in its roots which contained a coloring com- 
pound that was used as a dye to produce the - 
far-famed Turkey red. As early as 1828 Robi- 
quet and Colin, of France, isolated the active 
principle of the madder root that actually pro- 
duced the red color; this they called Alizarin, 
from alazari, which is the Arabic name for T'ur- 
key red, but what the crystals were made of they 
did not know. 
Then four years later Dumas and Laurent 
sueceeded in extracting a new compound from 
coal-tar and to this the name of anthracene was 
given. The next gap, and it was'a big one, was 
bridged shortly before 1869 by Graebe and Lie- 
bermann, of Germany, who distilled some ali- 
zarin, made from madder, with xine dust and 
obtained anthracene. This was the key that un- 
locked an entirely new series of dyes, for since 
anthracene could be had from alizarin it ought 
to be possible to reverse the direction of the reac- 
tion and convert anthracene into alizarin; and 
this the chemists did without any great trouble. 
It was the first time in history that a dye made 
by nature had been duplicated synthetically by 
man.

It is now made from light oil and creosote 
oil; the latter is the residue that is left behind 
after anthracene is separated from the crude oil. 
To obtain naphthalene from these oils caustic soda 
is thoroughly mixed with them and this dissolves 
out the phenol (carbolic acid) and the cresol 
(eresylic acid) that is in them. The mixture 
then separates into water, with the acids in it, at 
the bottom of the vat and the oil, which contains 
the naphthalene, on top.

more costly camphor as an insecticide, and this is . _ 
the compound that moth-balls are made of. It

is in making dyes and many tons of it are used 
for this purpose every year. Nor are naph- 
thalene dyes by any means limited to a single 
color but range from the most delicate yellows to 
the brightest reds and greens.

  “the indigo that was used came from a bushy 
plarit: which was originally found inthe East 
Indies, and so it was called indigo. ° 
_ “Phe coloring matter was extracted from the.

pete with nature. Then in 1894 the Badische 
Anilin und Soda Fabrik, of Germany, took it up 
and after spending several million dollars and 
fifteen years in research work its chemists evolved 
a commercial process for making synthetic in- 
digo; and the indigo it made was not only better 
than natural indigo but it was so much cheaper 
that the indigo growers had to go the way of the 
madder growers—that is out of business. 
The starting point for making indigo is, then, 
naphthalene but as the process is complicated and 
the reactions numerous we shall only give you an 
outline of it. First the naphthalene is changed 
into phthalic (pronounced thal-ic) acid by heat- 
ing it with sulphuric acid and a little mercury. 
The phthalic acid is then heated to drive off the 
water in it when it becomes phthalic anhydride. 
_ (An anhydride is a compound which when dis- 
solved in water forms an acid.) The anhydride is 
next changed into phthalimide by heating it with 
ammonia and this, in turn, is converted into 
anthranilic acid by treating it with caustic soda 
and chlorine. 
Now by means of monochloracetie acid the 
anthranilic acid is changed into phenyl-glycine 
ortho-carborylic acid, which is called phenyl- 
glycine acid for short. This latter compound i is 
melted with caustic potash which then gives 
indowyl, and this is getting pretty close to indigo.

Making Drags from Coal-Tar.—Not only are 
beautiful colors obtained from coal-tar but won- 
derful drugs as well. You will remember that 
William Perkin was at work trying to make 
quinine from aniline when he discovered he had 
produced mauve. instead. Now while chemists 
have never been able to make quinine from coal- 
tar the work they did along this line has resulted 
in’ some new and even more valuable drugs. 
There is a compound extracted from coal-tar - 
‘called quinoline and it is from this that chemists . 
have long tried to obtain quinine. Instead, they 
discovered among others a drug known as thallin 
which was. once used as a remedy for yellow 
fever, but the after-effect of the drug on the 
patient was nearly as bad as the disease and its 
use was; for this reason, given up. The first coal- . 
tar drug to find a permanent place on the drug- 
gists’ shelf was antipyrin. This drug was made 
by Dr. Knorr, of Germany, in 1888, from aniline 
and it hag been largely used ever since instead of 
: i BS a.cold and fever remedy and for re= 
  
-P-A-G-E-241

Then acetanilide, or antifebrine as it is some- 
times called, was discovered in the same works 
where the manufacture of antipyrin was carried 
on. It is extracted from aniline by treating the 
latter with acetic acid. It is also used as a 
remedy for fever and is especially useful in 
neuralgia. Carbolic acid, as you read earlier in 
this chapter, is one of the crudes that is obtained 
by distilling coal-tar. “Salicylic acid was for- , 
merly obtained from the bark of the willow tree, 
but Kobe made it from carbolic acid in 1874 so 
that it is to-day a synthetic product. About 
1904 Adolph von Bayer produced a new drug 
which he called aspirin; it has a wide and ever 
growing use as a headache remedy and it is espe- 
cially good in neuritis and rheumatism. Its 
curative property is due to the salicylic acid in it. 
Aspirin is simply a trade name given it, for it is 
really acetyl salicylic acid and is formed by the 
action of acetic acid on salicylic acid. 
Phenacetin is another acetyl compound made 
from carbolic acid. It is older than aspirin and 
is a quicker and more certain remedy for head- 
ache than the latter, but it also has a greater effect 
on the heart and should, therefore, only be used 
by persons who have no heart trouble... Among 
other coal-tar drugs are soporifics such as vero-

Scents, that is fragrant scents, and flavors are 
so closely related that they are usually consid- 
ered together, but here we shail treat them 
separately and tell you how they are obtained 
from nature as well as how they are made: by 
chemical synthesis. In the first place, you may 
or may not know that the words smell and odor 
do not mean the same thing. 
Your nose is the organ of smell and it contains 
the olfactory nerves which lead to your brain. In 
order for these nerves to excite the sensation of 
smell in the brain-cells the odorous substance, or 
compound, must be capable of giving off minute 
particles, that is molecules of it, and these must 
come into direct contact with them. Gaseous 
compounds do this the most readily—in fact too 
readily. Liquids vaporize easily and perfumes 
are, for this reason, chiefly formed of them, while 
some solids give off their molecules but to a very 
much lesser extent. Now while it is usually easy 
to describe what the eyes see, the ears hear and 
the hands feel, it is a very different matter to de-

add some caustic potash to it. Now heat it over 
the flame of an alcohol lamp or a Bunsen burner, 
when the alkali, as the potash is called, will com- 
bine with the oil and soft soap will be formed. 
Finally the fixed oils cannot be dissolved in ether 
or alcohol, while the volatile oils dissolve easily 
in either of them. 
Essential oils of which perfumes and flavoring 
extracts are made are volatile oils, and before the 
days of coal-tar chemistry they were obtained 
from plants; for instance, the essential oil of 
violet was produced from fresh violets, the es- 
sential oil of roses, or attar of roses as it is called, 
was made from fresh roses, In some plants the 
oil is contained in the seed, in others in the leaves 
and still in others in the roots. It is these essen- 
tial oils or the active principles in them, that give 
various kinds of flowers their sweet odors. 
Some Coal-Tar Perfwmes——Now some, if not 
all, of the essential oils can be made from coal- 
tar crudes, and those obtained by the chemist are 
just as sweet and delicate as those produced by 
nature. The processes by which chemists make 
them are identical with those by which he manu- 
factures synthetic dyes, and aniline furnishes the 
raw material for the starting point of many of 
them. \ :

exactly like the lilac and lily of the valley, hence 
they are largely used in making perfumes that 
go by these attractive names. In making terpin- 
eol, turpentine oil is taken as the starting point 
and on adding to this a solution of alcohol and 
nitric acid there crystallizes out of it a compound - 
called terpin, hydrate. By hydrate is meant a 
compound that is formed by the union of mole- 
cules of water with the molecules of some other 
compound in which the arrangement of the | 
atoms is not disturbed. Next water and a small 
quantity of sulphuric acid are added to the terpin . 
hydrate when the solution is distilled; this gets 
rid of the water and the thick liquid left behind 
is terpineol; when this is cooled it crystallizes and 
is ready to be made into lilac or lily of the valley 
perfume. 
Scent of Attar of Roses——This fragrant es- 
sential oil is obtained from the petals of roses; it 
was originally a product of Persia, which ac- 
counts for its name, for atar in the Persian lan- 
guage means breath perfume, or its equivalent. 
Later it was made in different oriental countries, 
especially in Arabia and in India. It is also 
called otto of roses perhaps for the reason that 
-when the Germans began to make it synthetically 
they thought it fitting to Germanize the name. 
Attar of roses made from fresh flowers is enor- 
mously expensive for it takes 2 hundred. pounds
-P-A-G-E-248
PERFUMES AND FLAVORS 219 
of rose petals to make one-fourth of an ounce of 
it. 
-Although the essential oil of the rose is made 
up of nearly two dozen different compounds, 
geraniol is the chief one. It is a colorless, odor- 
Jess essence and is the one that gives geranium 
oit and rose oil their pleasing and distinctive 
scents. When geraniol is oxidized it. gives citral 
from which ionone is formed, and ionone, in turn, 
is the synthetic essence of which practically all 
. Violet waters and violet perfumes are made. To 
oxidize a, compound means that it is made to com- 
bine chemically with oxygen. 
It was in one of the great laboratories of Ger- 
many that the essential oil of the rose was first 
analyzed, that is each one of its active principles, 
or essences, was isolated; and this having been 
_ done the chemists proceeded to reverse the proc- 
ess and synthetize the essential oil, that is to build 
it up out of its various elements and compounds. 
And so excellent is the product that the expert: 
olfactory organs of the perfumer cannot tell the 
one that man has made from the one that nature 
has made. The only difference is that the first 
_ costs in the neighborhood of five dollars a pound 
and the second costs something like five hundred 
dollars a pound. 
Scent of the Violet —The essential oil of fresh

toilet waters and violet perfumes are the most 
plentiful scents on the market. How is it? The 
secret is not hard to discover for the essential , 
oil is now made in laboratories by the ton, and 
so when you pay two dollars for a ‘small bottle ° 
of toilet water, or five or six dollars for a still 
. smaller bottle of violet perfume you don’t need 
to feel that the perfumer is cheating himself., 
Whirty years ago two German chemists, Tie- 
mann and Kriiger, began to analyze the essential 
oil of the violet to find out exactly what it was 
made of. The first difficulty they encountered 
was that they could not get enough of the oil to 
experiment with. Now there is a plant with 
sword-like leaves that is called the ris, or fleur- 
de-lig and whose root is known as orris-root. 
The root of the East Indian species when dried 
has about the same odor as that of the violet and, 
hence, the essential oil in it must be the same as 
that of the former. When they had isolated the 
active principle they called it irone and it was 
found that each molecule of it was made up of 18 
atoms of carbon, 20 atoms of hydrogen and 1 
atom of oxygen, or C,H,O. 
While working on the synthetic production of 
irone another compound was discovered whose 
odor was identical with that of fresh violets and 
to this they gave the name of ionone. This com- 
pound is made by heating citral and acetone to-

gether with caustic'’soda when pseudo-ionone is 
formed. (Pseudo means false and, hence, the 
name means literally false-ionone.) However 
false it may be, when it is boiled with sulphuric 
acid it breaks up into two compounds both of 
which are ionone but each of which is a shade 
different from the other. The first is known as 
a tonone, that is alpha ionone, and the second as 
8 ionone, or beta ionone. These two ionones are 
as alike as two peas, even the arrangement of the 
atoms of their molecules being the same, but there 
is one atom more of hydrogen in the # ionone 
than there is in the « ionone. To the ordinary 
person the odors of these ionones smell exactly 
alike but a perfumer can detect a slight differ- 
ence. . 
_ The « ionone is exceedingly sweet and its odor 
is precisely that of the essential oil of fresh violets 
while the @ionone is a shade less sweet and re- 
fined. and this is used for scenting toilet soaps. 
Again when the two ionones are mixed together 
they are sold as the oil of orris-root. 
Scents of Other Flowers.—The odors of many 
other flowers are also produced synthetically. 
Thus the odor of the heliotrope is duplicated by 
. a compound called piperonal; this is a white, 
erystalline compound that is formed by oxidizing 
-piperic acid. (which is obtained from the pepper 
plant) with potassium permanganate. Piperonal

. is very closely allied to vanillin, a flavoring ex- 
tract which will be described shortly. Neroli is 
another interesting essential oil used in making 
perfumes. It is found in various flowers such as 
the jasmine, the tube-rose, and ylang-ylang, and 
is also obtained by distilling bitter orange. It is 
- made synthetically by treating anthranilic acid 
with methyl alcohol and hydrogen chloride. 
Some Coal-Tar Flavors.—We usually take the 
word flavor to mean a peculiar and pleasing 
quality of food that affects the sense of taste. 
As a matter of exact statement the flavor of food 
not only affects the sense of taste but in a large 
measure the sense of smell as well. To be able 
to sense the flavor of food it must be soluble, 
that is capable of being dissolved by the gastric 
juice of the mouth and it must then be brought 
into direct contact with the tongue and other 
parts of the mouth. 
The taste organs, or end-organs as they are 
ealled, which receive the stimulus of taste are 
formed of taste-buds, or gustatory buds, that are 
located principally on the upper surface and the 
edges of the tongue; there are also some taste 
buds on the soft palate and the larynx. These, 
sensory nerve buds are connected with the brain 
by three sets of cranial nerves, since many of the 
sensations of flavor that you get are really caused 
by the odors that are given off by the food after
-P-A-G-E-252
   PERFUMES AND FLAVORS 228 
& is dissolved in your mouth and carried up to 
| the olfactory nerves, 
“There are only four fundamental, that is dis- 
tinct tastes, and these are sweet and bitter, and 
sour and saline. The sweet and bitter tastes are 
set up by the chemical action of the food as it dis- 
solves, while the sour taste is the perception of 
acids, and the saline taste is the perception of 
salts and alkalis, The taste buds at the tip of the 
tongue. are most responsive to sweet flavors, 
those on the edges of the tongue respond best to 
‘sour flavors, those on top of the tongue to salt, - 
and those at the back of the tongue to bitter sub- 
stahees, 
The Flavor of Vanilla. —Soon after Perkin 
discovered how to make coumarin from coal-tar 
in 1868, Tiemann made vanillin which is the es- 
seutial oil of the vanilla pod. Now while 
vanillin can be built up of free carbon, hydrogen 
and oxygen and it can also be obtained from coal- 
tad, i takes a number of processes to do so which 
make ite production by these means too costly. 
 Seit is: produced by more simple means, that is 
the start. is made with eugenol, which is the es- 
sence of the oil of cloves, and by oxidizing the 
latter yanillin results. The fact that the starting 
compound .is obtained from a plant instead of 
does not make it any the less a synthetic 
for no matter whether the start is made 
     
-P-A-G-E-253
224 WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY, 
with the original free elements, from coal-tar or 
from plants, the resultant vanillin is in all re- 
spects identical] with that which is extracted from 
the vanilla pod. 
The Flavor of Wintergreen.—It takes a long 
stretch of the imagination to link up the essence 
of wintergreen with that of carbolic acid but the 
former is nevertheless now made from the latter. 
In other words, wintergreen is a coal-tar flavor. 
To make oil of wintergreen carbolic acid is 
treated with carbon dioxide which converts it into 
salicylic acid. Methyl alcohol, that is wood al- 
cohol, and sulphuric acid are next added to the 
salicylic acid and the mixture is heated, when 
methyl salicylate is produced and this is oil of 
wintergreen which is exactly the same as that 
obtained from wintergreen berries. 
Other Synthetic Flavors——Besides the flavors 
described above, there are many others made by 
the action of various kinds of acids on different 
alcohols. These combinations yield ethyl bu- 
tyrate which is the flavor of pineapple; amyl- 
acetate which is the flavor of the pear; while com- 
pounds of ether produce the flavors of straw- 
berry and other berries. As a matter of fact, 
there is not a flavor of any known plant which 
cannot be reproduced in the laboratory and 
many of them are made and sold in large quanti- 
ties. .

“phosphorus and obtained the metal calcium from 
their respective compounds,” as well as to have 
made calcium carbide. . 
‘How Calcium Carbide is Made.—In the chap- 
ter on How Plants Live and Grow we explained 
how ‘acetylene gas, which was once used for 
motor-car lighting and is now largely used in 
oxyacetylene welding is made. In making 
acetylene gas the calcium carbide is disinte- 
grated, that is broken down by the action of 
the water which falls drop by drop upon it; 
and now let us find out how calcium carbide is 
made. . 
Calcium is a metal and it is the fifth most 
plentiful element that goes to make up the 
earth’s crust; it is little known, however, as it is 
always: found combined with other substances, 
‘generally in limestone, marble, gypsum and 
ehalkc and it gets its name from vala which is the 
Latin, word for white and means lime. It is a 
“white metal like aluminum but so soft it can be 
“Ameaded with the fingers. Metallic calcium is 
ned by fusing calcium chloride in a graphite 
le. and passing an electric current through 
at it is itself an electric furnace product, 
an. element. :

the carbon of the coke and the calcium in the 
- quicklime combine, when calciwm carbide and 
carbon monowide are formed. The carbon mon- 
oxide is a gas and this is allowed to pass off into 
the air. The calcium carbide is a mass of crystals 
and these, when pure, are colorless; more often 
the carbide is only of fair quality, when they are 
a reddish color, and when of poor quality they 
have a grayish color. 
Making calcium carbide in the electric furnace 
remained a laboratory experiment until the 
dynamo, as a direct current electric machine is 
called, was invented. The manufacture of cal- 
cium carbide on a commercial scale, however, did 
not begin until electricity was generated cheaply 
by the great hydro-electric plant at Niagara 
Falls. The process of making calcium carbide 
on a commercial scale consists of breaking up the 
coke and lime into pieces about as large as stove 
coal and dumping them into an electric furnace. 
This is fotmed of a sheet-iron box, some six feet 
high with flanged wheels so that it can run on a 
track. The electrodes are made of graphite and 
are mounted so that they can be set into the 
furnace in an upright position. When the heat 
produced by the are reaches 3,500 degrees Cen- 
tigrade the carbon and calcium combine and 
form a liquid mass; the electrodes are now lifted 
out of the box and the latter is rolled away and
-P-A-G-E-260

another box charged with coke and lime is run 
into its place. In this way the same electrodes 
can be used continuously and no time is lost wait- . 
ing for the calcium carbide to cool. 
“How Carborundwm is Made—tif, now, in- ' 
stead of calcium there is used silica-in the form 
of crushed quartz or sand, and this is mixed with 
eoke and they are brought to a high enough tem- 
perature in an electric furnace, they will combine 
and form silicon carbide, which is a compound of 
silicon and carbon. This substance which is 
made up of crystals is harder than emery ‘and 
nearly as hard as the diamond. It makes, there- . 
fore, a fine abrasive and has all but supplanted 
ve ordinary whetstone and emery grinding 
   
   
    
   
     
    
   ‘ow. silicon carbide is best known in the 
ited States by the trade name of carborun- 
ym, and in Canada it is called carbolon. ‘While 
Hare’ was the first one to make carborundum 
ither knew what he had made nor did he 
‘a name. Indeed, it was not until 1885 _ 
e: Cowles Brothers made carborundum in

graphite electrodes i ina pot and packed sand'and 
charcoal around them; then he connected: the 
electrodes with a dysiamo and switched on the 
current. After twenty-four hours or so he 
switched off the current, took out the electrodes 
and found that they were covered with black, 
- steel-blue and deep yellow crystals the like of 
which Nature had never made and which re-_ 
flected the light like gems of the first water. He 
sold these crystals for nearly fifty cents an ounce 
and found a market for all he could make. Soon

How Graphite is Made.—-Carbon is one of the 
most plentiful elements. that go to make up the 
earth’s crust, and it is not only found in rocks of 
various kinds but one-half of dry plant matter is 
formed of it. While carbon is an element all 
carbon is not alike; there are three distinct forms, 
the diamond, graphite and what is called amor- 
phous carbon which means that it is not crystal- 
lized. The diamond is pure carbon that has been 
crystallized by heat and pressure, and it is the 
hardest substance known. Graphite, or black- 
lead, as it is, sometimes called, because it will 
mark on paper like lead and is used in making 
lead-pencils, is also a crystallized form of carbon, 
but it is entirely different from the diamond in 
that it is very soft and flaky. Because it is so 
soft and smooth it is used for lubricating ma- 
chinery where in some cases it is better than oil. 
It was M. Moissan, a French chemist, who 
found ‘that amorphous carbon could be changed 
into either diamond or graphite. The process he 
employed to make diamonds in the electric fur- 
nace will ‘be found in the chapter on Making 
Precious Stones. — 
- When carborundum is made in the electric 
furnace, graphite is formed around the core be- 
tween the electrodes which is the hottest part of
-P-A-G-E-266

the charge, and this led to the making of graphite 
in large quantities. Before this method of pro- 
ducing graphite was discovered nearly all of it 
was obtained from deposits at Ticonderoga, 
N. Y., Brandon, Vt., and Sturbridge, Mass., but 
the electric furnace product is superior to that 
which nature made, and further there is no limit 
to the amount of it. 
The way that graphite is produced is about 
like this, although chemists have not yet learned 
exactly what the reaction is: The silicon carbide 
is broken down by the high temperature, the sili- 
“eon of it being set free as a vapor and the carbon 
deposited as graphite. The electric furnace in 
_ which graphite is made at Niagara Falls is about 
‘two feet high and wide and thirty feet long and 
through each end there is fixed a. number of 
electrodes. Into this furnace is placed a charge 
oe f sand and anthracite coal (hard

grees Centigrade. Graphite electrodes which are 
used in electric arc furnaces are made in the same 
way as the loose graphite described above, only 
the charge is made up of petroleum, coke and 
sand and these substances are molded into rods of 
various sizes. The rods are then baked, when 
. they are laid in the furnace where the current 
converts them into graphite electrodes. 
How Phosphorus is Made.—Phosphorus in the 
form of calcium phosphate, commonly called 
‘phosphate of lime, is found in the bones of all 
animals in considerable quantities. While the 
element is a deadly poison, many of its com- - 
pounds are most beneficial, In times past it was 
obtained ‘by heating bones until they were white 
hot when the animal matter was burned out of 
them. 'To get the calcium out of them they are 
treated with sulphuric acid, when they are again 
Heated to a high temperature, this time with car- 
‘bon, when the pure phosphorus vaporizes and is 
caught and solidified under water. 
- Phosphorus is now made in the electric fur- 
nace either from bone-ash or mineral phosphate. 
Whichever material is used, the phosphate is 
mixed with sand and charcoal and then put into 
an electric furnace; the high temperature set up 
by ‘the are converts the charge into phosphorus 
vapor, carbon monogide and slag. The first is 
collected and condensed into a solid, the second,

top to the condensing chambers where it is cooled 
and becomes a liquid. 
Making Alkali in the Electric Furnace—This 
is a very recent process of making chlorine and 
, caustic soda in large quantities. Chlorine you 
will remember is one of the good gases, when it is 
not used for war operations, while caustic soda, 
whose chemical name is sodiwm hydrowide, is 
largely used in making soap from fats, for 
bleaching, preparing paper pulp and other pur- 
poses. In making chlorine and caustic soda in 
the electrolytic cell sodium chloride, which is our 
old friend common salt, is heated until it is 
melted. . 
In this is placed a carbon electrode, called the 
anode, to which the wire carrying the positive 
electricity from the dynamo is connected; the 
other electrode, called the cathode, to which the 
wire carrying the negative current from the dy- 
namo is connected, is formed of melted lead. 
The cell is made gas-tight and over the anede 
there is an outlet for the chlorine to pass out into 
a containing chamber. When the current is 
switched on it decomposes the sodium chloride 
and the chlorine passes off, while the sodium, 
which is a metal, mixes with the melted lead and 
forms an alloy. 
The melted alloy is then made to flow into an- 
other part of the cell where it is subjected to
-P-A-G-E-270
FURNACE PRODUCTS 287 
‘aw blast of steam and this reacts on the sodium and 
forms a solution of caustic soda and hydrogen. 
The caustic soda, which is lighter than the melted 
lead, is drawn off through a valve, when the lead 
is again returned to the chamber where it be- 
comes the cathode as before, while the hydrogen 
which has been set at liberty passes out through 
an outlet. 
The Making of Metallic Sodium—Two dif- 
ferent electric furnace processes have been de- 
vised for producing the metal sodium on a large 
scale and, hence, making it cheaply. The first of 
these is the Castner process, so-called because it 
was gotten up by H. N. Castner, of Brooklyn, 
“N.Y. In this process the caustic soda in a 
fused state is decomposed by the action of the 
--electric current, when the metallic sodium floats 
-upward through the melted solution. In the 
Ashcroft process the furnace consists of two 
-.geparate tanks connected by a pipe. ‘The melted 
sodium chloride (common salt) is decomposed by 
mearis of a lead cathode, when it forms an alloy 
with it as when alkalies are made. The melted 
alloy then flows through the pipe into the second 
where it comes into contact with the melted 
ic soda. Again it is decomposed by an elec- 
‘current, when the melted sodium is set free 
cathode and caustic soda is produced at the

Electric Furnace Smelting and Refining. —~ 
The electric furnace has been found very useful 
for smelting various ores and refining different 
metals. A furnace for smelting tin ores is con- 
structed in two parts so that they can be bolted 
together or taken apart. Further, it is provided 
with trunnions like a gun so that it can be turned 
a quarter way round. This allows the furnace to 
stand with the outlet on top when the ore is being 
smelted, and to turn over so that the tin will run 
out when it is on its side. Two large graphite 
electrodes are set in either side of the furnace and 
these are connected with a dynamo which gener- 
ates the current. . 
In making high-grade steel from low-; e 
steel the electric furnace has -proved of great 
value. The best known furnace for this purpose 
is the one invented by Herault, of France. The 
furnace is built up of a steel shell lined with fire- 
brick, and this is further lined with a thick layer 
of dolomite, that is a mineral which is formed 
chiefly of calcium carbonate and magnesium car- 
bonate and of which mountains are made, espe- 
cially the Swiss Alps. This type is useful be- 
cause the highest temperatures have little or no 
effect on it. 
Into this bowl-like shell is placed the low- 
grade steel that is to be refined, when the top, or 
roof, which is lined with fire-clay, is set on it and
-P-A-G-E-272

the current switched on to the graphite elec- 
' trodes. Now as low-grade steel contains sul- 
phur and phosphorus and it is these elements that 
make it brittle, they are made to combine with 
the bases, magnesia and lime, contained in the 
dolomite forming the slag under the great heat of 
the arc, which leaves the steel in a very pure state. 
The slag, which is then rich in phosphorus, can be 
usdd for making fertilizer.

SYNTHETIC ‘DIAMONDS ‘AND 
OTHER GEMS 
Lone before chemistry as we ‘know it to-day 
was born there were men who melted lead and 
sulphur together and mixed them with salt and 
mercury in the forlorn hope that from out of the 
mass, would come the yellow metal gold. 
ese old experimenters were called alchemists, 
and while they did not discover the art of trans- 
muting the baser metals into gold, the things they 
did find out finally led to modern chemistry, and 
this is worth more to the human race than all the 
precious metals that have been or ever will be 
’ taken from the earth or made by the future arts 
of man. The alchemists, then, did not live in 
vain. 
For many years after chemistry became a 
science those who practiced it confined their ef- 
forts almostewholly to breaking down substances 
and learning the elements of which they were 
formed—that is, they spent much of their time in 
analyzing them. In this way they came to know 
_-what elements the various mineral, plant and ani- 
‘mal substances were made of and, further, the

number of atoms of each element that makes up. 
a molecule of each substance. But as for taking 
certain elements and making their atoms combine 
in the right proportion to form old or new sub- 
stances—well, this savored altogether too much 
of the tactics of the ancient alchemist. 
Hence it is only within the last quarter of a 
century that chemists have worked toward the 
end of making atoms of various elements com- 
- bine as they wished them to, so that they would 
' form substances that Nature has produced or 
perhaps substances such as she never made, And 
why does the chemist want to perform these mod- 
ern miracles? The answer is so that we can have 
a purer supply, a more plentiful supply or a 
cheaper supply of a substance that is either 
‘searce, impure or costly, or for all of these rea- 
is put together. The making of different sub- 
stances by combining the required number of 
Aa Se various elements is called synthetic     
     
      
     
   What. Diamonds Are Made Of.fLong ago 
ei learned that diamonds are “formed of 
ly. pure carbon which had been crystal- 
d:by heat and pressure. In making experi- 
ts with. carbon, which is an element, they

They further found that all of these forms of 
earbon unite with exactly the same quantity of 
oxygen when they are heated in the open air and, 
finally, that each of the kinds of carbon could be 
changed into charcoal. 
Now carbon, you will remember, is one of the 
most plentiful elements in the earth’s crust, but 
diamond, the crystallized kind, is one of the rarest 
of substances, Again, each of the three kinds of 
-earbon has properties and characteristics all its 
own.’ Graphite is soft to the touch and crystal- 
lized; charcoal and other carbon forms are more 
or less hard and opaque, while the diamond is the 
hardest of all known substances and transparent. 
Diamonds are mined chiefly in Brazil, South Af- 
rica and Borneo, while a few of them have been 
found in Georgia and North Carolina. 
Wherever they are found they are covered 
with a dense, brown-colored crust, like the shell 
of a hazelnut, which looks very much like a peb- 
ble. To get out the diamond you have to break 
the crust just as you have to crack the shell of a 
nut to get out the kernel. The diamond itself is 
generally round and transparent and most of 
them are slightly colored, usually a yellowish _ 
tint, though some of them are a bluish-white, 
’ while others are brown and black. Occasionally 
one is found that is perfectly clear and colorless 
and without a flaw. Such a stone is called a dia-

Making Diamonds in the Electric Furnace— 
ein chemists have tried just as hard to make 
mds as. ever the alchemist worked to make 
d out of lead and they have succeeded just a 
ale better. Though diamonds are formed of 
n in the pure state, no process has yet been 
y which they could be made large enough 
any commercial value as an abrasive 
less. as an ornament. As long as half a 
ago when the electric battery was new, 
sometimes found diamonds in various 
‘compounds through which they had 
an electric current, but they were so

small that a microscope was necessary to see 
them. , 
The first attempt to produce diamonds in an 
electric furnace since the invention of the dy- 
namo was made by Henri Moissan, a French 
chemist, in 1894. He examined very carefully 
into the schemé that Nature employed in making 
her diamonds, and found that she did so by heat- 
ing carbon to a very high temperature and let- 
ting it cool under an enormous pressure. So 
Moissan built a small electric furnace the shell 
of which was of iron, and into this he set a block 
of carbonate of lime on which high temperatures 
have small effect. In the middle of the block of 
lime he made a hole just large enough to hold a 
small graphite crucible. The graphite electrodes, 
which were an inch in diameter and twelve inches 
long, rested on top of the block of lime so that 
when the current was switched on, the are would 
form directly over the mouth of the crucible; a 
cover made of a slab of lime was placed on top of 
the furnace and this completed the equipment. 
He next made a mixture of a small amount of 
powdered Swedish iron, which is the purest ob- 
tainable, and an equal amount of powdered char- 
coal, made from sugar to insure its being pure. 
This charge he put into the crucible which in turn 
he set in the furnace. 'Then he switched on the 
electric current and started the arc. The latter
-P-A-G-E-278
DIAMONDS AND OTHER GEMS 245 
took a thousand amperes (quantity of electric- 
ity) at five hundred volts (pressure of electric- 
‘ity). Thus the power used by the are was equal 
to about six hundred and seventy horse-power, 
and this heated the charge in the crucible to about 
6,000 degrees Centigrade. 
This tremendous heat soon melted the iron and 
brought it to a ‘highly fluid state with the carbon 
melted in it. To put the carbon under pressure — 
and make it crystallize into diamonds, the molten 
mass was suddenly dropped into cold water. As 
the iron solidified on the outside first, that on the 
‘inside expanded-against it and exerted a mighty 
pressure on the car bon,when it became i in very 
truth real diamonds. 
The next thing to do was to get tKe “diamonds 
- out of the iron, and this was done by dissolving 
the latter away with hydrochloric acid. This left 
rough carbon coating around the diamonds 
- -which was removed with aqua regia, that is a 
mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acid. The dia- 
“monds thus made were barely large enough to be 
h with the naked eye, but they were real 
ugh they were not commercially valuable 
er as an abrasive or for ornaments. Making 
ds of any considerable size is as yet an 
anding achievement of the chemist, for it 
only requires an exceedingly high tempera- 
liquefy the carbon but a tremendous pres- 
           
      
-P-A-G-E-279
246 WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY 
sure to make it crystallize. It is, however, only 
a question of time until diamonds as pure and as 
large as those found in the Kimberley mines will 
be made synthetically and then everybody can 
wear them if they want to. 
Making Synthetic Emeralds.—Besides dia- 
monds the only other really precious stones are 
the emerald, ruby and sapphire, and all of these 
are noted for their hardness, beauty of color and 
brilliancy. Now there is a mineral called beryl 
and the emerald is a very pure variety of it. 
This gem has a beautiful green color and it was 
worn by the ancients, who could afford them, not 
only as an ornament but because they were be- 
lieved to prevent and cure diseases. It is a mat- 
ter of history that Emperor Nero wore an eye- 
_ glass made of an emerald so that he might see 
distant objects the better. 
Since perfect emeralds are seldom made by 
Nature those without a flaw are just as costly as 
diamonds of the same quality, hence making them 
synthetically appeals to the chemist as much as 
making diamonds. From a technical point the 
process seems easier of solution, for high temper- 
atures are not needed, but those that have been 
made in the laboratory are so small that they 
have no value. To begin with, the emerald is a 
silicate, that is it is formed of aluminum. silicate, 
which in turn is compound made-up of alwmi-

- PIAMONDS AND OTHER GEMS 247 
sewm, silicon and glucinum. Aluminum, as you 
know, is a metal, and silicon. and glucinum are 
elements of the order of carbon and boron, while 
the brilliant green color of the gem is due to the 
chromium 3 in it. 
».As the emerald is composed of very different 
‘substances from that of the diamond, a process 
different from that used in making the latter was 
meéeded to produce it. Two chemists, Haute- 
Feuille and Perry, got up’a process in 1890 for 
imaking synthetic emeralds which consisted first 
‘of. preparing a solution of lithium dimolybdate. 
Lithium is a very light silver-white metal, like so- 
_ dium and potassium, while dimolybdate is a yel- 
‘Jewish powder made by heating molybdenite, 
which is a sulphide of the metal molybdenum. 
st: Next they dissolved aluminum silicate and 
a glucinum silicate, in the exact amounts in which 
__¥hese compounds are found in natural emeralds,

xlromium, to give the gems their green color.

@entigrade and kept at this temperature continu- 
sly for two weeks, when beautiful little emer-

aquamarines in the same way, for both kinds of 
stones are formed of the same basic silicates and 
the only difference between them is that the for- 
mer are green in color, while the latter have a 
blue, or bluish-green, color. 
Making Rubies and Sapphires in the Oxy- 
Hydrogen Furnace——We now come to a class of 
gems that are just as costly and. equally as highly 
prized as diamonds and emeralds, and these are 
rubies and sapphires. - And the interesting part 
of it is that the last-named gems are made on a 
commercial scale and are just as large, perfect 
and beautiful as the finest of the natural stones. 
In the preceding chapter we discussed car- 
borundum, how it is made in the electric fur- 
nace and used instead of emery for grinding and 
polishing metals. Emery is a natural product 
and is a granular variety of a mineral called co- 
rundum, which, in turn, is formed of aluminum 
oxide, the hardest substance known next to the 
diamond. Now it happens that aluminum oxide 
is also the chief substance of which the ruby and 
sapphire are composed. Emery is crystallized 
aluminum oxide with impurities in it, while the 
ruby and sapphire are crystallized aluminum ox- 
ide which, except for the trace of coloring matter 
_ in them, are absolutely pure. It does not take 
“nearly as great a heat to crystallize aluminum 
oxide as it does to crystallize carbon, so instead of

-an electric furnace, which is employed in making 
diamonds, an, oxy-hydrogen furnace is used for 
making rubies and sapphires. 
How an Oxy-Hydrogen Blowpipe is Made.— 
‘An oxy-hydrogen blowpipe is an apparatus so 
eonstructed that a flame of hydrogen burns in a 
blast of oxygen. This type of blowpipe was in- 
vented by Dr. Robert Hare, of Philadelphia, 
who made and used the first one in 1801, and 
with it he melted strontium, a metal that-is very 
much like calcium, and vaporized platinum, 
which has quite a high melting point. When hy- 
drogen and oxygen are mixed (not combined) 
. they are very explosive, and so, in order to burn 
hydrogen in oxygen the gases must not be al- 
lowed to mix until they reach the jet where the 
flame takes place. 
_.-To do this a special jet is needed. In its sim- 
_  plest form the jet consists of a small tube through 
Which the hydrogen flows under pressure and a 
tube. surrounding it through which oxygen is 
forced under pressure. These gases are com- 
essed in separate steel cylinders and they are 
nnected to their respective hydrogen and oxy- 
‘gen inlets of the jet with rubber tubing. ‘The 
drogen is allowed to flow through the jet first 
it-is lighted and then the oxygen is turned

Fahrenheit. At this temperature a watch-spring 
will burn and scintillate like fireworks, and plati- 
num, one of the most difficult metals to melt, is 
easily brought to the liquid state. 
Now when an oxy-hydrogen flame is directed 
upon some substance which will neither burn 
nor melt, the spot where the flame strikes will be 
so intensely heated that it will give forth a daz- 
zling white light. Such a substance is quicklime, 
that is calcium owide, and as this is used for the 
purpose the light is called the lime light, or 
calcium light. This light was first produced — 
by Drummond and in the early days it was com- 
monly spoken of as the Drummond light. Be- 
fore the electric arc light came into general use 
a lime light set in front of a reflector was used as 
a spot-light for stage illumination, and in stere- 
opticons for projecting pictures on a screen. 
Another useful apparatus for many purposes 
is the oxy-acetylene blowpipe. You will recall 
in the preceding chapter on Electric Furnace 
Products that-fvhen calcium oxide is heated with 
carbon in afi electric furnace calcium carbide is 
formed, and, further, you will remember that in 
the chapter on Good and Bad Gases we explained 
that when water came in contact with calcium 
carbide the reaction set free acetylene gas. Now

in the blowpipe and is burned in a jet of oxygen

w we will get back to the making of rubies 
sapphires. It seems strange that although 
um oxide was melted with the oxy-hydro- 
blowpipe early in the nineteenth century, it 
ynearly a hundred years later before anyone 
jaght it worth while to examine the inside of 
mass that was so formed. When this was 
done it was found that a true crystal was 
sult and an analysis of it showed that it 
sed the same properties as the ruby and 
ire. Then several more years elapsed be- 
M. Verneuil, of France, invented the oxy- 
gen. furnace in which the aluminum oxide 
hrough the flame of the blowpipe in a con- 
$ Stream, 
Verneuil ‘furnace consists of a base on

ment so that the latter can be raised or

about the size of a candle and which has a taper- 
ing top like the point of a lead pencil. Over the 
stand and rod sets the furnace chamber and this 
is supported by an upright rod fixed to the base. 
In the top of this rests the jet of the hlowpipe, 
while the other end supports a funnel-shaped box 
in which there is a sieve that holds the aluminum 
oxide. 
The lower end of the box is connected to a thin 
metal tube which has an inlet in its upper end 
for admitting the hydrogen, and the jet is at its 
lower end. Surrounding the hydrogen tube, 
through which the aluminum oxide falls, is a sec- 
ond tube that has an inlet at the top for admit- 
ting the oxygen and an outlet at the bottom so 
that the hydrogen flame can burn in it. When 
the blowpipe is lighted, the point of the flame 
strikes directly on the end of the earthenware 
rod. Finally a tapping device, made like an elec- 
tric bell with the gong removed, is secured to the 
top of the support rod and this is connected with 
and operated by a battery. With this furnace 
rubies and sapphires have been satisfactorily pro- 
duced. 
How Synthetic Rubies and Sapphires Are 
Made.—As both rubies and sapphires are formed 
of aluminum oxide the method of making them is 
exactly the same. The finest rubies are those 
that have a pigeon-blood color and when these
-P-A-G-E-286

are pure and weigh two carats, or more, they are 
often worth ten times as much as a white dia- 
-mond of the same quality. To make a ruby of a 
_ pigeon-blood color you put into the sieve in the 
“ box at the top of the furnace some aluminum ow- 
ide with a trace of chromiwm oxide, which is a 
green powder and yet which, strange/to relate, 
gives the gem its red color. 
;» This done, light the oxy-hydrogen {jet and set 
-the electric tapper into operation when a fine 
stream of the charge will begin to fall through 
the inner tube; on reaching the jet it passes 
‘through it and the flame, when it melts and drops

builds up a little pear-shaped mass, or boulé

beautiful as any ruby that was ever

characteristic blue color. Gems of

-P-A-G-E-287
254 WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY 
Not the least remarkable thing about making 
these gems in the oxy-hydrogen furnace is that it 
takes only half an hour to make a boulé weighing 
thirty carats, and from this two stones can be cut _ 
each of which weighs six carats. Further, one 
operator can take care of ten, or more, furnaces, 
so both the labor as well as the raw material is 
cheap. You can get a fair idea of the extent of 
the synthetic gem industry when I tell you that 
six million carats of sapphires and ten million 
carats of rubies are produced every year. But 
these gems, however pure and beautiful, do not 
fetch the fancy prices that oriental stones do; in- 
stead, the prices range anywhere from a quarter 
to five dollars a carat, which brings them within 
reach of everybody.

256 WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY, 
How Radiwm Was Discovered—Now let us 
find out just what this wonderful element is and 
how it was discovered. It is almost thirty 
years since Professor Roentgen, of Germany, 
discovered the X-rays—those curious rays which 
pass through wood, leather and flesh but are 
stopped by metals, bone and other dense sub- 
stances. ‘These rays affect a photographic plate 
like light waves for they are waves exactly like 
light but so short they cannot be seen by the eye. 
Almost as soon as the X-rays were,discovered 
scientists everywhere began _ to-tSt ~ phosphores- 
cent bodies, rare earths and minerals in order to 
find out if any of these substances would give out 
waves of a like nature. About a year after the 
X-rays were discovered, Professor Becquerel, of 
Paris, found that certain salts of uranium, a 
metal which occurs in nature chiefly in the min- 
eral known as pitchblend, or uwraninite, emitted, 
that is gave out, waves which passed through 
paper and some other opaque substances, were 
stopped by metals and would affect a photo- 
graphic plate. These radiations were called 
Becquerel rays. a 
Two years later, that is in 1898, Professor 
Schmidt and Madame Curie, of Paris, found that 
the salts of thorium, an element that occurs prin- 
cipally in the mineral thorite, emitted rays ex- 
actly like those of uranium, and then M. and
-P-A-G-E-290
RADIUM 257 
‘Mime. Curie made an investigation of a large 
number of the metals, rare earths, minerals, ele- 
ments and compounds, when they discovered that 
pitchblend, in which uranium is found, gave off 
rays which are far more active, that is powerful, 
‘than uranium alone. The Curies were con- 
-vinced that there was some other element in 
pitchblend which produced these very active rays 
and they began a long series of chemical opera- 
. tions that finally resulted in the separation from 
it-of two radio-active elements; the first of these, 
which is a thousand times more active than ura- 
‘nium, the} named radium, and the second, which 
was less active, they called polonium, after Po- 
Jand where Mme. Curie was born. Then, in 
_.1899, M. Debierne discovered another radio-ac- 
tive element in pitchblend and this he named ac- 
How. Radiwm is Extracted—But radium 
imed the greatest attention for it was far more 
“getive than either polonium or actinium. As 
4here-is only about one-sixth of an ounce of ra- 
4 salts in a ton of pitchblend it is no small 
r.to extract it. To do this, the uranium 
is.in the pitchblend is separated from it first 
the pitchblend is then successively treated 
-hot caustic soda, hydrochloric acid and hot 
n, carbonate, that is sal soda. The solid 
which now remains contains radium. car-

donate mixed with barium carbonate and there is 
also some lead, calcium, polonium and actinium 
init. ‘These latter elements are now removed by 
further chemical operations, when radium chlo- 
ride and barium chloride alone remain. As the 
barium chloride dissolves more easily than the 
radium it is crystallized out, when only radium 
chloride remains. 
But radium chloride is a salt of radium and it 
was not until several years later that Mme. Curie 
was able to separate the radium from its chlo- 
ride. The way she did this was by using the 
electrolysis process; the cathode was formed of 
mercury and the anode of platinum-iridium, 
while the solution was made of radium chloride. 
When the current was made to pass through the 
solution it was electrolyzed and the pure metallic 
radium was deposited on the cathode when it 
formed an amalgam with the mercury. The 
cathode was then heated in an iron crucible in an 
electric furnace, with a current of pure hydrogen 
flowing over it. When the heat had driven off 
all the mercury there remained in the crucible a 
minute bit of brilliant white metal which was 
pure radium. 
Some Properties of Radiwm. Radium, that is 
the pure metal, has the color and lustre of silver 
and while it does fot tarnish when it is not ex- 
posed to air, the moment the air touches it the
-P-A-G-E-292
RADIUM _ > 259 
bright metallic lustre disappears. When a bit of 
‘yadium is thrown into water it rapidly decom- 
poses it. Not only do the rays of radium pass 
through certain opaque substances and act on 
photographic plates, but they give off light and 
heat continuously. It was Mme. Curie and M. 
‘Laborde who discovered that radium is always 
just 4 little warmer than the temperature of 
the air around it, which means that radium is 
eonstantly giving out heat. This was learned 
when these chemists had obtained their first sam- 
pie of pure radium; a particle of it dropped on a 
sheet of paper and it not only blackened it but it 
earbonized it as well. 
+ Radium is seldom: used in its pure state but 
generally as a salt and this is usually sealed in a © 
little glass tube. In this condition it looks just 
‘Hike so much common salt, but if you take it into 
‘the dark you will see that it is luminous like phos- 
phorus. Another of its remarkable properties is 
shat of making other compounds luminous when 
to-oris mixed-with them. Thus if 
7 n.is held close to.a.diamond the latter

ought near zinc sulphide this compound will

260 WONDERS OF. CHEMISTRY, 
little flashes, and the closer the radium is held to 
the zine sulphide the brighter the flashes become. 
This curious action was discovered by Sir Wil- 
liam Crookes, who constructed a little instrument 
called the spinthariscope for showing the flashes 
to the best advantage. 
pr Uses of Luminous Material—It takes only 
the smallest imaginable particle of radium to 
make a considerable quantity of zine sulphide 
luminous when they are mixed together. ‘This 
is the substance which is now so largely used 
for making the faces of watches luminous, and its 
use is being widely extended by painting danger 
points of machinery, gasoline gauges and other 
parts of automobiles, electric switches, _ fire 
alarms, safe combinations and other objects with 
the radium material. 
» How to Tell Radio-Active Substances.—An- 
other strange property of radium is that its rays 
make air a good conductor of static electricity, 
and so if it is brought close to an electrified body 
the latter will immediately lose its charge. Now 
there is a simple little instrument called the gold 
leaf electroscope, which consists of a couple of 
strips of gold leaf, about an inch Jong, one of the 
ends of each one being attached to one end of a 
brass rod. The free end of the rod is slipped 
through a piece of hard rubber, the end of the 
rod with the gold leaves on it is placed into a
-P-A-G-E-294
RADIUM 961 
wide-necked glass bottle, and the rubber is set 
into the neck like a cork. 
- When the gold leaves of the electroscope are 
charged with electricity by means of.a static ma- 
chine, the leaves, since they are both charged to 
the same sign, will diverge, that is fly apart, at 
their free ends and they will remain so until the 
electricity that is on them leaks away through the 
rod into the air. If the air is perfectly-dry they 
-will remain charged for a long time, but if the air 
“is moist the charge will soon pass into it, for dry 
air is a non-conductor and moist air is a con- 
ductor of electricity. 
When, however, a bit of radium, or radium 
salts, or any other compound that is radio-active, 
is held closely to the brass rod that projects into 
the air of a charged electroscope, the air is in- 
-stantly ionized, that is made conducting, the 
~ leaves of the electroscope are quickly discharged 
“and collapse. The electroscope, then, provides 
San easy way to tell whether or not a substance is 
idio-active and the extent of its activity. 
‘Action of Radiwm on the‘'Huwman Body.— 
ery shortly after the discovery of radium it was 
found that if a bit of it was placed close to any 
of the human body it would burn it in very 
» the same way as the X-rays. Further ex- 
nts with larger quantities of it showed that .

was next.to impossible to heal them. On the 
other hand, when properly applied it has a de- 
cided healing effect on cancers and other malig- 
nant growths, and to-day radium is best known 
for its curative properties and nearly every hos- 
pital has its own little tube of radium salts. 
Kinds of Radium Rays.—The action of ra- 
dium salts on a photographic plate, when they 
generate heat, produce phosphorescence, ionize 
the air, and cause sores and heal them, is due to 
the rays that are given off by them. Now it has 
been found that the rays are made up of three 
different kinds and these are known as the 
alpha rays, beta rays, and gamma rays. 
These different rays were separated by Profes- 
sor Rutherford, who inserted a bit of radium 
‘ chloride, or other radium salt, in the hollow 
of a cup-shaped piece of lead which rested on 
a level surface and then placed a magnet at right 
angles to it. The magnet bent the alpha-rays 
out of the straight path, and bent the beta-rays 
over like the alpha-rays, only more so and in the 
opposite direction, while the gamma-rays shot up 
and out from it in a straight line. 
Alpha-rays are made up of atoms of helium 
gas and each of them carry a charge of positive 
electricity. These atoms travel at a rate of 
about twenty thousand miles per second, or a lit- 
tle more than one-tenth as fast as light. The
-P-A-G-E-296
RADIUM 268 
heat generated by radium is caused by the col- 
lisions of the atoms of the «rays with them- 
selves and when they strike a substance like zine 
sulphide they make it luminous. — Beta-rays 
are, in turn, very small particles of matter that 
always carry a charge of negative electricity; 
these rays are turned so far out of their natural 
course that they will strike against and affect a 
photographic plate that is placed under the lead 
eup which contains the radium. They have a 
speed of’ about one hundred thousand miles a 
second, or a little more than half of that of 
light. he 
The magnet has no effect on the gamma-waves 
and in this respect they are very much like X-rays 
‘but their power to pass through substances is 
anuch greater than the latter. These rays are 
believed to be due to the action of beta-rays - 
© that are set up inside of it and which strike the 
salt of which it forms a part. In using radium

pt is made to separate the three different

What Happens to Radium.—Before the dis- 
ery of radium we were taught that all of the 
ents had existed ever since the beginning of 
iverse, that they could not be changed in 
y, and that they would continue to exist

to the end of time. Now radium is an element 
but it was not always radium and it is slowly but 
surely changing into other elements. So we are 
back to the belief of the old alchemists that one 
element may be changed into an entirely dif- 
ferent one, and so the hope has been revived that — 
the baser metals, or their equivalents, may be 
transmuted into gold. 
Not only is it known that the ancestor of 
radium is uranium, and that radium is slowly 
changing into other elements the end-product of 
which is lead, but that the metal potassium is 
_radio-active to a slight extent; this shows, ac- 
cording to Professor Martin, of London, that all 
the other elements are changing into still other 
elements, though the rate of change is so slow 
that no way has yet been found actually to prove 
it. Fortunately radium changes into other ele- 
ments fast enough so that it is possible to show 
just what is going on. 
As just-stated, radium was not always radium 
but in the beginning was uranium, which is 
the heaviest of all known elements. Uranium 
changed first into uranium Xi, this into 
uranium: X 2, this into uranium 2, this into ionium, 
and it is this element that changes into radium. 
Next when radium splits up it changes into 
“heliwm, and niton; helium, as explained before, 
_is made up of alpha-rays; and niton is the

emanation of radium after the other: part of 
the latter has changed into helium. Niton, then, 
changes into radium A, this into radium B, this 
into radium C, this into radium D,. this into 
radium E, this into radium F', which resembles 
the: metal bismuth, this into polonium, and 
“finally polonium changes into lead. The curi- 
ous thing about the lead which is evolved through 
the above list of elements is that it is exactly like 
ordinary lead in all respects except it is not quite 
soheavy. In this way then does the transmuta- 
tion of lead from uranium take place. 
“The transmutation of uranium into radium 
and this element into lead is a perfectly natural 
“pr ess; but Dr. Rutherford, of England, who 
done the major part of the recent research 
: in the field of radio-activity, has been able 
use the transmutation of various other ele- 
its. artificially; this, however, does not at all 
a.that it is now possible to transmute lead, or 
metals, into gold, that is to make gold syn-

charge is discharged through the wire into 
the-earth and the leaves fall together. Then the 
radium charges them again, they diverge, make 
contact with the tin-foil, discharge into the earth 
and collapse. And so the cycle of operations is 
repeated and if the vacuum in the tube is perfect

THE COMING MIRACLES OF 
CHEMISTRY 
In the dim pliocene age, a million years or so 
ago, when man had just emerged from his un- 
- known ancestors, his intelligence was but a shade 
higher than that of the anthropoids* who lived 
_ atthe same time. His life then was a simple one 
for he lived in the country that is now Egypt, or, 
more likely, in the valley to the north of it and 
which is now covered with the waters of the 
Mediterranean Sea. Since the climate was salu- 
brious the year round, even as it is now, he 
needed no clothes, and the food he ate was at hand 
for the mere plucking or the killing of it. He 
was an animal, restless, energetic and curious, 
and now and thén he would get a thought in the 
back of his brain. His was the simple life for 
work had not yet been invented. 
Man the Non-chemist.—As man passed on and 
up through the glacial age he learned how to 
2 Animals that are something like a man in form and. other 
characteristics.

make fire, eat meats, fashion-stone im- 
plements, use the skins of animals to cover him, 
to draw pictures and to live in caves. As he did 
not have to do real work and as there was noth- 
ing his fellow man had that he did not have— 
except perhaps his neighbor’s daughtey—he too 
lived a simple and unintelligent life.“ But times 
were changing, and following came the nimble- 
witted man, or homo-sapiens as he is called, and 
his ability to observe and to think was far greater 
than any of his ancestors. He it was who dis- 
covered the wheel, how to grow things for food, - 
to tan leather, to weave cloth and to make 
pottery. But the crowning discovery of his time 
was a heavy, reddish substance which fire would 
not burn, water would nat change, and which he 
could hammer into various shapes without break- 
ing. It was as wonderful \o him as radium is to 
us, but we now consider % very commonplace 
for it was the metal co Primitive man 
set out to find more of it and having found it he 
wrought it into ornaments and implements. A 
new age was upon the human race and they _ 
progressed, for it was the age of copper, a litile 
‘higher intelligence and of work. 
Man the Alchemist.—Then one by one other 
“metals were found, including gold and lead 
and mercury, and things that were non-metals, as 
-salt and sulphur. Imagine the interest that mer-    
-P-A-G-E-305

‘eury, the liquid metal, must have caused when it 
' was discovered, and sulphur, which burns with a 
ghastly light, gives off stifling fumes, which 
when melted changes into a molasses-like liquid 
_ and when cooled in water stretches like rubber! 
By the time the human race had reached this 
advanced stage of progress there were matiy 
things a few of its members had and which all of 
them wanted, but because gold was the scarcest 
and the hardest to get it was the chief object of 
theif desire. . 
tf The observers, who lived only a few hundred 
/years ago, had examined four other things in 
/ nature, namely, carth, air, fire and water, and 
these they called the elements’ and they thought 
they could make any substance they wanted to 
by merely combining' them; thus they believed 
that sulphur was made by fire acting on air; mer- 
eury by air acting on water, and salt by water 
acting on earth. Their big idea, though, was that 
by compounding the above so-called elements 
they could obtain the essence, and having once 
got that they needed only to add it to lead to 
\ Change the latter into gold. 
Very quickly indeed did this alluring belief 
find favor, and soon many men were working in 
secret laboratories melting metals, boiling solu- 
10 called by the alchemists because they were believed to be 
_ the fundamentals of which everything else was made.

tions, mixing solids and performing all sorts of 
experiments without knowing what they were do- 
ing but with the full knowledge of what they 
wanted to get, and this was the coveted es- 
sence. Each alchemist had his own formula for 
transmuting lead into gold and one of these 
was to calcine it, that is to burn it, and by 
adding some of the wonderful essence to it the 
baser metal would change into the finer one at 
‘once. : 
That this was possible was to their simple 
minds an assured fact, for when a large mass of 
lead was fired in a furnace a bead of silver was 
“always found in the charred remains. We know 
    
  now that all native lead, that is pure lead as it is 
found in nature, has a small amount of silver 
mixed with it and that this was separated out by 
the burning process. Had they known this too, 
it would have only confirmed the idea already 
fixed in their minds that the lead was growing 
into silver. It is clear that man had mentally 
improved, though not greatly, over his prehis- 
toric ancestors but the age in which he lived had 
taken on a much more complex aspect. _ 
«As time moved on apace, the latter-day al- 
chemists did some very good work for they were 
thinking about the substances they were working 
: with as well as of transmuting lead into gold, 
and thought is the only essence that has got, or

‘will ever get, the human race anywhere. One of 
these thinking alchemists was Von eim, 
'a, Swiss doctor who was born in the memorable 
’ year of 1492, and who called himself Paracelsus. 
He discovered the way to make laudanum and 
so benefited medicine; and he was also the first 
to make hydrogen which was a real experiment 
in chemistry. , , 
Man the Chemist.—F rom this first step more 
than two hundred years passed before the next 
‘one was taken, and this was when Robert Boyle, 
of England, studied the air and explained how 
and why things burned in it. It was Boyle, too, 
who showed how foolish the alchemists’ idea was 
of the four elements and explained just what an 
element consisted of, namely a substance that 
cannot be decomposed into any simpler su 
stance. After Boyle, came Jean Ray, of Fran 
who proved that air was not a chemical com- 
‘pound. but a mechanical mixture of two gases, 
though he did not know what these gases were. 
Later on Joseph Priestley, of England, mad 
one of the gases of the air which was oxy; 
- and Lavoisier, the French chemist, found that 
the other gas was nitrogen. It was Lavoisier 
who classified the acids, bases and salts, and his 
system is still in use. These were the first real 
chemists. :

chemical apparatus for generating a current of 
‘electricity, and out of which grew the electric 
battery, was made by Volta, an Italian scientist, 
in 1798; Sir Humphry Davy, of London, de- 
composed water by means of it in 1800, and 
shortly after he obtained the new metals, sodium 
and potassium, by the same means. Then in 
1808 John Dalton, of England, got up the 
atomic theory which states that an atom is an . 
exceedingly minute particle of matter, that each 
element is formed of atoms having exactly the 
“same weight, and that an atom cannot be divided 
by any known means. It is easy to get the idea 
of Dalton’s atom for all you have to do is to 
think of it as a little sugar-coated pill. 
Faraday’s researches on the action of electric 
currents and magnetism in.3801 led to the in- 
vention of the induction coor spark coil, which 
Ruhmkorff brought to a high state of perfection 
“in 1846 and, finally, about 1850, Geissler pro- 
duced a new air pump and pumped out. glass 
tubes which he had previously filled with gases of 
various kinds, A pair of wires were sealed in the 
ends of the tubes and these he connected with 
the induction coil. When the high tension cur- 
rent passed through these Geissler tubes, as 
they came to be called, they gave forth a soft 
glowing light of various colors according to the 
-gas they contained.
-P-A-G-E-309
974 WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY, 
The subject of the electric discharge in gases 
_ “was thoroughly investigated by Sir. William 
Crookes in 1879, With an air pump of special 
construction he was able to exhaust glass tubes 
to a much higher degree than had ever been 
obtained. before, so that the number of molecules 
of gas remaining in the tubes were very few and 
far between. When these were acted upon by 
the high tension current, new phenomena were 
produced and Crookes announced he had discov- 
ered a fourth state of matter, that it was neither 
solid, liquid nor gaseous, and this he called radi- 
ant matter. And he was right, for the particles 
which are thrown off from the cathode of a high 
vacuum tube, or Crookes tube as it is called, 
are. cathode rays, that is rays made up of elec- 
_ ‘trons, which are’ in turn particles of negative 
electricity each of which is much smaller than an 
atom. ‘ 
These cathode-rays, or streams of electrons;~ 
move with a velocity very much higher than a 
projectile fired from a gun and tend to travel in 
straight lines. In experimenting with a tube, in 
one end of which he had. placed a thin sheet of 
aluminium, Lenard found, in 1894, that the 
electrons of the cathode rays passed through it, 
and then, Roentgen, the next year, discovered the 
X-rays. , / 
opr the beginning of the same year, 1895, an

COMING MIRACLES 275 
important discovery was made by Lord Rayleigh 
and Sir William Ramsay; this was a new gas 
that is in the air, and to it they gave the name of 
- argon; then a few months later Ramsay discov- 
ered another new gas which was very like argon 
but which he obtained by boiling a mineral called 
elévite with dilute sulphuric acid; this gas he 
called heliwm, because the same gas had been dis- 
covered by Janssen and Lockyer in the sun more 
than a quarter of a century before; they named” 
the gas helium which is the Greek word for sun, 
and these two gases were shown to be the same 
by means of the spectroscope. Now clévite 
contains uranium and the fact that it gives 
off helium connects it up with radio-activ- 
ity. Finally, Ramsay discovered two more 
new gases which he called krypton and «xenon, 
and the way he did this was to liquefy a large 
amount of argon and let it evaporate, when the 
two new gases remained behind because they 
were the heavier. 
In the preceding chapter we discussed other - 
things such as the discovery of the Beequerel 
rays and of radium, as well as the work of 
Becquerel, Curie, Rutherford and other great 
chemists. And you have already seen that in- 
stead of the atom being indivisible it is really 
made up of particles of positive electricity 
around which surge electrons, or particles of

~ negative charges of electricity, just as the planets 
revolve around the sun. You have also seen that 
_ these electrons fly off from thé atom and some of 
them, when they are emitted from radium as 
a-rays, become helium.’ But the most wonder- 
ful thing of all is the transmutation of uranium 
into radium and ‘radium into lead. , 
Now hydrogen is the lightest element known, 
having an atomic weight of 1, while uranium 
is the heaviest. element that has been discovered 
and has an atomic weight of 288;~this changes 
into radiuni whose atomic weight is 226, and this 
changes into niton, or radium emanation, whose 
atomic weight is 224; niton further changes into 
bismuth whose atomic weight is 208 and, finally, 
this changes-into lead whose atomic weight is 
207. This is as far as the natural transmutation 
goes, but if a further change could be made, the 
lead would ghange into thallium whose atomic 
weight is 204, this finally into mercury whose 
atomic weight is 200 and this into gold whose 
atomic weight is 197. ‘The following table places 
the atomic weights of these elements more clearly 
before your eye, and you can easily see at a glance 
the general stages of uranium as it passes into 
lead and, also, that but three more trans- 
mutations are needed to change the lead. into 
gold.

That the transmutation of the elements can be 
accomplished by the chemist as well as by nature 
has recently been proved by Rutherford who 
bombarded nitrogen gas with the a-rays of 
radium, which are atoms of helium. When the 
helium atoms strike the nitrogen atoms some- 
_ thing happens that is very much like two loco- 
motives running toward each other at high speed 
on a single track and which meet head-on; that 
_ is to say, the nitrogen atom explodes and the 
Pieces form new atoms which are atoms of hy- 
drogen and helium. . 
Not only has Rutherford broken up the nitro- 
gen atom but he has done the same thing with the 
‘atoms of oxygen, chlorine, sodium, aluminum 
and carbon, and these, too, have yielded hydro- 
gen and helium. Here, then, is ‘the transmuta- 
tion of elements controlled by man just as cer- 
tainly as when nature changes radium into lead 
but it is done on even a more minute scale and

"so does not at all show how the transmutation of 
metals on a large scale can be affected; but 
neither did Faraday’s experiment of passing a 
wire through a magnetic field, and which set upa 
feeble electric current in it, show how high ten- 
sion currents of thousands of horse-power, such 
as we use to-day, could be generated. But it 
pointed out that a current could be set up, just as 
Rutherford’s experiments point out that_ the 
transmutation of the elements is possible. All 
we need to grow the oak is apcacorn and some 
soil. 
As these last pages are written, the newspapers 
are carrying accounts of synthetic gold being 
made in Germany, but this is certainly not true 
for it is far, too far, an advance in the state of 
the art in much too short a time. Synthetic gold . 
is not a product of the present but it will be of 
the future.. And anyway there are far more im- 
portant things to be done in the realm of chem- 
istry than making gold and diamonds, and chief 
among these is the making of synthetic food and 
the production of cheap and unlimited power. 
The energy stored up in the nucleus, 6r core, 
of an atom of whatever kind has been believed by 
scientists for many years to be very great, and it 
is now known that the atoms of helium which are 
projected from radium into space set free an

of times greater than that of a like amount of 
ENT (trinitrotoluene) and billions of times 
that which is produced by the burning of an equal 
amount of coal. Our chemists have shown us 
_. that we are living in a very intelligent age and a 
very complex one where work is the watchword 
of the world. 
Man the Superchemist—It used to delight 
Lord Kelvin to scare us moderns by showing 
mathematically how soon the coal supply of the 
world would give out; and what he said was not 
only true but it is also only a question of time un- 
til the water powers give out as well. Where the 
human race is going to get its power from when 
these natural sources are gone has occupiéd the 
thought of not a few of our greatest scientists. 
Radiant energy from the sun direct, energy from 
the tides, from the heat of the interior of the 
earth, or from the rotation of the earth itself, 
have all been given consideration. But it is more 
than probable that by the time other sources of 
energy are really needed, the superchemist will 
have unlocked the atom and so will give to man 
its tremendous power to do the world’s work. 
In 1898 Sir William Crookes startled the 
world by declaring that unless the farmers raised™ | 
far more wheat per acre than they had yet done 
the white races would either have to use other 
grains or suffer a decrease in population, which

‘means that the oriental races would then forge 
ahead of us. ‘The way to increase the yield of - 
wheat is by using ‘fertilizers, and every year 
since he made the statement, except during the 
‘World War, more wheat per acre has been raised 
so that we are, apparently, as far from the end 
of a wheat famine as we were in 1898. The 
world gets its phosphates from the United States, 
its nitrates from Chili, and its potash from Ger- 
many, and there are great deposits of all of these 
- fertilizers, but. at the present rate they are being 
used up there must finally come a time when 
they will be exhausted. And then what? 
‘While we know of no way to produce potash 
cheaply either by making it synthetically or 
otherwise, chemists have learned how to fix the

other purposes. And long before the potash and

a means for making both of them from tlie ele-

As far back as 1828, Wéhler, a German chem- 
ist, built up out of ordinary mineral substances 
a white, crystalline compound called urea which 
is naturally found in the bodies of animals. It 
was the first time in the history of chemistry that 
an organic compound, that is living matter, 
or matter which once lived, was made of in- 
organic substances, or matter which has never 
lived. As urea contains a large amount of am- 
_ monia it is now made in car-load lots. .Many 
other organic compounds have been made from 
inorganic substances since Wéhler’s time. 
In 1863 Marcellin Berthelot, of France, made 
fats and other organic compounds, that is, com- 
pounds like those of living matter. This he did 
by taking various elements found free in nature 
or in mineral compounds, and building them up 
little by little, adding an atom of carbon, of hy- 
drogen, of nitrogen or oxygen as it was needed. 
: In the first few years of this century Emil 
, Fischer, of Germany, made protein, or albu- 
_ ‘men, as it is commonly known, that peculiar com- 
pound of which the white of egg.is made, in the # 
same way that Berthelot built up his compounds, /

.© but as it is very complex he had to add atoms of 
sulphur, phosphorus and iron. It cost Fischer 
about five hundred dollars in time and money to | 
make half as much albumen as there is in an egg, 
and as long as Madam Hen and Mr. Beef can 
produce eggs and meat cheaper than the super- 
chemist they will be allowed to do so. But should 
they €ver go on a strike, or become extinct, 
butcher shops will become a thing of the dead 
past and man will buy his fats and proteins at the 
chemist shops. 
And the synthetic product will be better than 
that of flying birds and hoofed animals that 
formerly supplied man with a large part of his 
foodstuffs, for there will be no such things as 
cold storage to freeze the taste out of them, or 
diseases to poison them. When this halcyon age 
arrives, everyone will have all the diamonds and 
other gems he wants, gold will be more plentiful 
than lead is now, power will be as cheap as water, 
and life will be one long, sweet dream.j/Then 
will man have become ultra-intelligent, and he 
' will gain live the simple life of the pliocene man, | 
for work will have once more lost its meaning.

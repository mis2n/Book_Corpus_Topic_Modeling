PREFATORY NOTE 
Tv is now nearly three score years since Nathaniel F. 
Moore prepared “ An Historical Sketch of Columbia Col- 
lege,” which was published in 1846 while its author was 
President. A revision of Dr. Moore’s history, under- 
taken by Professor Van Amringe and published in 1876, 
continued the annals of the College down to the earlier 
years of the administration of President Barnard. To 
an elaborate work of reference, entitled “ American Uni- 
versities and their Sons,” published in 1898, Professor 
Van Amringe contributed a history of Columbia, from its 
foundation as King’s College to its removal to Morning- 
side Heights; and numerous historical articles have from 
time to time been published by George H. Moore, John 
MacMullen, John B. Pine, and others. It has seemed to 
the Trustees of the Columbia University Press, however, 
that a more comprehensive work was needed, and that 
such a work would most appropriately commemorate the 
one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the founding of 
the College. They have accordingly appointed a sub- 
committee to take charge of the publication of a history 
of the University, which shall record the successive 
phases of its expansion and trace the development of each 
of its component schools and colleges. For this volume 
Dean Van Amringe has revised and continued his account

which have been incorporated in the University. How 
successfully they have accomplished this object the fol-

BOOK ONE 
KINGS COLLEGE AND COLUMBIA COLLEGE 
CHAPTER I 
1702-1754 
THE FOUNDING OF KING’S COLLEGE 
On the thirty-first day of October, 1754, George I, 
King of England, created by letters patent “a Body poli- 
tick and Corporate, in deed, fact, and name,” “the Govern- 
ors of the College of the Province of New York, in the City 
of New York, in America,” and ordained that, certain desig- 
nated lands having been first conveyed and assured to the 
corporation, “ there be erected and made on the said Lands 
a College, and other Buildings and Improvements, for the 
use and convenience of the same, which shall be called 
and known by the name of K1n@’s COLLEGE, for the 
Instruction and Education of youth in the Learned Lan- 
guages, and Liberal Arts and Sciences.” 
It is difficult to determine at what period the design of 
establishing a College in New York was first seriously 
entertained. The Colony was settled under the auspices 
of a trading company, and attracted, at first and for a 
considerable time, settlers who were chiefly intent upon 
the pursuit of gain.

A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1702 “The English who, on the transfer of the province in 1674, came in were for the most part as indifferent to learning as the Dutch had been; and even sixty-seven years afterwards there were, in all the province, to be found but ten men who had received a collegiate educa- tion. The Huguenots, and the Germans of the Palatinate, who fled hither from religious persecution were men who might, like our eastern brethren, have turned their thoughts to the foundation of a seat of learning, but their compara- tively small number, and the difference of language, made them, for a long time, strangers, as it were, in the land which afforded them a refuge. This diversity of lan- guage — for Dutch, English, French, and German were all spoken in the province —and a corresponding difference of religion, either as to doctrine or external forms, were no doubt among the causes which so long retarded the establishment of a College in New York. For a College was, by our ancestors, rightly regarded as a religious, no less than a scientific and literary, institution; and they may have found it hard to combine the heterogeneous elements of their social system in any harmonious action on a subject of such near concernment.” 1 
The earliest suggestion of, and manifestation of an intent 
to found, a College appear to be contained in a letter 
written, in 1702, to the Secretary of the Society for the 
Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, by Lewis 
Morris, Governor of the Province of New Jersey, and in 
the minutes of the Vestry of Trinity Church. Governor 
Morris wrote: “The Queen has a Farm of about 32 
Acres of Land, wch Rents for £36 p- Ann: Tho the 
Church Wardens & Vestry have petitioned for it & my 
Ld four months since gave ym a promise of it the pro- 
ceeding has been so slow that they begin to fear the Success 
wont answer to the expectation. I believe her Maty. would 
readily grant it to the Society for the asking. N. York is 
the Center of English America & a Proper Place for a 
Colledge,— & that Farm in a little time will be of consid- 
erable Value, & it’s pity such a thing should be lost for 
1 President Moore’s Historical Sketch. 
 
-P-A-G-E-21
  THE FOUNDING OF KING’S COLLEGE 3 
want of asking, wch at another time wont be so Easily 1746 
obtained.” 
The petition of the Church Wardens and Vestrymen of 
Trinity Church referred to was successful, and, in 1702 or 
1703, the farm was deeded or leased to the church. In 
the minutes of the Vestry for February 19, 1703, appears 
the following entry: “It being moved which way the 
King’s Farm which is now vested in Trinity Church 
should be let to farm. It was unanimously agreed that 
the Rector & Church Wardens should wait upon my Lord 
Cornbury, the Govr., to know what part thereof his Lordp 
did design towards the Colledge which his Lordp designs 
to have built & thereupon to publish Placards for the 
letting thereof at the public outcry to the highest bidder. “i 
The records unfortunately fail to disclose Lord Cornbury’s 
intention. 
Early in 1729 Bishop Berkeley, then Dean of Derry, 
arrived in this country on his way from England to Ber- 
muda to establish a College. He landed at Newport, 
Rhode Island, and there took up a temporary residence. 
Not long after his arrival he conceived that he had made 
a mistake in fixing upon Bermuda as the place for his 
College. “He then wrote to his friends in England, 
requesting them to get the patent altered for some place 
on the American continent, which would, probably, have 
been New York; and to obtain the payment of the sum 
that had been granted him.” ‘ 
Nothing came of this proposition and no further men- 
tion is made of the subject until 1746, when an Act was 
passed by the General Assembly of New York “for rais- 
ing the sum of £2250 bya Public Lottery for this Colony,, 
& for the advancement of Learning & towards the Found- 
ing of a College within the same.” The Act—premising, 
“ Inasmuch as it will greatly tend to the welfare and repu- 
tation of the Colony that a proper and ample foundation

1751 be laid for the regular education of youth, and as so good 
  and laudable a design must readily excite the inhabitants 
of this Colony to become adventurers in a lottery of which 
the profits shall be employed for the foundation of a Col- 
ledge for that purpose,” — made the necessary provisions 
for a lottery. Similar laws followed, and, in 1751, the 
several sums raised by the lotteries, amounting in all to 
£3443 18s. were, by the Legislature, vested in Trustees, 
who were authorized to receive proposals “from any of 
the Cities or Counties within this Colony which shall be 
desirous of having the said College erected within their 
said Cities, or Counties, touching the placing or fixing the 
same therein respectively.” Soon after the Trustees were 
appointed, Trinity Church proposed to deed to them “any 
reasonable quantity of the Church farm (which was not 
let out) for erecting and use of a College.” This proposal, 
which had apparently been in view by the Church from 
the time of its acquiring “ the King’s Farm,” had doubtless 
a controlling influence in the selection of New York City 
as the site of the College. 
On the 4th of July, 1753, the assembly passed a sup- 
plementary act authorizing and directing the Treasurer 
of the Colony, for the time being, to pay to the Trustees 
“out of the monies arising by the Duty of Excise, the 
annual Sum of five hundred pounds, for and during 
the Term of Seven Years, to commence from and after 
the First Day of January now next ensuing; ” this annu- 
ity to be apportioned and distributed in salaries. 
The Trustees named in the Act of 1751 were, “the eld- 
est Councellor residing in this Colony, the Speaker of the 
General Assembly, and the Judges of the Supreme Court, 
the Mayor of the City of New York, the Treasurer of this 
Colony, for the Time being, together with James Living- 
ston, Esq., Mr. Benjamin Nicoll and Mr. William Living- 
ston.” The fact that two-thirds of the Trustees appointed 
were in communion with the Church of England, and that

some of these were also vestrymen of Trinity Church, 1753 
excited strong opposition to the scheme. Mr. William 
Livingston was especially prominent as an opponent of the 
intended College. In accounts of the controversy he is 
spoken of as a Presbyterian. He himself, however, in his 
preface to essays which he published under the signature 
of The Independent Reflector, refers to the dispute between 
the friends and the foes of the College, to “the rancour 
that appear’d against the Presbyterians,” and says : — 
“Upon reading all this fiery rage, that was so plentifully 
vomited against whole congregations of christians; the 
following questions will naturally occur to the unpreju- 
diced reader: — what provocation was given? Was the 
‘Reflector’ a Presbyterian? Or if he was, had all the 
people of that persuasion deputed him, as their head and 
vicegerent? Did he defend presbyterianism to the con- 
fusion of high church? The provocation that was given, is 
hitherto amongst the arcana of nature. The ‘ Reflector’ has 
declared himself attached to no denomination; and ex- 
pressly wrote against Presbyterians. The Moravians he 
has as expressly vindicated against the aspersions of their 
enemies; by which he has spoiled above fifty sermons, that 
might otherwise have been ended as they were begun, 
with sense and moderation. And for thy farther satisfac- 
tion, courteous Reader, he declares that he neither is, nor 
ever was, attached to presbyterianism. To the trumperies 
of human, artificial, political & corporeal religions, he is 
still less addicted: He hopes himself in short to be, what 
no high-church man as such ever was, nor from the nature 
of the thing can possibly be; a christian. A party that 
wants no establishment for its support; but ever flourished 
most, when it had establishments to encounter; & ever 
decayed and languished, when by the secular arm, vindi- 
cated and aggrandized.” ? 
It is evident from the tone of the preceding extract that 
the contest for and against the College became a very 
angry one. It was largely of a religious character, and 
1 Preface to The Independent Reflector, 1753. 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
6 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1758 Mr. Livingston and his associates seemed to fear a church 
establishment. 
“ Whatever others may in their Lethargy & Supineness 
think of the Project of a Party College I am convinced, that under the Management of any particular Persuasion, 
it will necessarily prove destructive to the civil and reli- gious Rights of the People: And should any future House of Representatives become generally infected with the Maxims of the College, nothing less can be expected than an Establishment of one Denomination above all others, 
who may, perhaps, at the good Pleasure of their Superiors, be most graciously favoured with a bare Liberty of Con- science, while they faithfully continue their annual Contri- butions, their Tythes & their Peter-Pence.” 1 
Opposition was made to the procurement of a Royal 
Charter. 
“The Mutability of its Nature will incline every reason- able Man, to prefer to it that Kind of Government, which is both productive of the richest Blessings, and renders its Advantages the more precious by their superior Stability. A Charter can at best present us with a Prospect of what we are scarce sure of enjoying a Day.” “That a specious Charter will be drawn, & exhibited to public View, I sin- cerely believe: A Trick of that kind will unquestionably be made Use of, to amuse the unattentive Eye, and allure the unwary Mind into an easy Compliance. But’ it will be only Latet Anguis in Herba, & when a copious Fund is once obtained, a surrender of the Charter may make Way for a new One, which tho’ sufficiently glaring, to detect the Cheat, will only leave us Room to repent of our Cre- dulity.”’? 
Establishment by Act of Assembly was urged in pref- 
" erence. 
“By this Means that Spirit of Freedom, which I have in my former Papers, shown to be necessary to the In- crease of Learning, & its consequential Advantages, may be rendered impregnable to all attacks. While the Gov-

-P-A-G-E-27
THE FOUNDING OF KING’S COLLEGE 14 
ernment of the College is in the Hands of the People, or 1754 
their Guardians, its Design can not be perverted.” “ But 
what remarkably sets an Act of Assembly in a Light far 
superior to a Charter, is that we may thereby effectually 
counterplot every scheme that can possibly be concerted, 
for the Advancement of any particular Sect above the 
rest.” 4 
The violent controversy delayed the granting of the 
Charter, which was, however, finally passed, as before 
stated, October 81, 1754. Under date of “Monday, 
10 o’clock, November 4, 1754,” the Rev. Henry Bar- 
clay, Rector of Trinity Church, New York, wrote to 
the intended President of the College: — 
“On Thursday last the Charter passed the Governor 
and Council, and was ordered to be forthwith engrossed. 
On Friday, the Trustees appointed by Act of Assembly, 
according to order of the House, delivered in a report of 
their proceedings conformable to the Act, which report 
was signed by all but William Livingston, who objected 
to the report as not being complete, because no notice was 
taken of the proceedings with regard to the Charter, which 
the Governor and the rest of the gentlemen thought un- 
necessary. Whereupon Livingston delivered in a sepa- 
rate report in full, containing his famous Protest, etc. 
This occasioned a great ferment in the House, and issued 
for that day in a resolve that Livingston’s Report should 
be printed at large, and the affair postponed to farther 
consideration on Wednesday next. They had a majority 
of fourteen to eight, but three of our friends were absent, 
and it was with much difficulty that they were prevented 
from censuring the conduct of the Trustees and return- 
ing thanks to Livingston. We were all afraid that this 
would have retarded the Sealing of the Charter, and some 
well wishers to the thing would have consented to the 
retarding of it, had not the Governor appeared resolute 
and come to town on Saturday and fixed the Seal to it; 
and to do him justice, he has given us a ood majority 
of Churchmen, no less than eleven of the Vestry being of 
the number. There are but eight of the Dutch Church,

1754 most of them good men and true, and two Dissenters. We are, however, puzzled what to advise you as to re- signing your mission. I have been with Mr. Chambers this morning, and though it be the opinion of most of the gentlemen that you ought to resign and trust to Provi- dence for the issue of things and come away immediately, yet we would rather choose, if possible, that you should put off the resignation for a fortnight or three weeks, and come down immediately, because some are not go clear with regard to the £500 support, though others think we cannot be deprived of it. But since this con- versation with Mr. Chambers we have had some glimmer- ing light. I went from Mr. Chambers’ to Mr. Watts’ (who is unhappily confined with rheumatism), and met two Dutch members coming out of his house, who, as he told me, came to make proposals for an accommo- dation, and all they desired was a Dutch Professor of Divinity, which, if granted, they would all join us, and give the money. This I doubt not will be done unless the Governor should oppose it, who is much incensed at the Dutch for petitioning the Assembly on that head, but I make no doubt but he may be pacified... . I have not time to give you a list of the Governors, nor indeed can I recollect them all. The whole number is forty- one: seventeen ex officio and twenty-four private gentle- men, in which number there are at present but eight of the Dutch Church, the French, Lutheran, Presbyterian Ministers, and Will. Livingston,—so that we have a majority of twenty-nine to twelve, and in these twelve are included Mr. Richards, John Cruger, Leonard Lis- penard, and the Treasurer, all our good friends.” 1 
The granting of the Charter did not silence the op- position but turned it in another direction. Vigorous attempts were made to prevent a transference to the Governors named in the Charter of the money raised for the endowment of a College, and to establish by Act of the Assembly, a “New York College,” in place of, or in distinction to, a “Trinity Church College,” as, to dis- credit it, King’s College was styled. The feeling of oppo-

sition and resentment that was still active is indicated by 1755 
the following card published in the New York Gazette 
or Weekly Post Boy, No. 652, July 28, 1755:—

Advantage was taken of the arrival, in the fall of 
1755, of a new Governor-General, Sir Charles Hardy, 
to present to him an inflammatory address, in the hope 
of securing his influence against the College. “But Sir 
Charles received it with coldness and treated it as it de- 
served. On the other hand, he received the address of 
the Governors of the College, presented by the President, 
with the greatest respect and politeness. He signified 
that he was desirous of seeing their subscription paper ; 
and the next day when it was brought to him, he gener- 
ously subscribed, without any solicitations, £500 for the 
College. This was such a disappointment and mortifica- 
tion to its opposers, that from that time they were silent, 
and gave no further molestation. Not long after the 
Board of Governors, who had an equitable and just right

1755 to the whole of the money raised by lottery, for the sake 
of peace, agreed with the Assembly that it should be 
equally divided between the College and the public.” 
The Act of Assembly referred to in the foregoing sen- 
tence was the Act passed December 1, 1756. It pro- 
vided: (a) “That the one full and equal Moiety, or 
Half-part of said Monies” should be vested in the Gov- 
ernors of the College to be by them disposed of in their 
discretion, “for the Advancement of Learning in the said 
College.” (The College received £3202.) (6) “That 
the other full and equal Moiety, or Half-part of said 
Monies” should be employed — first, to provide, in or 
nigh the City of New York, “a proper Pest-House for 
the Reception of such Persons as may be infected with 
any contagious Distempers”; and second, “ for the erect- 
ing a new publick Gaol in the City of New York, in Lieu 
of that which is now in the City-Hall of the said City.” 
(¢) That £500 out of the Excise Moneys should be 
annually paid to the Trustees, as provided in the Act 
of July 4, 1753. 
Though the Charter was passed in October, 1754, its 
delivery was delayed, “the clamour was so great,” till 
May 7, 1755, at which time a majority of the Governors 
qualified by taking the oath required of them by law. At 
this, the first meeting of the Governors, was unanimously 
adopted the proposal of the Rev. Joannes Ritzema, Senior 
Minister of the Reformed Protestant Dutch Church, one 
of the Governors named in the Charter, asking for an 
additional Charter. Such additional Charter was granted 
and delivered to the Governors at a meeting held the 
3d of June following, providing : “That the Dutch shall 
here enjoy the Liberty of their Conscience in Divine 
Worship and Church Discipline, ... there may and 
shall be in the said College, a Professor of Divinity of the 
Reformed Protestant Dutch Church, for the Instruction

of such Youth as may intend to devote themselves to the 1755 
sacred Ministry in those Churches, in this Our Province 
of New York, . . . such Professor shall be from Time to 
Time, and at all Times hereafter, nominated, chosen and 
appointed by the Ministers, Elders and Deacons of the

York, for the Time being, when they shall see fit to make 
such Nomination, Choice and Appointment, . . . pro- 
vided always, such Professor, so to be chosen from Time to 
Time by them, be a Member of, and in Communion with, 
the said Reformed Protestant Dutch Church.” The 
« Ministers, Elders and Deacons” seem to have been sat- 
isfied with the grant of an authority which they never 
exercised. 
Ata meeting of the Governors of the College held on 
the 13th of May, 1755, the corporation of Trinity Church 
conveyed to them in fee “for & in consideration of the 
sum of ten shillings” “all that certain piece or parcell 
of ground situate, lying & being on the West side of the 
Broadway in the West ward of the City of New York 
fronting easterly to Church Street between Barclay street 
and Murray street four hundred and forty foot and from 
thence running westerly between and along the said Bar- 
clay street and Murray street to the North River.” It is 
more than probable that the streets named in the convey- 
ance were then merely projected and were not laid out 
till some years afterwards. 
The “express condition” of the grant was that “the 
President of the said College forever for the time being 
shall be Member of and in communion with the Church 
of England as by law established & that the Morning and 
Evening Service in the said College be the Liturgy of the 
said Church, or such a Collection of Prayers out of the 
said Liturgy with a Collect peculiar for the said College 
as shall be agreed upon & approved of by the President 
and Governors of the said College.” This condition is

12 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1754 said to have been imposed because of a fear on the part of 
the Vestry of Trinity Church that the College might other- 
wise have no religious character whatever. 
Among the papers issued during the controversy about 
the College was one entitled “A brief Vindication of the 
Proceedings of the Trustees relating to The College. 
: + + By an Impartial Hand,” and sold by H. Gaine in 
1754. The “Impartial Hand” was that of Benjamin 
Nicoll, a lawyer of distinction in New York, one of the 
Trustees named in the act of 1751, subsequently named 
in the Charter as one of the Governors of the College, a 
Vestryman of Trinity Church, and stepson of the Rev. 
Dr. Johnson, first President of King’s College. In this, 
after mentioning the appointment of Trustees in 1751 and 
the violent attacks. made upon them and the intended 
College, the writer says :— 
“Soon after, the Trustees above mentioned, took upon 
them the Burthen of their Office, the Rector, Church- 
Wardens and Vestry of Trinity Church, being willing to promote the laudable Design of establishing a College among us, made an Offer of some of their lands for that Purpose, which generous Offer, the Trustees thought worthy of Thanks ; and accordingly the Chief-Justice, in their Name, thanked them for it; the Place being es- teemed by all the Trustees, as the most convenient for the Purpose in the whole Government... . The ‘ Indepen- dent Reflector,’ it seems, collecting from this Proposal 
of the Rector, Church-Wardens and Vestry, that it was very probable, as they were churchmen, and believed something of the Christian Religion, they would endeavour that something of that should be taught Youth, in the Course of their Education at College; . . . loudly sounded in our Ears, the terrible Dangers, the Subjects of this Province were in, from the growing power of the Church, though he all along insisted, there were ten to one against it in the Government; so inconsistent was that Author.... But M. Reflector, not content with this, with the air of a Dictator, proceeded to lay down 
Rules and Instructions for the Establishing the College in

this Province ; and among others, insisted, that as there 1754 
were different Sects of Christians among us, Therefore, in 
order to give every sect an equal Interest in the College, 
no Religion should be taught in it; and no Form of 
Prayer used, but such as was appointed by the Legis- 
lature. ... .. The Members of the Vestry of © Trinity 
Church (who, as several of them assured me, at first 
thought of no such Thing) finding with what Warmth and 
unbecoming Zeal, they were attacked, and that this 
Writer was not only stiring up all the other Sects of 
Christians against them but also was endeavouring 
entirely to banish Religion from the College as much as 
in him lay: They then thought it their Duty, as Chris- 
tians, and in Justice to their Constituents, to take at least 
some care, that they did not part with the Lands they were 
intrusted with, unless for the Interest of Religion ; and 
therefore, I must say, I think wisely, came to this Resolu- 
tion, viz: That they would not part with their Lands, 
but upon the conditions since mentioned in the Charter. 
The Vestry of the Church (as one of the Trustees, whose 
Veracity I can depend upon, assures me) acquainted the 
Trustees with this Resolution. Thus I have stated the 
Fact, as to this Transaction of the Members of the Vestry 
of Trinity Church, as the same truly happened ; and are 
the only steps that I have heard, or is pretended, have 
been taken by them, in order to obtain a Charter ; and 
thus much I thought necessary to relate, that it might 
clearly appear, how far they are to blame, and whether 
there was any Reason to sound the Trumpet against the 
Church, whatever there may be against a few particular 
Members of it.” 
The stipulations alluded to were, after the Revolution, 
eliminated from the Charter, but they still remain the 
condition of the deed of gift from Trinity Church.

CHAPTER II 
1754-1763 
PRESIDENT SAMUEL JOHNSON 
Tue Act of 1751 gave no authority to the Trustees 
therein named other than to put at interest the sum 
already raised, to receive additional contributions and 
donations, and to receive proposals as to the location of 
the College. The Act of July 4, 1753, appropriated an 
annual sum of money for the payment of instructors and 
authorized the Trustees to engage suitable masters. Ac- 
cordingly, on the 22d of November, 1753, “the Trustees 
wrote to Dr. Johnson, of Stratford, a Minister of the 
Church of England, known to be well qualified for the 
Education of Youth ; and Mr. Whittelsey, of Vew Haven, 
a Presbyterian Gentleman, late a Tutor of Reputation, in 
the College there, to undertake the Business of Masters in 
the intended Seminary.” Mr. Whittelsey was unable to 
accept for want of health. 
The Rev. Dr. Samuel Johnson listened favorably to 
their proposals. He was one of the notable men of his 
time in America. He was born in Guilford, Connecticut, 
in 1696, was graduated from the College at Saybrooke, 
now Yale University, and was subsequently a tutor there 
for three years. He then settled in West Haven, which 
was then a part of New Haven, as a Congregational 
minister. In the course of his studies he was led to 
doubt the validity of his ordination as a minister. He 
finally became convinced that the true ordination was the 
Episcopal ordination, went to England, and took orders as 
a minister of the Church of England. He then returned 
14 
 
-P-A-G-E-37
PRESIDENT SAMUEL JOHNSON 15 
to this country as a missionary of the Society for the 1754 
Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, and settled 
at Stratford, Connecticut, in 1723. His position was a 
very difficult and trying one. He was at the time the 
only minister of his faith in Connecticut and was subjected 
to misrepresentation and constant attack. The dignity of 
his character, his extensive acquirements, his devotion to 
the interests of religion and learning, his equable and 
benevolent temper, his unfailing courtesy and fairness, the 
representative position to which he soon attained by his 
relations with distinguished men of the Church in Eng- 
land and their confidence in him, and his acquaintance 
with men of learning and standing at home, won the trust 
and affection of his neighbors and caused him to be 
generally looked upon with the highest respect and re- 
gard. The University of Oxford, England, recognized 
his learning and labors by conferring upon him, in 1743, 
the degree of Doctor of Divinity. His reputation for 
sound judgment and scholarship, moral worth and piety 
without bigotry, became extended. When the College at 
Philadelphia, now the University of Pennsylvania, was 
projected in 1749, he was solicited to take charge of it. 
The eminent Benjamin Franklin was especially urgent and 
visited him at Stratford to induce him to do so. “The 
Doctor [Johnson] had composed a compendium of Logic, 
including Metaphysics, and another of Ethics, for the 
better instruction of his two sons in those studies. These 
were printed together in an octavo volume in 1752, by Mr. 
Franklin, in Philadelphia, for the use of the College in that 
city then about to be erected, and of which Mr. Franklin, 
so justly celebrated throughout the learned world for his 
discoveries and improvements in electricity, was one of the 
most active promoters. On that occasion he frequently 
corresponded with Dr. Johnson, whom he esteemed one of 
the best judges of such matters in the country. He con- 
sulted him about the plan of education for the College, 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
16 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1754 and urged him to undertake the Presidency of it; which 
proposal, although it was in many respects agreeable to the 
Doctor, he finally declined.” 1 
When he was invited, in 1753, to take charge of the in- 
tended College in New York, he hesitated long about it, 
but finally came to New York, by way of trial only, in 
April, 1754. He would not, however, positively accept 
the Presidency till after the passage of the Charter and 
the consequent determination of the conditions under 
which the College should proceed. 
Preparations were, however, made for the examination 
and admission of students, and in the New York Gazette 
or Weekly Post Boy of June, 3, 1754, No. 592, appeared 
an “ Advertisement—To such parents as have now (or 
expect to have) children prepared to be educated in the 
College of New York,” that it is proposed to begin tuition 
upon the first day of July next.? 
This prospectus of the new undertaking therein set 
forth is certainly liberal in spirit, and, for the time and 
under the circumstances, remarkably so. There appears 
to be nothing in it that could be rightly interpreted to 
justify the claim that the College would be conducted in 
a narrow spirit and for the especial advantage of mem- 
bers of a particular communion. The Charter indeed 
expressly prohibited the making of any law, ordinance or 
order that should “ extend to exclude any personof any 
Religious Denomination whatever from Equal Liberty 
and advantage of Education, or from any the Degrees, 
Liberties, Priviledges, Benefits, or Immunities of the said 
College, on account of his particular Tenets in matters of 
Religion.” It furthermore was so drawn as to embrace 
in the Board of Governors, besides other ez officio Repre- 
sentatives, not only the Rector of Trinity Church in the 
city of New York, but also the senior minister of the 
1 Chandler’s Life of Johnson. 2 See Appendix A,

PRESIDENT SAMUEL JOHNSON AT. 
Reformed Protestant Dutch Church in the city of New 1754 
York, the minister of the Ancient Lutheran Church in 
the city of New York, the minister of the French Church 
in the city of New York, and the minister of the Presby- 
terian Congregation in the city of New York. It is 
perhaps due to this circumstance that Columbia, almost 
alone of all the pre-Revolutionary Colleges in the United 
States, has never had a theological Faculty connected 
with it. The Charter so framed is singularly eloquent of 
the cosmopolitan character of New York even at that 
early day. The governing body of the College has never 
lost this cosmopolitan character. 
In the Mew York Gazette or Weekly Post Boy of July 1, 
1754, No. 596, appeared the following notice : — 
“This is to acquaint whom it may concern that I shall 
attend at the Vestry Room in the School House, near the 
English Church, on Tuesdays and Thursdays every week, be- 
tween the Hours of Nine and Twelve, to examine such as offer 
themselves to be admitted into the College. 
“SaMUEL JOHNSON.” 
At the examinations here provided for, eight candidates 
were admitted, viz.: Samuel Verplanck, Rudolph Ritzema, 
Philip Van Cortlandt, Robert Bayard, Samuel Provoost, 
Thomas Marston, Henry Cruger, and Joshua Bloomer. 
In the Matricula of the College it is recorded of Robert 
Bayard that “after about 2 years he went into the army”; 
of Thomas Marston, that “after about 2 years he went to 
merchandize” ; and of Henry Cruger, that “after about 
8 years, he went to England.” It is further recorded 
that “Samuel Martin was admitted to the 2d year and 
after about 2 years he went to England to study Physic.” 
It may be of interest to note, in passing, that Henry 
Cruger, who “went to England,” became a successful mer- 
chant in Bristol, rose to distinction in political life, and, 
with Edmund Burke, was chosen, in 1774, to represent 
the city of Bristol in the English House of Commons. 
c

1754 “ Burke, Cruger, and Liberty” constituted the watch- 
words of the popular party at the time of the election. 
In Parliament, he attracted attention by his ability as an 
orator. On the occasion of his maiden speech, Flood, 
the Irish orator, asked, “Who is that? who is that? 
a young speaker— whoever he is, he speaks more elo- 
quently than any man I have yet heard in the House.” 
He boldly defended his countrymen and supported their 
cause. He lost his seat in the election of 1780, “ because 
of his attachment to the Americans during the war.” He 
was, however, subsequently returned, and remained a 
member until his removal to New York City in 1790. 
At the first senatorial election in New York after his 
return to this country, he was chosen a member of the 
Senate of the State. He died full of years and honor 
in April, 1827.1 
On the 17th of July, 1754, Dr. Johnson, who consti- 
tuted in himself the entire Faculty, began, in the Vestry 
Room of the Schoolhouse of Trinity Church, the instruc- 
tion of the first class of what was soon to be King’s 
College, and later Columbia University in the city of 
New York. 
In the course of the year, the Charter was, as before 
noted, passed. Dr. Johnson was named in it as Presi- 
dent ; and the conditions of the Charter being, upon the 
whole, satisfactory to him, he accepted the office. His 
salary from the College was but £250, and, to make 
better provision for him, the Vestry of Trinity Church 
appointed him an assistant minister with a stipend of 
£150. 
On the admission of a second class in 1755, an assistant 
to the President in instruction was provided in the person 
of his son, William, Master of Arts of Yale College, who 
became fellow or assistant tutor. Father and son to-

gether conducted all the exercises of the College, to the 1755 
evident satisfaction of the Governors. In the “New 
York Gazette” of September 1, 1755, No. 657, appeared 
the following item of news :— 
“Last Monday, the Trustees of the New York Couizce, 
visited and examined the Pupils, belonging to that Seminary, 
under the Care of the Revd. Dr. Johnson, and were mighty 
well pleased with the Proficiency they had made both in their 
Latin and Greek studies.” 
The Governors of the College, at a meeting held the 
3d of June, 1755, adopted the device prepared by Dr. 
Johnson for the seal of King’s College, which continues 
to be that of Columbia College with the necessary altera- 
tion of name. The description here given is taken from 
the minutes : — 
“Tue Device or THE CoLLEGE Seat.—The College is

In a list of the “Benefactors to King’s College” it is 
stated that “Mr. George Harison presented us with the 
Engraving of the Seal which cost 10 Guineas.” 
In the summer of 1756 the funds of the institution were 
in such a condition that the Governors thought themselves 
justified in providing for the erection of a College build- 
ing. Accordingly plans were prepared, submitted to the 
Governor-General, and, on his approval, were adopted by 
the Governors, July 18, 1756. On the 23d of August 
the cornerstone was laid. The following account of the 
ceremony appeared in the Mew York Gazette of August 
80, 1756, No. 711: — 
“Last Monday was laid, by his Excellency Sir Charles 
Hardy, our Governor, the first stone of King’s College, in this 
City. On which Occasion the Honourable James De Lancey, 
Esq., our Lieutenant-Governor, the Tutor, with the students, 
met at Mr. Willett’s, and thence proceeded to the House of 
Mr. Vandenbergh, at the Common. Whither his Excellency 
came in his Chariot, and proceeded with them about One 
o’Clock to the College Ground, near the River on the North- 
West Side of the City, where a Stone was prepared, with the 
following Inscription. 
[The Latin inscription is here given.] 
“In English thus

very Worthy Governor of this Province, August 23d, An. Dom.

“After the Stone was laid, a Health was drank to his 1756 
Majesty, and Success to his Arms, and to Sir Cuaruzs, and 
Prosperity to the College, and to the Advancement of true 
Religion, Loyalty and Learning, under his Administration; 
Upon which the Reverend Dr. Johnson, President of the 
College, made the following short congratulatory speech in 
Latin. 
[Here are given the Latin speech and a translation of it 
into English. ] 
“Which being done, the Governors and Pupils laid each his

Mr. Willett’s: where there was a very elegant Dinner, after 
which all the usual loyal Healths were drank, and Prosperity 
to the College; and the whole was conducted with the utmost 
Decency and Propriety.” 
The Latin inscription on the stone is not quite accu- 
rately quoted in the Gazette, and is here given cor- 
rectly. The original stone may be seen embedded in the 
mantel-piece of the Trustees’ Room in the Library Build- 
ing at Morningside Heights.

The “ Tutor ” referred to in the account was Mr. Leon- 
ard Cutting, of Pembroke Hall, Cambridge, England, who 
replaced Mr. William Johnson in 1756, the latter having 
gone to England to take orders in the Episcopal Church. 
In November of the following year, 1757, the small- 
pox prevailed in New York, and President Johnson, who 
had accepted his office under the express condition “ that 
he should be allowed to retire to some place of safety out 
of town when the small-pox prevailed,” retired with his 
family to Westchester, where he remained more than a

   22 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1787 year. He left about thirty pupils in the then three classes, 
and as the tutor, Mr. Cutting, was unable to do them all 
justice, the Governors, on the 8th of November, appointed 
Mr. Daniel Treadwell, “a young gentleman of a very 
excellent character, educated at Harvard College, and 
recommended by Professor Winthrop as eminently quali- 
fied for that station,” Professor of Mathematics and Natu- 
ral History. This was the first professorship established 
in the College. “Soon after this, an apparatus of good 
mathematical and philosophical instruments was purchased; 
and the Rev. Dr. Bristowe, a worthy member of the 
society, lately deceased, having by his last will bequeathed 
his library, of near one thousand five hundred volumes, 
to the society to be sent to the College of New York, of 
which Dr. Johnson is President, or to such other place or 
places as the society shall direct, the society directed those 
books to be sent and placed in this College of New York, 
in approbation of the generous donor’s design.” ! 
Mr. Treadwell had begun his duties on November 1, 
under an engagement with the Committee of the Govern- 
ors charged with the oversight of the College during Dr. 
Johnson’s absence. The agreement made with him was 
“that the said Mr. Treadwell shall instruct the two 
senior classes in Mathematicks and Natural Phylosophy, 
and the youngest class in the Latin and Greek Languages, 
and that he shall receive from this Board the annual 
stipend of one hundred pounds current money of this 
Colony.” 
The College then, for the first time in its history, grew 
too large for its accommodations. The Vestry Room 
was assigned to Professor Treadwell ; Mr. Cutting, the 
tutor, was obliged to take his classes in his own private 
lodgings, for which use of his rooms he was allowed at 
the rate of £10 per annum. At the same meeting at which 
this arrangement was made (November 8), as a mark of 
1Chandler’s Life of Johnson.

approval for his efficiency, the Governors increased Mr. 1758 
Cutting’s annual stipend from £80 to £100. 
The absence of the President was prolonged till March, 
1758. In the month of June following was held the first 
Commencement. It is stated in the Matricula that “« The 
Commencement for graduating the first Class of Candi- 
dates, should have been on the second Wednesday in 
May, but for certain Reasons it was put off to the 21st 
day of June, 1758.” The following were admitted Bach- 
elors of Arts: Samuel Verplanck, Rudolph Ritzema, 
Philip Van Cortlandt, Samuel Provoost, Joshua Bloomer, 
Joseph Reade (“he had been educated at Philadelphia 
College”), Josiah Ogden and Isaac Ogden (“ both had 
been educated in the Jersey College”). (Josiah Ogden 
had received the degree from the College of New Jersey 
in 1756, and his name is now recorded as an honorary 
graduate of King’s or Columbia College.) 
The following descriptive letter appeared in the New 
York Mercury of Monday, June 26, 1758, No. 306 :— 
“Mr. Printer, Please to insert the following in your next 
Paper. Wednesday last being the Day appointed by the Gov- 
ernors of King’s College, in this City, for the Commencement, 
I had the Pleasure of being present at the first Solemnity 
of the Kind ever celebrated here; which was, thro’ the whole, 
conducted with much Elegance and Propriety. The Order 
of the Procession from the Vestry Room, where the College is 
now held, to St. Georges Chappel, was as follows: The Presi- 
dent, with his Honour the Lieutenant Governor, who, by his 
Presence graced the Solemnity, were preceded by the Candi- 
dates for Bachelor’s and Master’s Degrees, with their Heads 
uncovered, and were followed by the Governors of the College, 
the Clergy of all Denominations in this City, and other Gentle- 
men of Distinction of this and the neighbouring Provinces. 
After short Prayers suitable to the Occasion, the Reverend 
Dr. Johnston, the President, from the Pulpit, opened the 
Solemnity, with a learned and elegant Oratio Inauguralis. 
The exercises of the Bachelors were introduced by a polite 
salutory Oration, delivered by Provoost, with such Propriety

1758 of Pronunciation, and so engaging an Air, as justly gain’d him the Admiration and Applause of all present. This was fol- lowed by a metaphysical Thesis, learnedly defended by Ritzema against Ver Planck and Cortlandt, with another held by Reed, and opposed by two Ogdens. The Bachelors Exercises were closed by a well-composed, genteel English Oration, on the Advantages of a liberal Education, delivered by Cortlandt, whose fine Address added a Beauty to the Sentiment, which gave universal Satisfaction to that numerous Assembly. After this, Mr. Treadwell, in a clear and concise Manner, demon- strated the Revolution of the Earth round the Sun, both from astronomical Observations, and the Theory of Gravity, and defended the Thesis against Mr. Cutting and Mr. Witmore, a candidate for the Degree of Master of Arts. This Dispute be- ing ended, the President descended from the Pulpit, and being seated in a chair, in a solemn Manner, conferred the Honours of the College upon those Pupils who were Candidates for a Bachelor’s Degree, and on several Gentlemen who had received Degrees in other Colleges. The Exercises were concluded with a Valedictory Oration [in Latin] by Mr. Cutting, universally esteemed a masterly Performance. The President then ad- dress’d himself in a solemn pathetick Exhortation, to the Bachelors, which could not fail of answering the most valuable Purposes, and leaving a lasting Impression on the Minds of all the Pupils. The whole Solemnity being finished, by a short Prayer, the Procession returned back to the City-Arms, where an elegant Entertainment was provided by the Governors of the College. This important Occasion drew together a numerous Assembly of People of all Orders, and it gave me a sincere Pleasure to see the Exercises performed in a Manner, which must reflect Honour upon the College and incite every Friend of his Country, to promote so useful, so well regulated an Institution.” 
At the same Commencement, the degree of Master of 
Arts was conferred upon thirteen gentlemen who had been 
educated elsewhere. 
There was no public Commencement for the class of 
1759. Of the six candidates admitted in 1755, one “in his 
third year went to Philadelphia College,” one “about the 
middle of his second year went into the army,” one, “after

three years went to merchandize ;” one, “after three years 1760 
went to nothing ;” one, “after about two years went to 
privateering.” Epenetus Townsend alone of the six re- 
mained, and, without any ceremony, he “was admitted 
B.A. pro Forma and William Hanna was admitted by 
Diploma, bred at Jersey Col.” 
In October, 1759, Dr. Johnson was again driven away 
from the city by fear of the small-pox. He spent the win- 
ter with his son at Stratford, Connecticut. During his 
absence, Professor Treadwell and Mr. Cutting conducted 
the business of the College, under the general supervision 
of a Committee of the Governors. This winter of his 
absence was one of anxiety and sorrow to President John- 
son. He left Mr. Treadwell, his “best Tutor,” in declin- 
ing health, and Mr. Cutting, therefore, overburdened with 
duty. Early in the spring of 1760 Mr. Treadwell died 
of consumption. At about the same time, in April, 1760, 
the College and the President met with another severe loss 
in the death of Benjamin Nicoll, stepson of the President, 
one of the wisest, most energetic, and influential members 
of the Board of Governors. ‘The whole city was in 
tears at his sudden and untimely death, at the age of forty- 
two ; the friends of the College seemed to be under a con- 
sternation ; but the blow was still more severe to Dr. 
Johnson himself. He was now almost ready to despond ; 
and when he returned to New York in May following, he 
found the scene so changed that the city appeared to him 
like a kind of wilderness. .. . On his return he en- 
deavored to keep up his spirits as well as he could, by an 
indefatigable application to business, hoping to retrieve, in 
some measure, the damages the College had sustained dur- 
ing his absence. The building was so far completed that 
he removed into it, and commenced housekeeping, a little 
above forty years after he had first done the same in the 
College at New Haven.” }

26 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1760 It is noted in the records that the College building was 
so far completed in May, 1760, that the officers and stu- 
dents “ began to Lodge and Diet in it.” In the month of 
June following, the first Commencement of the College 
from its own building was held. In an account of the 
exercises, the Vew York Gazette or Weekly Post Boy, of 
Monday, June 80, 1760, No. 912, says : — 
“On Tuesday last, a publick commencement was held in this City. In the morning the College Hall was opened with a short and elegant Latin speech by the Rev. President; from whence the students and Candidates dressed in their Gowns, and un- covered, proceeded to St. George’s Chapel, followed by the Governors of the College, and other Gentlemen.” The account 
concludes with the statement that “The Audience on this Occasion was large and polite, and expressed a great satisfac- tion at the Order, Decency and Judiciousness, with which the whole was conducted.” 
In honor of George II and in accordance with the terms 
of the Charter, the building thus completed was called 
“King’s College,” and was surmounted by an iron crown, 
which is still preserved, a witness to its royal foundation. 
The Rev. Dr. Burnaby, an English traveller in the Prov- 
ince at that time, wrote of it: “The College when fin- 
ished will be exceedingly handsome. It is to be built on three sides of a quadrangle fronting Hudson’s or North 
River, and will be the most beautifully situated of any college, I believe, in the world. At present only one wing 
is finished, which is of stone, and consists of twenty-four 
sets of apartments, each having a large sitting-room with 
a study and bedchamber.” President Myles Cooper de- 
scribed the College as it was in 1778: “The College is situated on a dry gravelly soil, about one hundred and fifty yards from the bank of the Hudson River, which it 
overlooks ; commanding from the eminence on which it 
stands, a most extensive and beautiful prospect of the opposite shore and country of New Jersey, the City and

of the Harbor, etc., ete. ; and being totally unencumbered 
by any adjacent buildings, and admitting the purest circu- 
lation of air from the river, and every other quarter, has 
the benefit of as agreeable and healthy a situation as can 
possibly be conceived.” } 
In March, 1761, Edward Willett was appointed steward. 
He was to have the use of two rooms and a kitchen in the 
College, and such part of the garden as the President 
might allow; he was to keep the students’ rooms clean 
and have their beds made, and to provide for such as 
might choose to “diet with him” upon terms to be 
agreed upon. It was ordered “also the students Break- 
fast, Dine and Sup together in the College Hall, but that 
they be allowed no meat at their Suppers.” The rent of 
rooms in the College building for students was fixed at 
£4 per annum. A committee, consisting of the Reverend 
Messrs. Barclay, Johnson and Auchmuty, and Mr. John 
Livingston, was appointed “to settle the Rates that the 
students are to pay for their Diet.” The Committee 
established rules, which are here given : —

The vacancy occasioned by the death of Professor Tread- 
well was not supplied for more than a year, President 
Johnson and Mr. Cutting, with the assistance for a time 
of Mr. Samuel Giles as a mathematical teacher, conduct- 
ing the whole of the instruction. In November, 1761, Mr. 
Robert Harpur, a graduate of the University of Glasgow, 
was chosen Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philos- 
ophy, much to the relief of the President and the efficiency 
of the College. In June, 1762, the last Commencement 
under the Presidency of Dr. Johnson was held. The 
President had for some two. years been in correspondence 
with the Archbishop of Canterbury with regard to some 
suitable person to assist him in the instruction and gov- 
ernment of the College and ultimately to succeed him as 
President. The person finally selected was the Rey. 
Myles Cooper, Master of Arts and Fellow of Queen’s 
College, Oxford, a young man twenty-five years of age, 
“a Gentleman recommended by his Grace the Archbishop 
of Canterbury, for his distinguished Learning, firm At- 
tachment to our happy Constitution, Probity, and amiable 
Character.” On November 16, 1762, Mr. Cooper was 
introduced to the Board of Governors at their meeting, 
was elected a Fellow and Professor of Moral Philosophy 
and to assist the President of the College “in the Goy- 
ernment thereof and the Education therein,” at a salary 
of £150 sterling per annum, at 80 per cent exchange, 
“to commence from August 24 last” (the date of his 
setting sail from England). Dr. Johnson had not in- 
tended to resign the Presidency till after the next Com-

mencement in May, but the sudden death of his wife in 1763 
February, 1763, led him to relinquish his office shortly 
thereafter and leave the city. On his retiring from the 
College, Dr. Johnson took up his residence with his son 
at Stratford, Connecticut, and resumed the charge of his 
mission there, which he had relinquished to serve King’s 
College. 
“Dr. Johnson continued, through the remainder of 
his life, to fill up his time in a manner worthy of his 
station and character. He pursued his studies with the 
same eagerness that animated his younger years. He 
kept up his correspondence with all his European friends 
that were still living, and was very punctual and faithful 
in answering their expectations in this way. His diffi- 
culty in writing occasioned him not to be so exact with 
his friends in America, who were better acquainted with 
his case, and could more easily excuse him. Yet when 
anything of real consequence was depending, he consulted 
not his own ease but would write as fully and particularly 
to them as the subject required. At the same time he 
was attentive to the business of his mission. He com- 
monly read prayers and preached twice on every Sunday, 
and performed the ordinary parochial duties.” 
He died on the morning of January 6, 1772. 
“Two days after, his remains were interred in the chan- 
cel of Christ Church, Stratford, where a handsome monu- 
ment has been erected to his memory, with the following 
inscription, composed by a friend, who greatly loved and 
respected him. “M.S.

CHAPTER III 
1754-1763 
ENDOWMENT AND CURRICULUM 
Art one of the earliest meetings of the Board of Gov- 
ernors it was resolved to send addresses to the Archbishop 
of Canterbury and other friends of the College in Eng- 
land soliciting aid, and a committee was appointed to 
prepare them. It was not, however, till May, 1758, that 
such addresses were prepared and sent. In 1762 Dr. 
James Jay, who was going to England on business of his 
own, offered to take upon himself the task of soliciting 
and collecting subscriptions. His generous offer was 
accepted and he received the authority and instructions 
of the Governors for that purpose. On arriving in Eng- 
land he found Dr. William Smith engaged in the same 
enterprise for the College at Philadelphia, now the Uni- 
versity of Pennsylvania. As the Archbishop of Canter- 
bury, and others who were friendly to both Colleges, 
thought that an attempt to make separate collections 
might prove injurious, a united appeal was determined 
upon. Accordingly, letters patent were obtained from 
King George the Third, authorizing a collection. These 
letters set forth : — 
« Whereas it hath been represented unto Us, upon the joint 
Petition of William Smith, Doctor in Divinity, Agent for the 
Trustees of the College, Academy, and Charitable School of 
Philadelphia, in the Province of Pennsylvania, and Provost of 
the Seminary ; and of James Jay, Doctor of Physick, Agent 
for the Governors of the College of the Province of New York, 
in the City of New York, in America: 
“That the great Growth of those Provinces and the continual

32 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1762 Accession of People to them from different Parts of the World, 
being some years ago observed by several of Our good Subjects 
there, they became seriously impressed with the View of the 
Inconveniences that must necessarily arise among so mixt a 
Multitude, if left destitute of the necessary means of Instruc- 
tion, differing In Language and Manners, unenlightened by 
Religion, uncemented by a common Education, strangers to 
the Humane Arts, and to the just use of rational Liberty: that 
these Considerations were rendered the more alarming by sun- 
dry other Circumstances, and particularly” the prevalence of 
false teachers, who were especially active “in the Two impor- 
tant and central Provinces aforesaid.” 
“That from a deep Sense of these growing Evils, the Two 
Seminaries aforesaid, distant about One hundred Miles from 
each other, were begun in Two of the most important and pop- 
ulous trading Cities in Our American Dominions, nearly at the 
same Time and with the same View; not so much to aim at 
any high Improvement in Knowledge, as to guard against total 
Ignorance; to instil into the Minds of Youth just principles 
of Religion, Loyalty and a Love of Our excellent Constitution ; 
to instruct them in such Branches of Knowledge and useful 
Arts as are necessary to Trade, Agriculture, and a due Improve- 
ment of Our valuable Colonies; and to assist in raising up a 
Succession of faithful Instructors, to be sent forth not only 
among our Subjects there, but also among the Indians in Alli- 
ance with us... . 
“That, for the better answering these great and important 
Purposes, the aforesaid Seminaries are under the Direction of 
the Chief Officers of Government, sundry of the Clergy of 
different Denominations, and other Persons of Distinction in 
the respective Cities where they are placed; and their Useful- 
ness has been so generally felt and acknowledged, that amidst 
the Calamities of an Expensive War, near Ten Thousand 
Pounds Sterling have been contributed in each of the said 
Provinces towards their respective Seminaries, and some Hun- 
dreds of Youth are continually educated as well on Charity as 
otherwise: But as Designs of so extensive a Nature, even in 
the most wealthy Kingdoms, have seldom been completed 
unless with the united Generosity of many private Benefac- 
tors, and often by the particular Bounty of Sovereign Princes, 
the Petitioners are persuaded it will not be thought strange 
that Individuals in Young Colonies should find all the Re-

sources in their Power inadequate to such a Work, and that 1762 
the Governors and Trustees of the said Seminaries should 
have the just Apprehensions of seeing all that they have 
raised for their Support speedily exhausted, and an End put 
to their Usefulness, unless they can procure Assistance from 
distant Places, as the Expence of each of them is about Four 
hundred Pounds Sterling above their Income ; the defraying of 
which will require an additional capital of above Six Thousand 
Pounds sterling apiece.” . . . 
Therefore a Royal Brief is issued “ under the Great Seal of 
Great Britain authorizing the making a collection throughout 
the Kingdom, from House to House, for the joint and equal Ben- 
efit of the Two Seminaries and Bodies Corporate aforesaid.” 
This document, the original of which is in Lambeth 
Palace Library, was endorsed by Archbishop Secker, of 
Canterbury, with his own hand —“ Brief for New York 
and Philadelphia Colleges, 19 Aug. 1762.” 
It is stated that “near ten thousand pounds sterling” 
had in response to the brief been contributed for each of 
the Colleges named. So far as can be ascertained the 
contributions for King’s College were from the following 
sources: — 
Five or six acres of the King’s Farm, said to be worth 
four or five thousand pounds, were contributed by Trinity 
Church, New York. This constituted an endowment, not 
producing income of much amount for many years, but 
very valuable, consisting as it did of the four blocks, 
bounded by Church, Barclay, Greenwich, and Murray 
streets, and, with the exception of fifteen lots on Park 
Place, still held by the College. 
£3202 from moneys raised by lotteries authorized by 
the General Assembly of the Province of New York. 
£500 per annum out of the excise moneys of the 
Province of New York, for seven years from January 1, 
1754, to pay salaries. 
Subscriptions of the Governors appointed by the Charter, 
who each contributed, some £50, some £100, some £200. 
D
-P-A-G-E-58

1762 Contributions from other gentlemen of the City of 
New York. 
£500 from Sir Charles Hardy, Governor-General of 
New York. 
Bequest of Joseph Murray, his library, and his estate 
worth something over £9000. 
Bequest of the Rev. Dr. Bristow of his library contain- 
ing about 1500 volumes. 
£2041 from Edward Antill. 
£500 sterling from the Society for the Propagation of 
the Gospel in Foreign Parts. 
£50 from Charles Ward Apthorpe. 
Except as otherwise indicated, the contributions were, 
some of them certainly and the others probably, in colo- 
nial currency worth about half their stated value in 
pounds sterling. ‘ 
The Royal Brief resulted in a benefit of about six thou- 
sand pounds sterling to King’s College; and the King 
himself gave four hundred pounds sterling out of his 
private purse. 
Additional contributions are noted in the records, as 
follows : — 
Resolutions of thanks were passed, in June, 1763, to the 
Rt. Hon. William Pitt and the two Universities of Cam- 
bridge and Oxford for “ Generous Donations.” 
£500 bequeathed by Paul Richard. 
£100 bequeathed by James Alexander. 
£100 from General Shirley. 
£200 from General Monckton. 
20 guineas contributed by Mr. Tanner, Rector of Lowe- 
stoff in Suffolk, England. 
Still further contributions of small amount are recorded, 
such as: “two persons unknown gave each a guinea ;” 
“Mr. Noel, Bookseller, gave Romain’s Ed. of M. Callas- 
sio’s Hebr. Concordance 4 vol. fol.;” “Sundry Gentle- 
men at Oxford gave Books whose names are in them ;”
-P-A-G-E-59
  ENDOWMENT AND CURRICULUM 35 
“Mr. Kilbourn painter gave the President Dr. J ohnson’s 1770 
picture ;” “Dr. Morton sent a Curious Collection of 
Ancient Alphabets on Copperplate;” “ Bartholomew 
Crannell gave sundry books for the library ; ” « Jacob 
Le Roy, Esq., gave the organ ; ia the Bell.” 
In February, 1767, a committee of the Governors, previ- 
ously appointed for the purpose, reported that they had 
petitioned Sir Henry Moore, Governor of the Province of 
New York, for twenty-four thousand acres of land, and 
that his Majesty’s Council had advised that the petition 
be granted. In the letters patent making the grant, 
issued March 14, 1770, the land is spoken of as being 
«within the limits formerly claimed by the government 
of New Hampshire,” and is described as “all that certain 
tract or parcel of land within our province of New York 
situate, lying and being in the county of Albany on the 
west side of Connecticut river beginning at a beech tree 
marked with the letters W K,” etc. It was ordained 
«that the said tract of twenty-four thousand acres should 
be erected into a township by the name of Kingsland.” 
On March 20, 1770, the Committee of the Governors 
reported that the lands were situate in the new County of 
Gloucester [which had been set off from the County of 
Albany], in the Province of New York, and that the 
Governor had been pleased to constitut> Kingsland the 
county town of the county. The Committee further 
reported measures for encouraging settlement and for 
granting leases to settlers. 
In April, 1774, Governor Tryon, of the Province of 
New York, “for the Esteem which he bears to the said 
College and from a Desire of advancing as well the 
Interests thereof as to promote and extend its Usefulness 
in disseminating the Principles of Virtue, Literature and 
Loyalty and also for and in Consideration of the Sum of 
Five Shillings of lawful Money of the Province of New 
York to him in Hand paid,” granted and conveyed to the   
 
-P-A-G-E-60
36 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1774 Governors of King’s College ten thousand acres of land 
also situate in the County of Gloucester. Any and all 
income from this tract was to be applied to the support 
and maintenance of “One or more Professorship or Pro- 
fessorships of and in the said Seminary in such Branch 
or Branches of Literature as to the said Corporation shall 
seem expedient ” “The said Professors when estab- 
lished . . . to be severally called and known by the 
Name of Tryonran Proressors the first Professor so to 
be appointed to be a professor of the municipal Laws of 
England.” 
It does not appear that any Tryonian Professor was 
ever appointed. 
All anticipations of advantage from the grants of Gov- 
ernors Moore and Tryon were disappointed. No im- 
mediate benefit was derived from them, and, subsequently 
to the Revolution, they were wholly lost to the College in 
the settlement of a boundary dispute between the States 
of New York and New Hampshire, whereby the State of 
New York, in consideration of the sum of thirty thousand 
dollars (of which the College received nothing) sur- 
rendered the tracts, which were included in the new State 
of Vermont. “ This treaty,” says President Moore in his 
Sketch, “which the State of New York, from weighty 
considerations of public policy, rather than for the paltry 
sum of money paid, found it expedient to make, sur- 
rendered a property belonging to the College, which 
would at this day have been of immense value, and in so 
doing, may be regarded as having given to the College a 
claim for retribution, which all that the State has since 
done for it does not fully satisfy.” 
It is not known that any further or other contributions 
or grants were made for the benefit of King’s College. 
A meeting of the Governors of the College was held on 
August 4, 1774, to receive the report of a “Committee 
appointed to Prepare the Draft of a Royal Charter 
 
-P-A-G-E-61
ENDOWMENT AND CURRICULUM 87 
Constituting the Seminary an University,” ete. A copy 1763 
of the minutes of this meeting, containing in full the pro- 
posed Charter ordaining, among other things, that “ King’s 
College shall be the Mother of the American University,” 
may be found in the library of the Trustees in the office 
of their clerk. : 
Minutes of meetings of the Governors after this (if we 
except the certified copy of the minutes of a meeting 
held May 17, 1781, mentioned by President Moore in his 
Sketch) and any official record of contributions that may 
have been kept by the Governors, are not obtainable — 
having probably been destroyed during the occupancy 
of the College buildings for military purposes during the 
Revolution, or lost after the removal of the College Library 
and effects to the City Hall in 1776. 
On March 1, 1763, a committee, appointed November 16, 
1762, “to inquire into the state and circumstances of the 
College and the manner of Education, and prepare such 
Laws and Regulations, as they shall conceive necessary 
for the better ordering and good Government thereof,” 
reported “ That upon examination of the present Plan of 
Education, and Body of Laws, which were established in 
the Infancy of the College and then well adapted: They 
are of Opinion, That considerable Additions, Amendments 
and Alterations both in the present Plan of Education and 
Body of Laws, are become absolutely necessary, and which 
they now present to the Governors for their Approbation.” 
The “Laws and Orders of the College of New York 
adopted June 8, 1755,” and the “Plan of Education ? 
recommended by the Committee and adopted by the 
Board to supersede them, are given in Appendix B. 
In May, 1768, it was “ Ordered that the Committee that 
were appointed for Building the College be a Committee 
to inclose the College Ground with a Fence of Posts & 
Rails.” A year later, in May, 1764, a Committee was 
appointed “ to inclose the Ground fronting the South side 
 
-P-A-G-E-62
38 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1763 of the College within a Board Fence” ; and in October of 
the same year the Committee was further empowered to 
build a lodge for the porter, to level the College yard, and 
to plant trees along the fence. The trees here provided 
_ for were planted by hands that had much to do subse- 
quently with laying the foundations of the Republic. 
In speaking of the removal of the College from College 
Place in 1857, the Hon. John Jay, of the class of 1836, 
grandson of the first Chief-Justice of the United States, 
said, in an address before the Alumni of the College, 
December 21, 1876: “It is a matter for regret that some 
of the stately sycamores which adorned the College Green 
were not preserved. . . . Those venerable trees had an 
historic interest from the fact which, when a boy, I heard 
from the lips of Judge Benson during one of his visits to 
my grandfather at Bedford, that those trees were carried 
to the green by himself, Jay, Robert R. Livingston, and, 
I think, Richard Harison, and planted by their own 
hands.” 
The troubles to which the regulations and the “fence” 
gave rise may be gathered from a Book of Misdemeanors 
alias Black Book which has been preserved. From it 
are taken the following examples of offences and their 
punishment : — 
8. “reprimanded publicly at a visitation for having come 
thro’ a Hole in the College fence, at 12 o’clock at Night.” S. 
“ suspended by the President for coming over the College fence 
at 4 past 11 o’clock last Night.” V., D., and N., “who had 
gone over the College fence the preceding Tuesday, between the 
Hours of 3 and 4 p.m., to bathe, . . . after being reprimanded, 
were ordered by the Committee to be confined to College untill 
the next Saturday Evening — each of them was also directed 
to translate into Latin 4 pages of Dr. Chandler’s Charity 
Sermon, besides attending the usual Collegiate exercises.” D. 
“to be represented to the Committee, ye next visitation, for 
refusing to open his Door when repeatedly called upon by the 
President, (being sent for also from home, where he had not 
 
-P-A-G-E-63

been for some days) and causing four Doors to be broke open 1763 
before he could be laid hold of —N.B. found, at last, in the 
Room opposite to his own, where he had hid himself, having 
opened the Door with a false key, and hid himself in one of 
the studies.” “Students going without their Caps and Gowns 
to be presented to the next Board of Governors.” “ Ordered 
that B. and D. , for being deficient each in two exercises, 
and also for frequently absenting themselves from Recitations, 
be confined within the College walls from next Monday till the 
Friday following; and also, besides their usual academical 
exercise, translate No. 316 of the Spectator into Latin, and get 
by Heart 40 lines from the Beginning of Book 1, Sat. 1 of 
Horace. In case of Failure or Neglect in any of these Particu- 
lars to be immediately presented to the Board of Governors 
for Degradation or Expulsion.” D., “for stealing 8 sheets of 
Paper and a Penknife, was reprimanded in the College Hall 
before all the students, and after having his Gown stripped off 
by the Porter, he was ordered to kneel down and read a paper 
containing an Acknowledgment of his Crime, expressing much 
sorrow for it, and promising Amendment for the future — He 
was then forbidden to wear his Gown or Cap for one Week.” 
The meeting of the Governors in March, 1763, was a 
busy and a fruitful one. In addition to action already 
noted, the Board appointed Professor Harpur Librarian, 
at a small salary, with directions to make a catalogue of 
the books; and also, “as the Credit, Reputation and In- 
crease of the College in a great Measure depend upon hay- 
ing a good and reputable Grammar School annexed to By 
appointed a Committee “ to prepare a plan for such a school 
and report as soon as conveniently they can.” On the 12th 
of April following the plan was reported and adopted by 
the Board. It provided that — the school should be a part 
of the College and under the direction of the Governors ; 
the Master should have a salary of £150 per annum, and, 
in case the tuition fees should be more than enough to pay 
the salary of the Master and the seat of the schoolhouse, 
he should have, in addition to his salary, 40s. per annum 
“for every such supernumerary scholar”; the Master 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
40 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1763 should not teach more than thirty-two scholars without an 
usher nor more than seventy with one usher ; the tuition 
fee should be £6 per annum, and, as gratuity to the Master, 
a guinea for entrance; the Governors and the Master 
should choose the books for the classes, with the editions ; 
the hours for teaching in the school from the vernal to the 
autumnal equinox should be, in the morning, from six to 
eight o’clock and from ten to twelve, and, in the afternoon, 
from two till four and from five to six, and from the 
autumnal to the vernal equinox from eight in the morning 
until nine and from ten to twelve, and in the afternoon 
from two till four ; the vacations should be two weeks at 
Christmas and one week each at Easter, Whitsuntide, and 
Michaelmas ; public days, such as the King’s birthday, etc., 
and also Saturdays and Thursdays in the afternoon, should 
be holidays, so far as attendance at school was concerned, 
but the Master should, at his discretion, set exercises for 
those days as well as in the stated vacations ; every scholar 
should, before Christmas every year, provide one load of 
nut wood for the use of the school; not only should the 
Latin and Greek languages be taught, but the students 
should also be instructed in the English language ; the 
Master himself should be particularly careful of the exer- 
cises of the superior classes, as well those in English as in 
the other languages. 
The Committee was authorized to collect subscriptions 
for the school. 
At a meeting of the Governors on the twenty-fourth of 
August following, the Committee reported that the school 
had been opened with Matthew Cushing of Charlestown in 
Massachusetts as Master ; that a number of scholars were 
in attendance and more were expected. 
In November following the number of pupils was 
twenty-seven “and many more soon expected.” Mr. 
Alexander Leslie, an alumnus of the College of the Class 
of 62, was to be engaged as usher.

CHAPTER IV 
1763-1775 
PRESIDENT MYLES COOPER 
Dr. Jounson resigned the presidency March 1, 1763, 
and it was ordered that “the thanks of this Corporation 
be given to the said Doctor Johnson for his faithful ser- 
vices in his Station.” Subsequently, the Governors ex- 
pressed more fully their appreciation of his devotion and 
value and voted him a pension of £50 per annum, a 
very small amount, but as large as their circumstances 
would allow. Mr. Cooper took temporary charge as 
acting President, and on the 12th of April following 
was unanimously elected President. 
The first Commencement at which President Cooper 
presided was held in May, 1764, in St. George’s Chapel, 
Trinity Parish, corner of Beekman and Cliff streets, and 
was attended by General Gage and His Majesty’s Council. 
On this occasion the salutatory was delivered by Richard 
Harison, then seventeen years of age, and an address on 
the blessings of peace was pronounced by John Jay, the 
other member of the graduating class. 
On Mr. Cooper’s accession to the presidency a new Plan 
of Education and Body of Laws were put into effect, and 
the Grammar School was soon thereafter started. 
President Cooper, Tutor Cutting, and Professor Harpur 
gave all the instruction to students of the College, till Mr. 
Cutting’s resignation in October, 1763. Mr. Cutting’s 
place was found very difficult to fill, and it was not till 
October, 1765, that Samuel Clossy, M.D., of Trinity 
Jollege, Dublin, a gentleman of repute in his own country 
42 
 
-P-A-G-E-67
PRESIDENT MYLES COOPER 43 
as scholar, author, and practitioner, was chosen his suc- 1773 
cessor. Dr. Clossy was made also Professor of Natural 
Philosophy, Professor Harpur confining himself thereafter 
to Mathematics. Professor Harpur resigned in February, 
1767, and it does not appear that any one was appointed 
to succeed him. 
In August, 1767, the Governors instituted a Medical 
School within the College, and appointed a committee of 
their own body to regulate it. 
President Cooper went to England in 1771, and re- 
mained for nearly a year, on matters connected with the 
College and with the Church in whose counsels he was 
prominent. During his absence the Rev. Dr. Charles 
Inglis, one of the Governors and subsequently Bishop of 
Nova Scotia, appears to have acted in his place.! 
In 1773 Washington entered his stepson and ward, 
John Parke Custis, as a student. The memorandum in 
the Matricula after his name is “Staid only four months.” 
His brief stay was not due to any dissatisfaction with 
the College, on his part or on that of his stepfather, but 
to his attachment to a young daughter of Judge Calvert of 
Maryland whom he subsequently married. In the quaint 
language of the day, “owing to the Impression of this 
Passion” he could not long apply himself to study and 
hastened away. Letters of his to Colonel Washington 
and to his mother give a tranquil and pleasing view of 
life in King’s College in his time. Under date of July 5, 
1773, Custis writes to his guardian : — 
“Tt gives me pleasure that I now have it in my Power to 
inform you how agreeably everything is settled; there is noth- 
ing that has been omitted by my good Friend Doctor Cooper 
which was necessary to my contentment in this place, and 
Gratitude as well as Truth oblidges me to say that the other 
Professors are not the least remiss in their Duty, but give all 
the assistance they can consistent with the Duty they owe to 
1 George H. Moore. 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
44 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1778 the other students. I attend at stated hours, the Professors in 
Mathematicks, Languages, Moral and experimental Philosophy, 
& I hope the Progress I make in these useful branches of 
knowledge will redown not only to my own credit, but to the 
Credit of those who have been instrumental in placing me here, 
and in particular render you some compensation and Satisfac- 
tion for the parental Care and Attention you have always and 
upon all occasions manifested towards me and which demand 
my most grateful thanks & returns to make which shall be the 
constant care of J. P. Custis.” 
Like a true Virginian young Custis had his saddle 
horses with him, and of one of them he says, in the letter 
just quoted : “He is a horse I know to be good, and one 
I have a vast affection for and except riding there is no 
other exercise to be us’d here,” from which it would ap- 
pear that athletic sports, which now engage so much atten- 
tion, had then no place in collegiate training. 
Dr. Cooper, writing about the same date to Colonel 
Washington, relates of young Custis that “He lives now 
altogether in the College and dines with the Professors 
and myself in the College Hall. He has fitted up a Room 
in a neat plain Taste, attends his Instructors punctually, 
and I doubt not will make a proficiency equal to ye warm- 
est wishes and expectations of his best Friends. He has 
already gained much upon ye Affections of his Instructors, 
which is a circumstance that cannot fail of producing 
very beneficial effects with regard both to his learning 
and Happiness, during his residence in this Place.” 
In a letter to his mother young Mr. Custis writes : — 
“Tt is now time to give you a short plan of my apartments 
and of my way of living. I have a large parlour with two 
studys or closets, each large enough to contain a bed, trunk 
and couple of chairs, one I sleep in and the other Joe [pre- 
sumably his servant] calls his, my chamber and parlour are 
papered, with a cheap tho’ very pretty paper, the other is 
painted; my furniture consists of six chairs, 2 tables, with a 
few paultry Pictures. I have an excellent bed, and in short 
 
-P-A-G-E-69
PRESIDENT MYLES COOPER 45 
everything very convenient and clever. I generally get up 1778 
about six or a little after, dress myself and go to Chappel, by 
the time that prayers are over, Joe has me a little breakfast, 
to which I sit down very contentedly, & after eating heartyly, 
I thank God and go to my Studys, with which I am employed 
till twelve, then I take a walk and return about one, dine 
with the Professors and after Dinner study till six at which 
time the Bell always rings for Prayers, they being over 
College is broak up and then we take what amusement we 
please.” 
Some of these amusements were doubtless such as are 
referred to in the “ Black Book.” But there were others 
of a different kind, such as, for example, were afforded by 
a “ Literary Society for the encouragement of learning & 
the excitement of emulation and attendance among the 
students of the College.” This society was organized as 
early as June, 1766, and was, in all probability, the Club 
in which, in 1774 or thereabouts, Alexander Hamilton 
exercised himself in public debate and is said to have 
gained distinction. 
Under the date of 1773, the Matricula notes, “This 
year John Vardill, M.A., was elected Fellow and Pro- 
fessor of Natural Law.” John Vardill was an alumnus 
of King’s College of the class of 66. He was one of the 
few graduates of the College who sympathized with and 
supported the Tory principles of his Professor and Presi- 
dent, Dr. Cooper. President Moore, in his Sketch, says of 
him: “He must have left this country very soon after his 
appointment if indeed he were not absent when it was 
made, for the writer of a letter from London, in the be- 
ginning of 1775, speaks of him as ‘Parson Vardill, a 
native of New York, who has been here a twelvemonth, a 
ministerial writer under the signature of Coriolanus, lately 
appointed King’s Professor in the College of New York 
with a salary of £200 sterling.’” A letter from Pro- 
fessor Vardill to Colonel Washington, dated “King’s 
College Sept. 1778,” which has recently been published, 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
46 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1774 shows, however, that he actually occupied the chair to 
which he was appointed, though probably for but a brief 
period. 
When President Cooper returned from England, the 
preliminary contests of the approaching Revolution had 
commenced. He warmly espoused the side of the King, 
and used voice and pen on behalf of the Crown. The 
general spirit and tenor of his contentions may be 
gathered from A Friendly Address to all Reasonable 
Americans on the Subject of our Political Confusions, 
which he wrote, and had “ Printed for the Purchasers, 
1774.” In this he set forth the wisdom of the English 
Constitution, under which “ the subjects of Great Britian 
are the happiest people on earth,” and of all such subjects, 
“those who reside in the American Colonies have been, 
and, were they sensible of their own advantages, might 
still be, by far the happiest”; minimized the exactions 
and evils of which the people complained ; ridiculed the 
idea that a tax of three pence a pound on tea exported to 
America justified the resentment and the opposition which 
it occasioned ; insisted that “the ill consequences of open 
disrespect to government are so great, that no misconduct 
of the administration can justify or excuse it”; declared 
“there is too much reason to believe that our minds are 
unprincipled and our hearts disposed for rebellion”; as- 
serted the futility of resistance, as the “island of Britian 
is able to govern ten such Americas, if she will exert her 
power” ; stated “it is morally certain that, in the day of 
trial, a large majority of the Americans will heartily unite 
with the King’s troops, in reducing America to order. 
Our violent Republicans will then find themselves deserted 
by thousands and thousands in whom they now confide, and 
inexpressibly dreadful must be their disappointment ;” 
and expressed the opinion that “a rebellion of the Colo- 
nies, whether it should prove successful or unsuccessful, 
would necessarily terminate in ruin and destruction.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-71
PRESIDENT MYLES COOPER AT 
Though Dr. Cooper had exercised the influence and 1775 
the authority of the Presidency of the College for a 
dozen years, was an elegant scholar, a wit, a facile writer 
in prose and verse, a charming conversationalist, a popu- 
lar and most welcome member of polite society, he failed 
to attract to the support of his political views any con- 
siderable number of the students and alumni of King’s 
College. He found among them, indeed, some of his 
most active and most effective opponents. In one of his 
political controversies, he is said to have been worsted by 
an anonymous writer, whom he afterward discovered to 
be Alexander Hamilton, a student in one of the younger 
classes of the College at the time. In speaking of two 
of Hamilton’s pamphlets in reply to a Loyalist, Professor 
Moses Coit Tyler says: “It is not easy to overstate the 
astonishment and incredulity with which the public soon 
heard the rumor, that those elaborate and shattering liter- 
ary assaults on the argumentative position of the Loyal- 
ists were, in reality, the work of a writer who was then 
both a stripling in years and a stranger in the country 
—one Alexander Hamilton, a West Indian by birth, a 
Franco-Scotsman by parentage, an undergraduate of 
King’s College by occupation, a resident within the 
Thirteen Colonies but little more than two years, and 
at the time of the publication of his first pamphlet only 
seventeen years of age.” 4 
The indignation of President Cooper’s political adver- 
saries finally found expression in a violent letter addressed 
to him and four other gentlemen of the city by name. 
The letter may be found in the American Archives, 
4th series, Volume II, Column 389, and is in large part 
as follows : — 
“ PuapeLpuia, April 25th, 1775. 
“It appears from a number of authentick letters from 
London, that the present hostile preparations against the

-P-A-G-E-72
  48 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1775 American Colonies were occasioned by nothing but assurances 
from you of the defection and submission of the Colony of 
New York. It is impossible to unfold the extensive and 
complicated nature of your crimes. You have defeated the 
attempts of the Congress to bring about a constitutional 
reconciliation with Great Britain.... But you have done 
more; you have unsheathed the sword of Britain, and pointed 
it against the bosom of your country. You have held up a 
signal for a Civil War; and all the calamities of Towns in 
flames, a desolated Country, butchered fathers, and weeping 
widows and children, now lay entirely at your doors... . 
Repeated insults and unparalleled oppressions have reduced 
the Americans to a state of desperation. Executions of vil- 
lains in effigy will now no longer gratify their resentment. 
The injury you have done to your country can not 
admit of reparation. Fly for your lives, or anticipate your 
doom by becoming your own executioners. 
“THREE MiLLions.” 
A fortnight after the date of this letter, on the night of 
May 10, an angry mob went to the lodgings of Dr. Cooper 
in the College to execute vengeance upon him. One of 
the students hastened on before to warn the President, 
who was in bed and asleep, of his danger. When the 
crowd gathered at the College, Alexander Hamilton and 
Robert Troup, of the class of ’74, mounted the steps to 
keep the people at bay, and Hamilton addressed them in 
an impassioned speech on the impropriety of their con- 
duct and the disgrace they were bringing on the cause 
of liberty by their excesses. The delay thus occasioned 
enabled the President to escape over the back fence, in 
very scanty apparel. In some verses descriptive of this 
occasion, which Dr. Cooper afterward wrote, he says, 
after speaking of his being aroused from slumber by — 
“ A heaven directed youth, 
‘Whom oft my lessons led to truth,” ... 
“IT wake —I fly — while loud and near, 
Dread execrations wound my ear, 
And sore my soul dismay.

PRESIDENT MYLES COOPER 
One avenue alone remained, 
A speedy passage there I gained, 
And winged my rapid way. 
“ That moment, all the furious throng, 
An entrance forcing, poured along, 
And filled my peaceful cell ; 
Where harmless jest, and modest mirth, 
And cheerful laughter oft had birth 
And joy was wont to dwell. 
“Nor yet content — but hoping still 
Their impious purpose to fulfil, 
They force each yielding door: 
And while their curses load my head 
With piercing steel they probe the bed, 
And thirst for human gore. 
“ Meanwhile along the sounding shore, 
Where Hudson’s waves incessant roar, 
I work my weary way; 
And skirt the windings of the tide, 
My faithful pupil by my side, 
Nor wish the approach of day.” 
After wandering along the river bank till near morning 
he found refuge in the house of a friend till the following 
night, when he embarked on an English sloop of war 
in the harbor, the Kingfisher, Captain James Montagu, 
in which he went to England. On the supposition that 
his absence would be but temporary, the Governors, on 
May 16, appointed as Preses pro tempore Revd. Ben- 
jamin Moore, of the class of ’68, afterward Bishop of 
New York. He was to take charge of the College until 
the return of Dr. Cooper, with whom he was to settle as 
to the allowance to be made him out of the President’s 
salary for his care and trouble. Dr. Cooper never re- 
turned to America. He ultimately settled in Edinburgh, 
as minister of the First Episcopal Chapel, and died there, 
suddenly, in 1785.

CHAPTER V 
THE ALUMNI OF KING’S COLLEGE 
1774 THE last public Commencement of King’s College 
was held in Trinity Church on Tuesday, May 17, 1774. 
The New York Gazette and Weekly Mercury said of it: 
“The celebrity was honoured by the presence of his Ex- 
cellency, General Haldimand, the principal officers of the 
Army, the Clergy and a very brilliant Assembly.” “The 
Discourses upon this occasion did great Honour to the 
Performers, who justly merited and received universal 
Approbation.” 
In 1775 there were seven students graduated Bachelor 
of Arts, but “there was no public Commencement this 
year on account of the absence of Dr. Cooper.” 
The students of the class of 76, six in number, who 
had satisfactorily completed the course, received their 
degrees, but there was, as noted in the Matricula, “No 
public Commencement this year. The Turbulence and 
Confusion which prevail in every part of the Country 
effectually suppress every literary Pursuit.” The Matri- 
cula previously states, under the heading “ Anno 1776”; 
“There were no Admissions this year. On the sixth of 
April, a message was sent to the Treasurer of the College 
(signed Robert Benson) from a number of men who stiled 
themselves the Committee of Safety desiring the Governors 
to prepare the College in 6 days for the Reception of 
Troops. In consequence of this Demand, the students 
were dispersed, the Library, Apparatus, etc., were depos- 
ited in the City Hall, and the College was turned into 
50 
 
-P-A-G-E-77
THE ALUMNI OF KING’S COLLEGE 51 
an Hospital.” This seizure of its building occasioned the 1776 
College great loss. President Moore says of it : 
“ Almost all the apparatus and a large portion of the 
books belonging to the College, were wholly lost to it in 
consequence of this removal; and of the books recovered, 
six or seven hundred volumes were so, only after about 
thirty years, when they were found, with as many belong- 
ing to the New York Society Library and some belonging 
to Trinity Church, in a room in St. Paul’s Chapel where, 
it seemed, no one but the Sexton had been aware of their 
existence, and neither he nor any body else could tell how 
they had arrived there. Previous to this dispersion of the 
College Library, it contained, besides books purchased by 
the Governors and those bequeathed by Dr. Bristow and 
by Mr. Murray, many valuable works given by the Earl 
of Bute and other individuals, and from the University of 
Oxford, a copy of every work printed at the University 
Press.” 
The Matricula of King’s College closes with a note of 
the admission, in 1777, of William Walton and James De 
Lancey Walton. It appears, therefore, that some instruc- 
tion continued to be given. When the College building 
became a military hospital, Mr. Leonard Lispenard pro- 
vided a house for. the President, tutors, and students of 
the College, and it was doubtless here that the College 
exercises, so long as they continued, were given. Mr. 
Moore lived in this house, as President ad interim, during 
a part of the war.!_ The Corporation was kept alive by 
occasional meetings of the Governors. The evidences of 
this are not numerous, but they would seem to be suf- 
ficient. There was a meeting on August 4, 1774, to 
which reference has been made; President Moore, in his 
Sketch, states “there exists a certified copy of minutes of 
a meeting [of the Governors] on the 17th of May, 1781” ; 
there is among the papers in the office of the Clerk of the 
Trustees an original memorandum, dated September 14, 
1 Minutes of the Trustees of Columbia College, March 28, 1788.

1776 1781, signed “ William Walton, Sam Bayard, Jun.,” cer- 
tifying “that William Walton, Esquire, and Samuel 
Bayard, Jr., two of the Committee appointed by the Gov- 
ernors of King’s College for letting the lands of the said 
College have agreed with Thomas Lincoln” to grant him 
a lease of certain lots for twenty-one years ; in the minutes 
of the Regents of the University of the State of New York, 
acting as Trustees of Columbia College, February 15, 1785, 
there is notice of the presentation of “a letter from Aug. 
y. Horn, requesting the appointment of a Committee to 
audit his accounts as Treasurer of the late corporation of 
King’s College, and signifying that he thinks himself en- 
titled to a certain salary and for the term of five years 
next preceding the month of May last”; the petition of 
the Governors (or so many of them as remained) to the 
Legislature of New York, 1784, asking that the Charter 
be suitably changed and the College made a University, 
which petition was received as authoritative and acted 
upon by the Legislature. The educational record of the 
College, under its original name, practically closed, how- 
ever, with the execution of the order of the Committee of 
Safety and the bestowal of degrees upon the class of ’76. 
It was the great good fortune and the glory of King’s 
College, in its brief career of twenty-two years, during 
which it educated upwards of one hundred young men, to 
contribute through them, in a remarkable degree, to the 
welfare of the country. In the movements that preceded 
and led up to the Revolution, its alumni bore an honorable 
part in forming public opinion and in directing it aright ; 
in the War of Independence they did their share in bear- 
ing the burdens, and in bringing to a successful issue the 
strife of arms; during the war and after it, they proved 
to be unexcelled in diplomatic skill, in constructive states- 
manship, in judicial wisdom, and in devising and promot- 
ing measures that make for the material and the spiritual 
progress of the State.

clergymen, who became, respectively, the first and the sec- 
ond Bishops of New York in the Episcopal Church, and 
the latter of whom was, also, twice President of the Col- 
lege that bred him; John Stevens was a great engineer, 
conspicuous for his agency in the invention, introduction, 
and gradual improvement of steamboats, and one of the 
first to perceive and point out the practicability and ad- 
vantage of railroads on a large scale; Gouverneur Morris 
was a profound constitutional lawyer, a delegate to and a 
most important member of the United States Constitu- 
tional Convention of 1787, a financier, a diplomatist serv- 
ing his country as a Special Commissioner to England and 
as Minister to France, a Senator of the United States, a 
Canal Commissioner of New York, and, as such, contribut- 
ing in a fundamental and lasting way to the development 
of the internal resources of his native State, “ the associate 
of Clinton in joining the ocean with the lakes.” Of Alex-

   54 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
may close this imperfect record : — 
“At the beginning of that glorious struggle [the Revo- 
lutionary War] Alexander Hamilton was still a youth, 
engaged in pursuing his College studies with that ardour 
and application which characterized all his mental efforts 
throughout life. The momentous questions of the rights 
of the Colonies and the powers of the parent state, had 
been discussed in New York with no ordinary talent on 
both sides. The mind of the future statesman was roused 
by the subject. Like the Swedish warrior who, when he 
heard for the first time the whistling of the bullets about 
him, exclaimed ‘ 7Ais henceforth shall be my music,’ young 
Hamilton, with a nobler instinct, when he then first turned 
his mind to the investigation of great principles, the duties 
of subjects, their rights, and those of their rulers and of 
the state, felt the true vocation of his genius, and rushed 
impatiently forward to enter upon his destined career of a 
patriot statesman. Then it was that his talents were first 
employed in the public service; and . . . ‘America saw 
with astonishment a lad of seventeen in the ranks of her 
advocates, at a time when her advocates were sages and 
patriots.’ A few months more found the same youth the 
companion in arms and the confidential friend of Wash- 
ington.” “It was to his foresight, his influence and elo- 
quence, more than to any other man, perhaps more than 
to all others, that we owe that union of the States under 
the present constitution, which rescued us from weakness 
and anarchy, and gave us a permanent rank among the 
nations of the earth.” ‘The effective defence of this con- 
stitution, its luminous exposition, and its victorious adop- 
tion after a doubtful and embittered contest, give to 
Hamilton other and equally enduring claims upon the 
gratitude of posterity. In his speeches in the convention 
of this State, and in the more expanded vindication and 
exposition of the constitution contained in his numbers 
of the Federalist, whilst the immediate object of clearing 
up doubts, satisfying scruples, and refuting objections was 
victoriously obtained, he has left to succeeding genera- 
tions a treasure of political science, which must ever be 
resorted to as the most authoritative and masterly exposi- 
tion of our constitutional charter, and the most luminous

commentary upon the nature and history of representa- 1776 
tive and federative government. Then succeeded his 
short but brilliant administration of our finances, rendered 
memorable by that efficient organization of the public 
revenue and resources which replenished the bankrupt 
treasury, raised the prostrate national credit and placed 
jt on a firm and durable basis, gave immediate activity to 
commerce and the arts, and security to all their pursuits. 
Tt was memorable too for a series of official reports from his 
pen, which have proved the inexhaustible source of instruc- 
tion, of argument, of authority to our statesmen, political 
economists, jurists and orators, under every administration 
and all forms of parties.” 
“The name of John Jay is gloriously associated with 
that of Alexander Hamilton in the history of our liberties 
and our laws.... At the age of twenty-eight, he 
drafted, and in effect himself formed, the first constitu- 
tion of the State of New York, under which we lived for 
forty-five years, which still forms the basis of our present 
State government, and from which other states have since 
borrowed many of its most remarkable and original pro- 
visions. At that age, as soon as New York threw off her 
colonial character, he was appointed the first Chief-Justice 
of the state. Then followed a long, rapid and splendid 
succession of high trusts and weighty duties, the results 
of which are recorded in the most interesting pages of 
our annals. . . - 
“Tt was from his richly stored mind that proceeded, 
while representing this State in the Congress of the United 
States (over whose deliberations he for a time presided), 
many of those celebrated state papers, whose grave elo- 
quence commanded the admiration of Europe, and drew 
forth the eulogy of the master orators and statesmen of 
the times— of Chatham and Burke — whilst, by the evi- 
dence which they gave to the wisdom and talent that 
guided the councils of America, they contributed to her 
reputation and ultimate triumph as much as the most 
signal victories of her arms. As our Minister at Madrid 
and Paris, his sagacity penetrated, and his calm firmness 
defeated, the intricate wiles of the diplomatists and cabi- 
nets of Europe, until in illustrious association with Frank- 
lin and John Adams, he settled and signed the definitive 
treaty of peace, recognizing and confirming our national

1776 independence. On his return home a not less illustrious association awaited him in a not less illustrious cause — the establishment and defence of the present constitution, with Hamilton and Madison. The last Secretary of For- eign Affairs under the old confederation, he was selected by Washington as the first Chief-Justice of the United States under the new constitution. I need not speak of the talent with which he discharged the duties of this latter station. ... His able negotiation and commercial treaty with Great Britain, and his six years’ administra- tion as Governor of this State, completed his public life. As the character of Hamilton presents, in its soldierlike frankness and daring, a beautiful example of the spirit of chivalry applied to the pursuits of the statesman, so in that of Jay, pure and holy justice seemed to be embodied. He lived as one — 
“«Sent forth of the Omnipotent, to run 
The great career of justice.’ 
“ After a long and uninterrupted series of the highest civil employments in the most difficult times, he suddenly re- tired from their toils and dignities, in the full vigour of mind and body, and at an age when, in most statesmen, the objects of ambition show as gorgeously, and its aspirations are as stirring as ever. . . . For the last thirty years of his remaining life, he was known to us only by the occa- sional appearance of his name, or the employment of his pen in the service of piety or philanthropy. A halo of veneration seemed to encircle him, as one belonging to another world, though yet lingering amongst us. When the tidings of his death came to us, they were received through the nation, not with sorrow or mourning, but with solemn awe; like that with which we read the mysterious passage of ancient scripture —‘ And Enoch walked with God, and he was not, for God took him.’” “Eloquent and learned, graced with taste and fancy, the accomplishments of elegant letters and arts, and the acquisitions of solid science, Robert R. Livingston was the fellow-labourer of Jay and Hamilton in achieving the liberties of the United States, and in rearing the fabric of our civil institutions, as well as their ablest rival and opponent in the subsequent division of parties. He filled for twenty-five years the first law office of this State 3 and

during that period of the Revolution, in which the best 1776 talent of the nation was employed in the diplomatic ser- vice, acted as Secretary of Foreign Affairs to Congress, with an ability and talent at that time duly estimated, but which had fallen into oblivion, and become unknown to most of the present generation, until their effects were again conspicuously brought to light by thé very recently published diplomatic correspondence of the American Revolution. These alone are signal claims to distinc- tion; but in him they are lost in the blaze of far brighter 
and more lasting honours. His first act as an American statesman, was as one of the Committee of five (Jefferson, 
Franklin, John Adams, Roger Sherman and Robert R. Livingston) who, in the Congress of 1776, prepared and presented the Declaration of Independence. His last political transaction was the negotiating and concluding that treaty which added to our empire Louisiana, with the command of the Mississippi and that vast territory whence one mighty state after another is now succes- sively bursting into life. Thus the name of Livingston is deeply inscribed upon the very corner-stone of our national liberties, and on the broadest arch of our national power.” “Splendid as were the incidents of Chancellor Livingston’s official and political career, he himself wisely looked with more satisfaction, and his best fame may hereafter rest, upon his efficient agency as an enlightened private citizen in hastening forward the march of improve- ment over our land. He was among the first in this State who applied to agriculture the science and the interest of a liberal study. ... The arts of taste and design found in him one of their earliest and most judi- cious patrons. Under his auspices the first academy in this country for their cultivation was formed, and under his immediate direction it was provided with the best means of improvement for the artist, and of instruction and refinement to the general taste. Above all, his agency in the invention of steam-navigation, his enlightened science in perceiving its practicability and admirable use, his prophetic confidence in the ultimate success amidst repeated disappointments, losses and ridicule, and finally 
his sagacity in seizing upon and associating with himself the practical genius of Fulton, whose plans had been re- jected with scorn by the rulers, the savans, and the capi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-86

1776 talists of the old world, combine to place him in the 
highest ranks of the lasting benefactors of the human 
race. It is a beautiful thought of Lord Bacon’s, that 
antiquity, which honoured the law-givers, the founders or 
deliverers of states, but with the titles of worthies or demi- 
gods, rightly bestowed upon those who had invented or 
improved the arts and commodities of human life ‘ honours 
(as he terms them) heroical and divine’; because the 
merit of the former is confined within the circle of one 
age or nation, but that of the others is indeed like the 
benefits of heaven, being permanent and universal... . 
It was therefore a proud eulogy as well as a true one, 
which a distinguished Professor lately pronounced upon 
this College, when he traced to her walls and lecture- 
rooms, the germs of the greatest practical improvements 
which science has bestowed upon our state and nation — 
the steam-navigation of Livingston and Stevens, and the 
canal system of Morris and Clinton.”

COLUMBIA COLLEGE UNDER THE REGENTS OF THE 
UNIVERSITY OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK 
Wuen the independence of the United States had been 
confirmed by the treaty of peace with Great Britain in 
1783 —in the negotiation of which treaty a son of King’s 
College, John Jay, of the class of ’64, is said to have been 
so influential that it was “not only chiefly, but wholly 
by his means that it was brought to a successful conclu- 
sion” —the attention of the Legislature of New York 
was directed to the necessity of providing education for 
the people as a means of ennobling and making perma- 
nent the liberty that had been secured. King’s College 
had suffered severe losses during the war and had remained 
practically in abeyance for eight years. Numerous vacan- 
cies had occurred in the Board of Governors by the death 
or absence of many of its members, and the interposition 
of the Legislature had become necessary to restore the 
vitality of the Corporation. Accordingly, the surviving 
and present remnant of the body of Governors petitioned 
the Legislature to erect the College into a University, and 
to make such alterations in the Charter as the changed 
condition of affairs might demand. 
Moved by this petition, the Legislature of the State of 
New York passed, May 1, 1784, “An Act for granting 
certain privileges to the College heretofore called King’s 
College, for altering the name and Charter thereof, and 
erecting an University within this State.” By this Act 
was created a “body corporate and politic” styled the 
59

60 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1784 “ Regents of the University of the State of New York, of 
whom the Governor, the Lieutenant-Governor, the Presi- 
dent of the Senate for the time being, the Speaker of the 
Assembly, the Mayor of the City of Albany, the Attorney- 
General and the Secretary of the State respectively for 
the time being” were constituted Regents by reason of 
their offices, together with twenty-four gentlemen desig- 
nated by name, and representatives of the “respective re- 
ligious denominations in this State” to be chosen by the 
clergy thereof. 
The Regents were given 
“full power and authority to ordain and make ordinances 
and bye laws for the government of the several Colleges 
which may or shall compose the said University” created 
by the Act ; were “impowered to found Schools and Col- 
leges in any such part of the State as may seem expedient 
to them and to endow the same, vesting such Colleges so 
endowed with full and ample powers to confer the degree 
of Batchelor of Arts, and directing the manner in which 
such Colleges are to be governed, always reserving, . . . 
a right to visit and examine into the state of literature in 
such College; . . . every such School or College being at 
all times to be deemed a part of the University” ; were 
vested with “all the rights, privileges and immunities here- 
tofore vested in the Corporation” of King’s College, and 
were endowed with all the estate, real and personal, of 
that Corporation to be held and “applied solely to the 
use of the said College”; were “further impowered and 
directed as soon as may be to elect a President and Pro- 
fessors for the College heretofore called King’s College, 
which President shall continue in place during the pleasure 
of the Regents of the University,” and were instructed 
“that from and after the first election the said President 
and all future Presidents shall be elected from out of the 
Professors of the several Colleges, that may or shall com- 
pose the said University, and that no Professor shall in any 
way whatsoever be accounted ineligible, for or by reason 
of any religious tenet or tenets that he may or shall pro- 
fess, or be compelled by any bye law or otherwise to take 
any religious test-oath whatsoever.” The Act further

ordained “that the College within the City of New York 1784 
heretofore called King’s College be forever hereafter 
called and known by the name of Columbia College.” 
Mr. George H. Moore in his Origin and Early History 
of Columbia College remarks that King’s College emerged 
from the Revolution “ with the new name of Columbia, 
a word and name then for the first time recognized any- 
where in law and history.” 
The Regents of the University held their first meeting 
on the third day after their appointment, at the house of 
John Simmons, an innkeeper in Wall Street, New York 
City, but there being no quorum present they adjourned 
to the following day. On May 5 a quorum being pres- 
ent, Governor George Clinton was elected Chancellor of 
the University ; Lieutenant-Governor Pierre Van Cort- 
landt, Vice-Chancellor; Brockholst Livingston, Treas- 
urer; and Robert Harpur, Secretary. The Treasurer 
and the Secretary were instructed to “ demand and receive 
from the late Treasurer and Clerk of the late corporation 
of the College called King’s College, and from any other 
person or persons” all records, books and papers and all 
property of whatever kind, “lately belonging to the said 
late Corporation,” and “in case of refusal to deliver the 
same to commence suits for the recovery thereof.” The 
election of a President of the College was considered and 
postponed. The Rev. John Peter Tetard, who had taught 
a French school in New York before the Revolution and 
had been, by appointment of the New York Provincial 
Congress in 1775, French interpreter to General Schuyler 
and “ Chaplin for the Troops of this Colony,” was elected 
Professor of the French Language. Committees were 
appointed to supervise the repairs of the College building, 
to report by-laws, to devise a proper seal, to take meas- 
ures for the recovery of moneys due the College on bonds, 
mortgages, leases or otherwise, and to engage instructors 
“for the term of twelve months.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
62 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1784 On the 15th of May a Grammar School was insti- 
tuted with William Cochran, who had been educated at 
Trinity College, Dublin, as Headmaster, “ with permission 
to remove his present school thither.” Mr. Cochran was 
made also temporary instructor, in the College, of the 
Greek and Latin Languages, to the Professorship of which 
he was appointed in the following December. 
On the same day, May 15, the examination of candi- 
dates for admission to the College, and their admission, 
was intrusted to a committee consisting of the ‘ Chan- 
cellor or Vice-Chancellor and any two of the Regents,” 
with Professor Tetard and Mr. Cochran; and each year, 
during the control of the Regents, a similar committee 
was appointed for the like purpose. 
Two days later De Witt Clinton entered the Junior 
Class, the first student of the College under its new name. 
“It was, I may say, a mere accident,” wrote Professor 
Cochran many years later to Dr. David Hosack, “that 
either that Seminary or myself has had any share in edu- 
cating so great and useful a man. In the summer of 1784, 
his father brought him to New York, on his way to Prince- 
ton College, to place him in that Seminary. The Legis- 
lature had passed an act in the preceding winter, for 
restoring and new naming King’s College; afterwards to 
be a University by the name of Columbia. But no final 
arrangements or appointments had been made ; only a 
committee was impowered to provide, in a temporary way, 
for what might be most needful. The late Mr. Duane, 
then Mayor of New York, was one of the committee, who 
hearing that the nephew of the Governor was going out 
of the State for his education, applied to me, to know if 
I would undertake the care of him, and such others as 
might offer, until the appointments for the College could 
be made. To which I readily agreed, and young Clinton 
with half a dozen more, were put under my tuition.” 1

-P-A-G-E-93
COLUMBIA COLLEGE UNDER THE REGENTS 63 
During 1784 nine students were admitted, all to the 1784 
Junior Class. 
Colonel Matthew Clarkson was appointed and author- 
ized, at a meeting held May 26, to proceed to France 
and the United Netherlands to solicit and receive bene- 
factions for the use of the University, and was instructed 
to “purchase such philosophical apparatus for the College 
as Dr. Franklin, Mr. Adams and Mr. Jefferson, Ministers 
of the United States, should advise.” 
The Regents soon became convinced that the Act con- 
stituting them was defective, by reason of “ the dispersed 
residences of many of the Regents,” “the largeness of the 
quorum who are made capable of business,” and certain 
obscurities giving rise to doubts as to the construction of 
the Act. They submitted the matter to the Legislature, 
and the Legislature, on November 26, 1784, passed an 
amendatory Act, appointing additional Regents, reducing 
the quorum, and providing for meetings. The Act also 
authorized the Treasurer of the State to advance the sum 
of £2552 to the Treasurer of the University for the use 
of Columbia College. 
Dr. Rodgers, Colonel Hamilton, and Dr. McKnight 
were, on November 26, appointed a committee “to pre- 
pare and report a plan for a subscription to be opened in 
the State for the benefit of the University, with an ad- 
dress to the citizens on that subject.” At the same meet- 
ing a committee, of which Mayor Duane and Colonel 
Hamilton were members, was requested “to report the 
plan of education for the present, and the number of 
officers necessary to carry it into execution.” 
At a meeting held December 14, 1784, a committee, 
previously appointed, reported that “the annual income 
of Columbia College was computed to be £1000” ; recom- 
mended the establishment of seven Professorships and 
nine “extra Professorships” in the Faculty of Arts, eight 
Professorships in the Faculty of Medicine, three Professor- 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
   64 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1784 ships in the Faculty of Law, Professorships in the Law of 
   Nature and Nations, in the Roman Civil Law and Mu- 
nicipal Law, the Oriental Languages, in German, in Low 
Dutch, in Civil History, in Architecture, in Commerce, 
in Agriculture, in Music, and in Painting, and that a 
“Faculty of Divinity be formed by such Professorships 
as may be established by the different Religious Societies 
within the State.” The committee further recommended 
that a President, a Secretary, and a Librarian be appointed ; 
“that the different Professorships in the Faculty of Arts 
be completed as soon as possible, and that the following 
salaries be annexed to each Professorship independent of 
the Emoluments of the Classes, viz.: Latin, Greek, Moral 
Philosophy, each £100 per annum — Rhetoric and Logic 
£50 — Mathematics, Natural Philosophy and Astronomy, 
each £200—and that the Professor of the French Lan- 
guage already appointed be allowed £100 per annum — 
and that the annual salary of the President, as such, be 
£200.” 
The Professorships that were filled were the following: 
In the Faculty of Arts: Latin, William Cochran, and 
Greek, the same; Rhetoric, Rev. Benjamin Moore, of the 
class of ’68; Geography, Rev. John D. Gross, §.T.D.; 
Natural Philosophy and Astronomy, Dr. Samuel Bard, of 
the class of ’63; and the following “extra Professor- 
ships” distinguished, apparently, from ‘ Professorships ” 
by having no salary attached to them, viz.: Oriental Lan- 
guages, Rev. Johann C. Kunze, 8.T.D.; German Lan- 
guage, Rev. Dr. Gross. In the Faculty of Medicine : 
Chemistry, Dr. Samuel Bard, who resigned early in 1785, 
to become Professor of Natural Philosophy and Astron- 
omy and was succeeded by Henry Moyes, LL.D. ; Natural 
History, Dr. Moyes ; Institute of Medicine, Dr. Benjamin 
Kissam ; Anatomy, Dr. Charles McKnight, and Surgery, 
the same ; Midwifery, Dr. Ebenezer Crosby; Practice of 
Physic, Dr. Nicholas Romayne. 
On the 4th of April, 1785, a committee appointed to 
examine the state of funds of the College and “to enquire   
 
-P-A-G-E-95
COLUMBIA COLLEGE UNDER THE REGENTS 65 
for a proper person to be appointed President and Pro- 1785 
fessor of Mathematics” reported that there were in the 
hands of the Treasurer £952, and in the hands of Mr. 
Cotes of London, subject to the draft of the Treasurer, 
£1169 14s. 6d.; that the College lots, if let out to the 
best advantage, would bring in about £250 per annum ; 
that if all debts due to the College were prosecuted to a 
settlement, ‘a sum not less than £12000 might be secured, 
the income of which at seven per cent. will be £840 ;” 
«that the rent of the rooms, over and above what will be 
necessary for the accommodation of the President and 
Professors, at 80s. per annum for each student will be 
£120;” and they hope therefore “the future income of 
Columbia College may be estimated at £1200 per annum.” 
They further reported “ that from the deranged state of 
and great losses which the funds of Columbia College 
have sustained, they do not think the Regency have it at 
present in their power to offer such a salary as will be an 
inducement to a respectable character to accept the office 
of President”; that they had arranged with the Profes- 
sors in the Faculty of Arts to “execute the office of Presi- 
dent for one year by monthly rotation,” and had appointed 
Mr. John Kemp to be teacher of Mathematics for one 
year with the salary attached to the Professorship. They 
advised the Regents that the plan of tuition and disci- 
pline should be published and to it annexed an address 
to the public “explanatory of their Institution, represent- 
ing the losses of Columbia College and the deranged state 
of its funds, and requesting the aid of the public by volun- 
tary subscriptions to carry their plan into full execution,” 
and that “an application be made to the Legislature to 
grant them an aid by a tax on marriage licenses or any 
other mode they may think proper.” 
Tt does not appear that the plans of the Regents for 
obtaining financial aid by voluntary subscription or leg- 
islative grant were successful. The only recorded bene-

1786 faction is a bequest, left by Major Edward Clarke in 1785, of £1000 sterling to be expended in the purchase of books for the College Library. 
Two classes were graduated under the auspices of the Regents—the class of ’86 and that of ’87. A com- mittee of the Regents, especially appointed for the pur- pose, superintended these Commencements, and presented each student, admissible to the degree of Bachelor of Arts, instead of a diploma, “ with a certificate under the seal of the corporation signed by the Secretary, certifying that he is entitled to the degree of Batchelor of Arts to be conferred as soon as a President shall be appointed for Columbia College.” The certificates then given were, in 1788, replaced by diplomas in due form, bearing date, respectively, April 4, 1786, and April 5, 1787. 
The following is an account of the first Commence- 
ment of Columbia College under its new name given in the Mew York Journal or Weekly Register for April 13, 1786: — 
“On Tuesday last (11th) was held the first Commence- ment of Columbia College: and the public, with equal surprise and pleasure, received the first fruits of reviving learning, after a lamented interval of many years. “The Honorable the Continental Congress, and both Houses of the Legislature suspended the public business, to support the important interests of Education by their countenance, and grace the ceremony by their august pres- ence. The procession moved from College Hall about an half an hour after eleven in the forenoon, in the fol- lowing order: [The order is then given.] “When they arrived at St. Paul’s Church, the place appointed for their graduation, the Reverend Mr. Pro- voost introduced the solemnity of the day by performing Divine Service. 
“Mr. Cochran, Professor of the Greek and Latin Lan- guages, was appointed to call up the speakers in their proper order. 
“Mr. De Witt Clinton, the first candidate who spoke, 
 
-P-A-G-E-97
COLUMBIA COLLEGE UNDER THE REGENTS 67 
addressed the audience in an elegant Latin oration, De 1787 
utilitate et necessitate studiorum artium liberalium, which 
he finished with a polite and well adapted salutation, in 
the same language, to the Members of Congress and of 
the Legislature ; to the Regents and Professors, and to the 
audience at large.” 
A list of other speakers follows, and the whole con- 
cludes : — 
“We do not remember ever to have seen such a con- 
course of people as met upon this auspicious occasion, who 
seemed universally delighted with the performance of the 
candidates, equally honorable to the teachers and them- 
selves.” 
The Regents found by experience that the amendatory 
act of November 26, 1784, had not overcome the difficulties 
under which they labored in the administration of their 
trust. In April, 1786, a committee was appointed to con- 
sider the matter and report measures of relief. Again, 
in January, 1787, a committee, of which Mayor Duane 
was chairman, was instructed “to take into consideration 
the present state of the University and to report as soon 
as possible the measures necessary to be adopted to carry 
into effect the views of the Legislature with respect to 
the same and particularly with respect to Columbia 
College.” This committee, on the 15th of February, 
reported, among other things, “ That each respective 
College ought to be entrusted to a distinct corporation 
with competent powers and privileges,” and submitted the 
draft of a bill for effecting the changes suggested in the 
report. This draft was referred, on March 8, to a com- 
mittee consisting, among others, of the Speaker of the 
Assembly, the Mayor of New York, John Jay and Alex- 
ander Hamilton, “to consider of the most proper means 
for procuring an Act of the Legislature for amending 
the Charter of the University, either in conformity to the 
bill directed to be presented by the resolution of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-98
68 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1787 Board of the fifteenth of February last or with such alter- 
ations as may be found necessary.” This committee pre- 
pared a bill for submission to the Legislature, and the 
Legislature, on the 13th of April, 1787, passed “ An Act 
to institute an University within this State and for other 
purposes therein mentioned.” 
The Act provides for the establishment of a University 
to be called and known by the name or style of “The 
Regents of the University of the State of New York” 
and creates the Regents a corporation, with power to visit

and to grant charters ; revives and confirms the original 
Charter of King’s College with amendments abolishing ex 
officio membership of its governing body, cancelling the 
requirements that the President should hold a certain 
form of religious belief, and that a certain form of prayer 
should be used in the morning and evening services of the 
College ; ordains that the College “shall be henceforth 
called Columbia College” and “ that the style of the said 
corporation shall be the Trustees of Columbia College

Trustees and vests in them “all and singular the power, 
authority, rights, privileges, franchises and immunities,” 
“excepting as before excepted,” and “all and singular the 
lands, tenements, hereditaments and real estate, goods, 
chattels, rents, annuities, moneys, books and other prop- 
erty,” whereof the Governors of King’s College were 
possessed or entitled by virtue of the original Charter, or 
with which the Regents of the University were invested by 
the Acts of 1784 for the benefit of Columbia College. The 
body of Trustees named in the Act, after it became reduced 
to twenty-four “by the death or resignation or removal of 
any ” of its members, was made a self-perpetuating body. 
Under this government the College has since remained.

1787-1800 
PRESIDENT WILLIAM SAMUEL JOHNSON 
Tue Trustees named in the Act met at the Exchange 
in the city of New York on Tuesday, May 8, 1787, with 
the Hon. James Duane, as Chairman, and completed their 
organization by the election of Robert Harpur, as Secre- 
tary, and Brockholst Livingston, as Treasurer. Mr. Har- 
pur had been Professor in King’s College, 1761-1767 ; Mr. 
Livingston, who served the College well as Trustee and 
Treasurer from its reorganization in 1784, till his death 
in 1823, and was for the last seven years of his life 
Chairman of the Trustees, was the son of William Living- 
ston who so bitterly opposed the granting of a Charter to 
King’s College in 1754. 
During the month of May, Professors Kunze, Bard, and 
Romayne resigned their offices, so that there were, practi- 
cally, when the Trustees assumed charge — in the Faculty 
of Medicine, three Professors: Dr. McKnight, Anatomy 
and Surgery ; Dr. Crosby, Midwifery ; Dr. Kissam, In- 
stitutes of Medicine—in the Faculty of Arts, three 
Professors : Mr. Cochran, Greek and Latin Languages ; 
Dr. Kemp, Mathematics ; Rev. Dr. Gross, Geography and 
German. Of Dr. Gross’s instruction in Geography the 
following notice is interesting : — 
“ After the Revolution, Columbia College, having 
dropped its royal name and patron as well as its Tory 
President and Tory Professor of History, took a fresh 
start under American auspices. An old broadside, pre- 
served in the Columbia Library, contains the statutes 
of the College for 1785, and a ‘Plan of Education,’

  70 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1787 whereby it.appears that history was taught in what was 
then a unique way for America. The Rev. John Daniel 
Gross, Professor of German and Geography, from 1784 to 
1795, taught the Sophomore Class three times a week, in 
a course which was characterized as a ‘ Description of the 
Globe in respect of all general matters. Rise, extent, and 
fall of ancient empires ; chronology as low as the fall of 
the Roman Empire ; present state of the world ; origin of 
the present States and Kingdoms — their extent, power, 
commerce, religion, and customs ; modern chronology.’ 
This was history with an ancient and geographical basis, 
but with a modern political outlook. It was a highly 
creditable course, the best that the writer has found in the 
annals of any American College, at that early period. It 
savors, however, more of German than of English origin. 
John Gross, Professor of German and Geography, and 
afterward of Moral Philosophy, evidently represents a 
European current in American College instruction. He 
was the forerunner of Francis Lieber, the German 
American.” 1! 
On the 21st of May, William Samuel Johnson, LL.D., 
was unanimously elected President of Columbia College, 
and on the 12th of November following signified his ac- 
ceptance. 
Dr. Johnson was the son of the Rey. Dr. Samuel John- 
son, first President of King’s College. He was graduated 
Bachelor of Arts from Yale College in 1744, and received 
from Harvard, three years later, the degree of Master of 
Arts. He was bred to the law and early achieved a com- 
manding position in the profession. He repeatedly 
represented his county in the Colonial Assembly of Con- 
necticut, and in 1765 was a delegate from Connecticut 
to a Congress of Colonies held in New York. He 
was, in 1766, selected as special agent of Connecticut 
to the Court of Great Britain to manage a case of great 
importance, involving title to a large tract of land and

PRESIDENT WILLIAM SAMUEL JOHNSON yer 
“even the chartered rights” of the Province. He spent 1787 
nearly five years in this enterprise. While in England he 
enjoyed the companionship and friendship of some of the 
foremost men of the time — among others, of Archbishop 
Secker of Canterbury, of Lord Mansfield, and of the great 
lexicographer, Samuel Johnson, who wrote him a letter, 
under date of March 4, 1773, beginning, “Of all those 
whom the various accidents of life have brought within 
my notice, there is scarce any man whose acquaintance 
I have more desired to cultivate than yours.” After his 
return he filled, successively, the offices of Judge of the 
Superior Court of Connecticut, member of the Council of 
Connecticut, Representative in Congress, in which office 
he continued till he was chosen a delegate to the Conven- 
tion which framed the Constitution of the United States. 
Not long after his acceptance of the presidency of Co- 
lumbia College, in January, 1788, he was chosen United 
States Senator from Connecticut under the new Consti- 
tution. “To him and his colleague, Oliver Ellsworth, 
was committed the important duty of framing a judiciary 
system for the United States, and the bill which they 
reported was adopted with little alteration.” He com- 
bined the duties of the presidency and the senatorship 
till the sittings of Congress were removed from New 
York to Philadelphia, when he resigned the senatorship.? 
He continued President of the College till 1800, and con- 
ducted the office with dignity, usefulness, and honor. 
From the report of a committee on the state of the 
College made November 26, 1787, it appears that — 
twenty-four of the twenty-nine gentlemen named as 
Trustees in the Act of 1787 accepted the office: Dr. 
Johnson as President received a salary of £400; Dr. 
Gross received no salary as Professor of German and 
Geography, but as temporary instructor of Moral Philos-

Johnson.

  72 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1787 ophy he received £50; Mr. Cochran received £100 as 
Professor of Latin and £100 as Professor of Greek; 
Dr. Kemp received £200 as Professor of Mathematics 
and £50 additional as temporary instructor in Natural 
Philosophy. These salaries with payments to the steward 
and other under offices amounted to £972 per annum. | 
The Professors in the Faculty of Medicine received no 
salaries. The number of students was 39, distributed 
as follows: Freshmen 18; Sophomores 7; Juniors 10; 
Seniors 4; of whom five slept and boarded in the College | 
building, and 34 in the City. The President, Professors, | 
and students wore no gowns. There were no suitable 
apartments for the use of the classes. The tuition money 
and chamber rent were not ascertained further than that 
neither should exceed that paid for a like purpose by the | 
College of New Jersey. There was scarcely any library. | 
The College had property consisting of 91 lots, of which | 
78 were rented on leases for £447 11s. per annum; bonds | 
reckoned good to the amount of £12,633 10s. 8d., on which 
the annual interest was £880 6s. 2d., and the amount of 
interest due was £2345 8s.; bonds reckoned bad to the 
amount of £2304, on which there was interest due 
amounting to £1885 9s. Td. The whole annual income 
of the College was £1331 17s. 2d., and the amount then 
in the hands of the Treasurer was £614 8s. 6d. At 
several successive meetings in the month of December, it 
was determined that President Johnson should give in- 
struction in Rhetoric and Logic (in which department 
there was no Professor), and that he should receive £50 | 
per annum for the service; that the President and the 
Professors should be recommended to wear gowns; that 
the Professors be requested to attend prayers punctually 
in the College Hall; that each student should pay the | 
President and each Professor or teacher whose course 
he attended $5 per annum; that the Treasurer should 
receive £30 per annum and the Secretary £25; and
-P-A-G-E-105
PRESIDENT WILLIAM SAMUEL JOHNSON 73 
that the Statutes should be revised. Professor Gross was 1789 
made Professor of Moral Philosophy, which subject he 
had taught as temporary instructor from his first connec- 
tion with the college. 
In 1788, the students were allowed, on their own peti- 
tion, to wear gowns, and in the following year the Presi- 
dent and Professors were authorized to require them to 
wear gowns “in such cases and under such penalties as 
they may judge proper.” 
It may be of interest to note here, that, of the students 
entering the freshman class in 1788 were John Randolph, 
afterward celebrated as of Roanoke, and his brother The- 
odoric. It appears from the Matricula that both were pro- 
moted to the sophomore class in 1789, and that John 
became a member of the junior class in 1790 but left 
some time during that year. 
On April 9, 1789, Peter Wilson was elected Professor 
of the Latin and Greek Languages, in place of Mr. Cochran 
who had resigned. ‘The Professor of Mathematics and 
Natural Philosophy was authorized to give instruction to 
the students in the manner proposed by him in the follow- 
ing plan: — 
Fresuman Crass.— Twice a Week.— Extraction of the 
Roots; Algebra as far as Cubic Equations. 
SopHomore Crass. — Three times a Week. —Euclid’s Ele- 
ments; Plain Trigonometry, its application to the mensuration 
of heights and distances, of surfaces and solids; Land survey- 
ing; Navigation, etc. 
Juntor Crass.— Once a Day.— Conic Sections and other 
Curves; Projection of the Sphere ; Spherical Trigonometry, its 
application to Astronomy; the higher parts of Algebra; the 
application of Algebra to Geometry; General Principles of 
Fluxions. 
Senior Crass. — Once a Day. — General properties of Mat- 
ter; Laws of Motion; Mechanical Powers; Construction of 
Machines; Hydrostatics; Hydraulics; Pneumatics; Optics; 
Astronomy; Electricity and Magnetism.

T4 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1789 On the 30th of April, 1789, the Hon. Robert R. Liv- 
ingston, class of ’65, King’s College, Chancellor of the 
State of New York, administered the oath of office to, 
and proclaimed, George Washington President of the 
United States of America. The spot on which this cere- 
mony took place is marked by a statue of Washington in 
front of the United States Sub-Treasury in Wall Street, 
New York. The President, the Vice-President, and the 
Houses of Congress then proceeded to St. Paul’s Chapel, 
where divine service was performed by the Right Rev. 
Dr. Provoost, class of ’58, King’s College, Bishop of 
New York and Chaplain to the Senate. On the 6th 
of May following was held, in St. Paul’s Chapel, the 
Annual Commencement of Columbia College, which was 
graced by the presence of President Washington, Vice- 
President Adams, the Senate and House of Representatives 
of the United States, and of the Governor and principal 
officers of the State of New York. The College had, 
through its alumni, been of signal service in bringing about 
the independence of the country and the establishment of 
its government upon a sure constitutional foundation, and 
one of the earliest acts of the new government was this 
tribute of honor to the College. 
In the latter part of April, 1791, the Trustees appointed 
a committee to prepare a plan for teaching in the College 
the science of medicine, and to report it without delay. 
Soon afterward, on May 2, the Committee reported that 
it would be “ proper at present to have Lectures in Chem- 
istry, Anatomy and the Practice of Physic read in Colum- 
bia College and that Dr. Romayne (who already has a 
very considerable number of pupils under his tuition and 
has been in the habit of teaching) be nominated Lecturer 
in those Branches.” Dr. Romayne was, on May 5, 
appointed Lecturer. 
The Trustees proceeded steadily in their endeavors to 
rehabilitate the College and make the course of instruction

as complete as possible. They were encouraged by the 1792 
favor of the Legislature and aided by grants of money for 
the purchase of books and scientific apparatus, for build- 
ings, and the salaries of Professors. By “an Act for the 
further encouragement of Literature” passed March 31, 
1790, the Legislature authorized and empowered the Re- 
gents of the University to take possession of certain lands 
and tenements and apply the revenue from them for the 
better advancement of science and literature in Columbia 
College and the Academies incorporated or to be incor- 
porated by the Regents; and, further, granted for imme- 
diate use the sum of £1000. One moiety of the sum 
appropriated was devoted to the use of the College to 
relieve its more pressing necessities. 
“An Act to encourage Literature, by Donations to Co- 
lumbia College and to the several Academies in the State,” 
passed April 11, 1792, granted to the Trustees of the Col- 
lege: £1500 to enlarge the Library; £200 for a chemical 
apparatus; £1200 to build a wall to support the grounds 
of the College; £5000 to erect a hall and an additional 
wing pursuant to the original plan of the College; £750 
annually for five years for salaries of additional Professors, 
which annuity was continued for two years longer (seven 
years in all) by an Act passed April 17, 1796. 
In June, 1792, a committee of the Trustees, appointed in 
the preceding April “to see what additional Professorships 
are wanting in this College and what salaries can be al- 
lowed for their support,” reported that there were needed 
the following Professorships: Law; Ancient and Modern 
History; Natural History, Chemistry, Agriculture and 
other Arts depending thereon, annual salary £200; Ori- 
ental Languages, salary £100; French Language, salary 
£100. 
The report was agreed to, and it was resolved that the 
Professor of Oriental Languages should be at liberty to 
instruct his students but three days in the week and at his

1792 own house, for which he be entitled to receive from each 
student “the usual fees of forty shillings per annum”; 
that the Professor of French should “teach such of the 
students of the College as choose to be instructed in that 
Language” at such times as might be agreed upon by the 
Board of President and Professors, the fee for each stu- 
dent to be forty shillings; that the Professor of Natural 
History, etc., should, during the sessions of the College, 
daily attend his Lectures there, Saturdays excepted, the 
fee to the Professor from each student to be forty shillings 
per annum. “The schedule or sketch of this Professorship 
(Natural History, etc.) to comprehend the Philosophical 
Doctrines of Chemistry and Natural History under the 
following Heads: 1. Geology, or the natural and chemi- 
cal History of the Earth; 2. Meteorology, or the natural 
and chemical History of the Atmosphere; 3. Hydrology, 
or the natural and chemical History of Waters; 4. Min- 
eralogy, or the natural and chemical History of Fossil 
Substances; 5. Botany, or the natural and chemical His- 
tory of Plants; 6. Zodlogy, or the natural and chemical 
History of Animals. The course to be so arranged with 
the Professor of Mathematics and Mechanical Philosophy 
as to form a complete set of doctrines and facts in the 
department of experimental Physics.” 
At the next meeting of the Trustees, July 9, three of 
the Professorships were filled by the election of Dr. Sam- 
uel Latham Mitchill, Natural History, etc.; Rev. Dr.Johann 
C. Kunze, Oriental Languages, and Mr. Villette de Mar- 
cellin, French Language. At this meeting it was “ Or- 
dered that every Professor of this College who teaches by 
Lecture do publish within one year a Syllabus of his 
Course of Lectures — and that such as teach by recitation 
and examination publish a plan of their courses, both to 
be so constructed as to point out the Time employed and 
number of Lectures given in each.” 
In December of the following year, the Professorship  
-P-A-G-E-111
  . 
PRESIDENT WILLIAM SAMUEL JOHNSON 17 
of Law was filled by the election of James Kent, subse- 1794 
quently the celebrated Chancellor of New York, whose 
appointment was the forerunner of the Law School. 
In July, 1794, Professor Mitchill, on behalf of a com- 
mittee appointed for the purpose, made report to the 
Senatus Academicus of “the present state of Learning in 
the College, collected from written statements handed in 
by the Professors.” This report was sent to the Regents 
of the University, and by them submitted to the Legisla- 
ture with their report made in 1795. (A copy of the 
pamphlet is in the Library of the University.) 
The presentation begins with the statement “The 
College consists of two Faculties; 1. The Faculty of 
Arts, composed of the President and seven Professors ; 
and, 2. The Faculty of Physic, comprehending the Dean 
and seven other Professors.” The plan of instruction 
follows :— 
President Johnson was Lecturer in Rhetoric and Belles- 
lettres, and instructed the students in the grammar and 
proper pronunciation of the English Language. He so 
conducted his course “as to comprehend, as far as possible, 
a complete course of instruction in the Origin, Nature 
and Progress of Language in general, and of the English 
Language in particular; in the art of writing and speak- 
ing it with propriety, elegance, and force — the rules and 
principles of every species of eloquence —the principles 
of true taste and the rules of just criticism, whereby the 
students may be enabled to judge properly of each species 
of composition in every branch of elegant literature.” 
Professor Gross taught Moral Philosophy. ‘“ The sys- 
tem of that science in Columbia College comprehends an 
Introductory Treatise on the different states and condi- 
tions of man—the nature of man—the powers and 
faculties of the human mind which distinguish him from 
the rest of animated nature on earth; as a moral agent 
accountable to God and his fellow-creatures for his actions 
Na a i De
-P-A-G-E-112
78 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1794 and the use of those powers. — Then follows a threefold 
division of the course: 1. The first explaining the Prin- 
ciples and Laws resulting from the nature of man, and 
his natural relations to God and his fellow-creatures, by 
which human conduct ought to be regulated in a manner 
becoming the dignity of human nature, and conformable 
to the will of God. This constitutes the ‘ Law of Nature’ 
strictly so called.” “2. In the second part of the system, 
those general principles are applied to the different states, 
relations, and conditions of man, comprehending (a) ethics. 
- +. (6) Natural Jurisprudence.” Rights in Things; 
Rights of Persons; Civil Government. “38. The Law 
of Nations, as founded in nature, makes the third part.” 
John Kemp, LL.D., was Professor of Mathematics. 
The course given by him was fairly extensive, embracing 
Arithmetic taught “in a scientific manner,” Algebra in- 
cluding the higher branches, Trigonometry, Land Sur- 
veying and Navigation, Euclid, the doctrine of chances 
and annuities, application of Algebra to Geometry, and 
the Doctrine of Fluxions. 
“There is also a Professorship of Natural Philosophy 
and Astronomy in the College. This course is divided, 
by John Kemp, LL.D., the Professor, into, 1. Mechan- 
ies, strictly so called; 2. Hydrostatics; 3. Hydraulics ; 
4. Pneumatics; 5. Optics; 6. Electricity; 7. Magnetism ; 
and, 8. Astronomy.” 
“The College is provided with an elegant and exten- 
sive apparatus for Mechanical Philosophy and Astronomy. 
There are about six hundred experiments performed each 
year during the course. — Young gentlemen may attend 
any or all of the Mathematical classes, as well as the 
Natural Philosophy and Astronomical class, without regu- 
larly entering the College, or being subjected to any 
other regulations of the College than relate to those 
classes respectively.” 
The Rey. Elijah D. Rattoone was Professor of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-113
PRESIDENT WILLIAM SAMUEL JOHNSON 79 
Greek and Latin Languages, in which a thorough and 1794 
extended course was given. Mr. Rattoone also filled the 
Professorship of Humanity, which was established May 7, 
1794. In this subject he delivered a regular course of 
lectures on “ Humanity; including the opinions of the 
ancient philosophers; the religion, government, laws, 
policy, customs, and manners of Greece and Rome: the 
whole designed to explain and elucidate ancient learning, 
and to facilitate the acquisition of liberal knowledge. 
“In short, the object pursued is to make critical and 
useful scholars — to infuse, from those learned languages, 
a true taste for propriety and correctness —to teach the 
value of those tongues which never change nor vary, 
which the Professor considers as the true standards of 
excellence in language, and as containing generally what- 
ever is just in thought, elegant in expression, and har- 
monious in numbers.” 
“John Christoff Kunze, §.T.D., is the Professor of 
Oriental Languages, and assists the Students of Divinity, 
of all denominations, in their pursuits to acquire a com- 
petent knowledge of the original language of such docu- 
ments of revealed religion as belong to the Old Testament. 
He teaches the graduates and undergraduates of Columbia 
College, and others who apply for the purpose, at such 
hours as do not interfere with the usual lecture hours 
of College.” “As he found it difficult to procure a 
printed grammar in sufficient numbers in this country, 
and the use of different grammars would retard the prog- 
ress of the students, he has brought all that is necessary 
and essential into the small compass of four sheets, of 
which each of his hearers, by degrees, takes a copy; and 
he flatters himself, that his method hitherto has proved 
more compendious and more advantageous than that 
generally pursued. Only a few of the principal rules are 
to be gotten by heart, and the rest are rendered familiar 
by the practice.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
80 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1792 “A Professorship of Economics was instituted in July, 
1792, and Samuel Latham Mitchill, M.D., appointed 
Professor. This course, of which a Syllabus is published, 
is conducted upon the new French system. A few weeks 
ago, Mr. Mitchill gave an edition of the New Nomencla- 
ture of Chemistry, in French, German and English, for 
the use of the students. This Professorship comprises 
not only the classification and arrangement of natural 
bodies, but also treats of a great variety of facts which 
form the basis of Medicine, Agriculture, and other useful 
arts, as well as of manufactures.” 
Any gentleman might attend the class in Chemistry, 
without regularly attending College; and there was said 
to be “a handsome apparatus belonging to this depart- 
ment and a considerable collection of fossils.” 
“The Professorship of the French Tongue” was held 
by Antoine Villette Marcellin. His courses, though 
particularly intended for the College students, were open 
to other persons. 
“A Professorship of Law was instituted in December, 
1793, and James Kent, A.M., appointed Professor. Mr. 
Kent having been so recently appointed, has not as yet 
entered upon a course of lectures. . . .” 
Encouraged by the appropriations referred to as made 
by the Legislature, the Trustees continued the appoint- 
ment of additional Professors by the election, in 1795, of 
the Rey. Dr. John McKnight as Professor of Moral Phi- 
losophy (Dr. Gross had resigned) and Logic, and of the 
Rey. Mr. John Bisset, Professor of Rhetoric and Belles- 
lettres. They also proceeded with the building of an 
additional wing as provided for in the Act of 1792. They 
found, however, that their plans were more extensive 
than their means would allow, and in 1796, having failed 
in their application to the Legislature for additional aid, 
they were obliged to suspend their building operations. 
In 1797 the Legislature granted $500 for the preservation 
 
-P-A-G-E-115
PRESIDENT WILLIAM SAMUEL JOHNSON 81 
and care of the Anatomical Museum. In 1799 the 1800 
annual grant by the State of £750, for the payment of 
salaries, expiring by limitation, the Trustees committed 
the teaching of Rhetoric and Belles-lettres, with Logic 
and Moral Philosophy, to the President ; united in one 
Professorship the Latin and Greek Languages, Roman 
and Grecian Antiquities ; combined in another, Mathe- 
matics, Natural Philosophy, and Geography ; and discon- 
tinued the Professorships in Oriental Languages, in 
French, and in Law. A Professorship of Natural History 
and Chemistry was instituted as part of the regular aca- 
demical studies. 
On the 16th of July, 1800, Dr. Johnson presented 
his resignation as President, which was accepted, and it 
was resolved that a letter of thanks be addressed to him 
“for his long and faithful services in this Institution.” 
On retiring from the presidency, Dr.Johnson took up 
his residence in Stratford, Connecticut, where he lived to 
enter upon his ninety-third year, “retaining to the last 
his vigor and activity of mind, peer of his literary 
curiosity, and a most lively interest in whatever con- 
cerned the welfare of this country, and of the Christian 
world.” 
The vacancy in the presidency continued a year, during 
which time Professors Kemp and Wilson appear to have 
discharged the duties of the office.

PRESIDENTS CHARLES H. WHARTON AND BENJAMIN 
MOORE 
On May 25, 1801, the Rev. Dr. Charles H. Wharton, 
Rector of St. Mary’s Church, Burlington, New Jersey, was 
elected President, signified his acceptance early in the 
following August, and resigned the office December 11 
of the same year. There is no record in the minutes of 
the Trustees of his having rendered any collegiate ser- 
vice, though Bishop Doane, in a notice of him, speaks of 
his having presided at the Commencement. His accept- 
ance of the presidency of the College did not sever his 
connection with St. Mary’s Church, of which he continued 
to be Rector till his death on July 23, 1833. 
A Committee appointed to “consider and report re- 
specting the office of President” reported on December 
30, “That the Professorship which is annexed to the 
office of President be detached from it ; that the Presi- 
dent be charged merely with a general Superintendence 
of the Institution, including attendance on public Exami- 
nations of the students, the presiding at Commencements, 
and performing the services usually here performed by 
the President ; and that there be a distinct Professor of 
Moral Philosophy, Rhetoric and Belles-lettres and Logic.” 
On the day following this report, the Right Reverend 
Benjamin Moore, of the class of ’68, Bishop of New 
York, who had been President pro tempore after the flight, 
in 1775, of President Cooper, and was Professor of Rheto- 
ric and Logic in the College 1784-1787, was elected Presi-

was made Professor of Moral Philosophy, Rhetoric, and 
Belles-lettres and Logic. 
The Professorship of Chemistry having become vacant 
by the election of Dr. Samuel L. Mitchill to the House of 
Representatives in 1801, and his entrance upon his duties, 
Dr. James 8. Stringham was elected to the chair, Novem- 
ber 18, 1802. The condition of the funds of the College 
did not allow of a salary to him, but the Trustees directed 
“that either the Junior or Senior Class at the Election of 
the Faculty of Arts be directed to attend on the Lectures 
of the said Professor and each student to pay him for the 
Course Eight Dollars, for which sum he shall have the 
Privilege of attending Two Years.” 
The Trustees were very much hampered in their efforts 
by a lack of funds. Appeals to the Legislature for further 
aid were unsuccessful. From a report of Committee, 
made November 17, 1802, it appears “that the whole 
permanent Revenue of the College does not exceed One 
Thousand, Five Hundred and Seventy Pounds per annum, 
and that the stated regular annual salaries to the officers 
thereof” amount to “Fourteen Hundred and Seventy 
Seven Pounds ; leaving a Balance for contingent Expenses 
and Repairs of Ninety Three Pounds.” 
Some addition to the property of the College resulted 
from the cession, in 1802, to Columbia, jointly with Union 
College, by the Regents of the University, of certain lands 
in northern New York, at Lake George, Ticonderoga, and 
Crown Point. Building operations were resumed and 
continued so far as to complete the hall and recitation 
rooms on the north end of the new foundation. On 
August 5, 1805, the Trustees “ Resolved that the Treas- 
urer be, and hereby is requested to lay before this Board, 
with all convenient Speed, a Schedule of the whole real 
and personal Property of Columbia College, specifying 
the several Lots or Portions of Ground, with the Rent

charged on each, the Date and Expiration of the Leases : 
and the Conditions upon which they have been granted : 
and also to annex to the said Schedule a View of the 
Debts due from the Corporation: and of its annual 
Expenditure.” The Treasurer’s report was made on 
the 14th of the following December. From this it 
appears that the real property consisted of: The grant 
made by Trinity Church to the College, May 18, 1755, of 
that portion of the King’s Farm described as “situate, 
lying and being on the West side of the Broadway in the 
West Ward of the city of New York, fronting Easterly 
to Church Street, between Barclay Street and Murray 
Street, 440 feet, and from thence running Westerly be- 
tween and along said Barclay Street and Murray Street to 
the North River.” 
The grant made by the city of New York to the College, 
August 16, 1770, “at the annual Rent of One Pepper 
Corn, all the Waste Ground, Soi. and Water Lots situate, 
lying and being in the Rear of the aforesaid Ground, 
and contiguous thereunto next to the Hudson’s River, 
containing the Whole Breadth of the said Ground 440 
feet English Measure, and in length from the Rear of said 
Ground to low Water Mark into Hudson’s River afore- 
said, and from thence to extend the whole Breadth thereof 
into Hudson’s River aforesaid Two Hundred feet.” 
And the personal property consisted of : Fifteen bonds, 
accounted good aggregating £14,470 16s. 1d. Four bonds, 
accounted bad aggregating £2020. One bond in dispute, 
and, therefore, of uncertain value. 
That of the King’s Farm lots, fifty-eight were leased at 
rents aggregating annually £395 2s. 3d. 
That two of the water lots were leased for sixty-three 
years from March 25, 1782, at an annual rental of £8; 
and that the remaining water lots were leased in per- 
petuity at an annual rental of £158 12s. 9d. 
That the annual income from the bonds was £997    
                                                                     
-P-A-G-E-121
PRESIDENTS WHARTON AND MOORE 85 
2s, 8d. ; and that the total income from bonds and rents 1807 
was £1558 17s. 3d. 
That the salaries paid were: the President, £100; Dr. 
Kemp, £500; Dr. Wilson, £400 ; Dr. Bowden, £400 ; 
Dr. Beach (Secretary of Trustees), £25; the Porter, 
$52; total £1447. 
That the only debt of the corporation was one for 
$5000 “borrowed by order of the Board for building a 
Hall and Lecture Rooms. ... This Debt will be extin- 
guished in a very few years from the increased Revenue 
which must immediately arise from Ground Rents, and 
which may be fairly estimated at One Thousand Pounds 
per Annum.” 
In this schedule, no mention is made of the lands held 
by the College jointly with Union College. It appears 
from a minute made January 20, 1807, that a committee 
of the Trustees was appointed to act with a similar com- 
mittee from Union College to sell the lands at Lake 
George, Ticonderoga, and Crown Point “ for such Prices 
and on such Terms of Credit, and in such manner as the 
said joint Com shall judge most eligible.” It was sub- 
sequently reported to the Board, April 10, 1810, that Mr. 
James Caldwell, of Albany, had offered $5000 for the lands 
at Lake George, “known as Garrison lands,” and the 
Trustees resolved to “accept of the offer for their part of 
the said Lands.” A little more than a year afterward, in 
June, 1811, a deed of the lands was given to Mr. Caldwell. 
(Hence, presumably, “Caldwell’s Landing” on Lake 
George.) ‘The lands at Ticonderoga, with the exception 
of eight acres, were sold in 1820, and the remainder in 
1823, bringing a sum total of $3244.80; the lands at 
Crown Point were finally disposed of in 1828, at $10 
an acre, for $3213.34. 
“Oertain restrictions and defects” in the Charter had 
become evident by experience, and the Trustees, in Feb- 
ruary, 1807, applied for remedial legislation. The Legisla- 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
   86 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1807 ture proved unwilling to grant relief in the form proposed. 
   The bill submitted “provided that in case of the vacancy 
of the seat of any of the Trustees of the said College, it 
shall be the duty of the Trustees to state such vacancy to 
the Regents of the University, and that it shall be the 
duty of the Regents to appoint a proper person to supply 
the same.” Chief-Justice Kent objected to this provision, 
and his objection was sustained by the “ Council of Revi- 
sion” at Albany, “as inconsistent with the spirit of the 
Constitution and the public good,” inasmuch as it “is con- 
trary to a privilege and immunity granted to the said 
College by its charter of the 81st of October, 1754 [which 
had been fully and absolutely ratified and confirmed by 
the Legislature], which authorizes the Trustees to fill up 
such vacancies whenever the same should occur ; and it 
appears by the representations of the Trustees, that the 
said alteration is made without the consent of the corpora- 
tion.” It was not until March 23, 1810, that an approved 
amended Charter was obtained. The immediate incite- 
ment to this Act was an appeal made to the Legislature 
by the Trustees to be liberated “from the very incon- 
venient restrictions of their actual Charter, which long 
experience has ascertained to be many ways injurious, and 
no way profitable to the College. One of the most hurt- 
ful is their incapacity to lease their lands in the city of 
New York for a term longer than twenty-one years. This 
disability both depreciates the value of their property so 
as essentially to affect their resources, which are but 
moderate at the utmost ; and also to preclude the possi- 
bility of improvements much needed and desired in that 
central part of the city where their lots lie.” 
While the efforts for amendment of the Charter were 
being made, a revision of the whole scheme of education 
and discipline in the College was in progress. A commit- 
tee was appointed February 1, 1808, to inquire into the 
present state of education in the College and to “report  
-P-A-G-E-123
PRESIDENTS WHARTON AND MOORE 87 
their opinion generally as to the measures proper for car- 1808 
rying into full effect the design of the Institution.” This 
committee consisted of the Hon. Rufus King, whom Wash- 
ington had sent, in 1796, Minister Plenipotentiary to Great 
Britain, and who had distinguished himself in his eight 
years tenure of that office, the Rev. John Henry Hobart, 
subsequently the distinguished Bishop of New York and 
a founder of the General Theological Seminary of the 
Protestant Episcopal Church in New York, the Rev. John 
M. Mason, a great pulpit orator, sometime Provost of Co- 
lumbia College and President of Dickinson College, the 
Rev. Samuel Miller, afterward Professor of Ecclesiastical 
History and Church Government in the Theological Sem- 
inary at Princeton, New Jersey, and a voluminous writer, 
and the Rey. Dr. John N. Abeel. So far as the “ present 
state of education” was concerned, it would appear that 
the Faculty had become somewhat lax in enforcing the 
requirements for admission, or that there had grown up a 
belief to that effect, for, on October 15, 1808, the Trustees 
adopted a stringent resolution of direction to the Faculty 
and ordered the Clerk of the Board “to insert in one or 
more of the daily Papers printed in this City the following 
Advertisement : The Board of Trustees of Columbia Col- 
lege finding it to be commonly reported and believed that 
Students may be admitted into the College with less quali- 
fications than are prescribed by the Statutes; and wishing 
to arrest the progress of an opinion injurious to the Repu- 
tation of the Seminary, and of which the effects may be 
fatal to the solid education of many Youth; do hereby 
inform the Public that no part of the said Qualifications 
can be dispensed with, and that no Student will hereafter 
be admitted who shall not be well prepared in all the parts 
thereof.” 
As to “the measures for carrying into full effect the 
design of the Institution,” the committee deliberated a 
year, and presented, February 1, 1809, a report which was   
      
 
-P-A-G-E-124
   88 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1809 printed for the use of the Trustees and the Faculty of 
Arts. The Faculty deemed the report an arraignment of 
their conduct of the entrance examinations and of the 
course of study, and made a dignified, able, and somewhat 
caustic reply. ‘The subject was further considered and, 
in July, resulted in the adoption of the following reso- 
lutions : — 
“Resolved : That from and after the first Day of Octo- ber, 1810, no student shall be admitted into the lowest 
Class of the College, unless he be accurately acquainted 
with the Grammar, including Prosody, of both the Greek 
and Latin Tongues; unless he be master of Czsar’s 
Commentaries ; of Cicero’s Orations contained in the 
Volume in usum Delphini; of Virgil’s Aneid; of the 
Greek Testament ; of Dalzel’s Collectanea Minora ; of 
the first four Books of Xenophon’s Cyropedia, and the first Two Books of Homer’s Iliad. He shall algo be able to translate English into grammatical Latin; and shall be versed in the first four Rules of Arithmetic, the Rule of 
Three direct and inverse, and decimal and vulgar Frac- 
tions. The classical Examinations to be ad aperturam Libri. 
“Resolved ; That no Student shall be admitted into any of the higher Classes without an exact knowledge of those Studies which belong to the Classes below.” 
By comparing with these requirements, those for ad- 
mission adopted in 1785 and in force up to this time, 
it will be seen what advance was made. The Statutes of 
1785 ordained “No candidate shall be admitted into the 
College, after the second Tuesday in April 1786, unless 
he shall be able to render into English Cxsar’s Commen- 
taries of the Gallic War; the four Orations of Cicero 
against Catiline ; the four first books of Virgil’s Aneid ; 
and the Gospels from the Greek : And to explain the gov- 
ernment and connection of the words, and to turn English 
into grammatical Latin, and shall understand the four first 
rules of Arithmetic, with the rule of three.” 
   
-P-A-G-E-125
PRESIDENTS WHARTON AND MOORE 89 
The same committee, to which the Rev. Dr. John Brod- 1810 
hed Romeyn was subsequently added, was requested “ to 
report a System of Discipline as well for inciting to laud- 
able Emulation, as for preventing and punishing of Faults, 
to be conducted upon a Principle of a Regard to Char- 
acter; and that the Com' revise the existing Statutes as 
far as may be necessary for carrying that System and the 
aforegoing Resolutions into effect.” This committee pre- 
sented, February 28, 1810, with their system of discipline 
and revision of the Statutes, a very able report giving their 
views upon the primary principles of education and the 
proper mode of applying them. The exposition was, in 
part, as follows :— 
“It appears to your Committee that the primary prin- 
ciple of all sound education, viz. the evolution of faculty 
and the formation of habit, although deplorably neglected 
in most seminaries, ought to be so thoroughly incorporated 
in the College system, and even amalgamated with its 
very elements, as to render progress through the classes, 
without due regard to it by both teacher and pupil, alto- 
gether impracticable. If the plan be so constructed as to 
require ability and diligence, the want of either of these 
qualifications in the teacher will betray itself in the em- 
barrassment of his department: and the want of either 
of them in the pupil will be discovered by his habitual 
failure in duties which a reasonable share of both would 
have fitted him to perform. Your Committee cannot, for 
a moment, suppose, that it is the intention of the Board 
to try that most fruitless and mischievous experiment — 
the experiment of educating either the naturally stupid, 
or the incurably idle. A volume could not display the 
magnitude of the injuries inflicted upon letters, upon re- 
ligion, upon morals, upon social prosperity under every 
form, through the protection granted to incapacity and 
sloth, by a timid indulgence, or a chimerical hope. It is, 
therefore, indispensable that the public should see, and 
youth themselves feel, that future students must both have 
faculties to cultivate, and industry to labor in their cultiva- 
tion, or that Columbia College will be no place for them. 
“With a sufficient reserve for improvements which the

1810 vigilance of skilful instructors may point out in the prac- tical details, your Committee think, that there ought to be an undeviating adherence to the following principles, and their general applications. 
“1. Exactness. By which is understood, the learning perfectly whatev er is professed to be learned at all.” 
“2. Punctuality. By which your Committee mean, that the performance of all exercises should be limited to a certain time, a

on. By which your Committee would

to more difficult and ample, according to the power of performance.” 
“During the

e kept upon the stretch. As they devel- 
nd gain strength, they are to be employed

And it was further ordained that: the “ Examinations 
be conducted in a solemn manner ;” no student deficient 
in the studies of a year “shall be permitted, on any ac- 
count whatever, to proceed to a higher class ;” “students, 
at the close of every examination, shall take rank in the 
class according to their respective merit ;” on special ex- 
amination for honors held once a year, students who most 
distinguish themselves shall receive premiums, to consist 
of gold and silver medals and books of definite value to 
be “ conferred in the most public and impressive manner ; ” 
a student found “incompetent to his studies” shall be

   him to proceed to a higher class, after remaining for two 
years in a preceding one, shall always be considered as 
proof of incompetency or negligence requiring dismis- 
sion 5.7’. no aden shall, during the months of study, 
attend any public amusement on pain of dismission; ” “no 
expelled student shall be readmitted, nor shall any expelled 
student from any other College be admitted.” 
The Professorship of Chemistry was assigned to the 
Faculty of Medicine and detached from the Faculty of 
Arts, which was thereafter to consist of five Professors, 
one each in the following departments: Greek and Latin 
Languages, including the Greek and Roman Antiquities; 
Rhetoric and Belles-lettres; Mathematics and Natural 
Philosophy; Geography, Chronology, and History; the 
Science of Mind and Morals, with the Principles of Public 
Law. All fees to the Professors were abolished, and each 
student was to pay into the treasury of the College $100. 
The President was to receive in addition to a dwelling 
house provided by the College an annual salary of $3500; 
and each Professor, in addition to a house, $2500. A 
subscription was to be opened “for the procuring of 
funds towards the extending of the public buildings, of 
the library, and philosophical apparatus of the College.” 
An address to the public was soon after prepared, bearing 
date July 80, 1810, in which the Trustees state that in 
consequence of “their funds having been greatly impaired 
by the Revolutionary War, and by the loss of large landed 
property in the State of Vermont,” they are under the 
necessity of resorting to the liberality of public-spirited 
individuals, and say “In making their appeal to the 
citizens of New York, they feel a confidence of success 
proportioned to the value of the object, and the justly 
famed munificence of the City. As the College is im- 
mediately intended for the benefit of the Youth of our own 
City and its vicinity; and as no application has been
-P-A-G-E-129
  PRESIDENTS WHARTON AND MOORE 93 
made to private bounty on its behalf, for more than fifty 1810 
years, the Trustees indulge a hope that they shall be 
amply supported by their fellow-citizens, in their efforts 
to render Columbia College a seat of learning every way 
worthy of the commercial Metropolis of the United States.” 
The clear enunciation and eloquent exposition of the 
fundamental principles of education contained in the 
report of the Committee, and their practical embodiment 
in a course of study and system of discipline, were very 
important in the history of the College. The Trustees 
expressed the opinion that the effect of their action 
was “to lay a broader basis for sound and thorough edu- 
cation than (as they believed) has hitherto been known 
in these States.” The policy adopted controlled the 
progress of events for many years. 
In the years succeeding the Revolution there was for 
a time a Society for Progress in Letters. This be- 
came extinct in 1795. In 1802 the Philolexian Society 
was founded, and in 1806 the Peithologian Society. They 
were given the use of rooms in the College and soon 
became centres of student life, both literary and social. 
In the absence of athletics and other undergraduate 
organizations, they occupied a prominent place and con- 
stituted the chief interest among the a It is 
interesting to note that the color of the Philolexian Soci- 
ety was white and the color of the Peithologian blue, and 
that the two together make the “ Colors of Columbia, the 
dashing White and Blue.” 
With the close of the academic year 1810, twenty-five 
classes had been graduated since the revival of the College 
in 1784. The average number of graduates each year 
during this period was about seventeen. The classes, 
though small in number, seem to have made up in quality 
what they lacked in quantity. There was scarcely a year 
that the community was not enriched, from this source, 
by men who became influential in promoting the welfare

BrsHop Moore was prevented by the pressure of paro- 
chial and diocesan duties from giving much attention to 
the affairs of the College. His duties as President were ac- 
cordingly performed for the most part by the Professors in 
rotation. The result was so unsatisfactory that even the 
friends of the College “almost despaired of its resuscita- 
tion.” The situation was rendered more unhappy by the 
survival or recrudescence, in the Board of Trustees, as 
well as in a portion of the community at large, of the 
odium theologicum that had antagonized and somewhat de- 
layed the issuance of a charter to King’s College. 
Early in March, 1811, Bishop Moore resigned the presi- 
dency, and a committee was appointed to consider “ what 
measures are proper to be pursued with respect to the 
appointment of a President.” The enlarged and improved 
scheme of study and discipline recently adopted, and the 
comprehensive and strong report with which it was intro- 
duced, had attracted attention and comment, and very 
great interest was felt in the choice of an officer to admin- 
ister it. An influential party desired the election of the 
Rev. Dr. John M. Mason, of the class of ’89, one of the 
committee that had introduced the new curriculum. He 
appeared, however, to be ineligible to the presidency by 
reason of the condition of the grant of land made by Trin- 
ity Church that the President should be a communicant of 
the Episcopal Church. This restriction had been elimi- 
nated from the Charter by the Legislature, but the pre- 
H 97

1811 vailing opinion, nevertheless, was that it still remained in force as to the land, which would be forfeited by its non- 
observance. The determination to secure the services of Dr. Mason was, however, so strong that, on recommendation 
of the Committee, an executive officer, additional and really 
superior to the President, was provided for, styled the 
Provost. The President was to superintend the buildings 
and grounds, to report to the Trustees, as occasion might 
require, the state of the College and measures that he 
deemed necessary for its prosperity, to have power to visit 
the classes and any of the College apartments, to give such directions and perform such acts generally as were calcu- 
lated, in his opinion, to promote the interests of the insti- 
tution, to preside at Commencements and meetings of the 
Board of the College, and to sign all diplomas. The Pro- 
vost was to have all the duties and powers committed to the 
President, except that he was to preside at Commencements 
and meetings of the College Board only in the absence of the 
latter, and, in addition, was to grant leave of absence from 
College in his discretion, to see that the prescribed course 
of instruction and discipline was faithfully followed, and 
to rectify all deviations from it, and to conduct the classical 
studies of the senior class. Under this arrangement, the 
Rev. Dr. William Harris, a Harvard alumnus of the class 
of ’86, was in June, 1811, elected President, and the Rev. 
Dr. Mason, Provost. Under a special act of the Legisla- 
ture, Dr. Mason was subsequently (1812) made a Trustee. 
Considerable feeling seems to have been engendered by the outcome of the contest. There was an attempt made 
to bring the alleged violation of the condition as to the 
presidency to the attention of the Legislature, but nothing 
came of it. 
The first Commencement at which Dr. Harris presided 
was known as the “ Riotous Commencement” and was 
held August 7, 1811, in Trinity Church. The “riot” 
was occasioned by the denial to a member of the graduat-

ing class of his diploma because of his refusal to amend 1811 
the language of his Commencement oration as directed by 
the Faculty. The student appealed to the audience, and the 
response was ready and violent. Several of the partici- 
pants, one of them a recent graduate and subsequently a 
man of distinction in literature and politics, were arrested, 
indicted, tried before Mayor De Witt Clinton, and fined 
in substantial amounts. ‘The trial and its results engen- 
dered bitter feelings that made themselves felt in New 
York politics for many years. 
The discipline of the College appears to have soon 
become more exacting, and strenuous efforts were made to 
give effect to the “new system » of education. That sys- 
tem required, for its full execution, an increase of annual 
expenditure, which was not feasible without aid from the 
Legislature, for which the Trustees applied “with the 
confidence naturally inspired by the ample donations made 
by your honorable body to various Seminaries of learning.” 
Their appeal proved unavailing for a considerable period, 
during which they struggled with their accustomed energy, 
fidelity, and wisdom, to produce the happiest effects possi- 
ble with the “ present scanty funds of the Institution.” 
Dr. Kemp, the Professor of Mathematics and Natural 
Philosophy, died in November, 1812. His death was a 
serious loss to the College, and was greatly deplored by 
the Trustees, who expressed their “deep concern ” in reso- 
lutions attesting his “ great ability and fidelity.” During 
the illness which preceded his death, Mr. James Renwick, 
of the class of 07, conducted the studies of the senior class 
in Natural Philosophy, of which he afterward became Pro- 
fessor, and Mr. Henry Vethake, of the class of 08, instructed 
the classes in Mathematics. Their services were continued 
for some time, and in May, 1818, Mr. Robert Adrain was 
elected to the vacant chair. 
Again, in March, 1814, the Trustees addressed themselves 
to the Legislature for financial aid. They presented a 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
100 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1814 very urgent memorial and appeal, in which, after declar- ing “their firm conviction, justified, as they suppose, by indisputable facts, that the whole instruction to be acquired in Columbia College will not suffer in Comparison with that of any other American Colleges in its present state, which they consider as an earnest of what they may ex- pect it will shortly become,” they say: — 
“Situated in the most important City of the State, an Object of Curiosity and Remark to Strangers; and indis- pensable in its position, to a large portion of the Students who must obtain a liberal Education on the spot, or be deprived of it altogether, Columbia College presents a Spectacle mortifying to its friends, humiliating to the City, and calculated to inspire opinions which it is impos- sible your enlightened body wish to countenance. “The foundation of a new wing to the Edifice, laid by the order and under an Appropriation of your honorable body, has been for Years, a heap of ruins solely for want of further public Assistance. 
“The Library of the College, which fell a sacrifice to the war of independence, has never been replaced but in so slender a degree as to make it a subject of ignominious Comparison with the pre-eminence, in this Respect, of other American Colleges. 
“The Philosophical Apparatus, originally good, has been damaged by long use, and unavoidable Accident, and is now incompetent to the advanced State of physical Science. “There is no proper Apartment for the Reception of a decent Library. There is no Hall fit for the Performance of public Exercises. There is no astronomical Observa- tory which is of essential moment both to our commercial and military marine: a solid basis for such a Structure was laid at the same time with the foundation of the new wing and left unfinished for the same Cause. “Your MeEmoriauists are under the necessity of ex- acting, in two Instances, the Labors of two Professorships from one Person, which renders the toil unreasonable and oppressive. They have found it due to the State of Science and to public Opinion to institute a Professorship of Chem- istry as a part of the academical Course, and have ap- pointed a Professor without being able to give him any

PRESIDENT HARRIS AND PROVOST MASON 101 
Compensation. They cannot employ Tutors to assist the 1814 
Professors, an expedient found to be of eminent Utility 
in other Colleges. They cannot afford gratuitous Edu- 
cation to youth whose humble Circumstances debar them 
from its advantages, while their talents and Virtues might 
render them Ornaments and blessings to their country. 
They cannot erect buildings suitable for the Accommo- 
dation of the Students during the hours of Study, from 
which Circumstance much time is lost and injury sustained. 
“ All these Difficulties and Embarrassments proceed 
solely from the Scantiness of their funds. 
“Your MeEmoriatists flatter themselves that no 
literary Institution in the State can offer to the contem- 
plation of your honorable Body a case more fully entitled 
to legislative Sympathy and Succor. 
“ Your MEMORIALISTS are emboldened to hope that 
their Appeal to the magnanimity of your honorable Body 
will not be fruitless, especially when in addition to the 
preceding View, they respectfully add 
“1, That the patronage which Columbia College has 
received for a period of Thirty Years has been limited and 
has not in the Aggregate amounted Gf your Memorialists 
are correctly informed) to one fifth part of the benefac- 
tions made with the most praiseworthy Munificence to a 
Kindred Institution. 
“2. That Columbia College was once in possession of 
landed property, which, if she still retained it, would be 
amply sufficient for her wants, and would save your Memo- 
rialists from the afflicting necessity of importuning your 
honorable body. That property was transferred by the 
State of New York, on great political Considerations, to 
other hands. It was entirely lost to the College, and no 
Relief, under the privations which the loss occasioned, has 
hitherto been extended to her. 
“Your MEMOoRIALISTS therefore pray that your hon- 
orable body will take the Premises into favorable Con- 
sideration, & grant such assistance therein as to your 
wisdom shall seem meet.” 
Moved by this appeal, the Legislature granted to the 
Trustees the “ Botanic Garden,” which had been established 
and for some years conducted by Dr. David Hosack in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-142
   102 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1814 interest of medical science, and “lately conveyed to the 
   people of this State” by him. This tract of land, situated 
on what is now 47th and 51st streets and running from 
Fifth Avenue to within about one hundred feet of Sixth 
Avenue and constituting at present a very valuable 
possession, was then about three miles out of town. It 
was referred to, in official College documents, as “ within 
a few miles of the City,” and, though estimated by the 
Legislature to be worth $75,000, “would not, upon a 
sale, bring more than six or seven thousand dollars.” 
It was not considered an attractive and helpful gift to 
the Trustees, particularly as its grant was coupled with 
the express condition that the “College establishment ” 
should be removed thither within twelve years. This 
injurious restriction continued for five years and was then, 
after much effort by the friends of the College, repealed. 
Dr. Mason had been one of the severest critics of the 
methods of administration that prevailed during the presi- 
dency of Bishop Moore, and was believed to possess great 
executive capacity. He was one of the most active of the 
Board of Trustees and was doubtless largely influential in 
securing for the College from the Legislature the grant of 
Dr. Hosack’s “Elgin Botanical Garden.” As a College 
administrator, he appears not to have equalled expectation, 
and in July, 1816, resigned the Provostship and severed 
his connection with the College. His powers and duties 
as Provost were devolved upon the President, except that 
the instruction of the senior class in the classics was 
remitted to the Professor of the Greek and Latin Lan- 
guages. The President was, however, in addition to his 
other duties, charged with the instruction of the students 
in English composition. 
The removal of the College, which the Legislature 
designed to enforce by the Act granting the Botanic 
Garden, had been thought of by the Trustees prior to the 
enactment, and was soon after again considered. In  
-P-A-G-E-143
PRESIDENT HARRIS AND PROVOST MASON = 103 
November, 1802, a committee was appointed “to enquire 1816 
and report on the Subject of finishing the Wing to the 
College Building; taking into Consideration the Pro- 
priety of removing the College to some more convenient 
Situation.” Nothing appears to have come from this 
inquiry. In July, 1813, Mr., afterward Professor, Ren- 
wick addressed to the Trustees a letter relative to certain 
improvements of the College grounds. This letter was 
referred to a committee, and the subject was considered 
from time to time. Ata Meeting of the Trustees on 
March 14, 1816, the Committee was requested to inquire 
«whether an eligible site for a College could be found at 
a distance from the City not greater than Art Street” 
(now Astor Place). On their report, May 6 following, 
a committee was directed to “negotiate for the purchase, 
of the representatives of Anthony L. Bleecker deceased, 
of a piece of ground near Colonel Varick’s place, contain- 
ing thirty-two lots, and that they report to the Board, 
with all convenient speed, the lowest price at which 
the same can be obtained.” Two weeks later the com- 
mittee reported “that the ground might be purchased for 
seven hundred dollars a lot,” which the Board deemed 
greater than was expedient for them to give, and the 
matter was dropped. 
A letter to the Trustees from Daniel D. Tompkins, Gov- 
ernor of New York, an alumnus of the College of the class 
of °95, dated February 27, 1817, enclosed a copy of a 
resolution adopted by the Regents of the University 
shortly before, and asked early consideration for it. The 
resolution was as follows : — 
“ Resolved that it be and hereby is recommended to the 
Trustees of Columbia College to unite in a consolidation 
of the funds and property of said College with those of 
Washington College on Staten Island for which a Con- 
ditional Charter has been granted ; if the consent of the 
Corporation of Trinity Church can be obtained ; and that 
 
-P-A-G-E-144
   104 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1817 it be further recommended to the Trustees of said College, 
   if they approve of the consolidation suggested, to negotiate 
with the Corporation of Trinity Church the terms upon 
which said Corporation will agree to relinquish the con- 
ditions in their grant to Columbia College, which fix the 
site of said College in the City of New York, and require 
that the President shall be a member of the Protestant 
Episcopal Church, and report the result to the Regents 
that it may be submitted to the Legislature at their present 
session.” 
Governor Tompkins suggested terms that he deemed 
eligible and beneficial to all parties. 
The subject was referred for report to a committee 
consisting of Hon. Richard Harison, Hon. Rufus King, 
Judge Brockholst Livingston, Bishop Hobart, and William 
Johnson, LL.D. The committee, in a full and carefully 
prepared report presented at a special meeting of the 
Trustees, held March 27, say they have considered the 
subject “with all the Attention due to its intrinsic Impor- 
tance, and the high Character and Station of those by 
whom it was recommended” ; that they cannot find it 
“consistent with the Duty of faithful Trustees, and 
necessary for the Advancement of Literature and Science,” 
to promote the union of the two Institutions, and that ‘ the 
Proposals for uniting Columbia College with the College 
to be established on Staten Island ought not to be ac- 
cepted.” 
The report was unanimously approved. This seemed 
to settle the question of removal for an indefinite time, 
and the matter passed from the minds of the Trustees. 
As no change was to be made in location, the state of 
the buildings demanded early attention — as “the reputa- 
tion of the College, in the view of the public, greatly 
suffers, from the apparent neglect and decay of its 
edifices.” On a careful investigation of the necessities of 
the case and of the funds procurable to meet the expense, 
it was concluded that “the most economical plan which 
 
-P-A-G-E-145
PRESIDENT HARRIS AND PROVOST MASON 105 
can be pursued, in order to meet the present exigencies of 
the College, will be, to erect, at each extremity of the old 
building, a, block or wing of about fifty feet square; each 
wing to contain two houses for Professors, facing the Col- 
lege Green, and projecting beyond the front of the old 
building, so as to be on a line with the fronts of the 
houses on the north side of Park Place. The old build- 
ing, by means of some interior alterations, will afford 
ample accommodation for the purposes of instruction, 
together with a Library and a Chapel” (September 1, 
1817). The expense was estimated to be about $40,000, 
which could be met by the sale of stocks and bonds to the 
amount of about $32,000, the use of two-thirds of one 
year’s surplus revenue, about $2000, and by a loan for the 
remainder. ‘The plan was adopted and a committee 
appointed to carry it into execution (September 6, 
1817). In the course of building, aid was received from 
the Legislature by an Act, passed February 19, 1819, 
removing the condition attached to the grant of the 
Botanic Garden, that the College establishment should 
be removed thereto or to land adjacent, and making the 
tract available, therefore, for sale or lease, and contribut- 
ing the sum of $10,000 “out of any monies not otherwise 
appropriated.” The building committee finished its 
labors and rendered its final report October 2, 1820. It 
appears from this that the expenditures of the committee 
far exceeded the estimate, and amounted to $80,741.47. 
The Rev. Dr. Bowden of the class of ’72, who had 
been Professor of Moral Philosophy, Rhetoric, and Belles- 
lettres and logic since 1801, died in 1817, and the Trustees 
recorded their high sense of his learning and ability “ to- 
gether with the most unfeigned veneration for the 
example, displayed by him, of all the moral and Christian 
virtues.” The Rev. John McVickar, of the class of 04, 
was elected his successor, and entered upon that long and 
distinguished career in connection with the College which 1817 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
106 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1818 ended only with his death in 1868. At the same time, to 
give Dr. Wilson, Professor of the Greek and Latin Lan- 
guages, the relief rendered necessary by his advancing 
years, and that he might devote his time to the higher 
classes, there was established an Adjunct Professorship in 
that department. The duties of the Adjunct Professor 
were to take especial charge of the freshman class, and 
“to see that the members of the Class are employed upon 
those Languages under his inspection for at least four 
hours in every day appropriated by the statutes for study, 
and that those hours be so chosen as not to interfere with 
the attendance of the Class upon any of the other Pro- 
fessors.” The freshman class was thereafter relieved 
from the requirement to write English compositions for 
the inspection of the President. Nathaniel F. Moore, of 
the class of ’02, was elected Adjunct Professor. In 
referring to this arrangement in their report to the 
Regents of the University in February, 1818, the Trustees 
remark that “from the acknowledged abilities and zeal of 
Mr. Moore and the Exertions of Dr. Wilson the Trustees 
entertain a Hope (which they consider as well grounded) 
that the Alumni of this College will continue to be distin- 
guished by a Character derived from what has been 
elegantly termed ‘the wholesome and invigorating Dis- 
cipline of classical Learning.’” Dr. Wilson resigned his 
Professorship in February, 1820, and for his “ faithful and 
eminently useful services during the period of twenty- 
eight years” he was granted an annuity of $1500 for his 
life. Adjunct Professor Moore was chosen his successor, 
and for fifteen years administered the office with great 
satisfaction to the Trustees and benefit to the students. 
He had the advantage in his labors of the codperation of 
Charles Anthon, of the class of ’15, who was made 
Adjunct Professor. Not long afterward, in May, 1820, 
the Professorship of Mathematics and Natural Philoso- 
phy was divided into a Professorship of Mathematics 
 
-P-A-G-E-147
PRESIDENT HARRIS AND PROVOST MASON 107 
and Astronomy and a Professorship of Natural and Ex- 1821 
perimental Philosophy and Chemistry. Professor Adrain 
was assigned to the former, and in December, James Ren- 
wick, of the class of ’07, was elected to the latter. 
The number of students in the College at this time was 
one hundred and thirty-five. Early in the year 1821, the 
Trustees adopted a new body of statutes, in which the 
requirements for admission were raised, and the curricu- 
lum enlarged and improved. The Professors were to be 
“engaged in the instruction of the classes five days in the 
week, and, at least, three hours in each day ;” they were 
to teach “subjects rather than whole books,” “ keeping in 
view the principles of the Report presented to the 
Trustees of the College on the twenty-eighth day of Feb- 
ruary 1810” of which an extract was annexed; the 
classes were to be assembled “every morning, except 
Sunday, at nine o'clock, for the purpose of attend- 
ing prayers,” after which, on Saturdays, six at least of the 
senior class, and on other days of the week one at least 
from each of the other classes, were to pronounce decla- 
mations ; the officers of the College in charge of the course 
of instruction and discipline were prohibited from engag- 
ing “in any professional pursuits from which they derive 
emolument and which are not connected with the Col- 
lege ;” there were to be “two examinations of all the 
classes every year, the one to commence on the first Tues- 
day in March, and the other on the first Tuesday in 
July ;” the Commencement was to be held “on the 
first Tuesday in August” after which there was to be a 
vacation until the first Monday in October ; there was to 
be an “intermission of the public lectures on the fourth 
day of July, on the twenty-fifth day of November, and 
from the twenty-fourth day of December until the fourth 
day of January.” The two examinations were public, 
notice of the time of their commencement was given in 
two of the daily papers published in the City, the Regents 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
108 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1821 of the University, the Trustees of the College, the parents 
and guardians of the students, and such other persons as 
the President might think proper, were requested to 
attend, and the time consumed by each of them was about 
one month. The Library was in general charge of a 
committee of the Trustees, the junior Professor was, 
ex officio, Librarian under the direction of the President: 
the only persons privileged to take books from the 
Library, which was open for the purpose of delivery from 
12 to 2 o’clock every Saturday, were “ the Trustees of the 
College, the President and Professors, the students of the 
Senior and Junior Classes, and such of the graduates of 
the College, residing in the city of New York, as shall 
contribute towards the expenses of the Library the sum of 
four dollars annually.” The annual tuition fee of the 
students was $80. 
At the Commencement in 1821, the honorary degree of 
Master of Arts was conferred upon Washington Irving. 
In a letter of acknowledgment to the President of the 
College, under date « London, August 6, 1821,” Mr. Irving 
says, “I beg you will communicate to the Board of Trus- 
tees my deep sense of their unexpected, and, I must say, 
unmerited kindness; I feel that it is far, far beyond my 
deserts. Nothing is nearer to my heart than the desire 
of meriting the good opinion of my countrymen; and, 
above all, of my townsmen ; but their good will has out- 
stripped all my efforts; and I despair of ever doing 
enough to prove myself worthy of the rewards already 
lavished upon me.” 
In November, 1825, Professor Adrain resigned the Pro- 
fessorship of Mathematics and Astronomy. He recom- 
mended Dr. Henry James Anderson, of the class of ’18, 
as his successor, commending him for “his great acquire- 
ments in Science and his incomparable sagacity and acute- 
ness in his researches.” Dr. Anderson was chosen, and for 
eighteen years actively discharged the duties of his office. 
 
-P-A-G-E-149
PRESIDENT HARRIS AND PROVOST MASON 109 
At the close of the year 1825, the College was in charge 1825 
of a Faculty composed wholly of its own alumni (the 
Professor of Law was not a member of the governing 
Board) — Moore, McVickar, Renwick, Anthon, Anderson 
—all remarkable for elegant accomplishment in their 
several departments, destined to have long and influential 
connection with their alma mater and to contribute, in a 
substantial manner, through the many young men whom 
they taught and inspired and through their own lucubra- 
tions, to the advancement of learning and the well-being 
of the community. 
In December, 1827, a Grammar School in connection 
with the College was resolved upon and the plan of it 
adopted. The school was not to be opened till forty 
pupils should be pledged who would pay $12.50 quarterly. 
The plan was unsuccessful; a new one was devised, which 
was put into operation in the spring of 1828, with Mr. 
John D. Ogilby as Headmaster. There were reported 
eighty-seven pupils in the school, December 1, 1828. Mr. 
Ogilby had been a student in the College, in the class of 
1829 during its sophomore and junior years. Because 
of the record made during his studentship and of his suc- 
cessful management of the school, he was granted the 
degree of Bachelor of Arts with his class in 1829. The 
increasing number of students in the Grammar School 
induced the Trustees to erect a special building for its 
use, and one was built, for about $8500, and opened in 
September, 1829. For a time the school became more 
prosperous — but the unsatisfactory nature of its connec- 
tion with the College, the responsibility of the Headmaster 
and his lack of independent power, led to depreciation in 
its excellence, and Mr. Ogilby retired in November, 1830. 
Professor Anthon then took charge and conducted the 
school in addition to his labors as Professor in the Col- 
lege. Dr. Anthon, with his rare energy and ability as a 
teacher and an administrator, raised the standard of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
  110 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1829 school, of which he was made Rector. For a third of a 
century, during which he conducted it, it was, perhaps, 
the most noted school in the city of New York. By an 
arrangement with the Trustees, made May 1, 1833, the 
school, while retaining its nominal connection with the 
College, became really a private enterprise. Dr. Anthon 
retired from the Rectorship, and the school ceased to 
have any connection with the College, in 1864. 
In July, 1828, Mr. Charles Clinton, son of Governor De 
Witt Clinton, presented to the Trustees the chair in 
which his father was seated at the time of his death. 
The last literary effort of Governor Clinton was the ad- 
dress that he delivered before the alumni of Columbia 
College, May 8, 1827, in which he expressed his gratitude 
and attachment to his alma mater. On motion of Bishop 
Hobart, the Trustees accepted with “ grateful veneration 
for the memory of the late Governor Clinton, an alumnus 
of this College, the chair in which he was seated at the 
time of his death,” and caused “a suitable plate and in- 
scription to be placed upon the same.” The chair is now 
in the office of the President of the University. 
In the fall of 1829, President Harris died, after an 
illness of some time. During the periods of his absence 
through illness, Professor MeVickar discharged the duties 
of the presidency and continued to do so till the election 
of a successor, the Hon. William A. Duer, a Judge in 
Equity. Mr. Duer accepted the office January 5, 1830. 
During President Harris’s ineumbency the younger 
alumni appear to have associated themselves together for 
social intercourse and literary improvement. The min- 
utes of the Trustees of the College of October 16, 1816, 
refer to the granting of the application of a “Society con- 
sisting of graduates of Columbia College established for 
the purpose of reading papers on literary and scientific 
subjects” for leave to fit up and use a room in the 
College. The formation of this society is the earliest

PRESIDENT HARRIS AND PROVOST MASON celal 
evidence at hand of organized action by the Alumni as 1825 
such; it was followed on May 4, 1825, by “ The Society 
of the Alumni of Columbia College,’ which was the fore- 
runner of the present Alumni Association. Another 
literary association established about this time (1824) 
had an interesting history.1 On the 4th of December, 
1824, fifteen undergraduates and recent graduates of the 
College, “desirous of occupying their leisure in exercises 
for improvement in polite letters,” associated themselves 
together under the name of the Chi Kappa Gamma Soci- 
ety. Out of this grew “The Column,” a famous society 
in its day, which was founded October 10, 1825, and “ de- 
signed to be subordinate to the Chi Kappa Gamma.” It 
soon outgrew the parent society, the meetings of which 
accordingly declined in interest and were abandoned. 
“The Column ” had an active existence for over twenty 
years; it retained its separate life and identity until 1902, 
when it was merged in the Century Association of New 
York City, which, by the action of the sole surviving 
members, the Hon. John Bigelow and Parke Godwin, 
Esq., became the possessor of its traditions and of its 
beautiful emblem, a silver column.

  CHAPTER X 
1830-1849 
PRESIDENTS WILLIAM A. DUER AND NATHANIEL F. 
| MOORE 
THE year 1830 was one of great anxiety to the Trustees 
and of great activity on their part. New educational 
enterprises were agitated by the community. In particu- 
lar, there was a proposition to establish another institution 
of learning in the city, to be styled the University of the 
City of New York. It was to be a “ University established 
on a liberal, and extensive foundation,” to “extend the 
benefit of education in greater abundance and variety” 
than were offered in any institution previously established, 
and on these grounds the public was appealed to for assist- 
ance in carrying out “this great enterprise.” Much inter- 
est and enthusiasm appear to have been awakened, and 
subscriptions to a very considerable amount were early 
obtained. The Rev. Dr. James M. Matthews resigned on 
January 16, 1830, his position as Trustee of the College 
and later became Chancellor of the new University. The 
Trustees were much concerned as to the effect that the 
new movement might have upon their own especial charge. 
They revised and added to the course of instruction. In 
addition to the regular course leading to the degree of 
Bachelor of Arts, a new course, designated the “ Scientific 
and Literary Course,” was established (January 16, 1830). 
It was ordained that the “scientific and literary course 
shall embrace all the studies now pursued in the College, 
except those of the Greek and Latin languages : and such 
other studies in literature and the sciences as may here- 
after be annexed thereto ;” that either matriculated or

PRESIDENTS DUER AND MOORE 113 
non-matriculated persons might attend the course or any 1830 
part of it on paying the prescribed fees ($15 a year for 
each Professor attended) ; that satisfactory completion of 
the course or any part of it by a matriculated student was 
to be certified by a testimonial, announced at the public 
Commencement ; that public lectureships should be estab- 
lished in the following departments: Greek Literature ; 
Latin Literature; Oriental Literature ; English Litera- 
ture; Chemistry and its applications; Mechanics and 
Machines; Mineralogy and Geology; Architecture and 
Civil Engineering ; Intellectual Philosophy ; Moral Phi- 
losophy ; Elocution ; the Law of Nations and Constitu- 
tional Law; Political Economy ; Mathematical Science ; 
Experimental Philosophy ; Physical and Practical Astron- 
omy; that the Professors might at their option be lec- 
turers, and others were to be appointed by the Trustees. 
A number of free scholarships was created. It had pre- 
viously been enacted that any preparatory school, which 
should send five students to the College in any one year, 
should be entitled to have one student educated free of 
charge for tuition. It was now provided that 
“the corporation of the City of New York, the Trustees of 
the High School of the said City, the Trustees of the New 
York Public School Society, the Trustees or Directors of 
the Clinton Hall Association, and of the Mechanic and 
Scientific Institution, the General Society of Mechanics 
and Tradesmen of the City of New York, and such other 
societies as the Trustees may, from time to time, designate, 
shall each be entitled to have always two students edu- 
cated in the College, free of charge of tuition. Every 
religious denomination in the City of New York, by its 
authorized representatives, shall be entitled to have always 
one student, who may be designed for the ministry, educated 
in the College, free of charges of tuition. Any person or 
persons who may found a scholarship, to the amount of 
one thousand dollars, shall be entitled to have one student 
educated in the College free of all charges of tuition. 
This right may be transferred to others.” It was further 
1 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
   114 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1830 provided that “any religious denomination or any person 
   or persons who shall endow a Professorship in the Classics, 
in Political, Mathematical or Physical Science, or in the 
Literature of any of the ancient or modern languages, to 
the amount of fifteen thousand dollars, shall, forever, have 
the right of nominating a Professor for the same, subject 
to the approbation of the Board of Trustees.” 
A committee, consisting of Bishop Hobart, Judge Irving, 
and Mr. Boyd, was appointed by the Trustees to confer 
with a like committee “appointed on the part of persons 
proposing to establish a University in this City” — but 
nothing seems to have resulted from any conference. 
The following additional appointments were made on 
February 8, 1830: Rev. Dr. Samuel H. Turner, Professor 
of the Hebrew Language and Literature ; Mariano Velas- 
quez de la Cadefia, Professor of the Spanish Language and 
Literature — both “on the same terms and tenure with 
the Professor of Law,” i.e. they were not upon salaries, 
were not members of the governing body of the College, 
and could have occupations outside of their College work 
—the Rev. Manton Eastburn, class of ’17, afterward the 
Bishop of Massachusetts, Lecturer on Poetry, and Dr. 
William H. Ellet, Lecturer on Chemistry. 
A Professorship of the Italian Language and Literature 
had already been established (1825), and filled by the 
appointment of Signore Lorenzo Da Ponte, an Italian 
gentleman, a poet, a musician, and an elegant scholar. 
At this same time (February, 1830) communication 
was made to the Navy Department of the United States, 
through Commodore Chauncey, Commander of the Naval 
Station at New York, to the effect that “there is in 
Columbia College a regular course of pure mathematical 
science, partly conducted by lectures aud partly by 
recitations, from the elements up to the highest depart- 
ments of analysis, and which is extended by the Professor 
to the illustration of Physical Astronomy; this course in- 
 
-P-A-G-E-159
PRESIDENTS DUER AND MOORE 115 
cludes the theory of Navigation. There are also regular 1830 
courses of the theory of Practical Astronomy, of Chemistry, 
and of Natural and Experimental Philosophy. The latter 
course embraces the theory of Gunnery, of the Steam-engine, 
and of the Form and Structure of Ships ” — and proposing 
to “admit to the lectures of both these departments all mid- 
shipmen who may be in this port for the purpose of instruc- 
tion, for the annual sum of $600. The College will provide 
Mathematical instruction for any number of midshipmen 
not exceeding forty-five, divided into three classes accord- 
ing to their progress, for the additional sum of $800 per 
annum.” Admission to the public lectures given by these 
departments in addition to the regular exercises may be 
had by “all the officers of the Navy who may be upon 
this station, for the annual sum of $600.” A Professor- 
ship will be formed in favor of “a gentleman, the most 
competent as an astronomical observer of any in this 
country ” and “an cbservatory sufficient for teaching the 
mode of taking observations erected and furnished with 
instruments; to the benefits of which all officers upon 
the station shall have access for the annual sum of $1500. 
These different courses of instruction, which it is believed, 
would supersede the necessity of a Naval school, are 
therefore tendered to the government for the annual sum, 
in all, of $3500.” Commodore Chauncey, while preferring 
“a naval school if established upon a liberal footing,” 
recommended to the Department to accept the proposal 
made by the College. There appears to have been no 
result from this proposition. 
Determined to neglect no means of commending the 
College to the support of the public, the Trustees pro- 
posed (February 8, 1880) to the Corporation of the City 
of New York : — 
“That if the Corporation of the City of New York 
should patronize Columbia College as the City College, 
the Trustees pledge themselves to ordain, that the Mayor 
   
-P-A-G-E-160
    
   
                                                            
    
     
   116 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1830 and Recorder shall be ez officio members of the Board of 
Trustees of the College. That for every $20,000 in 
money, or in real estate, granted or conveyed to the said 
Trustees for the use of the College, by any individuals, 
or any society, or body corporate, in the said City, the 
Corporation of the said City shall have the right to 
appoint one Trustee of the said College, until the num- 
ber of Trustees, so appointed, shall equal, with the Mayor 
and Recorder, the present number of Trustees. Vacancies 
in the number of these Trustees shall forever be filled by 
the Corporation of the City. Vacancies in the present 
number of the Trustees of the College shall be filled by 
the remaining Trustees of that number and description, 
and their successors in office, and that application shall 
be made to the Legislature of the State for an alteration 
in the Charter of the College, agreeably to the above 
provisions :” “That if the Corporation of the City should 
resolve to appropriate the building called the old Alms- 
house to literary purposes, and should grant the same, 
or an equivalent thereto, to the Trustees of Columbia 
College, the said Corporation shall be immediately entitled 
to appoint Trustees of the College agreeably to the above 
provisions.” 
Though the acceptance of this proposition might, per- 
haps, have aided the College temporarily, it would 
doubtless have embarrassed its future prosperity and 
development by making its management more or less 
dependent upon political fluctuations. The Trustees were, 
therefore, happily unsuccessful in their advances to the 
Corporation of the city. 
The University of the City of New York was opened in 
the fall of 1832. In his report to the Trustees in Janu- 
ary, 1833, President Duer refers to the falling off in the 
number of students as follows: “This decrease both in 
the number of students remaining, of the former year, 
and in the number entering at the opening of the session, 
is principally to be attributed to the recent establishment 
of another institution in the city upon a plan of organiza- 
tion similar to this College. Several of our former students,
-P-A-G-E-161
  
  PRESIDENTS DUER AND MOORE 117 
indeed, applied for their dismissals for the avowed pur- 1838 
pose of entering the University of the City of New York, 
at its opening in October last; and the far greater part 
of the candidates for admission from other schools than . 
the Grammar School of the College, joined the new insti- 
tution, the Grammar School having furnished twenty-five 
of the thirty-two of which the entering class of the present 
year consists.” 
For some years the number of students did not increase. 
Efforts were constantly made by the authorities of the 
College to increase its efficiency and attractiveness, by 
extending the courses, and by diversifying them. The 
expenses therefore increased and the debt grew steadily 
larger. No assistance from the Legislature or other 
sources was obtained, though not infrequent applications 
were made. Ways and means were earnestly and fre- 
quently debated, and some small reductions in the in- 
creasing debt were made by raising the price of tuition 
from $80 to $90 a year, by dispensing with the services 
of some of the less important officers, and by reducing, for 
a short time, the salaries of others. The main reliance of 
the Trustees seemed to be, however, upon the ultimate 
success of their constant endeavors to furnish the best 
possible means of education, and so enlarging the number 
of students, and upon the increasing value of their landed 
property judiciously managed. In 1836 the statutes of 
the College were revised ‘‘and many important altera- 
tions made especially in regard to the courses of study. 
The full course was materially enlarged in all the depart- 
ments, and the Literary and Scientific Course defined and 
extended and placed upon a footing of greater relative 
importance in respect to the full course, with the view of 
rendering it a complete system for the education of young 
men intended for civil or military engineers, architects, 
superintendents of manufactories, or for mercantile or 
nautical pursuits.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
  118 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
To increase the efficiency of the scientific courses, 
$10,000 was appropriated for additions to the Library and 
philosophical apparatus ; a collection of minerals having 
been previously purchased for $2300 and a geological col- 
lection of valuable specimens received from the State. 
On the 13th of April, 1837, was celebrated the semi- 
centennial anniversary of the reconstruction of the Col- 
lege under the Act of the Legislature passed April 13, 
1787. A joint committee appointed by the Trustees, 
alumni, and students made the arrangements. On the day 
set a procession was formed on the College Green at ten 
in the morning, consisting of Trustees, Faculty, alumni, 
and students of the College, Regents of the University, 
public functionaries of the City, State, and Nation, and 
other distinguished guests, and proceeded to St. John’s 
Chapel in Hudson Square. There an oration was delivered 
by the Rev. Dr. Manton Eastburn, of the class of 17, 
then Rector of the Church of the Ascension in New York, 
and afterward Bishop of Massachusetts. A poem written 
for the occasion was recited by William Betts, of the class 
of ’20; a Latin ode, written by William C. Russell, of 
the Class of ’32, and set to music, was sung ; and hono- 
rary degrees were conferred upon William Cullen Bryant 
and other persons distinguished in letters, law, and divinity. 
A Greek ode written by Professor Anthon, of the class 
of °15, was put into the hands of a musical composer, 
with a view to its performance with the other at the cele- 
bration ; but the composer not only failed to compose any 
music, but mislaid the manuscript committed to him, and, 
as no copy had been retained, lost the ode to posterity. 
“In the evening the College Hall and Library, having 
been illuminated and appropriately decorated, were thrown 
open for the reception by the President of the Trustees, 
Faculty, alumni, and students, with other friends of the 
institution, who assembled in great numbers in honour of 
the occasion.”

PRESIDENTS DUER AND MOORE 119 
Professor Anthon, whose Greek ode was lost, subse- 1842 
quently wrote a very humorous description in verse of 
the evening reception, in which each of the Professors is 
represented as singing a song in the language of his de- 
partment and the President as finishing the entertainment 
with a song of enjoyment and farewell. 
In 1838 a large and valuable addition was made to the 
Library by the purchase of Professor N. F. Moore’s col- 
lection, especially rich in classical works. Mr. Moore 
was engaged to put the whole Library in order and 
arrange it for more convenient use. The President of 
the College reported (December 8) that the number of 
students was greater than ever before, there being one 
hundred and forty-six in the “full course” and ten in the 
“literary and scientific course.” 
President Duer became ill in the latter part of 1841 
and resigned his office May 2, 1842. The Trustees ex- 
pressed their high appreciation of his active and efficient 
service and deeply deplored the necessity that led to his 
resignation. They voted him an allowance of $1200 per 
annum during his life and regretted that the “crippled 
state of Finances” prevented them from more fully and 
satisfactorily expressing, in this respect, their sense of 
obligation. Professor McVickar, again as after Dr. 
Harris’s resignation, acted as President till the election 
of a successor, which occurred in the following August 
by the choice of Nathaniel F. Moore, LL.D., of the class 
of 02, Professor in the department of Greek and Latin 
1817-1835. 
At the time of President Duer’s resignation there were 
one hundred and four students in the “full course” and 
three in the “literary and scientific course”; the income 
of the College was $23,998.05, and the expenditures 
$22,865.41 ; the debt of the College was $58,050. 
In June, 1843, Professor Anderson resigned his professor- 
ship and was succeeded by the Rev. Dr. Charles W. Hack- 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
120 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1848 ley, at the time of his election Professor of Astronomy in 
the University of the City of New York, and author of 
mathematical treatises. Professor Anderson was a pro- 
found mathematician, versed also in other sciences, an 
elegant classical scholar, a most accomplished linguist, and 
a professor who commanded the attention and regard of 
his pupils by his character, the extent and variety of his 
attainments, and his dignified and courteous manners. 
“He had frequently visited Europe, and after he resigned 
his Professorship he extended his travels into the far 
East. The expedition under Lieutenant Lynch, sent to 
explore the Jordan and the Dead Sea, found him in that 
quarter, and pressed him into their service as geologist, 
and his valuable report on the Geology of that region was 
printed among the papers of the exploration.”1 He sub- 
sequently rendered valuable service to his alma mater as 
Trustee (1851-1875). He was one of the very able com- 
mittee that revised the whole system of education in the 
College (1857) and put it substantially upon the basis 
upon which it rests to-day and laid down the lines along 
which the College has.since developed. He died in India, 
in 1875, on his return from a private astronomical expe- 
dition to the northern part of that country to observe the 
transit of Venus. 
In April, 1848, the Trustees received notice of a bequest, 
made by Frederick Gebhard of New York City, of $20,000 
“for the endowment of a Professorship of the German 
Language and Literature in the said College and for no 
other purpose whatever.” The bequest was accepted, 
the “Gebhard” Professorship established, and in June, 
J. Louis Tellkampf, J.U.D., of Gottingen, was elected to 
the Chair. Professor Tellkampf was given leave of ab- 
sence, at his own request, to go to Germany, and the salary 
that might accrue during his absence was, also at his own 
request, devoted by him to the purchase of books relating 
1 Professor H. Drisler, May 4, 1894. 
 
-P-A-G-E-167
  PRESIDENTS DUER AND MOORE 121 
to the work of the department, for the Library. He began 1843 
his instruction in April of the following year, the study 
of German having been, meanwhile, made an obligatory 
part of the academic curriculum. In January, 1847, the 
attendance of the two upper classes was made voluntary 
and so continued for ten years, when the study was made 
wholly voluntary. In the fall of 1847, Professor Tellkampf 
resigned and was succeeded by the Rev. Dr. Henry I. 
Schmidt, who continued for a third of a century in the 
active discharge of his duties. 
In July, 1848, the « literary and scientific course” was 
abolished “after the end of the present term.” There 
were no students in it at the time. It was apparently in 
advance of the desires of the community and had never 
received much encouragement. The highest number in it, 
in any one year, was twelve; it was often wholly deserted, 
and for the thirteen years of its existence the total num- 
ber attending it was but forty-nine. Many of its features 
were subsequently i into the curriculum. 
Among the students the literary societies continued 
their activity, and new college associations were introduced 
by the establishment of chapters of Greek letter fraterni- 
ties. In 1836 a chapter of Alpha Delta Phi was formed; 
in 1842 a chapter of Psi Upsilon; in 1843 a chapter of 
Delta Phi; in 1847 a chapter of Delta Psi; and later, 
chapters of others. The fraternities afforded students 
places of meeting outside the College, gave variety, and 
added much to the social side of undergraduate life. 
The finances of the College, always hitherto an anxious 
matter, were at this time subject of especial concern. On 
the report of a committee in July, 1843, the salaries of the 
President and four principal Professors were reduced, so 
that, besides a house and $10 a year for each student 
who paid his fee, the President was to receive a salary 
of $1400, and each of the four principal Professors, $1200; 
no Adjunct Professor of Languages was to be appointed
-P-A-G-E-168
  122 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1843 to the place of Adjunct Professor Vermilye, who had re- 
signed; the President was to instruct the Senior Class in 
classics, the Jay Professor, Dr. Anthon, taking charge of 
the Freshmen, who had hitherto been taught by the Ad- 
junct Professor. The salary of the Treasurer was reduced 
to $400; the annual expense for printing was limited to 
$50, and for the Library was not to exceed $100; the sys- 
tem of prize medals was abolished, as well as the liter- 
ary and scientific course. The President was authorized 
to employ, if necessary, an additional instructor in the 
classics for the first term of the next academic year at an 
expense not exceeding $200 —and so, by appointment of 
the President, Henry Drisler, of the class of ’89, began 
a connection with the College destined to be prolonged 
and distinguished. President Moore’s instruction of the 
senior class in Greek was but of short duration, as in 
February, 1844, he begged to be excused from that service, 
and was excused, for the reason given by him “that he, 
under conviction of expediency, a number of years ago 
adopted the modern Grecian pronunciation of the Greek 
language, and therefore finds himself unable to be intelli- 
gible, profitable or interesting to his class.”

CHAPTER -XI 
1849-1864 
PRESIDENT CHARLES KING 
In the fall of 1849 Dr. Moore retired from the presi- 
dency and was succeeded by Charles King, a gentleman 
of note in the city, a son of the Hon. Rufus King, who 
had been a valuable Trustee of the College (1806-1824). 
His accession was “ widely hailed on the peculiar score 
of being a public and a business man, opening thereby a 
new sphere of popular influence, and creating a new bond 
of sympathy between the College and the needs and wants 
of our great commercial Metropolis.” 1 Great and bene- 
ficial changes occurred during President King’s incum- 
bency of his office. 
In his report to the Trustees on December 1, 1845, 
President Moore said: “The general state of the College 
may be regarded as encouraging. The Institution is 
beginning to see its path clear of the financial difficulties 
that have so long obstructed it.” Yet the College debt 
became steadily larger. From a report of the Standing 
Committee of the Trustees, made February 4, 1850, it ap- 
pears that this debt will be found to have grown within 
seventeen years last past from $30,000 to the sum of 
$68,000, being an average annual expenditure, during 
that period, of more than $2200 beyond the College in- 
come. The hopes of the Trustees for relief seem to have 
been based upon the prospective increase in the value of 
the “ Botanical Garden” property, heretofore referred to, 
which “consists of about two hundred and sixty Lots of 
1 Professor McVickar’s address at the inauguration of President King, 
November 28, 1849. 
123

1850 ground and is bounded on the North by 51st Street, on 
the South by 47th Street, on the East by Fifth Avenue and 
on the West by a line parallel with and about one hun- 
dred feet easterly of the Sixth Avenue.” A special com- 
mittee appointed to consider and report upon the state 
of the College, the expediency of selling a portion, at 
least, of the “ Botanic Garden,” the question of permanency 
in the location of the College, and other matters connected 
with the finances of the College, reported April 1, 1850, 
against any immediate sale, and said, “the present period, 
from various causes, is marked by great buoyancy in the 
value of real estate as well as in every department of 
trade, and the future appears to promise a decided and 
rapid increase. It is but very recently, and within the 
last few months, that this impulse has been sensibly appar- 
ent, and the causes that produced it, combined with the 
rapid and steady growth of our population, can hardly 
fail to secure the property in question from becoming, at - 
any future time, less available than at present, and give 
the most encouraging assurances that it will gradually 
and steadily improve.” The Committee further reported, 
“in regard to the permanency of location,” “it does not 
appear to the Committee that any circumstances at present 
exist, or are likely soon to arise, making a change expe- 
dient.” ‘The Committee was wiser in its estimate of the 
increasing value of the property than in its opinion upon 
“the permanency of location.” The brightening financial 
prospects encouraged the introduction of propositions for 
the enlargement of the curriculum, the extension of its 
benefits more widely, and the popularization of the College. 
The expediency of allowing the alumni of the College, in 
case of a vacancy in the Board of Trustees, to nominate 
three candidates to fill the vacancy, one of whom must 
be chosen, was considered and abandoned (June, 1850), 
as it would involve an alteration of the Charter. 
President King suggested the establishment of a Chair  
-P-A-G-E-173
  
  PRESIDENT CHARLES KING 125 
of American History (September, 1850), which was con- 1852 
sidered, but not then carried into effect. In February, 
1851, a committee, in reporting upon the advance in the 
value upon the College property, and the prospective easy 
management of its debt, directs the attention of the Trus- 
tees “to the possibility, at least, of the removal of the 
College to that place” (é.e. the “Botanic Garden”). 
In October, 1852, on motion of President King, a com- 
mittee was appointed to consider and report upon “ the 
expediency of abolishing the fees for tuition in this Col- 
lege, and of making it free to all who can undergo the 
preliminary examination,” and also upon “the expediency 
of engrafting upon the foundation of this College a scheme 
of University Professorships and lectures in the higher 
departments of Letters and Science.” Other propositions 
were made from time to time, and in October, 1853, a 
Committee appointed to consider the subject of the Pro- 
fessorship of Natural and Experimental Philosophy and 
Chemistry, for the relief of the Professor, recommended 
that “no action be had in reference to this Professorship 
solely,” on the ground that any change made then could 
be but partial, as the removal of the College would prob- 
ably be “determined on at an early day,” and “that when 
that period shall have arrived, among the subjects to be 
considered necessarily connected with the place, plan, and 
extent of the College buildings, is the scheme of collegiate 
instruction proper thereafter to be adopted, and that then, 
the course of instruction now pursued must be radically 
altered.” The Committee continued : ‘“‘ Therefore, before 
finally resolving upon, or even considering, the question 
of removal, the Board ought to have the materials for an 
enlightened judgment upon the more important points 
indicated above. The consideration of these points, from 
the intrinsic importance, extent and difficulty of the 
subject, will necessarily require the most careful and 
deliberate inquiry, which can only be made by a Com-
-P-A-G-E-174
  
126 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1853 mittee composed of such members of the Board as are best 
qualified for the task.” The Committee recommended 
the passage of the following resolution, which, as it pro- 
duced great results, is here given in full : — 
“Resolved, that it be referred to a Committee of Three 
to be elected by ballot to inquire, whether it is expedient 
to take any and what measures for the removal of the 
seat of the College; and in the event of such removal, 
whether any and what changes ought to be made in the 
undergraduate course ; and whether it would be expedi- 
ent to establish a system of University Education in addi- 
tion to such undergraduate course, either in continuation 
thereof or otherwise. That such Committee report fully 
as to the principles and details of any plan that they may 
recommend, and whether in their opinion it can be suc- 
cessfully carried into execution ; and in connection there- 
with, that they consider whether, for the more effectual 
carrying out such plan and extending the benefit of this 
institution, it ought to afford rooms and commons, or rooms 
alone, for resident students, and ought to have its seat 
isolated.” 
The resolution was adopted, and the Committee chosen, 
which was briefly called the Committee on the College 
Course, consisted of William Betts, LL.D., Dr. Henry 
James Anderson, and the Hon. Hamilton Fish. 
The Committee reported progress at the next meeting of 
the Board in November. In this preliminary report the 
Committee recommended the immediate removal of the 
College. Efforts were made to carry out the recommen- 
dation, but without success. The report stated that in 
the opinion of the Committee, moral and intellectual disci- 
pline was the object of collegiate education, and that “the 
mere acquisition of learning, however valuable and desir- 
able in itself, is subordinate to this great work,” and that 
this view of the subject would govern the Committee in 
its inquiries. “ We cannot, however, conceal from our- 
selves,” continue the Committee, “ that, however manifestly
-P-A-G-E-175
  
    PRESIDENT CHARLES KING 127 
just this sentiment may seem to us, it does not meet with 1853 
universal sympathy or acquiescence. On the contrary, 
the demand for what is termed Progressive Knowledge so 
loudly uttered, and for fuller instruction in what are called 
useful and practical sciences, is at variance with this fun- 
damental idea. The public generally, unaccustomed to 
look upon the mind except in connection with the body, 
and used to regard it as a machine for promoting the 
pleasures, the conveniences, or the comforts of the latter, 
will not be satisfied with a system of education in which 
they are unable to perceive the direct connection between 
the knowledge imparted and the bodily advantages to be 
gained. For this reason, to preserve in some degree high © 
and pure education and strict mental discipline, and to 
draw as many as possible within its influence, we must 
partially yield to those sentiments which we should be 
unable wholly to resist. Your committee therefore think 
that while they would retain the system having in view 
the most perfect intellectual training, they might devise 
parallel courses, having this design at their foundation, 
but still adapted to meet the popular demand.” With 
regard to the establishment of a University system in ad- 
dition to the undergraduate course, the Committee “ were 
not prepared to say more than that they regarded it favor- 
ably in those respects in which it might be practicable; 
but that the design was not free from serious difficulties, 
that the subject had occupied the minds of learned men 
in connection with the English Universities, but hitherto 
without effect; that the Medical and Theological Schools 
had done much, perhaps all, that could at present be done 
in that direction; but in regard to higher jurisprudence, 
and the sciences and their applications, much might pos- 
sibly be done by the College.” There the matter was left 
for the time for the consideration of the Trustees and 
for suggestions from the Faculty, both of which were 
invited. 
 
-P-A-G-E-176
  128 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1853 On November 21, 1853, Professor Renwick’s resigna- 
tion, which had been offered some time previously, was 
finally accepted with an expression on the part of the 
Trustees of ‘their just appreciation of his “ long-tried, 
eminent and faithful services in the cause of science and 
sound instruction.” That they might testify, in a suitable 
manner, their sense of his merits, the Trustees created an 
order of Emeritus Professorships, without salaries or stated 
duties, but with certain privileges and honors, and Dr. 
Renwick was made Emeritus Professor of Natural and 
Experimental Philosophy and Chemistry. He was in- 
vited to sit for his portrait, which was to be provided at 
the expense of the College and to be hung in the Library | 
or other suitable room in one of the College edifices. 
Professor Renwick lived for ten years after this to enjoy 
the honors that his merits had acquired and died aged 
seventy-one years in January, 1863. In a minute upon 
his death, the Faculty of the College speak of his active 
labors in his Professorship “ for the long period of thirty- 
three years, those labours diversified yet increased by 
occasional demands, during the summer vacations, by 
Government for the aid of his acknowledged skill and 
science. Among the most honorable of such duties, as 
well as perilous, was his appointment by the General Gov- 
ernment in 1838 as Commissioner for the survey of the 
northeastern boundary.” The Faculty say further, 
“ Zeal for science was with him ever uppermost, and in 
various public duties, more especially as connected with 
the safety of steam, and in the advancement of private 
associations of science, becoming in some the presiding, 
and in all an influential manager, Professor Renwick con- 
tinued both active and useful up to the very day of the 
fatal attack under which he sank.” 
The choice of a successor to Professor Renwick proved 
to be a very serious matter. The controversy to which 
it gave rise became somewhat warm and bitter, involved  
-P-A-G-E-177
  
PRESIDENT CHARLES KING 129 
not only the Trustees but the alumni, and was discussed 1854 
not without acrimony in the public press. It prevented 
the celebration, which had been proposed, of the centen- 
nial anniversary of the founding of the College in 1754, 
and culminated in the appointment by the Senate of the 
State of New York of a select Committee of Three, of its 
own body, “to inquire whether Columbia College or any 
of its Trustees have violated any provision of Law or of 
its Charter; and particularly whether said College or 
any of its Trustees have in any way required any, and if 
_ any what, religious qualifications or test, from any candi- 
date as a condition of appointment to any Professorship 
in said College.” As a result of the inquiries the Com- 
mittee “arrived at the clear and decided conclusion, that 
there had been no such violation ; and the College was 
to be left in the full enjoyment of all its chartered rights 
and immunities, without any attempt to interfere in their 
lawful exercise.” Meanwhile, on April 3, 1854, Mr. 
Richard S. McCulloh, then Professor of Physics and 
Chemistry in the College of New Jersey, had been chosen 
to fill the vacant chair. 
On the 24th of July, 1854, the Committee on the Col- 
lege Course, to which had been added the Rev. Dr. John 
Knox, made a full report upon all the subjects committed 
to them, recommended a plan, and set forth fully the 
principles that had guided them in preparing it. 
The resources of the College were not sufficient to put 
into immediate effect any scheme of expansion, and the 
matter was allowed to rest, to be examined and criticised, 
amended and improved, till the time became ripe for ac- 
tion. This time arrived in 1857. 
In 1855 a special Committee of Trustees on buildings 
was appointed. This Committee, with the assistance of 
Mr. Richard Upjohn, the architect engaged, developed 
plans for edifices on the “Botanic Garden” property. 
By resolution of the Trustees adopted June 19, 1856, the 
K 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
  130 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1856 Committee was authorized to proceed to the erection of 
one of the buildings shown on the plan submitted and 
“covering a length of two hundred and eighty feet, or 
such part thereof as may be deemed expedient by the 
Committee.” The Committee did not, however, act upon 
this authority, as the College purchased, in the fall of 
1856, of the Deaf and Dumb Asylum, a part of the block 
of land between 49th and 50th streets, Madison and 
Fourth avenues, with the buildings thereon. The whole 
of the block was subsequently acquired. The buildings 
were put in order for the temporary use of the College, 
and the scheme for erecting permanent buildings on the 
College property, Fifth Avenue between 49th and 50th 
streets, was held in abeyance and ultimately abandoned. 
In January, 1857, a part of the site of the College 
buildings in Park Place was sold, and the necessity for 
speedy removal became imperative. The Committee on 
the College Course were instructed “to bring in the full 
statute to comprehend the whole scheme of College and 
University instruction contemplated by their former 
report.” The full statute was reported on the 2d of 
March. It was considered and amended at subsequent 
meetings, and finally adopted July 6, 1857. 
Before this action, however, the College had been re- 
moved from its original site in Park Place to the “tem- 
porary” location, that it subsequently occupied for forty 
years, at 49th Street and Madison Avenue. The removal 
appears to have been a very simple affair. The following 
account is from the Evening Post of May 7, 1857 : — 
“COLUMBIA COLLEGE.— The exercises in Columbia 
College were concluded in the old building, to be re- 
sumed Tuesday next at the buildings in 49th Street near 
the Fourth Avenue, until permanently located in the new 
edifice, proposed to be erected in the Fifth Avenue near 
50th Street. At the close of the Chapel exercises, Presi- 
dent King briefly addressed the students, exhorting them,
-P-A-G-E-179
PRESIDENT CHARLES KING 181 
wherever they went, to carry the good and leave the bad 1857 
behind —to go to the new locality with a clean record, and 
to preserve it clean. At the close of the President’s re- 
marks, a farewell song, written for the occasion by John 
Ward, of the junior class, was sung to the tune of Auld 
Lang Syne. : 
“In the course of the day the corner-stone of the. Col- 
lege building was disinterred. It is a solid block of red 
sandstone, measuring three feet in length, one foot in 
depth and one foot in thickness. The letters of the in- 
scription are as fresh and sharp as the day they were cut. 
It was buried about six feet under ground, on the South- 
east corner of the old College building.” 
(The “corner-stone” was embedded in the east wall of 
the College Chapel at 49th Street and there remained till 
removed in 1897 and inserted in the mantelpiece of the 
Trustees’ Room in the University Library on Morning- 
side Heights. ) 
The New York Herald of May 4, 1857, refers to the 
same subject : — 
“By the terms of the sale the buyers of the Columbia 
College property cannot claim possession before the tenth 
of May, but the Faculty have been actively engaged for 
some time in getting ready for the removal. The Library 
books, cabinet minerals and portable property of the Col- 
lege have all been packed and removed to the old Deaf 
and Dumb Asylum in 50th Street, near Fourth Avenue, 
which will be used hereafter as the College, until the new 
edifice destined for the use of the students and Faculty is 
erected on the College property in Fifth Avenue. 
“The old Asylum has been completely refitted, and ac- 
commodations have been provided for the President and 
one of the Professors, with their families, in the building. 
Should these new quarters prove acceptable to the stu- 
dents, a lease of ten years will be taken, by which time 
the new College will be ready for occupancy. The old 
building on Park Place was put up in 1758, and this week 
the work of demolition will commence.” (No “lease” 
was to be taken, as the College acquired the property in 
fee.) 
 
-P-A-G-E-180
  132 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
The distance of the new location from the well-settled 
portions of the city and the difficulty of access were so 
considerable that the Treasurer and the President of the 
College were (April 22) appointed “a Committee to con- 
fer with the Direction or the officers of the Harlem and 
other Rail Road Companies, and with the Proprietors of 
any line or lines of Omnibuses, with a view to the estab- 
lishment of suitable facilities for the conveyance of stu- 
dents and others to and from the new College, and for 
the arrangement of a price for such conveyance either 
by commutation or for each trip.” 
At the time referred to and for years afterward, Madi- 
son Avenue was not paved above 42d Street and was not 
open above 49th Street; “the bones of the unknown 
dead ” were removed from “ Potters Field ” in the vicinity 
during the summer and fall of 1858; there was no way of 
getting across the railroad tracks on Fourth Avenue but 
by crossing on the level; Bull’s Head cattle yards were on 
Fifth Avenue, east side, just below the present site of the 
Windsor Hotel; and the region about was as “new” as 
these remarks would lead one to infer. 
The demolition of the buildings in Park Place was begun 
as soon as the College vacated them and was rapidly 
effected. The following extract from the Evening Post 
of May 11, 1857, notes the destruction of the old building 
and the transfer to the new, and gives some account of the 
“new location” as it then appeared. 
“ CoLuMBIA CoLLEGE.— The old College building in 
Park Place is now entirely destroyed, and this morning 
a force of workmen were employed in tearing off the roof 
and undermining the walls. The transfer to the new 
College building, between 49th and 50th streets (formerly 
the Deaf and Dumb Asylum) was made without public 
display, —a procession, addresses, and other doings were 
talked of, but abandoned from various considerations. 
This morning the various classes assembled at the new 
buildings, but as the work of repairing and refitting is not

yet completed there were no recitations. There will be 1857 
some inauguration ceremonies in recommencing the Col- 
lege exercises to-morrow forenoon, when the Protestant 
Episcopal Bishop of the Diocese is expected to be present, 
and there may possibly be an address from an ex-Professor, 
who is a member of the Board of Trustees. 
“The new location of the College is a delightful one, 
and undesirable only on account of the distance uptown — 
an objection which, by the tendency of population, will be 
in a few years obviated. The old Asylum buildings have 
been altered somewhat, repaired, and greatly improved. 
The two wings have been separated from the main build- 
ing. The east wing is occupied by the Chapel and the 
extensive Library of the College; the centre for the recita- 
tion rooms and the residence of President King; and the 
west wing for the residences of some of the College Pro- 
fessors. A beautiful lawn slopes from the College 
southward down to 49th Street, and is ornamented by 
some fine old trees. This will be for the present the main 
entrance to the College, but as soon as the more extensive 
grounds northward to 50th Street can be graded, laid out, 
and properly embellished, the principal entrance will be 
in that direction. The site is on a commanding emi- 
nence, affording an extensive and pleasant view. That 
part of the city is still quite new, and the hand of im- 
provement is visible in all directions. ‘Potters Field’ 
is within a stone’s throw, and we are sorry to say the ends 
of rows of coffins, filled with the bones of the unknown 
dead, are still to be seen protruding from the bank of 
earth left by the cutting through of the Fourth Avenue. 
The College will probably remain in its present location 
only six or eight years, or until the new College buildings 
to be erected by the Trustees shall be completed.” 
The “inauguration ceremonies ” consisted, according to 
a contemporary account, of the assemblage of the students 
in the Chapel for morning prayers: the Chaplain, the 
Rev. Mr. Duffie, read the third chapter of Proverbs; Mr. 
Walter presided at the organ and the students chanted 
the seventy-ninth selection of Psalms ; the Rev. Dr. Knox, 
Chairman of the Trustees, made an address, in which he
-P-A-G-E-184
  134 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1857 impressed upon the students that the increased facilities 
for study increased also their responsibilities, and that 
they must not fail to improve these newly created oppor- 
tunities; President King also made an address; after 
which the students proceeded to their respective lecture 
rooms. “Their course of lectures will now continue. 
Extensive preparations are now being made to beautify 
and ornament the grounds around the College, and it only 
remains for 50th Street to be properly regulated to add to 
the fair prospect of this most noble and worthy institution.” 
The statute that was adopted in July, 1857, and which 
was to be put into effect, so far as practicable, at the 
beginning of the next academic year, continued, in sub- 
stance, the former collegiate curriculum to the end of the 
junior year, with adaptations, however, to the future stud- 
ies, both subgraduate and postgraduate. Beginning with 
the senior year the statute provided that the course should 
be divided into three departments, any one of which might 
be elected by the students entering upon that year, viz.: 
a “Department of Letters,” which was a highly classical 
and literary course; a “ Department of Science,” in which 
predominance was given to courses in science, as Mechanics 
and Physics, Astronomy, Chemistry, Engineering, Mining, 
etc.; and a “Department of Jurisprudence,” in which 
Modern History, Political Economy, Natural and Inter- 
national Law, and allied subjects, were given promi- 
nence. Prize scholarships were to be established in the 
subgraduate course under proper regulations and a“ Uni- 
yersity Course of Study” was provided. 
When the state of education throughout the country 
at that time, nearly fifty years ago, is considered, this 
statute shows great knowledge, foresight, and wisdom. In 
a public address upon the changes in and enlargement of 
the course of studies, Mr. Betts, the Chairman of the Com- 
mittee of Trustees that prepared the statute, says, among 
other things : —
-P-A-G-E-185
  
PRESIDENT CHARLES KING 135 
“Up to this point of College life [the close of junior 1857 
year] the end in view is mainly to discipline and invigo- 
rate the mind, and to enlighten and purify the heart. 
Now, the object is to apply this intellectual light and vigor 
to the permanent acquisition of knowledge; to emancipate 
the student gradually from the trammels of catechetical 
teaching, and to prepare him for the higher and more 
arduous efforts of self-instruction. With this view, three 
departments are constructed, which are termed Schools 
of Letters, of Science, and of Jurisprudence; the first of 
which has reference to general improvement; the two 
latter to specific objects, as indicated by their names. 
On entering the senior year, each student may select 
either of these schools. Should he neglect to make a 
selection, he continues in the Classical or School of 
Letters.” 
The tuition fee was reduced to $50. The existing Pro- 
fessorships in the College were subdivided, and several 
additions were made to the Faculty. 
The Professorship of the Greek and Latin Languages 
was subdivided into two— the Professorship of the Greek 
Languages and Literature, which Dr. Anthon assumed, 
and the Professorship of the Latin Language and Litera- 
ture, to which Mr. Henry Drisler, of the class of ’89, 
who had been appointed Tutor in Greek and Latin in 
1848, and Adjunct Professor in 1845, was promoted. Dr. 
MeVickar’s extensive duties were apportioned among three 
chairs—that of the Evidences of Natural and Revealed 
Religion, to which the Professor himself was assigned; 
that of Moral and Intellectual Philosophy and Literature, 
which was filled by the election of Charles Murray Nairne, 
A.M., a graduate of the Universities of Aberdeen and 
Edinburgh, a ripe scholar; and a Chair of History and 
Political Science, to which Francis Lieber, LL.D., the 
distinguished philosophic historian, was elected. The 
department of Mathematics and Astronomy was divided, 
and Professor Hackley assumed the Chair of Astronomy, 
and Charles Davies, LL.D., a graduate of the United 
 
-P-A-G-E-186
  136 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1857 States Military Academy at West Point, and author of 
a well-known series of mathematical text-books, was made 
Professor of Mathematics, with Mr. William Guy Peck, 
his son-in-law, also a graduate of West Point and a suc- 
cessful mathematical writer, as an assistant. The subjects 
of Physics and Chemistry were separated; Professor Mc- 
Culloh was to confine himself to the department of Physics 
and Mechanics, and Charles A. Joy, Ph.D., who had re- 
ceived his scientific education and his degree of Doctor of 
Philosophy in Germany, was made Professor of Chem- 
istry. Other chairs were projected ‘i not established. 
The effect of these changes was to extend and 
strengthen the course of instruction and to attract a 
larger number of students. President King reported to 
the Trustees that, on opening in the fall of 1857 at the 
“new site, a greater number of students matriculated 
than ever before in the history of the College”; and 
when it is found that the number that called forth this 
note of exultation was but one hundred and fifty-four, the 
difference between that day and this is strikingly appar- 
ent. Of the electives open for the first time to the mem- 
bers of the senior class, that class (twenty-six in number) 
divided themselves as follows—fourteen in the ‘“ School 
of Letters,” and six each in the Schools of Jurisprudence 
and Science. The alumni of the College were awakened 
to greater interest. They sent, through the officers of 
their Association, a communication to the Trustees, ex- 
pressing a desire for a conference, to consider propositions 
for the benefit of the College, and their intention to estab- 
lish a prize to promote general excellence in scholarship. 
They established an annual prize of $50 “to the most 
faithful and deserving student of the graduating class,” 
the Faculty to submit the names of three candidates 
to the class, who should select one of them to receive the 
prize. This prize was first awarded at Commencement in 
1858, and has been awarded annually ever since. 
 
-P-A-G-E-187
PRESIDENT CHARLES KING 137 
The Civil War broke out in the spring of 1861. On 1861 
the call of the government for troops, a number of the 
students in the College went to the front. Those who 
were members of the class of ’61 received their degrees 
at the following Commencement: others subsequently 
rejoined the College and were graduated with their re- 
spective classes : still others abandoned the course for an 
academic degree and remained in the field. Many of the 
alumni of the College served in the army, some of them 
with marked distinction, as Philip Kearny, of the class 
of ’83, the brilliant officer who lost his life at Chantilly 
in 1862, and all of them with a devotion worthy of the 
ancient days of the College. Professor Lieber was a not 
infrequent adviser of the Secretary of War. A minute of 
the Trustees, December 8, 1862, states: “The Secretary 
of War of the United States, having requested the presence 
of Francis Lieber at Washington for a month or more, it 
was Resolved, That leave of absence be given to Professor 
Lieber until the Fifth of January next.” He was often 
in consultation with Secretary Stanton, though not absent 
from the College for so considerable a time as that just 
referred to. 
In the latter part of April, 1861, there was a flag-raising 
on the grounds in front of the old College building on 
49th Street. There was a large gathering of officers, 
students, and their friends. Major Robert Anderson of 
the United States Army, who had recently returned from 
participation in the first act of the War at Fort Sumter, 
South Carolina, raised the flag to the top of the staff and, 
as it went aloft, exclaimed in a tone that thrilled all who 
heard him, “God bless that flag!” The Hon. Hamilton 
Fish, Chairman of the Trustees and subsequently Secre- 
tary of State of the United States under President Grant, 
made an inspiriting address. Professor Lieber wrote 
for the occasion a song or hymn, on our Country and her 
Flag, which he called Freeland, and which was sung by 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
138 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1863 all present. Addresses were also made by several of the 
College officers. During the whole period of the war, 
excitement ran high, in the College as elsewhere. Many 
interruptions of the exercises necessarily occurred. In 
times of victory there were thanksgivings, and in periods 
of defeat there were days of humiliation. The careers of 
the students and alumni in the army were watched with 
great interest. The distinction of any of them for service 
in the field was a matter of rejoicing, and the death of 
any in battle or from exposure was severely felt. It is 
difficult at this time for any one, impossible for one who 
did not then experience it, to realize the intensity of per- 
sonal interest and feeling that attached to every event of 
the war. 
The early summer of 1863 was a period of great depres- 
sion. The Union armies had not met with success, and a 
pall of gloom settled upon the community. The draft 
riots, a formidable uprising of the unpatriotic, ignorant, 
and vicious classes in the city, occurred in July. Angry 
mobs surged through the streets. The College buildings 
and other property were threatened with destruction. 
Two fire companies in the neighborhood, the Liberty Hook 
and Ladder Company, No. 16, and the relief Hose Com- 
pany, No. 51, voluntarily took upon themselves the office 
of protectors and patrolled the streets till all danger was 
past. They refused any pecuniary compensation for 
their services on the ground that they were simply doing 
their duty as citizens and good neighbors, and were, of 
course, warmly commended and thanked for their high- 
minded conduct. An incident of the time was the 
retirement, in the fall of 1863, of the Professor of Physics 
to participate actively in the conflict. On his retirement, 
the course of instruction was somewhat modified by chang- 
ing the mode of instruction in Physics ; by making the 
higher Mathematics elective, instead of required, for 
members of the senior class; by reducing the required 
 
-P-A-G-E-189
PRESIDENT CHARLES KING 139 
attendance in Mathematics of the junior class from 1864 
five hours a week to three, and adding the time thus 
gained to the attendance in Latin and Greek ; by reduc- 
ing the time given to pure Metaphysics and proportion- 
ately increasing that given to the History of Modern 
Literature and to Moral and Intellectual Philosophy. On 
December 21, 1863, Ogden N. Rood, a graduate of the 
College of New Jersey, a well-known physicist who be- 
came renowned, was elected to the vacant chair of Physics. 
The war diminished, for a time, the available resources 
of the College. The leasing of property, which had been 
improved at great expense, was made difficult and, for 
a time, impracticable, and the burden of taxation was 
increased. Expansion on the lines laid down and to the 
extent anticipated was necessarily deferred. An impor- 
tant enlargement was made, however, in the midst of the 
troubled and anxious times that prevailed, in the establish- 
ment of a School of Mines and Metallurgy. 
On the 7th of March, 1864, President King resigned 
and his resignation was accepted to take effect at the 
close of the Commencement exercises, June 29. The 
Trustees, in accepting his resignation, state that “The 
Presidential term of Dr. King has been distinguished by 
the removal of Columbia College to its present superior 
site, by much development and expansion of its educa- 
tional system and by very considerable enlargement of its 
means and appliances for instruction, an increase in the 
number of students, and a consequent augmentation of 
its importance and influence,” and express their “ grateful 
sense of the earnestness with which he has labored to 
promote the best interests of the institution under his 
charge.” At the Commencement in 1864 he delivered his 
farewell address and presented his successor as President 
of Columbia College.

CHAPTER XII 
1864-1889 
  PRESIDENT FREDERICK A. P. BARNARD 
On Wednesday, the eighteenth day of May, 1864, 
Frederick A. P. Barnard, S.T.D., LL.D., a graduate 
of Yale College of the class of ’28, sometime Chancellor 
of the University of Mississippi, a man of varied and 
profound learning, of large experience and distinction in 
educational matters, was chosen President, the tenth of 
the line. His formal inauguration occurred on the third 
of the following October. 
Dr. Barnard’s election to the presidency came at a time 
opportune for him and for the College. He had thought 
profoundly upon the problems that demanded solution in 
College education, its modification as then practised, its 
extension and diversification, and its prolongation into 
fields of research —and found himself at the head of an 
institution eagerly groping for light on the very topics 
that had engrossed his attention. He was a devoted 
scientist, and a clergyman of the Episcopal Church. At 
the time of his installation the so-called conflict between 
religion and science was urged, denied, and warmly dis- 
cussed. This and the projected School of Mines and 
Metallurgy, which was soon to be put into active opera- 
tion, led him to take for his inaugural discourse the 
theme, “The Relation of Physical Science to Revealed 
Religion.” The “conflict” has so completely subsided 
that the considerations he then presented seem now some- 
what trite and stale —but they were fresh and pertinent 
then, were eloquently urged, and did their share in bring-

PRESIDENT FREDERICK A. P. BARNARD 141 
On his accession he found a good small College, strug- 1864 
gling to make itself larger and better. It had, after long 
and careful deliberation, determined the principles, and 
settled the outlines, of its future development; but the 
time and the manner of accomplishing its desires, the in- 
numerable details of the plan resolved upon, were, for the 
next twenty-five years, to engage the thought and employ 
the activities of Trustees and Faculties alike. Dr. Bar- 
nard soon assumed the leadership. The steps taken were 
sometimes fluctuating, aside or backward, but the general 
movement was forward. Truths that have become axioms 
in educational theory and practice were then but dimly 
seen, seen not at all, or subjects of heated dispute. 
He actively supported the School of Mines and success- 
fully urged the Trustees to become wholly responsible for 
it. In the new, enlarged, and fruitful field of labor in 
which he found himself, he worked incessantly and ex- 
perimented boldly. He changed his own ideas as to the 
relative importance of studies, the best means of expansion, 
as to the amount of freedom proper to students in their 
conduct and in their choice of elective courses, and in 
other particulars — but in all the changes he had a dis- 
tinct end in view and adapted himself to the necessary 
means to attain it. His series of annual reports show the 
gradual growth of his ideas and their modifications, and 
constitute a valuable contribution to knowledge in educa- 
tional matters. 
In September, 1864, Dr. John McVickar, after forty- 
seven years of active service, during which he was twice 
acting President, retired and became Emeritus Professor. 
He had been Professor of Moral and Intellectual Philoso- 
phy, Rhetoric, Belles-lettres, and Political Economy till 
the removal of the College, in 1857, when he was trans- 
ferred to the Chair of the Evidences of Natural and 
Revealed Religion. His learning was extensive and ac- 
curate, and his character was such as to inspire respect

1867 and veneration and to endear him to all who knew him. 
When he retired, many old and distinguished alumni, who 
had been his pupils, attended the celebration held at the 
College grounds in his honor, to pay him their tribute of 
respect and affection. He died in 1868. 
In February, 1866, a Chair of Geology and Paleontology 
was established, and was filled, May 7, by the election 
of Dr. John Strong Newberry, the eminent geologist and 
prolific scientific writer, upon whom subsequently the 
Geological Society of London conferred the Murchison 
gold medal awarded for distinguished scientific services 
in Geology. 
In the fall of 1867 Dr. Charles Anthon, whose name 
holds a distinguished place in the history of the progress 
of classical literature in this country, and whose fame as 
teacher and expositor was high in Europe as well as in 
America, died after forty-seven years of continuous ser- 
vice as Professor. 
Professor Drisler was transferred to the department of 
Greek, as Jay Professor, and Dr. Charles Short, a graduate 
of Harvard University, and sometime President of Ken- 
yon College, Ohio, was made Professor of Latin. 
Shortly after Dr. Anthon’s death the Trustees estab- 
lished in his memory two prizes in Greek, of the respective 
values of #300 and $150, to be competed for by members 
of the junior class, through examination in an entire 
play of Aschylus, Sophocles, or Euripides, not read in the 
College course. In 1880 these prizes were discontinued. 
In 1871 two fellowships in literature and science were 
instituted, open for competition, upon certain conditions, 
to the graduating class, each of the annual value of $500, 
to be held for three years; and, at the same time, six 
scholarships in Classics and Mathematics were established 
in the freshman and sophomore classes, and the like 
number in the junior class in Latin, in Logic, and Eng- 
lish Literature, in History and Rhetoric, in Chemistry, in  
-P-A-G-E-195
  
PRESIDENT FREDERICK A. P. BARNARD 143 
Mechanics, and in Physics. Subsequently this scheme 1872 
was remodelled by adding in the freshman class a schol- 
arship in Rhetoric, by transferring from the junior class 
to the sophomore the scholarship in Chemistry, by adding 
in the junior class a scholarship in Greek, and by so ar- 
ranging the whole as to make fourteen instead of twelve, 
each of the annual value of $100. In 1878 it was pro- 
vided that the fellowships should be conferred annually 
by the Trustees on the written recommendation of the 
Faculty. 
In 1872 Dr. Francis Lieber, the great publicist, writer 
on Public Law and Political Science, philosophical histo- 
rian and teacher, died, aged seventy-two years. No suc- 
cessor to him was appointed. Four years later the chair 
which he filled was replaced by one of History, Political 
Science, and International Law, to which was elected 
Professor John W. Burgess, a graduate of Amherst Col- 
lege, Massachusetts, of the class of ’67, and at the time 
of his selection, Professor of History and Political Science 
at Amherst. 
In 1878 two prizes in Rhetoric and English Composi- 
tion, of $100 and $50 respectively, were established, to be 
competed for by written theses at the end of the senior 
year. In 1880 these prizes were discontinued. 
In 1877 Mr. John Jones Schermerhorn, an alumnus of 
the College of the class of ’25, bequeathed $5000 to the 
College for the purpose of free scholarships, and on this 
foundation the Trustees established five free scholarships 
named the “Schermerhorn Scholarships,” nomination to 
which is vested in the nearest male relative in each gen- 
eration of the late Mr. Schermerhorn. 
In the same year Mr. John Winthrop Chanler, an 
alumnus of the College of the class of ’47, bequeathed 
$1000 to the College, the income of which was to be given 
annually to that member of the senior class who should 
be the author of the best essay, in English prose, on the
-P-A-G-E-196
  144 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1880 history of civil government in America, or some other 
historical subject assigned by the Faculty. This bequest 
became available in 1879, and the first prize under it was 
awarded at the Commencement in 1880. 
In 1879 a new building, with a frontage of two hundred 
feet on Madison Avenue and a depth of about sixty feet, 
was completed at a cost of over $200,000, for the use of 
the College. The name “ Hamilton Hall” was officially 
given to this building. 
In 1880 the Trustees provided that two hours a week 
during the freshman and sophomore years should be 
thereafter devoted to French, German, Italian, Spanish, 
Danish, or Swedish, at the option of the student; that in 
the junior year all the regular exercises in History, the 
English Language and Literature, and Anglo-Saxon, and 
in the senior year the same, with the exception of History, 
should be obligatory upon all the students; and all the 
other studies, to which were added German, French, 
Spanish, Italian, Danish, Swedish, and Icelandic, should be 
elective ; and finally, that students should receive, on the 
satisfactory completion of their course, “the degree of 
Bachelor of Letters, Bachelor of Science, or Bachelor of 
Arts, according to the character of the studies chiefly 
pursued by them.” In 1885 this plan was modified by 
restricting the choice as to modern languages, in the 
freshman and sophomore years, to German and French, 
with the proviso that the one chosen should be pursued 
until the end of the junior year; by making obligatory, 
during the junior year, ten hours a week in Greek, Latin, 
English, History and Political Economy, Logie and Psy- 
chology, other studies being elective ; and by making all 
the studies of the senior year elective. In 1887 the choice 
as to modern languages, in freshman and sophomore years, 
was again enlarged so as to include German, French, 
Italian, and Spanish. 
In October, 1880, a School of Political Science was

opened. Professor John McVickar had delivered, in 1818 
and subsequently, courses of lectures on Political Econ- 
omy, the first, perhaps, that were ever delivered in an 
American College. Instruction in Political Science was 
part of the University plan of the Trustees, and Professor 
Francis Lieber, by the importance he gave it in connec- 
tion with his historical and legal lectures, laid the basis 
for its fuller development. 
In June, 1883, the Trustees provided that a course of 
collegiate study, equivalent to the course given to young 
men in the College, should be offered to such women as 
might desire to avail themselves of it, to be pursued 
under the general direction of the Faculty of the College ; 
admission to such course to be by a strict preliminary ex- 
amination ; each student admitted to be entirely free as to 
where and how she should pursue her studies, to be ex- 
amined in writing at stated times by officers of the Col- 
lege or their representatives, and to be entitled, at the end 
of her fourth year, or on the completion of any of the 
prescribed courses, to receive a certificate stating the 
subjects that she had pursued, and with what success. 
In February, 1887, the plan was modified by authorizing 
the conferring of the degree of Bachelor of Arts upon 
students who should satisfactorily complete a full course, 
equivalent to that for which the degree is bestowed upon 
young men. 
No new students were received in the collegiate course 
for women after 1889, because of the establishment of a 
separate College for women, named “ Barnard College,” 
in honor of President Barnard. 
On the completion of the Library Hall the several 
libraries of the College were consolidated into one collec- 
tion. In 1881 Stephen Whitney Phoenix, of the class of 
*59, bequeathed to the College his private library, a 
choice collection of about seven thousand volumes, in fine 
condition, embracing many very valuable and some very 
L 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
146 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1885 rare works. In 1885 J. F. Loubat, Esq., of New York, 
presented to the Library books and plates which cost 
over $20,000; and in 1886 A. A. Low, Esq., of Brook- 
lyn, New York, presented $5000 for the purchase of 
books. 
Early in 1884 Lewis M. Rutherfurd, Esq., of New 
York, presented to the College a valuable collection of 
astronomical apparatus; also a large number of plates of 
star photographs, representing original work of great in- 
terest and importance, the utilization of which by the 
Department of Astronomy has been of service to science, 
and has met with wide and cordial appreciation. 
In June, 1885, Professor John Tyndall, of London, pre- 
sented to the College $10,800, to be used as a fund for the 
encouragement of scientific research. With this fund the 
Trustees established the John Tyndall Fellowship for 
the encouragement of research in Physics. 
In the year preceding Dr. Barnard’s assumption of 
office the number of students was one hundred and sixty- 
six. The course was obligatory throughout, except that 
German was a voluntary study. The Library was small 
(14,941 volumes, exclusive of pamphlets), but choice, es- 
pecially in classical literature, was confined in its use to 
College officers, members of the upper classes, and such 
freshmen as might be designated by the President, 
and was open for delivery of books from 1 to 3 P.M. five 
days in the week during term time, holidays excepted. 
There were, in German, four prizes for excellence, — two 
in the junior class of $30 and $20, respectively, and two 
of like amounts in the sophomore class. There were, also, 
two “annual seminary prizes,” one in Greek of $80 and 
one in English of $20, to be competed for by members of 
the graduating class who were candidates for the Episcopal 
Ministry ; and the Alumni Association prize of $50 “to the 
most faithful and deserving student of the graduating 
class.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-201
PRESIDENT FREDERICK A. P. BARNARD 147 
At the close of Dr. Barnard’s presidency, among other 1889 
changes and improvements, there were in the School of 
Arts [the College proper] two hundred and thirty-five 
students and in the “ collegiate course for women” twenty- 
five, a total of two hundred and sixty. 
The College curriculum had been enlarged and liberal- 
ized. The course in the freshman and sophomore years 
was obligatory, except that members of these classes were 
required to choose German or French and continue the 
study of the language chosen till the end of the junior 
year. Members of the junior class were required to take 
ten of the fifteen hours a week allowed as a minimum, in 
prescribed studies noted above, the remaining hours being 
open to elective studies. All the studies of the senior 
year were elective, subject to the provision that at least 
fifteen hours a week must be taken. The electives offered 
covered a wide range, in the Greek and Latin Languages 
and Literatures, English Language and Literature, French, 
Italian, Spanish, German, and Icelandic; in Mathematics, 
Astronomy, Mechanics, Physics, Chemistry, Geology, and 
Paleontology ; in Philosophy, Ethics and Psychology, His- 
tory, Political Science and International Law, Political 
Economy and Social Science. There were large, varied, 
and important collections illustrating the several scientific 
courses given in the College, all well arranged and acces- 
sible to students. There was, also, an Astronomical 
Observatory, well equipped for purposes of instruction. 
The general and technical libraries that had been accu- 
mulated had been united and all housed in a fine build- 
ing constructed for the purpose on the College block. 
The Library contained 99,483 volumes and 20,000 pam- 
phlets ; more than 500 different serials, including the 
leading periodicals, transactions of societies, etc., were 
regularly received ; it was open to all officers, students, 
and graduates for borrowing and reference, daily, includ~ 
ing all holidays and vacations, except Sundays, Good Fri-

1889 day, Fourth of July, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas. 
There were the following prizes: Alumni Association 
prize of $50 and two “annual seminary prizes” as before 
noted ; and the Chanler historical prize. There were four- 
teen scholarships of the annual value of $100 each; four 
offered for competition to members of the freshman class, 
and five each to members of the sophomore and junior 
classes respectively ; also two fellowships conferred annu- 
ally by the Trustees on the written recommendation of the 
Faculty upon such graduates as proposed to enter upon 
a course of study for higher attainments, in letters or 
science, and who were adjudged by the Faculty to be 
capable of attaining, and likely to attain, distinction in 
such course of study. 
After twenty-five years of illustrious service as Presi- 
dent, Dr. Barnard died on Saturday, April 27, 1889. He 
made the College the residuary legatee of all that he pos- 
sessed: one portion of the fund devised, “to the amount 
of ten thousand dollars, to be set apart and to constitute 
the foundation of a fellowship to be entitled ‘The Barnard 
Fellowship for Encouraging Scientific Research’: the an- 
nual income from the sum so set apart to be devoted to the 
support or partial support of some Alumnus of the School 
of Arts, or of the School of Science known as the School 
of Mines of Columbia College, who may be recommended 
to the Trustees by the joint vote of the Faculties of the 
said schools, as evincing decided aptness for physical in- 
vestigation, and who may be disposed to devote himself 
to such investigation for some years continuously.” The 
remainder of the estate devised “to constitute a fund, 
under the name of ‘The Barnard Fund for the Increase 
of the Library’; the income from the same to be devoted 
to the purchase, on account of the Library of Columbia 
College, of such books as from time to time may be most 
needed, but especially relating to physical or astronomi- 
cal science ; selecting, in preference, those which may be 
   
-P-A-G-E-203
  PRESIDENT FREDERICK A. P. BARNARD 149 
likely to be most useful to persons engaged in scientific 1889 
investigation. But of the income from the said fund I 
desire that so much as may be necessary shall be applied 
in the manner following: The Trustees of Columbia 
College shall cause to be struck, with suitable devices, a 
medal of gold, nine-tenths fine, of the bullion value of 
not less than two hundred dollars, to be styled ‘The 
Barnard Medal for Meritorious Service to Science,’ and 
shall publicly announce that a copy of the same shall be 
awarded, at the close of every quinquennial period, dating 
from the probate of this, my last will and testament, to 
such person, whether a citizen of the United States or of 
any other country, as shall, within the five years next 
preceding, have made such discovery in physical or astro- 
nomical science, or such novel application of science to 
purposes beneficial to the human race, as, in the judg- 
ment of the National Academy of Sciences of the United 
States, shall be esteemed most worthy of such honor.” 
In a minute of a meeting of the Trustees of the College, 
held May 6, 1895, is recorded the following resolution : 
“Resolved that in accordance with the recommendation 
of the National Academy of Science, the first award of 
the Barnard Medal for Meritorious Service to Science be 
made at the coming Commencement to Lord Rayleigh, for 
his brilliant discovery of Argon.” Lord Rayleigh, Pro- 
fessor of Natural Philosophy in the Royal Institution of 
London, England, declined to receive the medal on the 
ground that he would thereby be doing an injustice to 
Professor Ramsay, who was associated with him in the 
discovery. The Trustees thereupon ordered two medals 
to be struck, and President Low personally delivered 
them, in London, to the distinguished gentlemen. 
This imperfect notice of President Barnard’s adminis- 
tration may fitly close with the following extract from 
the minutes of a memorial meeting of the Columbia Col- 
lege Alumni held at the College in June, 1889 : —

150 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
“Tn 1864, at the date of Dr. Barnard’s accession to the 
Presidency, the College was at a critical period of its his- 
tory. It was ready for development and had begun to 
develop. The Law School had been established a few 
years previously and was in successful operation. The 
School of Mines was in process of organization. The 
Trustees had for several years been considering the ex- 
pansion of the undergraduate course, and in connection 
therewith a system of University education. At this 
crucial period, the College happily obtained, as its chief 
counsellor and guide, Dr. Barnard, —a profound student 
of education, in sympathy with all forms of higher devel- 
opment, literary as well as scientific; of quick perception; 
peculiarly open to new ideas and prolific of them; of 
learning deep, exact and extensive in many fields; a 
classical and an English scholar, a fine mathematician, 
physicist, chemist, and adding to his severer accomplish- 
ments that of being a poet and a musician of no mean 
quality; a prolific, elegant and persuasive writer ; a logi- 
cal and convincing speaker; of sanguine, enthusiastic 
temperament, bold and persistent in the advocacy of his 
opinions and impervious to discouragement. He quick- 
ened into organic life the School of Mines ; he gave vital- 
izing force to the extension and liberalization of the 
undergraduate course, to the founding of fellowships for 
the encouragement and assistance in their higher studies 
of earnest and able young men, to the extension of the 
Library and the liberalization of its management, to the 
project of a course for the higher study of political and 
historical subjects, and to the scheme for a broad and 
liberal system of postgraduate or University instruc- 
tion, which the College had long but vainly desired. In 
brief, he gave Columbia College a new life and a new 
significance, and by his commanding position in many 
learned societies, by the force and elegance of his pub- 
lished writings, scientific, literary, legal, political, educa- 
tional, and by his wide acquaintance with the foremost 
men of his time, he attracted attention to the College and 
did much to interest the community at large in it. 
“¢ Age could not wither nor custom stale 
His infinite variety.’
-P-A-G-E-205
  
PRESIDENT FREDERICK A. P. BARNARD 151 
“He possessed, with such men as Gladstone and Bis- 1889 
marek (it is a very rare quality), the fervor in age that he 
had in youth, and was as ready as he was before he had 
secured position and fame, to take up a new idea, a 
new project, and pursue it with as much vigor as if 
a long life were still before him, and all his reputation 
yet to make. It was this quality that made him a great 
President to the very last. With almost his latest 
breath, unable to write, and speaking with difficulty, he 
dictated letters of counsel upon what was ever nearest his 
great heart — Columbia College and her future. 
“The departure of such a man is a loss beyond ade- 
quate expression. But he is not wholly lost. During 
his long period of service, longer and more distinguished 
than that of any of his predecessors, he so impressed him- 
self upon the College in many vital particulars, that 
though dead he shall yet speak for all time to come.” 
   
-P-A-G-E-206
CHAPTER XIII 
  1890-1901 
PRESIDENT SETH LOW 
On the 7th of October, 1889, Seth Low, of the class 
of ’70, was chosen President to succeed Dr. Barnard. 
His installation took place at the Metropolitan Opera 
House on Monday morning, February 38, 1890, at half- 
past ten o'clock. “The proceedings in the Metropolitan 
Opera House,” says a contemporary account, © “which 
offers a fitting and stately scene for so dignified and im- 
pressive a ceremonial, were worthy of the great occasion. 
The vast and sympathetic audience and the distinguished 
assembly of guests, which was probably as notable a gather- 
ing of men most eminent in institutions of learning as has 
been seen in the country, except perhaps at the two hun- 
dred and fiftieth anniversary of the foundation of Har- 
vard, listened with unflagging sympathy to a series of 
admirable addresses, in which not only the highest proprie- 
ties of the occasion were observed, but in the more impor- 
tant of which the tone was significant and unmistakable.” 
The Chairman of the Trustees, the Hon. Hamilton 
Fish, LL.D., of the class of ’27, having been, at his 
own request, excused, by reason of uncertain health, from 
making the address of installation, the Rev. Morgan 
Dix, 8.T.D., D.C.L., of the class of ’48, was appointed to 
make the address on behalf of the Trustees. 
The formal act of installation was performed by Mr. 
Fish. 
Mr. Low, in his reply to the Trustees, spoke of the great 
development of the College in the twenty years since his

  graduation, and, in that connection, of the conspicuous 1890 
services of his immediate predecessor. 
Then followed an address on behalf of all the Faculties 
by Professor Henry Drisler, LL.D., of the class of ’39, 
senior Professor and acting President; an address on be- 
half of all the alumni by Frederic R. Coudert, LL.D., 
of the class of °50, President of the College Alumni 
Association ; an address on behalf of all the students by a 
representative committee; and the President’s inaugural 
address. 
On the evening of the same day a dinner was given by 
the alumni in honor of the new President, of which was 
said at the time :— ; 
“On Monday evening, February 3, 1890, was held the 
largest and most successful dinner ever given by the 
alumni of Columbia College. It was in all respects worthy 
of the Inauguration ceremonies of the morning at the 
Metropolitan Opera House. 
“The large dining-hall of the Hotel Brunswick was 
everywhere resplendent with the colors of Columbia. 
Broad stripes of blue and white material covered the walls 
in graceful folds, and garlands of blue and white formed 
a frieze, beneath which hung banners and flags, trophies 
of Saratoga and Henley, the Harlem and the Thames, 
encircling the rooms. Banks of ferns and growing plants 
placed in front of the mirrors were surmounted by crossed 
flags and palm branches. Blue and white cloths covered 
the tables, and in front of each guest was a little volume, 
beautifully bound, containing the programme of the day, 
the list of speakers, and the menu. In addition to the 
large number in the main hall, nearly one hundred of the 
younger alumni occupied the large corner room as an 
annex.” 
In an account of the occasion given in Harper’s Weekly 
of February 15 Mr. George William Curtis wrote : — 
“President Eliot, of Harvard, in a frank and friendly 
speech, which fitly ended the proceedings of a memorable 
College day with the counsel and benediction of our oldest
-P-A-G-E-210
   154 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1890 College, mentioned some facts in regard to Harvard simi- 
   lar to those respecting Columbia mentioned by President 
Low. Upon this subject the moral of the Harvard Presi- 
dent’s speech was that Columbia required a more liberal 
support from New York than it had received, and that with 
such support it would become an institution in extent and 
variety, no less than in quality, worthy of the chief city 
of the country. His concluding remarks upon the true 
range and scope of such an institution were in a lofty 
strain, which was as delightful as it was natural because 
it was the true voice of Harvard. It was the close of a 
day of renewed hope and faith and energy, which had re- 
called Jay and Hamilton, Livingston and Morris, Clinton 
and Verplanck, to illustrate the early leadership of Co- 
lumbia, and to stimulate the just pride of a great city in 
its oldest school. The chief Colleges which were not too 
distant had come to congratulate their comrade. A host 
of proud alumni were gathered to cheer the happy event. 
‘It is a great day for Columbia,’ said Mr. Coudert, the 
President of the Alumni, as with quaint humor and felici- 
tous eloquence he presided at the dinner; ‘but it is a 
greater day for New York.’” 
President Low immediately addressed himself, with 
energy and skill, to the task before him. All about him 
were lying the component parts of a University, but they 
needed to be fitted together into a harmonious whole and 
endowed with a single spirit. He accomplished much by 
the close of the academic half year in which he was in- 
augurated. When he took charge “the attitude of the 
institution towards the student,” to quote from the Presi- 
dent’s first annual report, “ was one of multiplied oppor- 
tunities, but opportunities held more or less out of relation 
to each other”; the several parts or schools composing the 
institution were separately vigorous, but lacked codrdi- 
nation and mutual helpfulness, each being administered 
by its own Faculty with too little reference to the others ; 
the Faculties were severally devoted to the aggrandize- 
ment of their special charges rather than to the advance- 
ment of the institution in its entirety; advanced or 
 
-P-A-G-E-211
PRESIDENT SETH LOW ~ 155 
“graduate” courses were warmly encouraged and were 1890 
being actively developed in most or all the departments, 
though in a somewhat irregular and desultory way, being 
dependent upon heads of departments rather than upon 
Faculties or a central governing body. The first requisites 
seemed to be —to place the “ graduate ” courses in charge 
of properly organized Faculties and to devise a central 
body to unify the institution and govern it in all its ac- 
tivities as one whole, instead of as so many parts. In 
May, 1890, the “ first requisites” indicated were supplied. 
Further, it was ordained that a student was to matricu- 
late simply as a student of Columbia, paying but one ma- 
triculation fee, and, under the necessary regulations, to 
become entitled thereby to all the facilities offered by the 
institution in any of its parts. 
An immediate and important result of the reorganiza- 
tion so far effected was the permission given to members 
of the senior class in the College to take as elective 
courses counting toward their degree of A.B., courses 
under any Faculty (including the professional faculties) 
designated by such Faculty as open to them. This 
privilege, could be, and soon came to be, used to shorten 
the time required for the college and a professional course 
combined. 
“Thus at one stroke,” as the President remarked in 
his first annual report, ‘Columbia ceased to be divided 
into fragments, and took upon herself the aspect of a 
University, wherein each department was related to every 
other, and every one strengthened all.” 
In May, 1891, the College received the bequest of 
$100,000, left by Charles M. Da Costa, a Trustee of the 
College and an alumnus of the class of 55, who had died 
the preceding summer. His legacy was left to the dis- 
cretion of the Trustees for the establishment of a Profes- 
sorship. It was used for the establishment of a depart- 
ment of Biology, at the head of which was placed Henry

1891 Fairfield Osborn, Sc.D., of Princeton University. By the 
   appointment also of Professor Osborn as Curator of Mam- 
malian Paleontology in the American Museum of Natural 
History in New York, the first step was taken toward the 
series of affiliations with important institutions in the city 
which Columbia was to make. 
In the course of the year 1891 arrangements were made 
by which continued and effective service on the part of 
officers was to be especially recognized. An ordinance was 
adopted, granting to each Professor the privilege of taking, 
on half-pay, a year’s leave of absence once in every seven 
years; and providing that any Professor after a service 
of fifteen years or upward in the College, and who is also 
sixty-five years of age or over, may, if he choose, retire on 
half-pay. 
A notable academic event occurred in the latter part of 
the collegiate year 1893-1894. At that time was celebrated 
the semi-centennial in the service of the College of Henry 
Drisler, LL.D., of the class of 89. Professor Drisler 
had held the chairs of both Latin and Greek, had twice 
been acting President, once in 1867 during President 
Barnard’s absence as United States Commissioner to the 
Paris Exposition, and again in 1888 and 1889 during Presi- 
dent Barnard’s last illness and before the inauguration of 
President Low, was Dean of the “School of Arts,” an 
office created for him at the close of his last term as acting 
President, and had acquired, as a classicist, a wide and 
enviable reputation. The College Alumni Association 
held a public reception in his honor to testify their respect 
and veneration. A volume of “classical studies,” each 
article in which was written by a former pupil as a tribute 
of affection, was given to him at Commencement by one 
of the contributors, his colleague, the late Professor 
Merriam. At the Commencement, also, the Rev. Dr. 
Dix presented him, on behalf of the Trustees, with a 
beautiful gold medal, struck in commemoration of the
-P-A-G-E-213
  
PRESIDENT SETH LOW 157 
event, together with an appropriate minute printed on 1894 
vellum. The Trustees established in the College a 
fellowship in Classical Philology, of the value of $500 a 
year, to be known as the “ Henry Drisler Fellowship of 
Classical Philology”; and President Low added to his 
numerous other and splendid gifts to the College the 
sum of $10,000 to endow a “Henry Drisler Classical 
Fund” for the benefit of the departments of Greek and 
Latin, the income to be “placed at the disposal of these 
Departments for the purchase of books, maps, charts, 
busts or equipment of any kind whatever that will tend 
to make instruction in the classics at this University more 
interesting and more attractive.” 1 
From the time of Mr. Low’s accession to the Presidency, 
the interest of the community in the College was greatly 
stimulated and manifested itself in substantial benefactions. 
In addition to numerous contributions of books, and of 
money for books and collections and for the founding of prizes, aggregating a large sum, there were given in 
generous amounts for account of the purchase of the 
new site that had been selected on the upper west side 
of the Island at 116th Street. For this purpose, Messrs. 
J. Pierpont Morgan and Cornelius Vanderbilt gave, each, 
$100,000; Mr. D. Willis James, $50,000; Mr. A. A. 
Low, $15,000; Messrs. R. Fulton Cutting and Alfred C. 
Clark, each $10,000; and the following $5000 each: 
Messrs. Samuel D. Babcock, Abram S. Hewitt, Morris K. 
Jessup, Seth Low, Oswald Ottendorfer, Henry Parish, 
Jacob H. Schiff, and Samuel Sloan. Numerous smaller 
amounts were given, and through the College Alumni 
Association $50,000 were subscribed. 
The legacy of $100,000 left by Mr. Da Costa has already 
been noted. 
In the will of the late Daniel B. Fayerweather, Colum- 
bia was named as one of the institutions to receive, out of 
1 Professor Drisler died November 80, 1897.

158 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1893 his most generously devised estate, $200,000. The amount 
was increased by over $100,000, through the action of 
the executors in awarding to Columbia a portion of the 
residue of the estate left after payment of the several 
bequests specified in the will. In commemoration of this 
bequest, the building to be ultimately devoted to the de- 
partment of physics was named “ Fayerweather Hall.” 
On her death, in 1892, the widow of President Barnard 
added to the bequest of her husband for the benefit of the 
College her own estate, amounting to about $20,000. 
In 1893 Charles Bathgate Beck, of the class of ’77, 
bequeathed to the College $2000 for the endowment of 
prizes, $8000 for scholarships, and one-fourth of his resid- 
uary estate, consisting of an extensive tract of land in 
the Borough of the Bronx which is likely to be of great 
value. 
Mr. Joseph Pulitzer, of New York, gave the College 
$100,000, in return for which the College agreed to pay 
the tuition of a number of boys, not exceeding ten a year, 
during the three years which they must pass at a high 
school in preparation for College and to grant, to such of 
them as might enter Columbia, free tuition. The condi- 
tions have since been modified in view of the establish- 
ment of the public high schools of the city. 
The Hon. Hamilton Fish, of the class of ’27, whose 
service to the College as Trustee and Chairman of the 
Board was long and conspicuous, who served his native 
State well in legislative halls and as Governor, and the 
country at large as Senator of the United States from 
New York and as Secretary of State under President 
Grant, died in September, 1893, and left to his alma mater 
a bequest of $50,000. 
President Low, with characteristic munificence, made 
himself responsible for a Library building at the new 
site on Morningside Heights, to cost $1,000,000; Mr. 
William C. Schermerhorn (in addition to other costly
-P-A-G-E-215
PRESIDENT SETH LOW 159 
gifts) provided funds for a building to cost $450,000 ; 1895 
and the children and nephew of the late Frederick Chris- 
tian Havemeyer gave, in his memory, $450,000 to erect 
a building for chemical lecture rooms and laboratories. 
Mrs. Elizabeth Mary Ludlow offered real estate and per- 
sonal property for the endowment of a fund for instruc- 
tion in Music, as a memorial of her son, Robert Center ; 
the Trustees accepted, with “their grateful thanks for 
her munificent gift,” and, with her permission, designated 
the Fund as the “ Robert Center Fund for Instruction in 
Music, founded by his Mother.” 
In recognition of President Low’s great personal gen- 
erosity, the Trustees established in the College twelve 
scholarships, to be known as Brooklyn Scholarships, to 
be awarded by competition to boys resident in Brooklyn 
and prepared for College in any school in Brooklyn, pub- 
lic or private, each scholarship to be of the annual value 
of $150, to be held for the full College course of four 
years, the holder to pay tuition and all other fees; schol- 
arships in Barnard College; University scholarships; a 
University Fellowship; and a “Seth Low Professorship 
of History.” The President was requested to nominate 
the first incumbent of the Professorship, and, on his nomi- 
nation, William M. Sloane, Ph.D., L.H.D., of the class 
of ’68, for many years Professor in Princeton University, 
first of Latin and then of History, a historian of repute, 
author of the Life of Napoleon, became the first Seth Low 
Professor of History. 
It had been evident, for some time, that the institution 
had become substantially a University in all but name, 
and that its corporate title, “Columbia College,” could 
no longer be used with convenience, propriety, or advan- 
tage to cover its manifold activities. The original Col- 
lege had come to be designated, for distinction, the 
“School of Arts,” an unfortunate and somewhat mis- 
leading title that had become current to distinguish, in 
 
-P-A-G-E-216
160 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
  i896 printed documents, the “ College proper” from its several 
“associated schools.” The Dean of the College, in his re- 
port to the President for the year 1894-1895, called atten- 
tion to the desirableness, on many accounts, of allowing 
the “School of Arts” to resume its rightful name of 
Columbia College; and the President, in his report to 
the Trustees for the same year, said that he cared noth- 
ing about the title of the corporation; “but I do care 
very much about our statutory and educational nomencla- 
ture; and I shall shortly submit proposed amendments to 
the statutes intended to give effect to the use of the name 
University for the institution as a whole, and of Columbia 
College for the School of Arts.” 
Accordingly he presented his amendments, which were 
adopted. The title of the corporation remains unchanged, 
but in February, 1896, it was, “ Resolved That, in all offi- 
cial publications hereafter issued by or under authority 
of the Trustees, all the departments of instruction and 
research maintained and managed by this corporation 
may, for convenience, be designated collectively as ‘Co- 
lumbia University in the City of New York,’ or ‘ the Uni- 
versity’; and the School of Arts, as the name is now 
known and described, may hereafter be designated as 
‘Columbia College,’ or ‘the College.’” 
In 1892 the purchase of a new site and removal thither 
was determined upon. The situation at 49th Street and 
Madison Avenue had always been regarded as temporary. 
It had been intended to make use of a portion of the 
“Botanic Garden” property, between 49th and 50th 
streets fronting Fifth Avenue, for permanent buildings, 
but that design had been abandoned. Subsequently, in 
1872, property was purchased near 161st Street and Ridge 
Road, containing about eight acres, and known as the 
“ Wheelock property.” After the land had been acquired, 
reluctance to place there buildings for the College and its 
several parts—the Law School and the School of Mines, and

further accommodations for development of the Univer- 1892 sity system that was in contemplation and preparation — grew up and became sufficiently strong to cause delay and then relinquishment of the project. But the necessity of removal from the cramped quarters at 49th Street, and the noisy neighborhood of a great railroad, and that at no distant day, was constantly urged upon the Trustees by President Barnard. And the Trustees frequently took action, looking to the carrying out of Dr. Barnard’s recom- mendation. . But no plot suitable in size and position was suggested till Mr. John B. Pine, of the class of ’77 and one of the Trustees, called attention to the four blocks of land owned by the New York Hospital and occupied by the Bloomingdale Asylum, lying between 116th and 120th streets, Amsterdam Avenue, and the Boulevard. In December, 1891, an option was taken on the land with the buildings thereon, for $2,000,000 ; in April, 1892, the option was closed and the question of the future home of Columbia was settled. 
The site thus acquired was not only of large proportions, consisting of four undivided city blocks about eighteen acres in extent, nobly situated on the crown of the Island of Manhattan, overlooking a grand sweep of the Hudson River, but had also much historic interest. It was in this immediate vicinity, and partly upon this very ground, that the Revolutionary battle of Harlem Heights was fought, and, for the first time in that contest, the raw undisciplined American volunteers showed that their valor and persist- ence could successfully withstand the royal troops, and the ground was fitly consecrated to high purposes by the blood of early martyrs to the cause of rational freedom. Again, in the War of 1812, it was a scene of defensive activity in which the College, as such, had a part. It appears that the students and alumni of the College participated, as a body, in the preparations for the defence of the city against the British by throwing up fortifications at Har-

1895 lem Heights, as witness the following advertisement that 
appeared in the Evening Post of October 25, 1814: — 
« Notice. Vincit amor patrie laudumque immensa cupido 
Sicne VATQ. 
«The students and former graduates of Columbia College, 
together with such other young gentlemen as are desirous of 
performing another day’s labour on Harlaem Heights, are re- 
quested to assemble in the College Green on Wednesday, the 
26th inst., at half past 6 o’clock, for the purpose of proceeding 
to the same. 
“ By order of the Committee.” 
The College was not to take possession of the property 
till January 1, 1895 (the date was afterward changed to 
October 1, 1894), and rare opportunity was thus afforded, 
and made use of, for careful consideration and adoption of 
the best plans for its development for university pur- 
poses. 
The first corner-stone to be set in its place of any of 
the new buildings was that of the Library, given by Mr. 
Low as a memorial of his father, the late Abiel Abbot 
Low; and this occurred December 7, 1895. In compli- 
ance with the President’s request, the ceremonies were 
very simple and were held in presence of the Trustees and 
a few Professors and friends. The Rev. Dr. Van De 
Water, Chaplain of the University, officiated at the ser- 
vice, President Low laid the corner-stone, and the Rt. 
Rev. Bishop Potter made a brief address. 
The formal dedication of the new site and the laying 
of the corner-stones of Schermerhorn Hall, the gift of 
William C. Schermerhorn, of the class of °40, Chairman 
of the Trustees, and designed for the accommodation of 
the natural sciences, and of the Physics Building, took 
place on Saturday, May 2, 1896. At 12 o’clock on that 
day, in the presence of a large number of alumni and 
other friends of Columbia, the ceremonies began with 
the Physics Building ; the Rev. Dr. Marvin R. Vincent,

PRESIDENT SETH LOW 163 
of the class of ’54, officiated as Chaplain, Professor Ogden 1896 
N. Rood, Professor of Physics, laid the corner-stone, and 
an address was made by Professor J. H. Van Amringe, 
of the class of 60, Dean of the College. Immediately 
thereafter, at Schermerhorn Hall, the Rev. Dr. Dix, of 
the class of ’48, Rector of Trinity Parish, officiated as 
Chaplain, the corner-stone was laid by Mr. Schermerhorn, 
and Dr. Henry F. Osborn, Da Costa Professor of Zodlogy, 
made an address. In the afternoon the site itself was 
formally dedicated in the presence of five thousand people, 
including the highest officers of the state and the city, 
women representing all that is best in refined and culti- 
vated society, and “men renowned in law, literature, art, 
science, and commerce.” The exercises were opened with 
prayer by the Rev. Dr. Edward B. Coe. The first address 
was made by President Low. “We are met to-day,” 
said he, “to dedicate to a new use this historic ground. 
Already it is twice consecrated. In the Revolutionary 
War this soil drank the blood of patriots, willingly shed 
for the independence of the land. Since then, for three 
generations, it has witnessed the union of science and of 
brotherly kindness devoted to the care of humanity suffer- 
ing from the most mysterious of all the ills that flesh is 
heir to. To-day we dedicate it, in the same spirit of 
loyalty to the country and of devotion to mankind, to 
the inspiring use of a venerable and historic University.” 
The presentation of the national colors on behalf of 
Lafayette Post, Grand Army of the Republic, was made 
by Rear-Admiral Richard W. Meade, United States Navy, 
Post Commander. On behalf of his comrades, he pre- 
sented “to the President and Trustees of Columbia Uni- 
versity, the flag of our country, to be hoisted at the staff 
erected by Lafayette Post in front of the Library building, 
where, resting upon a granite and bronze support, typical 
of the enduring nature of the principles symbolized by 
the banner of the nation, there will be found on the 
 
-P-A-G-E-224
    164 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1896 pedestal, in letters of bronze, the charge to the students 
   of Columbia to ‘love, cherish and defend it.’” 
President Low, in accepting the flag, said : “In the name 
of the men of King’s College who fought for the indepen- 
dence of the Colonies, and did so much to establish the 
Government of these United States; in the name of the 
men of Columbia College who in the War of 1812 and in 
the Mexican War fought under this flag in the country’s 
quarrel ; and in the name of the men of Columbia Univer- 
sity, who fought, as you fought, in the War for the pres- 
ervation of the Union, and who helped to bring unscathed 
out of the storm of the War this glorious flag, I pledge 
you for this University that we shall ‘love, cherish, and 
defend it.’” 
The Dedication Ode in Latin, written by Dr. Harry 
Thurston Peck, of the class of ’81, Professor of Latin, 
was sung to the air “ Integer vite.” 
Then followed the principal address of the day by the 
Hon. Abram S. Hewitt, LL.D., of the class of ’42, a 
former Mayor of the City of New York. In beginning 
his noble oration, distinguished for learning, wisdom, and 
eloquence, Mr. Hewitt said : — 
“ This occasion and these impressive ceremonies are in- 
tended to recognize the trinity of religion, learning, and 
patriotism. It is most fitting that such a conjunction 
should be celebrated on these Morningside Heights, con- 
secrated by the blood of heroes in a conflict which first 
showed the ability of the Continental militia to hold their 
own against trained British soldiers whose valor had been 
proved on many a hard-fought field. It is meet and right 
that the ministers of the churches which were associated 
in the foundation of King’s College, and that the Bishop 
and other clergy of the noble Cathedral which hard by is 
slowly rearing its majestic proportions to Heaven, should 
lend to this occasion the benediction of their presence and 
their prayers. It accords with the fitness of things that 
the Presidents and Faculties of the great sister Institutions 
of Learning, which are the pride of the closing, and the
-P-A-G-E-225
  
PRESIDENT SETH LOW 165 
hope of the coming, century, are here to rejoice with 1896, 
Columbia in the day of her rejoicing, and to renew with 
her the pledge to train up a free people in the virtue and 
knowledge on which their liberties depend. It is well for 
the Governor and the Regents of the University of the 
great State of New York, by whose wise and timely legis- 
lation Columbia College was re-organized and endowed 
with an estate, which enables it at this late day to realize 
the expectations of the far-seeing legislators who declared 
that she was to become ‘the mother of a University,’ to 
witness the fulfilment of the prophecy of the fathers, on a 
scale of grandeur beyond the dreams of the most sanguine 
friends of sound learning. But above all, the presence of 
the Mayor of New York and of the members of the Cor- 
poration, its aldermen and commonalty, in this great 
audience assembled, is proof of the deep and abiding in- 
terest which the city has in the final dwelling-place of an 
institution which, as I shall hope to show, has contributed 
largely to its growth, is the most striking monument of its 
progress, and must be its guide in the development which 
promises to make it chief among the cities of the world. 
“Such a rare concurrence of piety, learning, wisdom 
and authority indicates that this occasion has a significance 
which demands and justifies an explanation, familiar as it 
must necessarily be to the students of history and to the 
friends of education, but necessary in order to comprehend 
the genesis and the mission of the new University, destined 
to radiate its influence for good in all time to come from 
these buildings which we are here to dedicate to the ser- 
vice of God and man. Let it be remembered, however, 
that we are here not to dedicate buildings alone, but also 
to dedicate to the responsibilities and duties of advancing 
civilization the wealth, the energies, and the potentialities 
of the millions of men who will in the ages to come consti- 
tute the population gathered around this centre of light 
and learning.” 
President Eliot, of Harvard University, then presented 
“the hearty congratulations of the sister Universities ” to 
Columbia “on the acquisition of this spacious site, of these 
rising buildings, and of numerous important additions to 
the material and intellectual resources of the University,”
-P-A-G-E-226
  166 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1897 and to “ the City, too, that its chief University is to have 
here a setting commensurate with the work of its intel- 
lectual and spiritual influence.” 
The dedication exercises were closed by the benediction 
pronounced by the Right Rev. Dr. Henry C. Potter, 
Bishop of New York. 
In the following November were laid the corner-stones 
of Havemeyer Hall and the Engineering building. In 
October, 1897, the six new buildings, viz., the Library, 
Schermerhorn, University, Fayerweather, and Havemeyer 
Halls, and the Engineering building, were completed, and 
two buildings erected by the previous owners were re- 
modelled and designated “ College Hall ”and “ West Hall.” 
The former was assigned to the use of the College until a 
building for its permanent occupation should be erected. 
The work of the College and of all the schools of the 
University, excepting the Medical School which had been 
previously established in 59th Street, was transferred to 
Morningside Heights, and was there begun on the morn- 
ing of Monday, October 4, with a chapel service in the 
great reading room of the Library, at which the President 
of the University made a brief address, and a hymn, 
written for the occasion by Mr. Charles A. Nelson, was 
sung. 
The building known as “College Hall,” though un- 
worthy of the name and increasingly inadequate for the 
use to which it is still applied, has served a useful purpose 
in aiding to preserve the identity of the College, and has 
witnessed the development of its curriculum and the 
growth of its student body far in advance of any previ- 
ously reached. In the last year at 49th Street (1896- 
1897) the number of students in the College was three 
hundred and fifteen, larger than that in any previous year. 
The number in the first year at Morningside Heights was 
three hundred and thirty-five, and this has increased to 
five hundred and four in the present year (1903-1904).
-P-A-G-E-227
PRESIDENT SETH LOW 167 
Generous provision is made for the assistance of needy 1897 
students of character in seventy-two scholarships of the 
annual value of $150 each. These scholarships are in- 
tended to be academic honors, and the holders are divided 
into three groups. The first group contains only those 
whose work entitles them to high academic distinction. 
The second consists of students of marked excellence who 
have not attained a position in the first group. The 
third comprises meritorious students to whom scholar- 
ships have been awarded on the grounds of special claim. 
Twenty of these scholarships are competitive : Alumni 
Competitive (4), one awarded annually; Hewitt and 
Harper (2 each), endowed by the gift of Abram S. 
Hewitt, class of ’42, and by the bequest of Joseph W. 
Harper, class of ’48, open annually for competition to 
graduates of New York City high schools; Brooklyn (12), 
founded in recognition of Mr. Low’s gift of a memorial 
building, three of them open for competition annually 
to vesidents of Brooklyn who have received their train- 
ing in either the public or the private schools of that 
borough. Eleven scholarships are open for award, with- 
out competition, to students of any class, whose record for 
ability and scholarship are satisfactory, viz.: Faculty (6); 
Beck (1), established in recognition of the liberality of 
Charles Bathgate Beck, class of ’77 ; Campbell (2), estab- 
lished by Miss Maria L. Campbell and Miss Catherine B. 
Campbell in memory of R. B. Campbell, class of ’44, and 
H. P. Campbell, class of 47; Class of 48 (2), established 
by a member of that class. Twenty-one of the scholar- 
ships are endowed, viz.: Schermerhorn (5), endowed by 
John Jones Schermerhorn, class of ’25; Moffat (2), en- 
dowed by William B. Moffat, class of °88; Stuart (2), 
endowed in memory of Sidney B. Stuart, class of ’80, and 
Eugene T. Stuart, class of °81, by their grandmother 
Cornelia A. Atwill; Alumni Association (4), established 
by the Trustees in recognition of the interest the Alumni

168 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1897 Association has always shown in the affairs of the College 
(the foregoing thirteen are open to Freshmen only) ; and Society for Promoting Religion and Learning, two in each 
class, founded by that Society and awarded upon its nomi- 
nation. Twenty of the scholarships are called Benefac- 
tors’ Scholarships and were established by the Trustees in recognition of the liberal gifts for the purchase of the site 
on Morningside Heights by those after whom they are 
named, viz. : Morgan (5), Vanderbilt (5), A. A. Low (8), 
Cutting (2), Clark (2), Sloan (1), Parish (A), Schiff (1); 
these are open to students who have been not less than 
one year in the College. 
In addition to the aid given to students by scholarships, 
there is a standing committee whose duty is to put students 
desiring to work their way through college, especially those 
coming from elsewhere than New York or the immediate 
vicinity, in the way of earning enough for their partial or 
complete support, or if possible to extend assistance to 
them in other ways while they are pursuing their studies 
in the College. A students’ loan fund of $5000 was, in 
1896, established by a gift from Jacob H. Schiff of New 
York. 
In his annual report to the President for the year ending 
June 380, 1897, — the last year at 49th Street, — the Dean 
of the College gave a summary of its educational history, 
which may be given in substance here : — 
The connection of Columbia College with the present site will cease with the close of the present academic year. The twoscore years that will have elapsed between the abandonment of College Place and the occupancy of the site on Morningside Heights have been years of anxiety, endeavor, change, and substantial advancement. The year of the removal to 49th Street was signalized by the adoption, after long atid careful deliberation on the part of the Trustees, of a statute remarkable for educational foresight and wisdom. It provided, in brief: a university course of study to be conducted in three schools, viz.: 
 
-P-A-G-E-229
PRESIDENT SETH LOW 169 
a School of Letters, a School of Science, and a School of 1897 
Jurisprudence ; an extended and liberal undergraduate 
course, involving three elective courses in the senior year, 
respectively adapted to fit students to enter upon the sev- 
eral university courses; prize scholarships ; fellowships, 
with or without stipends. 
The immediate results were an enlarged curriculum and 
the addition of several Professors to the Faculty of the Col- 
lege. In the fall of 1857 the elective courses in the senior 
year were inaugurated. A year later the university course 
of study was put into partial operation. The Statute 
of 1857, though delayed in its detailed execution by the 
anxious and disturbed period of the Civil War and by the 
restricted condition of the finances of the College, has 
found expression in the Schools of Law, Medicine, Applied 
Science, Political Science, Philosophy, and Pure Science. 
The choice allowed to seniors in 1857 was withdrawn after 
three years. After that time the policy with regard to 
elective studies fluctuated until fixed, for the time being 
at least, by the adoption of the “new curriculum.” Prizes 
for encouraging the study of Greek and of English have 
been established, as have likewise scholarships for compe- 
tition among members of the three lower classes, and fel- 
lowships in literature and science for members of the 
senior class. 
“The course of study in the College has engaged con- 
stant attention; has, as ideas have developed and ex- 
panded, been modified from time to time, and has finally 
resulted in an academic curriculum, to be put into effect 
on the removal to Morningside Heights, which is so con- 
structed, it is believed, as to secure to every one who 
follows it successfully all the elements of a liberal educa- 
tion as agreed upon by the best educational authorities in 
this country, at the same time that he may fit himself, 
better than ever before, to pursue with advantage advanced 
university courses, or prepare himself for the professional 
or other occupation to which he may choose to devote his 
life. This brief recapitulation of salient points in the 
history of progress may serve to show that the brooding 
period passed here has not been idly or unprofitably spent, 
that the College has, indeed, done meanwhile its full share 
in the discussion and attempted solution of the profound 
pedagogic problems of the time, in the amendment,

1900 improvement, and extension of all the educational means 
employed in making sound scholars, thoughtful men, and 
good citizens.” 
The curriculum put into effect in 1897-1898, with its 
subsequent modifications, may be found in Appendix C. 
In 1900, a restatement of the requirements for admis- 
sion was made to meet a difficulty that had been for some 
time apparent and that, after the opening of the public 
high schools in New York City, had become serious. The 
difficulty lay in the fact that a considerable number of 
students, particularly in the high schools, do not, till late 
in their course, form a desire to enter college, and then 
find that they are unable to do so because of lack of prep- 
aration in some required subject, generally Latin. ‘The 
restatement referred to, while not diminishing the amount 
of preliminary preparation requisite, is so made as not to 
necessitate the offering of Latin for entrance. Greek was 
eliminated as an entrance requirement three years ago. 
Of course either or both of the classical languages may 
still be offered, but there is a distinct difference in the 
attitude of the College to the two languages. When 
Greek was eliminated from the studies prescribed for 
admission, it was eliminated also from those prescribed for 
graduation. This is not the case with Latin, which, if not 
offered for entrance, must be taken for three consecutive 
years after entrance. So that, without changing the re- 
quirements for the degree of Bachelor of Arts, the advan- 
tages of the College are made available to many who 
would otherwise be excluded.” (Report of the Dean of 
the College, 1900.) 
In September, 1901, President Low was nominated for 
the Mayoralty of New York City by an organization of 
citizens styled “The Citizens’ Union.” He accepted the 
nomination and resigned the presidency of the College at 
the stated meeting of the Trustees in October, 1901. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-231
PRESIDENT SETH LOW 171 
Trustees accepted his resignation and appointed Professor 1901 
Nicholas Murray Butler Acting President. 
In accepting his resignation, the Trustees adopted a 
minute expressive of “their affectionate regard for Mr. 
Low personally and of their high opinion of the value of 
his services to the University,” and saying further : “ Mr. 
Low has now served as Trustee for twenty years. He 
has served as President for exactly twelve years, having 
been elected October 7, 1889,—a period marked by 
changes of the utmost importance, which may fairly be 
said to have created a new Columbia. A great University 
has been organized out of a group of scattered and unre- 
lated schools. It has been moved to new and generous 
quarters that worthily accommodate it and that invite the 
large expansion which is certainly before it. It has estab- 
lished intimate and satisfactory affiliations with Barnard 
College and Teachers College. Its educational organiza- 
tion is thorough and effective; a strong enthusiastic 
common life now pervades and inspires every part ; the 
number of its teachers and students was never so large ; 
its educational prestige was probably never higher ; and 
in every quarter, both inside and outside the University, 
the utmost good will prevails. Such a record of achieve- 
ment tells its own story of the head of the University ; 
but it would be a most incomplete account that failed to 
make some reference to Mr. Low’s extraordinary and 
unwearied generosity. At his own cost he has built the 
University Library building; he has established trust 
funds for the encouragement of study and research, and 
he has contributed in unnumbered ways to supplement 
the funds of the University, and to help every good cause 
in which its members were interested.”

     CHAPTER XIV 
COLLEGE LIFE 
On removal to Morningside Heights a great impetus 
was given to outdoor sports and a specific college life. 
Football has risen into prominence and is practised with 
enthusiasm and success. Many victories have been won 
and the University “Trophy Room” contains numerous 
prizes gained on the “gridiron.” A like remark may be 
made as to other forms of sport, as gymnasium contests, 
baseball, basketball, fencing, rowing, track and field 
athletics. 
Athletic sports have had, for reasons that are apparent, 
but slow recognition at Columbia. Sporadic attempts 
were made in that direction with fitful and brief success. 
Football of a mild type seems to have existed as a campus 
diversion as early as 1824, when seniors and sophomores 
lined up against juniors and freshmen. President King, 
who was fond of outdoor exercises and sports, attempted 
to interest the students in them, and met with but little 
encouragement. He induced the Trustees to appoint a 
teacher of boxing and fencing for the benefit of the stu- 
dents. The class of 59 had a boat crew in which they 
took great pride. Baseball was indulged in occasionally, 
and in 1867 a baseball association was formed. Class 
teams were organized, and a representative college team 
played with New York University, with City College, 
Yale, and Princeton. In 1869 an Athletic Association 
was formed to introduce and foster at Columbia rowing

Aspenwall Bradley of the class of ’99. 
172     
-P-A-G-E-233
    COLLEGE LIFE 173 
and track and field sports. College contests in track ath- 1876 
letics have been held since 1869, and in 1881 class games 
were instituted. Columbia joined the Intercollegiate 
Athletic Association in 1876, and in 1877 won the cham- 
pionship at Mott Haven. Since then the College has won 
the championship several times and held the cup for a 
number of years in succession. The Gymnasium, with all 
the conveniences and modern appliances that go to make a 
model of its kind, has increased the general interest in 
athletics and developed the capacity for their successful 
practice. The Athletic Field of about twenty acres at 
Williamsbridge, in the purchase and preparation of which 
the College Alumni Association largely aided, contributes 
to the same ends. 
For thirty years past, rowing has had much attention 
and excited a great deal of enthusiasm. In 1873 a crew 
was entered in the first intercollegiate regatta, held on the 
Thames River at Springfield, Massachusetts, and came in 
among the first four crews. The second intercollegiate 
regatta on Saratoga Lake in 1874 ended in a great triumph 
for Columbia. Saratoga was crowded with summer vis- 
itors, among whom was a large and representative body 
from the city of New York. These latter adopted, with 
great unanimity, the Columbia College crew as their own; 
and when that crew won the race in brilliant style, the 
village went wild with enthusiasm and delight. On the 
return of the crew to New York, they were received like a 
conquering army, with music, procession, and the booming 
of cannon. In 1876 a beautiful College boat-house was 
erected on the Harlem River at Mott Haven, costing over 
ten thousand dollars, of which the Trustees voted about 
two-thirds, and the remainder was raised by subscription 
among the alumni and friends of the College. In 1878 a 
four-oared crew was sent to England to contend in the 
races at Henley. This crew, consisting of Edward E. 
Sage, Cyrus Edson, Harry G. Ridabock, and Jasper T. 
  
-P-A-G-E-234
   174 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1878 Goodwin, defeated the pick of the English college crews 
   and the four from Dublin University, and won the Stew- 
ards’ Cup —the first and, so far, the only time that an 
American college crew has succeeded in bringing home a 
foreign trophy for superiority in rowing. So great was 
the satisfaction in New York at this victory that, on the 
return of the crew, they were met at the steamship land- 
ing by a large concourse of alumni and other citizens, in- 
cluding members of the Common Council of the city, 
and escorted up Broadway to Delmonico’s in 14th Street, 
where a great rejoicing was held. Subsequently the 
Common Council adopted resolutions of congratulation 
to the crew and the College which were signed by “ Smith 
Ely, Mayor,” were beautifully engrossed and framed by 
the city, and now hang in the large and well-filled 
“Trophy Room” of the University. Interest in boating 
has continued to be active. In 1896 Mr. Edwin Gould, 
a member of the class of ’88, gave to the College a fine 
boat-house on the Hudson River at the foot of 115th 
Street, to replace the one at Mott Haven which was dis- 
posed of on the removal of the College from 49th Street, 
and has since given $10,000 as a fund in aid of rowing. As 
this account is being written, word comes that the Columbia 
oarsmen have won five out of the six races in which they 
were entered in the 1904 Decoration Day Regatta on the 
Harlem River, carrying off five beautiful flags and more 
than sixty per cent of other prizes offered for competition. 
As has been before noted, literary societies and debating 
clubs constituted, at first and for a long time, the principal 
activity of students aside from the life of the class room. 
The establishment of the Philolexian and Peithologian 
Societies, in 1802 and 1806 respectively, has been referred 
to. These societies grew out of class debating clubs, were 
all inclusive of existing student interests, and between 
them embraced by far the greater part of the student 
body. They held annual exhibitions which were public

1897 and conducted by themselves; they invited prominent 
alumni to address them and printed the addresses at the 
expense of the Club treasuries ; they gathered a consider- 
able and very good library which, later, was given to 
the library of the College; they flourished till the 
rise of fraternities and athletic associations, and then 
they suffered a decline. By 1877 they had become so 
feeble that anew society was formed, the Barnard Literary 
Association, to revive interest in debates and public speak- 
ing. The old societies then took a new lease of life and, 
with the “ Barnard,” concerned themselves not so much 
with literary practice as with the cultivation of debating. 
The Peithologian Society became extinct in1894. The 
Philolexian Society and the Barnard Literary Association 
are still vigorous. Together they form the Debating 
Union and are open to members from the entire Univer- 
sity. The Union entered the field of intercollegiate debat- 
ing by defeating the Harvard Forum in 1897. Annual 
debates are held with the various universities and colleges, 
in which the Union has an honorable record. Fall and 
spring intersociety debates are also held, and occasionally 
each society holds, independently, outside debates with 
local clubs. A Freshman Debating Society was founded 
in 1901. 
College journalism had its vague beginnings in the 
literary societies. The first student publication on record 
was the Philolexian Observer, a little manuscript paper 
starting in 1818 and surviving only a few months. The 
Observer was strictly a private appurtenance of the Philo- 
lexian Society, was written by one of the members, and 
read by him at its weekly meetings. The Academic 
Recreations, the first printed publication at Columbia, was 
published by the members of the Peithologian Society, and 
had a place in the general college world as well. It was 
started in February, 1814, and ran only to the end of the 
college year. It was strictly literary in character; the
-P-A-G-E-239
COLLEGE LIFE 177 
names of its editors and even of its contributors are 1848 
unknown. There appears to have been no publication 
by the students after this, until 1848, when the series 
of Annual Catalogues was begun. ‘The first catalogue 
was published by Stephen R. Weeks, who, as janitor, 
assistant librarian and proctor, held for fifty years a unique 
position in. the life of the college community. In the 
same year the senior class brought out a second Annual 
Catalogue. The catalogue became thenceforth a regular 
college year-book, published by the seniors and containing 
information of interest to undergraduates, such as frater- 
nity lists and the like. In 1857, owing partly to the 
extravagance of the publication committee, as it was then 
considered, and partly to other considerations, the book 
was taken in hand by the Trustees, and out of it, under 
their official management, was developed the regular 
yearly catalogue of the University. 
Columbia’s next literary venture was made in connection 
with many other colleges, universities, and professional 
schools, in a publication styled the University Quarterly. 
This was a quarterly review of from one hundred and fifty to 
two hundred pages and was conducted from New Haven by 
“An Association of Collegiate and Professional Students 
in the United States and Europe.” It published essays, 
literary, historical, educational, and “news articles” for 
the various institutions represented. The first Columbia 
article appeared in the number of April, 1860, and was an 
historical and educational sketch of Columbia College by 
J. Howard Van Amringe, the Columbia editor, who was 
thenasenior. Subsequent articles by Columbia men were 
news articles by W. F. Whitehouse, E. Walter West, and 
C. Sigourney Knox; an article by this last-named con- 
tributor in July, 1861, is particularly interesting because 
of the picture it gives of Columbia in the early war time. 
Essays were contributed on Academie Ethics (anonymous) ; 
the Library of Columbia College, by W. A. Jones, A.M.,

   178 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1867 Librarian ; the Columbia College Law School, by Professor 
Theodore W. Dwight, LL.D. ; and American Colleges, by 
Abraham Suydam. The Quarterly, though apparently 
well received, ended with its second volume in 1861. 
In 1864, a publication similar in purpose and character 
to the Catalogue, but more meagre and modest in size and 
appearance, was started by the junior class, the class of 
’65, under the name of the Columbian. This title was 
changed next year to the Columbiad, and so continued till 
1890. In 1868 the publication was changed from a four- 
page sheet to book form. In 1878 the School of Mines, 
which had formerly codperated with the College in editing 
the Columbiad, started a similar publication of its own, 
the Miner. These two books ran a parallel course, as 
illustrated handbooks of undergraduate affairs, until 1890, 
when the two books were reunited in one — the Columbian. 
The Columbian continues to be published yearly by the 
junior class of the College and the third year class of the 
Schools of Applied Science, the former supplying whatso- 
ever of a literary character pertains to the book, and the 
latter, through the School of Architecture, the pictures 
which have at times been so remarkable for beauty and 
originality as to gain the Columbian a unique place among 
college publications. 
The first real undergraduate literary publication at 
Columbia was Cap and Gown, begun in 1867 and issued 
once a month. It had the double purpose of recording 
and commenting on Columbia affairs, and developing 
undergraduate literary expression. In 1873 the School 
of Mines was given editorial representation and the name 
of the paper was changed to Acta Columbiana. This 
paper, first a monthly, then a fortnightly, and soon after- 
ward a tri-weekly, continued until 1885 when it was 
absorbed by an offshoot from the parent stem, the Colum- 
bia Spectator. Acta Columbiana played an important part 
in its day. It was the first Columbia paper to have an     
-P-A-G-E-241
COLLEGE LIFE 179 
office of its own. This was secured in 1876, a part of 1880 
the coat-room having been boarded off for this purpose in 
the old building, irreverently called “ Maison de Punk.” 
The Acta office was at first unpopular with the student 
body that resented the sequestration of any part of its 
common property for the private use of an editorial 
board. However, after there had been some hard fight- 
ing about the walls of the little sanctum, the editors were 
left in undisturbed possession, and their office became a 
favorite meeting-place of the students. Acta’s best period 
was from 1880 to 1883 or thereabouts, and during that 
period it afforded an admirably vivacious expression of 
Columbia life and spirit. -Acta’s articles had consider- 
able literary merit, particularly the verse, which was 
widely quoted. Among the editors and contributors 
were: Harry Thurston Peck, John Kendrick Bangs, 
William Ordway Partridge, Frank Dempster Sherman, 
Nicholas Murray Butler, and John B. Pine, besides many 
other prominent Professors, University officers, and men 
of letters. 
Spectator was started as a fortnightly by two former 
editors of Acta—Mr. Frederic W. Holls, class of 78, 
and Mr. H. G. Paine, class of ’80. Spectator was 
primarily a newspaper, but early developed an artistic 
side in its cartoons and society sketches in the manner 
of George du Maurier. The best of the pictures were 
collected in 1882 into a book entitled College Cuts, which 
was dedicated to Du Maurier, and which ran through 
two editions. In 1885 Spectator absorbed Acta and took 
its motto —“A Studentibus Studentibusque.” Since then 
it has had two transitory rivals as a Columbia newspaper : 
Blue and White, 1891, and Columbia News, 1891 to 18938. 
Until 1892, when the Literary Monthly was founded, it 
was the literary publication of the students as well. 
When crowded out of the field of letters by a true maga- 
zine, it became more decidedly a newspaper, thus fulfilling 
 
-P-A-G-E-242
   180 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1898 the aims of its founders. In the spring of 1898 Spectator 
   became a weekly and one year later a semi-weekly. At 
the same time with this last change the publication aban- 
doned its blue-and-white covers and took on the modern 
newspaper form. In 1902 it became a daily paper, and 
succeeded, in a short time, in installing its own printing 
press in the basement of the old building styled “ College 
Hall.” It has a large clientele, as a thousand or more 
students now lodge in neighboring houses and live near 
the grounds, that promises to become larger with the 
erection of college dormitories, the coming year, on the 
newly acquired “ South Field.” 
There are three active undergraduate literary societies : 
Société Frangaise, Deutscher Verein, and King’s Crown. 
Société Francaise, founded in 1897, holds during the sea- 
son fortnightly meetings, at which French only is spoken, 
and presents, from time to time, a French play at the Col- 
lege. Deutscher Verein, founded in 1898, has a large 
active membership, cultivates the German Language and 
German University customs, and occasionally gives recep- 
tions to distinguished German visitors. In the spring of 
1904 it gave on the College grounds a Kommers to the 
German Minister, Baron Speck von Sternburg, his suite, 
and invited guests. King’s Crown, founded in 1898, has 
a large membership from the three upper college classes. 
It aims not only at codperation with the English literature 
courses, but at being a great undergraduate club as well. 
It holds two meetings every month during the academic 
year. The first of these is a purely society meeting, at 
which are discussed literary subjects and topics of present 
College interest; the second is an open meeting, to which 
the other undergraduate societies are usually invited, and 
which is addressed in an informal way by some gentleman 
of literary repute invited for the purpose. The list of 
such speakers contains some of the most prominent names 
in contemporary American letters. After the address

1869 there is a social meeting, with a modest collation, 
impromptu speeches, and the hearty singing of college 
songs. This society has general management of the 
“’Varsity Show” —a dramatic and musical entertain- 
ment, which consists of a play composed and performed 
by students, and constitutes one of the chief under- 
graduate events of the college year. 
An associate of the late George William Curtis in the 
work of Civil Service Reform established at Columbia a 
fund from the income of which two medals, called “ Cur- 
tis Medals,” one of gold and one of silver, are annually 
awarded to College students for excellence in the delivery 
of English orations. The general conduct of the public 
competition for these medals, first awarded in the spring 
of 1904, was committed to King’s Crown. The society 
hopes and expects to make of it a social affair of moment, 
recalling in this way the “Semi-annual Exhibitions” of 
student oratory that played so important and agreeable a 
part in the undergraduate life of the late fifties and many 
subsequent years. 
The fraternity system has grown apace. In addition to 
chapters of Alpha Delta Phi, Psi Upsilon, Delta Phi, and 
Delta Psi, before mentioned, chapters of a dozen or more 
others! have been formed. Several of the Fraternities own 
or rent houses in the neighborhood of the College, in which 
members reside. A chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, the schol- 
arship society of the college world, was established in Col- 
umbia in 1869. It has a vigorous existence. The annual 
meeting of the Columbia Chapter is held during Com- 
mencement Week. Members and officers are then elected, 
an address is delivered, and a dinner is served. 
Among other interesting and useful student organiza- 
tions are the Glee and Mandolin Clubs ; the Philharmonic 
Society ; the Society of Nacoms, a senior society, which 
aims to foster a high college spirit and a hearty college 
1 See Appendix D. 
 
-P-A-G-E-245

life ; the Churchman’s Association, and the Young Men’s 1901 
Christian Association. The last named, after some years 
of desuetude, was revived in 1894. It has general charge 
of Earl Hall, a building erected in 1901 through the gen- 
erosity of the late William E. Dodge that “religion may 
go hand in hand with learning, and character grow with 
knowledge,” holds meetings and sociables throughout the 
year, maintains relations with the Students Club of New 
York, sends delegates to the “ Northfield Conference,” and 
concerns itself with meeting newly arrived students, aid- 
ing them in getting suitable living places and making 
them feel at home and among friends. 
Before the removal of the College from 49th Street, 
Commencement was a matter of attraction and interest 
to but a limited number of alumni, and it had gradually 
come about that the graduating class had but little to do 
except to exhibit themselves and receive their degrees. 
A very salutary change has taken place and the whole 
affair has become more enjoyable and important. On 
Sunday of Commencement Week there is, in the Gymna- 
sium, a baccalaureate sermon by a distinguished preacher, 
with fine vocal and instrumental music, and an attendance 
of some two thousand persons including the graduating 
classes and the faculties. On Monday, the seniors have a 
Class Day which, so far as the budding graduates are con- 
cerned, largely replaces the old-time Commencement. The 
elections to Phi Beta Kappa are announced, chosen 
orators, poets, and prophets discourse on the past, present, 
and future of the class and its members, the class yew 
tree is planted on the green with much ceremony, and 
the class song is sung. In the evening there is a ball given 
in the Gymnasium by the graduating class, the grove is 
illuminated, and “joy is unconfined.” And, further, the 
spacious and beautiful grounds at Morningside Heights, 
the fine buildings, the nearness to the Hudson River and 
the “Edwin Gould” Boat-House, the great open spaces, the 
 
-P-A-G-E-246
   184 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1904 remoteness from the busier parts of the town, and the 
   air of academic seclusion, attract to the College for Com- 
mencement Day a large and annually increasing number of alumni who set apart the whole day for the purpose. After the formal exercises, a luncheon is served in Alumni Memo- 
rial Hall, at which brief speeches are made by recipients 
of honorary degrees and the President of the University. 
After the lunch, during the rest of the afternoon and the 
evening, class reunions and College gatherings are held. It goes without saying that this radical change conduces 
greatly to the welfare of the College by drawing closer the bonds of association of the alumni with each other and with their common Alma Mater. 
Two societies of alumni have benefited by the heightened interest in College matters occasioned by the new and im- proved environment — the Association of the Alumni of 
Columbia College and the Columbia University Club. The Alumni Association had a fitful existence for many years till 1860, since which time it has had regular meet- ings and has been continuously active in promoting the welfare of the College. For thirty years the Association, 
by social and business meetings, by discussion, and by reports of its Standing Committee, made the alumni and 
others familiar with the doings of the College, its course 
of study and the changes therein, the character and effi- 
ciency of the instruction and discipline, its financial con- 
dition and needs, the educational advantages that it offered, 
and the improvements that were desirable and feasible ; and, during those years and since, has had much to do 
with effecting and maintaining the relations of frank con- fidence that exist between the College and the public, and with enhancing the affectionate loyalty to Columbia 
of her sons. 
The Columbia University Club has grown up within three years. In August, 1901, about two hundred alumni organized the Club, and, in the following month, had it   
  
-P-A-G-E-247
   COLLEGE LIFE 185 
incorporated. It now has a membership of over eight 1904 
hundred, which is steadily increasing, and has, on lease _ 
for a term of years, a beautiful, commodious, and well- 
equipped club-house overlooking Madison Square. It 
provides rooms for meetings of alumni committees on col- _ 
lege and university matters, has a growing library of Co- 
lumbiana, maintains a good restaurant, provides dinners 
for class reunions, enters heartily into the life of the 
undergraduates by encouraging them and aiding them 
in their various local and intercollegiate enterprises, and 
has become a centre of generous activity and wholesome 
influence in the affairs of Columbia.

the following are from New York papers of April 20 : — 
From the Tribune : — 
“The prestige of a great educational institution was 
recognized on Morningside Heights yesterday afternoon 
when Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler was installed as the 
new President of Columbia University. Decorous pag- 
eantry, graceful oratory, and the presence of a great com- 
pany of prominent people helped to make the importance 
of Columbia as a seat of learning more conspicuous. ‘The 
President of the United States, a personal friend of Dr. 
Butler, was an honored guest at the installation. The 
Governor of the state of New York, the Mayor of the 
city of New York, other high public officials, presidents 
of many American universities and colleges, and men of 
prominence walked in the procession and listened to the 
addresses. Enthusiasm over the ceremonies was increased 
by perfect weather. The sunshine that flooded the campus 
seemed to pervade the great assemblage. Thousands of 
New Yorkers, who were uninvited and were kept back 
from the grounds of the university, formed crowds and 
watched the parade at a distance. Throughout the cere- 
monial there was manifested the warmest interest in the 
institution.” 
From the Times: — 
“Jn the presence of the President of the United States 
and of an academic company such as has seldom before 
gathered together in this country, Doctor Nicholas Mur- 
ray Butler was yesterday afternoon formally installed as 
the President of Columbia University to succeed Seth 
Low, who resigned to become Mayor of this city. The 
occasion was pointed out as unique in many respects. 
Tt was remarkable from the fact that it was one of the few 
occasions in the history of the country upon which the 
President of the nation has been the guest of honor and 
listened for nearly three hours to speechmaking, while 
he himself was not called upon to utter a word. Presi- 
dent Roosevelt manifested his thorough enjoyment of the 
exercises, however, by his applause, his attention, his 
laughter, and, upon one occasion, his very decided gesture 1902 
 
-P-A-G-E-252

1902 of delight. The occasion was unique in the fact that it 
   marked the coming together upon the platform of a uni- versity of the President of the United States, the Governor of the State, and the Mayor of this city —and all of them former students of that institution. President Roosevelt is a graduate of Harvard, but he studied law at Columbia. It was the first time, also, since the first year of Washing- ton’s administration, that a President of the United States has paid an official visit to Columbia University.” ‘““As an academic pageant, those who witnessed yester- day the installation of President Butler are ready to bear witness that New York has never offered anything ap- proaching to it. The weather was all that could be hoped for, and much more than could be reasonably expected on the 19th of April. Though the hall in which the exercises took place is provisional and to be superseded in due time by the University Theatre for such purposes as it served yesterday, it is by no means an unimpressive or an undignified interior. It is ample in dimensions, not, of course, to accommodate all who desired to see the installa. tion, but to hold all that it can accommodate, and, it may be added, to accommodate all that it wili hold. Tickets were issued for no more than the place would seat with conven. ience and dignity, and every guest could well see and hear all that went on. The same good judgment which presided over the issue of tickets was brought to bear on all details of the arrangement. Everything went off perfectly and punctually because everything had been carefully thought out beforehand. And the procession not only had those elements of intellectual interest which belong to every assemblage of the eminent and wise; it was also very well worth looking at merely as a spectacle. This is hardly the occasion on which to review the speeches of the installation, of which naturally the most important and inviting was that in which the new President made his educational profession of faith. But the spirit that breathed through all the speeches was that of congratula- tion and jubilation that the greatest city in the country had vindicated its claim to be regarded as the seat of one of the great universities of the country.” 
The Installation Dinner given by the alumni to Presi- dent Butler took place at Sherry’s on the evening of the  
-P-A-G-E-253
PRESIDENT BUTLER 189 
day of his induction into office, and was attended by 192 
over five hundred persons, including many distinguished 
guests. 
The walls of the dining room were draped from ceiling 
to floor on all sides of the room with the white-and-blue 
colors of the University. A broad band of blue extended 
from end to end of each table, on which were quantities 
of white flowers. The menus were printed on rough- 
edged paper of the same colors. At the head of the room 
over the dais was the flag of blue and white bearing the 
seal of the University and on each side of it were Ameri- 
can flags ; and around the room, on walls and on pillars, 
were the flags of other American universities, California, 
Chicago, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, Michigan, Princeton, 
Tulane, Virginia, Wisconsin, Yale, and others. 
Every class from 1840 to 1901 was represented among 
the alumni present, and an impromptu glee club made up 
of the younger graduates led the singing. 
Professor Van Amringe, of the class of 60, presided. 
Addresses were made by the President of the United 
States, the Mayor of the city of New York, Justice Wil- 
lard Bartlett, of the Supreme Court of New York, Dr. 
Albert Shaw, Editor of the Review of Reviews, President 
Pritchett of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 
President Alderman of Tulane University of Louisiana, 
and President Butler. 
The whole occasion, installation and banquet, was one 
of very great interest, and was characterized throughout 
by hearty enthusiasm for the new President and devoted 
loyalty on the part of the alumni to Columbia of which he 
had been made the honored chief. 
Said President Patton, in his address, “I congratulate 
the Trustees of Columbia University on their choice of 
one for the presidency of this institution who has not 
only given abundant proof of his administrative ability, 
 
-P-A-G-E-254
   190 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1902 but has also placed the great army of educators in Amer- 
   ica under a lasting debt of obligation by his contributions 
to the study of some of the leading problems of educa- 
tion.” “I consider it a good omen that the Trustees of 
this university have chosen a philosopher to fill the presi- 
dential chair. For be the facts what they may, which 
come under the notice of the student, it is the philosopher, 
the apostle of the idea, who is needed to make these dry 
bones live.” “Your learning and your self-sacrificing 
enthusiasm,” telegraphed President Draper of the Univer- 
sity of Illinois, “have made you personally known to 
more people in the West than any other eastern leader 
in our American education.” Commissioner Harris stated 
in his address : — 
“For you, sir, who come to-day to succeed a long line of distinguished presidents in this venerable seat of learn- ing, you have for many years made yourself a welcome 
member of the National Association of Teachers and aided its deliberations by your counsels. You have endeared 
yourself to its members by your frank and cordial fellow- ship. From the first you have associated yourself with that goodly number of leaders in higher education in our land who have realized how important it is to con- duct even the most elementary education of the people in the light of the highest and best in human learning. You have labored for the enlightenment of the masses and you have seen that this enlightenment must come, not from a people’s school which gives possession of a limited number of technical acquirements, skilled ma- nipulation, and trained facilities, but rather from a school 
which opens to the minds of the children a vision of the far-off shining summits of human achievement in letters, and art, and in heroic service to humanity.” 
And President Alderman, in his felicitous speech at the 
dinner, said : 
“Founders conceive, inaugurate, define —successors strengthen, administer, adjust, perpetuate. The great leaders who have wrought such wholesome change in the  
-P-A-G-E-255

conception of the American university, the amazing quarter 1902 
of a century through which we have just passed, are still 
with us in the serene unfailing youth of men who think 
clearly, will resolutely, and work joyfully toward good 
ends. But the dawn is always searching for its heralds, 
and I salute your president and my friend, crowned with 
difficulty and with opportunity, as one of these heralds, 
as the wielder of one of the greatest forces in American 
life. I was, by chance, in a little city in northern Louisi- 
ana, when it was announced that Columbia had chosen 
her president. ‘An earnest little woman came to me there, 
and said she was glad, because he had helped her in the 
kindergarten movement; a perplexed preacher said he 
was glad, because he had helped him in rational Sunday- 
school instructions ; a school superintendent said he was 
glad, because he had helped him in his particular tasks. 
I knew very well that I had been strengthened by his 
counsel, and the whole unusual incident seemed to me 
to work the final definition of a college president as a 
man with much to give, with a passion for giving it, with 
a genius of sympathy and insight into the educational 
process as one whole thing from primary school to 
university.” 
President Butler has been so long connected with the 
College as student and officer, and was so largely influen- 
tial in the re-formation and improvements which have 
been brought about, that no material change in general 
policy has yet been made. He has suggested important 
modifications of the curriculum and had them long and 
earnestly discussed by the faculty ; he has reconstituted, 
in a measure, the teaching staff, advancing many of the 
younger officers and adding some distinguished names 
to the several faculties; he has manifested his hearty 
sympathy with the students, not only in their strictly 
academic labors, but also in all the extracurricular activ- 
ities that play so important a part in the formation of 
sterling character aimed at by a collegiate education. 
During the three years since he became acting President, 
the gifts in money to Columbia have exceeded $3,000,000 
 
-P-A-G-E-256
    192 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
“1903. and there have been added to the four blocks occupied 
by the University the two city blocks immediately south 
of them, known as “South Field,” on a portion of which 
the corner-stones of “ Hartley Hall,” a college dormitory, 
for which the sum of $350,000 was given by Marcellus 
Hartley Dodge, of the class of 1908, and his aunt, Mrs. 
Helen Hartley Jenkins, and a second dormitory to be 
erected by the Trustees, are to be laid on October 31, 
1904, the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the 
founding of the College. 
He has set himself, more suo, with promptitude and 
clearness of vision, to solve three great and pressing 
problems : — 
The financial problem—« Columbia University, as now organized and equipped, may be likened to a giant in bonds. Strength, power, zeal for service are all at hand, but the bonds of insufficient funds hold them in on every side. In plainest language, Columbia University in 1902 is without adequate grounds and buildings and without sufficient income to care properly for the work that has already been undertaken, even if not a single extension of the work now in progress be planned. Columbia College, in which 492 undergraduates have been enrolled in 1901-1902, is without any building whatever for aca- demic purposes, and the instructors and students are temporarily assigned to most unsuitable and inadequate quarters.” The administrative problem —“In almost every case the university administration of to-day is merely an expansion of the methods and the machinery charac- teristic of the administration of the small colleges of yesterday out of which the universities have grown. Ad- ministrative work has been done by teachers in active ser- vice, and either as deans or as members of important 
committees they have divided their time between their books and laboratories and their classes on the one hand and their office duties on the other.” “The wisest tendency in administrative development is, I am sure, to relieve 
teachers and investigators from every unnecessary demand upon their time and strength.” ‘The educational problem —   
-P-A-G-E-257
 
-P-A-G-E-258

-P-A-G-E-259
PRESIDENT BUTLER 193 
“Not a few matters of importance have been definitely 1903 
settled at Columbia during the past twenty years, and 
settled, I believe, in almost every case, with wisdom and 
in accordance with sound principle. For example, it is 
settled policy at Columbia (1) that the requirements for 
admission to the freshman class of Columbia College shall 
not be raised beyond the point where they can be met by 
the student who has had a normal secondary school course 
of four years; (2) that these requirements, and those for 
admission to the Schools of Applied Science, the College of 
Physicians and Surgeons, Barnard College, and_Teachers 
College as well, shall be stated in terms of the definitions 
formulated by the representative organizations of teachers 
of the several subjects, and administered, in codperation 
with other colleges and with secondary schools, through the 
College Entrance Examination Board; (3) that a just bal- 
ance shall be maintained between prescribed and elective 
studies in the undergraduate course, the student being in 
every case guided or supervised in his selection of subjects ; 
(4) that Columbia College shall offer but a single degree, 
that of Bachelor of Arts, and that that degree shall repre- 
sent the elements of a liberal education as it is conceived 
and defined by the Faculty of Columbia College ; (5) that 
the several technical and professional schools shall rest 
upon a college course (though not necessarily one four 
years in length) as a foundation, either at once —as in 
the case of the School of Law — or as soon as practicable 
—as in the case of the Schools of Applied Science and 
of Medicine; and (6) that all possible means shall be 
taken to shorten the time in which a college degree and 
a professional or technical degree may be taken, by co- 
operation between the Faculty of Columbia College and 
the Faculties of Law, Medicine, Applied Science, and 
Teachers College. 
“ Significant as these matters are, and seriously as they 
affect the relations of Columbia University to the public 
welfare, there are still others which claim attention and 
which yield to none in importance. Of these I may men- 
tion at this time five: The maintenance of educational 
efficiency ; the promotion of research; the better organ- 
ization of the teaching of the natural sciences; the de- 
velopment of the social side of academic life through the 
provision of dormitory accommodations for students ; and 
o 
 
-P-A-G-E-260
194 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1903 the length of the College course and the relation of that 
course to the rest of the work of the University.” ! 
The “College, which is the oldest part of Columbia 
University, and in a sense the mother of all the rest,” is 
sure of the President’s sympathetic interest and cordial 
support : — 
“The college, as we have it, is peculiar to our national 
system of education, and is perhaps its strongest, as it 
certainly is its most characteristic, feature. It breaks 
the sharp transition which is so noticeable in Europe be- 
tween the close surveillance and prescribed order of the 
secondary school and the absolute freedom of the Uni- 
versity. Its course of liberal study comes just at the 
time in the student’s life to do him most good, to open 
and inform his intelligence, and to refine and strengthen 
his character. Its student life, social opportunities, and 
athletic sports are all additional elements of usefulness 
and of strength. It has endeared itself to three or four 
generations of the flower of our American youth, and it 
is more useful to-day than at any earlier time. I am 
anxious to have it preserved as part of our educational 
system and so adjusted to the social and educational 
conditions which surround us that a college training may 
be an essential part of the higher education of an Ameri- 
can whether he is destined to a professional career or to a 
business occupation.” “I find myself in hearty agreement 
with the recently expressed opinion of President Jordan 
of Stanford University that ‘in the long run, the greatest 
University will be the one that devotes the most care to 
its undergraduates,’ and for that reason I believe that too 
much care and attention cannot be given to the students 
in Columbia College.’’? 
The alumni of Columbia College hope, therefore, and 
expect that their alma mater, dedicated one hundred and 
fifty years ago to the instruction of youth in the learned 
languages and in the liberal arts and sciences, to the pro- 
motion of religion and learning, will steadily advance in

dignity, usefulness, and power, ever striving to realize the 1903 
ideal eloquently expressed by President Butler in his in- 
augural address : “It keeps step with the march of prog- 
ress, widens its sympathies with growing knowledge, and 
among a democratic people seeks only to instruct, to up- 
lift, and to serve, in order that the cause of religion and 
learning and of human freedom and opportunity may be 
continually advanced from century to century and from 
age to age.”

THE UNIVERSITY AND NON-PROFESSI ONAL 
GRADUATE SCHOOLS 
CHAPTER I 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY 
WueEn we speak to-day of universities in the United 
States, we use the term in a somewhat novel sense, for 
the American universities are not precisely analogous to 
those of England or of France or of Germany. The 
American university may include more than one college 
of the English type, but it is not, like the English 
university, primarily a collection of colleges. The Amer- 
ican university includes and administers a number of 
separate schools, collegiate, professional, and technologi- 
cal, and these are more or less independent in their or- 
ganization and activity; but it is not, like the French 
university, merely a name for the central direction and 
control of these educational units. The American uni- 
versity, finally, may have all, and always has some, of the 
traditional university faculties of continental Europe — 
theology, law, medicine, and philosophy; but these are 
not yet generally correlated, as in Germany, either with 
the collegiate course or with one another. Moreover the 
American university, which in most cases has grown up 
about a collegiate nucleus, retains the college. It has 
not, like the German university, abandoned to the pre- 
paratory school or gymnasium all the disciplinary years 
of general education. It is also more catholic in its 
199 
 
-P-A-G-E-266
200 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1904 readiness to recognize new professions and to organize 
new professional faculties. To the American mind it 
has not seemed reasonable to exclude from the university 
the applied sciences of agriculture, forestry, metallurgy, 
industrial chemistry, and the higher branches of engi- 
neering, nor to refuse academic recognition to pharmacy 
or dentistry or veterinary medicine. The. American uni- 
versity has been not only willing but eager to organize or 
annex new professional schools as fast as new vocations 
have approached the scientific level; it already includes 
schools to train schoolmasters and journalists. It is 
attempting to develop a faculty of the fine arts, which 
shall embrace music, painting, and sculpture; and it is 
considering, not whether architecture shall be included 
among university studies, but whether it shall be treated 
as a branch of engineering, or as an art, or as a peculiar 
combination of art and applied science. In many, perhaps 
in most instances, the American university is still rather 
an aggregation than a symmetrically articulated organiza- 
tion; but some of the leading universities are becoming 
educational as well as administrative unities. 
So numerous are the institutions in the United States 
which have added to collegiate training some of these varied 
educational activities; so much do they vary in the range 
of their efforts and in the size of their teaching forces and 
student bodies; so different, under the unchecked play of 
individual initiative, are the forms of organization thus 
far developed and the degrees of correlation thus far 
attained, that no two experts would be likely to give 
the same answer to the questions: what are the essential 
elements of the American university ? and which of the 
existing institutions are really entitled to bear the name ? 
Still less agreement would probably be discovered if it were 
inquired: which are at present the leading American uni- 
versities? And yet certain points of agreement are emerg- 
ing. The American university should have at least three 
 
-P-A-G-E-267
  THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY 201 
of the traditional European faculties, and among these 1904 
three should be a faculty of philosophy — or, as we have 
styled it and continue with increasing inaccuracy to style 
it, a non-professional graduate school. The American 
university should also be sufficiently American to include 
training in some of the newer professions, particularly 
in the chief branches of engineering. Above all, the 
American university must not only cherish and transmit 
knowledge; it must also help to increase knowledge and 
to extend its applications. Among the institutions that 
fulfil these conditions, the leading universities are those 
which have the largest bodies of teachers who are also 
investigators, and which attract, not by the maintenance 
of low standards and the bestowal of easy degrees but by 
the educational opportunities they offer and the scientific 
prestige they have attained, the largest number of stu- 
dents. A comparison based on these assumptions will 
show that at the present time (1904) there are in the 
United States nearly a dozen institutions that may fairly 
be regarded as universities, and that from every point of 
view Columbia has become one of the two leading univer- 
sities of the country. It has, at the present time, the 
largest teaching force. It has the largest body of stu- 
dents, if college undergraduates are excluded from the 
count; the second largest body of students, if college 
undergraduates are included.1 It is second to no other 
American (or English) university in the encouragement 
of research or in literary and scientific production. 
The development of American universities has taken 
place, in the main, during the past half century. The 
leading universities of the East have been formed by grad- 
ual accretion about the nuclei of older colleges. Of these

17, 1902; reprinted in the Columbia University Quarterly, June, 1902,

in the size of its teaching force. In 1903 it took the first place.

1904 Columbia was almost the last, not indeed to attempt, but 
to achieve the beginnings of university development. Dur- 
ing its first century of existence no effort to widen its ac- 
tivities had been permanently successful. In its hundred 
and fourth year it was still a small college, with only a 
dozen instructors and about one hundred and fifty stu- 
dents. During its fifth quarter of a century it gained 
three professional schools: two of its own creation, the 
Schools of Law and of Mines, the third by a treaty of alli- 
ance with the College of Physicians and Surgeons. All 
these throve and grew strong. Within the School of 
Mines there developed other schools of applied science. 
Law and science, however, were unrelated to the College 
or to one another, and the union with the College of Phy- 
sicians and Surgeons was merely nominal. At the close 
of this second period Columbia was hardly a university; 
it was an interesting and promising aggregation of nearly 
a hundred instructors and fourteen hundred students. 
In its sixth quarter of a century (1880-1904), Co- 
lumbia established three graduate schools of non-profes- 
sional instruction and research; put its Law School on 
a graduate basis, and lengthened the law course to three 
years ; brought its School of Medicine into real union 
with the rest of the University, raised the standard of 
admission here also, and extended the medical course to 
four years ; increased by further specialization of courses 
the number of its schools of applied science ; added to 
them a School of Architecture, separated it from them 
and placed it with music in an inchoate faculty of fine 
arts ; established such relations of reciprocity with the 
principal theological seminaries of New York City as to 
make these institutions, as far as the free movement of 
students is concerned, portions of its educational system ; 
gained, by treaties of affiliation, a second undergraduate 
college, for women, and an additional professional school, 
for the training of teachers ; and developed a large summer
-P-A-G-E-269
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY 203 
school. In its one hundred and fiftieth year the Univer- 1904 
sity (a title first assumed in 1896) had a teaching force of 
455 and a resident student body of 4709. 
During this period of expansion Columbia has extended 
its connections and its influence to a degree which mere 
figures of registration in no wise indicate. It has organ- 
ized through Teachers College a promising system of uni- 
versity (or more properly of collegiate) extension teach- 
ing. It has established such relations with the Museum 
of Natural History, with the New York Botanical Garden, 
and with the Metropolitan Art Museum, as to make all 
the treasures of these institutions available for its own 
students of the natural sciences and of the fine arts ; and 
such relations with the public and private charities of 
New York as to give to its students of social science 
abundant practical training, and to open to them limitless 
fields of research. To these and other public and benevyo- 
lent institutions the University contributes in return ex- 
pert counsel and assistance ; and it codperates with them 
in scientific investigation, popular education, and further- 
ance of the general welfare. At the end of its hundred 
and fiftieth year the University is in closer touch than 
ever before with the intellectual, artistic, and ethical life 
of the metropolis. At the same time, by the widening 
area from which its students are drawn, by the increasing 
number of its graduates who hold teaching positions in the 
schools, colleges, and universities of every section of the 
United States, and by its increasing contributions to scien- 
tific literature, it has become, as never before, a national 
force and a factor in the intellectual life of the world. 
Why was this development, which of recent years has 
been so rapid, so late in its beginning and so slow in its 
early progress? The current theory, that the earlier 
administration of Columbia was unprogressive, is as in- 
correct as is the common impression on which this theory 
is based, that Columbia was from the outset a rich college, 
 
-P-A-G-E-270
204 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1904 It is easy to contradict misstatements, but it is hard to 
correct false impressions. ‘Twenty-two years ago, in his 
report of 1882, President Barnard showed that, even as 
a college, Columbia had not been financially prosperous 
until 1867. In the early years of the nineteenth century 
the income from its property was about $14,000. To 
keep the College running, its Trustees were repeatedly 
obliged to borrow money. In 1857 the College debt 
amounted to $166,000, and the net income from its 
property (interest and other charges deducted) was only 
$23,000. The debt was not extinguished until 1872. In 
1882, as President Barnard pointed out, Columbia was a 
well-to-do college, indeed, but a poor university. At that 
time it had already engaged in university enterprises which 
soon required new borrowings. Nor has Columbia ever 
received adequate assistance from private benefactions. 
Until the closing decade of the nineteenth century the sum 
total of gifts and bequests to the College was absurdly 
small. New York took little interest in its old College 
because that College did not grow rapidly; and the growth 
of the University was arrested because the College did not 
gain the active sympathies of New York. 
That the authorities of Columbia have at all times been 
solicitous for its advancement, that they have repeatedly 
striven, not merely according to their means but beyond 
their means, to widen the scope and raise the plane of its 
teaching, is made abundantly clear by the records of the 
old College. If it were only to demonstrate this fact, it 
would be worth while to trace the history of the univer- 
sity idea at Columbia, through its failures as well as its 
successes. The story, however, is worth the telling for 
its own sake

chiefly on Professor Van Amringe’s ‘‘ History of Columbia University,” 
published in Universities and their Sons, For the entire collegiate period

Noteworthy at the outset is the prospectus composed by 
President Samuel Johnson, and published June 3, 1754. 
It included not only the ordinary subjects of the con-

logic, rhetoric, and mathematics, but also “ surveying and

commerce, and government, and .. . the knowledge of 
all nature . . . and of everything useful for the comfort, 
convenience, and elegance of life in the chief manufac- 
tures. . . .” This was to claim for the new College the 
entire field of the technological and of the non-profes- 
sional graduate schools of the modern university. It goes 
without saying that the greater part of this field remained 
untilled. The revised curriculum of 1763 was substan- 
tially a copy of that of Queen’s College, Oxford. From 
the beginning, however, and through the first century of 
Columbia’s existence, more attention was devoted to the 
natural sciences than was customary, at so early a period, 
in the English and American colleges; and Columbia 
was apparently the first of American colleges to provide 
systematic instruction in political economy. The first 
special professorship that was created (1757) was that of 
«mathematics and natural history.” The second (1762) 
was that of moral philosophy; and in 1818 the fifth occu- 
pant of this chair, Professor John MeVickar, was charged 
also with instruction in political economy. In his mas- 
terly review of the history of Columbia, published in his 
report of 1886, President Barnard indeed declared that 
during the first century of the College, the instruction in 
physics and chemistry was elementary, and that “natural 
history,” while it figured in the prospectus, was “ taught 
hardly more than in name.” Here, however, as in other 1754— 
1857

   1857 206 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1754- matters, it was not good-will but money that was lacking. 
In 1880 the Trustees established a “ scientific and literary 
course,” parallel to the classical course. At the same 
time they determined to establish sixteen public lecture- 
ships, with a range of topics extending over the fields of 
literature, philosophy, natural science, pure and applied, 
and the political sciences. The lectures were to be opened 
not only to matriculated students but to the public, on 
payment of a small fee for each course. The lectureships, 
however, were apparently to be maintained by the fees 
received from students, and few of them were even tem- 
porarily filled. In 1843 the literary and scientific course, 
which in its thirteen years had attracted but forty-nine 
students, was discontinued. 
Il. Efforts to develop professional education. — For pro- 
fessional instruction in theology, medicine, and law the 
Governors of King’s and the Trustees of Columbia College 
were from the beginning anxious to provide suitable 
opportunities. In the additional charter of 1755, pro- 
vision was made for a professorship of divinity, the in- 
cumbent of this chair to be appointed, from time to time, 
by the ministers, elders, and deacons of the Reformed 
Protestant Dutch Church in the city of New York. No 
appointment was ever made. In 1768 the Governors of 
King’s voted to establish a department of medical instruc- 
tion “as soon as their funds will enable them to do so.” 
In 1767 a Medical School was established with a Faculty 
of six professors, and in 1769 medical degrees “in course” 
were conferred upon two students. This was not the first 
medical school in America; that established in Phila- 
delphia antedated it by five years; but it was the first 
connected with a college, and it was the first to give de- 
grees in course. Its activity, like that of the College, was 
interrupted by the Revolution. When the College was 
reorganized under the name of Columbia, in 1784, the 
Regents of the University of the State of New York, to         
               
    
        
    
                           
-P-A-G-E-273
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY 207 
whom its government was committed, determined to estab- 1754- 
lish four faculties; viz., Arts, Medicine, Law, and Divinity. Bey 
The latter was to consist of such professorships as might be 
established by the different religious societies within the 
state. The law faculty was to be composed, at the outset, 
of three professors. Neither of these faculties came into 
existence. The Medical Faculty, however, was reéstab- 
lished as well as the Faculty of Arts; and when, in 1787, 
Columbia College was placed under the control of its own 
Trustees, the Medical School was carried on, as before the 
Revolution, as a part of the College. In 1792 it was re- 
organized, but in 1813 it was discontinued, its Faculty 
being absorbed by the independent College of Physicians 
and Surgeons, established in 1807. During its nominal 
existence of forty-six years and actual existence of thirty- 
eight years, the King’s-Columbia School of Medicine 
graduated thirty-five doctors. 
As early as 1773 the Governors of King’s created a 
professorship of natural law. The natural law theories 
prevalent at the time were decidedly revolutionary ; but 
the occupant of this chair, the Rev. John Vardill, was a 
Tory. It is not clear that he ever assumed the duties of 
his professorship; and it was discontinued in 1776. In 
1792, the legislature having granted to Columbia College 
an annual subsidy for a term of years for salaries of new 
professors, the Trustees decided that among others a pro- 
fessorship of law should be established ; and in 1793 
James Kent was appointed to this chair. In 1798 he 
resigned, and, as the legislative grant was not renewed, 
the professorship was discontinued. In 1828, however, 
Kent again became professor of law, and although in the 
later years of his life he delivered no lectures, he retained 
the chair until his death in 1847. His “Commentaries,” 
published 1826-1830, were the outcome of his professional 
activity. In 1848 William Betts was appointed professor 
of law. In 1854 he resigned and the professorship was 
 
-P-A-G-E-274
  208 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1754- again discontinued. At the close of Columbia’s first cen- 
tury there was, accordingly, no provision for professional 
education. 
Il. Efforts towards university organization. — The plan 
of 1784, by which Columbia College was to be the nucleus 
of a state university, with all the four traditional faculties, 
has been already noticed. As this programme was formu- 
lated by the State Regents during their brief control of 
the reorganized Columbia, their action does not, of itself, 
furnish any indication of the ideals and aspirations of the 
College. The plan was, however, anticipated, and per- 
haps suggested, by proposals which emanated from the 
Governors of King’s College ten years earlier. In the 
British archives! there still slumbers a proposed charter, 
establishing “The American University in the Province of 
New York.” This charter was drafted by order of the 
Governors of King’s College, was formally approved by 
them August 4, 1774; was forwarded by Lieutenant- 
Governor Cadwallader Colden to Governor William 
Tryon, then in England; and was by him submitted, 
February 17, 1775, to Earl Dartmouth, at that time 
principal secretary of state for the American department. 
Its chief provisions were that King’s College should be 
“the mother of the American University”; that King’s 
and all other colleges which should hereafter be erected 
within the province of New York should be members of a 
single university to be known as “ The American Univer- 
sity in the Province of New York”; that the government 
of the new University should be intrusted to a body of 
Regents; that this body should be constituted by adding 
to the existing Board of Governors of King’s College a 
number of new honorary Regents resident in the mother 
country, and by empowering the Governors resident in 
America to add so many inhabitants of the province of 
New York or of neighboring provinces as should make the

    THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY 209 
Regents amount to the number of fifty, exclusive of the 1754- 
official Regents resident in Great Britain and Ireland. 
The officers of the University were to be a chancellor and 
a vice-chancellor ; King’s College and each other college 
belonging to the University was to have a president and a 
vice-president. A sort of executive committee of twelve, 
to be styled the “ Academical Senate,” might be chosen by 
the Regents, and this Senate might be intrusted with the 
general control of university education and discipline. A 
“minor academical senate” might be created for the gov- 
ernment of any of the colleges; it should consist of the 
President and the several fellows, professors, and tutors, 
and should exercise such powers as the Regents might 
grant it. The corporation was to send two representa- 
tives to the General Assembly of the province; and the 
electoral body by which such representatives were to be 
chosen was to be composed of the Regents, professors, 
fellows, and tutors of the University, and of the masters 
of arts and other holders of superior degrees. 
The projected “American University” was clearly 
modelled on the English Universities ; it was to be a uni- 
versity of colleges. With the development of colleges 
locally separated, it might have approached the French 
type of university. The only hint in the proposed charter 
of university expansion in our modern American sense is 
to be found in a clause empowering the new University to 
grant “all such degrees, as well in philosophy and in the 
municipal law of England as in all and every other art, 
science, and faculty whatsoever, as are or may be conferred 
by all or any of the universities in England or in Ireland.” 
The charter was considerately put in such form that to 
become immediately effective it needed only the royal 
signature and seal—and the filling in of two blank 
spaces. One, of three lines, was left open for such new 
professorships as the King might see fit to found; the 
other, of two pages, for such new endowments as he might 
ts 
ee
-P-A-G-E-278
  210 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1858- graciously grant. It was clear to the Governors of King’s 
1879 that the American University would require large re- 
sources, and the charter itself provided that it might 
hold land up to the yearly value of £5000! 
Lieutenant-Governor Colden’s letter declares that, in 
view of the existing control of education by dissenters, 
not only in New England but likewise in New Jersey and 
other colonies, it seems requisite “that a seminary on the 
principles of the Church of England be distinguished in 
America by particular privileges, not only on account 
of religion, but of good policy, to prevent the growth of 
republican principles, which already too much prevail in 
the colonies.” Governor Tryon’s letter states that “ the 
attachment to his Majesty’s person and government which 
has always distinguished the Governors, professors, and 
members of King’s College renders them truly deserving 
of the royal attention and countenance.” 
The records! show that the King ordered, in April, 1775, 
that the proposed charter should be laid before him in 
Privy Council. Of its further history we know nothing, 
except that it was not signed. There were, at the time, 
more pressing American questions before his Majesty’s 
government; and his advisers may well have deemed it 
inopportune to complicate the political situation in New 
York by rekindling sectarian controversy. 
DEVELOPMENT OF PROFESSIONAL ScHOOLS (1858-1879) 
The addition to the College between 1858 and 1864 of a 
number of flourishing professional schools was the result 
of a new and carefully considered effort to develop ad- 
vanced. non-professional instruction. The plan was in a 
sense a renewal of that of 1880; but it was projected on 
broader lines, and it served in many respects as a model 
for the later and successful attempt of 1880-1892.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY 211 
In October, 1852, on the motion of President King, a 1858- 
committee was appointed to consider and report, among ere 
other matters, upon “the expediency of engrafting upon 
the foundation of this College a scheme of university pro- 
fessorships and lectures in the higher departments of letters 
and science.” Among other pending questions was that 
of the removal of the College from its old site ; and in 
October, 1853, a committee of three was chosen by ballot to 
consider the question of removal, 
“and, in the event of such removal, whether any and what 
changes ought to be made in the undergraduate course; and 
whether it would be expedient to establish a system of univer- 
sity education in addition to such undergraduate course, either 
in continuation thereof or otherwise.” 
The committee consisted of William Betts, Dr. Henry 
James Anderson, and the Hon. Hamilton Fish. A month 
later this committee presented a preliminary report. With 
regard to the establishment of university education, 
“[they] were not prepared to say more than that they re- 
garded it favorably in those respects in which it might be 
practicable, but that the design was not free from serious diffi- 
culties ; that the subject had occupied the minds of learned 
men in connection with the English universities, but hitherto 
without effect; that the medical and theological schools had 
done much, perhaps all, that could at present be done in that 
direction; but in regard to higher jurisprudence and the sciences 
and their application much might possibly be done by the 
college.” 
A year later, on November 6, 1854, resolutions regard- 
ing a graduate course of study were presented by this 
committee, to which in the meantime the Rev. Dr. John 
Knox had been added; and on November 23 the follow- 
ing resolutions were independently proposed : 
“ Resolved: That in view of its greatly enlarged resources, the 
College ought now to establish supplemental courses in continu- 
 
-P-A-G-E-280
  212 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1868- ation of the studies of the first three years, without reference 
1879 to professional or artistic pursuits, but solely for higher culture 
in learning and science, to extend for three additional years, 
with degrees, as at present, at the end of the first or senior 
year, with an unrestricted choice of studies during the two 
succeeding years. 
“« Resolved: That the College, as soon as its means will per- 
mit, may advantageously establish special and separate profes- 
sional and artistic schools in connection with the liberal arts 
and sciences to be taught in its general course.” 
On December 4, 1854, the consideration of both sets of 
resolutions was postponed “until the committee on the 
course shall report a statute.” Meanwhile through an- 
other committee, appointed in 1855 “to inquire into the 
condition of the institution,” a wide range of investigation 
was instituted, involving an examination of the President 
and all the professors in the College, and correspondence 
with eminent educators in all parts of the United States.t 
Among the latter was Francis Lieber, then professor of 
history, political economy, and philosophy in South Caro- 
lina College. The plan finally adopted coincided in many 
respects with his recommendations, but the main lines 
of that plan were apparently worked out before his views 
were elicited. The statute contemplated in the resolution 
of December 4, 1854, was reported March 2, 1857 ; con- 
sidered in committee of the whole and amended May 11 ; 
and adopted July 6. 
In view of later developments, it is interesting to note 
that the line between college and university work was 
drawn at the close of the junior year; up to that point 
there was to be a single prescribed course of study. The 
studies of the senior year were divided into three groups, 
—letters, science, and jurisprudence. For the further

THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY 213 
prosecution of the special studies thus initiated, graduate 1 
schools were established, as follows : 1 
“1. A school is established, called The School of Let- 
ters, in which shall be pursued the following studies : moral and mental philosophy, including an analysis of the 
moral and intellectual powers ; «esthetics, or the principles 
of taste and art; the history of philosophy ; appropriate 
literature of the Greeks and Romans; Oriental and 
modern languages, as far as possible; comparative phi- 
lology ; ethnology. 
“2. A school is established, called The School of Sci- 
ence, in which shall be pursued the following studies : 
mechanics and physics ; astronomy ; chemistry and min- 
eralogy ; geology and paleontology ; engineering ; min- 
ing and metallurgy ; arts of design; history of science ; 
natural history ; physical geography. 
“3. A school is established, called The School of Juris- 
prudence, in which shall be pursued the following studies : 
history ; political economy ; political philosophy ; the 
principles of natural and international law; civil and com- 
mon law; the writings of the Greeks and Romans, and of 
the modern civilians and jurists, appropriate to the last 
three subjects. 
«The conjunction of the above three schools shall form 
the University Course. 
“Any person who may enter either of the said schools 
may receive the degree of master of arts, after having 
pursued for a space of time not less than two years, to 
the satisfaction of the Trustees and Faculty, such of the 
studies thereof, and under such regulations, as the Trustees 
may from time to time prescribe. 
“There shall be fellowships, with or without stipends, 
to be filled by the Board of Trustees, upon such examina- 
tion, and upon such rules and regulations as may hereafter 
be prescribed.” 
In a public address Mr. Betts, the chairman of the com- 
mittee that prepared the statute, insisted upon the distinc- 
tion between the work of the first three years of the 
College course, and that of the senior and graduate years. 
Up to the close of the junior year, he said, “the end in 
    858— 
879
-P-A-G-E-282
  
214 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
  1858- view is mainly to discipline and invigorate the mind and 
1879 to enlighten and purify the heart.” From that period 
onward, 
“the object is to apply this intellectual light and vigor 
to the permanent acquisition of knowledge ; to emancipate 
the student gradually from the trammels of catechetical 
teaching, and to prepare him for the higher and more 
arduous efforts of self-instruction. With this view, three 
departments are constructed, which are termed schools of 
letters, of science, and of jurisprudence. ... On enter- 
ing the senior year, each student may select either of these 
schools. . . . 
« After graduation, the same schools are proposed to 
be continued for two years. A reference to the proposed 
course of instruction will show that: they comprehend a 
large circle of human learning. The instruction in these 
schools is not to be confined to the graduates of the Col- 
lege. It is open to the whole world. A sufficient body 
of teachers is provided to commence the undertaking. A 
nucleus is presented for a great university, adapted and 
prepared to meet all the wants of the community. If 
there be really that demand for the acquisition of knowl- 
edge which has been supposed, it may here be satisfied. 
If there be in fact no such demand, or such only to a 
limited extent, time will soon develop the truth. It is 
indeed hoped that the graduates of the College, animated 
by a noble and inspiring love of learning, will not fail to 
take advantage of the proposed means of instruction thus 
afforded to them, and that others will gradually be drawn 
to join them. 
“The progress of the undertaking may be slow ; it may 
be unsuccessful. The slowness of its progress need not, 
however, produce despair. Most things that are valuable 
and lasting are slow in progression. Time and experience 
will, however, soon demonstrate the utility of the attempt ; 
and it is so devised, that it may be expanded, contracted, 
or discontinued without difficulty.” 
The “sufficient body of teachers” was provided in part 
by the appointment of six additional professors in the 
College and in part by procuring the assistance of special 
 
-P-A-G-E-283
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY 215 
lecturers. The practical organization of the new Univer- 1858- 
sity courses was intrusted to a new committee, appointed 1878) 
March 8, 1858, which consisted of the Right Rev. Hora- 
tio Potter, William Betts, Samuel B. Ruggles, Gerrit G. 
Van Wagenen, and George F. Allen. By resolution of 
June 21, 1858, this committee was authorized to secure 
the services for a term not exceeding two years, of Pro- 
fessor James D. Dana (of Yale College), in the depart- 
ment of geology and natural history, of Professor Arnold 
Guyot (of the College of New Jersey) in physical geog- 
raphy, of Mr. George P. Marsh, in the English language, 
“at a compensation to each not exceeding $1500 annually; 
and of Professor Theodore W. Dwight, or such other compe- 
tent instructor as said committee may select, for the elemen- 
tary branch of the law department, to be compensated by 
fees to be guaranteed by the College to amount to $1500 
annually ; and of any other instructors in any department 
of jurisprudence, science, or letters presented by the 
statute, who will accept fees in full compensation.” 
The services of all those gentlemen were secured, but, 
owing to ill health, Professor Dana was prevented from 
delivering his lectures on geology. Dr. Torrey of the Col- 
lege of Physicians and Surgeons was engaged to lecture 
on botany. Of the newly appointed professors, Francis 
Lieber undertook to lecture on history and political 
science ; Charles Murray Nairne on philosophy and lit- 
erature; Charles Davies and William Guy Peck on 
mathematics ; Charles W. Hackley on astronomy, and 
Charles A. Joy on chemistry. With this force the Uni- 
versity lectures were begun in the autumn of 1858. The 
lectures in the scientific courses were given in the College 
buildings at 49th Street ; those in other subjects at the 
rooms of the Historical Society in Second Avenue near 
11th Street. 
Except in elementary law, these public lectures failed to 
secure such support as to justify their continuance. In 
 
-P-A-G-E-284
216 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1858- Professor Dwight, however, Columbia had secured the 
1878) greatest legal instructor of the time; and his lectures 
proved so attractive that his engagement was made per- 
manent. In 1864 he was made Warden of the Columbia 
Law School, a position which he retained until 1891. In 
establishing a department of law, in 1858, the Trustees had 
intended to make provision, primarily, for preparing stu- 
dents for admission to the bar; but it was also their inten- 
tion to provide instruction in other and higher branches, 
not absolutely necessary to such admission. Their hope in 
this was that “if a large number of students be drawn into 
the school, it will probably not be difficult to induce them 
to attend the superadded studies and thereby acquire that 
more elevated learning which it is the object of the Col- 
lege to extend.” In the early years of the school, Pro- 
fessor Lieber gave instruction in public law, Professor 
Nairne in the ethics of jurisprudence, Professor John Or- 
dronaux in medical jurisprudence; and several eminent 
members of the bar, including William M. Evarts, were 
enlisted as lecturers on special topics. All the prescribed 
courses of instruction, however, were conducted for twenty 
years by Professor Dwight; and he made the school simply 
and solely an avenue to the bar. ‘ Lieber’s audience of 
students seldom rose above four members, and Nairne’s 
was usually one. At last this one disappeared, and Nairne 
refused to try any longer, unless specially ordered by the 
Trustees. The order was never issued and the subject 
of ethics disappeared from the curriculum of the Law 
School.”1 Lieber died in 1872, and the instruction in 
public law fell into abeyance until the appointment of 
Professor Burgess, first as lecturer, in 1875, then as pro- 
fessor in 1876. The first result of the attempt to develop 
university instruction was thus the creation of a profes-

-P-A-G-E-285

sional law school, to which students were admitted without 1858- 
examination. aeie 
As regarded graduate instruction, the experiment of 
1858 was wholly unsuccessful. The graduate schools of 
Letters, Science, and Jurisprudence never really came into 
existence. Accordingly in June, 1861, the Trustees re- 
solved: “That the division of the senior class into three 
schools be abolished at the end of the present academic 
year, and that the course of study thereafter be the same 
for the whole class.” In the same month the select com- 
mittee on the graduate course was discharged at its own 
request. The plan failed, not because of intrinsic defects, 
but because it was put in operation at least two decades 
before the American public was ready for it. 
The attempt to develop university instruction and the 
organization of a successful School of Law undoubtedly in- 
creased the prestige of the institution, and were probably 
of influence in disposing the College of Physicians and Sur- 
geons to seek an alliance with Columbia. The proposition, 
which was presented to the Trustees of Columbia College, 
June 6, 1859, was for a nominal union merely. Each insti- 
tution was to remain independent ; but the College of 
Physicians and Surgeons was to be styled the Medical 
Department of Columbia College, and the two colleges 
were to unite in bestowing, upon the recommendation of 
the Medical Faculty, the degree of doctor of medicine. 
Conference committees were appointed; the report of the 
Columbia committee was favorable; and the alliance was 
consummated a year later, as soon as the College of Physi- 
cians and Surgeons had secured from the legislature of the 
state the necessary modification of its charter. 
A third result of the experiment of 1858 was the estab- 
lishment of still another professional school, the School of 
Mines. At the same meeting of the Trustees at which 
the overtures of the College of Physicians and Surgeons 
were presented, it was resolved: “That the committee on 
 
-P-A-G-E-286
   218 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1858- postgraduate instruction report to this Board at its next 1879 
   meeting on the expediency of establishing a practical school of science.” In the report of the committee of conference, in the same month, it was suggested that « by the establishment of a school of medicine, as now proposed, facilities will be afforded by the eminent abilities of several of the Faculty of the Medical College for forward- ing the establishment of a practical school of science, as now contemplated by the Trustees of Columbia College.” The Trustees were thus prepared to entertain favorably the proposition submitted by Thomas Egleston in March, 1863, to establish a school of mining engineering and metallurgy. The School of Mines was opened November 15, 1864, and its immediate success was beyond anticipation. The con- nection of this school in the minds of the Trustees with the statute of 1857 is made clear by their official utter- ances. The select committee appointed in April, 1863, to report upon the expediency of establishing such a school, recommended “that postgraduate or university professors of analytical chemistry, of mining and metallurgy, and of mineralogy and geology, and instructors in the French and German languages be appointed; such professors and instructors to be compensated wholly by fees.” And in acknowledging a gift of minerals, in September 1864, the Trustees directed that the donor “be informed that ar- rangements are now in progress for establishing, as a por- tion of the postgraduate instruction in the College, a school of mines and metallurgy.” The connection with the resolution of June, 1859, is shown in an official cir- cular of the new school, in which its establishment is described as “a first step” towards “a school of applied science.” 
The prosperous history of these professional schools is narrated elsewhere in this volume. From the point of view of university organization it should be noted that not only was the independent Medical Department a  
-P-A-G-E-287
    THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY 219 
proprietary school, but, owing to the inadequate resources ate 7 of Columbia College, the Schools of Law and of Mines were 
established on practically the same basis, the professors 
receiving no remuneration except from the fees of the 
students. Under such conditions the Columbia authorities 
could have no effective control over the conditions of 
admission or of graduation. The educational standard 
could not equitably be raised without compensating the 
professors for the prospective loss of income. In the case 
of the School of Mines this state of things was happily of 
brief duration. The Law School, however, remained on 
this basis until 1878, and the Medical School until its 
complete union with Columbia University in 1891. 
During the following fifteen years (1865-1879) no new 
educational enterprises were attempted. The energies of 
the corporation were fully occupied in the task of pro- 
viding the College and the School of Mines with suitable 
accommodations and equipment, so far as this was possible 
on the 49th Street site. The School of Law developed in 
Great Jones Street as independently as the College of 
Physicians and Surgeons in 23d Street. 
During this period President Barnard kept constantly 
before the Trustees, the Faculties, and the public the ideal 
of university development. When the condition of the 
College at his installation in 1864 is considered, and 
when it is remembered how recently an ambitious plan 
of university development had failed of accomplishment, 
it is hard to rate too highly the prompt courage with 
which he adopted the university policy or the stubborn 
faith with which he predicted its ultimate triumph. In 
his inaugural address Dr. Barnard said : 
“ Our present beginnings may be the means of drawing 
to us such aid from those to whom the prosperity of this 
College is dear, or who would not willingly see the insti- 
tutions of this magnificent city inferior to those of many 
minor towns, as may enable us to present, as time ad-

  220 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
vances, all the various attractions to seekers after knowl- 
edge which are necessary to complete the full ideal of a 
university.” 
Two years later, in his second annual report (1866), 
he asserted that universities were already growing in 
America by gradual accretion around existing collegiate 
nuclei, and he declared: 
“Tf anything is written in the book of destiny with a 
distinctness not to be mistaken, it is that our own College 
is to furnish a similar example. . . . [Columbia] is the 
nucleus of what will one day be the great university of 
the city — possibly of the continent.” 
In 1879 he wrote: 
“Of the very great number of colleges in our coun- 
try ... few... are likely to become universities, and, 
fortunately, few universities are needed. It would not 
be difficult to point out at the present time a certain 
limited number of these institutions [which] . . . will 
be . . . among those few. Some are indicated by their 
actual present condition, some by their geographical situa- 
tion, and some by these causes combined. Columbia 
College falls into this latter class.” 
And in 1883: 
“America will yet have her universities, offering ad- 
vantages equal to those of the most celebrated similar 
institutions in other lands — universities attractive enough 
not only to deter the graduates of our own colleges from 
seeking their supplementary education elsewhere, but even 
to attract aspirants after knowledge from abroad... . 
Of these Columbia College must manifestly be one. 
Especially favored in point of situation, and possessed 
of an endowment sufficient to guarantee stability and 
to attract additional benefactions . . . its manifest des- 
tiny is to expand in usefulness and strength till it shall 
become the leading educational institution in the United 
States.”
-P-A-G-E-289
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY 221 
Such faith as this was a force; and such prophecies, 1858- 
repeated from time to time with growing assurance, 
contributed in no small measure to their own fulfilment. 
President Barnard, however, did much more than believe 
and prophesy: he zealously aided in the upbuilding of 
every department of instruction already in existence, and 
he indicated from year to year what new branches of in- 
struction Columbia must introduce, what lines of research 
it must prosecute, what alliances with the scientific activi- 
ties of the city and of the country it must form, in order 
to attain the stature and develop the spirit of a university. 
Every step that was taken during his presidency to widen 
the range of Columbia’s work was previously urged by 
him ; nearly every forward movement of the kind that 
has since been initiated, or is now contemplated, will 
be found suggested in one or another of his annual re- 
ports; and in these reports still other developments are 
foreshadowed that can hardly be said to be as yet in 
contemplation. 
During the first fifteen years of Dr. Barnard’s presi- 
dency, however, but one step was taken that demands 
notice in a review of university development. The pro- 
vision of the statute of 1857, that “there shall be fellow- 
ships,” was put in execution in a modest way, in 1871. 
Six fellowships in letters and in science were instituted, 
each of the annual value of $500, to be held for three 
years. Two of these were offered to each class graduat- 
ing from the College. Until 1878 they were awarded 
upon special examinations ; subsequently upon the nomi- 
nation of the College Faculty. Until opportunities were 
developed at Columbia for advanced non-professional 
study, the holders of these fellowships were not only per- 
mitted but expected to study abroad. In 1890, when the 
present system of university fellowships was established, 
these College fellowships were discontinued. From 1872 
to 1890 thirty-three awards were made. The chief re-

   222 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
Lae sult was to assist in providing the future University with properly trained professors ; for while several of the Col- umbia fellows, including Washburn Hopkins, and Richard T. Ely, obtained chairs in other universities, not less than 
thirteen became professors at Columbia, and two of these, 
Professors Butler and Perry, successively guided as Deans 
the development of the Faculty of Philosophy.? 
The only part of the University in which graduate work was prosecuted, even in a modest way, was the School of 
Mines. There, under a system of free tuition to graduates, 
a varying but never large number of students conducted 
investigations with little systematic direction. In 1880- 1881, the year before the scheme of graduate instruction 
presently to be noted was put in force, the number had risen to sixteen; and prior to 1880, sixteen candidates had received the degree of doctor of philosophy on recommen- dation of the Faculty of Mines. 
GrapuaTE ScHooLs AND UNIVERSITY ORGANIZATION 
(1880-1904) 
In 1878 we find the Trustees again occupied, if not with 
the development of graduate instruction, at-least with the 
matter of graduate study. A resolution of May 6, 1878, declared : 
“That after the annual commencement of June, 1880, the degree of master of arts in course shall not be con- ferred except upon bachelors of arts of this College of three years’ standing or more, who shall have passed an approved examination upon studies to be prescribed by the Faculty... .” 
The Faculty was more conservative than the Trustees. Resolutions adopted by it March 14, and approved by the Trustees, April 7, 1879, announced that the degree of

master of arts would be conferred not only upon those 1890- 1904 
graduates who successfully pursued a prescribed course 
of study, but also upon those who presented, in lieu of 
examination, a thesis or dissertation, or a degree conferred 
in course by a regularly incorporated school of theology, 
law, medicine, or science. 
In 1879, in his annual report, President Barnard strongly 
urged that a new attempt should be made to provide 
graduate instruction. He declared that the need of such 
instruction was fully recognized, instancing the numbers 
of American college graduates studying in Europe, and 
the development of graduate courses at a few American 
colleges. He hazarded the prophecy that, in those Ameri- 
can institutions which should make satisfactory provision 
for such advanced studies, the graduate instruction might, 
in time, “overshadow the undergraduate.” “ Our uni- 
versities,” he added, “ will be formed by the expansion of 
the system of postgraduate instruction.” On February 
25, 1880, he presented to the Trustees’ committee on the 
course a memorial on graduate instruction, and a plan for 
its immediate establishment in certain branches. 
A few days earlier, on February 20, Professor John W. 
Burgess had submitted to the President a plan for the 
establishment of a university “department” of political 
science, with a course of instruction in history, public law, 
Roman and modern civil law; and political economy. 
This department was to be open to students who should 
have successfully completed the junior year of a college 
course, or who should pass equivalent examinations, includ- 
ing, in either case, a fair reading knowledge of the French 
and German languages. The fee for instruction was to 
be the same as in the undergraduate department of the 
College, and the studies of the first year were to be open 
to members of the senior class. All the courses were to 
be open to students in the School of Law without additional 
fees. On the successful completion of the first year, stu- 
  
-P-A-G-E-292
   224 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1880- dents were to receive the degree of bachelor of arts; on 
   completion of all the courses, and after successful examina- 
tion therein, students were to receive the degrees of master 
of arts and doctor of philosophy ; “and if in addition to the 
courses in this department the student shall have received 
the degree of bachelor of laws, either from the Law School 
of this University or from any other school of municipal 
law in good standing, the degree shall be that of doctor 
of civil law.” The reasons assigned for establishing this 
department were to provide adequate training for the civil 
service of the government, and to develop all branches 
of the political sciences. “It is the bounden duty of a 
university, worthy the name, to teach all that has been 
gathered in the world’s experience in this as well as in all 
other departments of superior knowledge, and to add con- 
tinually thereto.” 
The antecedent history of this proposal was as follows. 
In 1875 Professor Burgess, then occupying the chair of 
history and political science at Amherst College, was 
invited to deliver a course of lectures upon public law at 
the Columbia Law School. In the following year he was 
called to Columbia as professor of history, political science, 
and international law, with a seat in the Faculty of the 
College as well as in the Law Faculty. In 1877 Rich- 
mond Mayo-Smith, who had studied at Amherst under 
Professor Burgess and subsequently for two years in 
Germany, was appointed tutor in history in the College; 
in 1878 he became adjunct professor of political economy 
and social science. In the College Professors Burgess 
and Mayo-Smith had free hand in organizing general his- 
torical instruction and elementary teaching in political 
economy. In the Law School Professor Burgess found it 
impossible to develop the department of public law or to 
introduce the study of foreign law and comparative juris- 
prudence. “In the year 1875,” as Professor Burgess has 
since stated, “the Trustees resolved to... attempt to

    THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY 225: 
reintroduce [into the Law School] those branches of 1880- 
jurisprudence lost... . by the death of Lieber and the 14 
withdrawal of Nairne. They resolved that the period of 
study in the Law School should be extended from two to 
three years, with the purpose that courses in political his- 
tory, public law, and political science should form parts of 
the curriculum required for the attainment of the degree.” 1 
This change, however, was successfully opposed by Pro- 
fessor Dwight. In 1879 Professor Burgess was con- 
vinced that he had failed to realize the purpose for which 
he had been called to Columbia, namely “to neutralize 
the intense professionalism of the Law School by sup- 
plementing the studies in private law . . . with those 
studies in ethics, history, and public law necessary to com- 
plete the science of jurisprudence.” 
“T frankly told the Trustees my conviction. ... I told 
them, however, that I was still unwilling to have any com- 
pulsion exercised . . . in regard to a reform of the law 
curriculum, and that I thought there was another way out 
of the difficulty... } I then laid before them the plan 
for the creation of a faculty of political science, which 
should teach all the branches of history, sociology, eco- 
nomics, public law, and comparative jurisprudence, and 
should be empowered to induce the law students to pursue 
these studies by the offer of [higher] degrees. ... The 
purpose for which the School of Political Science was 
created [was] the education of the rulers of the country 
—for the lawyers are the rulers of the country — in those 
subjects which will properly prepare them for their high- 
est work.”? 
President Barnard accepted the plan with much warmth, 
incorporating it with his own in his communication of 
February 25 to the committee on the course. He insisted 
particularly upon the consideration that such a course of 
study as Professor Burgess proposed would serve to pre-

cited above. 2 Ibid.

  226 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
pare young men for governmental service. It should be 
remembered that at this time the movement for the reform 
of the federal civil service was achieving its first triumphs, 
and that the supporters of the competitive system looked 
forward to its rapid extension to all but the highest posi- 
tions in the domestic and foreign service of the country. 
Professor Burgess himself said, in his letter to the Presi- 
dent, that “the government. . . in its civil service re- 
forms . . . has opened the way for an honorable career to 
the young men of the nation in the governmental service, 
which may be successfully pursued by the best intelli- 
gence, skill, and fidelity, offering itself without any ref- 
erence to political influence or patronage.” President 
Barnard further suggested that the proposed course of 
study would serve to fit young men “for the duties and 
responsibilities of public journalists” ; and he proposed 
the establishment of a “school of preparation for the civil 
services, diplomacy, and the editorial profession.” This 
was the first suggestion of a new “school,” and it is the 
more surprising as it came in connection with the move- 
ment to establish a general system of graduate instruction. 
The explanation is that the graduate instruction proposed 
by the President was to be non-professional, while the 
course of study proposed by Professor Burgess seemed to 
the President to be professional. Possibly also the Presi- 
dent judged that a graduate “school” would enjoy greater 
prestige, and would be more likely to attract graduates of 
other colleges, both from the Law School and from outside 
the University, than a mere “department ” of the College ; 
and if so, he judged rightly. 
Besides proposing the establishment of a “school” 
instead of a “department,” President Barnard suggested 
that the degree to be given at the end of the first year 
should be bachelor of philosophy, instead of bachelor of 
arts; and he did not support Professor Burgess’s pro- 
posal that the degree of D.C.L. be given in course.  
-P-A-G-E-297
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY 227 
Further changes were made by the Trustees’ committee te 
on course, which consisted of the Rev. Morgan Dix, 
Dr. Cornelius R. Agnew, Stephen P. Nash, Gouverneur 
M. Ogden, and the President. This committee made its 
report May 8, 1880. Taking up first the President’s plan 
of graduate instruction, it declared : 
“The question of the desirability or importance of 
affording to young men opportunities for more advanced 
study than the necessarily narrow limits of the under- 
graduate course allow is one which... it is hardly 
necessary to argue... . With the Trustees of Colum- 
bia College the question has not been whether we should 
take part in the movement, but whether the time had 
arrived when we could do so with effect.” 
As regarded the proposed “school of preparation for 
the civil service,” the committee said that it was hardly 
necessary to make training for the service of the govern- 
ment “a declared object, and to do so might awaken 
jealousies prejudicial to success.” 
“That the proposed system of training would in fact 
form an admirable preparation for the duties of office, 
or for the discharge of any public function, whether 
executive or legislative, can hardly be doubted; . . . but 
it is not to be assumed that as political affairs are now 
managed, the possession of superior qualifications will 
necessarily afford the aspirant to place any very sub- 
stantial preliminary advantage.” 
The committee reported a plan of graduate instruction 
in ancient and modern languages and literatures, in mathe- 
matics, astronomy, physics, and chemistry, and in history 
and political economy; in all fifteen courses, occupying 
respectively from one to three hours per week. These 
courses were to be delivered in the main by members of 
the teaching force as previously constituted, no additional 
appointments being recommended except of three tutors 
and an instructor. Six other courses were to be offered,
-P-A-G-E-298
  
228 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1980- “as soon as satisfactory arrangements can be made for the 
1904 purpose.” 
The committee also reported a statute establishing a 
School of Political Science, “designed to prepare young 
men for the duties of public life.” The school was to 
be conducted by Professors Burgess and Mayo-Smith 
with the assistance of two new lecturers. The conditions 
of admission and the course of study were those which 
Professor Burgess had proposed; the degrees to be 
awarded were those proposed by President Barnard, viz., 
Ph.B. and Ph.D. A point in which the committee 
departed from the plan proposed by Professor Burgess 
and endorsed by the President touched the relation of the 
new course of study to the undergraduate curriculum. 
Professor Burgess had proposed that the first year lectures 
in political science should be thrown open to seniors in the 
College. President Barnard had proposed a more liberal 
elective system in the College, which, if accepted, would 
have made Professor Burgess’s plan feasible. The com- 
mittee was unwilling to allow to undergraduates a larger 
liberty in the selection of their studies. Thus the new 
school, instead of footing in the College, as Professor Bur- 
gess—following in this point the plan of 1857—had 
proposed, was organized wholly outside of the College, 
with what was practically a competing senior year, handi- 
capped by an inferior degree. 
The Trustees who were especially interested in the 
establishment of the School of Political Science, and to 
whose exertions its establishment was chiefly due, were 
Justice Blatchford, Hon. Hamilton Fish, Stephen P. Nash, 
and Samuel B. Ruggles. Two of these, Messrs. Fish and 
Ruggles, had participated actively in the university move- 
ment of 1857-1858. To Mr. Ruggles, the establishment 
of the School of Political Science was a renewal of that 
movement ; and when, on June 7, 1880, the report of the 
committee on course was adopted by the Board of Trustees,
-P-A-G-E-299
    THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY 229 
he cabled to Professor Burgess, then in Paris: “Thank 1S 
God, the University is born.” 
In comparing the movement of 1857-1858 with that 
which began in 1880 and which has given to the Uni- 
versity three flourishing non-professional schools, it is to 
be noted that the university instruction of 1858 was to 
be conducted by lecturers dependent wholly or largely on 
fees, and that these fees were to be obtained by opening the 
university lectures to the public. The university courses 
instituted in 1880 were conducted by salaried instructors 
and were intended for college-bred men only. On this 
narrower but more solid ground the Columbia graduate 
schools have grown slowly but steadily to their present 
strength. 
The history of the School of Political Science is told in 
the following chapter ; the history of the graduate instruc- 
tion in other branches from 1880 to 1890 must be out- 
lined here in order to make clear the conditions that 
preceded the establishment of the Schools of Philosophy 
and of Pure Science. The only degree at first offered 
to graduate students in the College proper was that of 
master of arts. Under the Trustees’ resolution of May 6, 
1878, and the Faculty’s resolution of March 14, 1879, this 
degree could be attained either by non-resident or by 
resident students, but in no case was it to be awarded 
until three years after the attainment of the first degree. 
The Faculty arranged five (later, six) groups of subjects 
upon which candidates were to be examined, and pre- 
scribed for the non-resident students a course of reading 
in each subject. Resident study was at first regarded 
simply as an alternative method by which a candidate 
could prepare himself for examination. June 10, 1882, 
the Trustees enacted that the degree of master of arts 
might be conferred after one year’s study in the graduate 
department ; December 4, 1882, that the doctor’s degree 
in philosophy, science, or letters might be conferred after  
-P-A-G-E-300
  230 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
Bee two years’ study ; December 3, 1883, that but one doctor’s 
degree should be conferred, that of doctor of philosophy. 
The system of non-residential study and examination 
on prescribed reading attracted very few candidates, nor 
was it long maintained. The graduate instruction that 
was offered in 1880 and actually organized in 1881 drew 
to the College (or rather, held in the College, for the 
number drawn from outside was very small) a gradually 
increasing body of resident students. From 1881 to 1885 
the average number was twelve ; from 1885 to 1890 it was 
twenty-nine. The average number of graduate students 
in the School of Mines (where tuition of graduates had 
now ceased to be gratuitous) was far smaller. 
In the meantime what was practically a new school 
had been established in connection with the School of 
Mines. A department of architecture was organized in 
1881 and placed under the direction of Professor William 
R. Ware. In its development the engineering side of 
architecture was so increasingly subordinated to the artis- 
tic that the separation of this school from the Schools of 
Applied Science, which occurred in 1902, was only a 
formal recognition of a long-accomplished fact. 
In 1886 there was opened, at Columbia, a school for 
training librarians. It was described as a “School of 
Library Economy,” and was under the direction of Libra- 
rian Melvil Dewey. This was the first department of 
Columbia to which women were admitted as resident stu- 
dents. The school was transferred to Albany in 1889, 
when Mr. Dewey resigned his position at Columbia to 
become State Librarian. 
The further development of the University, and particu- 
larly the further development of non-professional graduate 
instruction, were closely connected with a new movement, 
that of university organization. To President Barnard 
expansion was of supreme interest; problems of organiza- 
tion had for him little attraction. In his report of 1883  
-P-A-G-E-301
    THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY 231 
he indeed proposed a more logical organization of facul- ee 
ties; but in his scheme he made no clear distinction 
between college and university instruction, nor between 
professional and research training ; and the only sugges- 
tion of his which was afterwards accepted was that the 
Faculty of the School of Mines should be known as the 
Faculty of Applied Science. The chief impulse to the new 
movement came from Professor Burgess, and the organi- 
zation which was developed early in President Low’s 
administration was largely based on Professor Burgess’s 
suggestions. The chief points of his programme were: 
maintenance of the disciplinary or gymnasial character 
of the College to the close of the junior year; the short- 
ening of the College course, not by abandoning any portion 
of it, but by treating the senior year as a University year; 
provision for advanced instruction and for research in non- 
professional university faculties, codrdinated and closely 
associated with the professional faculties; and the direc- 
tion of the educational policy of the University by an 
academic senate composed of representatives of the dif- 
ferent university faculties. 
That the Trustees were seriously considering the prob- 
lem of university organization became evident in 1887. 
In his report of that year, President Barnard noted that 
there was pending before the standing committee on the 
course of instruction “a resolution which suggests the 
immediate adoption of energetic measures to lift the whole 
plane of instruction here to the level of the university 
standard. The resolution even suggests, inferentially at 
least, the expediency of abandoning the undergraduate 
School of Arts entirely, and devoting the whole strength 
of the institution to its superior work.” Discussing this 
proposal, Dr. Barnard pointed out that the discontinuance 
of the undergraduate college course was neither necessary 
nor desirable. Its maintenance would not in any manner 
1 Burgess, ‘‘The American University,’’ Boston, 1884.
-P-A-G-E-302
  232 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1880- interfere with the university system; its abandonment 1904     
    
would cut off a valuable source of supply.1_ The whole 
subject was laid before the teaching body by the follow- 
ing circular letter, sent to each Faculty, except that of 
Medicine : 
“The Trustees have appointed a committee to consider and 
report as to the feasibility and expediency of so modifying, 
extending, and elevating the course of instruction that the 
entire system of education offered in the college and its schools 
shall be placed upon a higher plane, and that the instruction 
hereafter to be given shall be confined to what are known as 
‘postgraduate studies.’ 
“The Committee is also directed to consider and report upon 
the expediency of retaining and removing the School of Arts 
to buildings within or without the city limits. 
“The undersigned, in behalf of the Committee, request the 
views and opinions of your Faculty, and of its individual mem- 
bers in the premises. 
“ Wm. C. ScoeRMERHORN, Chairman. 
“ Cuas. M. Da Costa, Secretary. 
“‘CoLtumBia Cotiece, April 10, 1888.” 
In May and June replies were submitted by the Facul- 
ties of Law, of Political Science, and of Mines. In Novem- 
ber a reply from the College Faculty was adopted by a 
two-thirds vote, and a separate reply was submitted by 
the minority. In the debates of the various Faculties 
President Barnard took no part, by reason of ill health. 
The College was under the guidance of Professor Drisler, 
as acting President. 
All the replies recommended the maintenance of the 
undergraduate College and its continued local connection 
with the University. The Faculty of the School of Mines 
recommended elective groups in the junior year of the

    THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY 233 
College and unrestricted election in the senior year. The 
Faculties of Law and of Political Science and the minority 
of the College Faculty recommended a sharp distinction 
between the first three years of the College course and 
the fourth. The three-year course was to be substantially 
a course of prescribed studies, conducted by a separate 
body of instructors; the fourth year was to be treated as 
a university year, and the seniors were to have the liberty 
of studying under any university faculty. No bachelor’s 
degree was to be conferred until the completion of this first 
university year. The Faculty of Political Science recom- 
mended the establishment of a preparatory school with a 
four-year curriculum, to be conducted by the instructors 
engaged in the work of undergraduate instruction. 
The College Faculty desired to retain control of the 
graduate courses, and recommended “the relief of the 
professors that have charge of such courses from a pro- 
portionate amount of work in the undergraduate classes.” 
The Faculty of the School of Mines desired to control 
the higher instruction of its graduates. The Faculties of 
Law and of Political Science recommended that the conduct 
of higher instruction in the natural sciences be intrusted 
to the Faculty of Mines; but for the conduct of the 
advanced courses in philosophy, letters, and philology 
these Faculties and the minority of the College Faculty 
recommended the establishment of a university faculty 
of philosophy. The Faculty of Political Science and 
the minority of the College Faculty recommended that 
this new faculty should be composed of the instructors 
who were already engaged in senior and graduate work 
in the subjects assigned to its jurisdiction. 
For the encouragement of university study, all the 
Faculties concurred in recommending a liberal system of 
fellowships. The School of Mines Faculty suggested sixty 
such fellowships of $500 each, and urged that the tuition 
of graduates should be free.   
-P-A-G-E-304
   1880- 
190: 4 234 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
The Faculties of Law and of Political Science and the 
minority of the College Faculty further recommended 
the establishment of a university senate, which should be 
composed of the President and of two or three representa- 
tives from each of the university faculties (Law, Political 
Selene Natural Science, and Philosophy). This senate 
was to have, subject to the control of the Trustees, the 
general direction of the educational policy of the Univer- 
sity, at least in all matters of common concern, including 
the undergraduate curriculum. 
It should be noted that at that time, as now, many pro- 
fessors sat in more than one Faculty. In the four Facul- 
ties (College, Law, Mines, Political Science) there were, 
in all, thirty-two professors. The so-called “university 
party,” which presented the plan for the establishment of 
a faculty of philosophy and for the constitution of a uni- 
versity senate, was a minority party, numbering eleven.

elevation of the course appointed a committee, consisting 
of Acting President Drisler, Professor Thomas Randolph 
Price, and Adjunct Professor Nicholas Murray Butler, “to 
prepare and submit a plan for a university faculty of phi- 
losophy (i.e. of letters, philology, and philosophy).” Pro- 
fessor Butler was at that time the junior member of the 
professorial body, as Professor Drisler was the senior. On 
October 28, the majority of this committee presented a 
report suggesting a wider faculty of philosophy, which 
should include mathematics and the natural sciences, his- 
tory, political philosophy, and sociology ; proposing that 
courses under this faculty should be open only to students 
holding the first degree, who should previously, in their last 
college year, have pursued elective courses in the depart- 
ments in which they desired to prosecute their university 
studies ; and recommending that the degree of master of 
arts should be conferred upon graduate students after one 
year and the degree of doctor of philosophy after three years.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY 235 
From these recommendations Professor Butler dissented in 1880- 
a minority report. He objected to the wider faculty pro- ee 
posed by the majority, asserting that the tendency of 
modern university organization was to subdivide the old 
faculty of philosophy into three faculties, viz.: political 
science, mathematics and natural science, and philosophy. 
He favored, accordingly, the recognition of these three 
faculties, with that of law, as university faculties, and he pro- 
posed a single university matriculation, which would en- 
title the student to pursue his studies in any single faculty, 
or, with the approval of the proposed university senate, in 
two or more faculties. He objected also to the postpone- 
ment of the doctor’s degree until three years after the 
attainment of the baccalaureate degree, advocating a three- 
year course beginning in the senior year of the College. 
He also expressed the opinion that the regulations for 
the higher degrees should be considered and adopted 
by a university senate before their presentation to the 
Trustees. 
When these reports were presented, the Hon. Seth 
Low had just been chosen President, to succeed President 
Barnard. Shortly after his installation President Low 
addressed a general invitation to the professors to express 
to him their views upon the subject of reorganization. 
This elicited a new plan, proposed February 21, 1890, by 
Professor Van Amringe and some other members of the 
College and School of Mines Faculties. This plan differed 
from Professor Burgess’s chiefly in proposing the abolition 
of the existing Faculty of Political Science (the professors 
of public law and jurisprudence in this Faculty were to be 
associated with the professors of private law in a faculty of 
jurisprudence, and the professors of economics were to be 
assigned to the College Faculty), and in providing that in 
the university faculties only heads of departments should 
have seat and voice. It was suggested, further, that if 
satisfactory arrangements could be made with the institu- 
 
-P-A-G-E-306
     236 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1880- tions concerned, two additional university faculties should 
   be established, viz.: a faculty of medicine, consisting of 
the heads of departments in the College of Physicians and 
Surgeons, and a faculty of theology, composed of the heads 
of departments in the General and Union Theological 
Seminaries. Each of the university faculties was to elect 
two (or three) representatives who, with the President, 
should constitute a university council. This council should 
control the non-professional university degrees and should 
be entitled to consider and report upon all educational 
matters “ except the conferring of the first degree.” 
These proposals showed clearly how much progress the 
university idea had made in two years. The university 
faculty of philosophy and the central senate or council, 
proposed in 1888 by a minority, were now generally 
accepted, and the differences of opinion now regarded the 
organization of these bodies and the extent of jurisdiction 
to be exercised by the proposed council. 
On February 27, 1890, President Low sent to each pro- 
fessor a pamphlet containing the various plans proposed by 
the different Faculties and by individual members thereof, 
together with a series of questions formulating the points 
of difference. At the head of the list he put the question, 
suggested by Professor Butler but hitherto not debated, 
whether a single matriculation fee should admit to all 
departments of the College and University. He invited 
all the members of the various Faculties to meet in the 
office of the President, March 12, at eight o’clock, to 
debate the questions proposed, adding: “In case the dis- 
cussion cannot be concluded in a single evening, I shall 
be prepared to adjourn it to . . . March 14 and 15.” 
For the first time since the establishment of the pro- 
fessional schools the great council or full academic senate, 
composed of all the members of all the Faculties (except 
that of Medicine), was thus convened. It has not since 
been assembled. At the time it consisted of only thirty-  
-P-A-G-E-307
  THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY 237 
four professors. To-day (1904) the Faculty of Pure 
Science has thirty-four members, the Faculty of Philoso- 
phy thirty-six, and the entire professorial body numbers 
one hundred and thirty-four. Of the thirty-four who 
were summoned to meet on those March evenings, in the 
old President’s House on 49th Street, but thirteen were 
still in the active service of the University in 1904. 
All the three evenings assigned were fully occupied. 
On each question each professor had opportunity to speak, 
the youngest member of the assembly first, as in a council 
of war. No vote was taken on any question. The Presi- 
dent had expressly stated, in calling this assembly to- 
gether, that the purpose of the discussion was to enable 
him to acquaint himself thoroughly with the entire range 
of opinion throughout the College on these far-reaching 
questions. 
The plan formulated by President Low and accepted by 
the Trustees in May, 1890, was in some respects a compro- 
mise. A Faculty of Philosophy was established, composed 
of the professors and adjunct professors giving instruction 
in philosophy, letters, and philology, and this Faculty was 
intrusted with the direction of university study in these 
departments. The qualification for admission, as in the 
School of Political Science, was the completion of the junior 
year ina college. A University Council was constituted, 
in which the Faculties of Law, of Mines, of Political 
Science, and of Philosophy were represented, each by its 
Dean and by an elected delegate, and in which the School 
of Arts (College) was also’ represented, ex officiis, by its 
Dean and Secretary. Except when an appointed Dean or 
Warden was already in office (which was the case in the 
Schools of Mines and of Law), the Faculties were to elect 
Deans. The President was to nominate two members 
of the Council “with especial reference to securing a 
rounded representation of subjects.” 
The University Council at the outset was an advisory 
  1880- 
1904
-P-A-G-E-308
  238 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1880- body, without definite powers. It was practically a Pres- 
ident’s council. It was in particular to “advise the 
President as to all matters affecting the master’s and 
doctor’s degrees, the correlation of courses, the extension 
of university work in new and old fields, and generally as 
to such matters as the President may bring before it.” 
Two years later, June 6, 1892, the Trustees gave to the 
Council definite administrative and legislative powers. 
As regarded the non-professional Faculties it obtained the 
position of an upper house. As regarded the other Facul- 
ties it received no legislative powers, but it was clothed 
with the right and charged with the duty of making recom- 
mendations, not only to the several Faculties but to the 
Trustees, concerning the educational administration of the 
University. At the same time the power of nominating 
members was withdrawn from the President, and the 
Council became purely representative. 
At the close of the same month in which the reorgani- 
zation of the University was accomplished (May 31, 1890), 
the Faculty of Arts (College) unanimously resolved that 
courses designated by the Faculties of Philosophy, Law, 
Mines, or Political Science as open to students who had 
completed the junior year in the School of Arts or in any 
other college maintaining an equivalent curriculum, should 
be recognized as elective studies in the senior year. This 
resolution was referred by the Trustees to the President 
and Council with power; and receiving the unanimous 
approval of the Council, it was put in force in the follow- 
ing autumn. When the College of Physicians and Sur- 
geons became an integral part of the University, a similar 
resolution was adopted concerning courses recommended 
by the Faculty of Medicine. The senior year of the 
College thus became in effect a university year. The 
result, as President Low remarked in his report of 1892, 
was not only to enrich the curriculum of the College, but 
to make it possible for those men who take both the A.B.  
-P-A-G-E-309
  
  THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY 239 
degree and the professional degree to shorten their period 1880- 
of college and university study by one year. “In recent 14 
years,” he continued, “all professional courses have been 
lengthened. ... The tendency of lengthening the pro- 
fessional course . . . is to lead men to omit the college 
course altogether. It is believed that the system intro- 
duced at Columbia will do much to offset this unfortunate 
tendency.” In 1894 he reported: “ As a whole, the plan 
has proved an unqualified success... . <A very signifi- 
cant illustration of the effect of the system is seen in the 
increasing number of Columbia graduates who remain in 
the University after receiving the first degree.” In 1895, 
in discussing the possibility of raising the standard of 
admission to all the professional schools “until a liberal 
training equivalent to the old-time college course is 
demanded as a condition for admission to every one of 
them,” he pointed out that the most serious obstacle to 
such a policy was the length of the combined college and 
professional courses. If these were not shortened, “ only 
one result can follow: the colleges will be syphoned of 
their intending professional students, and such students 
will go direct from the high schools to the schools of law 
and medicine.” He recommended accordingly that certain 
pre-professional studies be made elective in the junior year. 
In 1896 a further step was taken. The College adopted 
a new curriculum, which went into effect July 1, 1897, 
and which made it possible for students intending to 
enter any one of the Columbia Schools of Applied Science 
to anticipate two years of professional work, and to secure 
both the college degree and the professional degree in six 
years. 
This “Columbia plan,” as it has come to be known 
in educational discussion, has been adopted by several 
American universities, and a large number of independent 
colleges have introduced semi-professional or professional 
studies in the later years of the baccalaureate course.
-P-A-G-E-310
  240 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1880- Objection to the plan has been raised on two grounds, 
1 viz.: that it is not open and above-board, in that it classes 
among college students those who have really become 
professional students, and that it is pedagogically unsatis- 
factory, in that it divides the students’ interests and alle- 
giance between the college and the professional school. 
In the years 1902-1904, in consequence of President But- 
ler’s suggestion that all professional study at Columbia 
should be based on a two-year college course, and that a 
first degree or certificate might be given to all students 
who should satisfactorily complete such a course, the 
existing system was resubjected to full discussion ; and 
the University Council, at a special meeting held March 5, 
1904, recommended by a four-fifths majority that the 
shortened courses for the collegiate and professional de- 
grees should not only be retained but should be further 
developed. The Council plan would involve the award 
of the first degree on any of the following combinations, 
viz.: a three-year college course and one year of study 
under the Faculties of Political Science, Philosophy, or 
Pure Science ; a three-year college course and one year 
of legal study ; a two-year college course and two years 
of study under any of the other professional Faculties. 
The Council further recommended that students pursu- 
ing courses offered by a professional Faculty, not as a 
part of their general education but with a professional 
aim, should be primarily registered in the professional 
school and placed under the jurisdiction of its Faculty ; 
and that unless they should be so registered, the courses 
pursued by them should not count toward the professional 
degree. 
Until 1898 students who had completed the junior year 
at other colleges maintaining an equivalent curriculum, and 
who then became seniors at Columbia, enjoyed the privi- 
lege of electing a full year of professional study. Since 
that time, in consequence of a resolution adopted by the

THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY 241 
Faculty of the College, this privilege has been granted 1880- 
only to students who enter Columbia not later than the 1° 
beginning of the junior year. 
The year of reorganization (1890) was followed by 
years of active internal development and of further expan- 
sion. In 1891 the Trustees granted to each professor in 
the University the privilege of taking, on half-pay, a year’s 
leave of absence once in every seven years, with the 
limitation, however, that such leave of absence should not 
be granted to more than four professors in any academic 
year. In 1903 the number who might enjoy the so-called 
“sabbatical year” was increased to six. At the same 
time (1891) a pension system was established, under 
which any professor who has been in the service of the 
University for fifteen years and has reached the age of 
sixty-five is entitled, on his own ce to be retired 
from active duty on half-pay. 
In the same year two measures were re to make 
graduate non-professional instruction available to larger 
numbers of students. Twenty-four university fellowships 
were established, of the value of $650 each ($500 and 
free tuition), twelve to be awarded for the year 1891-1892, 
eighteen for the year 1892-1893, and twenty-four for each 
year thereafter. The award was intrusted to the Univer- 
sity Council. In ela the increase in the number 
of special fellowships endowed by private benefactions, 
these university fellowships were subsequently reduced in 
number to eighteen. Unlike the fellowships bestowed 
between 1871 and 1891, these were open, from the outset, 
to graduates of any college or university ; and their value 
in attracting to Columbia from all parts of the United 
States, and also from Canada, students of special ability 
who intend to become teachers has been very great. It 
was only after the establishment of these fellowships that 
graduates of the School of Political Science began to be 
appointed in considerable numbers to teaching positions 
R

  242 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
in leading American colleges and universities. The fact 
that such appointments were being made attracted other 
graduate students of the same class; and when instruc- 
tors trained at Columbia began to send their students to 
Columbia for graduate work, the “primary registration ” 
in the School of Political Science grew far more rapidly 
than in the earlier pre-fellowship period. Through this 
wise liberality of the Trustees, the Schools of Philosophy 
and of Pure Science enjoyed from their establishment the 
encouragement which the School of Political Science had 
lacked in the first decade of its existence. 
In 1891, also, the Trustees initiated a system of 
alliances with neighboring theological seminaries which 
has not merely made Columbia’s graduate instruction 
available to students in these seminaries, but has practically 
given to Columbia University the fourth of the traditional 
faculties — theology —and in a fashion singularly fore- 
shadowed by the supplementary charter of 1755 and the 
resolutions of the Regents in 1784. Columbia’s “ Faculty 
of Divinity ” is now in fact composed, as was suggested by 
the Regents, of “such professorships as may be established 
by the different religious societies within the state.” In 
1891 the General Theological Seminary of the Protestant 
Episcopal church and the Union Theological Seminary 
of the Presbyterian church were invited to enter into 
relations of educational alliance with Columbia. The 
Union Theological Seminary accepted the proposal at 
once. By an agreement dated June 8, 1891, the educa- 
tional facilities of each institution were made available, 
under suitable conditions, to students of the other, with- 
out payment of any additional tuition fee; certain sub- 
jects taught at the Seminary were recognized as minor 
subjects for the master’s and doctor’s degrees at Columbia ; 
and the President of the Seminary obtained seat and 
advisory voice in the University Council. More tardily, 
October 22, 1908, the General Theological Seminary 
 
-P-A-G-E-315
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY 243 
entered into a like agreement and its Dean received the 1880- 
same privileges. Similar relations of reciprocity, without a 
representation, were established in 1892 with the Jewish 
Theological Seminary of New York City ; in 1899 with 
the Drew Seminary of the Methodist Episcopal church at 
Madison, New Jersey ; and in 1902 with St. Joseph’s 
Theological Seminary of the Roman Catholic church at 
Yonkers, New York. 
In the same year (1891) the College of Physicians and 
Surgeons became an integral part of Columbia University. 
It is worthy of note that as the alliance of 1860 followed 
the tentative university developments of 1858, so the 
real union of 1891 followed the reorganization and expan- 
sion of 1890. By a provisional agreement between the 
Trustees of the two institutions, signed February 4, 1891, 
the College of Physicians and Surgeons surrendered to 
Columbia College all its property, and Columbia accepted 
the property subject to the trust with which it was 
charged, viz., the maintenance of medical education. The 
College of Physicians and Surgeons became subject to the 
administrative and educational control of the Columbia 
corporation with the following limitations, viz.: that its 
Faculty should “have the right in perpetuity of nomina- 
tion to the corps of instruction in the medical department, 
and the right to refuse instruction to women.” By an 
act of the New York legislature, approved March 24, 1891, 
the Trustees of the College of Physicians and Surgeons 
were empowered to transfer their property and to sur- 
render their separate charter; and by an agreement of 
June 5, 1891, the provisional agreement of February 4 was 
approved and confirmed. Like the other University 
Faculties, the Faculty of Medicine sends its Dean and an 
additional delegate to the University Council. In 1893 
the medical course was lengthened to four years, the new 
rule being first applied to the students entering in 1894. 
In 1898 the University Council recommended that the 
 
-P-A-G-E-316
244 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
Ae College of Physicians and Surgeons should be made a 
graduate school as soon as such a change should be 
financially practicable. In 1901, by a resolution of the 
Faculty of Medicine, approved by the Trustees, a pre- 
liminary step was taken toward this goal: it was pro- 
vided that after July 1, 1903, the requirements for 
admission to the School of Medicine should be the same 
as for admission to Columbia College. They have in fact 
been made more rigorous, in that a larger proportion of 
the preliminary studies are definitely prescribed. 
In 1891 the School of Law was reorganized. In 1878 
this school came under the effective control of the corpo- 
ration, and an examination for admission was required of 
students not graduates of any college. In 1878 and 1879 
two new professors were appointed, in order to relieve the 
Warden, who had thus far conducted the entire instruction 
in private law, of a portion of his responsibilities, and in 
order to insure that the school should not be suspended 
or even temporarily disorganized by the death of its 
founder. In 1888 a three-year course went into effect, as 
regarded the students entering in that year. The first 
third year class, that of 1890-1891, was largely instructed 
by members of the Faculty of Political Science. In 1891 
it was decided by the Trustees that a new curriculum 
should be established, requiring a larger number of hours 
of attendance, and making it impracticable for students of 
the first two years to combine, as had been their practice, 
study at the school with training in law offices. The 
courses offered by the Faculty of Political Science in 
constitutional, administrative, and international law were 
made elective for the law degree. Before this new curric- 
ulum was adopted, Professor Dwight asked to be retired ; 
and upon its adoption, two other professors resigned their 
chairs and opened an independent proprietary school of 
law, in which the “ Dwight method ” of instruction was to 
be perpetuated. They carried with them to a large extent 
 
-P-A-G-E-317
  THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY 245 
what may not inappropriately be described as the good- 1880- 
will of the business, and the attendance in the Columbia /®* 
School of Law was very greatly reduced. The Faculty was 
promptly reconstituted; and under the guidance of Dean 
William A. Keener, appointed professor of law in 1890, 
the school steadily increased in membership until 1903, 
when the requirement of a college degree or an equivalent 
education as a condition for admission, announced four 
years previously, went into operation. 
In 1893 the degree of master of laws was established, 
to be awarded on recommendation of the Law Faculty to 
students completing a fourth year of legal study. In the 
following year the degree was made a university degree, to 
be awarded on recommendation of the University Council 
to students who, after completing the junior year of a col- 
lege course, should pursue the studies of law and of politi- 
cal science for four years. Few of these degrees have been 
awarded, because the majority of the law students who 
have specialized in public law and comparative jurispru- 
dence have preferred to become candidates for the doctor’s 
degree in the Faculty of Political Science. 
In 1892 a third non-professional faculty was established, 
that of Pure Science. It was charged with the higher 
instruction and with research training in the field of 
mathematics and of the natural sciences. In the reorgan- 
ization of 1890, these duties had been assigned to the 
Faculty of the School of Mines. If a Faculty of Pure 
Science had been then established, it would have been 
merely a large committee of the Mines Faculty. In the 
intervening period of two years the situation had changed. 
With the assistance of a bequest of $100,000 from their 
late colleague Charles M. Da Costa, the Trustees organ- 
ized, in 1891, a strong department of biology, —a depart- 
ment which had no natural place in the Schools of Applied 
Science. The first Da Costa professor, Henry Fairfield 
Osborn, was curator of mammalian paleontology in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-318
246 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1is80- American Museum of Natural History; and by an agree- 
1904 ment made in the following year the Museum placed its 
collections at the service of the instructors and advanced 
students of Columbia. In 1891 the New York Botanical 
Garden was organized and placed under the supervision 
of a board which included the President of Columbia and 
the Columbia professors of botany, chemistry, and geology, 
and it was evident that within a few years the opportu- 
nities for research work in this field would be unexcelled 
in any part of the country. In 1891, also, the Faculty of 
Medicine became an integral part of the teaching force of the 
University, and it seemed desirable to associate the research 
work conducted by this Faculty with the similar work con- 
ducted in other departments. Accordingly, in 1892, the 
Trustees established the Faculty of Pure Science, com- 
posed at the outset of the professors of biology (later 
described as professors of zodlogy), of the professor of 
physiology in the Faculty of Medicine, and of the profes- 
sors of mathematics, physics, mechanics, astronomy, chem- 
istry, geology, mineralogy, and botany in the Faculty of 
the School of Mines. 
In 1896 arrangements were made with the New York Bo- 
tanical Garden, by which the greater part of Columbia’s 
botanical collections and of its botanical library (including 
the famous herbarium and the valuable botanical books 
presented to the College in 1860 by Dr. John Torrey) 
were to be deposited in the museum of the Garden at 
Bronx Park, while the Garden, on its part, was to supply 
all needed facilities for research to the instructors and 
students of the University. These arrangements went 
into operation in 1899, and since that time the advanced 
work of the University in botany has been conducted at 
Bronx Park. 
With the establishment of the Faculty of Pure Science 
the reorganization of the teaching force, begun in 1890, 
was practically completed. This force was grouped in 
 
-P-A-G-E-319
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY 247 
seven Faculties, one having charge of the old College, 1880- 
three of professional schools, and three of non-professional 1° 
graduate education. All of these Faculties were integral 
parts of the University system and subject to the authority 
of the corporation. Each Faculty was self-governing, 
electing its own administrative officials ; all were repre- 
sented in a federal Council, in which a general will could 
be developed and expressed on questions of educational 
policy. In the University Council the natural sciences 
had equal voice with the “humanities” and the social 
sciences, for the representation of the College proper was 
regularly divided between these two groups. 
Outside of this consolidated and yet flexible organization, 
centralized as regarded legislation, decentralized as re- 
garded administration, living not only at the centre but in 
every part, the influence of the University and the scope 
of its work were expanding, and, were destined further to 
expand, by treaties with independent institutions. These 
might be mere reciprocity treaties; they might establish 
educational alliances of more or less intimacy, like those 
with the theological seminaries and with the Botanical 
Garden ; they might also, as the sequel was to show, es- 
tablish unions perfect on the educational side — unions 
which should subject the contracting institutions to the 
educational control of the University and leave them inde- 
pendent only on the side of property and finances. 
By treaties —or at least mainly by treaties — was solved 
one of the problems most urgently pressed upon the Col- 
lege and the University by a portion of the New York public 
and by President Barnard in his later reports, — the prob- 
lem of codperation in the higher education of women. Dr. 
Barnard urged the admission of women to the College 
proper on the same terms as those on which men were ad- 
mitted. He saw no valid objections to making the College 
completely coeducational. To this the Trustees would 
not consent; but in 1883 they established a so-called col- 
 
-P-A-G-E-320
248 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1880- legiate course for women. This was simply a system of 
1904 examinations without instruction. To those who com- 
pleted any part of the course certificates were issued ; 
and in 1887 it was provided that women who passed all 
the required examinations should receive the degree of 
bachelor of arts from Columbia, and should be permitted 
to proceed in the same manner, i.e. by non-resident study 
and by examinations, to the attainment of the higher non- 
professional degrees. 
In 1889 a separate College for women was established, 
independent in its finances, but dependent on Columbia 
for its instructors. In recognition of President Barnard’s 
interest in the higher education of women, the new College 
was called by his name. Its course of study was to be 
identical with that of Columbia, and to students fulfilling 
equivalent requirements Columbia was to grant degrees. 
After the establishment .of Barnard College no further 
registrations were received at Columbia in the collegiate 
course for women; all female candidates for the degrees 
of A.B., A.M., and Ph.D were registered as under- 
graduate or graduate students at Barnard. 
Barnard College was always necessarily a neighbor of 
Columbia. It was first established in Madison Avenue 
near 49th Street ; and when the University moved to its 
present site, Barnard moved also. 
The system of separate instruction presented no serious 
difficulties as regarded the curriculum of the first three 
years; but Barnard College found itself unable to secure 
for its seniors anything approaching the range of election 
offered to seniors in Columbia College, to say nothing of 
the graduate courses. Strong pressure was accordingly 
brought to bear on the non-professional Faculties of 
Columbia to open their courses to women. By arrange- 
ments which are described in the following chapter, the 
Barnard seniors and graduates were admitted in 1891 
to the majority of the courses offered by the Faculty of 
 
-P-A-G-E-321
  THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY 249 
Philosophy, and in 1897 to a large number of those 1880- 
offered by the Faculty of Pure Science. In 1898 women 1% holding the first degree were admitted to the purely graduate courses offered by the Faculty of Political Science 
in history and in economics. For the separate instruction 
of the Barnard seniors in mathematics, history, and econ- 
omics, provision had already been made in 1895, by the 
establishment in Columbia University, on Barnard foun- 
dations, of three new professorships. 
By treaty, again, Columbia added to its educational sys- 
tem a new professional school, for the training of teachers. 
Teachers College was an independent institution established 
to give to persons intending to become teachers a more sci- entific training than was afforded by the existing normal 
schools. It was an outgrowth of the Industrial Educa- tional Association, of which Nicholas Murray Butler became 
the executive head in 1886. It was founded in 1888 and chartered in 1889. From the outset it admitted men and women on an equal footing. February 1, 1893, an agree- ment was concluded between Columbia and Teachers Col- 
lege, by which the College was placed, as regarded courses 
leading to the degrees of A.B., A.M., and Ph.D., under the educational direction of the Columbia Faculty of Philoso- 
phy ; and the President of the College and the professors 
conducting the more advanced courses (those of the final 
year in the baccalaureate curriculum and those leading to the degrees of A.M. and Ph.D.) obtained seats in the Fac- 
ulty of Philosophy and votes in matters affecting Teachers 
College. Teachers College retained the right to grant certificates, but all degrees were to be granted by Columbia 
on such conditions as it might prescribe. Students in either institution were to enjoy the educational advantages 
of the other. Barnard College might become a party to this agreement, in which case women in Teachers College, 
by registering themselves in Barnard College, might be- come candidates for degrees. Barnard College acceded. «

  250 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1gg0- At the time when this agreement was executed, Teachers 
1904 College and Columbia occupied widely separated sites ; 
but Columbia had already decided to remove to its present 
location, and Teachers College arranged to accompany it. 
In January, 1898, a new agreement was concluded be- 
tween the two institutions “for the purpose of including 
Teachers College as a professional school for teachers in 
the educational system of the University.” The new 
points in this agreement were as follows: the President 
of the University became ez officio President of Teachers 
College; a Dean was to be appointed by the Trustees 
of Teachers College on the nomination of the President 
of the University ; the College was to be represented in 
the University Council by its Dean and by an elected 
delegate with the right to vote on matters affecting 
Teachers College ; certain Columbia professors were to 
have seats in the Faculty of Teachers College; courses 
leading to the degree of A.B. were to be subject to the 
approval of the Faculty of Columbia College, courses lead- 
ing to the degrees of A.M. and Ph.D. to the approval of 
the University Council; and the granting of certificates to 
students who at the same time should be candidates for a 
degree was likewise made subject to the approval of the 
University Council. There was again the stipulation that 
Barnard College might become a party to the agreement, 
and that in such case female students in Teachers College 
might become candidates for degrees by registering in 
Barnard College; and again Barnard College acceded. 
By an agreement dated January 19, 1900, which is still 
in force, Barnard College was similarly included in the 
educational system of the University, the President of the 
University becoming its President and a member of its 
Board of Trustees ; and its Dean being appointed by the 
President of the University “by and with the advice and 
consent of the Trustees of Barnard College.” The Dean 
of Barnard received a seat in the University Council and 
 
-P-A-G-E-323
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY 251 
the right to vote upon all questions. Barnard was also 1880- 
to be represented by an additional delegate whenever it ne 
should “maintain ten or more professors in its Faculty,” 
—a condition fulfilled in 1903. 
Under this agreement Barnard professors are appointed. 
by the University, on nomination by the Dean with the 
approval of the Trustees of Barnard College and of the 
President of the University. All the instruction for 
women leading to the degree of bachelor of arts, with 
the exception of certain courses offered in Teachers Col- 
lege, is given separately in Barnard College; and all in- 
struction for women holding the first degree and desiring 
to pursue non-professional graduate courses is given by 
the Columbia Faculties of Philosophy, Political Science, 
and Pure Science. 
Over its courses leading to the degree of bachelor of 
arts Barnard College has full control, but the bestowal of 
the degree upon its students by the University is made 
conditional on the maintenance of a standard equivalent 
to that of Columbia College, and power is vested in the 
University Council to prescribe the manner in which the 
equivalency of the two degrees shall be maintained. 
The terms on which Barnard College was brought into 
the educational system of the University differed in some 
respects, it will be observed, from those on which Teachers 
College was received in 1898. On April 6, 1900, a new 
agreement was made with the latter institution. This 
agreement, which is still in force, gives to the represen- 
tatives of Teachers College in the University Council 
the right to vote upon all questions. Teachers College 
grants neither degrees nor “diplomas,” but the Univer- 
sity confers “such diplomas as may from time to time be 
authorized by the Trustees of Teachers College and 
approved by the University” and ‘an appropriate degree 
in addition to a diploma” upon conditions “determined 
by the Faculty of Teachers College in conformity with 
 
-P-A-G-E-324
   252 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1880- regulations to be adopted by the University Council and 
   approved by the Trustees of the University.” 
Under these agreements Barnard and Teachers Colleges 
retain their separate charters, not surrendering any rights 
thereby granted but only waiving the exercise of certain 
rights. Each retains its separate property, and the finan- 
cial administration of each is conducted by its own Board 
of Trustees. In educational matters, however, both insti- 
tutions are subject to the control of the University, 
exercised chiefly through the University Council. In his 
report of 1900, President Low affirmed that “these cor- 
porations, while retaining their separate existence, have 
become in fact as completely a part of the educational 
system of the University as though the work that they 
are doing were being carried on under the University 
charter.” 
In the whole process of expansion by treaty, from the 
alliance with the Union Theological Seminary in 1891 to 
the agreement (presently to be noted) with the College 
of Pharmacy in 1904, the University Council has proved 
itself an instrument of great value. It has adapted itself 
by the flexibility of its organization to every form of 
combination. It has given to Columbia’s different allies, 
and to the same ally at different times, different degrees 
of representation, in proportion to the importance of the 
allied institution and the intimacy of the alliance. It 
has greatly aided in promoting complete educational 
union. It is hardly to be assumed that independent 
boards of trustees would as readily have surrendered their 
educational powers to another and similar board as to a 
strictly educational body. It is not saying too much to 
affirm that it is the Columbia University Council, itself 
a new thing in university government, that has made 
educational federations of this new type possible ; and if 
so brief an experience justifies any prophecy, it is safe to 
assert that this representative Council will so largely ‘ 
 
-P-A-G-E-325
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY 253 
insure the satisfactory working of these federations as to 1880- 
make them permanent. oe 
As regards the codperation of the University in the 
higher education of women, the solution at present 
attained at Columbia is as follows: separate college 
education to the close of the senior year, conducted largely 
by the same instructors who are teaching in Columbia 
College, and maintained through the supervisory powers 
of the University Council upon the same plane as the 
college education given to men; admission of women, 
on equal terms with men, to two professional schools 
(Teachers College and the College of Pharmacy) ; and 
admission of women holding the first degree to nearly 
all the advanced non-professional courses in the Uni- 
versity. 
As regards the shortened combined course for the 
first and professional degrees, the arrangements between 
Columbia, Barnard, and Teachers Colleges harmonize with 
the Columbia plan adopted in 1890 and further devel- 
oped in 1896. Seniors in Columbia and Barnard Colleges 
may elect professional courses offered by Teachers College, 
and such courses count at the same time towards the 
degree of A.B. and towards the professional diploma. 
Students who have completed the sophomore year in 
any college may obtain a first degree (in this case not 
the A.B. degree, but that of B.S.) on the completion 
of two years’ work in Teachers College. 
By their alliance with Columbia, Barnard and Teachers 
Colleges not only became sharers in the educational oppor- 
tunities offered by the University but also in its prestige. 
Barnard College has increased in numbers more rapidly 
than the old College itself. Teachers College also has 
grown rapidly, especially in the number of men attending 
its courses and in the number of its graduate students. 
One of the most significant results and signs of Colum- 
bia’s university development has been the growing mass 
 
-P-A-G-E-326
   254 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
ase of scientific literature produced by its professors and ad- 1904 
   vanced students, and the increasing number of journals 
and other serial publications edited at the University or 
with the codperation of its officers. Of the thirty-five 
serial publications appearing in 1904 which were under 
the control of the University or of its officers, twenty-six 
had come into existence since 1889. In 1893 there was 
organized, with the approval of the Trustees, the Col- 
umbia University Press, for the purpose of promoting the 
publication of works embodying the results of original 
research. It isa private association (incorporated June 8, 
1893), related directly to Columbia by the provisions that 
its Trustees shall be officers of the University and that 
the President of the University shall be its President. 
In the same year arrangements were made by which the 
Macmillan Company became publishing agents for the 
Press. d 
Until 1896 Columbia had modestly retained its old 
name. The University was still Columbia College ; the 
college proper was distinguished from the other schools 
as the “School of Arts.” As early as 1882 President 
Barnard asserted that Columbia “had taken on the func- 
tions and assumed the character of a proper university ” ; 
although, as he added, it still fell far short of what a fully 
appointed university ought to be. In the reports of the 
several Faculties to the Trustees’ committee on the eleva- 
tion of the course, in 1888, the complex of existing schools 
was frequently referred to as the University, and the 
Faculty of Political Science recommended “that the term 
‘College’ should be restricted to the disciplinary depart- 
ment and that the University, established in fact, should 
be called by its right name.” The reorganization of 1890 
produced a “ University Council”; in the following year, 
“university fellowships ” were established; and in the re- 
vised statutes adopted by the Trustees all of the Faculties 
except that of the School of Arts were described as the  
-P-A-G-E-327
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY 255 
“ University Faculties.” In 1891 the Trustees authorized 1880- 
the President to describe the institution, in its publications, 9 
as a university, but this the President was not yet inclined 
todo. On February 8, 1896, the Trustees resolved : 
“That in all official publications hereafter issued by or 
under authority of the Trustees, all the departments of 
instruction and research maintained and managed by this 
corporation may, for convenience, be designated collectively 
as ‘Columbia University in the City of New York’ or 
‘the University’; and the School of Arts, as the same is 
now known and described, may hereafter be designated 
as ‘Columbia College’ or ‘the College.’ ” 
This usage has since prevailed, although the legal 
name of the corporation remains unchanged. Since 1900 
Barnard and Teachers Colleges have been treated as 
integral parts of Columbia University. The property- 
holding corporations are Columbia, Barnard, and Teachers 
Colleges, and the College of Pharmacy; the educational 
unity is Columbia University. 
Revision of nomenclature once initiated, further changes 
were made. The different professional courses which 
had grown up in the School of Mines, or at least the 
principal groups of professional courses, were properly 
recognized, as President Barnard had recommended thir- 
teen years earlier, as separate schools. The name of the 
School of Mines, not merely time-honored but celebrated 
by the achievements of its graduates, was not abandoned, 
but it was restricted to describe the courses leading to 
the degrees of engineer of mines and metallurgical en- 
gineer. In addition there were established, or rather 
there were recognized, the School of Chemistry, with 
courses leading to the degree of bachelor of science; the 
Schools of Engineering, with courses leading respectively 
to the degrees of civil engineer, electrical engineer, and 
mechanical engineer; and the School of Architecture, 
with a course leading to the degree of bachelor of science. 
 
-P-A-G-E-328
256 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1880- These schools were left under the direction of the exist- 
Ie ing single Faculty, but this Faculty was now described, 
again as President Barnard had suggested, as the Faculty 
of Applied Science. 
By resolutions of June 2, 1902, the Trustees removed 
the School of Architecture from the jurisdiction of the 
Faculty of Applied Science. At the same time they 
removed from the Faculty of Philosophy the department 
of music. This department was established in 1896, with 
the aid of the Robert Center fund for instruction in 
music, the gift of Mrs. Ludlow; and it was organized by 
Columbia’s first professor of music, Edward Alexander 
McDowell. The purpose of the Trustees in removing 
architecture and music from their previous separate en- 
vironments was “that these departments may serve as 
the nucleus for an adequate and creditable university 
school of fine arts in the future.” In his report of 1902 
President Butler explained that it was no part of the plan 
that the University should give practical instruction in 
the fine arts. The University should give the historical, 
philosophical, and theoretical instruction, leaving to other 
teachers and organizations the practical training and ap- 
prenticeship which is a necessary part of all art education. 
Whenever the School of Fine Arts shall be organized, 
it will find some of the facilities it will require already 
provided. The Avery Architectural Library is more than 
a nucleus for an art library; it is already such a library. 
An agreement concluded in 1892 with the Metropolitan 
Museum gives Columbia’s art students opportunities 
similar to those which are secured to the students of 
biology by the arrangement made at the same time with 
the Museum of Natural History and shortly afterward 
with the New York Botanical Garden. Under the agree- 
ment with the Metropolitan Museum Columbia students 
are admitted on presentation of cards signed by the 
President of the University; permission is granted to

sketch or copy objects of art; and lectures may be de- 1880- 
livered in the rooms in which the collections are dis- 1° 
played. 
During the last decade of the century, Columbia made 
increasing provision for the extension of its educational 
advantages to others than its regular students. In 1892 
its system of public lectures was largely extended. For 
several years free lectures had been given at the College ; 
in 1892 arrangements were made with the authorities of 
Cooper Union, by which the Union gave the hall and 
defrayed the incidental expenses, and Columbia provided 
the lectures. The agreements already noted with the 
Museum of Natural History and the Metropolitan 
Museum made similar provision for public lectures, and 
since 1893 university lectures have been given at these 
institutions. 
Since 1898 “extension” courses have been given on a 
larger scale and in a more systematic way under the 
auspices of Teachers College. In 1898-1899 courses for 
teachers were given in Brooklyn, in codperation with the 
Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences; and also in the 
boroughs of Queens and Richmond. Since that time 
the work has steadily expanded and has been placed 
under the control of a special officer—the “Director of 
the Extension Department in Teachers College.” In 
1903-1904 the director reported 1590 extension students. 
Since 1900 the University has maintained a Summer 
Session, open to men and women on equal terms, and 
attended largely but not exclusively by teachers. It is 
conducted by an administrative. board composed of the 
President of the University, the Dean of Teachers Col- 
lege, and a Director. The range of subjects treated, the 
number of courses offered, and the number of students 
registered have increased rapidly. In 1903 summer 
courses in medicine were established. The attendance 
at the Summer Session of 1903 was 1001. 
s

  258 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
Both in the extension courses and in the Summer Session 
it has been the effort of the University authorities to main- 
tain the same standards as at the University in its other 
sessions. Under regulations adopted by Teachers Col- 
lege, extension and summer courses satisfactorily com- 
pleted count toward its professional diplomas. Under 
regulations adopted by the University Council, such 
courses may count toward the baccalaureate degree; and 
attendance in certain courses in the Summer Session 
may be accepted as a partial fulfilment of the residence 
requirements for the higher degrees. 
The opening of Columbia’s fourth half-century will be 
marked by further expansion. By treaty with the Col- 
lege of Pharmacy the University has secured another pro- 
fessional school; and through the generous gift of Mr. 
Joseph Pulitzer of New York it will be enabled to develop 
still another —a School of Journalism. 
The College of Pharmacy, founded in 1831, is older 
than any part of the University except Columbia College 
and the College of Physicians and Surgeons. It owns 
and occupies a building recently erected on West 65th 
Street between Amsterdam Avenue and Broadway. Geo- 
graphically as well as in other respects it constitutes 
a connecting link between the medical work of the Uni- 
versity on West 59th Street and the general scientific 
work conducted on Morningside Heights. A personal 
bond of connection also has long existed; Dr. Charles 
F. Chandler, one of the original Faculty of the School of 
Mines and long its Dean, a member also for many years 
of the Faculty of the College of Physician and Surgeons, 
has been for many years professor of chemistry in the 
College of Pharmacy and for several years its President. 
The agreement between Columbia and the College of Phar- 
macy, which was concluded March 15, and took effect July 
1, 1904, is drawn on the same lines as the agreement of
-P-A-G-E-333
  
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY 259 
1900 with Barnard and Teachers Colleges. Its declared 18g0- purpose is to include the College as a professional school 1% for pharmacists and pharmaceutical chemists in the educa- 
tional system of the University. The President of the University becomes its President; its Dean, to be ap- pointed by its own Board of Trustees on the nomination 
of the President, has seat and vote in the University 
Council; and when it shall maintain ten or more profes- 
sors in its Faculty, it is to have an additional representa- 
tive. Representatives of the University departments of botany, chemistry, physiological chemistry, and materia 
medica are to be added to its Faculty. The educational 
opportunities of the University and of the College. are made fully available to every qualified student who has duly matriculated in either institution. The University 
is to confer such degrees and diplomas as may be author- 
ized by the Trustees of the College of Pharmacy and 
approved by the University Council; the College retains 
the direction and control of its instruction and the right, 
with the approval of the Council, to grant certificates to students who are not candidates for a degree or diploma. 
The College of Pharmacy retains its property, and its 
finances are managed by its own Trustees. The agree- 
ment is terminable on one year’s notice. 
On July 20, 1908, the Columbia Trustees executed a 
formal agreement with Mr. Joseph Pulitzer of New York, 
to establish and maintain a School of Journalism as one 
of the professional schools of the University. For this 
purpose Mr. Pulitzer gave to the Trustees the sum of 
one million dollars, and promised to give an additional 
million when he should be satisfied that the school had 
been in successful operation for three years. Concerning 
the projected school President Butler said in his report 
of 1908: 
“With the establishment of a School of Journalism of university grade, a new academic field is entered upon. 
 
-P-A-G-E-334
  260 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1880- While in a sense this undertaking is experimental, yet it 
1904 is the judgment of the University, and that of a large 
and influential portion of the newspaper press, that it will 
be abundantly successful. If journalism is a calling for 
which no previous training is desirable or necessary, then 
it must be held to be an exception to all other professions, 
trades, and occupations. Natural aptitude will always lay 
the surest foundation for usefulness in any career, and 
practical experience well analyzed and understood is of 
prime importance ; but between the two lie the study of 
principles and practices, the acquirement of the subsidiary 
information which must be drawn upon, and the practice 
under criticism which gives to the beginner the benefit of 
the experience of others. All these this University can 
furnish for journalism, as it furnishes them for engineer- 
ing and for teaching. The University cannot guarantee 
to produce good newspaper men any more than it can 
guarantee to produce good engineers or good teachers ; 
but it can and will train students to become such if they 
have the root of the matter in them. 
“Tn organizing and carrying on the School of Journal- 
ism the Trustees, the University Council, and the Faculty 
of Journalism will have the advantage from the outset of 
the suggestions and criticisms of an Advisory Board to 
be composed of ‘the foremost journalists and editors pos- 
sessing expert knowledge on the subject,’ the members of 
which will be appointed by the Trustees upon the nomi- 
nation of Mr. Pulitzer.” 
Pending the appointment of the advisory board, a com- 
mittee appointed by President Butler framed a report 
regarding the organization and academic relations of the 
School of Journalism. This report was submitted to and 
amended and approved by the University Council. At the 
same time the Trustees’ committee on buildings authorized 
the preparation of preliminary plans for a building, to be 
placed on the Amsterdam Avenue side of the Quadrangle, 
south of Fayerweather Hall. 
At the opening of its fourth half-century, Columbia, as 
an educational unity, will consist of eleven faculties, con-
-P-A-G-E-335
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY 261 
ducting fourteen colleges and schools. In this enumera- 1880- 
tion the inchoate Faculty of Fine Arts is not included, nor Ae 
any of the allied institutions that are not subject to the 
educational control of the University. Classified from 
the point of view indicated at the beginning of this chap- 
ter, Columbia will include (1) two colleges of the familiar 
Anglo-American type; (2) three non-professional gradu- 
ate schools, corresponding very closely to the most recent 
divisions of the German Faculty of Philosophy; (8) nine 
professional schools, two of which, those of Law and Medi- 
cine, correspond to traditional university faculties of the 
old world, while the remaining seven—the Schools of 
Mines, Engineering, Chemistry, Pharmacy, Architecture, 
Journalism, and Teachers College — represent the wider 
hospitality and more catholic ideals of the American 
university. 
Of the professional schools one only, the School of Law, 
is a university school, in the sense that a preliminary col- 
lege training is required for admission to its courses. 
The Schools of Applied Science and of Architecture, 
however, have raised their entrance requirements very 
considerably beyond those of Columbia College, and the 
average age of their first-year students is greater by 
nearly two years than the average age of the College 
freshmen. In Teachers College, moreover, no students 
are admitted as candidates for a degree except upon the 
basis of a preliminary two-year college course. 
The equipment with which the students enter Columbia’s 
professional schools is, of course, in a considerable pro- 
portion of cases, in excess of that which is required. In 
his report of 1903, President Butler pointed out that 30 
per cent of the medical students, 14 per cent of the 
students in the Schools of Applied Science, and 35 per 
cent of the students in Teachers College had already ob- 
tained a first degree. In the whole University there were, 
in 1902-1908, over twelve hundred graduate students, 
 
-P-A-G-E-336
262 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1sg0- and of these nearly one-half were students in the pro- 1904 fessional schools. 
The policy of placing all the professional schools upon 
a basis of preliminary college training, advocated as we 
have seen by President Low and by the University Coun- 
cil, was reaffirmed by President Butler in his first report 
(1902). That it has the support of practically the entire 
teaching body was shown by an inquest instituted in the 
autumn of 1902. Those advocating such a policy num- 
bered one hundred and two, those dissenting nine. The 
vote of each professional Faculty, and the length of the 
preliminary college course advocated for each school, are 
indicated in the following table:

  The history of the development of the University, as 
outlined in the preceding pages, is substantially a history 
of the formation or acquisition of faculties and schools. 
The development of new departments of instruction and 
research falls properly within the special histories of the 
several schools. Since 1896, however, there has devel- 
oped, without legislative impulse or warrant, a third form 
of organization, which in many instances runs across the 
faculty lines, viz. : that of the so-called “divisions.” The 
division is an association of departments naturally related 
and having many common interests. The ends subserved 
   
-P-A-G-E-337
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY 263 
by the divisional organization are the better correlation 1880- 
of courses and, through “divisional announcements,” the 1 
clearer indication to students of the opportunities offered 
in the same general field of studies in different parts of 
the University. Spontaneously developed, the divisional 
organization has been extended and systematized by ad- 
ministrative action, and the annual statements published 
by the University regarding courses of instruction and of 
research have assumed in President Butler’s administration 
(except as regards the professional courses in law and in 
medicine) the form of divisional announcements. The 
divisions are not legislative or administrative but delib- 
erative bodies. They have no authority over the depart- 
ments of which they are composed, nor have they any 
immunities against the faculties in which the several 
departments are included. 
In considering the causes of Columbia’s rapid growth, 
the effect of the removal of the University in 1897 from 
its inadequate and unattractive situation on 49th Street 
to the spacious grounds and dignified buildings of its new 
home must not be forgotten. Apart from the fact that 
many departments, notably those in the Faculties of Pure 
and Applied Science, gained for the first time the room 
required for the proper conduct of their work, the moral 
effects of the removal on the Faculties, the students, and 
the public were very great. When the removal was 
being planned, Professor Ware said, with more truth than 
is usually found in an epigram, that it would transform 
Columbia from a private into a public institution. From 
the moment at which the removal was announced, the 
springs of private benefaction were opened ; and in more 
than one year of President Low’s administration the gifts 
to the University greatly exceeded in value all those re- 
ceived by Columbia prior to 1890. 
The growth of Columbia’s teaching force and student

Scarcely less significant are the figures regarding the 
increase of the Columbia Library; for while a great 
library does not make a great university, a university is 
not conceivable without a great library. In 1864 the 
Columbia Library included about 15,000 volumes. In 
1889 the number of volumes was nearly 100,000; in 1904 
it was 362,000. One advantage which this library pos- 
sesses by virtue of its recent rapid growth is, as the 
Librarian has stated in a recent article, that “its list of 
‘dead books’ is very small.” 
Here again the resources and opportunities of the 
Columbia of to-day are imperfectly indicated by its own 
possessions. Under reciprocity arrangements similar to 
those which have so greatly expanded its educational 
activities, the students of Columbia have access not only 
to the libraries of the New York Botanical Garden, the 
College of Pharmacy, the Metropolitan Museum, the 
Museum of Natural History, and the General and Union 
Theological Seminaries, but also to the Lenox and Astor 
Libraries and to the libraries of the New York Historical 
Association, the New York Academy of Medicine, and 
other similar institutions and organizations. 
The present position of Columbia was felicitously de- 
scribed by President Butler in his first report (1902): 
“Under the leadership of President Low the hopes and 
the prophecies that had been cherished and made for a 
 
-P-A-G-E-339
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY 265 
generation were fulfilled. ... The college which had served New York so long and so well became the modern many-sided university, of which the old Columbia College is the foundation. “This University, carried to a new and fitting home on a site of great beauty and appropriate- ness, has quietly and naturally taken its place as one of the small group of truly national universities . . . re- flecting, each in its own way, the nation’s idealism, its love of knowledge, its zeal in investigation and invention, and its practical skill in applying scientific principles in action.” 
This position Columbia has attained by discounting the support which the citizens of New York owe it. In spite of the appreciation of its property and ,the generous gifts and bequests it has of late received, its means have become inadequate for even its most pressing needs. Its rapid development of numerous branches of instruction and research, undertaken simultaneously with its removal to a new site and the erection of new buildings, has so strained its resources that it is now carrying a debt of nearly five millions, with a correspondingly heavy interest charge. It is true that the property of the University has increased during this period by an amount much greater than this debt, but the additions to its property have been of such a character as to increase expenditure far more than they have increased income. For several years, accordingly, the University budgets have shown formidable deficits. In large measure these deficits have thus far been covered by annual subscriptions; but in soliciting and obtaining these subscriptions the University has been consuming its principal, for the generosity of the public is an asset which should contribute to the development of a university rather than to its mere main- tenance. To put the University on a satisfactory financial basis, the existing schools and departments which rest on the Columbia foundation should receive productive endow ments to the amount of at least four millions, and Barnard 
 
-P-A-G-E-340
266 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1980- and Teachers Colleges should receive for the same pur- 
1904 pose two millions. This estimate does not include the 
erection of new buildings nor the endowment of new 
departments of instruction and research. New buildings, 
however, are already needed, and if Columbia is to main- 
tain its leading position among the great American uni- 
versities, it will need further endowments for the next 
ten years at the rate of at least half a million a year. 
During the past quarter of a century, New York has 
obtained, with little cost to its citizens, a national uni- 
versity of the first rank. The question of the next 
quarter of a century, or rather of the next few years, 
will be: Will New York maintain Columbia in this 
position ? Munroe SMITH.

CHAPTER II 
THE GRADUATE SCHOOLS 
POLITICAL SCIENCE, PHILOSOPHY, AND PURE SCIENCE 
“THE non-professional graduate schools” is the name 
usually given to those parts of Columbia University in 
which courses are offered leading to the degrees of A.M. 
and Ph.D., and in which students who have received an 
adequate general education are trained in methods of 
research in history and the social sciences, in the other 
“humanities,” and in mathematics and the natural sciences. 
The name is not happily chosen; at least it does not 
accurately define the place or purpose of these schools in 
the university system. They are not the only schools 
frequented by graduates; nor are they the only schools 
which require for admission a preliminary course of 
study in a college or scientific school. Their students 
are not working without reference to preparation for 
self-support, and their courses are designed to prepare 
men and women for a variety of professions. There is, 
however, a real difference between these schools and the 
older professional schools. The callings for which they 
are preparing their students are peculiarly those of public 
service. The majority of their graduates become college 
professors or instructors in secondary schools ; a minority 
become civil servants of the nation or of the several com- 
monwealths, or journalists, or directors of organized chari- 
ties, or curators of scientific institutions, or members of 
some other of the new professions, numerous already and 
rapidly increasing, which serve a complex and progressive 
society — a society that is constantly developing new needs 
and meeting them in new ways.

1880- 
1890 268 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
In their relation to the preliminary general education 
given by the college, in the field of studies which they 
seek to cover, in the character and range of professions 
for which they prepare their students, these schools are 
almost precisely equivalent to the philosophical faculty of 
a German university. The analogy is most striking in 
the case of those German universities which have sub- 
divided their philosophical faculty; for in all such 
divisions it is now the natural sciences, and now the 
political, that receive separate organization; and when- 
ever a German faculty of political sciences is organized, 
it includes, like that at Columbia, the professors of public 
law. * 
In another respect these Columbia schools discharge 
the same function as the German philosophical faculty. 
Connected with the professional faculties in a uni- 
versity that is really a unity, that interposes no barrier 
to the free movement of its students across its faculty 
lines, these schools, like the German philosophical fac- 
ulty, serve to broaden and liberalize the work of the 
professional schools and to inspire them with the spirit 
of research. Further, by encouraging new combinations 
of study, such schools in such a university serve not 
merely to develop existing sciences but to create new 
sciences. It was on these considerations that the organ- 
izer of the oldest of these schools laid especial stress; 
and it was especially to secure free room for the develop- 
ment of legal science, as distinguished from legal tech- 
nique, and of the social sciences most closely related to 
law, that the School of Political Science was founded. 
The successive establishment of the three graduate 
schools has been described in the preceding chapter; 
it remains only to follow their development. 
In accordance with the statute of June 7, 1880, the 
School of Political Science was opened October 4 of

the same year. Its teaching force consisted of Professor 1880- 
John W. Burgess (constitutional and international history neal 
and law), who since 1876 had been a member of the Col- 
lege and Law Faculties; Adjunct Professors Archibald 
Alexander (philosophy) and Richmond Mayo-Smith (po- 
litical economy and social science), members respectively 
since 1877 and since 1878 of the College Faculty; 
and two lecturers, Munroe Smith (Roman law) and Clif- 
ford R. Bateman (administrative law), who were also 
appointed instructors in history in the College. Mr. 
Bateman’s appointment, although authorized in 1880, 
dated from 1881, when he completed his studies at the 
Ecole Libre des Sciences Politiques in Paris, and reported 
for duty at Columbia. Three members of the original 
teaching body, Mayo-Smith, Munroe Smith, and Bate- 
man, had been pupils of Professor Burgess at Amherst 
College; the two latter were also graduates of the 
Columbia Law School. All five had studied in Ger- 
man universities. Until 1888 no addition was made to 
the permanent teaching staff; nor was there any change, 
except that in 1883, after the death of Mr. Bateman 
at the outset of a career that promised to be one of 
notable service to the University and to the country, 
Frank J. Goodnow, an alumnus of the Law School and 
one of the first students in the School of Political Science, 
was appointed lecturer in administrative law and in- 
structor in history. In October, 1884, after a year’s 
study in France and Germany, Mr. Goodnow entered 
upon the active discharge of his duties. Mr. Munroe 
Smith was advanced to professorial rank in 1883; Mr. 
Goodnow in 1887. In 1888 Edwin R. A. Seligman was 
promoted from a lectureship to an adjunct professorship 
of political economy, and for a year the Faculty included 
six professors ; but in 1889 Professor Alexander resigned 
his position in the College and Political Science Faculties 
on the ground of ill-health.
-P-A-G-E-348
1880- 
1890 270 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
  The statute of June 7, 1880, described the new schook 
as one “designed to prepare young men for the duties 
of public life.” The first prospectus of the school stated 
that its prime aim was “the development of all the 
branches of the political sciences”; its secondary aim, 
“the preparation of young men for all the political 
branches of the public service.” If this latter purpose 
could have been largely realized, a new professional 
school would have been established. As late as 1882, 
President Barnard, in his annual report, included the 
School of Political Science among the professional schools 
of Columbia.! In its early years it in fact resembled a pro- 
fessional school, in that its students were grouped in three 
classes and pursued a prescribed course of study for three 
years. The prescribed course of study, however, was 
necessitated by the small number of instructors. With 
the gradual enlargement of the Faculty after 1888, the 
elective principle appeared; parallel courses, the one 
mainly legal, the other mainly economic, were developed ; 
the prescribed order of studies and the division into 
classes disappeared; and early in the second decade of 
the school’s existence, when its Faculty had been greatly 
strengthened on its historical side, the system that now 
obtains was adopted, by which the student selects, from 
a considerable number of subjects, a “major” and two 
“minors,” and, with such restrictions only as result from 
the character of the courses, pursues his studies in what- 
ever order he finds most convenient. 
Admission to the first-year class was based on the com- 
pletion of the junior year in College, or an equivalent 
education. The studies of the first year were political phi- 
losophy, the literature of the political sciences, constitu- 
1 In 1886, however, Dr. Barnard dated the beginning of ‘‘ the third era 
in the history of our College, the period of university instruction,’? from 
the establishment in 1880 of graduate instruction and of the School of 
Political Science, ‘‘ which is not a professional school.’’

tional history, and political economy. This year was 18s0- 
organized outside of the old College as a competing senior 18% 
year, because the Trustees were unwilling so to extend 
the range of election in the College as to admit all or 
even the majority of these subjects into the A.B. course. 
Students satisfactorily completing the work of the first 
year received the degree of Ph.B. What the Trustees 
were unwilling to do all at once, they nevertheless did 
piecemeal: the first-year courses in the School of Political 
Science were gradually made senior electives in the Col- 
lege. As early as 1884 Columbia seniors who remained 
in the College and were at the same time matriculated 
in the School of Political Science were able to secure 
simultaneously the two degrees of A.B. and Ph.B. To 
escape from this situation it was enacted by the Trustees 
that the degree of A.B. might be awarded on recommenda- 
tion of the Faculty of Political Science with the concur- 
rence of the Faculty of the College—a system which 
remained in operation until 1898. The degree of Ph.B. 
was awarded on recommendation of the Faculty of Politi- 
cal Science as late as 1895. Since that time students who 
have completed the junior year, although by statute en- 
titled to enter the school as regular students, have not been 
able to obtain a first degree on work in political science 
except by registering in Columbia College. 
In the first years of the school, until the Law School 
moved into the new Library building on 49th Street, the 
legal lectures of the Faculty of Political Science were 
delivered in Great Jones Street. During these years 
the tuition fee in the Law School was $100; in the 
School of Political Science, $150. The lectures in constitu- 
tional and international law were open to the Law School 
students as such, because Professor Burgess was a mem- 
ber of the Law Faculty ; the lectures in administrative 
law and in Roman law were open only to those Law 
School students who paid an additional $50.
-P-A-G-E-350
1880- 
1890 
  272 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
The school began work in 1880 with a first-year class 
of eleven men. Five of these were Columbia seniors who 
left the College and sacrificed the degree of A.B. in 
order to avail themselves of the opportunities offered in 
the new school; four were students in the Law School ; 
two came from other institutions and devoted themselves 
exclusively to work in political science. In the follow- 
ing years the school grew steadily but slowly. In 1883— 
1884 it had eighteen students not registered under any 
other faculty; eight students who were also College 
seniors but who were taking a full year’s work in politi- 
cal science, and sixteen students who were simultaneously 
pursuing studies in private law — in all, forty-two. Dur- 
ing the next six years, the fact that practically all the 
first-year studies in political science were made elective 
in the College increased the number of seniors attending 
courses in the school. The increase of the law tuition 
fee to $150 and the admission of law students to courses 
in political science without additional payment were 
followed by a considerable increase in the number of 
students simultaneously pursuing courses in public and 
in private law; and this combination was further en- 
couraged when in 1885 the Trustees empowered the 
Faculty to recommend for the degree of A.M. those 
students who satisfactorily completed the studies of its 
second year. At the close of its first decade the Faculty 
of Political Science had made some progress in the 
work of convincing the students in the Law School that 
public law and jurisprudence constituted desirable parts of 
a legal education. About eighteen per cent of them were 
taking courses in the School of Political Science, and the 
total registration in that school had risen to ninety-eight. 
In the task of developing an independent body of 
students the Faculty had been less successful. In 1890 
the number studying exclusively in the School of Politi- 
cal Science was little greater than in 1884. . The second-
-P-A-G-E-351
  
THE GRADUATE SCHOOLS 273 
ary aim of its Faculty, to create a professional school to 1880- 
train young men for governmental service, had not been 16% 
realized ; and the scepticism with which the Trustees 
had regarded this experiment (see above p. 227) was 
shown to be justified. Neither in the nation nor in the 
states was the civil service on such a basis that a young 
man, however well prepared, could enter it with the pros- 
pect of an assured and important career. 
By 1890 several former students of the school had 
made their way into the service of the federal or 
state governments, and in the ensuing fourteen years, as 
may be seen by an examination of the Dean’s annual 
reports, such appointments became more numerous. In 
this country, however, law is the chief avenue to politi- 
cal life, and the lawyers are the political class; and the 
Faculty of Political Science has done far more “to pre- 
pare young men for the duties of public life” by teaching 
the students in the Law School those things which every 
man in public life ought to know, but which the colleges 
cannot teach adequately and the schools of law, as a rule, 
do not teach at all, than it could have done by training 
an equal number of young men for departmental clerk- 
ships. 
In 1890 the great majority of the graduates of the school 
were practising lawyers. A number of its former students 
had become journalists, and some of these were holding edi- 
torial positions. A larger number had become teachers. 
The school had already educated four men who were, or 
were to be, members of its Faculty, and several of its gradu- 
ates were teaching in other colleges or universities. As yet, 
however, few students were coming to the school who in- 
tended to become teachers. This was partly due to the fact 
that the Faculty of Political Science was not yet fully de- 
veloped on the economic side, and was practically undevel- 
oped on the side of history. All the professors employed 
the historical method and offered historical courses 3 but 
2
-P-A-G-E-352
  Q74 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1880- three of them were primarily lawyers, and the other two 
1890 economists. That the school had not yet obtained its 
clientéle of students intending to become teachers was, 
however, mainly due to the fact that other universities 
had developed earlier than Columbia the system of attract- 
ing graduate students by fellowships. The first step taken 
in this direction at Columbia was the establishment in 
1886 and maintenance until 1891 by Mr. Jesse Seligman 
of four fellowships in the School of Political Science of 
the value of $250 each. 
During its first decade, however, the school had realized 
in no mean degree the “ prime aim” announced in 1880: 
the development of the political sciences. Its officers had 
become known by their publications, and the doctor-dis- 
sertations of its students, though few in number (but 
twenty-five doctorates were awarded in the first ten 
years), were of high grade. The Faculty of Political 
Science established, for the doctor’s degree, the require- 
ments which have since been accepted by the other facul- 
ties and sanctioned by the University Council, viz.: oral 
examination of the candidate, at one time, in the whole 
field of advanced study selected by him ; demonstration 
of his ability to read Latin, French, and German ; sub- 
mission of a printed dissertation, and the defence of this 
dissertation before the Faculty. In the first years of the 
school, the submission of typewritten copies was per- 
mitted; but this alternative was not encouraged, and 
only in two cases was the doctorate bestowed upon 
candidates who did not print their dissertations. 
Since 1890 the best of the doctor-dissertations have 
been published in a series entitled Studies in History, 
Economics, and Public Law. Of these Studies a nine- 
teenth volume appeared in 1904. The series has been 
well received and is self-supporting. 
For a number of years former students of the School 
of Political Science and graduates of the Law School who
-P-A-G-E-353
       THE GRADUATE SCHOOLS 275 
  had pursued studies in public law maintained, with the 180- codperation of the Faculty, an “Academy of Political 189 
Science,” in which papers were read and discussed by 
the members. The excellence of many of these papers, 
and the lack, at that time, of any suitable medium for the 
publication of such literature, suggested the establishment 
of a journal, and in March, 1886, the first number of the 
Political Science Quarterly appeared. The Academy did 
not long flourish in its original form ; in 1897 it wag 
reorganized on different lines, as an association of leading 
jurists, publicists, and economists, and it has since been 
chiefly active in providing public addresses at Columbia, 
from its own members or from other persons, on topics of 
contemporary interest. The Political Science Quarterly 
was recognized, from the outset, as a journal of great 
value, and it is at present (1904) prosperously completing 
its nineteenth year. 
In connection with the Academy of Political Science 
the Trustees established in 1887 three prize lectureships, 
each of the annual value of $500 and tenable for three 
years, to be awarded to members of the Academy who 
should contribute papers of especial excellence. These 
prize lectureships served a useful purpose in promoting 
research ; and so long as the Faculty itself was small, the 
prize lecturers, each of whom was held to deliver a course 
of twenty lectures, met a real need in extending the range 
of instruction offered in the school. These lectureships 
were discontinued by the Trustees in 1900. 
The second decade of the School of Political Science 
was signalized by the establishment of much closer rela- 
tions with the School of Law; by a large increase in the 
Faculty, particularly in the departments of economics and 
social science and of history ; and by the formation, prin- 
cipally in these departments, of a large body of graduate 
students not primarily registered in any other faculty. 
Much of this advance was due to the cordial support
-P-A-G-E-354
276 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1s90- which the Faculty received from President Low —sup- 
1904 ort which assumed, more often than was generally known, 
the form of financial assistance in the development of its 
work. 
The lengthening of the course in the School of Law, which 
was put into effect in 1888 and produced a third-year class in 
1890-1891; the recognition of the courses in public law and 
jurisprudence as elective studies for the professional degree; 
the growing conviction in the Law School itself that these 
studies were of professional as well as intrinsic value — 
these changes gradually increased the proportion of stu- 
dents pursuing a combined course in private and public law. 
In 1901-1902 half of the students in the Law School, and 
in the two following years two-thirds, were registered as at- 
tending one or more courses under the Faculty of Political 
Science. An increasing proportion, moreover, elected 
such courses as a part of their work for the professional 
degree, and not merely as extra or “ optional” work. 
On the other hand, the increased intensity of the pro- 
fessional work has made it more difficult for the students 
of the Law School to engage in research work in the field 
of public law. In spite of the great increase, since 1890, 
in the number of students pursuing courses in public law 
and jurisprudence and the corresponding increase in the 
number of master’s degrees conferred in this department, 
the number of doctorates attained by candidates in this 
field has remained stationary (from 1883 to 1892, nine- 
teen; from 1893 to 1902, twenty), and an increasing 
proportion of the doctorates in public law has been con- 
ferred upon candidates not at any time connected with 
the Columbia Law School. 
In the first years of its second decade the Faculty was 
materially strengthened : three new professors, Herbert L. 
Osgood (history), William A. Dunning (history and polit- 
ical philosophy), and John Bassett Moore (international 
law), were added in 1890 and 1891, and a fourth, Franklin 
 
-P-A-G-E-355
     THE GRADUATE SCHOOLS 277 
H. Giddings (sociology), in 1894. Mr. Dunning had been 1890- 
a lecturer in the school since 1888. Mr. Moore was called 14 
to Columbia from the State Department at Washington, 
Mr. Giddings from Bryn Mawr College. Before receiy- 
ing the call to a chair at Columbia, Professor Giddings 
had for two years delivered lectures in the School of 
Political Science. The establishment of a full professor- 
ship of sociology was made possible by the liberality of 
President Low. These additions, which nearly doubled 
the teaching force; the simultaneous establishment of 
twenty-four university fellowships, a third of which were 
regularly conferred in political science; and the reciproc- 
ity arrangements established with the theological semi- 
naries of the city and its environs, were followed by an 
increase in the separate (“primarily registered”) student 
body from twenty-four in 1890-1891 to ninety-four in 
1894-1895. 
The establishment of a separate chair of sociology 
enabled the department of economics and social science 
to put largely into operation plans devised by Professor 
Mayo-Smith and submitted to the Trustees by President 
Low, January 8, 1894. Not only was the historical and 
theoretical instruction in social science greatly extended, 
and a statistical laboratory established, but “ field work” 
was also initiated in codperation with the charitable insti- 
tutions of the city. “The city,” Professor Mayo-Smith 
declared, “is the natural laboratory of social science, just 
as the hospitals are of medical science”; and the relations 
which the department has been able to establish with the 
Charity Organization Society, the Brooklyn Bureau of 
Charities, the State Charities Aid Association, the Uni- 
versity Settlement Society, and the East Side House give 
its instructors and its students unsurpassed opportuni- 
ties for practical work and for scientific investigation. 
On December 4, 1898, the Trustees adopted the follow- 
ing resolution : —    Si i a he  
-P-A-G-E-356
278 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
3890- “That, in commemoration of the long and intimate rela- 
1904 tions of Mr. Fish with the College, and in recognition of 
his distinguished services in the conduct of international 
affairs in the settlement of many grave controversies 
arising during his term of office as Secretary of State, 
the chair of International Law and Diplomacy in Columbia 
College shall hereafter be known as the Hamilton Fish 
Chair of International Law and Diplomacy.” 
Meantime the reorganization of the University in 1890- 
1892 had created two other graduate schools, each under the 
charge of a distinct faculty, had provided that each of the 
Faculties should elect its own Dean and Secretary, and had 
established a central representative body, the University 
Council, with especial authority over the non-professional 
courses and degrees. All that the Faculty of Political 
Science had to do to accommodate itself to the new 
order was to elect as Dean its organizer and senior pro- 
fessor, and to submit for approval by the Council its regu- 
lations for the higher degrees. Professor Mayo-Smith 
was its first delegate to the University Council. 
The Faculty of Philosophy met for organization May 9, 
1890. It consisted, at the outset, of ten professors 
and adjunct professors: Henry Drisler (Greek), Charles 
Sprague Smith (Romance languages), Augustus C. Mer- 
riam (Greek), Thomas.R. Price (English), Hjalmar H. 
Boyesen (Germanic languages), John D. Quackenbos 
(English), Richard J. H. Gottheil (Semitic languages), 
Harry Thurston Peck (Latin), Nicholas Murray Butler 
(philosophy, psychology, and ethics), and William H. 
Carpenter (Germanic languages). All these were mem- 
bers of the Faculty of Arts (College), but so rapid had 
been the growth of Columbia that only one of the ten had 
been a member of its professorial corps for more than ten 
years. The new Faculty was a young faculty, in age 
as well as in service, and it organized itself by electing

one of its youngest members, Professor Butler, as its 1 
Dean, and another, Professor Peck, as its delegate to the 
Council. In the following five years this Faculty lost 
half of its original membership. Professors Drisler 
and Quackenbos were emerited; Professor Sprague 
Smith resigned; and Professors Merriam and Boyesen 
were removed by death in the fulness of their powers. 
In 1895, however, all the other officers associated with the 
school at the time of its organization, James McKeen 
Cattell (psychology), Bernard F. O’Connor (Romance 
languages), Edward D. Perry (Greek), A.V. W. Jackson 
(Indo-Iranian and English), and James H. Hyslop (logic 
and ethics), had been promoted to professorial rank, and all 
these except Professor O’Connor (resigned 1894) were still 
members of the Faculty. New members had also been ap- 
pointed as follows: Adolphe Cohn (Romance languages) 
and George E. Woodberry (literature) in 1891 ; Brander 
Matthews (literature) in 1892; Henry A. Todd (Romance 
philology) and George R. Carpenter (thetoric) in 1898 ; 
James R. Wheeler (Greek) and James C. Egbert (Latin) 
in 1895. 
In 1890 this Faculty was almost exclusively a faculty 
of philology and letters, nine of its ten members belonging 
to this group. Its present division of education, with 
eight professors, and its division of philosophy, psychol- 
ogy, and anthropology, which at present (1904) includes 
two departments and eight professors, were represented 
in 1890 by Professor Butler. In 1895 there were two 
additional professors in the department of philosophy and 
psychology, but nine other professors had been appointed 
in the various departments of languages and literatures. 
From the beginning the professional side of the work of 
this Faculty, the training of teachers, wasstrongly developed. 
This result was largely furthered by the alliance with Teach- 
ers College, contracted in 1893 and consolidated in 1898.

   280 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1890- Teachers College are in many respects analogous to those 1904 which have been established between the School of Political 
Science and the Law School ; although, owing partly to historical reasons, the professional connections of the 
younger Faculty were established more easily and have be- 
come more intimate than those of the School of Political 
Science. In each case the non-professional Faculty has 
codperated with the professional in the work of instruction, 
and has simultaneously leavened it with the research 
spirit. Doctorates in philosophy, psychology, and educa- 
tion preponderated during the first decade of the School 
of Philosophy, as did doctorates in public law during the 
first decade of the School of Political Science. 
Until the removal of both institutions to Morningside 
Heights, the alliance with Teachers College had little influence on the growth of the student body in the School 
of Philosophy. This school, however, enjoyed from its establishment the advantage of the university fellowship 
system; it drew students from the theological seminaries; 
and with its large teaching force and wide range of subjects 
it attracted from the outset a considerable body of students. 
In the year preceding the organization of the Faculty of Philosophy, 35 graduate students were registered under 
the Faculty of Arts (College). In its first year the School of Philosophy had a total enrolment of 92 students, 
32 of whom were seniors in Columbia College, five! were 
graduate students primarily registered under other facul- ties, 47 were graduate students, and eight were special students primarily registered under the Faculty of Phi- 
losophy. Of the 47 graduate students primarily regis- tered in this school, 23 held the master’s degree and three the doctor’s degree. Four years later (1894-1895) the total enrolment was 190: 51 seniors, 27! graduates 
1 Approximate figures. The early reports from the Faculty of Phi- losophy show the number of graduates in the school, but the primary and secondary registrations were not separated.

    THE GRADUATE SCHOOLS 281 
primarily registered elsewhere, 93 graduates and 19 special 1890- 1904 
students primarily registered in this school. 
The prime purpose of the School of Philosophy, as of 
the other graduate schools, has been, from the outset, the 
promotion of research. In its first decade (1891-1900) 
the Faculty of Philosophy graduated 54 doctors, 23 of 
whom had their major subjects in the department of 
philosophy, psychology, and education. Professor Butler’s 
Educational Review, which first appeared in 1890, promptly 
attained the highest rank among publications in this field. 
Members of the Faculty have established and maintain 
seven series: Contributions to Philosophy, Psychology, and 
Education, since 1894; Studies in Comparative Literature 
and Germanic Studies, since 1899; Studies in English, 
Indo-Iranian Series, and Studies in Romance Philology and 
Literature, since 1900; Studies in Classical Philology and 
Oriental Studies, since 1902. 
In the general reorganization of the University in 1890, 
advanced instruction and research training in mathe- 
matics and the natural sciences were assigned to the 
Faculty of the School of Mines, later designated as the 
Faculty of Applied Science. In 1890-1891 nine students 
holding the A.B. degree or its equivalent were registered 
under this Faculty as candidates for the higher degrees. 
In 1891-1892 the number had risen to fifteen. In 1892 
the School of Pure Science was established and placed in 
charge of a distinct faculty. The original Faculty of Pure 
Science consisted of thirteen professors and adjunct pro- 
fessors, representing ten departments ; viz., mathematics, 
physics, mechanics, astronomy, geology, mineralogy, chem- 
istry, botany, biology, and physiology. Its members were: 
J. H. Van Amringe, Thomas Egleston, Charles F. Chand- 
ler, Ogden N. Rood, John G. Curtis, John K. Rees, Na- 
thaniel L. Britton, Alfred J. Moses, James F. Kemp, Henry 
F. Osborn, Edmund B. Wilson, Michael I. Pupin, and Wil-

1890- liam Hallock. All these were members of the School of 
1004 Mines Faculty, except Professor Curtis (physiology), who 
   was a member of the Faculty of Medicine, and Professors 
Osborn and Wilson (biology), who had been appointed 
officers of the University during the previous year. 
The Faculty of Pure Science met for organization Sep- 
tember 30, 1892. It elected Professor Osborn as its Dean, 
and Professor Rees as its delegate to the University 
Council. In this Faculty the line of cleavage between 
the older and the younger group was very marked. Four 
of the thirteen had been in the service of Columbia for 
nearly thirty years, and two for more than ten years, 
while the appointments of the remaining seven to pro- 
fessorial rank at Columbia dated from the preceding two 
years, 1890-1892. All but three of the thirteen are still 
(1904) members of the Faculty. Professor Britton re- 
signed in 1896 to become director of the New York 
Botanical Garden, and was made professor emeritus —a 
change which in no wise interrupted his connection with 
the research work conducted by the department of botany. 
Professor Egleston was emerited in 1897 and died in 1900. 
Professor Rood died in 1902. 
The purpose for which this Faculty was established, 
as President Low stated in his report of 1898, was to en- 
courage scientific research. For this purpose it was 
deemed advisable to unify the research interests of the 
different schools in the field of natural science. Naturally, 
therefore, as new research interests in this field were 
developed in the professional schools, the departments 
concerned obtained representation in the Faculty of Pure 
Science ; and new appointments in the field, whether in 
existing or in new departments, were in many cases made 
simultaneously in the Faculty of Pure Science and in 
the Faculties of Medicine or of Applied Science. Under 
these circumstances the Faculty of Pure Science grew 
rapidly in numbers. Within four years seats in Pure

Science were assigned to three more medical professors, 1890- 
George S. Huntington (anatomy), T. Mitchell Prudden ae 
(pathology), and Frederic S. Lee (physiology); seats in 
Pure and Applied Science to R. S. Woodward (mechanics), 
Harold Jacoby (astronomy), Bashford Dean (zoélogy), 
and Lucien M. Underwood (botany); and seats in Pure 
Science and in an undergraduate Faculty to Thomas 8. 
Fiske (mathematics) and Frank N. Cole (mathematics). 
Following the inclusion of the departments of anatomy, 
physiology, and bacteriology, the titles of Professors 
Osborn and Wilson were changed from professors of 
“biology” to professors of “zodlogy,” “biology” be- 
coming a divisional appellation. In the report already 
cited President Low said: “In connection with the School 
of Pure Science there has been no attempt made to define 
the point at which pure science stops and applied science 
begins; ” but the engineering departments and those of 
metallurgy and mining were not represented in the earlier 
organization of this Faculty. Professor Osborn resigned 
the Deanship in 1895, and Professor Woodward was 
elected as his successor. 
In 1892-1893 the School of Pure Science had a total en- 
rolment of 59 students: 87 College seniors, three graduates 
primarily registered in other schools, and 13 graduates 
and six special students primarily under its jurisdiction. 
In its third year, 1894-1895, the number of graduates 
primarily registered in the school was 26; 12 under- 
graduates in the Schools of Medicine and of Applied Science 
were pursuing some of its courses; the number of Col- 
lege seniors had decreased to 14, and the total enrolment 
was 66. The development of this school was retarded by 
the fact that for some years scientific first degrees were 
not accepted by the University Council as a basis for 
candidacy for the higher degrees. 
As the School of Political Science is related to the 
School of Law and the School of Philosophy to Teachers

   284 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1890- College, and both to the theological seminaries, so, in a 
   general way, is the School of Pure Science related to the 
Schools of Applied Science and of Medicine. These are 
its professional allies, and in these it fosters wider inter- 
ests and stimulates research. In the Schools of Applied 
Science, however, graduate work had been prosecuted 
and the degree of Ph.D. had been granted even before 
1880. After the Faculty of Pure Science was organ- 
ized, graduate work in the various branches of engineer- 
ing and in metallurgy and mining was still conducted by 
professors in the Faculty of Applied Science, and candi- 
dates who specialized in these branches were recommended 
for the doctorate by that Faculty. 
In the first decade of its separate existence (1893-1902) 
the Faculty of Pure Science promoted sixty-nine candidates 
to the doctorate. The fruits of active research appeared 
also in its publications. At the present time (1904) it 
maintains eight series of scientific studies: The Biological 
Series, Contributions from the Geological Department, Con- 
tributions from the Department of Mineralogy, Contributions 
From the Observatory, since 1892; Contributions From the 
Havemeyer Laboratories, since 1898; and three sets of 
botanical Memoirs and Contributions, the last established 
in 1895, besides a journal, the Bulletin of the Torrey Botan- 
ical Olub, founded in 1901. This list does not include 
the scientific publications which are under the direction primarily of members of the Faculties of Applied Science 
and of Medicine. 
The research work of the Faculty of Pure Science is greatly facilitated and enlarged by the relations (described 
1 Prior to 1880, 16 candidates received the degree of Ph.D. on recom- mendation of the Faculty of Applied Science (Mines). From 1880 to 1892, inclusive, the number was 28; from 1893 to 1904, 21. Until 1890 the Faculty recommended directly to the Trustees; after 1890 it recom- mended through the University Council. After the present year (1904) recommendations for the doctor’s degree in engineering, metallurgy, and mining will be made by the Faculty of Pure Science (see below).

in the preceding chapter) which the University has estab- 1890- 
lished with the New York Botanical Garden and with the 
American Museum of Natural History in New York. 
“The facilities thus afforded,’ Dean Woodward writes, 
“for studies in botany, geology, and paleontology are un- 
surpassed. Inthe mathematico-physical sciences also there 
is a similar codperation between our departments of mathe- 
matics, mechanics, and physics and the American Mathe- 
matical Society and the American Physical Society, which 
meet regularly at Columbia during the academic year.” 
By far the most interesting question which has thus far 
arisen in the development of the graduate schools has been 
that of the admission of women. The earlier arrangements 
made at Columbia or under its auspices for the higher 
education of women, first in the so-called “collegiate 
course for women ” (1883), and then in Barnard College, 
established as an independent institution in 1889, are 
described in the preceding chapter. The “collegiate 
course” was a system of examination without instruc- 
tion. In Barnard College separate instruction was given 
to women. Neither arrangement involved coeducation. 
The first difficulties in the working of these arrange- 
ments arose in connection with senior and graduate study, 
particularly after 1890, when the range of election in the 
senior year of the Columbia School of Arts (College) was 
greatly widened. No women had been registered in the 
“collegiate course” since 1889, but those who had been 
registered prior to that date were permitted to proceed 
as candidates for the degrees of A.B., A.M., and Ph.D. 
These women found increasing difficulty in passing 
examinations upon lecture courses which they could not 
attend. In Barnard College instruction was provided 
chiefly by duplication, the same courses being delivered, 
largely by the same instructors, at Columbia and at 
Barnard. It was evident, even before Barnard College 
   
-P-A-G-E-368
   1904 286 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1890- had a senior class, that it would be difficult to extend 
this system into the senior year, to say nothing of the 
graduate years. Assuming that the professors were willing 
to repeat their lectures (which was not true in all cases), 
Barnard College was not at that time able to pay for the 
duplication of so considerable a number of lecture courses, 
even at the customary lower rate. At the same time, 
Barnard College, under the sanction of the Columbia 
authorities, was promising to women a curriculum equiva- 
lent to that of Columbia; and the only way in which it could 
make that promise good was by securing the admission of 
its senior and graduate students to the courses delivered 
at Columbia. 
In his first report as Dean of the Faculty of Philosophy 
Professor Butler recommended that “auditors” be ad- 
mitted to university courses of instruction. Before the 
close of the academic year (1890-1891) the Trustees 
passed a statute providing that any course in the Fac- 
ulties of Political Science or Philosophy might be opened 
to “auditors” by authorization of the President with the 
consent of the professor concerned. Before the opening 
of the next academic year, each professor in these Faculties 
was informed, in a circular letter from the President, that 
women might be admitted as auditors. In 1891 a major- 
ity of the courses in the Faculty of Philosophy were thus 
opened to women. The problem, however, was not yet 
solved, even as regarded this Faculty. Under the stat- 
utes auditors were distinguished from regular students; 
they paid a fee one-third larger, and they were not 
candidates for a degree. This legal difficulty was met in 
a thoroughly judicial way by a distinction. All women 
properly qualified and registered as candidates for a degree 
at Barnard College were regular students in that College. 
They paid to Barnard College the regular fees for instruc- 
tion. For every such woman the Barnard corporation paid 
to the Columbia corporation the auditor’s fee. The women    
     
                                                            
   
-P-A-G-E-369
  
  THE GRADUATE SCHOOLS 287 
thus provided for attended lectures at Columbia as auditors, 1890- 
were examined as Barnard students, and received degrees 14 
on the recommendation of the Barnard College Faculty. 
At a meeting of the Faculty of Political Science in 
December, 1891, it was unanimously resolved that it 
was not desirable that any lectures should be opened to 
auditors without the authorization of the Faculty. Re- 
garding the expediency of admitting qualified women 
students, the Faculty, which at the time consisted of 
eight members, was divided in opinion ; but this question 
was not presented. The majority of the Faculty was 
opposed to opening university lectures to the general 
public, fearing that popular audiences would tend to elicit 
popular lectures; and the Faculty was unanimously of 
the opinion that so important a question of university 
policy as that of coeducation should not be decided by 
the action of the President and of individual professors. 
The statute authorizing the admission of auditors was 
not extended to apply to the School of Pure Science 
when that school was established in 1892. For several 
years, accordingly, women were not admitted to the 
senior or graduate courses conducted by the Faculties 
of Political Science and Pure Science. In 1895 the 
question of university coeducation was for the first 
time brought before the University Council. A motion 
was introduced that the Council should recommend that 
the courses conducted by the Faculties of Political 
Science and Pure Science in history, political economy, 
and mathematics (the subjects most needed by the senior 
and graduate students of Barnard College) should be 
opened to auditors. This motion, after full debate, was 
defeated. 
Shortly afterwards it was announced that a friend of 
Barnard College was prepared to establish in Columbia 
University, and to maintain for a term of years, three new 
professorships, — one in history, one in economics, and one
-P-A-G-E-370
  288 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1890- in mathematics, — on the understanding that each of these 
1904 departments should offer a corresponding amount of 
separate instruction to Barnard seniors and graduates; 
and that the Barnard corporation would endeavor to 
maintain these professorships after the expiration of 
such term. This proposal was approved by the Univer- 
sity Council and accepted by the Columbia Trustees. 
Professor James Harvey Robinson of the University of 
Pennsylvania and Professor John Bates Clark of Smith 
College were appointed to chairs respectively of history 
and of political economy in the Faculties of Political Sci- 
ence and of Barnard College; and Professor Frank N. Cole 
of the University of Michigan was appointed professor of 
mathematics in the Faculties of Pure Science and of Bar- 
nard College. It was arranged that these professors should 
lecture at Columbia as well as at Barnard, and that for 
every course given by them at Columbia, a course should 
be given at Barnard by their departmental associates. By 
this arrangement the Columbia Faculties were strength- 
ened, and the Barnard students obtained instruction not 
only from the newly appointed professors, but from several 
of their colleagues. Two years later it became known 
that the friend who had come to Barnard’s assistance at 
this critical moment was President Low. 
In 1897, the necessary authorization having been granted 
by the Trustees, thirty-seven courses in Pure Science were 
opened to auditors. In 1898 the Faculty of Political 
Science decided to open to women holding a first degree 
all purely graduate courses in history and economics, a 
purely graduate course signifying one that was not open 
to seniors in Columbia College. The number of courses 
thus opened has increased with the subsequent develop- 
ment of the school. In 1904 the list comprised twelve 
courses in history and fifteen courses in political economy 
and social science. 
When Barnard College was by formal agreement “ in-

  THE GRADUATE SCHOOLS 289 
corporated in the educational system of the University,” 1890- 
it was provided that women holding a first degree should 1° 
be admitted to graduate courses as regular students of the 
University. The fifth and sixth sections of the agreement 
of January 19, 1900, read : — 
“On and after July 1, 1904, all of the instruction for 
women leading to the degree of bachelor of arts shall be 
given separately in Barnard College, except that courses open 
to seniors of Columbia College which are counted towards a 
Teachers College diploma shall continue to be open to seniors 
in Barnard College. Barnard College will assume as rapidly 
as possible all of the instruction for women in the senior year, 
other than the courses leading towards a Teachers College 
diploma, without regard to the time limit contained in this 
section, and undertakes to maintain every professorship estab- 
lished at its instance, as hereinbefore provided, so long as 
the services of the incumbent thereof or an equivalent there- 
for shall be rendered in Barnard College; and when Barnard 
College has adequately provided for its undergraduate work, 
it will, as its means allow, establish additional professorships 
in the University, upon foundations providing for courses 
which shall be open to men and women, to the end that oppor- 
tunities for higher education may be enlarged for both men 
and women. 
“The University will accept women who have taken their 
first degree on the same terms as men, as students of the 
University, and as candidates for the degrees of master of 
arts and doctor of philosophy under the Faculties of Philoso- 
phy, Political Science, and Pure Science, in such courses as 
have been or may be designated by these Faculties, with the 
consent of those delivering the courses, and will make suitable 
provision for the oversight of such women.” 
Under this agreement, women holding a first degree 
ceased to be registered as students in Barnard College. 
In this same year (1900) two additional professorships 
were established in Columbia University upon Barnard 
College foundations. Professor William P. Trent of the 
University of the South was appointed professor of Eng- 
U

  290 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1890- lish literature, and Mortimer L. Earle, lecturer in Greek, 
was promoted to be professor of classical philology. To 
both were assigned seats in the Faculty of Philosophy. 
In 1891-1892, when courses in the Faculty of Philoso- 
phy were first opened to women, six women holding the 
first degree were admitted. In 1899-1900 the number 
had risen to 82, and in 1904 it was 181. In the latter 
year nearly 33 per cent of the students primarily regis- 
tered as candidates for the higher degrees, and more than 
83 per cent of all the students enrolled were women. 
“On the whole,” the Dean of the Faculty of Philosophy 
writes, “the results of admitting women have been good. 
Some of the best students have been women. Few of 
them proceed to the degree of Ph.D., but these few take 
the degree with high standing.” 
The proportion of women enrolled in the other graduate 
schools has not been so large. In 1903-1904 14 per cent 
of the students primarily registered in the School of Po- 
litical Science as candidates for the higher degrees, and 
10 per cent of all the students enrolled were women. In 
the same year the corresponding percentages in the School 
of Pure Science were 19 and 22. 
The number of real auditors, as distinguished from 
regular and special students, has not at any time been 
considerable in any of the graduate schools. Nearly all 
have been registered in the School of Philosophy, par- 
ticularly in the department of English; but even here the 
number has not exceeded twenty-eight in any recent 
year. The fear that the admission of auditors would tend 
to popularize the university lectures has, under these 
circumstances, proved groundless ; and when the admis- 
sion of auditors ceased to imply the admission of female 
auditors, the Faculty of Political Science voted that any 
of its courses might be opened to male auditors. 
The policy of the several graduate schools regarding 
the admission of non-graduate or special students has 
   
-P-A-G-E-375
  THE GRADUATE SCHOOLS 291 
varied greatly. The relations which the Faculty of Po- 1890- 
litical Science maintains with the Law School have given 
to the School of Political Science a large body of such 
students, particularly since 1891, when its courses in pub- 
lic law were made elective for the professional degree. 
In consequence of the requirement since 1903 of a first 
degree for admission to the Law School, these non-gradu- 
ate students will have disappeared by 1905. Other special 
students were never numerous, and since the adoption of 
stricter rules in 1900 there have been very few. Until 
1899 the School of Pure Science freely admitted non-gradu- 
ate students from the Schools of Medicine and of Applied 
Science ; in 1897-1898 it had on its rolls thirty-four such 
students, besides forty other special students. Since 1899 
it has followed the policy of excluding non-graduate 
students. The School of Philosophy admitted special 
students in increasing numbers until 1900, when its regis- 
tration included sixty-two non-graduates. Many of these 
were students in the department of music, which was 
connected with the School of Philosophy from 1896 until 
1902. At present, as the Dean of the Faculty writes, 
“only very unusual qualifications suffice to gain the 
privilege of admission as a special student.” 
Among other problems which have arisen in the de- 
velopment of the graduate schools, the conditions upon 
which the degree of Ph.D. should be awarded have been 
most debated. The statute of 1880, by which the School 
of Political Science was established, provided that young 
men who had completed three years of collegiate study 
should be admitted as regular students, and that such 
students might be recommended for the doctor’s degree 
after three additional years of residence. A statute of 
1882 provided that the doctor’s degree might be conferred 
after two years of study in the graduate department of 
the College. The statutes of 1890 and 1892, by which 
the Schools of Philosophy and of Pure Science were 190.
-P-A-G-E-376
  292 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1890- established, made the qualification for admission to these 
schools the completion of the third year of a college 
course. The University Council, invested with full 
power to determine the conditions on which the higher 
degrees should be awarded, accepted these precedents and 
fixed the minimum period of graduate study for the doc- 
tor’s degree at two years. As a matter of experience, 
however, it has been found that a longer period of study 
is usually necessary. The cases in which the degree of 
Ph.D. has been obtained in the minimum period have 
been very rare; the average period has been considerably 
in excess of three years. Under these circumstances 
there has been a demand that the minimum period of 
study for the doctorate after the attainment of the first 
degree should be raised to three years; but the University 
Council has thus far declined to make this change. 
The question is closely associated with the problem of 
shortening the aggregate term of college and university 
study. All the legislation above noted presupposes. that 
the fourth year of the College is really a university year, 
and that study for the doctor’s degree may begin in that 
year; and the Council has not been prepared to say that 
a student of exceptional ability and industry, who has 
pursued a coherent course of advanced study from the 
beginning of the senior year and has submitted a satis- 
factory dissertation shall not be permitted to obtain the 
doctorate within the present minimum term. 
The requirement that a candidate for the doctorate 
should be able to read Latin, as well as French and Ger- 
man, has been abolished as regards the Faculty of Pure 
Science, and it is waived as regards candidates in psy- 
chology, anthropology, and education when the professor 
in charge of their major subject certifies that knowledge 
of Latin is not necessary for the prosecution of their 
researches. 
The Faculties of Philosophy and of Pure Science adhere
-P-A-G-E-377
    THE GRADUATE SCHOOLS 293 
to the practice of the German universities in that no can- 1890- 
didate is admitted to examination for the doctorate unti 
an approved dissertation has been submitted. The Faculty 
of Political Science admits the candidate to examina- 
tion in his chosen field of study before his dissertation is 
submitted, in order that he may not be urged into hasty 
publication before his investigations are completed and 
his conclusions matured. The result of this practice is 
that many candidates do not submit completed disserta- 
tions until a year or more after the termination of aca- 
demic residence. In not a few cases the candidate, growing 
more critical of his own work, never completes a disserta- 
tion. It is the belief of the Faculty of Political Science 
that under this system the completed and printed dis- 
sertations are much more valuable than they would have 
been had the candidates been urged to earlier publication. 
In these and in other minor matters the University 
Council has wisely refrained from enforcing upon the 
several Faculties a uniform practice. In the present stage 
of University education it seems expedient that different 
methods should be tried until their relative worth is at 
least approximately determined. 
In 1902 the University Council established a committee 
on higher degrees, consisting of the representatives of the 
Faculties of Political Science, Philosophy, and Pure Sci- 
ence, and delegated to this committee a large part of its 
authority in matters relating to advanced non-professional 
study. This change has enabled the Council to devote 
more attention to those broader questions which concern 
the entire University; while the committee on higher 
degrees, meeting more frequently, is able to deal more 
promptly with questions which concern the graduate 
schools alone. 
The nine years from 1896 to 1904 inclusive were marked. 
by a further enlargement of the three non-professional 1 1904 
  
-P-A-G-E-378
   294 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
te Faculties and a rapid increase in the number of their 
   graduate students. 
Reénforced in 1895 by the appointments on Barnard 
foundations already noted, the Faculty of Political 
Science was further strengthened, in 1896, by the appoint- 
ment of Professor William Milligan Sloane of Princeton 
University, an alumnus of the old Columbia, to a newly 
established chair of history, which, in recognition of the 
President’s services to the University, was described as 
the Seth Low professorship. In 1901 the Faculty lost, 
by the second death in its ranks, another of its original 
members, Professor Mayo-Smith. At the time of his 
death, the department which he had built up was recog- 
nized as the strongest economic department in the coun- 
try, and the number of graduate students in economics 
was many times greater at Columbia than at any other 
American university. In his stead, Professor Henry R. 
Seager was called from the University of Pennsylvania 
and Professor Henry L. Moore from Smith College. 
It is interesting to note that this Faculty, in its brief 
history of twenty-four years, has grown, like the College 
on which it was grafted, first from within, by reproduc- 
tion, and then from without, by annexation. All the 
additions to the original teaching force, until 1891, were 
drawn from the graduates of the school; all reénforce- 
ments since that date have been drawn from outside, 
from the government service or from other colleges and 
universities. The earlier policy made the Faculty sin- 
gularly homogeneous; the later policy has kept it from 
becoming clannish. 
The opportunities for advanced study and research in 
history have been widened during the last few years by 
arrangements with members of the Faculty of Philoso- 
phy. Professors Gottheil, J: ackson, Prince, and Hirth were 
invited and cordially agreed to deliver courses on the 
history of the Arabs, of India and Persia, of western 
 
-P-A-G-E-379
  THE GRADUATE SCHOOLS 295 
Asia and Egypt, and of China. In connection with courses 1896- 
on Greek and Roman history delivered in the School of tous 
Political Science, these Oriental history courses enabled 
the Faculty, with the consent of the University Council, 
to announce that ancient history would be recognized as 
a major or minor subject for the master’s and doctor’s 
degrees. 
In 1894 the fruits of the fellowship system began to 
appear. In his report of that year Dean Burgess, for the 
first time, called attention to educational appointments 
conferred on recent graduates of the school: five profes- 
sorships, an instructorship, and one lectureship. From 
that date, annual or biennial lists of such appointments 
became a permanent feature in the Dean’s reports; and 
as the lists lengthened, they became also a topic of com- 
ment in the President’s reports. The effect upon the stu- 
dent body showed itself clearly in 1900, when the primary 
registration in the school (men only) rose to 132. From 
1890 to 1894 inclusive the average primary registration} 
was 28; from 1895 to 1899 inclusive, it was 81. In 1908 
both primary registration and total enrolment reached 
their highest point: 157 and 523. 
The growth of the Faculty and of the School of Phi- 
losophy has been even more rapid, especially since this 
school and Teachers College became neighbors. Since 
1895,? besides the two appointments on Barnard founda- 
tions already noted, seats in the Faculty have been 
assigned to eight Teachers College professors: James E. 
Russell (education), Frank M. McMurry (theory and 
practice of teaching), Paul Monroe (history of education), 
Samuel T. Dutton (school administration), Julius Sachs 
(secondary education), Franklin T. Baker (English), 
Gonzalez Lodge (Latin and Greek), and Edward L.

1896- Thorndike (psychology). During the same period seven 
professors have been appointed to chairs in this Faculty 
and in an undergraduate Faculty: Calvin Thomas 
(German), Carlo L. Speranza (Italian), Nelson G. 
McCrea (Latin), Clarence H. Young (Greek), Living- 
ston Farrand (anthropology), Frederick J. E. Woodbridge 
(philosophy), and Charles Knapp (classical philology) ; 
and six professors have been added to the Faculty of 
Philosophy exclusively: Franz Boas (anthropology), 
John D. Prince (Semitic languages), Friedrich Hirth 
(Chinese), Felix Adler (ethics), Charles A. Strong 
(psychology), and Marshall H. Saville (American arche- 
ology). Edward A. MacDowell (music) was a member of 
the Faculty from his appointment in 1896 until his depart- 
ment was set off from the School of Philosophy in 1902. 
Between 1896 and 1904 the Faculty lost two other mem- 
bers: one, James H. Hyslop, by resignation; the other, 
Thomas Randolph Price, by death. 
In 1902, when Dean Butler became President of the 
University, Professor Perry was elected as Dean of 
the Faculty of Philosophy. 
From 1896 to 1904 inclusive, the total registration in 
the School of Philosophy rose from 227 (including Col- 
lege seniors) to 495 (exclusive of undergraduates); and 
the primary registration from 130 to 481. In the total 
and primary registration for 1904 were included 100 stu- 
dents primarily registered in Teachers College who were 
candidates for the higher degrees under the Faculty of 
Philosophy, and 21 auditors. 
The Faculty and School of Pure Science also owe a por- 
tion of their recent growth to the neighboring federated 
colleges. The appointment of one professor on a Barnard 
foundation has already been noted. More recently seats 
in the Faculty of Pure Science have been assigned to four 
Teachers College professors: John F. Woodhull (phys- 
ical science), Richard E. Dodge (geography), Francis E.  
-P-A-G-E-381
THE GRADUATE SCHOOLS 297 
Lloyd (biology), and David E. Smith (mathematics). 1896- 
Since 1900 seats in the Faculties of Pure and Applied De 
Science have been assigned to James Maclay and Cassius 
J. Keyser (mathematics), Edmund H. Miller, Marston T. 
Bogert and J. L. R. Morgan (chemistry), and Amadeus 
W. Grabau (geology) ; in Pure Science and in the Bar- 
nard College Faculty to Henry E. Crampton (zodlogy). 
Further representation has been given to the Medical 
School by adding to the Faculty of Pure Science William 
J. Gies (physiological chemistry) and Philip H. Hiss (bac- 
teriology). Additions have been made to this Faculty 
exclusively by the appointments of Ernest F. Nichols 
(experimental physics) and Gary N. Calkins (zodlogy). 
A further enlargement of this Faculty is in prospect. 
During the year 1903-1904 the Faculties of Applied 
Science and of Pure Science unanimously resolved to 
recommend to the Trustees that all graduate work in 
science for the higher degrees should be conducted under 
the direction of the Faculty of Pure Science. This in- 
volves the assignment of seats in the latter Faculty to the 
heads of the departments of civil and sanitary engineering, 
electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, mining, and 
metallurgy. ‘The change is one which Dean Woodward 
has long sought to accomplish. ‘The terms ‘applied 
science’ and ‘pure science,’” he writes, “inevitably sug- 
gested invidious distinctions. Applied science must have 
its research side; otherwise it ceases to be progressive. 
The Faculty of Mines and its successor, the Faculty of 
Applied Science, have had authority to conduct work for 
the higher degrees. That work has been intimately con- 
nected with the work of the Faculty of Pure Science. 
Time has fortunately removed objections to a unification 
of the graduate work of the two Faculties.” 
The student body in Pure Science grew steadily during 
the years 1896-1904. After 1896, by resolution of the 
University Council, students holding scientific first degrees 
 
-P-A-G-E-382
   298 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1896- were admitted as candidates for the higher degrees. In 
   the year preceding this legislation, 1895-1896, the number 
of graduates primarily registered in pure science was 28, 
and the total enrolment was 85. In the following years 
there was a gradual increase in the number of graduates 
primarily registered in this school, and also in the number 
of graduates primarily registered in Medicine and Applied 
Science who were enrolled under the Faculty of Pure 
Science as candidates for the higher degrees. The num- 
ber of graduates primarily registered rose from 28 in 
1895-1896 to 65 in 1899-1900 and 102 in 1903-1904. 
The total number of graduates registered rose from 86 in 
1895-1896 to 156 in 1903-1904. 
The fact that the graduate schools have begun to re- 
ceive endowments from gifts and bequests is at once an 
indication of the success which they have achieved and a 
warrant of their further development. In 1898 the Cham- 
ber of Commerce of the State of New York raised by pub- 
lic subscription the sum of $100,000, to perpetuate the 
memory of George E. Waring. The income of this fund, 
primarily destined to the use of Colonel Waring’s widow 
and daughter, is ultimately to be devoted to “ instruction 
in municipal affairs.” In 1901 an “ anonymous friend ” 
gave $213,000 to found a department of Chinese lan- 
guages, literatures, religion, and law, and especially for 
the establishment of a professorship to be known as the 
Dean Lung professorship of Chinese. In 1903 Joseph F. 
Loubat gave $100,000 to establish the Loubat professor- 
ship in American archeology. In the same year a legacy 
of $100,000 was received from the late Dorman B. Eaton 
to endow and maintain a professorship of municipal sci- 
ence and administration. 
The following fellowships have been established by gift 
or bequest: the George William Curtis fellowship in 
political science; the Schiff fellowship in political science; 
the Tyndall fellowship for the encouragement of research

and literature.

other hand, these statistics include students in other 1904 
professional schools who were simultaneously pursuing 
courses in the non-professional Faculties as candidates 
for the higher degrees, viz.: students in Teachers College 
and in the theological seminaries of New York City and 
its environs. There is, of course, no educational basis for 
any such distinction. It rests on the fact that Teachers 
College and the theological seminaries are financially 
independent institutions. 
The following table, compiled at the writer’s request by 
the Registrar of the University, attempts to give a more 
scientific analysis of the body of students who attended 
courses under these three Faculties in 1903-1904. It 
separates graduate students who were candidates for the 
higher degrees from those students, graduate or non- 
graduate, who were not candidates for such degrees. It 
separates the candidates who were not studying in any 
professional school from those who were simultaneously 
pursuing professional and non-professional courses, includ- 
ing in this latter category the students primarily registered 
in Teachers College or in a theological seminary as well as 
the other professional students. It shows, finally, in the 
third column, the extent to which students having their 
major subject in one non-professional Faculty elect minor 
subjects in another.

   304 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
There were, accordingly, 791 graduate students regis- 
tered under the three Faculties as candidates for a de- 
gree; and it would seem that it might fairly be claimed 
that all these students belonged to the graduate schools. 
If, however, all students simultaneously pursuing profes- 
sional studies are to be eliminated, the number of graduates 
primarily registered in the graduate schools in the year 
1903-04 was 481; and, if the 21 special students primarily 
registered under the three Faculties in that year and 
their 23 auditors be added, the primary registration was 
525. 
Besides the students above enumerated, there appeared 
on the rolls of the School of Political Science, in 1903- 
1904, students of the Law School to the number of 153 
who were pursuing courses offered by the Faculty of 
Political Science (chiefly in public law and comparative 
jurisprudence) as a part of their legal education, and not 
as candidates for the non-professional degrees. This body 
of students represents the realization of one of the chief 
purposes for which the School of Political Science was 
established —the broadening of legal study. Many of 
these students were attracted to Columbia by the oppor- 
tunities which it offers for the study of public law and 
comparative jurisprudence, but all of them are neces- 
sarily regarded as owing primary allegiance to the pro- 
fessional school. 
Under the narrowest system of reckoning, the three 
graduate schools of Columbia have grown to be the 
strongest non-professional graduate department in the 
United States. This result is partly due to Columbia’s 
metropolitan situation ; partly to the liberal policy pur- 
sued by the Trustees, especially during the administration 
of President Low; partly to a university organization 
which has thus far proved itself sufficiently centralized 
to maintain unity in essentials and sufficiently flexible to 
adapt itself to varying conditions ; and partly to the fact,

recently noted by the Dean of the Faculty of Philosophy, 1904 
that Columbia has not developed so large an undergrad- 
uate college as to constrain its teachers to adapt their 
advanced courses to the needs and capacity of undergrad- 
uate students. In the last instance, however, the success 
of the graduate schools has been due to the ability and 
fidelity of their teachers and the zeal of their students ; 
for neither by situation nor by money nor by machinery 
is a university made, but by men.

   BOOK THREE 
     THE PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS 
        
  I.—THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE 
THE beginnings of professional education in America 
are found, not within institutions of learning, but in the 
familiar personal association of the student with the pro- 
fessional man. Whether in theology, law, or medicine, 
the system was essentially the same. The future clergy- 
man learned his theology and the art of preaching in the 
clergyman’s library and before his pulpit ; the law student 
was trained in the lawyer’s office, and at the courts under 
the lawyer’s eye ; while the prospective physician read 
text-books, recorded cases, and compounded drugs in the 
office of the physician, and accompanied the latter on his 
daily round of visits. This relation of the younger and 
the older man was a survival in the new world of the 
system of apprenticeships which had prevailed so long in 
Great Britain in both law and medicine, and which even 
now has not entirely disappeared. Sometimes it fell well- 
nigh to the level of a rigorous slavery ; more often it 
formed the foundation of a mutually helpful and con- 
tinuing friendship. There was much in the method to 
be commended, and though in present days, when the 
demands of professional training are tremendous, it has largely died away, we still find the young graduate seek- 
ing the intimate personal counsel of the leader in his 
specialty.

  308 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
In medicine the relation of student to preceptor was 
early recognized by law and was regarded as essential to 
the existing methods of instruction; but the individual 
training was supplemented by private lectures and recita- 
tions on specified branches, given by the preceptor to small 
classes. Anatomy was a favorite topic of such special 
courses, and was often accompanied by demonstrative dis- 
sections. Thus, as early as 1647, the Apostle John Eliot 
wrote: “We never had but one Anatomy in the Countrey 
which Mr. Giles Firman . . . did make and read upon very 
well.” In 1750 Dr. John Bard and Dr. Peter Middleton 
dissected the body of an executed criminal in New York 
City “for the instruction of the young men then engaged 
in the study of medicine.” But such instances were 
isolated. Mr. Eliot wrote with regret that “our young 
students in Physick . . . have onely theoreticall knowl- 
edge and are forced to fall to practice before ever they saw 
an Anatomy made, or duely trained up in making experi- 
ments.” And he early recognized that “it were a singu- 
lar good work, if the Lord would stirre up the hearts of 
some or other of His people in England to give some main- 
tenance toward some Schoole or Collegiate exercise this 
way, wherein there should be Anatomies and other in- 
structions that way.” Most American youths who had 
higher ambition in medicine than that which could be 
satisfied through training obtained in their preceptor’s 
company and through chance autopsies, were forced to go 
to the universities of Europe ; and thus Edinburgh, Aber- 
deen, Glasgow, London, Leyden, Paris, and Padua gave 
the instruction that was lacking at home. 
Soon after its foundation the governors of King’s Col- 
lege realized the need of which Mr. Eliot had written 
more than a century before, and in 1763 a course of 
lectures on anatomy was given at the College by Dr. 
Samuel Clossy, a graduate of Trinity College, Dublin, an 
enthusiastic anatomist and an excellent physician and 
   
-P-A-G-E-395

surgeon. Four years later Dr. Clossy and five other phy- 1767 
sicians laid before the governors a proposal to institute a 
medical school within the College, and offered to give a 
course of lectures in the most necessary branches of medi- 
cine. After due consideration and a decision that the 
establishment proposed would tend to the honor and 
reputation of the College and would be a benefit to society, 
the Board voted, on August 14, 1767, to establish the 
medical school, and to appoint the six physicians as the 
first medical professors. By this action, King’s College 
founded the second school of medicine to be inaugurated 
in the new world, one hundred and thirty years after the 
arrival of the first physician who settled permanently in the 
city of New York, and only two years after the founding 
of the medical school of the College of Philadelphia, the 
forerunner of the University of Pennsylvania. The school 
opened in November of the same year with the following 
staff, representing for the time an unusually generous 
amount of specialization: Samuel Clossy, Professor of 
Anatomy; Peter Middleton, Professor of Physiology and 
Pathology ; John Jones, Professor of Surgery; James 
Smith, Professor of Chemistry and the Materia Medica; 
Samuel Bard, Professor of the Theory and Practice of 
Physic ; and John V. B. Tennent, Professor of Midwifery. 
Sooner or later all of these men won high rank in their 
profession. Dr. Bard became the most eminent. A former 
student in arts of King’s College, and a graduate in medi- 
cine of Edinburgh University, he brought to the new world 
and ably promulgated the views of the celebrated William 
Cullen, Professor of Medicine at Edinburgh, regarding the 
nature of disease. He became the physician of George 
Washington; was instrumental in founding the New York 
Hospital and the New York Dispensary; became in 1791 
dean of the medical faculty of Columbia College, and in 
18183 president of the College of Physicians and Surgeons ; 
and was associated with American medical education in

1767 these various capacities for many years. Dr. Jones had 
been a pupil of the famous surgeons, Pott and William 
Hunter, of London, and Petit, le Cat, and le Dran of 
Paris. He was the leading surgeon of his day in America. 
He attended professionally both George Washington and 
Benjamin Franklin, and like his master, le Cat, became 
celebrated for his lithotomies. In 1775 he published 
“Plain, Precise, Practical Remarks on the Treatment of 
Wounds and Fractures,” which was the first book on a 
medical subject to appear in the new world. Dr. Smith 
was a graduate of Leyden, and Dr. Tennent of Edinburgh. 
The New York Mercury of November 9, 1767, contains 
the following quaint account of the opening of the 
school : — 
“ At the Opening of the Medical School in King’s Col- 
lege, in this City: 
“On Monday Forenoon last Week, the Governors, 
President, Tutors and Professors of the College, as- 
sembled at the Vestry Room in this City, from whence, 
being honoured with the Company of his Excellency the 
Governor, the Judges of the Supreme Court in their 
Robes, and the Gentlemen of the Law in their Gowns, 
they walked in Procession to the College Hall, where 
they were entertained with a very elegant and learned 
Discourse, by Doctor MippLEton, Professor of the Theory 
of Physic, on the Antiquity, Progress and Usefulness of 
that Science. The Satisfaction of the learned and splendid 
Audience on this Occasion was universal, and more es- 
pecially so, when they considered the Performance as the 
Beginning of an Institution, so replete with Advantages 
to Mankind in General, and to the inhabitants of this 
Province in particular. 
“In the Evening of the same Day, was delivered by 
Dr. Cuossy, Professor of Anatomy, an introductory Lec- 
ture to that important Science, which for genuine Learn- 
ing and Precision, was justly applauded. 
“The Day following, Dr. Smrru, Professor of Chymistry, 
gave an introductory Lecture on that Branch, which for 
Elegance and Sublimity, met with universal Approbation.

“On Wednesday, Dr. BARD, Junior, Professor of the 1767 
Practice of Physic, delivered his introductory Discourse, 
which for Masterly Composition and genteel Delivery, 
was highly pleasing to the respectable Audience. And 
“On this day, at five o’Clock in the Afternoon, the in- 
troductory Lecture on Surgery will be given by Dr. JoNEs, 
Professor of that Science. 
“The general Approbation which this Institution hath 
hitherto met with, on Account of its great Utility to Man- 
kind, we hope will sufficiently recommend it to the At- 
tention of such as intend the Practice of Physic, especially 
in this City and Colony. By a constant Application to 
Study under the Direction of the above Gentlemen Pro- 
fessors (if regularly prepared to attend them) young 
Gentlemen may in a few Years be intitled to and obtain 
the Honours of the Medical Profession, and thereby be 
qualified to enter legally upon the Practice of Physic ; 
with singular Advantage to the respective Communities 
to which they belong.” 
The following excerpts from the announcement of the 
first session of the school indicate its standard and how 
closely it was modelled upon the universities of Great 
Britain : — 
“1. Each Student shall be matriculated as in the 
Universities of England. 
“2. Such Students as have not taken a Degree in Arts 
shall satisfy the Examiners, before their Admission to a 
Degree in Physic, that they have a compleat knowledge of, 
at least, the Latin Language and of the necessary Branches 
of Natural Philosophy. 
“3. No Student shall be admitted to his Examination 
for a Bachelor's Degree, in less than three years after his 
matriculation, and having attended at least one com- 
pleat Course of Lectures under each Professor ; unless he 
can produce proper Certificates of his having served an 
Apprenticeship of Three Years, to some reputable Practi- 
tioner, in which Case he may be admitted to his Exami- 
nation in Zwo Years from his Matriculation. 
“4, In one Year after having obtained a Bachelor’s De- 
gree, a student may be admitted to his Examination for

1792 the Degree of Doctor, provided he shall have previously 
attended two Courses of Lectures under each Professor, 
be of Twenty-two Years of Age, and have Published, and 
publickly defended, a Treatise upon some Medical Subject. 
“5. The Mode of Examination, both publick and 
private, shall be conformable to the Practice of the most 
Celebrated Universities of Europe.” 
It is seen from the above that it was contemplated to 
give, as in England, the degrees of both bachelor and doctor 
of medicine. The first baccalaureates were conferred upon 
Robert Tucker and Samuel Kissam in 1769, and the first 
doctorates upon the same individuals in 1770 and 1771 
respectively. King’s College thus antedated all other 
colleges in America in conferring the degree of doctor of 
medicine in course. By the year 1774 nine other indi- 
viduals had received the baccalaureate, and this degree 
was not given thereafter. 
When, early in the war of the revolution, King’s 
College was closed, the work of the medical school also 
ceased, and it remained in abeyance throughout the war. 
On the reopening of the College under the name of 
Columbia in 1784 a new medical faculty was appointed. 
But little seems to have been done in the years immediately 
following the war, and it was not until 1792 that a com- 
plete reorganization was effected and instruction was 
resumed under a competent faculty of nine, with the 
eminent Dr. Bard as dean and the sole representative of 
the original faculty. Success, however, was not thus 
assured, and though the work of teaching was continued 
for the succeeding twenty-one years, the number of stu- 
dents was small, and the school did not occupy a leading 
position. During this time only twenty-four students were 
graduated. Meanwhile the College of Physicians and Sur- 
geons had been organized, and in 1813 the medical school of 
Columbia was discontinued and its faculty was transferred 
to its newer and more successful rival. From that time 
 
-P-A-G-E-399
  THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE 313 
until, in 1860, the College of Physicians and Surgeons 1807 
in turn came under the egis of Columbia, no medical 
instruction was undertaken in the latter institution. 
In the last decade of the eighteenth, and the first of the 
nineteenth century, along with the growth of New York 
as a social and industrial metropolis, the city rapidly 
became an important medical centre. The New York 
Hospital, the Lying-in Hospital, the New York Dispen- 
sary, the Medical Repository, the first medical journal 
for the publication of original articles to appear in 
America, and the Medical Society of the County of New 
York, were established. Private medical instruction was 
carried on, even so far as to lead to the establishment of 
private schools; but the need of a well-organized and 
well-equipped college was constantly felt. This need 
became so strong that in 1807 the newly organized and 
active Medical Society of the County of New York, which 
already possessed the power of examining students and 
granting licenses for the practice of medicine, memorial- 
ized both the Legislature and the Regents of the Univer- 
sity of the State, praying for incorporation as a College. 
A charter, dated March 12, 1807, was promptly granted 
by the Regents, establishing in the city of New York the 
“College of Physicians and Surgeons,” “for the promo- 
tion of medical science and diffusing the knowledge of the 
healing art.” 
The first faculty was as follows: Nicholas Romayne, 
President, and Lecturer on Anatomy; Samuel L. Mitchill, 
Vice-president, and Professor of Chemistry; Edward 
Miller, Professor of the Practice of Physic and Lecturer 
jn Clinical Medicine ; David Hosack, Professor of Materia 
Medica and Botany, and Lecturer on Surgery and Mid- 
wifery; Archibald Bruce, Registrar, and Professor of 
Mineralogy ; Benjamin De Witt, Professor of the Insti- 
tutes of Medicine, and Lecturer on Chemistry; John 
Augustine Smith, Adjunct Lecturer on Anatomy. These
-P-A-G-E-400

1807 men represented much of the best in the medical and 
scientific circles of the day. Dr. Romayne, to whose 
efforts the inauguration of the College was largely due, 
was a graduate in medicine of Edinburgh, and had studied 
in Paris and Leyden. He had been a professor of medi- 
cine in Queen’s (now Rutgers) College, and a professor 
of physic, anatomy, and chemistry in Columbia. Dr. 
Mitchill was distinguished for his breadth of learning. 
For nineteen years he was a professor in Columbia. With 
Drs. Miller and Elihu H. Smith, in 1797, he helped to 
found and edit the pioneer of American medical journals, 
the Medical Repository, and he added much to medical 
literature. For many years he served as a physician at 
the New York Hospital. In addition to his activities in 
medicine he became prominent in public life as a repre- 
sentative and a senator in Congress, and in various other 
capacities. Dr. Hosack, who had graduated in medicine 
at Edinburgh, was a celebrated botanist, and active in 
both scientific and medical affairs. Freeing himself from 
medical traditions, he was original and courageous in 
pathological conceptions and methods of treatment. Dr. 
Bruce was also a medical graduate of Edinburgh, and an 
enthusiastic scientist. Dr. Smith had been a student of 
medicine in London, and was a member of the Royal 
College of Surgeons. He was at one time president of 
William and Mary College. He served in the College of 
Physicians and Surgeons in various professorial capacities 
for twenty-four years, and in 1831 became also its presi- 
dent. Under such men, each eager and enthusiastic in 
his work, the College assumed at its outset an elevated 
professional tone and a strong earnestness of purpose 
which it has ever since maintained. Its doors opened 
auspiciously in November, 1807, with fifty-three students, 
in a house in Robinson Street, now Park Place. During 
the presidency of Dr. Romayne the number of students 
gradually increased, and the College became established
-P-A-G-E-401
THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE 315 
on a firm educational and a safe financial basis. Though 1818 
threatened for a time by internal dissensions, it was im- 
proved by a reorganization by the Regents, and its future 
became assured. The annual course was of four months’ 
duration, lasting from the first day of November until the 
first day of March, and was supplemented by certain 
optional lectures in zodlogy, botany, chemistry, and min- 
eralogy during the spring months. At least two years 
of study were expected before graduation, but the first 
class did not complete its course until 1811, when degrees 
were conferred upon eight candidates. 
The administration of Dr. Samuel Bard, the second 
president, continued from 1811 until his death in 1821. 
The event of first importance during this period was the 
absorption, in 1813, of the medical faculty of Columbia 
College, a union which more than doubled in number, and 
greatly increased in strength and prestige the teaching 
body of the school. Among the acquisitions from Colum- 
bia were Wright Post, Joint Professor (with Dr. Smith) 
of Anatomy, Physiology, and Surgery; and Valentine 
Mott, Professor of the Principles and Practice of Surgery ; 
while at about the same time John W. Francis became 
Professor of Materia Medica. Dr. Post had studied under 
distinguished masters in London, and he vied with the 
English surgeons in the brilliancy, courage, and success 
of his operations. Dr. Mott had been a pupil of the cele- 
brated Sir Astley Cooper in London, and of the famous 
teachers of Edinburgh. He became without question the 
leading surgeon of his time in America, while his emi- 
nence was recognized in Europe by his election to member- 
ship in the French Institute and the prominent medical 
bodies of London, Brussels, and Paris. His skill and suc- 
cess in the performance of major operations were phenom- 
enal, and his professional life was a long and constantly 
busy one, forming an epoch in the history of American 
surgery. Dr. Francis was one of the first graduates of 
 
-P-A-G-E-402
   316 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1826 the College. He possessed valuable professional and 
   social connections in this country and abroad, became the 
leading general practitioner of the city, and added much 
of value to medical literature. During this period the 
College removed from Magazine (now Pearl) Street, 
where it had been situated since its brief occupancy of 
the house in Robinson Street, to new quarters in Barclay 
Street, which with subsequent additions served as its 
home for twenty-four years. Here the number of its 
students rapidly increased and soon surpassed two hun- 
dred, drawn from all parts of the United States. It now 
acquired possession of the botanical garden of Dr. Hosack, 
situated three miles to the north and comprising the tract 
of land now bounded by 47th and 51st streets and Fifth 
and Sixth avenues. This was intended to serve as a 
valuable aid in the study of materia medica, but it proved 
a disappointing venture, and relief was felt when the 
garden was transferred to Columbia College. 
The successor of Dr. Bard in the presidency was 
Wright Post, who served from 1822 to 1826. Through 
no fault of his, these were years of dissension, resulting 
largely from the criticism of professional rivals outside 
the college circle; and though the work of the College 
went steadily on, the controversies were only ended in 
1826 by the summary resignation of the entire faculty. 
Some of these, notably Dr. Mott, returned to the service 
of the institution in later years. 
The fourth president was John Watts, a graduate of 
Edinburgh, and a leading practitioner. Prominent among 
those newly called to become instructors were John 
Torrey, in chemistry and botany ; John B. Beck, in bot- 
any and materia medica, and later in medical jurispru- 
dence; Alexander H. Stevens, in the principles and 
practice of surgery; Edward Delafield, in obstetrics and 
diseases of women and children; and Joseph M. Smith, in 
the theory and practice of physic, and clinical medicine, 
 
-P-A-G-E-403
    THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE 31T 
—to the last of whom the College was indebted for forty 1837 
years of continuous service. Dr. Torrey, who served the 
College for nearly thirty years, represented the best type 
of the scientific man of his day. He was the friend of 
Asa Gray, and was one of the founders of American 
science. Dr. Beck was a forceful and influential con- 
tributor to medical literature. Dr. Stevens, who had 
been a student of John Abernethy and Sir Astley Cooper 
in London, and Larrey and Boyer in Paris, became emi- 
nent asa surgeon. He was for twenty-two years a visit- 
ing surgeon at the New York Hospital, retained his 
professorship for eleven years, later became president of 
the College, and throughout his long and honored life 
was constantly active in the service of humanity and of 
his profession. Dr. Delafield had also been a pupil of 
Abernethy and Sir Astley Cooper. He became a leading 
practitioner, and for many years labored zealously and 
ably in the interests of the College. With a firm presi- 
dent, an able faculty, and devoted trustees, the institution, 
within a few years, largely recovered from the untoward 
results of the previous discord, and entered upon a long 
period of prosperity and growth. 
In 1831 the scholarly John Augustine Smith succeeded 
to the presidency, and his administration lasted twelve 
years. Pressed on by the northward growth of the city, 
the College was removed in 1837 to a commodious and 
well-appointed building in Crosby Street. Optional 
spring and autumn courses were inaugurated to supple- 
ment those of the regular winter session. The faculty 
was notably enriched by the appointment of three men, 
none of whom served the College less than a quarter of 
a century, and who, as warm friends, were a unit in seek- 
ing and maintaining for the institution a commanding 
place in American medical education. These were Rob- 
ert Watts, in anatomy and physiology, Willard Parker, 
in surgery, and Chandler R. Gilman, in obstetrics and 
  
-P-A-G-E-404
   318 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1855 diseases of women and children. Dr. Parker’s career of 
   thirty years was especially distinguished by the main- 
tenance of progressive ideals, great strength of character, 
and preéminent leadership. It was directly due to his 
foresight and enterprise that clinical instruction was 
inaugurated at the College building as supplementary to 
bedside instruction in the hospitals. This feature has 
ever since existed. 
Alexander H. Stevens was president from 1843 to 1855, 
a period of constant prosperity. The regular curricu- 
lum was now lengthened from four to four and a half 
months. An important addition to the teaching facilities 
was the chair of physiology and pathology, later changed 
to pathology and practical medicine, its incumbent being 
Alonzo Clark. Dr. Clark had had exceptional oppor- 
tunities for the study of pathology and other branches 
of medicine in London and Paris, and his lectures were 
regarded as models. The College enjoyed his distin- 
guished services for thirty-seven years, first as professor and 
later as president. Another event of importance was the 
coming, to occupy a chair of physiology and microscopic 
anatomy, of John C. Dalton, only a few years before 
fresh from the laboratory of Claude Bernard, the eminent 
French physiologist. Dr. Dalton may rightly be re- 
garded as having introduced into America the experi- 
mental method in physiology. He ultimately became 
Dr. Clark’s successor in the presidency. 
Upon Dr. Stevens’s resignation in 1855, Thomas Cock, 
long the honored vice-president, was elected president, 
and though, because of advancing age, he served for only 
three years, it was during this period that the College, 
the location of which had been encroached upon by com- 
mercial buildings, advanced still farther northward, and 
began a new period of expansion on 23d Street at Fourth 
Avenue. 
The eighth president, from 1858 until 1875, was Ed- 
 
-P-A-G-E-405
THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE 319 
ward Delafield, and under him the College was enabled 1860 
to take an important step for which its long growth had 
prepared it. This was the alliance with Columbia Col- 
lege. It was preceded by a severance, by mutual consent 
and legislative action, of the relations which the College 
had had from the first with the Regents of the University 
of the State. This placed in the hands of the trustees 
for the first time the important powers of granting de- 
grees and of appointing their own officers. The alliance 
with Columbia, which was formally ratified in June, 1860, 
while conferring honor upon both institutions, was scarcely 
more than a nominal one. Each institution retained its 
own autonomy, continued to hold its own property and 
to manage its own financial affairs, and was in all essen- 
tial respects independent of the other. The diplomas of 
the medical graduates were to be signed, however, by the 
two presidents respectively, and the degrees were to be 
“publicly conferred by the president of the College of 
Physicians and Surgeons, sitting with the president of 
Columbia College.” The College of Physicians and 
Surgeons, while retaining its own title, was thereafter 
known officially as the “ Medical Department of Columbia 
College.” Columbia thus took under her mantle the 
institution in whose interests in 1813 she had sacrificed 
her own medical faculty, and she acquired in turn a pro- 
fessional school of rank and dignity. The alliance was 
the foreshadowing of the closer union which was to come 
thirty years later, when Columbia was being rapidly 
transformed from a college into a university. 
The removal of the College to its new quarters in 
23d Street gave opportunity for expansion, and this 
soon began, especially in the direction of practical in- 
struction. Within a few years the number of clinics 
held at the College was more than trebled, and the title 
of clinical professor was established and conferred upon 
several individuals. Instruction in the various special 
 
-P-A-G-E-406
820 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1875 branches of medicine was gradually inaugurated, and the 
facilities for demonstrative teaching in anatomy, physi- 
ology, and chemistry were much increased. The curricu- 
lum was lengthened from four and one-half to five months. 
During the civil war a course of lectures on military sur- 
gery was given by William Detmold. At the close of the 
war the roll of students rapidly lengthened and amounted 
in 1866 to four hundred and sixty-five. Upon the death 
of Dr. Gilman in 1865, the chair of obstetrics was occu- 
pied by T. Gaillard Thomas, who was called thence from 
the New York University. In this position, and subse- 
quently as professor of gynecology, Dr. Thomas gave to 
the College the prestige derived from his eminence as a 
practitioner. In 1860 Thomas M. Markoe became the 
adjunct professor of surgery, and in 1870 he was advanced 
to the professorship as the worthy successor of Dr. Parker. 
Upon the death of Dr. Delafield in 1875, Alonzo Clark 
was called to the presidency, and he remained the honored 
head of the College for nine years. The years following 
his accession were made notable by the successful comple- 
tion of a project of the Alumni Association to establish 
a laboratory for purposes of instruction, especially in 
pathology. The sum of $10,000 was raised, a portion of 
which was expended for an immediate equipment, while 
the rest was invested as a fund for continued maintenance. 
The laboratory was established in 1878, and Dr. Francis 
Delafield, then adjunct professor of pathology and practi- 
cal medicine, was made its director. This was the first 
step made by the College toward providing laboratory 
facilities for the students, and is hence of special historic 
interest. That the project should have been inaugurated 
in reference to one of the important sciences on which 
medicine is based demonstrates the enlightened sympathy 
of the alumni toward a broad medical education. 
The annual course had now been lengthened from five 
to seven and a half months, the teaching body had be- 
 
-P-A-G-E-407
    THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE 821 
come greatly enlarged by the appointment of many active 1884 
young men, the number of students had surpassed five 
hundred, and the resources of the College were taxed to 
the utmost. Further growth under the existing con- 
ditions was impossible. In 1884 Dr. Clark retired from 
the presidency. His successor was John C. Dalton, the 
five years of whose incumbency witnessed momentous 
events. These were the acquirement of the present 
site in West 59th Street; the erection of buildings 
surpassing, at the time, those of any other medical school 
in the United States, in spaciousness and adaptability 
to their uses; the removal of the College to its new 
site; and an extension of its work beyond all previous 
records. ‘These events were made possible through the 
generosity of Mr. William Henry Vanderbilt and his 
children. Mr. Vanderbilt’s gift was of the value of 
$500,000, of which sum he had expended $200,000 for the 
land, leaving $300,000 for building purposes, which was ul- 
timately used for the erection of the main college building. 
A little later Mr. and Mrs. William D. Sloane proposed to 
erect and maintain the Sloane Maternity Hospital, to be 
under the immediate direction of the professor of obstet- 
rics, and to afford free obstetrical service and opportunity 
for practical instruction. The four sons of Mr. Vander- 
bilt presented the sum of $250,000 for a third building, 
—the Vanderbilt Clinic, —which was to serve asa free 
dispensary and home for the college clinics. The prep- 
aration of suitable plans and the erection of the three 
buildings proceeded without unnecessary delay, much 
thought being expended in adapting the buildings to the 
demands of the several departments, especially in the 
providing of laboratories and other facilities for practical 
instruction. The main building was completed and 
formally dedicated on September 29, 1887, immediately 
after which the work of the regular session began. The 
dedication of the Sloane Maternity Hospital and the Van- 
Y    
-P-A-G-E-408
   322 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1887 derbilt Clinic occurred on December 29 of the same year. 
   By subsequent liberal gifts from the Messrs. Vanderbilt 
and Mr. and Mrs. Sloane, an adjoining parcel of land was 
purchased which allowed the erection of an anatomical 
institute ; larger and more numerous laboratories were 
added to the main building ; the Clinic was doubled in 
size; and the Maternity Hospital was enlarged and more 
than doubled in capacity. The new buildings gave oppor- 
tunity for expansion in all departments; the course was 
lengthened to eight and one-half months; and a third 
year of study was added to the two years which had 
existed from the first, a change which led to the disap- 
pearance of the time-honored system of the student’s 
apprenticeship to a preceptor. The teaching staff was 
necessarily augmented in number; former courses were 
elaborated and perfected, and new courses were inaugu- 
rated. Demonstrative teaching was made more prominent 
than ever before. Practical work in laboratories and 
clinics was greatly augmented and made obligatory for 
all students. Apparatus, instruments, models, demonstra- 
tion and museum specimens, and all that constitutes the 
material outfit of a well-equipped medical school were 
provided. The college was thus enabled to take a posi- 
tion of Teaecdutp in the medical world which it had never 
before held. _ 
Throughout its history the College of Physicians and 
Surgeons has held the warm interest and support of its Alumni. Among early benefactors were Dr. John Mc- 
Clelland, a a of the Class of 1838; Dr. J. Carney 
Rogers and Professor John B. Beck. The Association of 
the Alumni was formed in 1859 and was incorporated in 
1873. Through its efforts a fund of $6,000 was raised, 
which, supplemented by a bequest from Mr. Benjamin 
Cartwright, enabled the association to establish two prizes of $500 each, awarded on the basis of competitive 
essays and in alternate years. The Alumni Association

prize is open to Alumni of the College only. The Cart- 1889 
wright prize is open to the medical profession at large. 
The Association contributed directly to a most important 
advance in medical education, by providing in 1877 a sum 
of money amounting to $10,000, which, upon the advice 
of Dr. Francis Delafield, was designated as a Laboratory 
Fund and formed the beginning of the present laboratory 
facilities in pathology, bacteriology, and histology. In 
1883 Mr. James T. Swift presented the sum of $10,000 
to purchase and maintain an outfit of physiological appa- 
ratus in memory of his brother, Dr. Foster Swift, of the 
Class of 1857. Other gifts are the Stevens Triennial 
Prize Fund, established by President Stevens ; the Alonzo 
Clark Scholarship, the Joseph Mather Smith Prize, the 
Proudfit Fellowship, and the Harsen gift, the income of 
which, after having been applied for forty-five years to 
prizes for clinical reports and for proficiency in examina- 
tions, is now to be devoted to the support of scholarships 
in medicine for the degree of Doctor of Medicine. Dr. 
Jacob Harsen, the donor of the Harsen gift, was a gradu- 
ate of Columbia College in the Class of 1825, and of the 
College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1829. 
The death of Dr. Dalton occurred eighteen months after 
the removal of the College, and Dr. James W. McLane, 
then professor of obstetrics, to whose individual efforts 
the opportunities for expansion were largely due, was 
elected, in 1889, the twelfth president. Two years later 
the culminating action was taken which was to place the 
College on an academic basis befitting its professional 
status. Like most of the American medical schools, the 
College of Physicians and Surgeons, although organized 
under the auspices of the Medical Society of the County 
of New York and under the jurisdiction of the Regents 
of the University of the State, had been from the first a 
proprietary institution. As such it had achieved its 
dignity, its honor, and its professional standing; and its 
 
-P-A-G-E-412
   1891 constitution 
Columbia Co.     324 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
te not been altered by its alliance with 
lege. But a proprietary school can never 
acquire the prestige and the permanence in the learned 
world which are possible for a school forming a part of 
a great university. Columbia, under the enlightened 
leadership of 
that was dest 
versity ; and Mr. Low, was undergoing the transformation 
ned to result in the making of a great uni- 
it was only natural that the thought of a 
fusion of the two institutions should arise within both. 
Suggestion was followed by early action. Deliberations 
and vals ou over the details of the merger were held at 
intervals thro 
1891, the fin ghout more than a year, and in November, 
1 step was taken which joined the two for- 
ever and inseparably, the College of Physicians and Sur- 
geons transferring its property to the trustees of Columbia 
College, and becoming an integral part of the latter. 
President Low wrote at the time: “The union thus 
begun throu 
through cons h division in 1814 has become permanent 
lidation in 1891.” 
To enumerate the multitudinous evidences of progress 
since the union would require space far beyond the limits 
of this chapt vr. An important step was taken in 1894 
when a fourth year was added to the curriculum, thus 
quadrupling within a period of fifty years the time de- 
manded of the student. In 1898 a department of physi- 
ological chemistry, with adequate and well-equipped lab- 
oratories, was inaugurated under the direction of Russell 
H. Chittenden. The teaching staff has more than doubled, 
and now surpasses two hundred. A further evidence of 
progress is t e opening of certain courses in anatomy, 
physiology, physiological chemistry, and bacteriology to

ing which has resulted from the union. The College has 1904 
felt the dignity and responsibility associated with its 
academic rank. High ideals have always been its posses- 
sion, but now they have become so in an added degree. 
It has been spurred on to greater achievements by contact 
with the other schools of the University, and by a realiza- 
tion of the true university spirit. A university aims, not 
merely to transmit, but to augment knowledge, and this 
aim permeates the present School of Medicine. Its lab- 
oratories and its clinics are not simply places for instruc- 
tion, but have become important centres of research ; not 
only are future practitioners there educated, but future 
investigators are nurtured, and the scientific medicine of 
to-morrow will gain from the broad spirit of scientific 
inquiry which animates the College of to-day. 
The foregoing brief account of the rise and growth of 
medical instruction in the School of Medicine is intention- 
ally confined to a recital of a few of the most striking facts 
in its history. Notwithstanding the vicissitudes of title 
and administrative control, throughout the one hundred and 
thirty-seven years of its existence this instruction, under 
the successive names of King’s College, Columbia College, 
the College of Physicians and Surgeons, again Columbia 
College, and lastly Columbia University, may be regarded 
as constituting a logical entity. Just as Columbia is the 
historic university of the city of New York, so its medical 
college, under whatever name, is the city’s historic school 
of medicine. It will prove of interest to consider the 
historical relations of certain of the branches of medicine 
as they have been developed within this school. 
To the popular mind a medical school suggests first the 
idea of dissection, and from early times anatomy has 
rightly been regarded as the most fundamental of the 
medical sciences. Though its work has been hampered 
by popular prejudice and superstition, and though in the    
-P-A-G-E-414
   826 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1788 early days it was often necessary to secure bodies for dis- 
   section surreptitiously and illegally, it has persevered 
until its scientific status has been recognized by law. In 
the School of Medicine of Columbia a professorship of 
anatomy has existed from the beginning. In the anatom- 
ical instruction, in addition to the lectures and demon- 
strations, dissection has constituted the chief method. 
In the time of Dr. Clossy and his successors, the oppor- 
tunities for dissection were meagre, and the work was car- 
ried on under difficulties and even dangers. The famous 
Doctors’ Riot of 1788, which resulted in the killing of 
several persons, was incited by the discovery of a portion 
of a human body in a window of the New York Hospital, 
and was the demonstration of a fanatical mob against the 
hospital, Columbia College, the houses of several phy- 
sicians, and the jail in which the physicians had been 
placed for safe-keeping. In the following year the legis- 
lature of New York passed the first American law designed 
to regulate the practice of anatomy. This allowed the 
bodies of executed murderers, incendiaries, and burglars, 
to be given by the court to surgeons for dissection “in 
order that science may not . . . be injured by preventing 
the dissection of proper subjects.” This gave some relief, 
but anatomical material, legally obtained, was not abun- 
dant. The entry in the College accounts of 1807 of the 
sum of $136.95, “To Cash, paid Dr. Smith, for anatomi- 
cal Purposes,” if given in detail, would doubtless reveal 
tales of midnight adventures. An enactment in 1847 
allowed the College to use the unclaimed bodies of con- 
victs dying in the State prison at Sing Sing; but it was 
not, until the passage of the more liberal Public Health 
Law of 1854 that the supply of bodies became ample, and 
rendered unnecessary the forcible methods which had 
hitherto obtained. Practical anatomy was made compul- 
sory for all students in 1878. Since, in 1792, Dr. Wright 
Post brought to Columbia his anatomical cabinet, acquired 
 
-P-A-G-E-415
THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE 827 
in Europe, the College has rarely been without a museum ; 1895 
but none bears comparison with the splendid collection 
illustrating human and comparative morphology which 
has been made in recent years through the personal efforts 
of Professor Huntington, and which is designed “to pre- 
sent, in as complete a manner as possible, a view of the 
evolution of the forms of animal life and of their natural 
relations.” The first laboratory of anatomy, apart from 
the dissecting room, was opened in 1887. The building 
of the Anatomical Institute in 1895 was an epoch in the 
history of the department, since it gave greatly increased 
space and facilities for work in all directions. A variety 
of courses is now offered, and there is every opportunity 
for investigation. 
The year of the inauguration of medical work in Colum- 
bia College succeeded that in which appeared the final 
volume of the “ Hlementa physiologie corporis humani” 
of Haller, the distinguished physiologist of Germany and 
Switzerland, and the discoverer of the independent irrita- 
bility of muscle and of nerve. His book marks the divid- 
ing line between the physiology of olden and that of 
modern times. Beginning with Haller, the College has 
witnessed the rise of the modern experimental science 
with its ingenious methods, the death of the dogma of 
vital force, and the origin and potent growth in influence 
of the cell doctrine, of the idea of protoplasm as the phys- 
ical basis of life, and of the theory of evolution. The 
early American teachers of physiology were disciples of 
Haller, as were those of Europe, and his “ Prime linee 
physiologic,” in its English version, served as a text-book 
in this country until well into the nineteenth century. At 
times under the title of “physiology,” at times under that 
of “institutes of medicine,” the subject was taught in the 
College by means of lectures and text-books, and usually 
as an adjunct to another subject, until the coming, in 1854, 
of Dr. Dalton, in point of time the first experimental physi-   
      
 
-P-A-G-E-416
   328 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1854 ologist of America. Dalton brought to this country the 
  enthusiasm and investigating spirit of his great master, 
Claude Bernard, who, when his pupil once said to him, 
“T think it must be so,” had replied, “Think! Why 
think, when you can experiment?” Dalton did not en- 
gage in medical practice, but gave his time completely to 
the work of instruction and investigation, and his teach- 
ing, illustrated constantly by experimental demonstrations, 
aroused enthusiasm. As he had brought the spirit of the 
best French science, so his pupil and successor, John G. 
Curtis, introduced that of Ludwig and the Germans, and 
the department has ever since felt the influence of these two 
potent schools. The opening of the College at its present 
site in 1887 allowed the installation for the first time of 
adequate physiological laboratories, which were provided 
with an unusually ample outfit of apparatus through the 
agency of the Foster Swift Memorial Fund, established a 
few years before, and still existing, for the purchase of the 
“more expensive, delicate, and complicated instruments 
and appliances, mainly instruments of precision, requisite 
for the pursuit of physiological science.” Since then re- 
search has been constantly carried on, and the publications 
of the laboratories are well known in this country and 
abroad. Besides demonstrative teaching for the students 
of medicine, courses leading to the graduate degrees in the 
School of Pure Science have, for the last decade, been a 
feature of the physiological work, and during the past year 
an extensive course of practical work in the laboratory 
has become obligatory as a part of the course leading to 
the degree of doctor of medicine. 
The first teachers of chemistry in Columbia were doubt- 
less under the influence of Stahl’s phlogistic notions, for it 
was not until 1774 that Priestley made his immortal discoy- 
ery of oxygen. But the modern chemistry had hardly begun 
to appear on the continent of Europe, before it crossed the 
ocean and was taught to the students of medicine in New     
-P-A-G-E-417
    THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE 829 
York. Dr. Samuel Mitchill was early announced in print 1898- 
as adopting the “ Anti-Phlogistic System,” and he himself 
claimed that he “taught the reformed chemistry of the 
French and unfurled the banner of Lavoisier sooner . . . 
than any other professor in the United States.” From the 
beginning of the medical school to the present time there 
has been an unbroken line of practical chemists and chem- 
ical instruction. Even the early lectures were illustrated 
by demonstrations, which, however pyrotechnic and ex- 
plosive they may have been, were still an advance upon 
mere didactic instruction, and it would appear that a 
chemical laboratory for the preparation of such demon- 
strations existed from the first. Practical work in chem- 
istry was possible for the students after 1862, but it was 
not compulsory until the removal of the College to its 
present site. A long forward stride was taken in 1898, 
when in view of the rapid rise of physiological chemistry 
as a distinct science, a separate department in that subject, 
with fully equipped laboratories, was established under the 
directorship of Professor Chittenden. 
In the eighteenth century, systems and theories were 
abundant in medicine, and pathology was distinctly spec- 
ulative. Boerhaave with his “enormon,” Stahl with his 
“anima,” Hoffmann with his “ether,” Cullen with his 
“nervous principle,” and Brown with his “irritations,” 
all held sway, and their systems extended on into the suc- 
ceeding century. The early medicine of America was 
naturally influenced by these men. In the third and 
fourth decades of the nineteenth century there flourished 
in Paris a prominent and influential school of pathological 
anatomists. Dr. Alonzo Clark, who visited Paris after 
his graduation from the College of Physicians and Sur- 
geons, came under the influence of some of these, such 
as Chomel, Cruveilhier, Andral, and Louis, and when he 
returned home he came as their enthusiastic disciple and 
the advocate of the new pathology. Armed with his micro-

1878 scope he joined the staff of instructors of the College in 1847 as the occupant of the newly created chair of physi- ology and pathology. Up to that time pathology had been treated mainly as adjunct to one or another branch of medicine, but thereafter it was recognized as deserving individual consideration. The modern cellular pathology may be said to have arisen when Virchow in 1858 an- nounced his dictum, “omnis cellula e cellula,” and applied 
the cell doctrine to pathological tissues and processes. 
Francis Delafield, the successor of Dr. Clark in the chair 
of pathology, had been a pupil of Virchow, and his in- sistence upon the necessity of practical work led to the establishment of the pathological laboratory by the Alumni Association in 1878. This was a timely event. Two years before, Koch, studying the bacillus of an- thrax, had made the first conclusive demonstration of the production of a specific human disease by a specific bacte- rium; and the new and revolutionary science of bacteriol- 
ogy was in the throes of its birth, Moreover, pathology, hitherto morphological, was becoming also experimental. 
The far-reaching results of the action of the alumni are now seen in the extensive laboratories of pathology, bacte- riology, and histology, which, under Professor Prudden’s guidance, have grown from the original seed, and which afford abundant opportunities for instruction and research. Practical work in these three subjects was made obligatory for all students of medicine immediately after the removal of the College to its present site. 
The time-honored term “ materia medica,” coupled with “chemistry,” “botany,” « mineralogy,” “institutes of medicine,” “ medical jurisprudence,” “ clinical medicine,” 
or “therapeutics,” gave a title to a professor’s chair in the College until 1903. In accordance with the growing importance of the study of the physiological action of drugs by exact experimental methods, it has now given place to the more timely title of pharmacology, and the 
    
-P-A-G-E-419
THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE 331 
change has carried with it the establishment of student 1802 
laboratories of pharmacology and pharmacy. 
The chair of practice of medicine, the focal point of 
medical instruction, has also continued from the begin- 
ning, and has reflected the continual changes in medical 
practice. During the century and a quarter of its exist- 
ence, systems and theories have died away, and empiricism 
has fallen back before the advance of scientific rationalism 
in prevention and treatment. In this advance the Colum- 
bia School of Medicine has had no inconsiderable share. 
The same is strikingly true of the development of surgery. 
Our first surgeons studied at the Edinburgh school, with 
Pott and the two Hunters in London, and with le Cat, 
Petit, and le Dran in Paris. Later the influence of 
John Abernethy and Sir Astley Cooper of London, and of 
Boyer, Larrey, and Dupuytren of Paris became potent. 
But while our countrymen have learned valuable lessons 
at the foreign schools, their native ingenuity, dexterity, 
and boldness have not been restrained by foreign conven- 
tions, and have won for our national surgery a position of 
supremacy. Not least prominent in the American advance 
has been the long and honorable line of surgeons of the 
Columbia school, — Jones, Post, Mott, Stevens, Parker, 
Markoe, Sands, McBurney, Weir, and Bull. The first in- 
struction undertaken by the College in both medicine and 
surgery was by means of lectures only. But before the 
close of the eighteenth century the establishment of the 
New York Hospital afforded clinical opportunities at the 
bedside, and they have never since been wanting. Early 
in the following century Valentine Mott introduced the 
method of performing the chief surgical operations on the 
cadaver before the students. Clinics for both medical and 
surgical cases have been held at the college buildings since 
1841, and during the past year a laboratory for surgical 
research has been established. 
Of the more specific branches of medicine only one, — 
 
-P-A-G-E-420
   332 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1887 obstetrics, at first called midwifery,—has had its repre- 
   sentative on the faculty of the College continually since the latter part of the eighteenth century, and it has 
usually been combined with that of the diseases of women 
and of children. In recent years three departments have 
taken the place of the one, each with its staff of instructors. 
In the early years of the past century the students were 
allowed to visit the Lying-in Hospital and the Lying-in 
ward of the Almshouse, and at least since 1853 a small 
amount of practical work in obstetrics has been possible 
for all students. But the opening of the Sloane Maternity 
Hospital in 1887 gave the long-desired opportunity to 
offer adequate practical instruction to both graduates and 
undergraduates. Instruction in other specific branches 
began between the years 1841 and 1866 in the optional 
summer courses which were then multiplying in connec- 
tion with the growth of the College clinics, and from the summer courses these branches were gradually introduced 
into the curriculum of the regular session. 
Columbia College early recognized the importance of hospitals in connection with medical instruction. The first incumbent of the chair of practice, the distinguished 
Samuel Bard, in his address at the first commencement of 
the school in 1769, took occasion to urge the desirability 
of establishing a hospital in the city. The Governor, Sir Henry Moore, received the idea warmly, and a subscription 
for the purpose was begun on the same day. Upon the petition of Drs. Bard, Middleton, and Jones, Lieutenant- 
governor Colden granted in 1771 a charter for the establishment of the New York Hospital. Owing to the destruction of the first building by fire and the on-coming 
of the war of the revolution, the hospital was not com- pleted and opened for patients until 1791. The medical 
faculty of Columbia again took the initiative in recom- 
mending the formation of atlibrary in connection with 
the hospital, and they contributed for this purpose both 
 
-P-A-G-E-421
THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE 333 
books and money. ‘The early records show that the 1904 
students of the College were allowed to attend the hospital 
practice. On the opening of the College of Physicians 
and Surgeons, similar arrangements were made for the 
students of that institution under Dr. Miller, then pro- 
fessor of practice. Since then the College and hospital 
have always had intimate clinical relations. Dr. Mac- 
neyen’s practice at the Almshouse in Chambers Street was 
also open to the students in 1807. The removal of the 
Almshouse to Bellevue in 1816, and the simultaneous 
establishment of its hospital, do not seem to have carried 
with them special clinical facilities, but the latter were 
secured by the reorganization of the institution in 1849. 
From the beginning of the century the Lying-in Hospital 
also afforded certain privileges for study. New York and 
Bellevue were the important hospitals of the city during 
the first half of the century. In the period of the civil 
war and the years immediately following it, numerous 
hospitals were built,and clinical opportunities for students 
increased correspondingly. At present the College gives 
instruction in eleven of the more important hospitals, and 
cases occupying more than two thousand beds are acces- 
sible to the students. For years an important feature of 
the clinical instruction has been that which is afforded by ° 
the clinics in the College buildings, where patients whose 
condition allows them to leave their homes are treated in 
the presence of the students. Established in 1841 as a 
general medical and surgical clinic, they were gradually 
increased in number by successive additions in special 
branches until, in 1876, ten clinics were in operation, 
providing opportunities for students to observe, diagnose, 
and prescribe. The building of the Vanderbilt Clinic and 
its subsequent enlargement gave at last an adequate home 
for this feature of the College work and opportunity for its 
continued extension. These clinics are visited annually 
by nearly fifty thousand patients, who present a wide

1904 range of disease and afford unusual privileges for study. 
   The third and fourth years of the curriculum are now chiefly devoted to clinical work either at the College or in the hospitals. 
In the history of the School of Medicine the fact is 
prominent that in educational matters the institution has 
been a conservative leader. It has been ready to adopt 
new ideas and methods when once they have been proved 
efficient, but it has avoided the new that is of uncertain 
value. Its influence upon other schools has been potent, 
but it has been content to let others try disastrous educa- tional experiments. Its heritage from the old world has been great, but it has not been shackled by medical tradi- 
tion, and it has lived to instruct the old-world teachers. 
It has avoided sensationalism, and upheld sound medical 
doctrine. Conspicuous in the annals of education and medical progress, to the world at large it has proved a mighty force. The ancient oath of Hippocrates, to which all who go from its walls subscribe, adjures each “by whatever he holds most sacred,” to “be loyal to the pro- 
fession of medicine,” and to practice his art “ in upright- 
ness and honor,” and this oath they have kept. In times of pestilence their courage has not failed. In military and * naval service they have upheld their country’s honor and the good name of their school. They have seen the old medicine pass away, and their enlightened efforts have helped to bring in the new. The honorable past of the College is already achieved, and under the inspiration of the University a still more honorable future is assured.

    IIl.—THE SCHOOL OF LAW 
In his famous speech for Conciliation with the Colonies, 
Burke named as one of the six capital sources of the fierce 
spirit of liberty, which characterized the colonists, the 
general diffusion of legal knowledge. “In no country 
perhaps in the world,” he declared, “ is the law so general 
a study.” In support of this statement he referred to the 
great number of lawyers among the deputies sent to the 
Continental Congress ; to the fact that the colonists were 
printing law-books for their own use and that as many of 
Blackstone’s Commentaries had been sold in America as in 
England, and cited General Gage’s assertion “ that all the 
people in his government are lawyers, or smatterers in 
law.” It was this widespread study of the law, in Burke’s 
opinion, which made the colonists so “ acute, inquisitive, 
dexterous, prompt in attack, ready in defence, full of 
resources,” which led them to “augur misgovernment at 
a distance, and snuff the approach of tyranny in every 
tainted breeze.” 
It is not strange, therefore, that King’s College, founded 
as it was when this taste for legal study was becoming 
prevalent, should have been the first institution of learning 
in America to establish a professorship of law. This was 
done in 1773, and from that date until the College was 
closed by the Revolutionary War, John Vardill, A.M., 
occupied the chair. 
1 The doubts which have been expressed about Mr. Vardill’s having 
entered upon the duties of this office are dispelled by a letter written by 
him from King’s College, in September, 1773, to George Washington 
concerning the latter’s stepson, John Parke Custis. Undoubtedly, Mr. 
Vardill left New York for England before the College was closed in 1776. 
335    
-P-A-G-E-426
   336 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1784 No sooner had King’s College been reorganized and re- 
   christened as Columbia, than her Trustees voted to establish 
a law school, with three professorships, viz. : “A professor- 
ship in the Law of Nature and Nations, a professorship 
in the Roman Civil Law, a professorship in the Municipal 
Law.” This action was taken on December 14, 1784, 
and bears witness to the broad views and high ideals of 
the Columbia Trustees of that day. But it is not sur- 
prising that such views and ideas were entertained by a 
board whose leaders were John Jay and Alexander Hamil- 
ton. Unfortunately, however, Columbia’s finances were 
then at a low ebb, and the ambitious project of a law school 
with three professors was not carried out, although the 
idea of providing for legal instruction was still cherished. 
The financial condition of the College was greatly im- 
proved in 1792 by a grant from the state of various sums 
in partial reparation of losses sustained during the war, 
and of the further sum of £750 annually for five years, “to 
be applied to the payment of the salaries of additional pro- 
fessors.” It was now possible for the Trustees to do some- 
thing for legal instruction. Accordingly, a professorship 
of law was established in 1793, and James Kent, A.M., was 
unanimously elected to fill the chair, at an annual salary of 
£200. It was not an extraordinary stipend, to be sure, but 
it should be remembered that the incumbent was a young 
and struggling lawyer, and that it was supposed the per- 
quisites of the position would equal the salary. Moreover, 
the duties of the professorship were not engrossing, and the 
appointment, he wrote his brother, “will even aid my 
professional practice at the bar,” and prove “not only 
honorable but profitable.” 
He entered upon the preparation of his lectures with 
much enthusiasm, reading in the original, by way of spe- 
cial equipment, “ Bynkershoeck, Quintilian, and Cicero’s 
rhetorical works, besides English reports and digests.” 
That the course was not intended primarily for professional 
 
-P-A-G-E-427
  
  THE SCHOOL OF LAW 337 
students appears from the prospectus contained in a pam- 1794 
phlet published in 1794, entitled “ The State of Learning in 
the College of New York.” At that time the College em- 
braced two faculties — the Faculty of Arts and the Faculty 
of Physic, and the prospectus referred to appears in the 
sketch of the first of these faculties. It is as follows: — - 
“Mr. Kent, having been so recently appointed, has not 
as yet entered upon a course of lectures; but this pro- 
fessorship is intended to comprise a brief review of the 
history, the nature, the several forms, and the just ends of 
civil government —a sketch of the origin, progress, and 
final settlement of the United States —a particular detail 
of the organization and duties of the several departments 
of the general government, together with an examination of 
such parts of the civil and criminal codes of the federal 
jurisprudence, as shall be the most susceptible of illus- 
tration and most conducive to public utility. The courts 
of the several states and the connection they bear to the 
general government will then be considered, and the more 
particular examination of the Constitution of this State. 
The whole detail of our municipal law, with relation to 
the rights of property, and of persons, and the forms of 
administering justice, both civil and criminal, will then be 
treated fully and at large.” 
The opening lecture of the course was delivered No- 
vember 17, 1794, and was published in pamphlet form by 
the college Trustees for private distribution.1 It was well 
received, not only by those who listened to its delivery, 
but by the far larger body of its readers. Of the latter 
class was John Adams, then Vice-president of the United 
States, who wrote to his son Charles Adams, “I am much 
pleased with the lecture, and esteem the talents and char- 
acter of the Professor.” Some idea of the spirit with 
which the young professor entered upon the course may 
be formed from the following extracts from the opening 
and closing paragraphs of the lecture : “This is the first

Law Review, Vol. Ill, p. 380.

instance in the annals of this seat of learning that the 
science of Municipal Laws has thus been admitted into 
friendship with her sister arts and been invited to lend 
her aid to complete a course of public education. . . . 
If he to whom is intrusted in this seat of learning, the 
cultivation of our laws, can have any effect in elevating 
the attention of some of our youth from the narrow and 
selfish objects of the profession, to the nobler study of the 
general principles of our governments, and the policy of 
our laws ; If he can, in any degree, illustrate their rea- 
son, their wisdom, and their propitious influence on the 
freedom, order, and happiness of society, and thereby pro- 
duce a more general interest in their support, he will deem 
it a happy consolation for his labors.” 
The course consisted of twenty-six lectures, extending, 
as he wrote his brother on March 1, 1795, “not only 
through the Constitution and jurisprudence of the Union, 
the Constitution of this and the other states, but our 
doctrine of real property. My first plan was to examine 
the law of personal property, including the commercial 
branches, and the system of our criminal code. But I 
found myself absolutely unable to complete the whole, 
and was obliged to leave this first course imperfect. It 
will be an easy thing to make these additions and review 
and improve the whole by next November. I am satisfied 
that my lectures have been well received and that my 
expectations are answered.” Upon the fly-leaf of his own 
copy of the opening lecture, he noted that he “ was honored 
by the attendance throughout the course of seven students 
and thirty-six gentlemen, chiefly lawyers and law students 
who did not belong to the college.” In the same memo- 
randum he notes that “during my second course, com- 
mencing November, 1795, I read thirty-one lectures, in my 
office, and had only two students besides my clerk.” The 
following year no students presented themselves for the 
course, and on May 2, 1797, he tendered his resignation.
-P-A-G-E-429
THE SCHOOL OF LAW 339 
It was not accepted, however, until April, 1798, and this 1828 
final action appears to have been taken, not because the 
Trustees shared the dissatisfaction with the performance 
of his duties which the professor had expressed in his 
letter of resignation, but because he had been appointed a 
judge of the Supreme Court. 
In the letter of resignation he refers to the fact that in 
the early part of the second season he published the three 
preliminary lectures, together with a summary of the entire 
course, in order that the public might become acquainted 
with the details of his plan. While this publication did 
not draw students, it did give the author a reputation 
abroad, and was cited as an authority in Brown’s “ Treatise 
on Civil and Admiralty Law,” published shortly afterward 
in England. This is believed to be the first citation ever 
made of an American law-book by an English author. 
After Kent’s retirement from Columbia, the professor- 
ship of law was unoccupied until 1823, when he was 
reappointed to the chair, after his retirement from the 
office of chancellor, at the age of sixty — that being the age 
limit fixed by the Constitution to the Chancellor’s term of 
office. Some years afterward he wrote Thomas Washing- 
ton: “The trustees of Columbia College immediately ten- 
dered me again my old office of Professor, which had lain 
dormant from 1795. I undertook (but exceedingly against 
my inclination) to write and deliver law lectures.” Per- 
haps this reluctance was due in part to the fact that his 
former lectures had not attracted more students, and in part 
to his estimate of those lectures. We have seen that he 
expressed satisfaction with them at the conclusion of the 
first season, but later he recorded in his memoranda: “I 
have long since discovered them to have been slight and 
trashy productions ; I wanted judicial labors to teach me 
precision.” The unfortunate fate of his first course was 
not exceptional ; it was shared by courses given in other 
parts of the country about that time, by men of great ex-

1824 perience and distinguished reputation. Associate Justice 
Wilson of the United States Supreme Court became pro- 
fessor of law in the College of Philadelphia in 1790, but 
was unable to carry on his work successfully after the first 
year. At Harvard Justice Parker, of the State Supreme 
Court, met with no greater encouragement, when he en- 
tered upon the duties of Law Lecturer. 
The second attempt at legal instruction in Columbia was 
productive of remarkable results, although they were of a 
kind not contemplated either by the Trustees or by Chan- 
cellor Kent. 
However reluctant he may have been to take up again 
the work which he had laid aside in a mood of disappoint- 
ment twenty-six years before, he soon became thoroughly 
interested in it. Early in January, 1824, he wrote to his 
brother, “I have for two or three weeks engaged with 
great zeal in preparing law lectures.” A fortnight later 
he writes: “I have got eight to ten lectures written out and 
mean to begin the first of February, and shall deliver but 
two formal lectures a week, with one more private for the 
matriculated students only. By this means I can keep up 
two lectures a week until June, and that shall be the 
extent of my first imperfect and broken course.” In 
November of the same year, he entered upon a longer and 
fuller course, although in a letter of the 9th of that month 
he intimates that he is still engaged in preparing new lec- 
tures, which give him a good deal of trouble and anxiety 
and compel him to study and write all the time. He con- 
tinued to discharge the duties of law professor until the 
spring of 1826, when, as he wrote in 1828, “having got 
heartily tired of lecturing, I abandoned it.” Perhaps the 
success which attended the publication of the first volume 
of his Commentaries, and the labor required for the prep- 
aration of the later volumes, account for his withdrawal 
from academic work. Certainly, there is nothing to indi- 
cate a lack of appreciation either by students or by the 
 
-P-A-G-E-431
THE SCHOOL OF LAW 341 
College authorities. In the preface to the first volume, the 1826 
author writes: “In the performance of my collegiate duty, 
I had the satisfaction to meet a collection of interesting 
young gentlemen of fine talents and pure character, who 
placed themselves under my instruction, and in whose wel- 
fare a deep interest is felt. Having been encouraged to 
suppose that the publication of the lectures might render 
them more extensively useful, I have been induced to sub- 
mit the present volume to the notice of students, and of the 
junior members of the profession, for whose use they were 
originally compiled. Another volume is wanting to em- 
brace all the material parts of the lectures which have 
been composed.” He soon found, however, that his plan 
could not be completed within the limits of two volumes. 
A third volume was published in 1828 and a fourth in 1830. 
And so it came about that Columbia’s first and most 
famous professor of law was not the founder of a law 
school, but the author of a legal classic. It is true the 
name of James Kent, LL.D., was carried in Columbia 
catalogues as the professor of law, and that he continued 
the incumbent of the professorship until his death in 
1847. But his name served only to give lustre to the 
faculty list. No work was done and no emoluments were 
received by him as occupant of the chair of law after 
1826. Still, Columbia claims, and rightfully claims, a 
share in the fame of Kent’s Commentaries. Undoubtedly, 
it was her institution of a law professorship, and her early 
and abiding faith in James Kent as the most suitable man 
for the place, that induced him to undertake their prepa- 
ration. Her sons have a right to feel a peculiar pride 
in them as an expansion of lectures delivered upon her 
foundation and under her immediate auspices ; and to 
rejoice in the fact, as stated in Abram S. Hewitt’s terse 
encomium, that they “have had a deeper and more last- 
ing influence in the formation of national character than 
any other secular book of the century.”

   842 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1857 In 1848 William Betts, a graduate of Columbia in the class of 1820, a trustee of the College and a distinguished member of the New York bar, was chosen to the profes- sorship made vacant by Chancellor Kent’s death. He delivered a few lectures, but they were given as a labor of love to his alma mater, and were spasmodic and intermit- tent, as such labors of love generally are. After his resignation in 1854, the professorship was vacant for some years. During this period the financial resources of the College had been largely increased, and the Trustees felt the time had come when they could safely attempt to provide for the study of law as a part of a university course. Their original plan, as set forth in a College statute of 1857, included a School of Jurispru- dence, in which the following studies were to be pursued: History; Political Economy ; Political Philosophy ; the Principles of Natural and International Law ; Civil and Common Law; the writings of the Greeks and Romans, and of the modern civilians and jurists, appropriate to the last three subjects. It will be observed that this depart- ment was not intended as a professional school. In con- nection with the School of Letters and the School of Science, it was to furnish a university or postgraduate course of study leading to the degree of Master of Arts, As explained by Mr. Betts, chairman of the Committee which had matured the plan, it permitted the College stu- dents, at the end of their junior year, to select either of these schools for their senior year. After receiving the Bachelor's degree, they were to be encouraged to remain for two years more in the school which they had selected, and obtain the Master’s degree. Each school was also open for graduates of other colleges. In the fall of 1857 the School of Jurisprudence had six students. 
A few months later a special committee, consisting of H. Potter, William Betts, G. G. Van Wagenen, Samuel B. Ruggles, and George F. Allen, reported that they had |      
 
-P-A-G-E-433
THE SCHOOL OF LAW 343 
“had several deliberations on the best mode of organizing 1858 
the institution in the Law Department, and that they were 
of the opinion that a greater probability of success will 
attend this department, should it be organized with a 
view of actual admission to the bar ; and that instruction 
in other and higher branches, not absolutely necessary for 
such admission, may be superadded to the course, and 
placed within the reach of students.” This superadded in- 
struction in history and the other subjects enumerated in 
the statute of 1857 was to be offered as an inducement to 
students to join the school, but was not to form a part of 
the Law School curriculum. The report was adopted, 
and the decision was reached to give the control of the 
new department to one man. A month later, in June, 
1858, the name of Theodore W. Dwight was suggested as 
Professor of Municipal Law, and his appointment was 
formally confirmed by the Trustees October 4, 1857. 
Professor Dwight had already gained a high reputation 
as a teacher of law at Hamilton College, where he had 
organized and maintained for some years a flourishing 
law school. At Columbia this reputation was not only 
maintained but enhanced, until he was recognized in Eng- 
land as one of the most eminent teachers of his day. In 
an article on “Legal Education,” Professor Dicey referred 
to him, in 1871, “as one of the ablest professors that any 
school of law ever possessed”; and again as having “a 
reputation throughout the whole Union as the greatest 
living American teacher of law, who has in substance 
founded and keeps alive, simply by his own capacity as a 
teacher, one of the best schools of law.” Shortly after- 
wards Mr. Bryce, writing upon “The Legal Profession in 
America,” declared “Columbia College is fortunate in 
possessing a professor of great legal ability and an ex- 
traordinary gift of exposition. Better law teaching than 
Mr. Dwight’s it is hardly possible to imagine; it would be

   344 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1878 worth an English student’s while to cross the Atlantic to 
   attend his course.” ! 
The school which had attained such eminence in 1871 
was opened in 1858 with much solicitude. To use Pro- 
fessor Dwight’s words: “It was not without misgiving, it 
may be not without trepidation, that a new effort was 
made to establish systematic legal instruction in New 
York.” Doubts of success might well have been enter- 
tained in view of previous failures here, and of the mod- 
erate prosperity of law schools in other places. These 
institutions, about eighteen in number, did not command 
an attendance of more than five or six hundred men. An 
enrolment of thirty-five students at the opening session 
served to dispel all doubts about the success of the new 
Law School. “The next year,” writes Professor Dwight, 
“the number of students was sixty-two. In the third 
year there were one hundred and three. Many of these 
early students were members of the bar. In one year the 
lawyers in attendance numbered seventy-five.” For many 
years nearly all the work of regular legal instruction was 
done by Professor Dwight. It is true, lectures were given 
by Professor Lieber on Political Science, by Professor 
Nairne on Moral Philosophy, by Professor Ordronaux on 
Medical Jurisprudence, and by distinguished members of 
the New York bar on special topics; but these lectures did 
not exceed three in each week, were given in the evening, 
and attendance upon them was not required. Professor 
Dicey was quite right, therefore, in declaring that the Co- 
lumbia Law School of the early seventies had been founded 
and was kept alive by the genius of a single instructor. 
The continued growth of the school called for an in- 
crease in the teaching force, and, in 1878, two professors 
were added. The requirements for admission were raised, 
and it was “determined to augment the tests of attend- 
ance and proficiency.” Provision was made, also, for a 
1 Macmillan’s Magazine, XXV, p. 209.  
-P-A-G-E-435
THE SCHOOL OF LAW 345 
third year of study for those who desired to continue their 1888 
work beyond the regular course, which covered but two 
years. Meanwhile, the legal profession of New York and 
other leading states had become convinced that the stand- 
ard of admission to the bar should be raised, and that the 
period of study should be lengthened. Effect was given 
to this opinion by the New York Court of Appeals, in its 
rules which required of candidates for the bar a three 
years’ course of study in a law office, or a course of two 
years in a law school, following a successful examination 
in certain prescribed branches. With this demand of the 
profession for higher standards of legal education, the 
Trustees of Columbia were in hearty accord. As the Law 
School had required of its first students more work and 
greater legal knowledge than were barely necessary for 
admission to the bar, so, it was felt, should the require- 
ments now be advanced correspondingly beyond those of 
the Court of Appeals. After much discussion and no 
little difference of opinion, it was decided in 1888 that the 
Law School course should be increased to three years. 
«This extension of the course,” wrote Professor Dwight 
in 1889, “is largely due to the persistent and enlightened 
efforts of Stephen P. Nash, an eminent practitioner at the 
New York bar, to whom the Law School owes a permanent 
debt of gratitude.” Another Trustee of the period, who 
took a prominent part in extending the course and raising 
the standard of legal education at Columbia, was Charles 
M. Da Costa. Before the new scheme of Law School work 
was fairly initiated, Professor Dwight availed himself of a 
provision of the university statutes which entitles a “ pro- 
fessor who has been fifteen successive years or upwards in 
the service of the university, and who is also sixty-five 
years of age or over, to be made an emeritus professor on 
half pay,” and tendered his resignation from active service, 
to take effect July 1, 1891. In accepting his resignation, 
the Trustees directed that, “in recognition of Dr. Dwight’s 
 
-P-A-G-E-436
   346 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1891 preéminent services as Warden of the Law School since 
   1858, he be requested to sit for his portrait,” and at a 
later date his honored name was given to one of the pro- 
fessorships in law. 
Upon his retirement a reorganization of the Law 
Faculty was effected, and many changes were made in 
the curriculum, as well as in the methods and aims of the 
school. With an extension of the course from two to 
three years, and an increase in the number of professors 
giving their entire time and energies to legal instruction, 
it became possible to expand the curriculum and to aug- 
ment the work required of students. Under the old 
régime, seven and one-half hours a week, during two years, 
made up the sum total of the required class-room work. 
Under the new, fourteen hours a week during three years 
are the minimum amount required, while to-day twenty- 
three hours a week are offered to the student in the second 
year and twenty-six hours in the third year. In other 
words, the work required for the degree at present is 
nearly three times as great as it was a dozen years ago, 
while the amount of private law work offered is more than 
four times as great. 
When the school was opened, and for many years there- 
after, it “was located at a distance from the College, so 
as to be nearer the business portion of the city, and more 
convenient of access to students, many of whom are con- 
nected with lawyers’ offices while pursuing their studies 
in the school, and have, therefore, to come from the lower 
portion of the city.” Thus wrote Professor Dwight in - 
1876. Accordingly, the exercises were held during the 
first year in the rooms of the Historical Society, 11th 
Street and Second Avenue ; from 1858 to 1873, in the old 
Colonnade Building, 37 Lafayette Place; and from 1873 
to 1883, at the corner of Lafayette Place and Great Jones 
Street, in a house erected and long occupied as a family 
residence by the late Peter Schermerhorn, father of the

late chairman of the Trustees. Even after the school 1872 
was removed to 49th Street and Madison Avenue, the 
lecture hours were arranged so as to give students who 
desired it the opportunity of astins most of each day in 
a law office. 
At present all law-school exercises are held on the noble 
site of the University on 116th Street. No attempt is made 
to arrange lectures for the convenience of young men in 
law offices seven or eight miles away. Indeed, the student 
is not encouraged to mingle law-office work with that of 
the Law School, but is urged to give all his time and 
energies, during the course, to a scientific study of the law. 
This policy has proved most successful. In 1893-1894 the 
enrolment of students in the school was 247. In 1903-1904 
it was 406, inclusive of 22 College seniors, who took the 
first year law work. 
Reference has been made to the fact that in the Colum- 
bia Law School of the early seventies, nearly all of the 
instruction required for the degree of Bachelor of Laws 
was given by Professor Dwight, whose title was that of 
Warden of the Law School and Professor of Municipal 
Law. From the opening of the school to the year 1875- 
1876, this remarkable teacher was accustomed to give in- 
struction to the first year class in general commentaries 
upon municipal law, upon contracts, and upon real estate. 
The second year course included equity jurisprudence, 
commercial law, the law of torts, criminal law, evidence, 
pleading, and practice. 
President Barnard in his annual report for 1872 declared 
that the success of the “school has been so signal as to 
threaten to be overwhelming to the accomplished pro- 
fessor to whose superior ability and remarkable powers as 
a teacher it has been chiefly owing ; and such as to make 
it a question requiring the early attention of the Trustees, 
in what manner he may be most effectually aided and 
relieved.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-440
  348 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
The first relief afforded was by the appointment in 1875 
of George Chase, A.B., LL.B., a graduate of the school, 
to an instructorship in the department of Municipal Law. 
A year later he became an assistant professor, having the 
subjects of Criminal Law, Torts, and Procedure. In 1879 
Judge John F. Dillon, formerly Judge of the Supreme 
Court of Iowa, and late Justice of the United States 
Circuit Court, and author of a standard treatise on “ Mu- 
nicipal Corporations,” was appointed to the chair of Real 
Estate and Equity Jurisprudence, to be succeeded in 1883 
by Benjamin F. Lee, Esq., of the New York bar. Further 
relief was afforded Professor Dwight in 1876 by the ap- 
pointment of Professor John W. Burgess to the College 
“Professorship of History, Political Science, and Inter- 
national Law, the duties of which” were to be “divided 
between the College and the Law School in such manner ” 
as might be determined thereafter. At the time of his 
appointment Professor Burgess had occupied the chair of 
Political Science at Amherst for three years, and became 
Dean of the Faculty of Political Science at Columbia 
in 1890. In his report to the President of May 16, 
1887, Professor Dwight described the work pursued by 
the senior class of that year as follows: “The rules of 
Equity Jurisprudence under Professor Lee, and the topics 
of Evidence, Torts, and the Code of Procedure under 
Professor Chase. In the topics of Shipping and Insurance 
they have been instructed by Professor Dwight. They 
have had also under him a review of the law of contracts. 
They have been reviewed by Professor Lee in the Law of 
Real Estate.” “The Junior Class,” he reported, “has 
studied under Professor Dwight the general outlines of 
Municipal Law, and more particularly the Law of Con- 
tracts, and under Professor Lee the Law of Real Estate.” 
It will be observed from this report that the scheme 
and scope of instruction had not changed materially dur- 
ing the thirty years of the school’s existence. In 1889, 
 
-P-A-G-E-441
THE SCHOOL OF LAW 349 
however, as stated on a preceding page, the Trustees de- 1891 
cided to increase the Law School course to three years. 
The new policy was not fairly launched until the autumn 
of 1891. In his first report as Dean of the reorganized 
Faculty Professor William A. Keener pointed out in 
detail the differences between the old and new schemes of 
study, the chief of which may be summarized as follows : 
(1) The new scheme assumed three years as the unit of the 
course, while the old scheme had treated two years as the 
unit. To facilitate the treatment of the subjects in detail, 
the instruction in Contracts in the first year was limited, 
under the new policy, to pure or elementary Contracts ; 
that is to the elementary principles dealing with the for- 
mation, interpretation, performance, and discharge of Con- 
tracts, while such subjects as Agency, Sales of Personal 
Property, Insurance, Negotiable Paper, and Partnership 
—in which, while the principles of Contracts are often ap- 
plied, other legal doctrines are considered — are studied in 
the second and third years. (2) Under the new scheme of 
instruction the student pursues concurrently through the 
year a number of subjects. Under the old scheme, the 
student studied one subject to its completion before 
taking up another topic. (8) The number of hours per 
week of required class-room work was largely increased. 
(4) There was also a large increase in the number of elec- 
tive subjects. (5) The student was permitted to combine 
for his degree private and public law. 
The subjects taught during the year 1891-1892 may 
well be compared with those named in Professor Dwight’s 
report of 1887. They are as follows : — 
First YEAR CruAss. Common Law Pleading and 
Procedure; Contracts; Criminal Law and Procedure; 
Elements of Jurisprudence; Domestic Relations ; Real 
Estate, and Torts. 
Seconp YEAR Crass. Administrative Law; Agency;

dence; Evidence; International Private Law; Negotiable 
Paper; Partnership; Private Corporations; Public Inter-

For 1908-1904 the subjects offered to law students by 
members of the Law Faculty and of the Political Science 
Faculty were as follows : — 
First YEAR Crass. American Constitutional Law; 
Contracts; Criminal Law; Equity; Pleading and Prac- 
tice; Real and Personal Property; Torts. 
Srconp YEAR CuiAss. Administrative Law; Admi-

tions ; Partnership ; Real and Personal Property ; Spanish- 
American Law ; Suretyship ; Taxation, Law of; Trusts and 
Perpetuities under the New York Revised Statutes; Wills 
and Administration. 
Upon the retirement of Professor Dwight from the 
school in 1891, Professor Chase, as well as Professor Rob- 
ert D, Petty, who had been lecturer and assistant professor 
since 1886, and Alfred G. Reeves, who had been a lecturer 
for one year, withdrew. The reorganized Faculty consisted 
of the Dean, William A. Keener, who came to Columbia 
in 1890 from the law Faculty of Harvard University; Fran- 
cis M. Burdick, who had been a member of the Faculties 
of the Law Schools of Hamilton College and of Cornell 
University; George M. Cumming, who came from the 
active practice of the law, and of George W. Kirchwey, 
from the deanship of the Albany Law School, while Dr. 
 
-P-A-G-E-443
  THE SCHOOL OF LAW 351 
John Ordronaux continued to give an optional course of 1903 
lectures in Medical Jurisprudence. In 1893 Charles T. 
Terry became a lecturer, and was advanced to a professor- 
ship in 1902. The Faculty was enlarged by the appoint- 
ments of George F. Canfield and Henry P. Starbuck in 
1894. Henry W. Hardon, from the Faculty of Cornell 
‘University Law School succeeded Professor Starbuck in 
1896, and was succeeded by John W. Houston in 1899. 
Upon Professor Houston’s resignation in 1901 Henry S. 
Redfield, of the School of Law of Cornell University, be- 
came a member of the Faculty. Harlan F. Stone, a lecturer 
since 1899, was advanced to an adjunct professorship in 
1908. Alfred Hayes, Jr., became a tutor in law in 1902, 
while Jackson E. Reynolds, who had been a member of the 
law Faculty of Leland Stanford University, became a lec- 
turer in 1908. In the same year Francis C. Huntington 
was appointed a lecturer and John D. Kaps a tutor, while 
James B. Scott left the deanship of the College of Law of 
the University of Illinois for a professorship in the school. 
The Law Library of the University numbers about 
80,000 volumes. Many of these have been purchased 
from funds given to the University by alumni, or have 
been presented directly to the University. Among these 
friends of the Law School may be mentioned Julien T. 
Davies, John McKeon, William G. Low, J. C. Bancroft 
Davis, A. C. Bernheim, Alexander Cole, John J. Jenkins, 
Sampson Simpson, Edgar J. Nathan, John F. Dillon, 
Miss Ida H. Ogilvie, and the Abraham Underhill Estate. 
There has also been an anonymous benefactor who has 
given large sums for the. purchase of law books. 
Other benefactors of the Law School have been Charles 
Bathgate Beck, who left the sum of $8,000 for a prize 
scholarship in the School; and Gen. Horace W. Car- 
pentier, who has recently established a fund of $100,000 
in memory of his brother, James 8. Carpentier, for the 
benefit of the School. The income of this fund will be

1904 devoted to the maintenance of courses of lectures to the 
students of the Law School by the most distinguished 
living jurists. 
During the early days of the Law School, provision was 
made for the granting of free and reduced tuition to 
needy students, but during President Low’s administra- 
tion the system of free and reduced tuition was abolished 
throughout the University and a system of scholarships 
established in its place. The Law School has now ayail- 
able for annual award twenty-one scholarships, each 
covering the tuition fee. 
The first graduating class from the Law School organ- 
ized an alumni association. Within the last two or three 
years this association, which had not been very active, has 
taken a new lease of life and now has a membership of 
800, including many of the judiciary, as well as other 
leading members of the Bar. 
The Law School Announcement for 1904-1905 gives 
the officers of government and instruction as follows : —

Not only has the teaching force been enlarged, the 
course of study been expanded, and the amount of the 
required work been increased during the last thirteen 
years, but the standard of admission has been raised. 
Until the year 1875 persons were admitted to the school 
without any preliminary examination. In 1878, as we 
have seen, requirements for admission were imposed, and 
these were increased from time to time, until the school 
was put upon a postgraduate basis at the beginning of 
the year 1903-1904. At present, graduates of colleges 
and scientific schools in good standing are admitted with- 
out examination. All persons other than such graduates 
must present satisfactory evidence of preliminary training 
obtained in higher institutions of learning in this country 
or abroad equivalent to that of a full college course.

    Ill.—THE SCHOOL OF MINES AND 
ASSOCIATED SCHOOLS 
In June, 1904, the School of Mines of Columbia Uni- 
versity completed its fortieth academic year. In com- 
parison with the mining schools of the old world it is a 
young institution. It is nevertheless the pioneer min- 
ing school of this country, and perhaps by virtue of its 
seniority has influenced more than most the development 
of mining education here. 
In connection with the School of Mines there have been 
developed at Columbia courses of instruction in architec- 
ture, in analytical, organic, and industrial chemistry, in 
civil, electrical, and mechanical engineering, and in gradu- 
ate work in pure and applied science. These have in turn 
led to the establishment of a School of Architecture under 
its own teaching staff, a School of Chemistry and a School 
of Engineering under the Faculty of Applied Science, and 
a graduate school under the Faculty of Pure Science. In 
this chapter we have to deal with the Schools of Mines, 
Chemistry, and Engineering. 
It was perhaps fortunate that the School of Mines was 
the first to be organized. The mining engineer must not 
only be well trained in general engineering studies, which 
require as a foundation mathematics, physics, mechanics, 
thermodynamics, and other mathematical subjects, but he 
must have some special knowledge of civil engineering, of 
mechanical engineering, and of electrical engineering. He 
must also be a metallurgist, which involves a knowledge of 
general chemistry, industrial chemistry, analytical chem- 
istry, and assaying. He must also be a geologist, with

expert knowledge of mineralogy and lithology. In the 1863 
attempt to provide for those needs of the mining student, 
the foundations were laid for the development of profes- 
sional instruction in many branches of science and of engi- 
neering, and for the symmetrical growth and development 
of the University in all these lines. The course in mining 
engineering, on the other hand, has profited by the growth 
of the other departments and by the equipment of labora- 
tories and the accumulation of apparatus of instruction in 
these allied branches. 
The School of Mines owes its existence to the efforts of 
the late Professor Thomas Egleston, who submitted a plan 
of organization in March, 1863, which met with the endorse- 
ment and approval of the Trustees of Columbia College. 
The Trustees had for a number of years been considering 
the establishment of a School of Applied Science, and were 
not unwilling to consider the School of Mines as a first 
step in that direction. The College treasury at that time, 
however, did not permit the Trustees to assume any large 
financial responsibility. 
In May, 1868, it was finally decided to establish a School 
of Mines, and in December, 1868, the Trustees authorized 
the setting apart of rooms in the College building for the 
use of the proposed school, and appropriated $500 for 
cases for specimens. They also authorized the appoint- 
ment of a professor without salary — thus in a very pru- 
dent and cautious manner taking the first step toward the 
establishment of the new institution. In February, 1864, 
Mr. Egleston was appointed as the first professor in the new 
School of Mines, and was intrusted with the agreeable duty 
of carrying his plans into execution. Professor Egleston 
succeeded in interesting Professor Francis L. Vinton and 
Professor Charles F. Chandler in the project, and in 
September, and October, 1864, these gentlemen received 
appointments, also without salary, from the Trustees. 
Professors William G. Peck, Charles A. Joy, and

  356 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1864 J. Howard Van Amringe of Columbia College, having 
volunteered their services, were assigned to seats in the 
new Faculty. In 1866 the Chair of Geology was created 
and filled by the appointment of John 8. Newberry. 
Of these seven professors five had studied abroad and 
were familiar with the educational traditions of the uni- 
versities of the old world. Professors Egleston and 
Vinton had been students of the Hcole des Mines of 
Paris, Professor Chandler and Professor Joy had taken 
their doctorates at Géttingen, and Professor Newberry 
had studied for two yearsin Paris. Professors Vinton and 
Peck and later Professor Trowbridge were distinguished 
graduates of West Point. Professor Egleston was a 
graduate of Yale and Professor Chandler of Harvard. 
Most, if not all, of the new Faculty were experienced in- 
structors, and from the first their deliberations were 
influenced and guided by the distinguished educator and 
scientific scholar, President Frederick A. P. Barnard. 
The influence of these founders of the School of Mines 
is to be seen in most of the principal features of the 
institution as it exists to-day. To the thorough mathe- 
matical foundation for engineering studies, characteristic 
of West Point, has been added the logical arrangement 
and systematic development of subjects of the Keole des 
Mines, and the thoroughness and scientific accuracy of 
the German university. From the beginning the School 
of Mines has been cosmopolitan, reflecting the character 
of the metropolis in which it is located, and has drawn 
its inspirations from the best educational traditions of 
the old world and the new. This character has been 
maintained throughout its history, and the Faculty to-day, 
while largely alumni of Columbia, as is natural, is more 
than one-third composed of graduates of other colleges 
and professional schools, while over one-half have been 
at one time connected with other institutions as profes- 
sors or students.

The development of the present course of instruction 1868 has been a gradual one. At first the requirements for admission included only algebra, geometry, and plane 
trigonometry. In 1866 analytical trigonometry was 
added. In 1868 the age of admission was raised from 
sixteen to eighteen years, spherical trigonometry, general 
chemistry, and physics were added to the requirements for 
admission, and a preparatory year was organized, in which 
instruction was given in these and other subjects. In 1876-7 this preparatory year was made the first year and 
the course increased to four years, as at the present time. 
From time to time the requirements for admission have 
steadily increased. In 1877, for example, to enter the 
new first class, the student must have reached the age 
of seventeen, and was required to pass examinations in elementary algebra, geometry, and show a slight knowledge 
of French and German. Six years later the requirements, 
in addition to the above, included arithmetic ; English 
grammar, composition, and rhetoric ; United States and 
English history ; physical geography, and free-hand draw- 
ing; and a more intimate knowledge of French and Ger- 
man. In 1887 the age for entrance was again increased 
to eighteen years. At the present time, the applicant 
must have completed the equivalent of a four years’ high 
school course, and must pass examinations in mathematics, 
including elementary and advanced algebra, plane and 
solid geometry, plane and spherical trigonometry, in ele- 
mentary physics and chemistry, and in English, French, 
German, and history. Latin and Spanish are accepted 
as substitutes for French. 
The relative weight attached to these subjects is as follows : —

It will be noticed that English, history, German, and 
French (or other language substituted for French), 
count for 9 points out of 16, or about 56 per cent of the 
total requirements. 
Columbia stands almost alone in exacting requirements 
of this character, and also is almost alone in devoting no 
time in the professional courses to studies of a liberal 
character. At other institutions the equivalent of one 
or one and a half years is given to culture studies. At 
Columbia all the time in the four years is devoted to 
fundamental training in mathematics and science, and 
to professional studies. A part of this work, however, 
nearly the equivalent of two years, is of a real collegiate 
character, and not in any way inferior to the so-called 
culture studies as a means of mental discipline, while 
the time gained for professional work by the exclusion 
of the other culture studies, such as language, economics, 
history, has added very greatly to the value of the profes- 
sional training given at Columbia. It is recognized that 
this has been done at a certain sacrifice. This sacrifice 
has been deliberately made, and it is believed that the 
gain more than balances the loss. The loss is in part 
offset, it is true, by the 56 per cent of culture studies in 
the requirements for admission. The Faculty have long 
recognized, however, the great importance of collegiate 
studies to the professional man, and have for many years 
strongly urged all candidates for admission to take at least 
two years of college work before entering upon the engi- 
neering courses. As a result of this policy, and of the 
high requirements for admission, about 35 per cent of the 
students have had one or more years of college training, 
and nearly half this number have taken a first degree.

To provide a better education for the professional stu- 1904 
dents a combined collegiate and professional course of 
six years has been organized at Columbia, and has been 
in successful operation since 1897. Students taking this 
course are registered in the College for four years, but are 
allowed to take the studies of the first and second years 
under the Faculty of Applied Science and count them 
toward the A.B. degree. As the studies of these two 
years are mainly of a collegiate character, — mathematics, 
mechanics, chemistry, physics, mineralogy, geology, and 
the like,—the result is satisfactory from the collegiate 
standpoint, as this combined course fulfils all the require- 
ments of a liberal education, and there is undoubtedly 
great gain to the professional student taking such a 
course. It is not improbable that in the near future the’ 
Faculty may take action looking toward the requirement 
of this six years’ course for all professional students. 
In other words, the complete professional engineering 
course of study finally contemplated at Columbia Univer- 
sity is six years in length, the first three being devoted to 
what may be termed a general college training and the 
last three to technical work. The formulation of this 
complete course of professional study is one of the most 
important steps yet taken in Columbia University, and it 
is much to be desired that this curriculum may at the ear- 
liest practicable date become the required course of study, 
rather than an optional course as it now stands. 
At the beginning the course of study in the School of 
Mines was three years. In 1868, as already noted, a 
fourth year was added. At first there was but one course 
of study, that for the degree of mining engineer. In 1868 
additional courses in metallurgy, in geology, and natural 
history, and in analytical and applied chemistry were 
added, and the school became a school of applied science, 
though retaining the special name of School of Mines. 
In 1869 a course in civil engineering was added. Later,  
-P-A-G-E-454
  360 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1896 in 1881, a course in architecture, in 1889 a course in 
electrical engineering, and in 1897, on the removal to 
the present site, a course in mechanical engineering. 
In 1896 it was recognized that the name “School of 
Mines” was inadequate to cover the many lines of study 
offered. At the same time, under this name, the institu- 
tion had become well known throughout the country, and 
it was not thought advisable to change or abandon the 
name under which this reputation had been secured. The 
difficulty was met by organizing four schools, viz., a School 
of Mines, a School of Chemistry, a School of Engineering, 
and a School of Architecture. All of these were placed 
under the direction of the Faculty of Applied Science, a 
‘form of organization not uncommon abroad, and adopted 
in a number of cases here. The School of Architecture 
in 1902 was put on an independent footing, and will 
eventually come under the jurisdiction of a Faculty of 
Fine Arts, when that body shall be organized. 
The School of Mines has passed through several pe- 
riods of reorganization, each of which has materially 
increased the efficiency of instruction. 
In 1877 Professor Francis L. Vinton resigned the chair 
of Civil and Mining Engineering, and Professor William 
Petit Trowbridge was called from the Sheffield Scientific 
School to the chair of Engineering. At the same time 
Henry S. Munroe was appointed adjunct professor of 
Surveying and Practical Mining, and Frederick Remsen 
Hutton was made instructor in Mechanical Engineering. 
Under this reorganization the instruction in engineering 
was greatly strengthened and its scope increased. On 
the theoretical side new courses were added, and existing 
courses were subdivided and developed. On the practical 
side a summer course in mining was organized for the 
systematic study of mining methods and of mine plant 
at the mines, and instruction in surveying field work was
-P-A-G-E-455
SCHOOL OF MINES AND ASSOCIATED SCHOOLS 861 
introduced, at first in the afternoons and on Saturdays in 1889 
Central Park, and later as a regularly organized summer 
class at a permanent camp in Litchfield County, Connecti- 
cut. The fifteen years during which Professor Trowbridge 
remained at the head of the Engineering department were 
years of important progress, in which the courses in mining 
engineering, civil engineering, and later electrical engi- 
neering were firmly established on a sound basis. Pro- 
fessor Trowbridge believed that in each of these courses 
the aim should be first to emphasize the engineering side 
of the profession, and give the student thorough training 
in the mathematical studies which lie at the base of all 
engineering design work. This foundation he believed 
should be practically the same for all classes of engineers, 
and to his insistence on this thorough fundamental engi- 
neering training in all courses is largely due the reputation 
the School of Mines has attained in late years. 
In 1889, under the administration of Professor Trow- 
bridge, there was established a course in electrical engi- 
neering leading to the degree of electrical engineer. 
Francis B. Crocker and Michael I. Pupin were appointed 
instructors, the former to cover the applied, and the 
latter the theoretical side of the subject. To provide for 
the immediate demand for trained engineers the course 
at first was open to graduates in civil, mining, and 
mechanical engineering. Nineteen graduate students en- 
rolled for the two years’ course, but the demand for the 
services of even partly trained men proved so great that 
but five remained to take the degree. Their places were 
taken by others, and for a number of years a few men 
were graduated each year from this graduate course. 
Later, provision was made for such graduate students in 
the regular course, as is the case to-day. 
The time seemed ripe for the establishment of a full 
four year course in electrical engineering. With the 
 
-P-A-G-E-456
  362 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1892 rapid development of the applications of electricity to 
useful purposes, including telegraphy, telephone service, 
electric lighting, and electric power, the work had largely 
fallen into the hands of men without special training. 
In many cases these pioneers in electrical engineering had 
not even the advantage of a general scientific education. 
A limited number had taken courses in mechanical, civil, 
or mining engineering, and others had studied a certain 
amount of mathematics, physics, and chemistry, giving 
them a fair foundation for electrical work. 
In October, 1892, as a result of the experience gained 
with the graduate course, a full four year course in elec- 
trical engineering was organized, and started with an 
enrolment of 64 students. In outlining the curriculum 
it was determined to adapt it from the beginning to the 
needs of the electrical engineer, and not to adopt the 
makeshift of modifying existing courses by the addition 
of a few electrical subjects. As in the other courses 
in the School of Mines Professor Trowbridge’s influence 
secured as a foundation, not only the usual courses in 
mathematics, mechanics, physics, and chemistry, but in 
addition a thorough training in general engineering 
studies. As he himself expressed it, “the student should 
first be made an engineer, and afterward an electrical 
engineer.” This was by no means the general opinion 
at the time; in fact, Professor Trowbridge was probably 
the first to clearly and fully appreciate what the profes- 
sion of electrical engineering was destined to become. At 
most institutions the policy of grafting a few electrical 
studies on courses of general science, or on courses in 
mechanical engineering, marked the extent of the effort 
made to meet the demand. The establishment of a com- 
plete and well-balanced curriculum in electrical engineer- 
ing from the beginning was a new and radical departure, 
in which for many years Columbia, and one other insti- 
tution, stood alone. In practically all other cases the  
-P-A-G-E-457
  SCHOOL OF MINES AND ASSOCIATED SCHOOLS 363 
instructors, the laboratories, the apparatus, and the in- 1994 
struction formed an integral part either of a department 
of physics, or of a department of mechanical engineering. 
At Columbia special laboratories for instruction in elec- 
trical engineering were installed from the beginning, two 
additional floors being built for the purpose over the 
existing power house at the 49th Street site. 
Both the two year and the four year courses were 
successful from the first, both in reputation gained 
and in the number of students attracted by the instruc- 
tion offered. The standing of the graduates, and of the 
course of study, is as high as that of any in the country. 
It may fairly be claimed that the tendency at other 
institutions is to follow the lead of Columbia, and to 
modify their courses in electrical engineering, and to 
develop them along the lines originally formulated here. 
At Columbia the general character of the course has re- 
mained substantially the same as that originally planned, 
though at the same time the newer branches and more 
recent developments both in theory and practice have 
been given due place and prominence. The removal of 
the University to the new site in 1897 made possible 
many additions and improvements in laboratory equip- 
ment by reason of the greater space available. 
In addition to its special work of training electrical 
engineers the department offers instruction and laboratory 
practice to students in the mechanical, civil, and mining 
engineering courses and to students of chemistry and 
metallurgy. 
Instruction in mechanical engineering at Columbia has 
been of gradual growth. Beginning in the early years of 
the School of Mines with a single course of lectures on 
machines and the purchase of a testing machine by Pro- 
fessor Francis L. Vinton, it received its first forward 
impulse on the reorganization of the department of engi-
-P-A-G-E-458
  364 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1904 neering in 1877 in the appointment of Frederick Remsen 
Hutton, the present head of the department, as instructor 
in mechanical engineering. Lectures were delivered on 
power-plant practice and power transmission, and a few 
years later in locomotive design and general railroad 
engineering and in properties of materials. In 1889 the 
Emery and the Riehle testing machines were added to the 
equipment of the department, and in 1890 an assistant in 
mechanical engineering was appointed to take part of the 
instruction and assist in the laboratory work. In 1894 
the first beginning of a mechanical laboratory was 
created, by gifts of experimental steam engines, condens- 
ers, and weighing apparatus. ‘The use of this laboratory 
at the beginning was mainly by graduates, as no provision 
for laboratory work was then made in the regular courses. 
On the removal of the University to the new site a course 
in mechanical engineering was created, and the full equip- 
ment of the new laboratories was begun with three munifi- 
cent gifts, — the Worthington hydraulic laboratory in 1897, 
followed in 1899 by the Allis triple expansion engine and 
three-stage air compressor, and the Baldwin locomotive 
“Columbia.” Among recent additions to the equipment 
may be noted a number of gas and oil engines, which per- 
mit special emphasis on this type of motor. 
The new course began with the enrolment of 14 stu- 
dents in October, 1897, since which time the numbers have 
rapidly increased from year to year to a total of 103 at 
the present time. 
The shop work required of all students in the early years 
of the course is done in the woodworking, pattern mak- 
ing, and machine shops, and forges of Teachers College 
under a professor and three instructors. The drawing for 
all engineering courses is under the charge of this depart- 
ment and demands the services of an adjunct professor 
and two tutors. The engineering design for mechanical 
students is conducted by an adjunct professor and a tutor, 
 
-P-A-G-E-459
SCHOOL OF MINES AND ASSOCIATED SCHOOLS 365 
while the work in the mechanical laboratories demands 1893 the services of an adjunct professor, an instructor, and two assistants. In all, the force of the department in- cludes two professors, three adjunct professors, four instructors, three tutors, and three assistants. 
In the fourth year the students are given the choice be- tween three alternative courses of study : 1, the power- house option; 2, the locomotive option, and 8, the marine 
option which are arranged for those who desire to specialize in one or another line of work. The fine equipment of the shops and laboratories makes possible a large amount of useful laboratory work in course, and most important research work by advanced students. 
A course for the degree of Civil Engineer was estab- lished in the School of Mines in 1869. At first it did not differ materially from the course in mining, and many students took both degrees. The course of instruction, as it exists at the present time, dates from the appoint- ment of Professor Trowbridge to the chair of Engineering in 1877. After the death of Professor Trowbridge in 1892 a new chair of Civil Engineering was created and filled by the appointment of William H. Burr, professor of Engineering at the Lawrence Scientific School, a graduate and at one time professor at the Rensselaer Polytechnic. 
At present the department of Civil Engineering requires 
the services of two professors, an instructor, a tutor, and 
an_ assistant. 
Shortly after the death of Professor Trowbridge, the department of Engineering was abolished, and in 1893 separate chairs of Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engi- neering, and Electrical Engineering were created. This important change marked the beginning of a period of growth and development in all these departments, and in none more than in the new department of Civil Engineering. 
 
-P-A-G-E-460
366 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1904 Under the old organization, in which the unity of the 
different engineering professions was emphasized, much 
that was valuable was accomplished, especially in the 
development of the newer lines of engineering work, 
which were from the beginning established on a solid 
foundation of engineering studies. At the same time, 
the older profession of civil engineering did not receive 
that special attention, nor did it attain that development 
in detail, which was demanded by the increasing call for 
efficient professional instruction of the highest grade. 
From the standpoint of the civil engineer, many of the 
subjects leading to that degree, administered as parts of a 
general engineering course, were of necessity more or less 
elementary, and in many cases insufficiently developed to 
meet the exacting demands of modern engineering prac- 
tice. Again, under the old organization the staff was not 
large enough to cover the ground completely, and many 
important civil engineering subjects were of necessity 
omitted from the curriculum. 
The first efforts in the organization of the new depart- 
ment were directed to secure a development along the 
lines of advanced professional work, fundamentally recon- 
structing those courses taken over from the old curriculum 
and supplying a considerable number of wholly new sub- 
jects. This work of reconstruction was radical through- 
out the department, but the endeavor was to accomplish it 
without doing violence to the traditions of the institution 
or to break continuity in that part of the educational train- 
ing found in what was then called the School of Mines. 
The main idea running through this organization of the 
department was the historical conception of the profession 
of civil engineering as embracing all engineering not 
military or naval. Under this view, civil engineering 
is not a specialty but the main trunk or stem of all 
engineering involved in the business of civil life. This 
in no manner trenches upon the development or growth

of the great specialties which have assumed such impor- 1904 
tance within the past two or three decades. It simply 
means that the department of Civil Engineering at Colum- 
bia University has been organized on a broad and substan- 
tial recognition of the fact that the professional civil 
engineer should have an educational training so compre- 
hensive and thorough in character as to include all the 
fundamental principles of engineering. science. This 
organization has been so completed, and the curriculum 
so formulated as to give all students pursuing the course 
in civil engineering a thorough grasp and command of 
the general principles of engineering science, not only in 
its applications to construction, but also to the design and. 
operation of machinery, to power plants, both electric and 
steam, and to the organization and direction of all classes 
of engineering enterprises. It has been and is the pur- 
pose to base the educational training of students funda- 
mentally upon a thorough knowledge of general principles, 
and then to develop the application of them to typical 
subjects of engineering practice in all the fields of struc- 
tures, transportation, and the manufacture, distribution, 
and application of power, as far as it is practicable to do 
so in the professional school. 
In this instruction it is appreciated that the professional 
school has certain peculiar functions or responsibilities to 
discharge, but that no young man can be made a finished 
practitioner by such instruction. Indeed his complete edu- 
cational training must consist first and imperatively of that 
educational preparation which he can obtain only in the 
professional school supplemented by the influences of the 
first few years of his practical life in developing his judg- 
ment and those other qualities of administrative character 
which give him executive capacity. 
The first year of the present course in civil engineer- 
ing is devoted largely to general mathematical and physical 
subjects, chiefly preparatory to the more technical work 
 
-P-A-G-E-464
  368 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1904 of the subsequent three years, although the students de- 
vote considerable time to surveying and shop work. The 
second year of the course may be considered as being 
devoted practically to technical or professional subjects, 
although it is largely preparatory to the more advanced 
professional work of the third and fourth years. During 
this year such subjects as calculus, mechanics, road engineer- 
ing, elements of electrical engineering, and other subjects 
of a similar general character are either begun or com- 
pleted. The first extended application of mathematical 
and physical studies to engineering work is found in the 
third year, during the first half of which advanced analyti- 
cal mechanics is completed. Such subjects as the resist- 
ance of materials, masonry structures, thermo-dynamics, 
electrical engineering, engineering of power plants and 
other truly professional subjects of study, find numerous 
and extended applications to practical engineering prob- 
lems. Similar general observations apply to that portion 
of the curriculum covered by the work of the fourth year. 
In this year actual design work is extensively done to- 
gether with the completion of working drawings and 
specifications for bridges and buildings, hydraulic and 
public works, the steam-engine and accessories, pumps 
and pumping engines, advanced railroad work and sewer 
systems, and a considerable number of other classes of 
engineering structures and machines, supplemented by a 
graduating thesis to which a large amount of time is de- 
voted. In this thesis work it is the purpose to throw the 
student as much as possible upon his own resources in the 
design or other treatment of some special piece of engi- 
neering work for which he himself must secure all data, 
make trips of observation to similar works in progress, 
complete working drawings and specifications, and per 
form such other work as may be required of identically 
the same character as that done in the best engineering 
offices of the country.

In addition to this work performed at the University 1904 
during the academic year, the department conducts an 
admirably equipped summer school of surveying during the 
three summer months on a tract of about six hundred acres 
of land owned by the University at Morris, Connecticut, 
known as Camp Columbia. Permanent buildings and 
other improvements, including an excellent water supply, 
have been constructed at this summer camp, where all 
students taking the courses in civil or mining engineering 
must spend a number of weeks each summer vacation in 
actual surveying operations. 
The summer camp has a large outfit of surveying instru- 
ments so that the classes may be divided into very small 
squads, usually not over three men, resulting in a maxi- 
mum of individual work and personal training. Each 
student has in all fifteen to sixteen weeks’ field work 
divided between the three summer vacations, in which 
time he executes a large number of surveys, and acquires 
a high degree of skill in the adjustment and use of survey- 
ing instruments, and in the conduct of topographical and 
engineering surveys, and the computations and mapping 
incident thereto, including plans and specifications for 
railroad work. The surveying course is unique in the 
high degree of accuracy required in all surveying work. 
In the earlier surveys executed by each student all the 
work is done upon areas covered with fixed monuments, 
the relative position and height of each of which is accu- 
rately known. The student’s work is thus checked on 
every individual measurement of distance, direction, and 
elevation, and he is forced to use the greatest care, and 
to employ only correct methods of work from the very 
beginning. 
In this manner each student receives not only instruc- 
tion but actual experience in the field in every branch of 
engineering surveying, from simple pacing surveys to an 
elaborate and complete railroad survey, including final

1904 location of line and structures. These railroad lines, as 
well as other surveys of the summer school, are necessarily 
extended far beyond the limits of the University’s prop- 
erty, so as to secure sufficient length of line and ample 
extent of country for all the practical operations contem- 
plated. It is confidently believed that no other institu- 
tion, either in Europe or in this country, affords equal 
facilities for practical field work so extensively developed 
or so efficiently conducted as at this summer school. 
The subject of railroad organization and administration, 
including all the various operations of the great field of 
transportation, are receiving special treatment and careful 
development in the department. The study of subjects 
included under instruction in railroad work is conducted 
closely along lines of actual railroad operation exhibited 
by the great trunk lines of the country, so that every stu- 
dent taking this course is brought directly in contact with 
all the main features of railroad construction, maintenance, 
and operation, as found in the best railroad systems of 
the present time. This branch of engineering work has 
made great advances since the creation of the department, 
and that fact is recognized in the instruction given. 
The general plans of instruction are those which have 
grown up naturally under the test of years of experience, 
and are shaped so as to convey to the student the desired 
information in the different subjects of the course with 
the greatest possible efficiency attainable. A limited 
amount of lecture work is given where that method may 
be advantageously used, but the fundamental idea is to 
stimulate the student to active work with the least amount 
of unproductive effort. In general, the classroom exer- 
cises are intended to avoid the objectionable features of 
pure lecture work, and to render unnecessary the labor of 
taking other than occasional notes, by substituting ques- 
tions or other similar means of stimulating productive 
thought by the student either in the demonstration of
-P-A-G-E-467
  SCHOOL OF MINES AND ASSOCIATED SCHOOLS 3871 
principles or in their applications to definite engineering 1904 
works or problems. This classroom work is supplemented 
by extended exercises in the application of the general 
principles discussed and established in the classroom to a 
great variety of actual designs or to problems leading to 
actual design. While the solution of many of these prac- 
tical problems, involving the application of general princi- 
ples of engineering science, requires computations only, a 
large number of them require completion of actual work- 
ing drawings, such as are placed in machine shops in prac- 
tice for the manufacture of either machines or structures, 
or which may be used in the field for the construction of 
railroad works or any of the class of large public works 
for cities or towns, or for even larger national works. 
These general plans of instruction enable the student to 
acquire the greatest amount of professional information 
with the least waste of effort and in the most direct and 
efficient manner. 
The department also supplements classroom work by 
extensive laboratory operations which in the first and 
second years of the course are chiefly conducted in the 
physical and chemical laboratories available to its students. 
The purely departmental laboratories include all branches 
of cement and road materials testing, the testing of all 
kinds of structural materials, such as artificial and natural 
stones, iron, steel, timber, and concrete-steel. The stu- 
dents are also given series of practical operations in vari- 
ous lines of hydraulic work, steam-engines, pumps, and 
electrical machinery. 
The complete educational procedure, therefore, is sym- 
metrically developed and completely rounded in every 
feature. There has been an earnest desire to omit no part 
of the professional civil engineer’s educational training, 
either purely physical or practical, but to finish each of 
its graduates in the most complete and satisfactory man- 
ner for the beginning of his professional career. The
-P-A-G-E-468
  3872 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1904 fact that many inquiries for young engineers are con- 
stantly made to the department to which no response can 
be made, no graduates, as a rule, being without positions, 
seems to indicate that the end has generally been to a 
reasonable degree attained. 
  
    The School of Chemistry offers three four-year courses 
of a professional character in analytical chemistry, in 
organic chemistry, and in industrial chemistry. The sub- 
jects taught are substantially the same in all three of 
these courses, the chief difference is in the distribution of 
hours in the Analytical, Organic, and Industrial laborato- 
vies. The department of chemistry also has charge of all 
chemical instruction in the University, in the College, in 
the School of Mines, in the School of Engineering, and in 
the graduate School of Pure Science. The training of 
professional chemists in the School of Chemistry is thus 
but a part of the larger work of the department. 
Like the other professional schools, the School of Chemis- 
try had its origin in the School of Mines, and has been under 
the direction of Professor Charles F. Chandler from the be- 
ginning. It was set off from the School of Mines in 1896, 
but remains under the control of the Faculty of Applied 
Science. In 1864-65 Professor Chandler had two labora- 
tory assistants, to-day the department includes three pro- 
fessors, three adjunct professors, three instructors, eleven 
tutors, and five assistants. Until 1897 the work was done 
in three laboratories. To-day the chemical department 
has twelve laboratories, occupying the greater part of 
Havemeyer. A chemical museum containing over ten 
thousand specimens has been established to illustrate the 
instruction given in pure and applied chemistry.   
To return to the School of Mines itself; the main pur- 
pose of this school is to train men to undertake the de- 
velopment of mineral properties, and to manage mines
-P-A-G-E-469
SCHOOL OF MINES AND ASSOCIATED SCHOOLS 373 
and metallurgical works. This training must be a broad 1904 
one, as the duties of the mining engineer involve applica- 
tion of the sciences of mineralogy, petrology, and geology, 
in both the surface and underground exploration of min- 
eral deposits, of civil, mechanical, and electrical engineer- 
ing in the construction and operation of mine plant and 
mining machinery, and of dressing, milling, and metal- 
lurgy in the treatment of the products of the mine. 
These subjects require that the student shall be well 
grounded in mathematics, physics, mechanics, and chem- 
istry, and that in each the instruction shall be thorough 
and complete. The course is, therefore, a very broad 
one. It is manifestly impossible in an article of this 
character to go into details of the scheme of instruction, 
but some of its salient features may be emphasized, 
which will serve also to illustrate the general character 
of the work done in the associated schools. ‘ 
Great stress is laid upon laboratory and field-work 
training. The chemical laboratories for qualitative and 
quantitative analysis and assaying, the mineralogical and 
geological laboratories, the physical laboratories, and the 
drafting rooms are among the finest in the country. 
Laboratory instruction in chemistry and assaying ex- 
tends through three years—in drafting, through all four 
years. Laboratory instruction in mineralogy and geology 
extends through three or four years, and includes half a 
year’s work with the microscope on thin sections of 
minerals and rocks. This not only fits the student for 
subsequent studies in his professional practice of the 
phenomena of ore deposition, but also furnishes an admi- 
rable introduction to the microscopic study of metals and 
alloys, which is included in the required work in the metal- 
lurgical laboratory later. 
An important feature of laboratory instruction in the 
School of Mines is the prominence given to work in the 
engineering, mining, and metallurgical laboratories. In 
 
-P-A-G-E-470
3874 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1904 these the student continues the work begun in the chemi- 
cal and physical laboratories, and is given opportunity for 
the experimental demonstration of the physical, mechani- 
cal or chemical laws and general fundamental principles 
underlying any given branch of engineering. These 
laboratories are also equipped to train the student in the 
making of scientific tests of engineering materials, and 
working tests of machines and processes of ore treatment, 
thus preparing him as far as is possible in the school for 
work that he will be called upon to do as an engineer. 
Among these are the testing laboratories for determin- 
ing the strength and other physical qualities of engineer- 
ing materials; the mechanical laboratories equipped with 
large and small steam engines, gas and petroleum engines, 
air compressors, pumps, and auxiliary apparatus; the 
electrical laboratories with direct and alternating current 
generators, motors, dynamos, and transformers, are and 
incandescent lighting apparatus, and other necessary 
apparatus ; the metallurgical laboratories equipped with 
large and small furnaces heated by fuel, gas, or electric 
current, and with apparatus for illustrating lixiviation, pre- 
cipitation, chlorination, amalgamation, and other chemi- 
cal processes; and finally the mining laboratories equipped 
with small and full-sized crushing, screening, and sampling 
apparatus, and small and large concentrating machines of 
different types. 
All these laboratories are furnished with the necessary 
instruments of precision for making tests ; and the min- 
ing students are required to perform for themselves a 
series of experiments in each laboratory designed to sup- 
plement the classroom and field instruction and give 
them the necessary training of hand and eye required 
for successful laboratory manipulation. 
Practical instruction in summer courses is developed at 
Columbia to an extent not found elsewhere. Prominent 
among these are the summer courses of surveying, courses 
 
-P-A-G-E-471
  SCHOOL OF MINES AND ASSOCIATED SCHOOLS 375 
given at Morris, Connecticut, which have been already 1904 
mentioned. 
The summer course in practical mining is another 
important feature of instruction which originated at 
Columbia twenty-seven years ago, and which since has 
been added to the curriculum of other mining schools. 
This school of observation has the same relation to the 
study of mining as clinical instruction and hospital prac- 
tice to the study of medicine and surgery. The pro- 
gramme at the summer course includes detailed studies of 
the operations of mining, and of mine equipment, under- 
ground and on the surface, and of the problems of mine 
organization and administration. The work is done at 
some prominent mine selected for the purpose, and the 
students are assigned each day special subjects of study, 
and are put in the charge of skilled miners or mine offi- 
cials, in small squads of two or three men, for the accom- 
plishment of their assigned work. During the day they 
are frequently visited by competent instructors, and at 
night they are expected to hand in detailed notes and 
sketches of thé subject assigned for the day’s work, which 
notes are closely scrutinized and criticised by the instruc- 
tors in charge. In this and similar ways it is attempted 
to develop the student’s powers of observation, and to 
encourage him in habits of careful and critical study, and 
above all of making intelligent notes and sketches of a 
character likely to be useful to him afterwards. Incident- 
- ally the student accumulates much valuable information 
as to the geological occurrence of minerals, and regarding 
the details of mining practice and the problems of mine 
administration in the mining region visited, which add 
much to the value of the lectures on mining and allied 
subjects attended by him when he returns to the School of 
Mines for the work of his fourth and final year. In the 
words of one of the professors “the students seem five 
years older when they come back to us in the fall after
-P-A-G-E-472
  376 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1904 attendance at one of these summer schools.” As far as 
possible the summer courses have been held in the older 
and better-developed mining regions, that the students 
may have the advantage of studying the best and most- 
approved practice. Summer sessions have been held in 
the bituminous and anthracite mines of Pennsylvania, at 
iron mines in New Jersey, New York, and Michigan, at 
copper mines in Michigan and Montana, at lead mines in 
Missouri, at mines of gold and silver in Colorado and 
Utah. This summer (1904), through the liberality of Mr. 
George Crocker, a joint summer mining class with students 
and instructors from Columbia, Yale, and Harvard Univer- 
sities and from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 
was held at Silver Plume, Colorado, under most advanta- 
geous conditions. A portion of the Dives Pelican mine 
was leased by the school and operated with a small force 
of skilled miners, and equipped with modern mining 
machinery. The students, under the direction of skilled 
miners, were required to take part in the actual operations 
of mining. In addition they made underground surveys, 
took samples from the mine workings, from the stopes, 
and from the led dumps, and made critical study of mill- 
ing operations, taking samples by which to determine the 
efficiency of the work done. Many things were thus 
included in the course of instruction which had not be- 
fore been attempted, and this summer session marks a 
decided advance in this field of mining education. 
Summer courses in geology for the benefit of students 
in mining are held each year, at which the students are 
instructed in methods of geological field work and are 
required to construct maps and geological sections from 
their notes. 
Summer courses in metallurgy are likewise held each 
summer at important metallurgical works in different 
parts of the country, for the practical study of the metal- 
lurgy of iron, steel, copper, lead, zinc, and gold and silver.

While much time is thus given to practical training in 
the laboratories, in the field, and at the mines and metal- 
lurgical establishments, great care is taken to subordinate 
this instruction to the regular classroom work, and espe- 
cially in subjects which are fundamental. In all such 
subjects a high standard of accomplishment is rigorously 
maintained. 
In the summer preceding the final year of the mining 
course the students are assigned, as the subject of their 
graduation theses, the problem of the opening and develop- 
ment of a mine, which is supposed to be located in some 
well-known mining district, and for which certain definite 
conditions as to size and character of ore body, amount 
of water to be pumped, and quantity of ore to be mined 
are assumed. During the summer the student visits the 
assigned region and studies on the spot the conditions 
under which mining is there conducted, and obtains data 
for his thesis work. During the winter he decides upon 
the proper method of opening, developing, and working the 
property, and makes estimates of the plant, machinery, 
and capital required, and the probable cost of working 
and profits obtainable. In addition to this he is required 
to work out in detail certain portions of the proposed 
mine plant, and to prepare a series of working drawings, 
bill of materials and specifications therefor, computing 
carefully the strength of all the parts. This work and 
the preparation of the thesis is done under the super- 
vision of competent instructors, and constitutes both a 
review and a series of practical applications of the pre- 
paratory studies of previous years, and gives the students 
an opportunity to discover and remedy weak places in 
their professional training, and gives them at the same 
time some degree of confidence in their ability to work 
out similar problems later. It is believed that the scheme 
of instruction developed at the School of Mines during 
the forty years of its usefulness accomplishes the follow-
-P-A-G-E-475
SCHOOL OF MINES AND ASSOCIATED SCHOOLS 379 
ing important educational results for the students com- 1904 
pleting the course : — 
1. A broad and thorough fundamental training in 
mathematics and science. 
2. An engineering education of a high order. 
3. An exceptionally complete training of hand and eye 
in laboratory and field work. 
4, The special professional training in geology, mining, 
and metallurgy necessary for the mining or metallurgical 
engineer. 
That the education offered preserves a fair balance 
between the exacting requirements above outlined seems 
to be indicated by the professional success of the School 
of Mines graduates, and by the large and increasing num- 
bers of students coming to Columbia from all parts of the 
country, and from abroad. 
The School of Mines and associated schools are fortu- 
nate in the location and environment of the University, 
which draws its students from the section of the country 
possessing greatest educational opportunities. This has 
enabled the Faculty to maintain high requirements for 
admission, and to exact a high standard of accomplish- 
ment from its students. The excellent material with 
which it has had to deal, as well as the quality of instruc- 
tion given, is shown in the large degree of professional 
success attained by graduates of the School of Mines and 
associated schools, who are now in charge of large indus- 
trial enterprises of important public works, and of suc- 
cessful mines and metallurgical establishments in all 
parts of North and South America, from New Brunswick 
and Alaska to Chile and Peru, and in Asia, Africa, and 
Australia. 
The alumni of the School of Mines and associated 
schools have also, directly and indirectly, exerted much 
influence on the development and educational policy of 
 
-P-A-G-E-476
380 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1904 the institution, in which they have at all times, exhibited 
most loyal and hearty interest. 
In 1893 the alumni raised the sum of $10,000 to estab- 
lish the William Petit Trowbridge Fellowship. The in- 
come of the fund is to be not less than $500 a year and 
is to be paid to the widow of Professor Trowbridge during 
her lifetime. Since 1898 an equipment and endowment 
fund of nearly $30,000 has been raised for the depart- 
ments of mining and metallurgy, of which alumni of the 
School of Mines have contributed over one-third. Mr. 
William C. Illig of the class of ’82 bequeathed $2000 
to establish medals to be awarded to the most proficient 
members of the graduating class, and Mr. B. B. Lawrence 
of the class of ’78 maintains a scholarship in the School. 
Another scholarship in memory of the late Marcus Daly, of 
the annual value of $1000, has been established in the pres- 
ent year for students from Montana who have either worked 
in the mines of that state or are the descendants of miners. 
In addition to these, the University offers 35 scholarships 
each of the annual value of $250, the amount of the tui- 
tion, and by the bequest of Edward A. Darling a prize of 
$40 for the most faithful and deserving member of the 
graduating class in Engineering was established in 1904. 
At Commencement, 1904, the President made the wel- 
come announcement that through the generosity of Mr. 
Adolph Lewisohn, President of the United Metals Selling 
Company, a much-needed School of Mines Building is to 
be erected, at a cost of about a quarter of a million dollars, 
and is probably to be ready for occupancy in October, 1905. 
This new building will not only add greatly to the facili- 
ties of the departments of Mining and Metallurgy, 
which will occupy it, but it will free space in the En- 
gineering Building and in Havemeyer that can be most 
profitably used by the other departments under the Faculty 
of Applied Science.

IV.—THE SCHOOL OF ARCHITECTURE 
THE five years from 1876 to 1881 constituted a period 
memorable in the annals of American progress. Peace, 
prosperity, and growing wealth were developing new tastes 
and furnishing the opportunity and means for a new 
artistic activity, for which the Centennial Exhibition at 
Philadelphia had prepared the way. Museums and 
schools of art were multiplied, and the tide which carries 
so many Americans to Paris to-day was beginning to make 
itself felt. The only schools of architecture in the country 
at this time were that of the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology at Boston, founded by Professor William R. 
Ware in 1866; that of Cornell University, founded in 
1871 by Professor Charles Babcock ; and that of the Ili- 
nois Industrial University, as it was then called, at Cham- 
paign, Illinois. The founder of the last school, Professor 
N. Clifford Ricker, is still at its head, and it is a striking 
illustration of how recent is the development of profes- 
sional education in architecture in the United States, that 
the founders of all three schools are still living. 
But these three schools, two of them in rural towns, 
remote from the great centres of architectural interest, 
were quite unable to supply the growing demand for trained 
architects and draughtsmen. Accordingly in 1880 the 
Trustees of Columbia College, as this University was then 
called, began to consider the advisability of establishing 
a truly metropolitan school of architecture in connection 
with the so-called School of Mines— the present Faculty 
of Applied Science. Mr. F. A. Schermerhorn was the 
leading advocate among the Trustees of such a school. 
Against the hesitation of his more timid colleagues he 
381 
   
-P-A-G-E-478
   882 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1880 brought to bear his own enthusiasm, pointing out the 
growing dignity and importance of architecture and the 
splendid opportunity before them to supply a real and 
urgent need. That the proposed school should be at- 
tached to the technological and: scientific faculty known 
as the School of Mines was accepted as a foregone con- 
clusion. This decision was probably the only one which 
would have made the school of architecture possible ; the 
conception of a broadly organized faculty of fine arts under 
the University was far beyond the scope of the plans of 
those days. Mathematics and science enter so largely 
into the work of the trained architect that it was at least 
highly convenient to attach the new school to a faculty 
which was already offering efficient instruction in these 
branches. Accordingly the new school was launched as 
a course or department of the School of Mines. 
At this time Professor Ware, who had founded, and for 
fifteen years had been the head of, the school of architec- 
ture of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, had 
but recently resigned his chair in that institution to de- 
vote himself to the active practice of his profession in 
Boston. As the founder and director of the first and 
most important American school of architecture, combin- 
ing in his own person the finest intellectual and artistic 
culture of New England with a wide professional and 
educational experience, he was clearly the one best quali- 
fied to undertake the heavy but inspiring task of building 
up the new school, and the Trustees invited him in 1881 
to assume the duties of professor of architecture in the 
Columbia School of Mines. The invitation was accepted 
by Professor Ware, upon the express stipulation that he 
should have an absolutely free hand in organizing the school 
and in conducting its affairs during its earlier and forma- 
tive years. It is evidence of the far-seeing liberality of 
the Trustees that they acceded to these conditions, so that 
Professor Ware was wholly untrammelled in carrying out

THE SCHOOL OF ARCHITECTURE 383 
his ideas and giving to the new school the character he 1881 
wished it to have; except, of course, so far as its subordi- 
nation to a scientific faculty imposed restrictions which 
could not be escaped. 
The new school of architecture was opened in the fall 
of 1881 with four students, in a gloomy, shabby upper 
room in the ancient building, known in its later years as 
the “ Maison de Punk,” on the College property at 49th 
Street, between Madison and Fourth avenues. Dur- 
ing the first year Professor Ware had no assistants, and 
as the studies of the course were largely mathematical 
and scientific, and the students few, it was not, perhaps, 
difficult for Professor Ware to give without aid the pro- 
fessional instruction required. Thus the school was not 
only Professor Ware’s school, so far as it was an archi- 
tectural school, it was chiefly Professor Ware himself. 
This personal character of the school, the close and inti- 
mate relations which were cultivated between master and 
pupil, and the dominance of Professor Ware’s individu- 
ality marked the school, not only during its infancy, but 
throughout the whole twenty-two years of his connection 
with it. It was, no doubt, one of its most valuable assets. 
In the fall of 1882 the writer of this sketch was in- 
vited to assist Professor Ware in the preparation of 
material for lectures on the history of ornament, and 
later to deliver the lectures. Thus began a connection 
with the school which has continued for twenty-two 
years, during twenty-one of which the writer was asso- 
ciated with Professor Ware successively as assistant, in- 
structor, and adjunct professor. For some time the courses 
administered by these two were supplemented by lectures 
given by special lecturers under temporary appointment. 
Other members were, however, added to the staff as time 
went on, until in 1898 there were nine persons giving 
instruction in the school, comprising one professor, two 
 
-P-A-G-E-480
   1884 adjunct professors, an instructor, and two “lecturers” 
   384 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
. 
giving their whole time, and a tutor, an instructor, and a 
“lecturer” giving partial time, to the school. 
In 1883 a new wing was completed for the School of 
Mines, and the Department of Architecture moved into 
new quarters on its fourth floor, which seemed palatial by 
contrast to the gloomy and shabby rooms under the roof 
of the Ionic portico of the antiquated “ Maison de Punk.” 
The first class of five members was graduated in 1884, and 
under more favorable conditions the school increased with 
great rapidity in numbers as well as in efficiency. Its 
equipment, for which the new rooms afforded for the first 
time proper accommodation, was rapidly enriched by a 
series of generous gifts from Mr. F. A. Schermerhorn, and 
it was especially well supplied with books, photographs, 
and slides, wall-diagrams, and a fine series of drawings 
from the Ecole des Beaux-Arts at Paris, which were framed 
and hung in the rooms “ pour encourager les autres.” These 
drawings were the despair as well as the inspiration of 
the earlier students. It was hard to believe that such 
artistic proficiency was within their reach ; and, indeed, 
it was not attainable in the four years’ course as it then 
was, though some of the drawings seem antiquated now, 
even to the undergraduate. Times and conditions have 
changed, and when one sets the best work of the last 
graduating class beside that of the class of ’84 or ’85 or 
even ’90, one obtains a measure of the progress of the 
school since then. 
In 1881 the first year students in architecture had no 
architecture at all. Their time was wholly taken up with 
mathematical and scientific studies in common with the 
students of engineering and chemistry. Very early, 
however, Professor Ware began that, process of gradual 
sundering of the ties that bound architecture to the 
schools of science, and I well remember the triumph we 
felt when, for the first time, the first year students began

coming to us for the second half of the year. On the 1801 
first day some twenty of them poured into the draughting 
room, headed by a very fresh, curly-headed youth who 
announced very decidedly that they were “the archi- 
tects,” —a statement whose confusion of the in posse with 
the in esse was the occasion of many gibes from the upper 
classmen. The next year we got our hands on the young 
men from the first day of their first year; and thereafter, 
little by little, the chemistry and physics, the botany and 
hygiene, the sanitary engineering and the economic geol- 
ogy, which had consumed many hours a week through all 
the years of the course, were crowded out or dropped, 
and the time thus gained devoted to drawing and design, 
to specifications and building materials. 
‘A still more radical change, and one even more strongly 
opposed. in the faculty meetings, was finally consummated 
by Professor Ware in 1891. This was to take over into 
the school (or department, as it then was) all the mathe- 
matics of the course, hitherto administered by the Depart- 
ment of Mathematics of the School of Mines. The object 
was to reduce the time devoted to mathematics by special- 
izing the instruction, omitting much that was irrelevant 
to architecture, though essential to the discipline of the 
engineers. Mr. Frank Dempster Sherman, a member of 
the first class graduated from the department, and a 
mathematician of singular clearness of mind, was made 
instructor in architectural engineering (as the mathe- 
matics of the course was collectively called), and later 
adjunct professor of architecture ; and by him has been 
given for thirteen years all the instruction in analytics, 
calculus, analytical mechanics, descriptive geometry, 
and shades and shadows. Successive classes have testified 
to the efficiency of his training and the remarkable clear- 
ness of his explanations. If the students of architecture 
covered less ground than the engineers, they had their 
mathematics at least as well in hand; some said better.

1891 The conflict waged over these changes, which were not effected without vigorous opposition, indicates the position 
itecture in those days held in the minds of en generally. It was an inferior, nondescript branch of| engineering, involving a smattering of several sciences, but exhaustive in none. The professors of chem- istry, geology, and botany each felt that more, not less of the architectural students’ time should be devoted to his pactideda roa of science, and looked upon a profession which sought to cut down his own share in its training as a sort of mongrel among the thoroughbreds. That it is an art, primarily and fundamentally dealing with plastic form, light, shadow, and color from the point of view of beauty, and that all its scientific connections and attach- ments were only means to artistic ends, subordinate always to the great aims of artistic plastic design, — this was a conception |quite foreign to their ideas, and they could not at first grasp it. But Professor Ware saw clearly the end he had set before him, and with the greatest good nature, 
simplicity, th clearness made known from time to time    
   
     
         
     
    
   
   
        
    
    
     
      
        
    
         the changes he desired, and one after another secured them. The scientists sometimes shrugged their shoulders, and sometimes protested ; but with the largeness of mind of the true scientist who recognizes the specialist in other fields than his own, they always ended by voting the changes. But it must not be thought that in dropping out the general] chemistry, physics, hygiene, and botany from the course, it was intended to ignore these subjects in the architectural training offered by the school. Two new and et courses were organized into which all these subje¢ts, thus dropped: as distinct studies, entered more or less largely. To these courses the titles of Speci- fications and Building Materials were given, and under them the chemistry and geology, the constitution and physical properties, the production and preservation, the growth and) decay, and the proper use of and methods of

specifying all the chief materials of construction were 1891 
treated in lectures and other exercises. Mr. Charles P. 
Warren, a graduate of the class of 1890, was engaged as 
tutor in architectural construction, to conduct this double 
course, which he has made unique in its conciseness, 
thoroughness, and (if I may coin a word) its up-to-date- 
ness. I know of nothing so efficient and complete in 
any other school, even disregarding the small total num- 
ber of hours it occupies in the course. 
I have spoken of the mathematics and their transfer to 
Professor Sherman’s hands in the Department of Architec- 
ture. Following the same principle of concentration and 
specialization, Professor Ware secured the similar transfer 
of the work in descriptive geometry and stereotomy, in 
graphical statics and strength of materials, so far as the 
students of architecture were concerned, from the hands 
of the engineering instructors to those of special instruc- 
tors in the Department of Architecture, Professor Sherman 
taking the descriptive geometry and stereotomy, while Mr. 
G. T. Snelling, a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology and a returned student of the Beaux-Arts 
in Paris, undertook the graphical statics and strength 
of materials. These were woven into a new course of 
architectural engineering, in which the theoretical discus- 
sions of applied mechanics were reduced to a minimum, 
and their applications to architecture especially insisted 
upon and discussed in a series of problems, partly of origi- 
nal design, covering all the typical cases of the post, lintel, 
arch, truss, vault, and retaining wall. This has also been. 
developed into a remarkably thorough and efficient course 
of fundamental value to the practitioner in New York 
under modern conditions. 
The historical and critical side of the architect’s training 
Professor Ware regarded as of fundamental importance, 
and it was developed in the Columbia school and has

   1891 always been maintained, upon lines which reveal the edu- 
cational resourcefulness and discernment of their author. 
The hist ry of styles and constructive systems was made 
a means of both professional and intellectual culture, by 
courses of illustrated lectures occupying three years and 
covering the ancient, medieval, and Renaissance periods 
and styles, with parallel courses on the history of ornament. 
But since no mere lecturé course can supply the discipline 
of individual research, or bring the student into intimate 
acquaintance with both the monuments themselves and 
the literature which treats of them, Professor Ware de- 
vised the highly efficient system of exercises in historical 
research which has ever since distinguished the Colum- 
bia course in architecture. In the second and third 
years the afternoons of six weeks of she second term are 
devoted to a sort of seminar in the library, each student 
being given a special topic for the week, with references 
to important works, and being required to prepare a 
written report upon it, with abundant illustrations — 
tracings, wash-drawings, pencil and pen sketches, or plans 
and elevations. This sort of study not only exercises him 
in composition and draughtsmanship ; it compels him to 
resort to the books and to learn the aspect of the great 
monuments of the various styles ; he becomes acquainted 
with what, in the lectures, were hardly more than names, 
and studies them as he never would were the required 
work less definitely planned and organized for him. 
But all this work — mathematical, scientific, structural, 
and historical —is preliminary to the work in drawing 
and design. The object of the course is not to produce 
mathematicians and engineers, but to train architects, 
designers of buildings, artists in structural form. The 
work thus far described is scientific, precise, intellectual ; 
the object of the training in design is artistic, and the 
vehicle of artistic expression is drawing. This depart- 
ment of work was the weakest side of the Columbia course
-P-A-G-E-487
  THE SCHOOL OF ARCHITECTURE 389 
in its early years, and the reason is obvious. The position 1891 
of the School of Architecture as a mere department of a 
school of science kept it under the domination of the 
scientific ideas and ideals which rightly controlled the 
Departments of Chemistry, Mining, and Engineering. 
The artistic side of the architect’s education was wholly 
overshadowed by this scientific environment, and scant 
time was allowed in the curriculum for either the draw- 
ing or the design. Moreover, the buildings on 49th 
Street and Fourth Avenue contained no suitable north- 
lighted room for drawing from the cast and from life, and 
the wonder is that without a drawing-room or casts, the 
students should have acquired the marked proficiency 
which they did in drawing. Intelligent methods and 
ingenious exercises devised by Professor Ware and by 
those under him in part made up for the woful deficien- 
cies in equipment in this department. 
The instruction in design was after the first year for a 
long time in the hands of the writer, who did what he could 
with the scanty allotment of hours at his disposal. Little 
by little this allotment was increased, and as the num- 
ber of students also grew, the work became more and 
more interesting by the emulation of numbers. From 
the first the extraneous stimulus of awards and prizes, 
indeed, of all competitive honors, was excluded. Profes- 
sor Ware believed that the enthusiasm of competition for 
honors was too often factitious, selfish, and hollow, aiming 
to reach superficial standards, and accompanied by evils: 
greater than the gain. He argued that true enthusiasm 
should spring from the inherent interest of the work, and 
to a considerable degree justified his argument by the 
results. The school also refused to be carried away by 
undiscriminating admiration for the methods of the Paris 
Hoole des Beaux- Arts, though seeking always to profit by 
its excellences so far as they could be adapted to our 
methods and ideas. Moreover, draughtsmanship was . 
 
-P-A-G-E-488
  390 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1894 always treated as secondary. to design, and detail to com- 
position. Professor Ware cared little for brilliant and 
showy drawings as results of the work in design, but a 
great deal for evidence of serious study, intelligent 
thought, sound knowledge and refined taste, and believed 
that these could often be as well shown in a brown-paper 
study as in an elaborately rendered drawing. This had 
its drawbacks, for the public made unfavorable compari- 
sons between the work of the Columbia men and the more 
attractive and finished displays of other schools, and it 
became necessary to show that Columbia students could 
“render” artistically as well as compose an effective 
design. Mr. Snelling, more recently from Paris than Mr. 
Hamlin, was accordingly given the third year work in 
design ; and in 1894, his time being too much taken up 
with his growing private practice to continue this work, 
it was intrusted, together with the more elementary 
second year design, to Mr. W. T. Partridge, a former 
student in the school who had later won the Rotch Schol- 
arship and spent some years in Paris. Professor Hamlin 
continued to administer the fourth year design, but in 
1898 he was given an assistant in the person of Mr. H. F. 
Hornbostel, of the class of 1891, a brilliant designer, since 
noted as the architect of the new East River bridges, who 
for five years efficiently conducted the actual work of in- 
struction and criticism in the advanced design. 
In 1889-1891 the School received two important gifts in 
the establishment of the Columbia and McKim Traveling 
Fellowships, the first founded by the Trustees in recogni- 
tion of Mr. Schermerhorn’s generous gifts to the school ; 
and the second endowed by Mr. C. F. McKim. These 
fellowships are awarded in alternate years to graduates of 
the School under thirty years of age, upon a competition 
in design, and the winner is required to devote the income 
to foreign travel and study. These benefactions have 
been of great value both in their influence on the under- 
 
-P-A-G-E-489
THE SCHOOL OF ARCHITECTURE 391 
graduate design and in the opportunity provided for 1897 
capable young men to secure the advantages of post-grad- 
uate study abroad. A fourth traveling fellowship, avail- 
able every fourth year, was established in 1898 by the 
bequest of the late Willard B. Perkins. 
Meanwhile the persistent pressure exerted by Profes- 
sor Ware had gradually forced out of the curriculum, 
as already related, many subjects and courses that seemed 
superfluous or irrelevant, and the whole curriculum 
had been revised and condensed, as it were, giving to 
design and drawing more nearly the time and attention 
they deserved. Particularly the fourth year had been in 
great part freed of lectures, and as far as possible devoted 
wholly to drawing and design. The fourth year men 
took more and more the rank and standing of postgradu- 
ate students, and their work in design gained proportion- 
ately in quality and amount. 
Thus by 1897 the school of architecture had secured a 
place by itself under the Faculty of Applied Science, and 
had become an independent school, save for its adminis- 
trative connection with that faculty. It stood also alone 
among the schools of architecture of the United States in 
its delivery from what Professor Ware was wont to call 
“the tyranny of mathematics ” as taught to engineers and 
professional scientists, and in the degree of its emancipa- 
tion from the dictation of a scientific faculty. It admin- 
istered a course of architectural training not yet ideally 
perfect, but in the main well balanced and sound, the full 
value of which did not always appear until three or four 
years after graduation. Men from other schools were 
sometimes accounted in the down-town offices the supe- 
riors of the Columbia draughtsmen, but a few years of 
professional experience generally served to bring out 
the underlying soundness and breadth of the Columbia 
training and its superiority as an equipment for the real 
career of the architect. And it was noticed that in post- 
 
-P-A-G-E-490
392 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
  1897 graduate competitions and in the work done by the 
American students in Paris, the Columbia men took at 
least their full share of honors. 
By the time, then, that the school moved to its new quar- 
ters on the heights of Morningside, it stood in the front 
rank among American schools. Its numbers had risen from 
the five of 1881-1883 to 53 in 1887, 76 in 1899, and 96 in 
1897, making it at that time the largest school in the 
country. Its staff had increased from one professor in 
1881-1882 to eight members in 1897, — one professor, two 
adjunct professors, and five instructors bearing various 
titles (curator, instructor, tutor, assistant, lecturer). The 
new quarters were as marked an improvement over the 
old ones on 49th Street as these—long outgrown and 
overcrowded—had been over the dingy room in the 
“Maison de Punk.” Light, air, space, and deliverance 
from the noise of the railway on Fourth Avenue, — these 
alone were a great boon. But in addition there was found 
room for a fine departmental library and a well-lighted 
exhibition hall, and for the proper display of the building 
materials and appliances collected by Professor Ware 
and Mr. C. P. Warren, and the fine collection of casts 
presented in 1891 by Mr. C. F. McKim. In addition there 
was provided for the first time a fairly suitable room for 
drawing from the cast and from life, and the course in 
drawing profited accordingly. The favorable results of 
the transfer to these new and attractive quarters began to 
manifest themselves at once in an improved tone and 
spirit in the student body, and a very perceptible advance 
in the quality and amount of their work. 
In 1902 the Trustees, upon the suggestion of President 
Butler, consummated the liberation of the School of Archi- 
tecture from a connection with the Schools of Applied 
Science which had for some years been little more than 
nominal. Together with the Department of Music it was
-P-A-G-E-491
THE SCHOOL OF ARCHITECTURE 393 
set apart from all connection with other faculties to be 1902 
administered by its own staff under the President, as an 
independent school, until such time as it should be possi- 
ble to organize definitely a Faculty and School of Fine 
Arts, with the Departments of Music and Architecture as 
anucleus. This was a step of far-reaching importance. 
It crowned the long-continued efforts of Professor Ware 
and of the writer to place the School of Architecture upon 
the footing of a school of art, not science, and left it free 
to carve out for itself its own educational destiny. The 
final consummation of this long process will come with 
the creation of the promised Faculty and School of Fine 
Arts, in which this school may take its rightful place. 
Under these new conditions the registration of the school 
has again moved upward, attaining, during the year just 
elapsed, nearly or quite the highest number in its history. 
During twenty-two of the twenty-three years of that 
history, the school was under the direction of its founder, 
while the presidential chair of the University had been 
occupied by three different men. Each of these had in 
turn manifested a deep and intelligent interest in the 
Department of Architecture. Founded under the late 
Dr. F. A. P. Barnard, the department had, under President 
Low, become part of a great university. President Low 
assumed office in 1889, and began at once his remark- 
able reorganization and consolidation of the faculties 
which he found loosely grouped under the general name 
of Columbia College. In 1896 the consolidated institu- 
tion assumed the name of Columbia University ; the old 
School of Mines became the Faculty of Applied Science, 
and the Department of Architecture took its proper place 
and title as the School of Architecture under that Faculty. 
Thus was the school at last mercifully delivered from the 
misleading and absurd title of Department of Architecture 
of the School of Mines. 
In 1901 President Low resigned from the presidency of 
 
-P-A-G-E-492
  894 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1902 the University to reénter political life, and Professor 
Nicholas Murray Butler was elected President of the 
University. It was very early in his incumbency of 
this office that he began to work for the separation of the 
school from the Faculty of Applied Science. The first sug- 
gestion looking toward such a step appears to have been 
a letter published in the Quarterly for September, 1901, 
from the pen of Professor Hamlin; but the precise nature 
of the first step to be taken was first outlined in verbal and 
written suggestions made by Professor E. A. MacDowell 
of the Department of Music, urging immediate action, 
supplemented by a communication from Professor Ware, 
embodying at length his views as to the organization of the 
proposed Fine Arts Faculty. The Trustees took action 
in May, 1902, upon a letter received from the President 
recommending the setting off of the Departments of Archi- 
tecture and Music, and the separation took effect July 1 of 
that year. 
In June, 1903, Professor Ware laid down the burden of 
responsibility so long and ably borne, and was made Pro- 
fessor Emeritus by the Trustees, who in making the 
appointment adopted the following minute : — 
On the occasion of the retirement of William R. Ware as 
Professor Emeritus of Architecture, the Trustees desire to 
place on record this expression of their appreciation of his 
personal worth as well as of his high professional skill and 
long and successful academic service. It has been given to 
Professor Ware to organize two successful schools of architec- 
ture, and that at Columbia University, which his hand has 
guided from its earliest beginnings, will remain as an enduring 
monument of his foresight and zealous skill. The Trustees 
wish for Professor Ware many years of health and happiness 
in the enjoyment of the dignity which he has so fully earned. 
Professor Ware has carried with him into his charming 
home at Milton, Massachusetts, the warm affection of nearly 
two hundred graduates and as many non-graduate former 
 
-P-A-G-E-493

students in architecture to whom he was always more like 1903 
a father, or a friend and counselor, than a pedagogue. His 
personal influence upon his pupils was always one of the 
strongest of educative forces, and nothing else can quite 
take its place. Upon his retirement the administration 
of the school temporarily devolved upon the writer, as act- 
ing head. The future will show what is to be its devel- 
opment and destiny. 
The record of the school in the profession is an honor- 
able one. Of the first graduated class of five, three are 
professors in schools of architecture, F. D. Sherman at 
Columbia, I. Nolan at Philadelphia, A. C. Nye? at Pratt 
Institute. The other two, Messrs. Little and O’Connor, 
constitute a firm whose professional achievements and rep- 
utation stand very high. Graduates of the school are or 
have been teachers of architecture at Chicago, Champaign 
(illinois), Philadelphia, and the University of Missouri. 
A number of firms of the very highest standing are com- 
posed of alumni of this school, while not a few graduates 
are doing important work in offices on whose letter-heads 
their names do not appear. There is always a large 
colony of recent Columbia graduates in the Ecole at Paris, 
and they stand uniformly high. Most of them return 
to the United States less carried away than are many of 
their fellow-students in Paris by the traditions of the 
Paris school, of which they reap the full benefit without 
sacrificing their American predilections or trying to for- 
get their American training. 
A word should be said about the special students. In 
1890 for the first time the doors were opened to students 
not candidates for a degree, and they were admitted with- 
1 Since the above was written, news has been received of the sudden 
death of Professor Nye —the first break in the ranks of the first class to 
graduate in architecture at Columbia, and a most regrettable loss to Pratt 
Institute and to the profession. 
 
-P-A-G-E-494

1890 out examination upon giving evidence of maturity and a 
   fair amount of professional experience. Over a hundred 
such students have spent longer or shorter terms in the 
school, and not a few among them have eventually com- 
pleted all the requirements for the bachelor’s degree and 
graduated as regular students. Among the remainder 
there are many who have received from their studies at 
Columbia a new inspiration as well as a new equipment 
for their professional careers ; who are proud of their 
connection with the Columbia School, and grateful for 
what it has given them. Such men are often among the 
most loyal advocates and supporters of the school, increas- 
ing its reputation and giving it the credit of their success. 
The profession gains by the labors of such men, as truly 
as by that of those who, with greater opportunities in 
their early training, have taken the full course and won 
the bachelor’s degree. It has been abundantly proved 
that such men can be encouraged to enter the school with- 
out in any way lowering its standards. The Columbia 
degree in architecture represents to-day a broader and 
fuller and higher professional training than it did when 
special students were first admitted in 1890.

THE AFFILIATED COLLEGES 
I.—BARNARD COLLEGE 
BARNARD CoLuzGE, which cares for the undergraduate 
women students of Columbia University, is appropriately 
named in honor of President Frederick A. P. Barnard, under 
whose administration Columbia College was metamor- 
phosed into a modern university. In 1879, when he had reached the age of seventy, and had long passed the period 
of life when the average mind gives free admittance to new ideas, President Barnard, in his annual report to the 
Trustees of Columbia College, submitted some reasons 
why the institution should permit young women to profit 
from the educational facilities it afforded. This was one 
year after the founding of what is now Radcliffe College, 
four years after the opening of Wellesley and the founding 
of Smith, six years after the opening of Girton, fourteen 
after the effective organization of Vassar, and practically 
contemporaneous with the purchase of the land upon 
which Bryn Mawr is built. 
In his advocacy of collegiate coeducation — for this was 
what President Barnard, with his sense for logic and 
economy, and above all his grasp upon American ten- 
dencies and ideals, really wished to establish — the great 
educator was in adyance of the community in which he lived, and, in consequence, of the Trustees to whom he 
made his recommendations. No serious attention was 
397
-P-A-G-E-496
  398 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1883 given to his proposals, but he continued to make them, 
spurred on by his conviction of the justice of the main 
cause he had at heart, and doubtless exhilarated by the 
joy of the only rational form of aggressive combat — that 
for ideals against prejudices. In the short space of four 
years he succeeded in arousing public interest in his 
project to such an extent that a well-signed petition was 
presented to the Trustees of the College, asking the 
admission of women students on equal terms with the men 
at that time enjoying the privileges of the chief metro- 
politan institution of learning. 
To this petition the Trustees replied in three resolutions. 
The first and second stated what the Board thought it 
should not and could not do in the premises. The third 
stated what the Board thought it could do, and this 
resolution, being positive, not negative in character, and 
belonging to the history of achievement rather than to 
that of opinion, is of sufficient importance to warrant 
quotation in full : — 
“ Resolved, That this Board deem it expedient to insti- 
tute measures for raising the standard of female education 
by proposing courses of study to be pursued outside the 
College, but under the observation of its authorities, and 
offering suitable academic honors and distinctions to any 
who, on examination, shall be found to have pursued such 
courses of study with success.” 
Neither the substance nor the language of this resolu- 
tion can have satisfied President Barnard or the petitioners. 
The Trustees had given their venerable President less 
than the proverbial half-loaf, and it was apparently due 
to no special scrutiny of theirs that the ostensible bread 
offered in such exiguous quantity did not turn out to 
be a fragment of stone. As a later Dean of Barnard, 
Mrs. George Haven Putnam, admirably puts it: The 
President’s “ardent wish was to give young women an 
education ; ‘suitable academic honors’ were not his chief
-P-A-G-E-497
BARNARD COLLEGE 899 
desideratum. But the Trustees said in effect: We are 1884 not prepared to educate girls; if, however, they can con- trive to educate themselves, we will certify the fact.” 1 But almost before the Trustees were aware of it, some- 
body had builded better than they knew. The President's 
report for 1884, the year following the petition, stated that six women had taken advantage of the privileges offered by the resolution just quoted. This meant the inauguration of a “Collegiate Course for Women,” which under existing arrangements was bound to prove nonde- script and unsatisfactory, but which served very well the purposes of a wedge. Both the women who took the course and the teachers who conducted it were interested in having it superseded by something more orderly and dignified ; the former because of the difficulties, the defi- 
ciencies, and the lack of adequate external incentives 
attending their studies; the latter because of the dispro- portion between the responsibilities devolved upon them and their facilities for proper academic supervision. After a few degrees had been taken, the advocates of the move- 
ment for the higher education of women in New York City and its environs perceived that they must have an institution of their own in which the necessary teaching could be done; but they were too wise to let slip the advantages of the hold which the « Collegiate Course for Women” gave them upon the rapidly expanding Columbia. They already held the heart of the citadel, while its gal- 
lant, if somewhat obtuse, defenders scarcely realized that 
more than a few slight sallies had been made against it. A college for men with a long and honorable past — nay more, a swiftly developing metropolitan university — had pledged itself to give its degrees to properly qualified women, had already kept its promise in half a dozen cases,

1889 and was in duty bound to safeguard those degrees in the 
most effective and least harassing fashion. If this, on 
account of local sentiment, could not mean undergraduate 
coeducation, it did mean, in the light of the experi- 
ence of the Harvard Annex, the teaching of women appli- 
ecants for degrees by the same masculine instructors for 
the most part that taught the young men in Columbia 
College. The need for economy and academic ideals of 
training, to say nothing of the sense for fair play, made 
full coéperation between the two teaching institutions 
inevitable, while the fact that the older institution con- 
ferred all the degrees given differentiated the younger 
from the colleges for women that had previously grown 
up under the protection or rather in the shadow of long 
established educational foundations for men. In other 
words, if Columbia either could not or would not range 
herself with the great western coeducational Universities, 
she was estopped by the niggardly but honorably kept 
resolution of her Trustees from ranging herself with 
Cambridge and Harvard as a promoter of the annex idea, 
whether in name or in substance. 
In 1889, the year of President Barnard’s death and 
just a decade after his memorable report, the following 
persons, who had previously secured the sanction of the 
Columbia Trustees for their plans, obtained a provisional 
charter as Trustees of Barnard College ; Mrs. Francis B. 
Arnold, Rev. Dr. Arthur Brooks, Miss Helen Dawes 
Brown, Silas B. Brownell, Mrs. William C. Brownell, 
Mrs. Joseph H. Choate, Frederic R. Coudert, Noah 
Davis, George Hoadley, Hamilton Wright Mabie, Mrs. 
Alfred Meyer, George A. Plimpton, Mrs. John D. Rocke- 
feller, Jacob H. Schiff, Francis Lynde Stetson, Mrs. James 
S. T. Stranahan, Mrs. James Talcott, Rev. Dr. Henry Van 
Dyke, Miss Ella Weed, Everett P. Wheeler, Miss Alice 
Williams, and Mrs. William Wood.

serving the College in the same capacity. Of those whose 1894 
connection with the Board has been severed either through 
resignation or by death, two should be specially recalled. 
One, the Rev. Arthur Brooks, rector of the Church of the 
Incarnation and brother of the late Bishop of Massachu- 
setts, was the first chairman of the Trustees and until his 
death the main link between the College and the public. 
The other, Miss Ella Weed, was chairman of the academic 
committee of the Board and practically served the College 
as executive head or Dean until her death in 1894. She 
succeeded through her wisdom and tact in so conducting 
the administration of the College that its relations with 
Columbia were strengthened, while at the same time she 
helped the institution to maintain high standards without 
forfeiting the sympathy of the community through appar- 
ent exclusiveness. A scholarship and the Ella Weed 
Reading Room commemorate her indispensable pioneer 
labors. It may not be invidious to mention in connec- 
tion with these deceased benefactors two of the present 
Trustees whose services to Barnard date from its founda- 
tion and have been specially valuable. One is Mr. George 
A. Plimpton, the Treasurer of the Board. The other is 
Mrs. Alfred Meyer, one of the students under the early 
“Collegiate Course for Women,” whose experience of its 
deficiencies made her exceptionally eager to secure for the 
women of New York the advantages of the fullest uni- 
versity training. 
For it was this and not merely collegiate training that 
the connection of Barnard with Columbia really involved. 
After the election of Mr. Seth Low to the Presidency of 
Columbia, the evolution of the conservative old college 
into a great university went forward in a startling man- 
ner. This meant among other things a large increase in 
the teaching staff available for both Columbia College 
and Barnard, and a corresponding gain in the quality of 
the instruction offered. It meant also encouragement to 
2D

1894 ambitious undergraduates to pursue special studies for 
the higher degrees. It meant access to a larger library, 
to better equipped laboratories, to more numerous and 
finer museums and galleries than any strictly collegiate 
institution, whether for men or for women, could furnish. 
It meant, finally, all that is included in that indefinite but 
very significant phrase, “ university atmosphere.” 
These advantages were not, of course, entirely available 
to the students of Barnard when the College began its 
work at No. 348 Madison Avenue. The instruction offered 
to the classes entering during the first three years was 
identical, so far as it went, with that given at Columbia 
College, but there were only seven instructors, — a number 
sufficient, however, to deal with the fourteen regular and 
the twelve special students who were enrolled the first 
year. Each year saw more students and the need of more 
instructors, and the fourth year also brought with it the 
admission of some seniors into Columbia classrooms. 
Meanwhile the strictly University Faculties of Philosophy 
and Political Science had received permission to open their 
courses to auditors of either sex, and under the former 
Faculty Barnard students had secured the privilege of be- 
ing instructed and examined in numerous classes. Rela- 
tions with the latter Faculty were not established until 
1895, shortly before the removal to Morningside Heights 
was effected. The way to bridge the theoretical chasm was 
discovered to lie in Barnard’s guaranteeing the salaries of 
two new professors, in return for which the Faculty of 
Political Science furnished twelve hours of lectures per 
week to Barnard, a number of professors joining to give 
them. In mathematics a similar arrangement was made, 
and in 1898 the somewhat anomalous relations between 
Barnard and the Faculty of Pure Science were simplified 
and extended. The entire group of relations between 
Columbia and Barnard could at no juncture during this 
period have satisfied a mind with the slightest philosophical 
   
-P-A-G-E-503
BARNARD COLLEGE 403 
bent; but a fair uniformity of standards was maintained 1895 
and the younger institution was slowly preparing itself 
to become an integral and creditable part of the Univer- 
sity system. 
At the end of the fourth year eight students were 
graduated and the College had grown to the number of 
eighty-five in all classes. Expenses had been met by fees 
and by small annual donations, so that there were no 
debts; and $125,000 had been given for permanent uses, 
$100,000 of which was designed by its donor, Mrs. Van 
Wyck Brinckerhoff, to serve as a building fund. Such 
a fund was greatly needed in view of the fact that the 
removal of the University to a less cramped quarter of 
the city was becoming imperative. Barnard must move 
with Columbia, not only for the convenience of the teach- 
ing staff of the latter, but also because one of its functions 
was to register postgraduate women whose courses were 
taken under the strictly University Faculties. Before 
the change was made, however, the work of organization 
was greatly strengthened by the election in 1894 of Miss 
Emily Jane Smith as Dean. Miss Smith, who later be- 
came Mrs. George Haven Putnam, served the College 
until February, 1900,— in other words until the ratification 
of the important agreement of the month previous which 
gave Barnard its present standing in the University. 
In her report for the academic year 1894-1895, the new 
Dean could announce a total enrolment of one hundred 
and twenty-three students, the founding of several scholar- 
ships, the appointment of the new University professors 
already mentioned, and the selection of Dr. Emily A. 
Gregory to fill the chair of Botany —the first professor- 
ship in the College intrusted to a woman, but not to be 
long held on account of her regretted death. The next 
year showed a slight growth in numbers and twice the 
amount of subscriptions for the purchase of a new site. 
In 1897 the Dean could report not merely the approaching 
 
-P-A-G-E-504
   404 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1898 completion of two new buildings, Brinckerhoff and Mil- bank Halls, on the site purchased in the spring of 1896, but also the gift of funds sufficient to complete the group of buildings planned. Milbank Hall had been named in honor of the parents of its donor Mrs. A. A. Anderson ; the third building, intended for a dormitory, took its name, Fiske Hall, in honor of the husband of its donor 
Mrs. Josiah M. Fiske, now Mrs. George W. Collord. This year the total number of students was slightly in excess of two hundred, the growth in the regular arts course, however, not being conspicuous. In 1898, as Miss Smith remarked, the gain was “in the right place,” —to wit in the regular undergraduates and qualified postgraduates, 
not in the special and the music students. In the pre- ceding fall the College had opened in its new buildings, and the corner-stone of the dormitory had been laid. The Dean could also report the admission of women graduates to numerous courses in economics and history, and the establishment of mutually advantageous relations with Teachers College, whereby the students of Barnard could secure a professional teaching diploma at the time of their graduation, and women students of Teachers College could supplement their academic training. The next annual report announced several important gifts in money, the establishment of new scholarships, a good growth in regular and a decrease in irregular students, and a grati- fying development of college spirit and social life. In January, 1900, the more complete incorporation of the work of Barnard College with that of Columbia Univer- sity took place, and with this year the report of the Dean of Barnard ceased to be a separate publication and was issued along with the reports of the other Deans in Presi- dent Low’s Annual Report. The general effect of the agree- ments reached between the Trustees of Columbia College and those of Barnard and of Teachers College was well summed up by President Low in the following sentences: — 
    
-P-A-G-E-505
  BARNARD COLLEGE 405 
“New agreements have been made with Barnard College 1900 and with Teachers College, by which both of these corpo- rations, while retaining their separate existence, have become in fact as completely a part of the educational system of the University as though the work that they are doing were being carried on under the University char- ter... . Incidentally these agreements determine the relations of the University to the higher education of women and to the professional training of teachers in a way that cannot be otherwise than satisfactory to those who have these interests at heart. Barnard College becomes a separate college for women, having its own Faculty which controls the instruction leading to the degree of Bachelor of Arts. This degree is conferred by the University upon the women who graduate from Barnard College, in the same way and upon the same conditions as it is conferred by the University upon the men who graduate from Columbia College. ~The rela- tion of Barnard College to the University Council, and, through it, to the educational policy of the University, 
is in substance the same as the relation of Columbia 
College. On the other hand women who have taken the final degree will hereafter become candidates for the degrees of Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy 
as students of the University itself, instead of, as hereto- fore, as graduate students of Barnard College.” 
Special features of the agreement were that the Presi- 
dent of the University should be ex-officio President of 
Barnard College and a member of its Board of Trustees ; 
that the internal administration of the College should be 
in the hands of a Dean appointed by the President of the 
University with the consent of the Trustees of Barnard ; 
that Barnard should be represented in the University 
Council by its Dean, and, after it should maintain ten or 
more members of its Faculty, by an elected representative ; 
that officers of instruction nominated and maintained by 
Barnard should be appointed by the University and should 
have a standing “the same in all respects as that of the 
like officers in the University”; that for the services
-P-A-G-E-506
  406 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1900 rendered the University by these officers an equivalent 
should be rendered to Barnard by other officers of the 
University of like grade; that on and after July 1, 1904, 
all the courses of instruction for women leading to the 
degree of Bachelor of Arts, with a few exceptions, should 
be given separately in Barnard College; that the Uni- 
versity would admit women candidates for the higher 
degrees as graduate students under the Faculties of Phi- 
losophy, Political Science, and Pure Science, on the same 
terms as men, to courses designated by those Faculties 
with the consent of the persons delivering them; that the 
University would confer its degree of Bachelor of Arts 
upon qualified students of Barnard College, the latter 
institution granting no degree ; and, finally, that Barnard 
College should retain its separate corporate existence and 
that its Trustees should continue to provide for its finan- 
cial support. 
It is needless to say that the gist of this compact, legally 
terminable but practically only subject to amendment, lay 
in Barnard’s securing University supervision and support, 
in the University’s growth in students and influence, and in 
the increase and improvement of the teaching force in both 
institutions. The struggle for the higher education of 
women in the city of New York and its vicinity begun 
by President Barnard had resulted in a decisive victory, 
more creditable to both sides than victories of opinion 
often are, and very acceptable to the community in the 
midst of which it was obtained. It was not, however, 
exactly the sort of victory the philosophical educator had 
hoped for, nor was it a complete one, since it is still pos- 
sible for an intelligent and reputable human being, simply 
because the accident of birth has made her a woman, to 
be denied advanced and specialized training in legitimate 
studies taught in Columbia University to mortals differ- 
ently attired. 
Lack of space renders it impossible to follow in detail
-P-A-G-E-507
  BARNARD COLLEGE 407 
the history of Barnard since its close union with Columbia 1904 
was effected. It must suffice to say that the wisdom of 
the agreement between the institutions has been made 
manifest, and to note a few facts of special interest. 
After Mrs. Putnam’s resignation in February, 1900, Pro- 
fessor James Harvey Robinson, of the Faculty of Political 
Science, acted as Dean, and carried the College over a 
critical period with great skill. The Faculty of Barnard 
College, as reorganized, held its first meeting on March 
15, 1900, and comprised, besides the President and the 
Acting Dean, fourteen professors and adjunct professors, 
nearly all of whom had previously served on one or more 
of the Columbia Faculties. The other officers of instruc- 
tion numbered nineteen. Four years later the Faculty 
comprised twenty-five professors and adjunct professors, 
and the other officers of instruction numbered thirty. In 
1900 there were one hundred and seventy-one undergrad- 
uate students; in 1904 the four classes formed a total 
of three hundred and thirty students in course. 
To fill Mrs. Putnam’s place with a woman of scholarly 
training and ideals and of exceptional executive ability 
was the first task that confronted the Trustees after the 
initial steps of reorganization had been taken. Their 
choice finally fell on Miss Laura Drake Gill, a graduate 
of Smith College, a student at many European universi- 
ties, a successful teacher of girls, and an experienced 
philanthropical worker in Cuba during and after the 
Spanish-American War. Miss Gill was formally installed 
as Dean on May 1, 1901, and her conduct of her difficult 
office has abundantly proved the wisdom of her appoint- 
ment. The year that gave Barnard a new Dean deprived 
Columbia of the services of President Low, who, by his 
interest in everything pertaining to the education of 
women, had shown himself worthy to be Dr. Barnard’s 
successor. His place was supplied, first temporarily then 
permanently, by Professor Nicholas Murray Butler. That
-P-A-G-E-508
  408 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1908 Barnard would receive all rights and more under the 
latter’s administration was a foregone conclusion, if only 
because of the spirit of fair play, the logical acumen, and 
the sense of practicality displayed by him in a short paper 
on “ The Education of Women,” contributed to the Colwm- 
bia University Quarterly for June, 1900. Since Dr. Butler’s 
inauguration Barnard has received two important bene- 
factions: one of $500,000, consequent upon Mr. John D. 
Rockefeller’s contingent gift of $250,000; the other of 
$1,000,000, from Mrs. A. A. Anderson, the donor of Mil- 
bank Hall. The latter gift took the form of the block of 
land fronting the College, and thus insured space for future 
expansion. That this will come is certain, both from the 
experience of the past few years and from the fact that 
the public of New York is being more and more made to 
see that Barnard is worthy, not only of Columbia’s adop- 
tion, but of the entire city’s pride and effective support. 
That it is worthy of the love of its students and graduates, 
and of all who have been privileged to contribute to its 
upbuilding, does not need to be affirmed.

   II.— TEACHERS COLLEGE 
THE development of Teachers College from its earliest 
form as an organization, covering a little less than a quar- 
ter-century, shows several clearly marked stages. It was 
at first a purely philanthropic organization designed to 
better the conditions of the poor by instructing girls in 
household economy, and boys in manual occupations. Its 
next step was the equipment and training of teachers of 
these subjects, and the dissemination of the growing belief 
in the educational importance of the training of the hand. 
From this stage it passed into the phase of training 
teachers, at first for all the work of the kindergarten and 
elementary schools, and afterward for high school teach- 
ing, principalships, and supervisory positions. Later it 
added, as a clear necessity, certain courses of a purely 
academic character, and so grew into an independent Col- 
lege with a four years’ course. During this stage of its 
evolution it came into contact with Columbia University, 
at first through a loose alliance, and later through an 
agreement that made it an integral part of the University. 
From the beginning it was guided and formed by men 
and women who saw in wise education the best form of 
philanthropy. And though it has now ceased to be classed 
among philanthropic institutions, in the more restricted 
sense of the term, its fundamental aim is still the same, — 
public service through the training of teachers. 
In 1880 a number of young women formed the Kitchen 
Garden Association. This, like other similar organiza- 
tions of the time, was an attempt at the solution of the 
difficulties of living on small incomes in large cities. 
Instruction was given in sewing, marketing, cooking, and 
409 
   
-P-A-G-E-512
410 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1884 other things incident to housekeeping. The success of 
its efforts and the cordiality with which they were re- 
ceived induced the Association after a few years to reor- 
ganize under a new and more inclusive name. In 1884, 
therefore, there was formed the Industrial Education 
Association, for the purpose of giving instruction not 
only in household matters for girls, but in the manual arts 
for boys. 
The headquarters of the new Association were at 21 
University Place. Among the officers were General 
A. S. Webb, President, Miss Grace H. Dodge (who had 
been a leader in the movement from the beginning), and 
Messrs. William F. Bridge and William A. Potter. 
Among the honorary members were President Barnard of 
Columbia and Mr. Seth Low, then Mayor of Brooklyn. 
There were in all about sixty working members besides 
the honorary and corresponding members. The Associa- 
tion had not contracted and centred its activities, but 
rather extended them along general lines, as is shown by 
its report in 1886. There were committees on “ Mechani- 
cal Industries,” on “Industrial Art,” on “ Plans for Out- 
side Organization,” on “ Vacation Schools,” on “ Industries 
for Reformatories,” on “Kindergartens,” a “Bureau of 
Teachers,” etc. This list indicates, not chaos, but only 
the indefiniteness inevitable in a new field, and the wide 
interests of public-spirited men and women. And much 
of the work was definite enough. Evening industrial 
schools for boys, classes in cooking and sewing for girls, 
a school for the training of domestic servants’ at 54 East 
11th Street, and the establishment of the first vacation 
schools in the city, were some of the achievements of the 
Association. 
Coincident with this period of its activities there was 
a growing interest throughout the country in manual 
training. Into this cause the founders of the Association 
put much thought and labor. In the spring of 1886 they 
 
-P-A-G-E-513
  TEACHERS COLLEGE 411 
held a public exhibition of children’s hand work, to which 1886 
at first the schools of New York and later the schools of 
other cities were asked to send specimens. The widespread 
attention which this exhibition received undoubtedly had 
great effect in advancing the general interest in this phase 
of education. From this time on the Association, and 
later the College, gave for a number of years so much 
prominence to the manual arts that only within recent 
years have some of its friends come to realize that it is 
not a technical institution. 
Within two or three years the demands made upon the 
Association, the success of its work, and the wisdom of its 
managers had brought them to see that they must commit 
themselves definitely to one line of work — that of train- 
ing teachers, not merely of hand work, but of the elemen- 
tary subjects in general. What had preceded this point 
was the process of germination; the final purpose was 
soon to appear. From the first, the importance of the 
teacher had been felt. The report of the Association for 
1881 declares that “the Association cannot be responsible 
for classes or schools taught by untrained teachers.” Prior 
to this, in 1858, President Barnard had proposed to the 
Trustees of Columbia University a scheme which included 
the science and art of education. And again in 1881 and 
1882 he had represented to the Trustees the importance of 
these things as university subjects. In 1886 he and his 
advisers had looked about for some means of realizing his 
desire of “a teachers’ college on a university basis.” Lead- 
ing educators, such as President Gilman, President Walker, 
Professor Butler, and others, had counselled the officers of 
the Association in this direction, and in 1887 the Asso- 
ciation chose as its President Professor Nicholas Murray 
Butler, not merely on account of his proved abilities, but 
for his special interest in the training of teachers. When, 
therefore, the Association was incorporated in 1889, as the 
New York College for the Training of Teachers, later
-P-A-G-E-514
  412 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1889 simplified to Teachers College, the organization that had 
already accomplished so much by its somewhat scattered 
yet earnest efforts, may be said to have found its definite 
purpose. Since that time all changes that have occurred 
have been made with reference to greater efficiency in the 
one object of training teachers. Higher requirements, 
both for entrance and graduation, more courses of study, 
more research work, and a due recognition of the claims 
of the subjects which entered later than the manual arts, 
have all been made in recognition of existing educational 
conditions. 
The College was now established at 9 University Place, 
the old building of the Union Theological Seminary. It 
was supported in part by tuition fees, but largely by the 
gifts of generous friends. Among these were prominent 
Miss Grace H. Dodge, Mrs. Peter M. Bryson, Mr. George 
W. Vanderbilt, and Mr. Spencer Trask. But much of the 
general interest in the work was shown in the large num- 
ber of small contributions. Under President Butler’s 
guidance the College now addressed itself definitely to the 
work of preparing teachers. Courses were offered in the 
history and theory of education, supplementary courses in 
art, manual training, and science were provided, a model 
school for the observation and practice of teaching was 
added, and, in general, the work followed the lines of the 
best existing normal schools. 
It soon became apparent, however, that the College must 
raise and unify its standards. Some of its students were 
well prepared for the work, others were immature and ill- 
informed. At first there had been practically no require- 
ment for admission except experience in teaching or earnest 
desire to teach. During the administration of President 
Walter L. Hervey, who succeeded President Butler in 
1891 and remained in office until 1897, the need of a higher 
academic standard became imperative. In 1893 there was 
introduced a definite course of one year of academic study
-P-A-G-E-515
TEACHERS COLLEGE 413 
for students who needed such instruction. A year later, 1893 
a-second year of such study was required of those who 
had the equivalent of a high-school course, as a prelimi- 
nary to the professional course of two years. Entrance 
to either the academic or professional courses was by ex- 
amination, by certificate, or by a diploma from normal 
school or college. By the time, therefore, that the College 
came to its new site on 120th Street, in 1894, it had in 
operation a four years’ course of study, two years of which 
were academic and consisted of science, history, English, 
and the manual arts, and two years of professional study 
in the history, theory, and art of education. 
The growth of the College and the Horace Mann School 
had been steady and rapid. The building at 9 University 
Place was badly overcrowded. Early in 1893 Mr. George 
W. Vanderbilt purchased the lots for the new site, only 
a few days before it was announced that Columbia had 
acquired its present location. Other large gifts followed 
rapidly : the Macy Manual Arts building, the Milbank 
Memorial building, the Macy Horace Mann School build- 
ing, the Frederick F. Thompson building for physical 
education, and the various plots of ground which comprise 
the block between 120th and 121st streets, from Amster- 
dam Avenue to the Boulevard. In addition to these more 
visible gifts, there have been yearly contributions ranging 
from $50,000 to $75,000 for the current expenses of the 
College, the establishment of scholarships, and the enrich- 
ment of the library generously founded and endowed by 
Mrs. Bryson. The College now has, as a result of this 
liberal giving, a library of about 30,000 volumes especially 
rich in its educational department, buildings and land 
worth over a million dollars, well-furnished and equipped 
lecture rooms, laboratories, and offices, and an endowment 
fund of a half million. This endowment, increased by the 
actual and conditional gifts of Mr. Rockefeller and others, 
will, it is hoped, soon reach a million. 
 
-P-A-G-E-516
414 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1897. While considering the material conditions of the College, 
mention must be made of its dormitories. The problem 
of housing its students had long been a difficult one. 
Two years ago friends of the College erected four large 
connecting buildings on Amsterdam Avenue, and equipped 
them in the most recent methods. They contain rooms 
and apartments for students, and apartments for families. 
Here, within easy reach of their work, reside most of the 
students of Teachers College and many of the students 
of Barnard College. 
The educational world has been in the past ten or 
fifteen years somewhat puzzled at recurring newspaper 
announcements that Teachers College had become a part 
of Columbia University. Part of this obscurity has been 
due to looseness of statement, and part to the fact of a 
gradual change from an indefinite alliance to a closer and 
more fixed union. As early as 1890 there existed an 
arrangement by which students enrolled in either institu- 
tion might elect certain designated courses in the other, 
and receive credit therefor at their own College. The 
range of choice was at first very narrow, and the nature of 
the contract between the Colleges fluctuating and uncer- 
tain. There were, however, from 1892 to 1898, always some 
graduate students of Columbia University in some of the 
regular courses of Teachers College. Plans for a closer 
union had been discussed during the latter end of Presi- 
dent Hervey’s administration, but the physical distance 
between the two institutions inevitably delayed such a 
union. In 1897, after Columbia had removed to her 
present site near Teachers College, the time seemed ripe 
for completing the contemplated arrangement. Accord- 
ingly in 1898 a reorganization was effected, whereby 
President Low became ew-officio President of Teachers 
College, and Professor James E. Russell, lately called to 
the Chair of the History of Education in Teachers College, 
became its Dean, having the charge of its educational 
   
-P-A-G-E-517
TEACHERS COLLEGE 415 
and financial administration, under the general direction 1898 
of the Trustees of Teachers College and the President of 
the University. The privileges of students in the matter 
of electing courses to count for degrees were thus ex- 
tended, and the number of such elections at once began 
notably to increase. More students of Teachers College 
elected courses in Columbia and Barnard, and more 
students from those institutions were registered in the 
classes of Teachers College. Teachers College was thus 
brought into full standing as the school of education of 
Columbia University, in much the same status as its 
School of Medicine and its School of Law. 
But the work of the officers of the College was, though 
now clearly defined, still only in its beginnings. The 
Faculty has since been increased and strengthened, new 
courses offered and old courses made better, new depart- 
ments established, and, in general, an improvement of the 
work to keep it nearer to a university standard. Among 
the more notable advances of the work have been the 
researches, in the science, history, and art of education, 
and the higher standards set for students preparing to do 
special work in secondary schools. 
Perhaps the increase in the work of the College can be 
indicated in part by a brief summary of the opportunities 
now presented to its students. A graduate of a secondary 
school, able to pass the College entrance examination, may 
enter upon a four years’ College course and receive at the 
end of it the degree of Bachelor of Science, and, accord- 
ing to his elections, a diploma to teach in either art, 
manual training, kindergarten, elementary schools, or 
some one or more subjects in high schools. To equip 
himself fully in any special subjects, he may elect courses 
in his specialty at Columbia College, or, in the case of 
women, at Barnard College. A student with two years 
of College training or with a diploma from a good normal 
school may enter upon the two years of professional 
 
-P-A-G-E-518
416 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1904 training of Teachers College, and win the same degree 
and diploma as described above. Students of Columbia 
and Barnard Colleges may take one of the diplomas of 
Teachers College along with their Bachelor of Arts de- 
gree. For advanced work in education students may 
win a master’s or a doctor’s diploma, bearing the same 
relation to the first or lower diploma of the College as 
do the master’s and doctor’s degrees to the bachelor’s. 
Graduates of these or other colleges in good standing 
may enter upon their graduate work at Columbia Univer- 
sity, choosing education as either a major or a minor 
subject, and having it recognized for the degrees of A.M. 
and Ph.D. on precisely the same plane as work in any 
other subject. Thus, briefly stated, we have a full reali- 
zation of the plan of President Barnard, already referred to 
in these pages, of a teachers’ college on a university basis. 
That the educational world is ready for such a scheme 
has been shown in many ways. Other universities are 
adopting some of its features. The demand for students 
trained at Teachers College, particularly for the higher 
grades of work, exceeds the supply. The number of 
graduate students in the department of education is 
greater than in any other department of the University. 
The number of students in Teachers College, including 
its academic courses, has steadily increased. The an- 
nouncement of the current year records a total of 855 
resident students, distributed as follows: Graduate stu- 
dents, 106; students in the undergraduate professional 
course, 418; students in the undergraduate academic course, 
88; students not candidates for a degree or diploma, 59 ; 
students from Columbia and Barnard Colleges, 189. 
In addition to its resident work the College has main- 
tained, since its beginning, a certain amount of extension 
work. These extension courses, now limited principally 
to courses for teachers, have covered most of the common 
   
-P-A-G-E-519
  TEACHERS COLLEGE 417 
departments of college study, as well as education. By 1904 
1903 the work had assumed such proportions as to lead to 
the organization of it as a separate department of the 
University, and the appointment of a Director, Professor 
Frederic H. Sykes, to take charge of the work. This 
department now offers courses of instruction and courses 
of lectures, either at the College or in local centres, such 
as the Brooklyn Institute, on enough subjects to make it 
possible for a student to cover the ground required for a 
degree by attending extension classes only. During the 
coming year the College will be opened several nights 
each week; and the time may not be far off when a 
student of ability and energy may complete a course lead- 
ing to a degree by attending evening classes. 
In vital connection with the work of the College almost 
from the beginning has been the Horace Mann School. 
It was opened in 1888 with 64 pupils as a school of obser- 
vation and practice. In 1898 it had 895 pupils, and, in 
1904, 878 pupils. Its earlier character, like that of the 
College, was mainly manual and technical. Like the 
College it has departed from the somewhat narrow 
character of a propagandist organization to the broader 
one of giving a general education in which manual train- 
ing is a part. The steady pressure from its patronage 
has made the high school department largely preparatory 
for college ; and its students are now found in most of 
the prominent eastern colleges. 
The Speyer School, housed at Lawrence Street, near 
Amsterdam Avenue, in a building given and equipped by 
Mr. James Speyer, is an attempt to do for the community 
in which it stands the work of a good school plus the 
work of a college settlement. The special relation of this

    Ill.—THE COLLEGE OF PHARMACY 
In the year 1829 a number of the leading apothecaries 
of the city became convinced that the best interests of 
their profession required that some special training be 
provided for those who intended to engage in the prac- 
tice of pharmacy. At a meeting held on the 18th 
of March of that year, John L. Embree acting as chair- 
man and Theodore Keese as secretary, the establishment 
of the College was resolved upon and a constitution was 
adopted. Seventy-two signatures were affixed to the 
constitution, and those familiar with the history of that 
time would recognize in the list the names not only of 
the leading pharmacists, but of many citizens best known 
for their interest in the general welfare of the commu- 
nity. The last surviving incorporator was Mr. George 
N. Lawrence, who died in 1895. 
The first officers were John D. Keese, President ; 
Henry H. Schieffelin (whose grandson, Dr. William Jay 
Schieffelin, occupied the same position in 1903), first Vice- 
president ; John L. Embree, second, and Waldron H. 
Post, third Vice-president ; Theodore Keese, Treasurer ; 
Oliver Hull, Secretary. These, with seven other mem- 
bers, constituted the first Board of Trustees. A charter 
was granted on the 25th of April, 1881, to continue 
in force for twenty-five years, empowering the College 
to hold property to the extent of $20,000. At the expi- 
ration of that period a new charter was granted, which 
has since been amended, and the College is now empowered 
to hold property to the value of a million dollars. In 
1879 the College became a branch of the University of

  THE COLLEGE OF PHARMACY

-P-A-G-E-523
  THE COLLEGE OF PHARMACY 419 
the State of New York, and on July 1, 1904, the College 1831 
was affiliated with Columbia University. 
It was the belief of the founders of the College that in 
an occupation involving so many technicalities as that of 
pharmacy practical experience and school training should 
go hand in hand, and they provided that one of the con- 
ditions of graduation should be four years of experience 
in a pharmacy, two of which might be those in which the 
two required courses of lectures were given. These two 
lecture courses constituted at the outset the whole of the 
school instruction. They were given in the evening in 
the small room of the New York Dispensary, at White 
and Centre streets, the second course being merely a 
repetition of the first. Dr. John Torrey lectured on 
chemistry, and Dr. Stephen Brown on materia medica. 
The annual fee for tuition was $6. By 1861 this fee had 
been increased to $15, and it has since been increased. 
gradually, until it now stands at $100 per annum. Con- 
sidering the amount and character of the instruction given, 
this fee is little more than nominal. The College has been 
led to keep its fee as low as possible in order to encourage 
students to take a pharmacy course instead of entering the 
profession by the back door of apprenticeship only, as the 
law at present permits. 
In 1830 lectures on pharmacy were differentiated from 
those on materia medica. In 1831 the College graduated 
its first class of three members. Ten years later a course 
in practical botany, under the direction of Dr. C. R. Mc- 
Clellan, was instituted. In these eleven years the grad- 
uates had numbered thirty-nine. The class of eight 
graduates recorded in 1837 was not afterward exceeded 
until 1861, when there were nine, increased to eleven in 
1870. In the meantime instruction had been given in 
the chemical laboratory of Columbia College, in the 
rooms of the Lyceum of Natural History, in the rooms 
of the New York University, in the City Hall, a room of

1869 which was sublet by the Mechanics Institute, with a re- 
turn, in 1836, to the original quarters in the Dispensary. 
In 1845 the College work was conducted over Lock- 
wood’s bookstore at 411 Broadway. In 1849, Professor 
R. Ogden Doremus having been engaged as lecturer in 
chemistry, that department was conducted in the pro- 
fessor’s room in the New York Medical College at 19 
East 13th Street. In 1857 Dr. George Thurber, a close 
friend of Dr. Torrey, was appointed lecturer in pharmacy 
and materia medica, and added a course of botanical lec- 
tures. The latter lectures were omitted in 1858-1859, 
but were resumed in 1860. From 1865 to 1867 Professor 
Chandler lectured on chemistry in his room in the School 
of Mines of Columbia College, his place being taken in 
1868 by Professor Arthur M. Edwards. 
The.year 1869 was one of the most notable in the history 
of the College. Professor Chandler resumed the chemistry 
lectures, and Dr. E. R. Squibb assumed charge of the 
Department of Pharmacy. Dr. Walter De Forest Day 
presided over the Department of Botany and Materia 
Medica, the lectures in botany being delivered in the 
chapel of the University. Dr. Day also added a short 
course of lectures in physiology. The attendance of stu- 
dents at once began to increase, and in the following year 
a class of eleven members was graduated. Three years 
later, when Peter W. Bedford became Professor of Phar- 
macy, and Charles Froebel director of the Department of 
Analytical Chemistry, the graduating class numbered 
thirty-three, an increase of 200 per cent over the 
largest preceding class. The size of the graduating class 
steadily increased from that time until, in 1894, it num- 
bered one hundred and twenty-eight. Partly owing to the 
increase in the size of the classes, but more as a result of 
the increased demand for laboratory instruction which 
then began to be felt, the College determined, in 1878, to 
have a properly equipped building of its own, and the 
 
-P-A-G-E-525
  THE COLLEGE OF PHARMACY 421 
disused building of Grace Chapel, 209-211 East 23d 1883 
Street, was purchased and fitted up, and with it was sub- 
sequently connected the adjoining building upon the 
east. In 1879 Dr. Alphonso Wood was elected Professor 
of Botany. In 1883 a pharmaceutical laboratory was 
established under the direction of Professor C. W. Par- 
sons, and this was followed, in 1885, by a laboratory for 
pharmacognosy, under the direction of Professor Joseph 
Schrenk. In 1883 attendance at recitations, previously 
voluntary, was made obligatory. In the same year 
entrance requirements were established, but some years 
later the College felt itself obliged, as a result of un- 
principled competition, to retrace this advanced step. In 
1883, also, the work of the school was graded, the second 
course of lectures representing advanced work, and the 
laboratory instruction was greatly improved. In 1885 
the requirement of the presentation of a thesis as a condi- 
tion for graduation was abandoned. About 1889 the 
attendance of students underwent a large increase, the 
number of the graduating class advanced from eighty-seven 
to one hundred and six, and the necessity for a further in- 
crease in accommodations forced itself upon the attention 
of the Trustees, but more especially upon that of the 
Faculty, and the purchase of land and the erection of a 
building was determined upon. On various preceding 
oceasions the members of the corporation have manifested 
their liberality in sustaining the College through criti- 
cal periods. In 1836 $5500 had been subscribed; the 
purchase of Grace Chapel had been made possible only 
through the subscription of $10,000 by the drug trade, 
and when a much more ambitious undertaking was con- 
templated, the same generous spirit placed a fund of more 
than $30,000 at the service of the institution. The pres- 
ent college building at 115-119 West 68th Street was 
completed in 1894, involving the corporation in a debt of 
nearly $150,000. The finances have been most carefully  
-P-A-G-E-526
  422 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1885 handled, and the debt has been reduced by more than a 
sixth, but the presence of so serious an obligation has 
proved an obstruction to educational interests, and it has 
retarded the College in attaining the best results. In all 
of its later struggles, however, the College organization 
has been fortunate in enjoying the codperation and sup- 
port of the German Apothecaries’ Association of this city 
and of the Alumni Association of the College. The 
former society has not only subscribed liberally to all 
funds for new enterprises and for the cancellation of 
the debt, but its influence has been most valuable in con- 
serving educational standards. 
The Alumni Association was founded on May 24, 1871, 
chiefly through the efforts of Professor P. W. Bedford. 
Twenty-four members were enrolled, and Mr. Daniel C. 
Robbins was elected President. Incorporation was not 
effected until November, 1888. This action was promptly 
followed by a large growth in membership and influence. 
The Association has encouraged the undergraduates, 
supplied postgraduate students, fostered social relations 
among the graduates, conducted lecture courses, main- 
tained a journal, supplied teaching apparatus, and sub- 
scribed liberally to the building and other funds. Under 
the leadership of Mr. Charles S. Erb, the Association is 
now active and prosperous. 
In 1885 a very important step was taken in transferring 
the lectures from the evening to the afternoon hours, a 
change which was so successful that gradually the course 
was extended so as to occupy the entire day. No sooner 
had the facilities afforded by the new building begun to 
be appreciated in 1894 than the importance of establish- 
ing a postgraduate course of instruction was realized, and 
such a course was instituted in the fall of 1895. Its 
classes have never been large, although twenty-one 
students were enrolled in 1903-1904, fifteen of whom re- 
ceived their degree. In the same year the Department  
-P-A-G-E-527
    
      THE COLLEGE OF PHARMACY 423    
of Microscopy was reorganized, under the direction of 1904 
Professor S. E. Jelliffe, and the Department of Micro- 
scopical Pharmacognosy has since been by him highly 
developed. 
Since 1895 the instruction has week highly specialized. 
Chemistry is taught in three separate departments: gen- 
eral chemistry under Professors Virgil Coblentz and John 
, Oehler, organic chemistry under Professors Charles F. 
Chandler and John Oehler, and analytical chemistry 
under Professor George A. Ferguson. Besides this a 
course of lectures in physiological chemistry is given to 
the postgraduates by Professor George C. Dickman, the 
professor of pharmacy. Lectures and laboratory work in 
botany and lectures in physiology are given to the first- 
year men, and lectures in materia medica and toxicology, 
with laboratory work in commercial pharmacognosy, to the 
second-year men, by the writer. The term extends from 
the first Monday in October to the end of April. At 
the conclusion of the two years’ work, which includes 
suitable practical and theoretical examinations, the can- 
didate, having had four years’ experience in the prac- 
tice of pharmacy and being twenty-one years of age, 
receives the degree of Graduate in Pharmacy. The post- 
graduate course of one term’s work leads to the degree 
of Doctor of Pharmacy. The instruction and require- 
ments of this course are of a high order, including organic 
and inorganic chemistry, physiological chemistry, system- 
atic botany, technical microscopy, and bacteriology. 
The equipment of the College is well adapted for its 
needs. No educational institution in the city has a larger 
or finer lecture hall. The pharmaceutical and chemical 
laboratories accommodate one hundred and fifty students, 
and the microscopical laboratory, seventy-five students. 
There is also a dispensing laboratory where the students 
are trained in the actual reading and filling of prescrip- 
tions, as well as a museum of drugs and a reference her-

1904 barium of three hundred thousand specimens, besides two 
smaller herbaria for teaching purposes. The College pos- 
sesses one of the largest pharmaceutical libraries in the 
country, and is abundantly supplied with apparatus, 
charts, and models. The instruction is of a practical char- 
acter, most of the text-books being in the nature of lab- 
oratory guides, written especially by the professors to 
accompany their own courses of instruction. 
From the very beginning the instruction of under- 
graduates has been regarded as only one of the functions 
of the institution. The association of those engaged in the 
practice of pharmacy for the promotion of professional in- 
terests was provided for by the constitution of the corpora- 
tion. Membership was open to any one then engaged as a 
druggist or apothecary in New York County, but none 
thereafter taking up the business was eligible unless prop- 
erly educated. The initiation fee was fixed at $5, and an 
equal amount was to be paid annually. Non-resident drug- 
gists and apothecaries, and those who had retired from 
business, might become honorary members, and there 
might be elected each year to honorary membership one 
distinguished man of science not resident in the county. 
The trustees were empowered to publish important litera- 
ture for the enlightenment of pharmacists. These func- 
tions of the College have been performed uninterruptedly, 
and very much of the important work that has been accom- 
plished in pharmacy, some of it national in character, has 
thus originated. The first laws for regulating the quality 
of drug importations, and prevention of frauds, originated 
in a resolution adopted by the Trustees of the College, 
which was also largely instrumental in bringing about the 
organization of the American Pharmaceutical Association. 
It has participated regularly in the revision of the Phar- 
macopeia, and its methods of inspection and certification 
of weights and measures resulted in a great increase in 
the care practised in the preparation of and commerce in

these important standards. A crusade against dishonest 1904 
drugs and medicines has been carried on in this city dur- 
ing the past year by its representatives on the Board of 
Pharmacy, and successful efforts have been made in aid 
of the passage of a state law requiring all candidates for 
licenses to practise pharmacy to be graduates of some 
acceptable school of pharmacy.

BOOK FIVE 
THE LIBRARY 
THERE is no greater mistake than that which is some- 
times made, perhaps often made, by those who are ill- 
informed as to the history of this country, when they think 
of the people of the early colonies as ignorant or illiterate, 
or as knowing little or nothing of the refinements of life 
on either its social or material side. Asa matter of fact, a 
large proportion of the men in each colony were scholarly 
and refined in their tastes as the result of a scholarly and 
refined ancestry. The gentlemen who were the first 
officers of King’s College were of this class, and it is en- 
tirely natural therefore that they should have recognized 
the place and value of the printed page as an accessory to 
all sound education. 
All things were in the beginning, however, with the 
new College; and it is not surprising that the record of 
library matters seems scanty even to the point of insig- 
nificance. Yet to one who knows the history of the Col- 
lege in all its departments, it is entirely evident that the 
department of books has kept quite even pace with its 
associates. 
In the Laws and Orders of the College, first issued 
June 8, 1755, there is no reference to the Library ; and in 
the Body of Laws, issued March 2, 1763, there is a doubt- 
ful reference only —“ The President shall have power to 
appoint what Books the Students are to read.” It is more 
probable that this refers to text-books than to a library 
collection. 
427 
 
-P-A-G-E-532
428 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1756 Yet from the earliest list of benefactors of King’s Col- 
lege, prepared in 1756, it appears that “Joseph Murray, 
Esq., bequeathed his estate and library, about £8000.” 
“The Rev. Dr. Bristow, of London, bequeathed his li- 
brary, about 1500 volumes.” ‘“ Mr. Noel, book-seller, gave 
Roman’s Ed. of M. Calasio’s Hebr. concordance, 4 vols. 
fol.” “Sundry gentlemen at Oxford gave books, whose 
names are in them.” This record is not quite accurate, 
because Dr. Bristow really gave his library to the Society 
for the Propagation of the Gospel, suggesting that the 
Society give it to the College of New York or to other 
institutions named, and the Society gave it to the Col- 
lege. 
Whether Dr. Bristow’s entire bequest ever reached the 
College is doubtful. In the “ Rough Minutes of the Gov- 
ernors of King’s College,” at the regular annual meeting, 
held in the City of New York on the second Tuesday in 
May, 1761, “ Dr. Johnson Communicated to the board a 
Letter which he received from the Rev’d Dr. Bearcroft 
in which he Desires some Directions about the Library 
of Books given to this Corporation by the Revd Dr. 
Bristow, whereupon it is Ordered that Dr. Johnson write 
to Dr. Bearcroft Requesting him to Deliver the said Li- 
brary to Mr. William Neat of London when he shall Chuse 
to call for them—and Mr. Marston is requested to write 
to the said Mr. Neat, Desiring him that as soon as there is 
a peace he will Call on Dr. Bearcroft for the said Library 
and Send it over in the best and most reasonable manner 
he can and to Insure when shipt.” Later, at the annual 
meeting of the Governors of the College, May 10, 1763 : 
“Mr. Marston communicated a Letter from Mr. William 
Neat & Company of London Acquainting him that they 
had shipt nine Boxes of Books the Gift of the late Rev'd 
Dr. Bristow to the College which the Governors have 
received — ordered that Mr. Marston be desired to thank 
them for their generosity and Care and pay the freight 
 
-P-A-G-E-533
THE LIBRARY 429 
and Other expences Attending the same which the treas- 1763 
urer is desired to Repay Mr. Marston.” 
Nothing satisfactory seems to have come of this ship- 
ment, for at a meeting of the Governors of the College on 
Tuesday, the twenty-third day of October, 1764: “Re- 
‘solved that Mr. Marston be requested to write to Mr. 
Neat to Inquire what is become of the Remainder of the 
Library left to the College by Dr. Bristow and to desire 
him to Ship them as soon as possible upon the best and 
most reasonable terms he can: ” and still later, at a meet- 
ing of the Governors, December 17, 1765: “Ordered that 
the Rev’d Auchmuty and Mr. Cooper be Desired to write 
to Doctor Bristow, the Society’s secretary, to inquire 
what has become of the Remainder of doctor Bristow’s 
library given to the Corporation and that he be requested 
to put them into the Hands of Mr. Neate in order to be 
sent over as soon as Conveniently may be.” 
The first payment for books of which we have any 
record is that on the fifth day of January, 1762, 
“Ordered that the Treasurer of this Corporation pay to 
Mr. Garnat Noel the sum of £5 4s. in full of his account 
for Books supplied the College.” 
The first reference to a Librarian seems to be contained 
in the record of the meeting of the Governors held on the 
first day of March, 1768, when “It is resolved that a 
Librarian be appointed for the College and that he be 
allowed a salary of £10 per annum and that Mr. Harpur, 
the mathematical teacher in the College, be and he is 
hereby selected and appointed to that office till further 
order. 
“Ordered that the said Mr. Harpur make a catalogue of 
the Books that now are and hereafter may belong to the 
Library and deliver a Copy thereof to the President of 
the College and another to the Clerk of this Corporation 
and also that he be accountable for the said Books.” 
The troublous times of the Revolution brought great 
 
-P-A-G-E-534
430 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1776 distress to the young College. In 1776, upon receipt of a 
demand that the College be prepared for the reception of 
troops, the Library was deposited in the City Hall. Of 
the loss thus occasioned President Moore says: “ A large 
proportion of the books belonging to the College was 
wholly lost in consequence of this removal; and of the 
books recovered, six or seven hundred volumes were 
recovered only after thirty years, when they were found, 
with as many belonging to the New York Society Library 
and some belonging to Trinity Church, in a room in St. 
Paul’s Chapel ; where it seems no one but the sexton had 
been aware of their existence, and neither he nor any body 
else could tell how they arrived there. Previous to this 
disposal of the College Library, it contained, besides books 
purchased by the Governors and those bequeathed by Dr. 
Bristow and Mr. Murray, many valuable works given by 
the Earle of Bute and other individuals, and from the 
University of Oxford a copy of every work printed at the 
University Press.” 
Although the advertisements in the current press prove 
that the Governors of the College met during the Revolu- 
tion, the records of these meetings are not to be found. 
The College loyally changed its name from “King’s” to 
“Columbia,” and its Governors became Regents. At a 
meeting of a Committee of the Regents on August 25, 
1784, information was received that “The students of 
Columbia College with a number of others of the city had 
formed a Society for the purpose of improving themselves 
in polite literature and requested 4 chamber in the College 
to be assigned for their use.” It was resolved that “ the 
Committee approve of the Society and that they be per- 
mitted to deposit their books in the College Library, and 
that the librarian of the Society be Librarian of the Col- 
lege until the Regents shall make further order therein.” 
Ata meeting of the Regents in the Senate Chamber in 
New York, in December of the same year, it was resolved

  THE LIBRARY 431 
that the “ Following appointments be made. A President, 1785 
a Secretary, a Librarian.” At the same meeting it was 
resolved “That the Librarian be responsible for the 
Library and give security for the books under his care, 
to be subject to the direction of the Regents and to attend 
at such time in the Library room as may be thought 
proper.” 
In 1785 the Corporation was informed that “Major 
Edward Clark, by will which he executed some time before 
the late war, bequeathed to the Governors of the College 
lately called King’s and now Columbia College £1000 
sterling to be laid out for Books in addition to the then 
College Library : that he charged his Hyde Estate a very 
valuable plantation in the Island of Jamaica with the 
payment of such legacy which he ordered to be paid 
within two years after his death. That he appointed 
several gentlemen some residing in England and some in 
the said Island of Jamaica together with Goldbrow Ban- 
yar, Esq., and said Mr. Duane to be executors of his said 
Will a Duplicate whereof is in their possession. That 
Major Clark has since died leaving, it is supposed but not 
with certainty, the said will in full force. Whereupon 
Resolved, that the Treasurer take such measures as the 
Law directs for the Recovery of the said Legacy and that 
the seal of this Corporation be affixed to the necessary 
powers for that purpose.” 
What came of this, if anything, it is now exceedingly 
difficult to determine. Certain it is that not much followed, 
for at a meeting of the Trustees on the 26th of November, 
1787, a report was made of the condition of the College 
in which it was stated that there was then no Librarian 
and that “the College has scarcely any Library.” 
On April 11, 1792, an Act of the Legislature was 
passed “ To encourage literature by donations to Columbia 
College” (and several academies), which granted $1500 
“to enlarge the Library.” Three months later the 
 
-P-A-G-E-538
    
432 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1799 Trustees ordered that “the surplus monies from study- 
rents and fines be applied by the Faculty of Arts to the 
purchase of books for the Library.” 
In September of the same year a Committee, consisting 
of Dr. Johnson, Dr. Romayne, and Dr. Livingston, was 
authorized to confer with Mr. Francis Childs about pur- 
chasing books for the Library — and £750 were granted for 
this purpose, with an allowance of 5 per cent commission 
to Mr. Childs. 
At a meeting held “at the house of John Simmons, 
Innkeeper,” on Tuesday the 24th of December, 1793, 
“Resolved that a Committee be appointed together with 
the Faculty of Arts to appropriate the last of the money 
granted by the Regents toward enlarging the Library of 
the College in purchasing such books as they shall think 
proper: and that Dr. Bard and Mr. B. Livingston and 
Mr. E. Livingston be the Committee for that purpose.” 
At a meeting of the Trustees held May 5, 1794, «A 
letter of the 15th of January last was received from John 
Hamilton, Esq., British Consul at Norfolk in Virginia, 
directed to the President of the New York College in- 
forming him that he had received from the Governor of 
Bermuda, a set of books for the said College as a present 
left by the author, Francis Maseres, Esq., and that he had 
forwarded the same.” 
It was not until 1799 that we have a record of rules for 
the use of the Library. Ata meeting of the Trustees in 
November of that year it was “ Resolved that the care of 
the Library be committed to the Professor of Languages 
and the Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy 
who shall superintend the same in such order as they shall 
agree, and according to the following general rules : — 
“1. The use of the Library is limited to the Trustees 
of the College, the Faculties of Arts and of Medicine and 
their students. 
“2, No person except a Trustee, a member of either
-P-A-G-E-539
THE LIBRARY 433 
Faculty or a student of Medicine when preparing a thesis 1814 for a Doctor’s degree can take out more than one volume 
at a time. 
“3. The time allowed for borrowing a volume, the penalty for exceeding it, and for damage or loss, shall be the same as those in the regulations of the City Library. 
“4. No book shall be issued to any person not residing 
in the city. 
“5. One of the Professors who have the care of the 
Library shall attend one hour every Saturday from twelve to one o’clock for delivery and receiving of books, and a correct account thereof and of all delinquencies in the 
use thereof shall be constantly kept in a book prepared 
for this purpose.” 
That the progress of the Library was slow and unsatis- 
factory is to be gathered from the following records : — 
At a meeting of the Trustees on January 20,1812, a 
petition was directed to the Legislature in which among 
other conditions which “seem to require the earliest 
attention” is mentioned the following : — 
“ Provision for the Library, the appearance and condition 
of which are humiliating to the College and reproachful 
to the public character.” 
At a meeting of the Trustees, January 11, 1813, a 
second petition was directed to the Legislature in which it 
was stated “ That the College Library is far from being as 
respectable as the character and interests of the Seminary 
require.” 
At a meeting of the Trustees on Monday, March 7, 
1814, a further memorial and petition to the Legislature 
was read and adopted, in which it is stated that “ The 
Library of the College which fell a sacrifice to the War of 
Independence has never been replaced but in so slender 
degree as to make it a subject of ignominious Comparison 
with the prominence in this Respect of other American 
Colleges. .. . There is no proper Apartment for the 
Reception of a decent Library.”

-P-A-G-E-540
  434 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
In the report on the condition of the College, made 
February 28, 1817, the attention of the Trustees is called 
to the fact that “Many valuable books from the College 
Library are missing, and no record is to be found by 
which they may be recovered. Books at present are not 
loaned to the students. To prevent further loss the key 
of the Library is now in the possession of the Presi- 
dent. Should the Trustees deem it expedient to appoint 
an assistant Professor, the Board respectfully suggests 
whether it would not be advisable to commit to him the care 
of the Library that at stated times it should be made his 
duty to deliver books to the students and that he should 
receive from them a reasonable compensation for his 
trouble.” 
In the report of the Committee of Visitation, presented 
on May 5, 1817, it is stated “That the Library of the 
College is in a very neglected state and appears not to be 
under the special charge of any particular person ; and 
the Committee recommends that the youngest Professor 
should be appointed Librarian with a suitable compensa- 
tion ; and that a Committee to consist of two or more 
Trustees be appointed annually, to be denominated the 
Library Committee, whose duty it shall be to inspect the 
state of the Library, to make a catalogue of the books, 
to devise rules for its regulation, to purchase books under 
the authority of the Trustees, and generally to attend to 
the preservation and improvement of the Library.” 
The first appointment of an Assistant Librarian seems 
to have been made at a meeting of the Trustees on May 
8, 1819; a Mr. Meaker, “A young man of good char- 
acter and a good scholar,” but whose father “is poor and 
has a large family to support,” was allowed to pursue his 
studies free of expense on the condition that he assisted 
the Librarian in the performance of his duties during the 
first three years, and the Professor of Natural Philosophy 
in the care of apparatus during the senior year.

THE LIBRARY 435 
Early in the year 1821 the Trustees adopted a new body 1838 
of statutes, under which the Library was to be in general 
charge of a committee of the Trustees, and the Junior 
professor was e2-oficio Librarian under the direction of 
the Trustees. The only persons privileged to take books 
from the Library were the Trustees of the College, the 
President and Professors, the students of the senior and 
junior classes, and “such of the graduates of the College 
residing in the city of New York as shall contribute 
toward the expenses of the Library the sum of four dollars 
annually ;” and the Library was ordered to be opened for 
the purposes of delivery of books from twelve to two 
o’clock every Saturday. 
In 1825 the first really valuable addition was made, —that 
of the purchase of Lorenzo Da Ponte’s library, which gave 
Columbia its first collection of Italian poets and miscella- 
neous literature. It was not until 1838 that another notable 
advance was taken, when the Trustees secured the library 
of Professor Moore. This was especially rich in the 
classics and in philology, and included many excellent and 
some quite beautiful editions of Italian literature. What 
was even more important, Professor Moore himself was 
engaged to put the whole Library in order and to arrange 
it for more convenient use. Previous to that date (1837) 
there had never been a regular incumbent of the office 
devoting himself entirely to its duties and to the interest 
of the Library. Professor Renwick, Professor Anderson, 
and Professor Vermilye had united the offices of Librarian 
with their instructional duties. 
Professor Moore made the first catalogue of the Library, 
in manuscript, which was in use as late as 1865. 
Up to 1835 only the two higher classes wore permitted 
to use the Library, but in that year the sophomore class 
was granted the same privilege. In 1838 still further 
liberality of administration was shown by a resolution to 
permit “such members of the freshman class as the Presi-
-P-A-G-E-542
  
436 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
1889 dent may especially designate” to have the privilege of 
taking books from the College Library, subject to regula- 
tions applicable to other classes. In 1839 the uses of the 
Library were still further enlarged by permission granted 
to the teachers of the Columbia Grammar School, and such 
students as the Rector may recommend, to take out books, 
“provided that the Rector hold himself personally respon- 
sible for the safe return of the same.” 
But that this was still a day of small things is evident 
from the report of a Special Committee, made in July, 
1843, in which it was stated: that the annual expenses 
for the Library had not exceeded $100. 
Professor Moore was followed in 1839 by George C. 
Schaeffer, who was succeeded in 1847 by Lefroy Raven- 
hill, A.M., M.D., who had been assistant Librarian for 
a few years. Dr. Ravenhill died in 1851, and was suc- 
ceeded by William Alfred Jones, A.M. 
Under Dr. Ravenhill served as an assistant Stephen 
Rowe Weeks, who was also janitor of the College. Mr. 
Weeks continued to serve both as janitor and as assistant 
librarian, until Mr. Dewey’s incumbency, when he was 
placed in charge of the Shelf Department, retiring in 1887 
because of advancing years and physical infirmities. He 
was one of the pensioners of the College from 1887 until 
his death a few years later. In some of the catalogues of his 
day his name appears as that of assistant librarian only, in 
some as janitor only, and in some as janitor and assistant 
librarian, —but he served in both capacities, almost con- 
tinuously, and is remembered as one of the most faithful 
of the earlier minor officers. 
Mr. Jones was a peculiarly active and efficient officer 
and did much to bring the Library into notice and promi- 
nence, and especially perfected its records. It was he who 
discovered or at least called attention to the signature of 
Ben Jonson in the heroic Latin poem “Gustavidos,” 
printed at Leyden in 1531. 
   
-P-A-G-E-543
  THE LIBRARY 437 
It is not easy to determine the number of volumes in the 1857 
Library at any stated time, but in the catalogue for the 
academic year 1849-1850 it appears as 15,000. Two years 
later it is said to be 15,500... The next year it was 16,000. 
Then for several years it was stated as 20,000. Our copy 
of the catalogue for 1856-1857 places the number at 20,000 ; 
but some one, presumably Professor Joy, as the catalogue 
came from his collection and the writing seems to be his, 
corrects this in ink to 15,000. In May, 1862, the number 
was stated as 14,000, and the statement was made that the 
increase in five years has been 2379 volumes. 
The Minutes of the Trustees’ meeting for December 13, 
1852, show that the salary of the Librarian was “ raised ” 
to $300 a year. 
It was not until 1857 that favorable mention is found 
concerning either the Library or its rooms. In May of 
that year, speaking of the College and its new location, 
the Evening Post said, “'The east wing is occupied by the 
Chapel and by the extensive Library of the College.” 
It was in that year also that the first reference to 
the Library (except to the number of books) appears 
in the annual catalogue. The paragraph states briefly 
that the students of the senior, junior, and sophomore 
classes, and such of the freshman class as may be desig- 
nated by the President, shall have access to the College 
Library and be permitted to take books therefrom on the 
days and at the hours appointed for that purpose so long as 
they observe the rules duly established. It also states that 
there were then 16,000 volumes in the College Library. 
In the catalogue of the following year the hours of the 
Library are given as from 1 to 3 p.m. —days not mentioned. 
In 1861, June meeting of the Trustees, “A resolution 
reduced the salaries of officers of the College” as follows : 
“the Librarian to $900.” Mr. Jones was at that time the 
Librarian, and in the same year he published an article in 
the University Quarterly which stated that “the Library 
 
-P-A-G-E-544
438 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
  1863 amounts to upward of 13,000 volumes, after deducting 
850 volumes which have been removed to the library of 
the Law School.” At that time the hall in which the 
books were contained was 65 feet long by 28 feet wide in 
the clear, in addition to an adjoining room, shelved on 
three sides and capable of containing about 2000 volumes. 
In 1863, in the year preceding Dr. Barnard’s assump- 
tion of office, the Library was reported as possessing 
14,941 volumes, exclusive of pamphlets, but the collection 
was a choice one, especially in classical literature. Its 
use was confined to College officers, members of the 
upper classes, and such freshmen as might be designated 
by the President. It was open for delivery of books 
from 1 to 3 P.M. five days in the week during term 
time, holidays excepted. 
Apparently it was not until the spring of 1867 that the 
Library possessed a reading room. At that time, on ap- 
plication, the Standing Committee of the Trustees was 
authorized to fit up a room in the College building with 
tables, chairs, and other conveniences to serve as a reading 
room “and place of resort” for the professors and other 
officers of instruction in the College. 
In 1868 there is a memorandum that the number of 
books in the College Library, ascertained by actual count 
after the Library of the School of Mines was withdrawn, 
was 13,795. 
February 7, 1881, a plan presented by the Building 
Committee for a Library building was approved, with 
rooms for instruction on the first floor. The Committee 
was authorized to direct the construction of the building 
and provide the necessary furniture and necessary heat- 
ing and ventilating apparatus, and an appropriation of 
$284,000 was made for that purpose. 
June 5, 1882, an appropriation of $16,320 was made for 
furniture for the Library and Observatory — afterwards 
increased to $30,200 — still further increased (in October,

-P-A-G-E-547
THE LIBRARY 439 
1884) by $2500 for the Library building and $5000 for 1883 
furniture for the Library and Observatory. 
In 1881 the Library received a most valuable gift, by a 
provision made in the will of Stephen Whitney Phenix 
Gn 1876), by which his entire and choice collection of 
about 7000 volumes was transferred to the College. This 
collection has been maintained intact and is still one of 
the most valuable in the Library. 
In 1874 the first printed catalogue was issued, as far as 
can be determined,—a thousand copies being printed at 
an expense of something over $1200. Even then it was 
painfully realized that a printed catalogue is dead matter 
twenty-four hours after it leaves the press. 
In 1883 was completed at a cost of over $400,000 a fire- 
proof building for the Library, for the accommodation of 
the School of Law, and for an Astronomical Observatory; 
and on the completion of this Library Hall, the several 
libraries were consolidated into one collection. In this 
year also provision was made for a Librarian in Chief, at 
a salary of $3500, to enter upon his duties upon the first 
day of July; and to this position Melvil Dewey, M.A., was 
appointed, and was given the sum of $2000 for the organ- 
ization of a staff service. Giving full credit to all who 
had labored in behalf of the Library in former years, it is 
hardly too much to say that this unification of the libra- 
ries of Columbia under one efficient administration, with 
reasonable resources for the organization of staff service, 
marks the beginning of the Library of to-day. From that 
date forward appropriations have steadily increased, gifts 
have multiplied, and although present resources are by 
no means commensurate with present needs, the fruits of 
Mr. Dewey’s enthusiasm and quite extraordinary admin- 
istrative power are clearly recognized, and the stimulus 
then given to the upbuilding of the Library and to its 
intelligent use is still felt in every department of the 
University.  
-P-A-G-E-548
  
440 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
In 1889, at the close of Dr. Barnard’s presidency, the 
general and technical libraries had been united and were 
all housed in a fine building constructed for that purpose 
on the College block. The Library contained 99,433 
volumes and 20,000 pamphlets; more than 500 different 
serials, including the leading periodicals, transactions of 
societies, etc., were regularly received ; it was open to all 
officers, students, and graduates for borrowing and refer- 
ence daily (including holidays and vacations) except Sun- 
days, Good Friday, the Fourth of July, Thanksgiving Day, 
and Christmas. 
In January of that year Mr. Dewey’s resignation was 
presented and accepted, and he withdrew to inaugurate 
the great State Library School over which he still pre- 
sides, at Albany. Mr. George H. Baker, his then assist- 
ant, was placed at the head of the Library, and so remained 
for ten years. The present incumbent took office July 
1, 1899. 
In 1890 Mr. and Mrs. Samuel P. Avery took the first 
steps towards the establishment of the Avery Library, 
which, under their fostering care and large and intelligent 
generosity, has become one of the most notable collections 
of its kind in this country; devoted exclusively to archi- 
tecture, decorative art, and landscape gardening, and buy- 
ing largely those books which the average architect cannot 
afford to buy or which are so rare as to be off the general 
market. This collection is extensively used by the best 
architects of this country, and its influence in the develop- 
ment of sound art and good taste is widespread and gen- 
erally and gratefully acknowledged. 
In March, 1898, announcement was made of the gift of 
Joseph F. Loubat (Duc de Loubat) of property valued at 
$1,100,000, the property or its proceeds to be applied, 
after the death of the donor, to the endowment of a fund 
to be known as the Gaillard-Loubat Library Endowment 
Fund. 
   
-P-A-G-E-549
  THE LIBRARY 441 
In 1895 President Low, with that remarkable generosity 1904 
and large foresight for which he is noted, offered to be- 
come responsible for the cost of a new University Library 
building to an amount not to exceed $1,000,000, to be 
erected in memory of his father ; and the present struc- 
ture, one of the most stately and beautiful buildings in 
this country, stands as a constant reminder of the large- 
minded and unselfish citizenship of both the father and 
the son. 
At present the collections immediately available to the 
officers, students, and graduates of Columbia, and (upon 
introduction) to “persons of mature years desiring to 
engage in definite research which cannot be successfully 
conducted in the public or other libraries of the city,” are 
as follows : — '

During the academic year 1903-1904 all the collections

Columbia University were placed under the general care 
of the Librarian of the University, with instructions to 
secure the most complete unification possible of all ad- 
ministration.

APPENDIX A 
“New York, May 31, 1754. 
ADVERTISEMENT 
To such Parents as have now (or expect to have) Children 
prepared to be educated in the College of New York. 
I. As the Gentlemen who are appointed by the Assembly, 
to the Trustees of the intended Seminary or College of New 
York, have thought fit to appoint me to take the Charge of it, 
and have concluded to set up a Course of Tuition in the learned 
Languages, and in the Liberal Arts and Sciences: They have 
judged it advisible that I should publish this Advertisement, to inform such as have Children ready for a College Education, 
that it is proposed to begin Tuition upon the first Day of July 
next, at the Vestry Room in the new School-House, adjoining to 
Trinity Church in New York, which the Gentlemen of the 
Vestry are so good as to favour them with the Use of it in the 
Interim, till a convenient Place may be built. 
II. The lowest Qualifications they have judged requisite in 
order to Admission into the said College, are as follows, viz. That they be able to read well, and write a good legible Hand; 
and that they be well versed in the Five first Rules in Arithmetic, 
i.e. as far as Division and Reduction ; And as to Latin and 
Greek, That they have a good Knowledge in the Grammars, 
and be able to make grammatical Latin, and both in construing 
and parsing, to give a good Account of two or three of the first 
select Orations of Tully, and of the first Books of Virgil’s 
Aineid, and some of the first Chapter of the Gospel of St. John, 
in Greek. In these Books therefore they may expect to be ex- amined ; but higher Qualifications must hereafter be expected : 
and if there be any of the higher Classes in any College, or un- der private Instruction, that incline to come hither, they may 
expect Admission to proportionably higher Classes here. 
III. And that People may be better satisfied in sending 
their Children for Education to this College, it is to be under- 
stood that as to Religion, there is no Intention to impose on 
the Scholars, the peculiar Tenets of any particular Sect of 
443 
 
-P-A-G-E-554
  444 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
Christians; but to inculcate upon their tender Minds, the great 
Principles of Christianity and Morality, in which true Chris- 
tians of each Denomination are generally agreed. And as to 
the daily Worship in the College Morning and Evening, it is 
proposed that it should, ordinarily, consist of such a Collection 
of Lessons, Prayers and Praises of the Liturgy of the Church, 
as are, for the most Part, taken out of the Holy Scriptures, and 
such as are agreed on by the Trustees, to be in the best Manner 
expressive of our common Christianity ; and, as to any peculiar 
Tenets, everyone is left to judge freely for himself, and to be 
required only to attend constantly at such Places of Worship, 
on the Lord’s Day, as their Parents or Guardians shall think fit 
to order or permit. 
IV. The chief Thing that is aimed at in this College is, to 
teach and engage the Children to know God in Jesus Christ, and 
to love and serve him, in all Sobriety, Godliness, and Righteous- 
ness of Life, with a perfect Heart, and a willing Mind; and to 
train them up in all virtuous Habits, and all such useful 
Knowledge as may render them creditable to their Families 
and Friends, Ornaments to their Country and useful to the 
public Weal in their Generations. To which good Purposes, it 
is earnestly desired, that their Parents, Guardians and Masters, 
would train them up from their Cradles, under strict Govern- 
ment, and in all Seriousness, Virtue and Industry, that they 
may be qualified to make orderly and tractable Members of 
this Society; — and above all, that in order hereunto, they be 
very careful themselves, to set them good: Examples of true 
Piety and Virtue in their own Conduct. For as Examples 
have a very powerful Influence over young Minds, and espe- 
cially those of their Parents, in vain are they solicitous for a 
good Education for their Children, if they themselves set be- 
fore them Examples of Impiety and Profaneness, or of any 
sort of Vice whatsoever. 
V. And, lastly, a serious, virtuous, and industrious Course 
of Life, being first provided for, it is further the Design of 
this College, to instruct and perfect the Youth in the Learned 
Languages, and in the Arts of reasoning exactly, of writing 
correctly, and speaking eloquently ; and in the Arts of nwmber- 
ing and measuring ; of Surveying and Navigation, of Geography 
and History, of Husbandry, Commerce and Government, and in 
the Knowledge of all Nature in the Heavens above us, and in 
the Air, Water and Earth around us, and the various kinds of 
Meteors, Stones, Mines and Minerals, Plants and Animals, and 
of every Thing useful for the Comfort, the Convenience and 
Elegance of Life, in the chief Manufactures relating to any 
of these Things: And, finally, to lead them from the Study 
of Nature to the Knowledge of themselves, and of the God of 
 
-P-A-G-E-555
APPENDIX A 445 
Nature, and their Duty to him, themselves, and one another, 
and every Thing that can contribute to their true Happiness, 
both here and hereafter. 
Thus much, Gentlemen, it was thought proper to advertise 
you of, concerning the Nature and Design of this College: And 
I pray God, it may be attended with all the Success you can 
wish, for the best Good of the rising Generations; to which, 
(while I continue here), I shall willingly contribute my En- 
deavours to the Utmost of my Power. 
Who am, Gentlemen, your Friend And most humble 
Servant. 
SAMUEL JOHNSON. 
N.B. The Charge of the Tuition is established by the 
Trustees to be only 25s. for each Quarter.”

dent’s or his Tutor’s leave, unless at the Stated Vacation, upon 
Penalty of Five Shillings, and for repeating his Fault he shall

One Week at Michaelmass, and a Fortnight at Christmas and 
Easter Week, i.e. from Good Fryday till the Fryday following, 
which last being so near Commencement is to be Considered as 
only a Vacation from Exercises but not from the College or 
Dayly Morning and Evening Prayers, and so does not come 
within the last Prohibition. 
All the Fines shall be paid to the Treasurer of the College to 
be laid out in Books and disposed of as a reward to such of the 
Schollars as shall Excell in the Course of their Studies in their 
severall Classes as the President Professors and Tutors or the 
Major part of them shall Direct. 
Under this scheme, President Johnson, who was at first 
sole instructor, confined himself, after the regular organi- 
zation of the College, to instruction in Greek, Logic, 
Metaphysics, and Ethics. 
The plan of education recommended by the Committee 
to supersede that just given, and adopted by the Gov- 
ernors March 1, 1763, was as follows, as quoted from the

    APPENDIX C 
CONSPECTUS OF “NEW CURRICULUM, TO GO INTO 
EFFECT JULY 1, 1897” 
Tue curriculum requires an elementary knowledge of both 
French and German of all candidates for the degree of Bach- 
elor of Arts. In the case of students who offer Greek at en- 
trance, one modern language is required for admission, and a 
five-hour course in the second modern language is prescribed 
during the Freshman year. Students are encouraged to offer 
both modern languages at entrance, as they will then be re- 
lieved of the obligation to pursue a modern language during 
the Freshman year, and the time thus gained may be devoted 
to elective studies. 
Students who do not offer Greek at entrance must offer both 
French and German, and are thus relieved of the obligation to 
pursue one of those studies in College. On the other hand, 
they must take in rhetoric, a five-hour course during the 
Freshman year. 
But one alternative for Greek is allowed, namely, advanced 
mathematics, natural science, and a second modern language. 
All candidates for admission to the Freshman class must 
pass satisfactory examinations in the following subjects : — 
ENGLISH, LATIN, and MATHEMATICS, 
and also in one of the following groups of subjects: 
ADVANCED MATHEMATICS meee CHEMISTRY 
GREEK GREEK Puysics 
Frexcn { Gurman ga reset 8 or ATURAL SCIENCE Borne. 
wit LABoRATORY WorK 
Students are designated in accordance with the subjects they 
present at entrance, as follows: — 
457 
 
-P-A-G-E-568
    458 A HISTORY OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
Group I. Offering Greek and French. 
Group II. Offering Greek and German. 
Group III. Offering advanced mathematics, natural science, 
French and German. 
One approved course, covering a year, in a Natural Science 
including laboratory work, must be taken by every candidate 
for the degree either before entrance or while in College. The 
entrance requirement in Natural Science satisfies this condition. 
Laboratory hours are counted for one-half the number of hours 
actually occupied. 
Group I— Students entering on Greek and French 
Freshman Year 
Preseribed (12 hours): Latin A or B, or Greek B; Ger- 
man A; Mathematics A; Rhetoric A. 
Elective (8 hours): French I; History I; Either Latin A 
or B or Greek B, —i.e. Latin, if the student has taken 
Greek as his prescribed ancient language, or vice versa ; 
Chemistry I; Physics I. 
Sophomore Year 
Prescribed (7 hours): History A; Rhetoric B; one of the 
following: Botany I, Chemistry I, III, IV, Physics I, 
II, Zodlogy II. 
Elective (9 hours): A Sophomore may take courses desig- 
nated as open to him in the several departmental 
statements. 
Group II — Students entering on Greek and German

Group II — Students entering on advanced Mathematics, natural 
science, French and German

Prescribed (6 hours): Latin A or B; Rhetoric A. 
Elective (9 hours): As in Group I, with the substitution 
of Greek A for Greek B, and with the addition of 
Chemistry III, IV, German I, Mathematics I, II, 
Mechanical Engineering I, and Physics II. 
Sophomore Year 
Prescribed (4 hours): History A; Rhetoric B. 
Elective (12 hours): As in Group I. 
Junior Year Aur Groups 
Prescribed (3 hours): Philosophy A (first half-year) ; Politi- 
cal Economy A (second half-year). 
Elective (12 hours): A Junior may elect courses designated 
as open to him in the several departmental statements. 
Senior Year 
A senior is required to take fifteen hours a week of elective 
courses, and may elect courses designated as open to 
him in the several departmental statements. If he 
became a student in the College not later than the 
beginning of his Junior year, the first year courses in 
the College of Physicians and Surgeons, the School of 
Law, and the Schools of Applied Science are open to 
him, and he may, should he so desire, prepare himself 
for advanced standing in such schools by electing the 
first year course in the school selected, in whole or in 
part, and counting it for the degree of Bachelor of 
Arts: he may also take subjects of the second year in 
the Schools of Applied Science, for which he may be 
qualified. 
By a judicious arrangement of his course, a student may 
qualify himself to enter the second year in the College 
of Physicians and Surgeons or the School of Law, or 
the third year in one of the Schools of Applied 
Science, at the completion of his collegiate course for 
the degree of Bachelor of Arts. 
1 Rhetoric A for this class of students will be a five-hour course count- 
ing as three hours, unless the student elects Greek A.

hours shall be counted for one-half of the number of hours 
actually occupied. Not less than twelve, nor more than eigh- 
teen, points may be presented in any one year without the 
consent of the Dean. No one-hour course, unless taken in con- 
nection with and as a supplement to a cognate course, will be
